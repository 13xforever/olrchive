00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky and Lowkey!

00:14.000 --> 00:20.540
Tonight September 11th, 2011, details leak on the new 3DS circle pad, Xbox Live issues

00:20.540 --> 00:28.000
bans for theft, and is the Wii U running into problems?

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of that show

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
We are live on this Sunday night and you can head over to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
if you want to participate live in our chatroom.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
If you want to hear the stream, hopefully you're already on the stream,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
but I'll say it for the sake of the podcast listeners,

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
you can tune in Sunday nights at www.allgames.com

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
First off, say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Hi.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
How are you, Miss Summers?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Hungry.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
You're hungry, but it looks like you're eating over there,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
so you're getting that hunger problem fixed, right?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
It's very nutritious.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Nutritious, delicious?

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
It's brown rice and tempeh with okonomiyaki sauce.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I love brown rice and vegetables.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Really?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Alright, no.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
It's worse than dog food?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Really?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Dog it, chow.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Also, say hello to the one, the only, tech master, Loki.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Hello.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
And how are you, Loki?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
I'm fine.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
And of course, to answer the question in our chat room,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
what did you get for dinner tonight?

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Well, I got another double bacon western burger,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
but I'm not even really that hungry,

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
but I figured if I don't eat something, I'm going to be hungry later,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
because I had a big lunch, but it was round one.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
If I don't eat anything between 1 o'clock and 11 o'clock or whatever,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I'll probably be starving by 11.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
You know what I had to hold me over for tonight's show is a frappuccino.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
That's the food I had this week.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
But I will be getting something more substantial after the show.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Hey, it's pumpkin spice frappuccino.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
It's really good.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Alright.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
What is your kick with pumpkin spice lately?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
This is my favorite time of year.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I love pumpkin.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
I love pumpkin pie.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
They have pumpkin pop tarts now, and oh my gosh,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
they now make Hershey's Kisses that are pumpkin spice flavored.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
It's heaven.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
It's great.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
And they don't pay me to say that.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
It really is that good.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Or to quote Rob from Wow last night,

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
it tastes like world peace.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
It did taste like world peace.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Alright, we do have a guest on tonight's show.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
At least he's going to join us for at least the first half here.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
And it's someone that used to come to OLR all the time,

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
but we have not seen her in a very, very long time.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
I think you guys will be pleasantly surprised to hear back on the show,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Miss Irene is joining us tonight.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
How are you?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm good.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
You guys might've known her as Rice Princess about a hundred episodes ago,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
but I think she has left that name behind.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
You know, it's okay to use it for Orange Land Radio,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
because that's how people know me here.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
I don't understand when you do want a nickname.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Like when does Prince want to be Prince?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
He's always Prince.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Oh yeah, I'm like Prince 2.0.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Alright.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Well, welcome back to the show Rice Princess.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Thank you.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
What's new in your world?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Let me have you reintroduce yourself for those that are like newer to Orange

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Land Radio who weren't here a hundred episodes ago.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
You're a gamer girl, obviously.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Sort of.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I mean, like, yeah, I don't know.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
I've kind of...

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
What, you don't play games anymore?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
I thought you did.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
It's not that I'm not interested in playing games.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I just don't have time.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
But I would if I could.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Have you been playing anything lately?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
No.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Really?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
No.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I thought you and your boyfriend had a Wii,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
and at least were playing stuff on that, or is it mostly him?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
It's mostly him.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I have a Gamefly account, and he'll get games,

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
and then I'll watch him play them,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
but I just don't have the energy to play anything.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, then get off the show.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm just kidding.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
But you do love your classic games at least, right?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
I do.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
And I mean, like I said, I will play games when I have the time.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Just I'm very busy.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Alright.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
You kind of sound like a lot like Salacious Pop last week who mentioned

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
when he was here that he's more into like gaming culture.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Yes.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
That's kind of the thing.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
So that's kind of where you're at too.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Well, what would you say are like some of the best video games ever made?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Your favorites?

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Well, like my favorite is Chrono Trigger.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Final Fantasy Tactics is like it's pretty close to Chrono Trigger.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Super Metroid.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Just like really from the Super Nintendo era,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
most of the games on the Super Nintendo.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Like Super Nintendo was just like perfect gaming, wasn't it?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
That was the golden system.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yes, it was.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I agree in many ways.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I don't know if gaming will ever be that good ever again.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Like gaming is just different now.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Oh, yeah.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
It just is.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Especially like a game I was playing this week that I'll get into later

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
in my gaming week is like it's like interacting with a movie now.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
It's like it's like it's not I mean, it's not a bad thing.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
It's just you know, and maybe this is a little bit of get off my lawn

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
syndrome, but it's just not the same like it was.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
No, no, you know.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
OK, so if you have been listening for a while, you know that I hate

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Microsoft and like the Xbox systems that they have.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
But we actually ended up buying one.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Like I finally allowed my boyfriend to let to have one in the house,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
which is a huge deal because when you were on the show before,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
you were very staunch, anti Microsoft, anti Xbox.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Yes, but.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Oh, what?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yes, I am.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
No, no, I just mean console wise, like I don't like Microsoft,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
but the Wii is a piece of shit.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
The PS3 is way too much and they don't have any good games.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
And it's just he really wanted one.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
And I'm like, fine, you know, I can't hold them back any longer.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
It kind of I have to admit that it's probably the best system out right

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
now, console wise.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
So but when we get games on that console,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I really feel like an idiot, like a retard.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Like, I don't know what I'm doing.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
They're all first person shooter controls.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
And like you kind of have to go to game college to to like learn the

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
controls on these games.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
It's crazy.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
You want to go back and just play puzzle fighter?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I want two buttons on my controller.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
God damn it.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm tired of all this stupid bullshit.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
But no, I mean,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
I guess it just takes a little bit more effort to learn how to play a game.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
But I don't know.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Some of the games are pretty good.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here on the show tonight?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Usually our guests want to plug something.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
No, not really.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
OK. Thought I thought I'd offer.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
All right.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Well, you'll be joining us throughout the show and offer your witty insight

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
and commentary. Please do.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Maybe as we continue on throughout tonight's show.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Dark Soccer wants her mic back.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
I really like your Avengers T-shirt.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Thank you very much.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
All right.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
I just looked over and saw Ms. Marvel and it made me happy.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
I want to get into a couple discussion topics before we get into tonight's

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
gaming weeks and all that, how we always start off the show.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
But I have to mention this at some point.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Today's a very big day.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I have to address the elephant in the room.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
It is September 11th, 2011,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
which obviously 10 years ago was a horrible,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
horrible day that we should never forget.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
I was fortunate when I was 17 years old.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
I got to go to the Trade Center and I have a very vivid memory of being on

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
the roof of the Trade Center.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
But I drove by it with a big hole in it.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Oh, when you it was right after the bottom floor got bombed.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Oh, gosh.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
That's when I was 17.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Wow. And it's just, you know, the whole thing,

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
watching it on TV was just just just so difficult and everything.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
And, you know, we have a lot of listeners in New York City and Washington

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
and back east and all those places that were affected.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
And it's like, you know, the impact we felt three thousand miles away.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
I can't even imagine just that experience.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
So, you know, we should never forget what happened.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
However, it is important, you know, video games.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
It's something that we do to escape sometimes the pains the real world.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I know when I have a shitty day at work,

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
I like to come home and blast things on my Xbox. It's fun.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
So, you know, if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise just kick the cat.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Stop. You do not. You love your cat.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
If we can make you laugh on what is otherwise,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
she wouldn't feel it. No, she wouldn't.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
I do pet her with my foot, though, so I don't have to bend over.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
As I was saying, if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise kind of a tough day for some people,

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
then I think we've done our job. So and fuck terrorists like seriously.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Fuck them. They suck. So if we do what we do.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Then they don't get it. We can commemorate something else today.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
That's right. Let's move on, because something else monumental happened today 31 years ago.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
And you know what that is? Loki was born, everybody. It's Loki's birthday.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Yay. Happy birthday, Loki.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
So in commemoration, it looks like Irene has actually brought over some bacon cupcakes for Loki.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I love this. Did you get a picture up on the website?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Yes, I did. Awesome.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
They should be on orangejonesradio.com. Go look at it now.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
I'll eat them later. I can't eat them right now. I'm too full from the other bacon stuff.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I really shouldn't have eaten that. It was too much.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
It's like milkshake or bacon burger.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
It's like bacon burger. Should have gone with the milkshake.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
So any good video game related loot for your birthday or not yet?

09:08.000 --> 09:17.000
Nope. Well, someone, I really hate not remembering. Someone gifted me Xbox Live code last night.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I didn't get to check what it was for yet.

09:20.000 --> 09:29.000
So that's kind of cool. You'll have to check that out. Let's see.

09:29.000 --> 09:39.000
I was going to look up real quick. Ryan Belnap gifted me something from Xbox Live.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
I will go check that out and I really appreciate it. I didn't really get on my Xbox today.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
It was like last night sucked. My cat was being an asshole.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
So I didn't get it. Hardly any sleep. Maybe a few hours.

09:54.000 --> 10:01.000
Today I ended up sleeping in and then it was out to lunch and then came back.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
I was messing with Grand Theft Auto stuff. Didn't get a chance to boot it back up again.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
Well, I hope your birthday is awesome and congratulations.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Thank you.

10:12.000 --> 10:20.000
We're all in our 30s now. So it's the podcast. Oh, not Irene, but you're just visiting tonight.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
So yeah, we're now the podcast for those in their mid 30s. Awesome.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Whatever. I understand what's hip and cool nowadays.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Except for toy trends, I don't understand that crap.

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
I think they're just making all sorts of weird shit up now and kids are just buying it and I don't get it.

10:38.000 --> 10:46.000
You know what? When kids are maybe about one and a half and younger, they don't care.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
They'll play with the box, save some money and buy them a box.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
I seem to recall, Josh, your kid really loved the Kinect calibration card.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Still does.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Still does. The wacky, creepy happy face.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
They're like, babies are like cats.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
You can go buy the most expensive cat toy ever, but they don't care. They want to play with the twist ties and the box.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
So if you drop them from six feet, they'll land on all fours?

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
No. I said they're like cats. I didn't say they were cats.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
And besides that, it's not like they have clear vision until they're, you know, 10 months old anyway.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
It is pretty true that they do like all sorts of random stuff.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
Usually, I mean, he'll chase after sunlight on the floor.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
So pretty much anything amuses him.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Save money, everybody. Don't buy them toys. Buy them twist ties.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
There you go. All right, going to a couple of discussion topics here before we get into our gaming weeks.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
I want to mention this comment from our chat room. Of course, the chat room is always live with us.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
chat.orangelaundry.com

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
This, I think, is an interesting follow-up to what I believe Irene was saying a minute ago

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
when she was kind of talking about how she had a distaste for Xbox for so long

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
and kind of just got over it and has one in the house now.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
I like this comment from Eric K. I'm curious what you guys think about it.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
I'm more loyal to games than systems anyway.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
Kind of an interesting comment, and I see Irene shaking her head over there.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
What do you think of that comment?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I was nodding my head.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Shaking it up and down, of course.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Yes, of course.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
No, I mean, I can understand that.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
Well, really, okay, when we grew up, we only had one system in the house at a time.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
We didn't have a Genesis and a Super Nintendo and all that stuff.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
I think we all grew up in families that couldn't afford that.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Except for you.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
No, I didn't have a Genesis and a Nintendo and all that stuff at the same time.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I only ever had Nintendo systems.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I had a Nintendo, Super Nintendo.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Well, I lied because then I had a PlayStation, but I didn't have a 64.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Yeah, I've been pretty loyal to Nintendo.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I threw away a 64 one day.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Oh my gosh.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Well, I bought it from my ex-girlfriend's brother at the time, and then I was just like,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I don't want this, so I threw it away.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
You just threw it away.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Exactly.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
No, it wasn't even, it was way later.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
I just decided one day I didn't want it anymore, so I threw it away. Carry on, carry on.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
No, it was way later.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
We're talking like in the 2000s when I bought the Super Nintendo 64.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
It wasn't, you know, it wasn't a new system by any means.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
We still had our Clicca vision when I was a kid, and then we got, my dad got me a NES,

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
and then I had a SNES, and then I traded with my friend and had his Genesis for a while,

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
traded back, and then rented a TurboGrafx for like my graduation deal or something.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
And then my friend's, my roommate's boyfriend left his PlayStation in the room

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
because he didn't have a TV in my dorm room.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
So I did have multiple systems, but it was because of circumstance.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
So I think it all goes with the golden rule of gaming, going back to the comment, you know,

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
what we always say here on Orange Andrea, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
I was very much, you know, an Xbox hater for the first generation of Xbox systems,

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
but then after that, it was just kind of alright.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Well, when I borrowed my friend's Genesis, he had a power-based converter

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
and tons of Master System games too, so.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
I think PlayStation 3 is coming an awfully long way too.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
You know, when they first came out, they were kind of the laughing stock of the industry,

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
and for many good reasons, but you know, despite the hack earlier this year,

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
which I still say, Microsoft isn't as invulnerable as all y'all think.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Remember, I had $150 stolen just last month.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I have a follow-up on that I'm going to get to in a minute, by the way.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
But I think PlayStation 3 is coming off a long way since then.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I think they got a lot of really good stuff going for them there.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
Obviously, Little Big Planet is like one of my favorite games ever to come out this generation,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
so lots of good stuff.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Anyhow, other things I want to talk about.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I guess I'll mention the Xbox Live hack.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Okay, if you go back about, what, four weeks ago on the show,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
I talked about how I had money stolen from my Xbox Live account,

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
called Microsoft, was told that in 21 days, they'd get the money back and whatever.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
I got an email from them about 25 days after.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
It was about Wednesday, saying that they, you know, apologized for the inconvenience,

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
duh-duh-duh, but they did the investigation and that they concluded it was indeed fraudulent

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
and I will be getting the money back on my account.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
And then they sent me like three separate codes for one month of Xbox Live Gold.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
So I guess the cool thing is, even though I haven't been able to play my Xbox for the past 21 days,

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
25 days, month basically, I got the codes.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
So now I got to extend out my Xbox Live Gold for three months.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
So I guess that's cool, but I'm still waiting for the money because the email I got said,

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
it may take up to 10 days for the money to actually get credited to your credit card or whatever.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
And I'm just like, oh my God, it's been over a month.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
That's 150 bucks I had to eat for a month.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
I mean, luckily I have a savings account, but it's just kind of irritating.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
I mean, really, it takes that long to figure out that a different IP and different MAC address,

15:55.000 --> 16:01.000
Xbox, probably in another country, logged in and did it, you know, it's just, come on.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
But whatever, at least it's on the path to getting fixed

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
and I was able to finally play the 360 this week a little bit.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I'll talk in a moment about some things I was playing on there.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
One other thing I want to bring up because I was thinking about this today.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
I was at Fry's, which obviously is a big retailer out here on the West Coast,

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
a big electronics store, and was looking at 3DS games randomly.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
And, you know, Star Fox 64 just came out.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
And I was looking at the Namco Generations had just come out as well,

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
which is, you know, for us folks that like our retro games, it's like a Pac-Man reimagining,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Pac-Man Championship Edition, I think Galaga.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
It's a Pac-Man and Galaga Legions, or Dimensions, I'm sorry.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Yeah, you know, Dimensions, so it's all like 3D and all that stuff.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
And I was really tempted to get it.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Don't.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Well, here's the thing, I looked at the price tag and I was like, it's 40 bucks.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
40 bucks?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
3DS games are 40 bucks.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I get that, but...

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I know, it's Pac-Man.

16:53.000 --> 17:01.000
It's interesting to me because they just recently cut the cost of the 3DS from $250 to $160.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
But I don't know if that's really the problem.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
The problem are those games.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Those games are too expensive.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I'll talk to my Namco guy.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
He's like, dude, I got tons of 3DS games.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Well, I just ended up giving them away to my friends.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I'm like, sweet, cool, send me some.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
I mean, I'm not gonna say no to that, that's for sure.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
But for the masses and everybody out there, and even other games, like Star Fox 64,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I might have considered buying it if it was 20 bucks.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah, you know why?

17:25.000 --> 17:33.000
It's because they claim that it takes extra development time to develop the extra dimension

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
or whatever it is.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Or maybe the dev kids cost a little bit more.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
No, the cost more for the other dimension is a load of turd because they came out and

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
they said any game that uses a z-axis in calculation, you can easily adapt it to 3DS.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Well, yeah, it's just another virtual camera.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
It's ridiculous.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
Anybody who says that that extra dimension should cost more money is full of crap.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
No, it's just because it's a new generation, they think they can up the prices.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
And I think that's gonna be the problem holding it back.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
You know, and it's interesting to me because there's been a lot of talk lately about how

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
stubborn Nintendo has been and how much they have really not liked the mobile gaming stuff

18:10.000 --> 18:17.000
because 99-cent Angry Birds has been cheapening, quote-unquote, the game industry as a whole.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
And I'm kind of like, well, I don't think 99-cent Angry Birds is the reason why I feel

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
like a $40 Pac-Man Galaga game is a rip-off.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
I don't care how many dimensions the fucking game has.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
I'm just like, $40 is a lot.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
Nintendo's dumb in the sense that they think that a game like Angry Birds, a very basic

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
physics puzzler game, I mean, didn't take that much to develop.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
I mean, it was probably just a couple guys in a room, you know, putting it together real quick.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
Done. Game, you just create levels and you're done.

18:49.000 --> 18:54.000
They could make a Super Mario Bros. game, like a Super Mario Bros. episodic game running

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
on the All-Stars engine or something like that and make new levels in a level editor,

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
charge 99-cents, and people eat that shit up.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
You could have just like 20 levels in it.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
It wouldn't take that long to even make.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
You don't have to do anything new.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Just make new levels.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Done. 99-cents.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
You put it right out there, everyone will buy that shit.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
The price of all these games really has to make me stop and think about what I really want.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
I mean, you know, even $60 for a 360 or PlayStation 3 game is asking a lot of money.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
And there's only a certain kind of game that I'm willing to pay that for.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
Gone are the days that you would just pick up a game on a whim.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
You know what I mean?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Like, remember when you just, yeah, pick up a game on a whim.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
It looks interesting. I'll try it.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
You know, those days really seem gone.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
Looking at the holiday, there's so many games coming out and I'm really having to choose,

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
like, okay, I gotta drop 60 bucks on all these games.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
What am I actually gonna buy? Skyrim.

19:46.000 --> 19:54.000
See, that's the thing, though, is, yes, gone are the days of buying something on a whim,

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
not necessarily playing something on a whim, especially some, you know,

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
how easy it is to pirate things nowadays on certain systems.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Yeah, but that's a whole nother Oprah.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
You know what I mean?

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Like, it's just, not even going into the piracy angle.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Let's just say that most people don't do that.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I don't, I don't...

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
A lot of stuff, like, I'll look at games, you know, they're coming out, I'm like,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
hey, you know what, that'd be kind of cool to get, but then I ask myself,

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
am I really gonna play this?

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
Because I have a lot of games that I buy and end up not really playing or finishing or something,

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
and I figure I should just finish the ones I have first and then buy the ones I really want

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
and end up just not missing the ones I end up skipping on.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
You know, interesting comment in our chat room.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
Part Machine in our chat says, if people played PC games, this would not be a problem.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
Interesting that that comment is said because one of the places where I do buy things on a whim,

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
just because they're cheap and they look interesting, is Steam.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
You know, I bought a game on there for like $1.50 the other day.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
Why? Because it was $1.50 and it was a puzzler and it looked interesting and I like puzzle games.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
And if it sucks, eh, it's only $1.50, right?

21:03.000 --> 21:11.000
So, funny enough, that is the place where I tend to spend a little more frivolously.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
So, I don't... maybe he's right.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
Well, just like, you know, like virtual console stuff. Remember, virtual console stuff is like $6 a pop for NES games.

21:21.000 --> 21:28.000
I mean, fuck, you can get those NES games in NES form on cartridges for a lot cheaper than that.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
And I just, I don't see the point, especially when they're not doing anything.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
They're dumping a ROM into an emulator. Why should I give you money for that?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I can go download that for free.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
Is this a rant about the Mario 25th Anniversary Collection disc?

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
Oh! Well, that's just stupid. And I knew that from the get-go.

21:46.000 --> 21:53.000
I'm like, okay, whoever buys this is retarded because all it is is it's just, it's literally a port of the game and they did nothing to it.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Nothing at all to the game.

21:55.000 --> 22:01.000
And, oh, it has a soundtrack in there, but because it says Mario 25th Anniversary Edition, people are gonna eat that stuff up.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
And you know what? That right there, that game is a perfect analogy of Nintendo and its consumer base.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
People will bitch and moan that they don't get their import game in there, but you know what?

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
You're the same dumb fuckers that are buying a game that they didn't change, that they released on the system a long time ago,

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
and they're selling for, I'm guessing, more than what the game actually costs anyways.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
You only have yourself to blame for Nintendo having $40 games on the 3DS.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
It's because you're an idiot and you will buy this $30 Mario game. That's literally wrong.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
They could have put it on the Virtual Console, sold it for $10, and went with it in the same damn game.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
But no, Nintendo being smart, they said, hey, you know what? We're gonna charge $30 for it.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
We'll call it limited edition. We're actually gonna make it limited.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
And now that shit goes on eBay for like $80 because people are dumb.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
Well, at the same token, today I said no to buying that game.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
I looked at the game and I said, this looks really good, but I'm gonna wait for it to end up in the clearance bin.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
Yeah, and I know, I mean, I said the same thing about the Mario game. I'm like, eh, screw it.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
But at the same time, a lot of other people didn't, and they're all sold out.

23:10.000 --> 23:17.000
And I understand, yeah, they may have been quite limited, but we're talking limited as in a few hundred thousand copies.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
I mean, that's a lot of money that they made from a ROM.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
Speaking of PC games, that chat comment has me thinking, and Steam and Good Deals, I've gotta plug this.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
I just, I have to. As a fan of this game, Civilization V is on sale right now.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
And probably by the time the podcastees hear this, the sale will probably be done, because I think it was just the weekend.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
But at least for the live folks, it's like $12.50 right now for Civ V.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
My favorite Civilization since the original, for real.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
That's the game that last week on the show I said I was up until 2 in the morning playing one night,

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
because, wow, where did the time go? With friends.

23:50.000 --> 23:56.000
So, if you like strategy games, even in the slightest, or if you've ever enjoyed a Civilization game a little bit,

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
you should drop the money to check it out. For real.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
So, anyhow, I guess we should move on and talk about our gaming weeks.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
So, we always like to start off the show with talking about our gaming weeks,

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
even if we're not really starting the show with it, but whatever, play along.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I played WoW.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
WoW? What a different week for you.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
I got Rebecca Black to 80.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
I think it's funny you have a character named Rebecca Black that hasn't had a change.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
I made it as a total joke.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
That hasn't had a change your name yet.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
No. Well, I'm not gonna pay to change your name. If they want me to change your name, they're gonna give me a free name change.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
They usually do.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
And then I'm gonna name her Becca Black.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Or maybe Lady Ark Music.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Friday?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Friday, that'd be funny.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
Well, I was gonna change Fatty Cakes to Ursulal, but I like Fatty Cakes.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
And then I played some Tiny Tower and Sims.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
I played Sims 3 and the stupid other Sims.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
This freaking addicting as I thought.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Sims Facebook.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I just completely rearranged my house while you were here.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
Sims Facebook is one of those things I am ashamed to admit I play.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
It's fun.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
No, it's terrible.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
It's great. It's really actually just like playing Sims except, you know, you can't rotate your house.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
Here's the thing. They have got to cool it with the posting to the wall and all that stuff.

25:12.000 --> 25:19.000
Like, I thought that they went after the makers of Farmville because that shit was spamming everything too much.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
And you can't tell me. Sims Social, like, Slices Pop was telling me.

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
He tried to find a video that he posted to my wall and he couldn't find it amongst all the bullshit Sims Social posts.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
And you can block the app, but that only goes so far.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Like, then when you go to the page, it doesn't show anything.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
You keep having to load because that Sims Social posts so much stuff.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
I mean, it's just...

25:39.000 --> 25:45.000
I want the game to come out on Google Plus because at least Google Plus kind of exiles that all to one.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Like, the game stuff all has to be on a separate page.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Yeah.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
I really want Sims Social on Google Plus, but they probably won't bring it there for that reason.

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
That's probably how they've got an assload of players is because it's all over Facebook.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And people are like, the Sims? I love that game.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
I'm pissed off that my mother hasn't become my neighbor and I'm going to fuss at her.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
No, I'm kidding.

26:04.000 --> 26:11.000
But I'm apparently, though, in the game, randomly dating, like, one of my old friends from the AOL days.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
I am actually a dating Mistress Tia, if you remember her from the show.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
We're boyfriend and girlfriend in Sims Social, and she came over for some woohoo the other day.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
I can't woohoo my girlfriend in-game because she doesn't have a double bed, but we can play in the bathtub.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Wow!

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
You can click on the bathtub and woohoo in the bathtub.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
It's going to be one of those weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I found the mod, by the way, for Sims 3.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Wait, don't you have a spa in your house? You can't woohoo in the spa?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
At her house.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Trust me, you can woohoo in the spa.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
At her house.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Oh, okay. I see.

26:42.000 --> 26:49.000
But I did find there's a patch for Sims 3 where you can change woohoo to fuck.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Nice.

26:50.000 --> 26:58.000
And they're finally breaking the animations where they're doing items with custom animations, so everyone look toward Sexy Sims 2 for new mods.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Because I had a ton of them on Sims 2 because I'm a little prevert.

27:02.000 --> 27:12.000
I also played some Osotatakeo Endon while I was at school because I was bored.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
I started reading a book, but I don't like it, so I'm not going to read it anymore.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
I have to write a review on it, so look on Geek Life for the Too Long Didn't Read.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Alright.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Plug.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Let's move on to Techmaster Loki. How was your gaming week?

27:27.000 --> 27:33.000
Didn't play a ton of different things, mainly just Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon.

27:33.000 --> 27:40.000
I'm starting to level up my jet character now, so that's at level 5, I believe.

27:40.000 --> 27:46.000
And my tactical's at 8, and just playing a little bit more of that.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
We were trying to play some of the remixed missions on Inferno.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
It's as hard as Inferno on the first game, which is really hard.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
Then more Grand Theft Auto stuff. I've been messing around with that.

27:58.000 --> 28:06.000
And made some new mods that no one's done yet, so I'll have to work on that stuff later on.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
What else did I play?

28:09.000 --> 28:16.000
I think that's pretty much it. I tried that vid rhythm once, and it was just kind of like, eh.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
Which didn't end up being a game. Although the app itself is kind of a neat concept.

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
It's a fun little, huh, neat. You run it and you go, huh, neat.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
But it's not a game, and I was kind of disappointed by that.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
Because I wanted Harmonix to do an awesome frequency game on the iPhone.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
That didn't happen. I'm sad.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
There's nothing really rhythm about it. It's just vid record clip.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Vid clippin'.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Pretty much, yeah.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
Anything else in your gaming week?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
That's it.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
I know, Irene, you said you've been very busy at school lately.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
Is there anything that you have been playing in the past week or so that you want to acknowledge?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Guild Wars.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Oh, you've been playing Guild Wars. Like old school Guild Wars, huh? How's that been going for you?

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
Well, it's been going well.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
What do you do in Guild Wars? Why do you keep playing Guild Wars?

29:15.000 --> 29:25.000
Because it's free and I don't have a lot of time to play, so I won't feel like a stupid bitch if I pay $15 a month for a game that I never play.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
So Guild Wars, I've always kind of called the game, at least there's always Guild Wars.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
You know, when you have to quit WoW and Final Fantasy XI or whatever your MMO addiction is of choice,

29:36.000 --> 29:43.000
at least there's always Guild Wars if you've bought it at some point, whether it be back when it first came out or one of those ridiculous Steam sales.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
If Final Fantasy XI goes free to play, I don't know where my life's going to take me then.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
Well, not to change the subject, but there's an interesting rumor I've come across.

29:51.000 --> 29:58.000
They did a survey for the Final Fantasy XI player base about what systems people are playing Final Fantasy XI on.

29:58.000 --> 30:06.000
And people are drawing conclusions from this that Final Fantasy XI is looking to ditch the PlayStation 2 because that's what's holding it back, tech-wise.

30:06.000 --> 30:13.000
If Final Fantasy XI could ditch the PlayStation 2, they could do all new textures, the game could get an overhaul.

30:13.000 --> 30:20.000
That would be very interesting because then Final Fantasy XI could hypothetically look like Final Fantasy XIV but not suck.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
It'd be very interesting.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
Why don't we just get rid of Final Fantasy XIV and just pretend it doesn't exist?

30:25.000 --> 30:32.000
Tell everybody, hey, you know what? I know you bought Final Fantasy XIV. We're just going to make it XI.

30:32.000 --> 30:38.000
We'll call it XIV. We'll just upgrade XI to XIV.

30:38.000 --> 30:47.000
Let me go back to Guild Wars for a minute because I got to say, I am really excited looking at the Guild Wars 2 footage even though it doesn't really look like Guild Wars 1 at all.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
And I know you can kind of start earning stuff for Guild Wars 2 in Guild Wars right now.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
Are you excited about Guild Wars 2 at all?

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
Fuck yes, I am. Oh my god, it looks so awesome. I'm so excited.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Why does it look so good?

31:02.000 --> 31:13.000
Because it's not WoW. Every other fucking MMO that's come out in the past five years, all cheap imitations of WoW, this does not even remotely look like WoW.

31:13.000 --> 31:20.000
They really try to go out of their way in their developer stuff to really say, this isn't like other MMOs.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
We're trying to not approach this like other MMOs. We're not trying to emulate other MMOs.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
But my only issue with that is that's what everybody else has said too and it just ends up being WoW.

31:28.000 --> 31:37.000
But you know what, they're able to back up their claims. If you look at the gameplay footage, if you look at the screen art, all that stuff, you know that it's different from WoW.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
So it's not just another WoW clone.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Is that supposed to be a 2011 release or is that not until next year?

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
They haven't even done beta for it. So it's not going to be out for a while.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Gotcha. Well good, that's one less game I have to buy this year.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
It looks pretty awesome from the stuff I've seen.

31:54.000 --> 32:01.000
I'm way more interested in that than even like Old Republic. Sorry Star Wars fans, but Guild Wars 2 looks awesome.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
Yeah, I could talk for hours about it, but I won't.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Oh, but you should. Why don't you start right now?

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
And then you're just going to cut off my mic.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
Alright. Anyhow, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Nope.

32:14.000 --> 32:22.000
Alright. My gaming week. I finally, after like weeks and weeks, and I know this is old news to a lot of you, but this is why I've been playing.

32:22.000 --> 32:30.000
I played L.A. Noire finally for the first time, which was what I was referring to earlier when I said I was playing a game that felt like playing a movie a little bit.

32:30.000 --> 32:36.000
And yeah, L.A. Noire. Wow. I gotta say though, I like it more than I thought I would.

32:36.000 --> 32:43.000
I'm not usually super into these Grand Theft Auto games and certainly there's components of L.A. Noire that kind of feels like, oh, it's Grand Theft Auto in the 40s.

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
But that's really just like the driving around stuff and a little bit of the combat stuff.

32:48.000 --> 32:55.000
I liked the interrogation and the clue finding and all that stuff, even though I am so fucking terrible at interrogations.

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
I can't believe how much I bombed what is supposed to be like the easiest fucking case in the game.

33:00.000 --> 33:05.000
And I think my biggest issue is I am unable to figure out why there is truth.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
Well, I figured it out, but at the beginning I couldn't figure out why you have truth, doubt, and lie.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Because I was like, isn't doubt and lie like the same thing?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Either they're telling the truth or they're not.

33:14.000 --> 33:21.000
I mean, there's no middle ground, but what it is is that lie means you have the evidence to back it up, that it's a lie.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
And doubt means you just don't believe them.

33:23.000 --> 33:31.000
But, you know, even in the first case where it's so, like their expressions are like over the top, like you can really read them.

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
I was, I got every single question wrong my first time. Like multiple times.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Like while I was trying to figure out what's going on.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
Thankfully the game didn't be all like, you lose, game over.

33:41.000 --> 33:47.000
It just kind of, I just got yelled at repeatedly by the boss and finally I got through it, figured out the right answers.

33:47.000 --> 33:54.000
But, um, I liked the expressions and the faces look really neat.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
And the voice acting is well done too. So, you're laughing over there, Irene.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
Yeah, I mean, the, you know, faces looked neat.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Have you played it at all?

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
I have not played it, but I watched one of our friends play it.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And I think it's a stupid game.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Why do you think it's stupid?

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
It's corny. It's just, I mean like, okay, so you chase after a guy.

34:13.000 --> 34:20.000
All right, fun. And then you like interrogate and it's just, it feels unnatural when you're trying to interrogate them.

34:20.000 --> 34:27.000
And then if you do it wrong, that stupid ass sergeant guy just like is crazy and he yells at you like he's a psycho.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
I don't know. And that just wasn't the point when I tuned out because I didn't care.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
It's just, it's, it's almost like being on a game show because like you find out right away if you fucked up or not.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
Like you hit the button and right away it just fades up. Incorrect. And you hear a little doo doo doo.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
And I'm like, God damn it.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Yeah.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
And then they'll yell at you like the chicks all, get out of my store, you're an asshole.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
I'm like, but you totally looked like you were lying, bitch.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Set your store on fire now.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
See, that's where the game needed more Grand Theft Auto because like, bitch, I'm gonna set this store on fire then.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
But I couldn't do that because you're supposed to be a cop and cops don't set things on fire randomly, you know.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Yeah. Elianore is not Grand Theft Auto.

35:09.000 --> 35:18.000
I listened to Dan play the whole thing cause I was in here and I was like, wow, this is historically accurate given the dialogue.

35:18.000 --> 35:25.000
And then like I saw the ending, I'm not going to spoil, but I was like, what? That's the ending.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
Well, they had to leave it for DLC, I guess. I don't know the ending, but.

35:28.000 --> 35:33.000
I'm not, no, I'm just gonna say it's what? When, when you see it, that's all.

35:33.000 --> 35:41.000
Well, we'll see. I don't know. I have the attention span of a three year old, so I don't know if I'll get that far, but I'll probably at least play it a few more times before I return it back to Loki.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
I've only had it for like two months. What's another month gonna, gonna hurt?

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
It's funny you say that because a three year old was watching me play well last night and she would not stop asking me questions.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Really? What kind of questions is a three year old asking?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I was an ice crown too, which was really boring.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
What kind of questions does a three year old ask about World of Warcraft?

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
Are those bad guys? Yes, they're bad guys. I like bad guys. They're strong.

35:59.000 --> 36:09.000
Yeah, but I have to beat up the bad guys, so I'm stronger than they are. Oh, well you're pretty cool too, but that bad guy's a big bug. Do they eat other bugs?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
You're playing, you're playing Horde, right?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
No. Playing Alliance.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Oh, well then nevermind.

36:15.000 --> 36:23.000
Also, you have to remember, Horde isn't the bad guys. It's just an alternative lifestyle. No, I don't know what you'd call it.

36:23.000 --> 36:31.000
It's the other, it's just the other faction, you know. Either you're a goat person or you're a cow person. It's just whatever.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Space goat, coast to coast.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Exactly. Exactly.

36:35.000 --> 36:47.000
Other games I've played this week besides L.A. Noire. I revisited the Wii a little bit this week because if you were listening to the show a couple weeks ago, I hacked my Wii and I have a drive now that I'm loading all my games to, which I'm, they're my games.

36:47.000 --> 36:55.000
I've been dumping them to the drive just because I can. I don't know, I just thought it would be fun. And now I never have to get up from the couch.

36:55.000 --> 37:03.000
Yeah, it's actually forced me to revisit a lot of old Wii games I haven't played in years, so I'm actually kind of glad I did it.

37:03.000 --> 37:14.000
And these are all games I've talked about on the show years and years ago when I first bought them. But I played Geometry Wars for a little while today, because you know Geometry Wars had the Wii version, but it's really weird because you have to actually point, you don't have two analogs on the Wii, right?

37:14.000 --> 37:26.000
So you have one analog and then you actually point on the screen for your other analog. And the nice thing about it, I don't know, it's a different way to control it. It's kind of cool, you can actually just point at the ships and it's, I don't know.

37:26.000 --> 37:33.000
But I like that the game had all sorts of different maps, all sorts of different types of modes. It's a fun game.

37:33.000 --> 37:45.000
And then I was randomly playing New Super Mario Brothers Wii today. Why? Because I could. And it was, they really just tried to remake Mario 3 with that game, I think.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
As minimal effort as possible.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Well, it's not a bad game, though.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
No, it's not a bad game.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
It's actually a pretty, one of the better games on the Wii.

37:52.000 --> 38:08.000
But see, that's the point. The point is, you don't have to spend a lot of development money to make a game. You could put out, you know, something that's very similar to another game, just change up the levels and then you don't charge as much. I don't know.

38:08.000 --> 38:25.000
So, let's see, what else did I play this week besides revisiting the Wii? Oh, 360! Since that's up and running again, I played Insane Twisted Shadow Planet. Because I was really into that game and then the Xbox got hacked and I was pissed off, so I played a little more of that.

38:25.000 --> 38:33.000
And it's getting to the point where it's getting a lot harder, but I basically have determined that this is like Metroid, but kind of like more of a puzzler. Which is kind of awesome.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
So, yeah, Insane Twisted Shadow Planet. I think you would actually really like it.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
Oh, did you try it, Irene?

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
I've tried it. It's okay. That's the one where the robot flies around and he has to use his different like...

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
The spaceship.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Yes.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Yes, yes, that's it.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Yeah, it's alright.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Yeah? I like it. It's really fun.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Yeah.

38:50.000 --> 39:04.000
So, I'm in the ice world right now, which supposedly the game's only supposed to take like seven or eight hours to beat, but some of it's like really hard. Like, the difficulty really amped up really fast from the ocean level to the snow level, I noticed, is kind of interesting.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I didn't even know there were other levels.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, did you just play the demo?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Yeah, just the...

39:09.000 --> 39:21.000
Yeah, there's more. Like, kind of like how in Metroid you had, you know, the fire area where Ridley was and then like the plant area where, you know, Kraid was. Something similar to that.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
So, not nearly as good, but I mean, yeah. No, I know what you mean.

39:24.000 --> 39:41.000
No, it's not. Like, the thing is Metroid kind of had the characters to kind of stick out and everything in Insane Twisted Shadow Planet kind of just looks like film noir and because it's so vague as to what the story really is, like, it doesn't have that strong character that Nintendo has a lot of their games.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
But the game itself is still worth it. Absolutely.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Yeah, the environment's pretty immersive. I mean...

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Yeah, and the art style's pretty rad.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Yeah.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
It's pretty good.

39:49.000 --> 39:56.000
Alright, so that's going to do it for my gaming week. I think that's enough for that. Let's quickly mention some housekeeping here.

39:56.000 --> 40:05.000
Join us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us on Twitter. Also, you can follow us on Facebook at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
We will be here back again next week with a show, but we will not be here in...

40:10.000 --> 40:21.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I will not be here in two weeks, but I believe they're going to have a show without me. So tune in to hear more on that because I'm going to San Francisco and I'm not going to be here in two weeks.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
So I think they're trying to find a guest host or something.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
I want to go with you.

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
I already bought the tickets. I'm sorry. You're expensive.

40:29.000 --> 40:34.000
Yeah, that's okay. I have to thank you on air, by the way.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Why?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
For my present for kitty sitting.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Oh, and at the Disneyland show when we were gone last time.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
I has a Duffy now. It's a Duffy purse, but he's cute and he lives on my wall.

40:44.000 --> 40:50.000
There you go. Glad you like it. Thank you for house-sitting the cats who chewed up the $50 headphones I own while we were gone.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Well, someone left them on the floor.

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
I didn't, you know, you don't think, oh, I got to make sure that the cord isn't dangling a little bit from my desk.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
Honestly, if I had known, I would have taken care of it.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
I can't expect you to know.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Can you tell me that you've watched that trailer that I just linked you to?

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
No, I haven't. Uh, what is this all about?

41:08.000 --> 41:14.000
This is the brand new trailer for Saints Row the Third. It's highlighting their third gang called the Deckers.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
Oh boy. All right. Let's check this out before we get into the news.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
You're going to like this. You may have to buy Saints Row the Third.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
I'm already thinking I have to buy it.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
I think you should. And this, this is.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
All right. I'm looking at a trailer rated M. Here we go.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
And this makes for a great rate.

41:31.000 --> 41:41.000
Oh my God.

41:41.000 --> 41:47.000
They are dressed up in Tron like gear, like their jackets are all glowing, glowing blue.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Keep watching.

41:48.000 --> 42:07.000
All right.

42:07.000 --> 42:20.000
What? Oh, no. Keep watching. Okay. They're all racing on cars.

42:20.000 --> 42:32.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, please tell me they're going to get on light pipes and shit.

42:32.000 --> 42:46.000
Wow. They're not even like trying to hide the fact what inspires this, are they?

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Dude, they're going to get sued right now.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I can't wait to play this fucking game.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
How is this at all like the other two games?

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
I'm, I'm just confused.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
You don't understand.

42:56.000 --> 43:04.000
Because, because with Saints Row, they've decided to just say, you know what, fuck it. We're not even going to just try to be a real game anymore.

43:04.000 --> 43:10.000
This is all about excess. This game is just excessive. It's unnecessary and excessive.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
Each trailer, they go more over the top than the last one.

43:14.000 --> 43:21.000
And this, I don't know how you're going to get more over the top than going into a virtual world and fighting stuff Tron style.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
It's awesome.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
I want, I want now.

43:26.000 --> 43:32.000
Tiger Claw in our chat room also points out the fact that they're called the Deckards is a reference to Blade Runner.

43:32.000 --> 43:38.000
So it's not just Tron that's inspiring this, although visually it's certainly very, very Tron-esque.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
So yeah, Harrison Ford was Deckard.

43:40.000 --> 43:48.000
So anyhow, here's the thing. I'm almost sold on Saints Row 3, but it's also one of those, you know what, I don't want to buy into trailers.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
Just, I'm going to wait for the game to come out, see the reviews, see Loki's review. Very important.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I know he thinks he's going to love it.

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
I got to hear, look, dude, dude, what I was listening to Bobby's show before we were live tonight, right?

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
As I usually do on the car ride over and Madden came out this past week, which is usually like a huge release.

44:06.000 --> 44:12.000
Apparently Madden has, I mean, I don't really play the Madden games, but I know they're huge and everybody buys them.

44:12.000 --> 44:19.000
And they're very important, very, very high profile games. Probably only second to like a Call of Duty game.

44:19.000 --> 44:28.000
And apparently the menus fucking freeze and shit. Like just basic shit is broken in Madden, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing.

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
There's literally nothing that this game could do to make me not want to buy it.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
I mean, there's nothing. Absolutely nothing.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
And come out and say the next gang is My Little Ponies and I wouldn't fucking care.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
Although that would probably make me want to buy the game even more because it's so ridiculous.

44:45.000 --> 44:51.000
What if you have to play Raiden for the rest of the game? Would you like play it still?

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Yes.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Oh, okay.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I don't even understand, what?

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Wasn't that his name from Metal Gear Solid 2?

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Oh, okay. I see.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Was that his name? Raiden?

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Yes.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Okay. Nevermind.

45:05.000 --> 45:13.000
Alright. BlackWolf is in chat actually and points out deckers are also the term in Shadowrun for the grid hackers.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
So lots of references there.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
That is very true. I've played one.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Yes, I did play Shadowrun.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
Alright, well thank you for derailing the show with that trailer. It's actually very interesting looking.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
Alright, let's actually get into the news we were planning on discussing tonight. 45 minutes into the show.

45:27.000 --> 45:34.000
And we'll start off with almost an immediate follow up to something last week that came up at the end of the show. Right, Loki?

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
Yes, last week right before the end of the show they were doing an announcement.

45:38.000 --> 45:45.000
Square Enix was talking about Dragon Quest X. Or at least they were going to make an announcement about Dragon Quest.

45:45.000 --> 45:50.000
That announcement was Dragon Quest X Online. It is an online RPG.

45:50.000 --> 45:57.000
And it is going to be, I'm not sure if it's still being, it looks like it's still being developed by level 5.

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
And of course they're responsible for Dragon Quest VIII and IX.

46:01.000 --> 46:07.000
The game is coming out on the Wii. Also I guess it's being developed for the Wii U as well.

46:07.000 --> 46:17.000
And I guess they're saying also they're considering the 3DS as some form of character transfers or something like that.

46:17.000 --> 46:24.000
It does of course require an internet connection being that it's an online MMO.

46:24.000 --> 46:32.000
And it's going to require a fee as well. So there's going to be some sort of usage fee for that.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
It's kind of interesting because there's really no MMOs on the Wii.

46:36.000 --> 46:42.000
And considering the Wii is pretty much at the end of its life cycle already that's kind of weird.

46:42.000 --> 46:50.000
Yeah, I got to admit. We were talking about this briefly on the show last week because the press conference is about to start when we ended the show last week.

46:50.000 --> 46:57.000
And so I drive home, I get home, I go in the house and I fire up my reader to look at what news I missed while the show was going on.

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
And there's an announcement about Dragon Quest X and I'm like, oh Dragon Quest X is going to be online? On the Wii?

47:02.000 --> 47:10.000
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Online? Wii? Syntax error? I don't understand. How does this compute? You just divided by zero.

47:10.000 --> 47:23.000
The Monster Hunter game over there was, I believe, had paid online as well. I'm thinking though that this is mainly just going to be a Wii U game.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
But that they're like, well you know what, we're going to make it.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Since we promised it on the Wii.

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
Let's make a version also for the Wii because, you know, we still have a user base for that.

47:33.000 --> 47:42.000
It's like a Zelda-esque type of thing because remember Zelda Twilight Princess was a launch title but they had to make the GameCube version because they had originally announced it for GameCube and it was kind of the same hardware.

47:42.000 --> 47:48.000
Yeah, really more like, oh it was ready for the GameCube but they delayed it so they could put it as a Wii launch title.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
That's exactly what they're doing here with Dragon Quest X.

47:52.000 --> 48:06.000
But that whole MMO thing, they haven't said MMO, right? Because when I was looking at some of the stuff and reading about it, it felt more like White Knight Chronicles to me, which kind of was a single player game that had a huge multiplayer component.

48:06.000 --> 48:15.000
Or like, Phantasy Star Universe. I don't consider that game really an MMO. It's kind of like, I don't know how else to explain it. It's like multiplayer.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
It's Momo-ish.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Yeah, it's Momo-ish but it's not, I don't know.

48:18.000 --> 48:32.000
I guess. So they would probably have an offline component as well. I don't know if it's going to be online only, but when I hear usage fees and requires the internet, that screams MMO to me.

48:32.000 --> 48:42.000
GameGuru in our chatroom says, from the makers of Final Fantasy XIV, from the publishers of Final Fantasy XIV, it is a different studio putting this together, right?

48:42.000 --> 48:47.000
Level 5 had nothing to do with Final Fantasy XIV, or any Final Fantasy game for that matter, that I can think of.

48:47.000 --> 48:55.000
So, no. These are different teams, it's important to say. I get your joke, but hopefully the MMO experience doesn't completely suck.

48:55.000 --> 49:06.000
Or whatever online adventuring experience they come up with, which I'm convinced is going to be more like White Knight Chronicles, which was kind of, like that game's really kind of a cult kind of game.

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
It didn't really break through, but there's definitely a player base playing that game.

49:11.000 --> 49:22.000
But, once again, this also begs one simple question. This game is definitely niche. It is very, very niche.

49:22.000 --> 49:28.000
You're talking about an online game. First off, an online MMO on the Wii. Not a lot of people are going to bite on that.

49:28.000 --> 49:39.000
And, it's an RPG. A Japanese-style RPG on the Wii. That's talk about narrowing the user base down quite a bit.

49:39.000 --> 49:49.000
And yet, no Last Story or Xenoblade or anything like that over here. But, yet, they're going to bring that out.

49:49.000 --> 50:00.000
DDR Dollar Bill in the chatroom says, Explain how you guys define MMORPG. Here's the thing, I mean, obviously it's a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, right?

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
But the reason why Phantasy Star Universe kind of doesn't fall out of that category.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Not Roleplay.

50:04.000 --> 50:11.000
MMORPG. Yes and no. Here's the thing. And I'm not saying it's a bad game. God no.

50:11.000 --> 50:17.000
Phantasy Star Online, we wouldn't have fucking MMOs if it wasn't for that and Ultima Online.

50:17.000 --> 50:26.000
But Phantasy Star Universe or any of those games, it's kind of like you have lobbies where you can interact with people and then you have the game.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
You form your parties in the lobby and then you really go play the game.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
But you have chat. You have voice chat. And that was a big component.

50:33.000 --> 50:39.000
But there's nothing else. There's no game component really in those lobbies outside of shops.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
And playing hockey.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
There's no PVP.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
And playing hockey.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I don't know. That's why...

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
And the giant choo-choo rocket level.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
I don't know.

50:48.000 --> 50:57.000
Well, I think that it better be an MMO because what am I paying online then for? Because the Wii, it's online and it's free.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
Why would I have to pay to play a game I just bought online?

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Because MMOs, you pay to play.

51:02.000 --> 51:09.000
Well, yeah, MMOs you pay to play. But if it's not an MMO, if we're just talking about a game with some 4 player, 16 player online...

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
And White Knight Chronicles doesn't charge.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Yeah.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
And the sequel's actually coming out here, which surprised me.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
Sequel's coming out here and also includes the original on the same disc.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
Yeah, as it did in all the other countries too.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Yeah.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
Interesting.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
So for those that missed the first one. I did play the first one. I didn't play a lot of the...

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
You didn't play a lot last week.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
Oh, did it?

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
Or...

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
I might pick it up.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
It's either last week or this week.

51:29.000 --> 51:37.000
The first one's not bad. It had its challenges. And it's weird because you can't actually do the online component until you've played single player for quite some time.

51:37.000 --> 51:43.000
It's weird. It's a weird game, but I bet it's a lot bigger in Japan than it is here.

51:43.000 --> 51:48.000
And just like Dragon Quest, you know this shit's gonna be crazy in Japan. All these games are.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
Oh yeah. I don't doubt it's gonna do well in Japan, but their user base is different than what it is over here.

51:53.000 --> 52:00.000
Unfortunately, over here, they really wanted to get consoles out, so they got consoles to all these non-gamers because the whole thing was,

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
oh, we're gonna expand our audience to non-gamers.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Yeah, how fucking well did that work out for you guys?

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
A bunch of non-gamer people that aren't buying your games.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Great idea.

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
And then you totally ignored your hardcore gamer user base in the process.

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
Yeah, that's gonna work out really well for you for this next console as well.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
It's just, I don't think it's gonna do very well.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
I mean, just look at all the other niche hardcore games that have been out there.

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
RPGs and, you know, non-RPGs, they just haven't done well.

52:33.000 --> 52:39.000
And I understand this is gonna be published probably by, I don't know if it's Square Enix, I'm guessing Nintendo,

52:39.000 --> 52:44.000
because they did the last Dragon Quest game and Dragon Quest Monsters 2 and stuff like that.

52:44.000 --> 52:49.000
So if it's published by Nintendo, I mean, there'll be some more marketing behind that,

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
but it's gonna be tough, especially convincing people.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
First off, I don't know, it'll be tough.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
I just need to really see more of the game before I can really make a call.

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
I gotta play the game, see some reviews, see some trailers that aren't just cut scenes.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Oh, you skeptic.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
No, I mean, I just love Dragon Quest VIII.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
Oh my god, that game was so fucking good on the PlayStation, but, you know, I just...

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
We'll see.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Again, if it's worth the pain.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
But it sounds like there's gonna be still at least a full single-player game,

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
and that part I kinda like, at least.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
I mean, Phantasy Star Universe is the same way.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Yeah, if it's got that, then that's fine.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
Then it's worth a purchase, because then you don't have to play the online portion of it.

53:30.000 --> 53:36.000
And if they're gonna go the whole Phantasy Star online route, then that's fine.

53:36.000 --> 53:43.000
But it's just if they're going just an MMO route, that's gonna be a difficult sell.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
Alright, well, let's see if this is going to be a difficult sell to people.

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
It's basically been confirmed by Nintendo that it is true.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
Some of the rumors that were rumbling last week and the week before is playing out.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
And you can thank Famitsu Magazine for leaking an earlier picture of this.

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
It is a 3DS circle pad attachment.

54:03.000 --> 54:11.000
The 3DS will plug into this kind of, it looks like a docking bay sort of thing that has, yes, another analog stick on the right-hand side.

54:11.000 --> 54:18.000
Along with this announcement came an announcement that they are making Monster Hunter tri-G on the 3DS,

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
which, you know, requires a second analog controller just the way the game is.

54:22.000 --> 54:28.000
So now it's kind of confusing is, did they do this circle attachment just to get the Monster Hunter game,

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
or is this the future of the 3DS right here?

54:31.000 --> 54:38.000
And so, you know, a lot of early adopters of the system, now, at least I can speak myself, now I'm getting a little pissed.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
Like, I wasn't pissed when they cut the price.

54:41.000 --> 54:48.000
I especially wasn't pissed when they said, we're gonna cut the price and to help ease the pain, we're gonna throw you 20 free virtual console games.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
Cool, fine, I'm fine.

54:49.000 --> 54:58.000
But now that my original 3DS may be just kind of now irrelevant and I'm gonna have to buy this extra attachment for it,

54:58.000 --> 55:02.000
if I have to buy, I mean, I don't know if I would play a Monster Hunter game,

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
but if this ends up being the norm, which I worry it could be?

55:06.000 --> 55:11.000
They're, they're obviously, I mean, if Nintendo's making a peripheral for this game,

55:11.000 --> 55:16.000
and I know Monster Hunter's gonna be big in Japan, it's if it even comes out over here,

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
if they're making a peripheral for this, you better damn well believe that it's gonna be used for something other than just one game.

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
I mean, why even bother if it's gonna be for just one game?

55:25.000 --> 55:31.000
And yeah, as you said, the cost thing, you didn't give me free games because you dropped the price of the system,

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
you know what, you didn't even have to do that, because I understand the price is gonna drop,

55:35.000 --> 55:40.000
yeah, it was a little bit sooner than I had thought, but whatever, you know what, that's so bad, too well.

55:40.000 --> 55:45.000
Whatever, so I bought the system back in March, I had it a few months with no games,

55:45.000 --> 55:50.000
and you know, you dropped it and it gave me some free virtual console games, which I've not played.

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
And, you know, that's fine, but this is gonna split your user base in half now.

55:55.000 --> 56:01.000
Now, this is great, because now everyone thinks that the system is gonna be redesigned, whether it is or not,

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
and all the people that are thinking about, hey, you know, I really need to pick up a 3DS this holiday

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
to pick up some, you know, Mario and Mario Kart games and stuff like that,

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
and whatever else they have coming for the 3DS, people are gonna wait.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
It's gonna be interesting to see what Nintendo says to this press conference,

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
because I'm looking at our chatroom, of course, it's lighting up on this story, chat.orangelandradio.com,

56:21.000 --> 56:27.000
if you want to join us live. Zether in chat says, as of now, that add-on is only for Monster Hunter tri-G.

56:27.000 --> 56:32.000
And I'm kind of going, okay, yeah, as of now, but there's certainly that skeptic in me that's saying,

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
but now that that's out there, who else might use it?

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
Now, granted, just because the peripheral exists doesn't mean everybody's gonna use it,

56:39.000 --> 56:45.000
like I think of, okay, that Metroid pinball game had that rumble pack in the DS, remember that thing?

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
That was a real flash in the pan, right? And I don't think any other games really used it.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Yeah, there's a bunch of games that used it.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
Were there? Huh, I thought there were like one or two.

56:54.000 --> 56:59.000
Not a lot, but that thing right there, though, that's not necessary to play the game.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
Rumble, eh, whatever, so my system doesn't rumble. That's not a big deal.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
None of them do nowadays anyways.

57:05.000 --> 57:11.000
But a second analog stick is kind of important. That's like saying, oh, you know, we added some buttons.

57:11.000 --> 57:16.000
In fact, that does add a couple shoulder buttons to the thing as well, and a trigger, I think.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
So that's a big deal, because now you have dual analogs,

57:20.000 --> 57:25.000
so you could do first-person shooters on that system quite well now.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
I do want to point out it is not only adding a second analog stick. I haven't mentioned this.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
There's also going to be shoulder buttons on it.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
And what's also interesting that some have pointed out,

57:35.000 --> 57:42.000
this little docking bay now will make your 3DS match the configuration of a Wii U controller.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
Not saying that it can serve as a replacement for a Wii U controller yet,

57:46.000 --> 57:53.000
but some folks are going, isn't that interesting that now it matches the configuration of a Wii U controller?

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
And could it be all this call about, gee, what do you mean the system's only going to come with one Wii U controller

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
and we're not going to buy a second controller separately?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Could this be the path we're going down?

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
Yep. That's exactly what they're doing.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
Because you know when that controller first came out,

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
listen to the episodes of OLR leading up to the reveal of the Wii U,

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
because it's very interesting, because we were theorizing and theorizing,

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
and then all of a sudden it just kind of dawned on us that, duh,

58:22.000 --> 58:28.000
everything we have heard about this was clearly just the Wii U controller is a freaking DS without the top screen.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
That's what the Wii U controller is. And a few more buttons.

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
Well, here's your few more buttons now. It's very interesting,

58:35.000 --> 58:40.000
and this Nintendo conference that's coming up, what, tomorrow?

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Going to be very interesting.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
So, I just can't wait to hear their rational-

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
I just- I want to see if they only announce the Monster Hunter thing for this,

58:51.000 --> 58:57.000
or if they say a new Pokemon game, and the Pokemon game's going to use two analog sticks too,

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
because then it's over, all the games are using it.

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
It's not just one game. I mean, come on, it's a peripheral that, you know,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
I think a lot of developers would be like,

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
hey, that's awesome, now we don't have to do some crazy control scheme with the touch screen or whatever.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
I mean, it would make a lot of games easy to port over.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Especially stuff that they're going to be doing on the Vita,

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
and then porting over to the 3DS and stuff like that, it would make it a lot easier.

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
But, at the same time, you should have fucking thought of this when you're designing your system.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Hey, I don't know, let's see, there's the PSP.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
What was the number one bitch about the PSP?

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
It doesn't have a fucking second analog stick.

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
What'd you think, hey, you know what, maybe people want a second analog stick.

59:37.000 --> 59:43.000
Huh, could that be possibly what people want, since they're saying I want a second analog stick.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
Nah, that's not what they want, they just want one analog stick.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
That's what we're going to do, we're just going to leave them with just one analog stick.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
Oh damn, you know, a big game comes out that needs a second analog stick.

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
Ah, crap, we better make another adjustment to this.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Yeah, I'd be pissed even if it isn't an accessory or whatever.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Not only does it make it, you know, how the fuck am I supposed to carry that around with me now?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
It's not going to fucking fit in my pocket.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Now, again, we have to really wait until after Nintendo makes the official announcement,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
because I think it's still, even though we have the picture and everything,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
it's still too early to say what the point of this is.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Is this a Monster Hunter add-on or is this, we don't know.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
But we're all looking at it going, gosh, it makes your 3DS look like a Wii U controller,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
yeah, a lot of people want to have that second analog stick,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
we've heard rumors about a 3DS redesign anyway,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
it would all add up, this is probably happening.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I kind of akin this to, and I see some folks in chat are talking about,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
well not every peripheral goes on forever, like the e-reader, printer and so forth,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
and I go, and none of these are ever required, but then I go,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
but what about the Wii Plus motion thing?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Wii Motion Plus.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Wii Motion Plus didn't come out until later,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
and now it's like if you want to play the new Zelda game, you have to have it.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
So it would not be unheard of for Nintendo to require this in the future.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
This is more along the lines of Wii Motion Plus than it is the e-reader.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
E-reader, those are all gimmicky things that weren't necessary, like the rumble pack.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
That's not necessary to play a DS game, it was just a gimmicky thing.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
The e-reader was actually a really kind of cool idea, I gotta say.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
It was a cool idea, but it was still a gimmick.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
You could have done something else, you know, to...

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
How awesome was it to have an old school NES game on five cards in your pocket?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
That was kind of cool, I'm sorry.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Yeah, it's pretty cool, but at the same time though, this is another analog stick.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.000
This is adding another joystick. This is very significant.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And it's a few extra buttons on there, which by the way,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
it's kind of interesting now that I think of it,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
it's probably gonna use that IR port that's on the back of that fucking 3DS

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
that everyone's like, what the hell's this IR port for?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Great.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
But, it's just...

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Alright.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I mean, we've got more stories to talk about, you know, the 3DS and...

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Well, let me bring some of these up real quick.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
3DS, obviously the price cut happened and a lot of you are very happy about it.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
How many of you are happy about it?

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Over 260% are buying this now than were before.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000
3DS sold 185,000 units between the price cut and the month's end.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
That's a 260% increase over that same time period in July.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
So it does mean that this has motivated sales a little more

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
and this is a trend that's gonna continue through Christmas, guaranteed.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I still think, especially now that the Vita's not around this Christmas,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
this thing's gonna sell like crazy over the holidays.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Despite all this other crap we're talking about.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Soccer moms don't know about... Soccer moms are not reading Famitsu magazine in Japan.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I honestly think that the whole thing with the 3DS was really very carefully planned.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
They knew they didn't have a good thing out quite yet

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
but at least at the higher price anyway with the intention of dropping the price

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
because they knew it would...

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I mean, sales would happen after a price drop.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I don't think so.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I kinda actually disagree because I think Nintendo saw the reception at E3

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and was like, holy shit, we've struck gold with this thing.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
We gotta get it out now.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And they put it out in some ways too soon.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
But where I will hit is that I think the strategy all along was a build up to Christmas.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I think they released it at the end of the fiscal year to pad the low sales a wee

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
and then it's gonna just...

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
The price drop, on the other hand, I don't think that was planned.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
No, because if they were planning on doing...

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Well, no one plans on dropping the price of that.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I mean, they've gotta be selling at a loss now.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000
And if they weren't selling at a loss and they had that much of a margin in there,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
they could have fit a second fuckin' analog stick in there.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I mean, an analog stick doesn't cost hardly anything.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
It's maybe $10 to put in that system.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I doubt it's even $10.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I've bought replacements for my PSP.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
The 3DS production cost is $101 per unit.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Wow.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So, including overhead...

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
They're probably still pulling a profit on it.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So they could have charged $10 extra dollars in what they're charging now

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and added a second analog stick all along.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And you know what?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Hey, guess what, Nintendo?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
It's a good thing to have things on your system,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
like say a second analog stick that,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
yeah, you know what, you may not have a use for it right now,

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
but publishers would probably want that.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You know, it makes development of games a little bit easier.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
There's some funky right analog stick using the touch screen.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I find this fascinating, one other little thing about the DS family,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
because this is about DSi XL, which is still out, still selling,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
at the same price as the 3DS.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I was at Fry's today, and Salacious Pop really wants a DSi XL,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
because, you know, he has a lot of DS games and he just kind of wants one.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I'm not going to question if somebody wants something.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
You know, and has been talking about it,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
but it's the same price as the 3DS right now, which I find fascinating.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
And it's not dead.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
It's far from it.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000
They've just announced that on September 18th there will be a metallic rose DSi XL.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
It's fucking pink.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
It's a fucking pink DSi, and it's coming out on September 18th.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
You know what, I kind of want it.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000
In the same way that I wanted my pink advance that I have the afterburner in,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I kind of want this now.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I mean, you know, whatever.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
The DSi XL, you know, the screens are really big, it's kind of nice, whatever,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
but it is weird that it's the same price as the 3DS.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
That's a little weird to me.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
DS Lite, by the way, are still on shelves.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
There's a really pretty blue one.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
99 bucks for DS Lite.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
That's interesting to me.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Huh, all right.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I don't get empty.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
You know what, these people that buy this pink system that's coming out,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
the same price as the 3DS,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
you deserve all those high-priced games and shit.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
All right, well, we're going to revisit all of this again next week

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
because the Nintendo press conference is happening in a couple days,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
and who knows what curveballs are going to come out of that.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
There could be that.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I mean, if a Pokémon game is announced, good lord, it's...

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
They already have a Pokémon game.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
What Pokémon game would...

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Not 3D.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I'm sorry, yes, they have a Pokémon, but it's a Pokémon...

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
It's like Pokémon Snap.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Pokémon Snap is not really a Pokémon game, you know what I mean?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Like, they need a Pokémon magenta, and Pokémon...

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
There's no Pokémon game that's going to need a second analog stick.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Maybe you just haven't thought of it yet.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
A Pokémon first-person shooter.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
That would be all sorts of lame.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
No, that would be awesome, are you kidding?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
No, it would be stupid.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Pokémon first-person shooter, wasn't that pretty much Pokémon Snap?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Pretty much.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Because you're shooting from a first-person perspective.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Oh, get out.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
You know what, no, I agree.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It was a first-person shooter.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
You just shot photos of them and not, you know,

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
shooting them dead with bullets into their, you know, cute little fuzzy heads.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I'm just saying Goldeneye would have been that much better

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
if it was Pikachu killing people.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Just saying.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Dark Sakura.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
How about Crytek?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Fail.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Um, one of their, I guess, former employees decided

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
that they were going to go off on Tumblr.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
There's an anonymous account which I took the liberty

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
of reblogging everything on our Tumblr.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Hint, hint, hint.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Orangelangeradio.tumblr.com.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And, basically, he's listing this whole, just crazy line of stuff

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
that, you know, they've done that's illegal.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Going over this, he said, I'm going to read a little bit.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
From the outside, Crytek produces some of the most graphically pleasing games around.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Those being Far Cry, Crysis, Crysis, Warhead, and Crysis 2.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Four games in ten years.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000
The work of the individuals should be proud of what they've done.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
But they've basically said that there's a bullying mentality given at the CEO levels.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Where they're delivered lines like, you should be proud to work for Crytek,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
yet demanding six months of crunch time due to project management failures.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
This caused certain members of staff to suffer both in medical and personal ways.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And he's listing, alright, this polluted the work atmosphere that resulted in the resignation

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
and or unlawful firing of global talent manager, global head of resourceful humans,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
lead game designer, lead community manager, community manager, lead researcher,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.000
storyboard and concept artist, and a whole list of developers and designers.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And, so basically, the article, you know, he's just there on Tumblr pretty much blasting them.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I mean, nothing really specifically listed, just said that a lot of senior staff was made redundant

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.000
and that employees were, quote, allowed to work longer hours and weekend days.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Which, again, Crytek's a German developer in violation of German law.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Now, the co-founder, Avni Yearly, said, and he spoke with Develop about these practices

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and said that they were misleading accusations and, quote,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
is very distressing for us to think that an individual thinks we've been treating them unfairly.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.000
It's very disappointing. So, I actually found a rebuttal on the same Tumblr.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And he goes on saying, as previously mentioned, we do not aim to mislead or give erroneous opinions

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
as this would ultimately decrease the strength on which the blog was first created.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And it is nothing but bring into doubt the levels of truth featured within.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.000
So, he said, if German labor codes were being met and strictly adhered to,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:44.000
there would be no need for the successful court cases against Crytek GmbH in which a company lawyer was present.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Crytek, if you can provide proof that no one has ever successfully claimed compensation due to an illegal firing,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
then please do so. You cannot.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And, so basically, just going on. You can read this all if you want to.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I've linked them both on our Tumblr. But it's, like, it really goes long.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And he's talking, just, this is clearly somebody who was there.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It's one of those cases where I think you go, okay, you know, you read this and you go,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
well, another person complaining about the development industry, what a shock.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:22.000
It's probably true. But then you look at it and you go, well, he probably does have a lot of bitterness issues.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Obviously, something happened there.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
None of this reads like anyone bitter.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I just, I still think the answer's probably in the middle somewhere.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
It's probably, you know, and I think I just said this two weeks ago on the show in a very similar story.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.000
There's your side of the story, my side of the story, and the truth somewhere in the middle.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
It's probably what's happening here, too.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Well, there's another line on here, though, that I think is a very good point.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Enforcing weekend work and expecting them to come in are two different things.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
As an employee, you know that if you aren't showing the drive and ambition to become a team player,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
your direct line manager may take a negative stance on your progression in the company.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000
So basically, it's talking about the impact it has on home life, on employee well-being,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
which is actually something that I think is a big problem here in the U.S., to be perfectly honest.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
But I don't, I really don't read any bitterness into any of this.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000
This is someone who loved his job or her job and was proud of the work that they did

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:25.000
and found that the entire, just from reading the whole thing, found that the work environment is what soured it.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
They're very proud of their work, very proud of what they did, but it was all environmental.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Well, it'll be interesting to see if this anonymous person is forced to reveal themselves later on or what happens.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I just want to end it with the last line.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:45.000
We make and made great games, and we just want to see the atmosphere and blatant disregard for employee morale improve.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
All right.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
So, more power to you. Good luck.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Let's move on.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:57.000
All right. So, we talked a little bit about Ubisoft and their different DRM that they're going to have for upcoming games.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:07.000
One of the first ones that was going to take place on console was this new Uplay Passport thing that they were doing with Driver San Francisco.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Problem was, it didn't quite go as planned.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Driver San Francisco on Xbox 360 was supposed to include a Uplay Passport code required to access multiplayer beyond a 48 hour trial period.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.000
However, they forgot to put the codes in many of the copies that went out.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Brilliant work.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Yes. So, what ended up happening, and this is only really in North America.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.000
What ended up happening, though, is the people that bought it, you can actually get the Passport for free.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
You just either sign in and there's two options.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:56.000
There's one to start my two day free trial, which will not expire now, or select Uplay Passport Purchase, which will be provided at no charge.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:05.000
So, if you wanted to right now, you could purchase that game for, you know, used or whatever and still get online for free.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Because they fucked up.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
So basically the whole thing just went out the window.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Yes, on the Xbox 360 at least. Still going on the Playstation 3, because they didn't forget that one.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
But, Xbox 360 at least, they forgot.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Well, that's nice and fair.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.000
And, surprisingly, the game got pretty good reviews. I didn't think it would be that well, but it did alright.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Also, From Dust on PC had that wonderful online, you have to be always online in order to play the game.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Well, now they have a patch that removes that DRM.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
So, the title can be played in offline mode as well now.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I guess a follow up to that had come up a couple weeks ago.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I know that some people were pissed that an extra layer of DRM was added to the Steam version.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Not cool.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Alright, well, moving on to a story about Xbox and some bans going on on Xbox Live.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Apparently, Xbox has actually put out a statement this week that they did ban quite a few users this week.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
And it was a result of, theft was the keyword they used.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:23.000
The company, quote, discovered users who were illegitimately accessed Xbox Live Marketplace downloadable content.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000
This access was intentional and not accidental, constituting a blatant violation of the terms of use for the service.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
But they won't give any more specifics about what's going on.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I guess it's known around the internet that there are some ways that you can steal the stuff and Microsoft is finally clamped down on it.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000
It's not entirely stealing, but yeah, there is a way.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
What do you mean it's not entirely stealing?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:58.000
It has to do with different profiles. People basically importing a profile over downloading that content and then, you know, it's basically recovering a profile.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Oh, it's like content sharing.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Yes.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I wonder if somebody did that when my account was hacked.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Because you know I have a lot of games.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Yeah.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
So I wonder if they did that.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Basically, it's recovering a profile. So you have like people made certain profiles, say they bought like Grand Theft Auto as a games on demand thing.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And so what happens is you recover that profile and you can put it on your system and you can play offline, you know, without that profile and you know, because it's on your system.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
At least I think that's how we're never tried it.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I want to say that there's got to be some type of hack that goes there because like for instance, when my one 360 red ringed and I had to get another, I put on the hard drive with all my old games on it.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And if I wasn't connected to the internet, my game would show up as a demo at first, but then it would turn into the real game after I was like signed in.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
So I think something happens there where it's just the demo version, but when Xbox Live talks to it.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
So I'm not sure how they're pulling that off. There's got to be something a little shady there.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:08.000
I was hoping at first that this meant they caught the people that were stealing all the people's money, but I guess it doesn't sound like that.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And Microsoft still has not said anything about that.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:18.000
No, they, in fact, there's a forum I browse all the time that had a section where they were swapping games like that and it's gone.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000
That whole forum section is no longer, which I'm guessing they just banned everybody.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Nice.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Yeah.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Alright, so this is one of those cases where you don't want to share.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Maginomicon in our chat says, I wonder if that also applies to the free Fable 2 glitch that happened a few months ago.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
I seem to remember that. I don't think so.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
No.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000
No, because that was a legitimate mistake on Microsoft's part that a lot of people went in and just took advantage of.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
But at the end of the day, that was Microsoft's fault for leaving that switch open.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
People weren't like hacking their consoles or going around to get it.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
They had put it up on the marketplace for free.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
It was kind of their own damn fault.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
They were mad, but, you know, be mad at whoever did that.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Don't be mad at the people who took advantage of it.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
So, alright.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Alright, moving on.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Dark Soccer, why don't you move on to the next story for us?

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Yeah.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Okay, the next story actually has to do with Pinball FX.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
This is the developer says that Microsoft is pretty okay in their book.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Basically, it's kind of putting down on team meat for what they said, putting down Microsoft.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And there's a quote on here from Millkirk, who is then studio's vice president of marketing.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
It says, they totally have the right to talk about it.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
It's terrible they had a bad experience like that, but where we're coming from, when is enough enough?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Let it go already.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.000
So basically, they're just like, why are you trying to put them down?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:59.000
We're not trying to discredit that you've had a bad time from this, but that it's time to get over it, time to move on.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And so they're apparently sniping back and forth like children.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
It was interesting to read.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I don't know if the tweets are still up, but they're archived around on the internet somewhere, I'm sure.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And it was really one of those cases where I read it and I went, really? Like people don't think more about the fact that everybody is watching these two companies fight?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
It wasn't very flattering for either one, I think.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
But there was obviously a lot of very, it's like anybody who fights on Twitter or on Facebook or whatever.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000
It's just emotions are running high, so you don't think before you click post and then later you sort of regret it.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:42.000
But it was nice to see that it all ended with a, you know, how about a super meat boy skin for pinball or whatever they had said at the end that they kissed, made up, cuddled.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Well, yeah, well, it's even says on here that, you know, they're like good for them, they had a good time, you know, that's great for them.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Right.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I mean, that's what the meat boy people said.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Mm hmm.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
So, I mean, it's working out in the end.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
But you should have seen the tweets because the tweets were the equivalent of fuck you, you fucking fuck.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Like, that's really how they read to me.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Oh, like I said, children.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Yeah.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
So, but it's like someone smacked them on the hand and said, now make nice.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Well, those are, well, this is the internet, you guys look dumb right now.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Well, and they're two great games too.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Yeah.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I love both those games, pinball FX2 and meat boys.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
It was kind of sad.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
It's like watching your friends fight and you're just sitting there helpless.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
You can't do anything about it.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
You know what I mean?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I know how that feels.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I know.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
There you go.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Alright, let's move on.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Travel the world and check out some release dates.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
What is coming out to a console near you?

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Loki, let's start in the US.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
The US is actually, well, it's still continuing on with quite a few games coming out.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Starting on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, we have NHL 12 coming from EA.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Also this week, was it from Twisted Pixel?

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
The Gun Stringer for Kinect.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000
And of course you get, was it Fruit Ninja Kinect in there as well.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So if you're interested in those games, that's this week.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
White Knight Chronicles 2 is coming out this week as well.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
That also includes the first game that's on Playstation 3.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Camping Mama, Outdoors Adventure on Nintendo DS.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Yes, she is still making games about different things other than cooking.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
New Cooking Mama coming out later this year.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Thor, God of Thunder on the 3DS.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
It was basically the same version as the ones back in May, but now for the 3DS.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Deck of Sports Extreme coming out for the 3DS.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Bit.Trip Saga, which is the collection of all the Bit.Trip games.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
That's on the 3DS this week as well.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Puzzler Mind Gym on the 3DS.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Bit.Trip Complete, which is on the Wii, and that also includes the soundtrack for the game as well.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Call of Juarez the Cartel on PC.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Red Orchestra 2, Heroes of Stalingrad on PC.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Nicktoons MLB, that's on the Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000
The God of War Origins collection on PS3 coming out this week.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Pooka Power Up, that's on Nintendo DS.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Aren't Pookas the little guys in Dig Dug?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Oh, no.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Oh, Pooka P-U-C-C, I was thinking P-O-O-K-A.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Is it P-U-C-C-A?

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Yeah.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
That's like the candy.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Well, when I heard it, I thought Dig Dug.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Silly English language.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Emily the Strange Strangress on the Nintendo DS.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
There's some Dual Packs coming out for the PSP.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I don't know what I'm aware of here.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Mega Man Dual Pack, I believe that's Mega Man Power Up Legends and Mega Man...

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
There is a Mega Man X game as well.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
That's on PSP.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Then Monster Hunter Freedom Dual Pack, that's the two Monster Hunter Freedom games that were out on the PSP over here.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.000
And that is it.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000
On the Xbox 360 on September 15th, Dunamis 15 is coming out.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:21.000
That is not a series I recognize over here, but it is an adventure game that's coming out on the 15th.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I don't think it's actually the 15th game in a series, but you do get bikini-clad anime girls as part of it.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Actually, she's wearing a little bra.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
They're kind of cute.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I don't know what type of game this is.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Probably another type of sim game, but it looks like it has these mystery elements.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
I need to stop trying to guess what these games are, because I'm probably getting it horrifically wrong.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
But it is kind of fun to guess.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Otherwise, though, probably not a game we're going to get over here.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
So that's really it on the 360 this week.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Going to the PlayStation 3, they're getting that same game, and that's really it on the PlayStation 3.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
There's some more stuff coming next week, just so you guys know.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:02.000
And then going to the handhelds real quick.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Trying to pull up the PSP releases here.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
God Eater Burst gets a price reduction.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Otherwise, as far as new games go, there's Gekka, Rioran, Romance comes out from Idea Factory this week.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And this game, it looks like it could be based off an anime.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
I'm not sure.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
I just know one of these screenshots says,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Dessert, Prohibited Fruits Scenario.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:32.000
So apparently, there's no no fruits in this game.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I don't really know how else to say that.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Prohibited Fruits Scenario is an awesome band name.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Right?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And on the 3DS this week, nothing.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Nothing on the 3DS.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
But next week, Frogger, Loki's favorite.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
So that's it.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Next week is going to pick up a little more in Japan.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
But for right now, really nothing else.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Dark Sakura!

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Well, in other news, this is of course coming out in the UK.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.000
On the 13th, we have Hard Reset and Red Orchestra, Heroes of Stalingrad.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And on the 14th, we have From Dust, Radiant Silvergun for Xbox Live Arcade, Renegade Ops, TrackMania 2.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
And on the 15th, Moto Heroes.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Alrighty.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Then we got the classic game of the week.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
But first, Loki.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Yes.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Infinity Ward is going to get their day in court next year in May on the 7th.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:33.000
This is, of course, the whole trial where they were suing Activision for royalties unpaid.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000
They're seeking $125 million in unpaid royalties from the sales of Modern Warfare 2.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.000
And also wish to reclaim their contractual rights to the Modern Warfare brand.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Can you imagine if they win that?

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
That's going to be some interesting shit right there.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I don't think they're going to.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I'm excited one of these is finally going to court.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Like, we always hear settle, settle, settle, settle, settle.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
But like now, oh man, Michael Jackson popcorn eating gift.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
You know which one I'm talking about, right?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
You've seen that animated file.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
That's going to be me while this thing's in the courtroom.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Because even though this isn't a series I'm a big huge fan of, I'm, I'm, I'm excited to see somebody do battle with Activision.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
It's going to be interesting.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Any bets?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I don't think there's bets on the court.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I don't think they're going to get.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
They probably will get their royalties.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I don't know if they're going to get the Modern Warfare 2 stuff.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
And even if they did, they just renamed the damn franchise.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Right.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I don't think they're going to get the same thing though.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Call of Heroes.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
No, they'll still be Call of Duty.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
It'll just be, you know.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Modernized Warness or something.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Warfare Modern.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Exactly.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Well, Sony created a new job this week.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:53.000
They hired a chief information security officer, which probably makes sense considering, oh, you know, they had that huge information breach earlier this year when their system got hacked.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Well, they're not fucking around with who they've hired for the position.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
They have hired a former US Homeland Security official.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000
It's Phillip Teitinger is the new chief information security officer at PlayStation Network.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
No word as to exactly what that person does.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000
However, what I'm assuming is that he's going to make sure that system never gets hacked again.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Because if it does get hacked again, they'll probably hire someone new instead.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
So, yep.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Apparently, he's not just that, but he's also going to be a senior vice president.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.000
So, I imagine he'll have a say in some of the higher level goings ons of the companies.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000
He will be reporting to an executive VP in the company.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And, of course, Sony is making no really hold backs saying that they are confirming that it's because of the PSN breach saying, quote, we are looking to bolster our network security even further.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
So, they are going to make sure that doesn't happen again.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Because if it does happen again, it's going to be really, really bad for everybody.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Alright, let's go back to a simpler time when the systems weren't being hacked.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And our credit card information wasn't saved on the console.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Remember when we had consoles and we didn't have to put our credit cards right on?

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Remember when your consoles didn't have the memory capacity to save anything?

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Exactly.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Well, I think this week's classic game did have a memory capacity of some sort.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
But not on the console.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
It was about 16 blocks big. That was it.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Yeah.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
So, let's take a trip down memory lane with a segment we always do.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
The classic game of the week.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the gaming vault head first and pull out a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be re-experiencing this game all over again.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I got to say, this week is kind of one of those weeks where you go, really? Dark Soccer has been doing this for about 150 weeks and she never did this game?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Kind of on purpose, but this morning's conversation over breakfast really inspired.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
So, what is the classic game of the week that surprisingly has never come up before?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
It's Final Fantasy VII.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Final Fantasy VII came out, well, it started development in 1994 and it was supposed to be on the SNES and then to the Nintendo 64.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:14.000
But when PlayStation came out, they hopped right on it because the Nintendo 64 couldn't handle the storage.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:21.000
It was designed and produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi and the music was by Uematsu, which we all know.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000
But this is the first one that Yoshitaka Amano didn't do the character designs for.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
It was done by Tetsuya Nomura.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000
So, this is one of my favorite games of all time for the record, I would say.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:43.000
So basically, you're this emo boy named Cloud with his hair in his face and he goes around being pissed off and not so talkative.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:51.000
And he runs into this whole bag named Aerith and this really cute girl named Tifa, who's really sweet and nice.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:58.000
And then kind of a vampire-y dude named Vincent who you find in a coffin.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Well, my team freaking had Vincent all the damn time.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
And Yuffie? Yuffie was fun and she had the Conformer?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Can I for real say the first time I played through this game, I never got Vincent.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.000
I didn't even know he was in the game because the internet wasn't really around the back then.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
I mean, it was, but nobody used it like they do now.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:26.000
You know, and it's, I didn't have Vincent and I had Aerith in my party as one of my main people that I would constantly use.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
So let's just say I wasn't happy by the time this two rolled around.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I was legit, like I wasn't sad, I was fucking mad.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I have my save file still where she dies.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Spoiler, she gets ganked by Sephiroth. Ew.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I mean, a lot of people were pissed off and sad.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Look at Aerith. She's a man stealing hoe bag.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Aerith dies is kind of like the video game equivalent of Darth Vader as Luke's father.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
We all fucking know.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Yeah, but at any rate, you know, it's one of my favorite games.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
I bred chocobos like you would not believe.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Yeah, you can breed chocobos and you race them and if you get the black chocobo, it can run over like the, over the mountains.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:15.000
You can get another one that runs over the oceans and then you can get the gold chocobo that runs over everything and then you get the airship.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And there's, you know, all the little drama, the little side stories that end up like, especially with Vincent.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:29.000
You know, the whole Lucretia thing being Aerith's mom, Sephiroth's mom and a bunch of crap.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000
But this game has some of my favorite music in it too, Rob. You should totally play.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Sure, we'll go back from the battle sound there and check out, let's see, you marked this as your favorite song.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
This is my favorite in the game.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Just a little bit of it.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
This is the first Jenova battle theme.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
This is like my favorite music in the whole damn game.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
And then my second favorite is actually more Jenova music.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
The one that basically takes the battle theme and kind of redoes it.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
If you don't mind.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Sure, I'll go to that one too.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Let's see.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
And then I'll keep going with.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Here we go, here's a clip.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:14.000
It takes it so minimalist and then just makes it super dramatic.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Anyway, so you've got all these other characters.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
You've got Barret who cusses.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And Sid who has the best line in the whole game.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Is sit down in your chair and drink your goddamn tea.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Which ended up being quoted in like AOL chats for years and years and years.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And of course there's Red13 who is a kind of a lion-y looking guy.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
And CatShe which for the record that is how it's pronounced.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Because it's Celtic.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
It's not Cait Sith, it's CatShe.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Just thought I'd let you know.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I'm muddying the whole internet now.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
I love Cait Sith, what are you talking about?

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Who ends up being like a Tarte controlling the body and everything.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And of course there's Sephiroth because Sephiroth is what you got.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
And by the way the story still makes no fucking sense to this day.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Yes it does.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Okay, because basically it's like the whole Shinra, the big corporation in charge.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Is sucking the life dry out of the planet.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
And they're using the energy to do genetic experiments.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
And they find this alien thing that lands.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
And they're using that in their experiments too.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Hence Sephiroth.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Who's fucking crazy go nuts.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
So anyway.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
He uh.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
He decides he's gonna do what Jenova came to do.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And that's destroy every fucking thing.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And Aerith's like uh uh bitch.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Even though you know she's a hoebag.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
What?

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
I got corrected by my husband.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Danny came in and said sit your ass down in that chair and drink your god damn tea.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Yes.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Um.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Which by the way I did do a little bit of a double take.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
The first time I was playing through this game and the game said shit.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I was like they can do that in games now.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Apparently.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Welcome to the Playstation.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Right.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Um so at any rate.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
For a little bit more in the development side of that.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Uh.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Basically there are a lot of people involved in this.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
This is a really big deal.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Um.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
It uh was designed on Power Animator and Soft Image 3D.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Which is early 3D.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Ooh.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
This is before my eye kids.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
You know before you could just download 3D software.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
You know.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
For fun.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
And uh.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
But they.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
The story was pretty much.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Um.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Pretty much what they had in mind for the Famicom.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000
But they were able to develop it a lot more and bring the 3D in.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Um.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
They also included um previews of other games.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Um.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Basically the demo disc was a pack in with Tobol No. 1.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
In Japan.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Which Tobol No. 1 was also a good game.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And uh had previews of Bushido Blade and Saga Frontier.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
And uh there were just lots of cool stuff.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
There was a PC version that came out um on Windows.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
But it was uh.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Really.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
And when it came out for systems at the time.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
It was really uh.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Requirement heavy.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
It really pushed systems.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And it played really slow.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000
It was.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Molasses.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Um.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Although now I've found that people have done um.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Different uh.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Patches form.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Where they have the Advent Children thing.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
There's a whole Advent Children remake.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Um.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Using the Final Fantasy 7 PC version.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
They've reskinned.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
The music.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
They've done uh.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
HD versions.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
It's pretty crazy.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
And then I saw someone actually um.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Going through and using the um.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Unreal Engine to re-render whole scenes.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And I was hoping that someone was like.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
There's a fan remake project out there too.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
But they haven't.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Uh.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Really put anything concrete out there.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
So.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I was really disappointed with that.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
But I mean.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Like.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
You've heard the music.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
It's fantastic.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000
I've got the soundtrack.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
It's wonderful.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Now there's um.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
A few things about this game.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
That.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000
I got an old.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I have a strategy guide.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
That was based off the Japanese version.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
So I really wanted to play the Japanese version for a while.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
And so I finally got to borrow my friends.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
And there's this little thing.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I was telling you about it this morning Rob.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
These little things called Test Zero.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
That look like blocky Dobermans.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
And if you go into the gold saucer in the prison.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
And go in the well.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
They hide out in the well.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
There's three of them.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000
It's a random encounter.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
And if you keep attacking them.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
And attacking and attacking and attacking and attacking.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Um.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
They will uh.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000
They just beg for their life the whole time.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And then when you kill them you get like a million experience.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
So you can like power level.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
But it's not in the US one.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I tried.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Not in the US one.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Um.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
There were.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Safe.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
There were.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
This was in the days of Dex files.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000
You know.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
When you could download.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
When you had the Dex drives.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000
You could download the uh.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Memory card data.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Is uh.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I got.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I always got the Tifa date.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Because I hated Aerith.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
But I downloaded like a safe file that had all the other dates.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
You could do a date with Aerith.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
The ho-bag.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
You could do a date with Barret.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And a date with Yuffie.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Which.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
The Barret date was just.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Funny.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Total bromance.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Anyway.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Um.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
And you play the whole game to find out the clouds fucking nuts.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
And Sephiroth is even crazier.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
And uh.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Aerith is dead.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Which is the best part of the game.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Um.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
But yeah.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
There's been rumors of Squeenix doing a remake.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000
And they said they would.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000
There's people who said they would love to dedicate the time to it.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
To do it with the Final Fantasy 13 style.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
So basically doing it in Unreal Engine.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Um.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
There are other games related to the series.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000
There's Crisis Core.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Which is basically the tale of Zax and Chibi Cloud.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
And there's uh.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
George of Cerberus.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Which is a shooting game.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Well kind of first person shooter-y starring Vincent.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Which I sadly have but have not yet set down to play.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Um.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
There were the phone games.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Remember?

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
What was it?

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Um.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000
After Crisis?

01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Before Crisis.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Before Crisis.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000
That was it.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Yeah.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Um.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000
It was Before Crisis.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Um.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And then there's any.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
There's you know.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
The Advent Children Complete.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
The DVD thing.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Which is awesome.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Actually the ending song has a cameo by Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Just wanted.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Only in the Japanese version.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Which is stupid.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
But anyway.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Um.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Just one of the best games ever.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000
And of course.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Um.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Amano went back and did a lot of special art.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Um.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
As promotional material for Final Fantasy 7.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
So uh.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
I.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
The only ones that I have of those are what's in my huge mungus Amano art book.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Um.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
But you can find them online.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
They're out there.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
And so that's Final Fantasy 7.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
It's considered.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I mean.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I think 6 was a more solid game.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000
But 7 is what sits on.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
I.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
I.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I'll put it this way.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
I owned two games before I even had a Playstation that I could say was mine.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
One of them was Final Fantasy 7 and the other one was um.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
A Dragon Ball GT Final Bout.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Which I wish I'd kept on.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Held onto because it was worth money and I traded it for uh.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
What's that?

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Blue Stinger on Dreamcast for the Japanese version.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
But that's it.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Those are the two games I owned.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Alright.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
There it is.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Your classic game of the week everybody.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Final Fantasy 7.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000
As we listen to Dark Soccer and Dan have a fight about what they did and they didn't

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
own.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Anyhow.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Uh.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
That's gonna do it for part A of Orange Lawn Studio.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
But don't go anywhere you guys.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
We're gonna come back for more of Orange Lawn Studio with part B.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Where we're gonna talk about uh.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000
One internet service provider might be throttling your bandwidth when it comes to games.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Also we're gonna talk about some possible serious problems with the Wii U.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
It might not really work.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Oh shit.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
And of course rapid fire news.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Your tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Your emails at mailbagatorangelawnsradio.com and your calls on the skype line.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
All when we come back with more of Orange Lawn Studio.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
But before we go to our break tonight.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I gotta say I believe Irene unfortunately is going to be leaving us.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Um. Because uh. She's uh. Got like homework and like real world stuff.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Mhm.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Geez.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
But uh. Thanks for sitting in on the show.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I'm sorry you didn't get to talk too much.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
But.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
That's okay. I talked enough.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
It's. It's nice to hear from you.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Don't be a stranger.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Sure.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Is there any uh. Parting words you want to say to our listeners tonight?

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Not really. No.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Okay. Well then get out.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Bye.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
I'm just kidding.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Well thanks for being here.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
And uh. Maybe we'll hear you at least if not on OLR in the future.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Maybe a future episode of Hoard House.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Or somewhere in the Orange Lounge Radio family of programming.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Indeed.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Alright.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Alright.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Alright. So. There you go.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Uh. We're going to take a break guys.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
But don't go anywhere.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
We are live on this Sunday evening.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
September the 11th of 2011.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
With the 427th episode of our show.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
And we just had a fun Part A there.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Acknowledging the fact that it is Loki's birthday today.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
And if you missed that in Part A.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Uh. Irene showed up tonight.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
She's left sadly.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
But uh. She brought Loki some bacon.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Well they're not. They're bacon cupcakes.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
But basically she's.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Bacon garnished.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Bacon garnished cupcakes.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Like there's not bacon inside the cupcakes.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
But it is pretty good I guess.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
We finally dived into him during the break and ate them.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
We have a present in here now.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
So there you go.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Dan the man is here in studio joining us.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
What have you been playing lately Dan?

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Dan of course. Dark Soccer's husband.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
What have you been up to?

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
I'm working.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
You're working? You're not playing games?

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I haven't got to play many games.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
What is up with that?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Everybody's been saying that tonight.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I've been working too much to play games.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I understand though.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I know you just recently started employment again.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
And all that good stuff so.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
But that's good. That's a good thing.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I did just pick up a copy of Left 4 Dead 2.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Yeah.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
But I'm like too cheap to pay for Xbox Live.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
After getting it for free for the last six years.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Right.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
And I'm kind of like oh man.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Three months is 25 bucks?

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Screw Xbox Live.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Why didn't you guys go over to PlayStation 3 then?

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Because none of the people I play games with have a PlayStation 3.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
You know I um.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I apologize. I forget who said this in chat.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
It's just a question that came up and it scrolled by.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
But it was while Dark Soccer was doing the classic game of the week.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
So I couldn't bring it up.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
But to summarize the question was.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
If a game is available on multiple platforms.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Including PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000
What goes into your decision to decide what console you get the game on?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
And for me.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Certainly price weighs into it and bonus features and things of that sort.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000
But it's really about like where are my friends playing?

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000
And most of the time if it's online they're probably on Xbox Live.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000
But there have been games that I've bought on PlayStation 3 for the simple fact.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I am not going to use the fucking Xbox controller to play this game.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000
My decision for playing some of these is who can I borrow it from?

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I'm kind of the opposite. I like the 360 controller.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Really? Aw. But for some games I can't stand it.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Like Super Street Fighter 4. I bought it on the PlayStation 3 simply because.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Can't fucking stand the Xbox 360 controller for fighters.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
That's why God made arcade sticks.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Yeah but I don't want to buy an arcade stick.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Yes you do.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I kind of do. You're right.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Told ya.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000
There are some games I would like to play with an arcade joystick.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Alright so Left 4 Dead 2. I'm going to get back into that.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I guess you've got some friends.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
I've never really started on that. I played like the demo.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I've liked both Left 4 Deads and I was always like.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Yeah it's like a first person shooter.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Seems like it might be kind of cool if I was playing with other people.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
But it's no fun to play by yourself.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
I've watched Salacious Pop play a little bit of that and it looks interesting.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
But I tried to play it and I am fucking terrible at it.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000
It's easy to find more people that have it in the system link.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
It's such a team based game. I just bring the team down.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Well the problem is one of the people we're going to play with is in Washington.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000
We don't have that long of an ethernet cable.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:01.000
If anyone has an 800 mile ethernet cable, hook it up.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Actually X-Link Kai. You can do that.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
That's system link over the internet.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Oh yeah like the game spy tunnel thing they used to do.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Yeah.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Nice.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:16.000
The one component that I have a hard time defining when I would buy a game for is the PC.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Because I'm kind of like.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Oh PC games are usually pretty niche.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And a lot of times the games I buy on the PC are only on the PC.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Diablo 3 would be a good example.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Although it's very likely Diablo 3 is coming to console.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I'm not going to wait for it.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I want it when it fucking comes out.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
And I bought Starcraft 2 on PC.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
I bought Civilization 5 on PC.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Those games only exist on PC.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:46.000
The cross platform stuff, I tend to gravitate towards the console strictly because I like to curl up on the couch.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Play the game.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Like I don't know. There's just PC games has a different.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Maybe it's ridiculous. I don't know.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:56.000
But just like sitting in the office chair playing my PC games is not the same to me as being on the couch.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I love Steam.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
All lazy.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Yeah and Steam will occasionally have those really fucking good sales that will make me want to buy a game on it.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000
So.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
That was broken.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.000
But like Portal is a good example of a game I bought on PC because it was a really good fucking deal.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I prefer playing it on PC.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
I mean for me it's just easier to control even with my trackball mouse.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Now that's a keyboard mouse thing right?

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Yeah.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Yeah.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I play, but see I played Portal on my PC because it looked better but I used a 360 controller.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Interesting. Okay.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I tried playing it with a 360 controller and I just didn't like it.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
It wasn't very intuitive to me.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Yeah I played DC Universe on the PC but I played with a controller.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Now I was, you know, I was stuck on using a controller forever like when I played Final Fantasy XI.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I used a controller.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I had all my macros queued to my trigger buttons and everything.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:55.000
And I played PSO, you know, with a controller and it wasn't until I started playing World of Warcraft that I started playing keyboard and mouse.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Something that came up on this week's Hoard House, Plug Plug, the show I do all about, all things World of Warcraft at www.hoardhouse.com.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Never too seriously though with Extifer.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000
One of the things he brought up this week was that his brother in law likes to play World of Warcraft.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I guess something he's been getting into on a PS3 controller.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
And like it actually kind of works.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:17.000
And the way it, it's very similar to how Final Fantasy XI played on the PlayStation 2 controller where you have to kind of macro things to buttons.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
But it actually kind of works.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
He was doing quests with them and everything.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000
I guess the only thing that gets a little wonky I think he said was the camera gets a little weird.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000
I can see that.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
But I found that to be very interesting.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:31.000
But you know if he's fast enough with macro attacks I bet using a controller would make it really good for PvP.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Yeah. Could be very interesting.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Because I can't do PvP because I can't mouse turn with my mouse.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I just do hide in the corner while everyone else does PvP.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000
That's why the big battlegrounds are fun.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Yeah that's why. I like the big battlegrounds.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Yeah so I guess it's really just a number of factors that go into the decision.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I can't like sit here and say, oh I would always go PS3.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Because I don't.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
It just kind of, where's everyone else going to be?

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
What kind of game is it?

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Where am I going to be playing it the most?

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000
All those things kind of weigh into it.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000
For me I really just prefer almost anything on Xbox 360.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:13.000
The controller feels pretty comfortable to my hand because I have to have a slightly wider reach on the PS3.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.000
And the way that the little parts that stick out sit on my hand is because of my surgery really.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
So it's hard for me.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I will say this.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I'm glad I have the choice.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And I realize not everyone invests in the 360 and the PS3.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:31.000
And a high end PC capable of running today's games.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I realize not everybody can juggle all those things.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:40.000
But you know I like that I'm fortunate enough where I have been able to have all those so I can make the decision.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.000
For the record I just got completely light headed once the sugar hit my brain.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
From those cupcakes.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I know.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Good times.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And my stomach aches.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
The butter and the buttercream is kind of making me feel sick.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000
I only ate one.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I'm eating it anyways.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.000
I had a frappuccino on the way in here and that was enough sugar so I didn't need it.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000
We'll get you the other lid for that other container.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000
You guys all know how I feel about pumpkin and pumpkin spice frappuccinos are back.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I want a pumpkin spice muffin right the hell now.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
No I've been wanting one since breakfast.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
So.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
You better go now before all the Starbucks close.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
So tomorrow.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
You know what?

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
They should have had pumpkin at um.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
No because I didn't like the pumpkin at Pinkberry.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Oh I love the pumpkin at Pinkberry.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
It was good.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000
It wasn't as good.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Anyway.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Yeah.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Let's get into rapid fire news.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Back to gaming news.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
A lot of quick stories we want to talk about with you guys.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Before we get to some of the other stuff.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Loki start us off.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Just like they did with the Resident Evil series.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000
They're going to be bringing HD remakes of Devil May Cry 1, 2, and 3.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
To the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
And this is coming to us from an ESRB leak.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Or well.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
A rating I guess.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
It leaked out that they were putting that stuff out.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000
But.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
It's been rated for all three games.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000
On um.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
On the consoles.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000
So.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Uh.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Very interesting that those will be coming out.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000
And uh.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000
They're kind of the trend lately.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Just do some HD remakes and.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Pop them up on there and people will buy them.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
So.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Look for an announcement I'm sure.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Soon.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Um.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
And the kind that go along with that.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Crisis.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Rumor to be coming to the new consoles.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Um.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Now has um.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I guess it's going to be coming to the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this October.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Also coming I believe from a leak as well.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Um.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
And of course these games are going to be remastered.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
They're going to be also available in 3D.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
And they're.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000
They announced that they're going to be 1600 Microsoft points or 1999.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Um.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000
So that's kind of cool.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
And those will be coming soon.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000
And the original crisis was a really good game.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Just.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000
I couldn't finish mine on the PC because.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Well.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
It wouldn't let me.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Bad glitches.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
And then last but not least.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
There's this trend.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I wouldn't say it's a.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Big trend.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000
But uh.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Something that they call swatting.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
It's a griefing trend.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Basically one of the Xbox Live mods.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
I had this happen to him.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Swatting is where somebody basically calls up the FBI or tips off you know the police

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
or whatever that.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
A certain person that you say may want to grief.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Has you know bombs or hostages or whatever in their house.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000
And of course since police have to take things like that seriously.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
They go and storm the guys house and.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.000
What not.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Um.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000
So yeah apparently this guy had it happened and.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.000
They.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.000
The police chief believes that the griefers hacked into a nine one one text messaging

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
service to pull off.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Um.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
The griefing.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000
So they're all we have officers respond in lights and sirens.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.000
To call they think is an emergency in progress and they get there only to find out it's a

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
hoax.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
So apparently that's fucked up.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000
There's a hundred hundred documented cases.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.000
So far the FBI is tracking so.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000
All the way from like Oregon to Florida.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.000
That is so fucked up to do that like that in juvenile that better fucking come around

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000
to bite these people in the ass because not only is it just fucked up to do to somebody

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
but that is such a waste of money because the police department the fire department

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
all that they've got to take that shit seriously you know.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:37.000
And that's thousands of dollars of our money that's spent on these laws and it's not fucking

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
funny.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
You know what I mean.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
It's just sad.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Very unfortunate.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Although I'd have to ask is how the fuck do they get the guy's address.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
That's a very good question.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Unfortunately probably more hacking of some sort or could it be as simple as the guys

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
in the yellow or the white pages.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Does that even exist anymore.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I guess there are still phone books.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Yeah they they drop a phone book off at my doorstep every once in a while.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000
This is a big advertisement for all the companies so you know what.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.000
The day and age that we live in right now with the Internet I just throw that shit in

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
the garbage.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
The phone book's a waste of money.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
It's unfortunate.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Anyhow.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Moving on to some more news.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
The Sim social we mentioned earlier.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:22.000
It is currently a more active game than Farmville on Facebook.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.000
So Sim social is now actually surpassed Farmville in the amount of daily active users.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:33.000
The Sim social is seeing an average of nine point three million active users per day.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000
They play on the average three times a day in 15 to 20 minute increments.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Of course if you're dark soccer that's backwards.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:43.000
She plays 15 to 20 times a day in three minute increments.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Just kidding.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000
That's pretty true.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Okay I'm not kidding.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Anyhow Farmville still has eight point one million people but the most popular game on

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Facebook right now.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Cityville also by Zynga.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Thirteen point nine million users a day.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.000
The only app that gets more traffic than that is Windows Messenger Live which is somehow

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000
integrated into Facebook.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I've never even used that.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000
There you go.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.000
So what isn't said is how much fucking wall spam has gone out because of this app.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.000
It's one of those things I hate that I play it but I can't stop playing.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Argh.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
I would block people that did that.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Here's a game that I can't be sad about enjoying because it's really fucking good.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Little Big Planet 2.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Well okay so I haven't really played the sequel like I've played the original.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
But I will at some point.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.000
It just went on sale.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I need to get it.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Little Big Planet 2 just got its move patch.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I guess it's.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
I could loan it to you.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
It's not.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Oh that'd be great.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000
It's not going live just yet until the move pack goes out.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.000
But update 1.06 is out which does release some new censors.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Some limiting players on homebrew levels.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.000
You can control the basic game with the move controller now.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:55.000
So all that stuff is setting up to take away for the move support officially in Little

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Big Planet 2 which comes with the move pack very very very soon.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Lastly if you build games a little more seriously than Little Big Planet 2.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Not to say Little Big Planet is a serious business.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
But this is real serious business.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Raw source code of popular games.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000
How popular?

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Wolfenstein 3D Platinum and Doom Classic.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Don't worry guys.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.000
This is legit.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
ID Software actually released the source codes themselves.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
You can go get the source codes for these games.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
And there you go.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000
It's update 2.1.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000
And you can go grab the source code and tinker away at that.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I'd be excited to see what kind of games come out of that.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
I think the Wolfenstein code had been released before and this is some type of upgrade.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
But there you go.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Moving on Dark Soccer.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
What do you have for us?

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
How about some DJ Max Technica?

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
I know that you like that game right?

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
I do.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
The arcade game is pretty awesome.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
What's coming to the Vita?

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
It's going to be.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Yeah it's actually DJ Max Technica going to be out on the Vita.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000
There is not a date yet but they say it looks like it's going to be really hard.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
And that it's going to use both the touch screen and the rear touch panel.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000
So who knows?

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000
That makes a lot of sense considering that you know when I heard about this I was like

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
oh yeah cause the game is basically on a giant touch screen.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
It's basically Elite Beat Agents.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Yeah.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
And then other news.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Microsoft says 42% of US Xbox Live Gold members watch an average of an hour of video content a day.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000
And that's including Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Zune on Xbox 360.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:36.000
So it looks like there are going to be quite a bit more going on.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:41.000
In fact it was reported by Terry Farrell, not to be confused with the lady that played Judzia Dax.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Who is the Senior Product Manager of Xbox Live Entertainment.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
This report comes from him.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000
So they're going to definitely be working to up that in the fall dashboard update.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.000
And then sad, sad, sad news.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Game writing pioneer Bill Kunkel passed away.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Very sad.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
He died on September 4th.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
He was the Game Doctor.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Does that sound familiar to anybody?

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
I totally remember the Game Doctor columns from the old magazines from back in the...

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Oh god that was like the 80s.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Computer Gaming World.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Video Game Computer Entertainment, right?

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Yep.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.000
And the original Electronic Games, not to be confused with Electronic Gaming Monthly.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Yeah.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Oh yeah.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.000
The Commodore 64 magazines.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000
We had them all.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
That and the Commodore 64 magazines.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
But Bill wasn't a part of those.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000
I don't think.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Well he was 61 years old.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
And he'd been working on video game columns since 1978.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000
And he co-founded EGM.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Wow.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
He will be missed.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.000
As I understand it, he was working right up until the unfortunate...

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Because the death was unexpected as I hear.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
So he was still doing some work on websites and so forth.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
So it's surprising.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000
It's very unfortunate.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
I'm pulling up a list of other things that he worked on.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Because he said he also did stuff for DC and Marvel.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Actually also worked with KKWD, Fogg Studios, Metropolis Media.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Busy guy.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Lots of stuff.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:24.000
And did a lot of the strategy guides for Prima.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Oh wow.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Maximo Carnage, Descent, FPS Baseball, Gex, Die Hard Trilogy, NFL Quarterback Club 98, Madden 64, and Brady.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
So he was actually getting into game development at some point.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000
He did Madden 64 for a Brady game. Sorry.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Oh I see. Okay. Interesting.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
So yeah, pretty crazy stuff.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000
It's too bad.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Yeah.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Too bad.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Well that's it for our quick news tonight.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000
So let's get back into more news.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I don't know why we have the quick news and then the long news.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
But I don't know. It's just the way we've been doing it.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Whatever. Let's move on. Loki.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:10.000
So you may remember that during Gamescom they announced that the PSP is going to be getting a new version out in Europe that was going to be Sans Wi-Fi.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:17.000
And we're kind of wondering why they went ahead and did this seeing as the Vita is going to be coming out soon.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Well one of the things that they're trying to do is target teens.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000
They're saying it's all for the audience.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:29.000
If we're going to take PSP very young, teens and much younger, they're happy to just play the game.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:34.000
If taking Wi-Fi out is the price to pay, we're happy to do it.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:42.000
And they also believe that the price point will give the console a much needed sales bump, especially during the upcoming holiday season.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:50.000
And they're saying that at 99 euro it'll make a great Christmas gift.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Of course the new system is dubbed the E1000.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Honestly, if you're really looking for a PSP system, you can buy a new system for less than that with Wi-Fi.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.000
But it's what the gamers want, Loki. It's what the 13 year old gamers want.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Wi-Fi doesn't cost that much. I mean, come on.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:21.000
And you know what? Teenagers nowadays have smartphones. They have iPods, iPhones, whatnot.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Teenagers do not need a PSP. They need a school book.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I understand that, but they are connected to the internet.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000
It's like they're saying, well, teenagers are just happy to play the game.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Yes, some of them are just happy to play the games.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:45.000
But you know what? You can still buy one of your older PSP systems and have that functionality in there for the same price, if not cheaper.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Have you heard that whole, not to deviate too much from the story, but have you heard that whole story about how the kids at some schools in certain districts are now, instead of getting textbooks, they get iPads with the books on them?

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Because, believe it or not, a $600 iPad or whatever, well, what's the lowest one cost? Maybe $400?

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Those iPads are cheaper than some of the textbooks for all those classes combined.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000
It's like the iPad is becoming a cheaper alternative. It's crazy.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.000
To the textbooks.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Yep. How about this? How about instead of spending $500 on an iPad, which granted is a good piece of technology, but how about you spend it on a cheaper e-reader and you can put those books on there?

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Dude, you can get HP touch pads for $100. They should have got in on that deal.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I mean, if it's reading just books, that's all it's doing, I think there's cheaper alternatives out there than just that.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Or, here's an idea, pretty much everybody, you know, nowadays in school and stuff, and I know that there's people out there that are, you know, without a substantial income, but you gotta admit, most people probably have a PC at home.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Right.

01:59:51.000 --> 02:00:00.000
You know, the majority of people out there have a PC. Just give it to them in like a PDF format or something like that. I guess if you're bringing it to the school, but...

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:07.000
What are the authors of those books? I mean, a desktop. You could have a desktop computer at each one of these desk...

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
I think a lot do now.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Yes, and then just have the book on there.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Geez. Alright, going to our chatroom at chat.orangetonshade.com, taking you back to what the story was originally about before we got on that tangent, ToaGak in our chatroom says,

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:36.000
You want to know what my PSP is used for? 99% WiFi, 1% games. You know, I've heard that a lot. Not so much the teenage crowd, but the college crowd really loves that the PSP is a web browser, an MP3 player, and it happens to play games.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:44.000
And I've said this a million times on the show before. I'm starting to sound like a broken record. The PSP's biggest strength was always the fact that it didn't just do games.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.000
It did, well, like their little tagline, it only does everything, and that really is Sony's strength.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.000
It's not going to do much, though, when it doesn't have WiFi.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Exactly. So it's like, it only does nothing, is what this system does.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:10.000
I just don't understand what the point is, because it will help bump sales. I don't know about the Europe region, but in the US and North America, there's not a lot of PSP games coming out.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.000
There's like five. Five for the whole fourth quarter.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:20.000
I was fascinated to go to Fry's today, as I was talking about before, and see that they are still selling the PSP movies.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
You can still buy PSP movies.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Yeah, probably got them for a good deal, because no one's selling them anymore.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Five to ten bucks.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Sony was the only one for the longest time that was putting out movies on that system. The last movie I remember on the UMD format was 2012.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:45.000
That's a Sony title, so obviously that makes sense why that would be on there. Well, it sort of makes sense.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Those things are dirt cheap now. They're definitely not manufacturing them anymore.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Yeah, I don't understand the point. Of course they want their system to sell well, but I think removing a pretty integral feature from the system that, once again, with the whole PSP Go and stuff,

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:11.000
you don't need to reinvent the system to help it sell. Why are you going to spend more money on a system that does less?

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:19.000
That's the whole point here. Why would I spend more money on a system that doesn't have Wi-Fi when I can use this in preferred, but you know what?

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Those so-called teenagers probably don't give a shit that it's a little bit used, and it will come with games for less than that.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:37.000
In fact, I think I was taking a look here. I saw some new, well, some used PSP systems on eBay.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:47.000
We'll see here. They've got the Giga pack or whatever. $65 starting on those used.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Also, if you just want the PSP Slim, they have the Slim with Crysis Core, the Final Fantasy VII bundle or whatever, and silver. $89.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:03.000
And I know that the Euros, that's almost one and a half times the US dollar.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:13.000
I mean, shit, you can buy a new system here for $129.99, brand new. And they're region-free, so why not?

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Or at this point, you might as well just wait for the Vita.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Alright, we'll get something else.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Well, moving on to a totally different topic. This is about not getting between somebody and their bandwidth.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:31.000
You know, nothing gets the internet rabble-rabble more than hearing about internet service providers and their recent restrictions.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Well, this has to do with a Canadian provider, actually. It has to do with Rogers Cable and Telcom, who's Canada's largest broadband provider.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Apparently, they had some complaints from World of Warcraft players saying that the World of Warcraft traffic was being throttled.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Now, oh my gosh, that just goes double so. Do not get between, and I say this as a Warcraft player, do not get between me and my WoW.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Do not try to limit my bandwidth and lower my ping times.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:04.000
And there was accusations that Rogers was apparently throttling the bandwidth and so forth.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Rogers has admitted that the game's online traffic might actually trip the monitors that kind of monitor this stuff and result in throttling.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.000
They are calling this inadvertent, but that doesn't fix the problem.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
I guess Canadian regulators have even gotten involved.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.000
The Canadian Gamers Organization, I didn't even know that existed. That's kind of cool.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.000
They actually filed an inquiry into the practices of this company.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:40.000
So I guess what happens is because you've got the peer-to-peer traffic going on in World of Warcraft, it's being misclassified as something more nefarious.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.000
By the way, the same thing apparently is happening in Call of Duty Black Ops.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:52.000
I guess the rule is that if something is transmitting 80 kbps or more, it is what is enabling the throttling.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:58.000
So, now Rogers says that the games can all run underneath that rate.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:03.000
So those who are experiencing the throttling must be running some type of other application with the gaming.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.000
But I kind of sit there and go, what about Ventrilo and some of the other stuff?

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:15.000
I'm notorious for playing WoW and surfing the web at the same time. Just put a renew on somebody and then go alt-tab and check my email.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Anyhow, let's see. I guess the co-founder of the Canadian Gamer Organization said,

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:42.000
quote, rather than fixing the issue and actively whitelisting gaming systems to ensure they are not affected, Rogers is continuing to rely on consumer input and complaints rather than put forth the active testing needed to ensure compliance with CRTC policy.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.000
We believe this approach is inappropriate under these circumstances.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:56.000
So the Canadian Gamer Organization is going to ask for a new law requiring providers like Rogers to have a formal way for customers to report complaints.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Canadians are pissed and you don't hear that very often.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Honestly, I think I would be too.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Oh yeah, you don't get between somebody and their WoW. You just don't. Call of Duty, all those people.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Especially, the shitty thing is that it is legitimate use of the internet and it's being throttled.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Like, I understand why they want to throttle bandwidth and so forth, but you know, unfortunately, legit people pay the cost of somebody else.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:32.000
All the time, the common thing. Same thing we've said about DRM time and time again.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Let's get to the emails.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:43.000
DarkSocker is going to dive into the email bag and pull out a few of her favorite emails.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Ew, it's so sticky!

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Alright, the first one.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Hi all, just wanted to point out that you could actually surf the net on the DS.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:58.000
They just didn't release the attachments in the USA. When I was in Japan, I bought it and it was one of the ones that used the GBA slot in a different way.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:06.000
As for the 3DS vs Vita, well, I just got a 3DS. The PSP never appealed to me. I love the 3DS.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Although I did buy mine on eBay for $195 for 3DS games included and the Nintendo Ambassador program.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:17.000
With the Vita, and by the way, it's V-I-T-A, not D-A.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:27.000
It would have to pull off something really impressive because Netflix on my 3DS is awesome.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Not going to buy another system if the one I have now can do it already and that's from Holly D.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:42.000
You know what, that is correct. I could have sworn we would have made that clear because I was aware that the DS had a web browser but only on the DS's that had the eShop.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:50.000
And that would start with the DSi and above. However, I do remember that I did forget that Japan did have a cart.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Actually, I found one for sale at the local dimple.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
The US also had a cart.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Did they really?

02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Yes, it came with a memory expansion slot that goes in the Game Boy Advance slot.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Well, I did forget about the browser and the cartridge.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
But still terrible.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Yeah, I don't like browsing the web on the 3DS either.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.000
It is terrible.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
It's clunky, I don't know.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Well, moving forward.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Needs to be optimized. Ok.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Evening. I would have sent this last week but didn't realize you had a Labor Day weekend show.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Anyhow, I see the mobile game Flight Control is now available for WiiWare.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Fairly nice to have this one on a full display with local multiplayer, although the lack of versus is somewhat disappointing.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Also, it really puts the infamous Wii Remote jitter front and center.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Sorry, I believe last year Firemint was supposed to have a PS Move version of the game.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Did they say why this never came out in North America?

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
And that's from Robert M.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
No, and I got to admit, I'm not very familiar with that game.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.000
What is it called again?

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Flight Control?

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Hmm.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Loki, is this a game you know about?

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:59.000
I think Flight Control is one of those air traffic controller games where you control the different planes that are taking off and stuff.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
I think they have that kind of stuff on the iPod.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
It might have been a WiiWare game.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
It said it was originally a mobile game.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Yeah.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
I'm looking at a trailer here for the game.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:14.000
I'm so visual, I need to see this here.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Oh!

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
See?

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Once I see it, this is based on an iPad game.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:24.000
This is where you draw the path of the planes and you don't want them to collide.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000
This is based off an iPad game.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
See?

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000
I just had to see it.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
I do know this game.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.000
I didn't know that they had ported it to anything besides the iPad.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.000
That part's news to me.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000
So there you go.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Sorry, I don't know the other answer to your question.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000
I'm sorry.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Rob, you're going to need to pull up this email because apparently there's a YouTube link.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I'm going to copy it to you.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Yeah, just copy the YouTube link to me.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
But I will read you the...

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Let me just paste it to you real quick.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Live radio, kids.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.000
It's what we're all about here.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Hey, I'm fast.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
With my damn trackball.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Do I play it now or when you say?

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.000
After this.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I'll go ahead and read this.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Yo homies, Xenocore here.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:12.000
I'm sad that I just discovered this song, but you must use this for Listless this Sunday.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Okay?

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
For Listless?

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
This is from the Rubber Bandits, Horse Outside.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
And don't use the clean version.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
This song is freaking awesome.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
I think they're talking about Cage Match.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Oh, yeah.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
It's probably Cage Match.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
But, hey.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Don't be going fucking dumb stuff and around like one of them covers, you know?

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Dudes with accents.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Let me forward a little bit here.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Yeah, I think this is something for the Cage Match segment, not the...

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Veto.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.000
That's it.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
I'll check it out later.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Veto.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Not when we're live on air.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Okay.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Well, that's it.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
That's it?

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000
That's it.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
We need more emails.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Well, the other one was someone trying to get us to, like, post his stuff, and I'm like,

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000
no.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Orangelauntrader.com.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Free plugs.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
You have to disguise for free plugs.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000
I'm not free.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
All right.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
All right.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Let's get to the part of the show where we...

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
It costs a lot of money to be this cheap.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Let's get to the part of the show where we get ranty.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.000
It's the FUs of the week, and we do them here on the show because we can.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:36.000
FU to finding out about emo crap during the show.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Ugh.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Loki.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Fucking my cat for being an asshole.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Um.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
I don't know.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000
FU to the fact that this weekend was shorter than last weekend.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
No, FU to the three-hour nap I took yesterday.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:54.000
This is the first weekend in forever where I had literally nothing planned on Saturday.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.000
It was amazing to just sit at home all day and veg.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
But what did I do?

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000
I napped literally the whole damn day away.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
But I feel really rested, and I feel great.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
So, I guess I needed it.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
But FU to what felt like a wasted day.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
All right.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.000
A few more news stories for you guys, then we're gonna open it up to you guys via Twitter,

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R, and our Skype line at 1877 game O-L-R.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.000
But don't call yet, because we still have a few more stories to get through.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Yeah, Origin has been doing pretty well.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:29.000
EA's new, um, kind of e-commerce site for streaming game.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Well, not really streaming games, but downloading digital games and stuff like that.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000
They have four million client installs.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:42.000
That doesn't really translate into purchases, but it's been installed on four million computers.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:46.000
They're gonna be adding third-party content very soon.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:58.000
And, of course, they're saying that it will use its collection of 130 million users and various payment methods to attract third-party games to Origin.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.000
So, wait a second.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:09.000
So, what they're saying is they have four million client installs, yet 130 million users?

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
That doesn't really make sense to me.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Whatever.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:19.000
I guess they're talking about maybe the Electronic Arts site and how they have that, like, uh...

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Oh, like when you do Dragon Age and stuff? You have to sign up for their stupid online thing?

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Yeah, I like how they count all those players in there.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:32.000
They don't have a choice. They have to sign up on that site in order to play those games.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:39.000
It's not like, oh, I love EA. I'm gonna totally register an account with them because they're awesome,

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
and I love their products, and I really...

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
You have no choice.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.000
But I like how they skew that. That's awesome.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:58.000
And then, of course, there's some information from Origin regarding a new remake of Syndicate, that series.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Apparently, it's gonna be done by the developer Starbreeze, who did Escape from Butcher Bay and The Darkness.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:13.000
And I guess they're showing off some stuff. Some stuff, I guess, leaked out from their website.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Looks interesting. They're saying that the story's penned by the guy that did the Crysis 2 script,

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
and he also wrote some books and stuff.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Also, that it's supposed to debut next week in the Game Reactor magazine, which is a Swedish publication.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:42.000
And, I don't know, it looks kinda cool. So, I guess, check out the EA Origins store if you wanna catch some details on that,

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:47.000
or just check out the web, because it's leaked out.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Alright. I have yet to use the Origins store, but I remember we got a call last week saying it's not that bad, you guys.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.000
But it is interesting that it has so many installs, but isn't that because it's kind of forced on people?

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.000
I don't know.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Well, Origin, I mean, some of it's probably voluntary. Some of it was, didn't it become Origin, like it was something else,

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.000
and then it just translated over to Origin?

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:16.000
God, well, whenever I hear Origin, I think about the old school publishing house, or studio, that would make,

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
like the old Ultimate games are all Origin.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Yeah, I think that's what this is.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.000
No. No, no, no, no. This is Steam. This is their Steam competitor.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Well, I understand that, but Origin was that company, and now it's the site.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Right, EA sucked them up, and then never used the name, and now they just brought back the name for this,

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:36.000
but the two uses of the name have nothing to do with each other. Does that make sense?

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Oh, yeah, it makes sense.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Anyhow, Wii U, this has been some big news talking about this week, and, you know, while this reeks of being a rumor,

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:54.000
this is coming from that French site that's been getting a lot of smoking guns lately.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:01.000
They've become quite the site to get the early gossip, because they leaked the news about the Vita, right, I think?

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:05.000
They leaked the news about the extra thing on the 3DS, which now we have a picture of,

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:11.000
and now they're talking about this, so take it with a grain of salt, but it's very interesting we're writing the Wii U.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Apparently, they're saying that Nintendo is having big problems getting the Wii U up and running.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Apparently, the Wii U is not up to wanting to do what Nintendo needs it to do.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:28.000
It's not just running the console, but beaming the data to the touchscreen controller as well.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Apparently, developers that are working on the console, they use tethers to ensure that the communication,

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:40.000
so basically it has to do with the wireless aspect of it, and right now the developers have to use a wire to the controller

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.000
to make sure the information gets across fast enough.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Even then, apparently things aren't still working out that well.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Progress is halted daily with repeated software updates for the pad. Hmm, interesting.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Apparently, these problems are causing a delay in the console's launch.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Originally, they had been looking at June 2012, but now they're saying September 2012,

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:09.000
which to me, personally, I would have said, well, that was the timeframe I was thinking for the system anyways.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
That doesn't seem like such a huge setback.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Now, obviously, you can't prove these allegations. Nintendo, even though the blogs are trying to get them to comment,

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
they're not going to. They're going to say, we don't comment on re-imagination and speculation,

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:28.000
but it definitely kind of says, hmm, maybe this is not going to be ready by the time it needs to roll out,

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
or at least it's going to be really gimped.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:36.000
So I'm sure Loki's just ready to unfold on this one, right, Loki? What do you think of hearing all this?

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:46.000
It's still really early. I mean, I don't know. It's hard to say. I mean, it's not good.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I mean, I just don't know. I just don't know if it's really going to end up being true.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Obviously, they're not going to launch the system if it's, you know, not going to work.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:06.000
If it's flat doesn't work, they're not going to launch it, but might they have to downgrade it a little bit to get it to work?

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Or I guess it could go the other way around. They'd have to upgrade it to get it to work too, huh?

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:16.000
I'm not sure which way it goes. Do you downgrade the processing power so that way there's not as much data to transmit?

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Or do you upgrade, I guess, finding the balance?

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:25.000
But it is interesting that the PlayStation 3 kind of does this with the PSP right now.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.000
It's a little lag though. I mean, it wouldn't, the technology has to get a little bit better than that.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:34.000
I don't know how it's going to work with the PS3 and the Vita, but you know, it's a little bit laggy.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.000
And obviously, they don't want that on the Wii U.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:45.000
So, I'm wondering though what it uses because I was just looking this up.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Just a theory here. One reason why we may be seeing the whole 3DS getting a second analog stick is maybe they're just not going to put out the controller at all.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:19:09.000
It's just going to use the 3DS and because the 3DS has 802.11g, it's a lot more bandwidth than say, ad hoc wireless, which I'm not really sure what speed that's at, but I don't think it's as fast as wireless g.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:17.000
So, if that's the case, then they'd be able to fit more data through there. Plus, it's a smaller screen. Maybe? I don't know.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Interesting comment from Imaginomicon in chat. In all fairness, Kinect had basically the same situation.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000
That is, it couldn't do what they initially advertised and was eventually gimped.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Weren't there early rumors about the Kinect that the Kinect couldn't see certain races and things like that?

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Yeah, that's not true though.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Okay, that was just bad PR for Microsoft.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.000
They're all, oh, I can't see black people. No, that's not true.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Well, obviously I can now, but you know.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Well, it could before. It was just like, if you're playing on, you know, it depends on where you're playing. If you're playing with something with a lot of light interference or if it's too dark or something like that.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Well, I can't play Kinect in the dark either. I mean, you gotta have some, you know, some light.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:09.000
So, it was stupid because it was like, well, actually it won't detect anybody in those lighting conditions and not necessarily just people of a certain race.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:12.000
So, yeah, that was just...

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:21.000
But I do seem to recall that it seemed like the Kinect, I want to say there was a story about how they did have to kind of change the Kinect too.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Well, I think they dropped the resolution down so they could have more bandwidth to go between the sensor and, you know, the system.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:43.000
But, you know, that's just a little bit of data going back and forth via like USB, but this isn't even close to that. This is going to be like streaming video and inputs and stuff like that.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:48.000
You're talking about being able to play games streaming from your console onto the...

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Which, I don't understand why it's not possible. I mean, you can do it on the PSP, but you can do it on the PSP over the internet and over that 802.11g.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:08.000
So, maybe like I said before, more bandwidth there and allow you to be able to do what you can't do on the console.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Although, why couldn't you make the controller connect to your WiFi network?

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Hey, then you can even add it. So, hey, look, you can surf the web on this controller, but it's not going to let you do that.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.000
All right, well, let's move on with a few more stories before we get to the Twitter topics and phone calls.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.000
I'm expecting to hear about this and some phone calls tonight.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Dark Soccer, our next story.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Well, how about the scariest Xbox 360 game? Ooh, what do you think it would be?

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Scariest Xbox 360 game? I don't know.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Well, it looks that the major vote goes for Dead Space 2. That that is considered to be the scariest game.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:22:06.000
And this is coming just ahead of... What they did is they actually tested core and casual gamer's heart rate, sweat levels and body temperature, while playing Alan Wake, Resident Evil 5, Dead Space 2, and Condemned.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
It was sad that Yaris wasn't included in there.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Well, that would have been just... That would have been nausea inducing, not scary.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.000
How about connectable? Some of those fuckers are pretty frightening.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:23.000
They said that core gamers dealt better with the scares than the apparently wussy casual players.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:29.000
But they all experienced rapidly increased heart rate, stunted breathing, and a rise in skin temperature.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:40.000
And there were pretty vocal about some of it too, like one of them started screaming, oh my god, oh my god, this shit is so scary.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:45.000
It sounds like Shane when they're playing Silent Hill or something.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Other games that were considered but not found scary enough were Left 4 Dead 2, Gears of War 2, Condemned 2, Fear 1 and 2, Dead Space 1, and Silent Hill Homecoming, Alone in the Dark, and Mass Effect 2.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000
But they aren't scary enough to be.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:07.000
I told you about how Silent Hill Homecoming made me basically scream like a little girl and go shut the front door that had blown open from the wind, and oh my god, that was a horrible night.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Hearts.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Like who sits at home alone in the dark and plays Silent Hill? You're just asking for it.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Well, remember when Miklotov was visiting a while back and played through Silent Hill 2?

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:25.000
And we were all curled up in your living room, like on the couch, in the dark, watching him play.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
I don't think I was in there.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Actually, no, you weren't. You weren't there. I was there, and it was like, I think Irene was there.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.000
And, um, Eddie. I think Eddie was there.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
But yeah, that was pretty funny.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Well, Christopher was there.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Because it was when you were living with Christopher.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Ah, no, I probably just was out.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Yeah, you were gone.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.000
I was probably on a hot date.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.000
While you nerds were playing Silent Hill.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Dude, that shit was awesome.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Loki.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Um, so of course, you know, one of the pioneers of Project $10 was EA.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.000
And EA's been doing this for a while now.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Since June of last year, starting with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:17.000
They were including, basically, a voucher in their new games that allowed you to get online access.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Their online pass, if you will.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.000
And if you bought the game used, well, that might not be in there.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:29.000
And so you would have to pay $10 to be able to play online.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Well, EA has come out and said that they have made between $10 and $15 million from online pass.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:46.000
And apparently the revenues they said that they derived from that haven't been dramatic.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Um, but since they initiated the program, but it's not a failure at all.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:57.000
And when you consider that, that's spread across quite a few games.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:03.000
You know, Tiger Woods, NCAA football, both years for NCAA football and Madden.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
EA does a lot of sports games.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.000
EA, MMA, um, lots of stuff.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:15.000
I don't think any non-sports games have been part of this so far, but it's just been sports games.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:22.000
But also figure, though, that nowadays, especially the EA Sports MMA and some of the older games,

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:29.000
it is still cheaper to buy the game with the $10 pass and use rather than buying it new.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:34.000
So, you know, some people might not really think of it as a big deal.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:42.000
And really, they only have to, that's about 1 million people that have bought into this.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.000
They've split that across, you know, over five games or whatever.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:50.000
That's, you know, quite a significant amount, I guess.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:55.000
But 200,000 per title, you know, split across platforms and stuff.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Wow, they, you know, despite, what do you want to call the number, big or small or whatever,

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.000
EA made money appear out of nowhere.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Yeah, good for them. It's not deserving.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:09.000
I don't think that they need that money because, once again, you know, their complaint was,

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:12.000
oh, well, those people that buy the game used, you know.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.000
The tax breaks they're getting from the government just aren't enough.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Did you read about that this week?

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Oh, yeah, I read about that.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Yeah, and their excuse, well, those people that are buying used, you know,

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:28.000
we can't support the online, you know, if they're buying the game used because we don't see any of their revenue.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Yeah, that's a nice way to spin it except for the fact that the person that first bought that game brand new

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.000
already paid you that money to, you know, keep up your network.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:45.000
So, too damn bad. Suck it up. You're EA. You can survive.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Well, if you really want to stick it to these developers, you could just say, and publishers and so forth,

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.000
you could just say, fuck it, I'm not even going to play these games anymore.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
I'm going to stick to free shit.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Or, if you want to play those games, don't play them online.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:04.000
And I'm not talking about piracy. I'm talking about actually designed to be free to play games.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:10.000
And I'm not talking about a crappy little Facebook game like SimSocial, which is a crap that I love.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Anyway, but this is a game. It's a free to download game. It's in beta right now.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
And it's a game called Oniken.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Oniken is, I guess, a tribute to challenging 8-bit action games from the NES.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.000
They say that the game is actually NES hard.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.000
And there's a little clip here I'm going to play in studio, and I think Dark Sakura would be into this

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.000
because it looks a bit like the guy's weapon he's using is very Strider-esque.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.000
But, yeah, once again, this is not like a NES ROM. This is actually-

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Oh my god, it does look like a cipher.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Doesn't it? This is actually designed to be a game on the PC that is just NES tribute, NES style hard.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.000
I don't know if that means, like, we're talking La-Mulana.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:55.000
For what?

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:58.000
It's like buying a command element.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.000
No, not to me.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Well, like, the backgrounds.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Oh, yeah, the artwork is very Bionic command element style.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
The gameplay, no, nothing like it, though.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000
It looks really fun, though.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Fast forward to some of these other levels.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Dude, that almost looks like a rip of the Ninja Gaiden sprite from the original game.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Like, they just switched it up a little bit.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Like, even his stance and the way he moves and stuff like that.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.000
A little bit, huh?

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Apparently, what's available right now to play three missions in the game.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Oniken, again, is the name of the game. O-N-I-K-E-N.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Lots of good visuals and so forth if you want to check it out for yourself.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Oniken.net. H-T-T-P colon slash slash W-W-W dot O-N-I-K-E-N dot net.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.000
And I will go ahead and paste that in chat for the live listeners.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Those of you on the podcast, I hope you were writing quickly.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Or maybe I can get Dark Soccer to Tumblr or at least the video there, so you guys can check that out.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Did you link it? Oh, there it is. Yeah. Okay, I'll put it on the thing.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Cool.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
That was kind of fun. I had to check that out.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Big Brother Blade?

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000
I like the fact that it's free.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Or Ogre Blade? Maybe? Ogre Blade?

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Free is my favorite word. Absolutely.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:18.000
How about we open up the phone line and take some of your calls right now.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:21.000
1-877-GAME-OLR. Speaking of free, you can call us free on that line.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
If you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight,

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:30.000
or if you have something gaming related that we haven't quite got to yet,

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
we will talk about that as well.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Meanwhile, we're going to fire up the Twitter and get to some of your tweets this week at Twitter dot com slash O-L-R.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Going to the tweets real quick.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
JVMon sent us a tweet tonight.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
When did WoW, Warcraft, get so fun?

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:49.000
I can't stop playing. I blame you. Hugs and kisses.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
When Cataclysm hit?

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:58.000
It's so interesting because to a lot of the hardcore, so to speak, Cataclysm was not so well received.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
So it's very interesting.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:06.000
I think the changing of the level 1 to 60 areas, though, is great for those that weren't quite yet into WoW.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:09.000
So, I think that was kind of cool, I guess.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:12.000
But yeah, Cataclysm hasn't been all bad news.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:18.000
It's just I think the early game is much more improved than the end game was, if that makes sense.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Anyhow, we've got calls coming in, so let's go to it.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
It's the one and only Ranma.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Hey, Ranma. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Oh, last week's podcast. That's what's on my mind tonight.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Why is that? It was long, wasn't it?

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Yes, yes, it was long, and that was the first time in history I've had to listen to it again just to absorb all that big G bullshit, you know what I'm saying?

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Yeah, last week's show was long because we had an almost additional segment of the show just about the evil G shenanigans.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:58.000
It was something else, and really good discussion last week.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:04.000
An impromptu appearance from Dan in the middle of that discussion, who was on the front lines for some time. It was good.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:08.000
What'd you think of all that, though? Surely you have an opinion.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Coming from somebody who has worked in retail and for big chain companies, I strongly believe that Square Enix didn't do anything wrong.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:25.000
The big G is just butthurt, and they're blowing smoke up people's asses.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:37.000
I don't know. I do think it was in bad form for Squeenix to spring that on people, and I think GameStop had the right to know what was in that box and choose not to sell it.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:47.000
And, you know, as I said, I don't want to repeat myself from last week, but as I said, the correct answer was what they finally did too late was just push the game back to Squeenix and refuse to sell it.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:50.000
If they'd just done that to begin with, there wouldn't have been a problem.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:56.000
To be perfectly honest, I do not believe the whole 48 hours thing.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Now, during my time working in these big chain companies, when companies like Square, Nintendo, and everybody else, when they're going to do something like that, they send a notice out.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Usually about two to three weeks prior before do this.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:23.000
So, I really believe that the big G knew about this, but they were just waiting what to do, what to do.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:33.000
So, I feel that they decide, oh, let's wait about this time, pull the code out, and just start all of this.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Part of it could have been a publicity stunt, which I find hard to, but from my retail experience, I don't believe that they just found out two days prior.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Because if I'm sick of not understanding how any other chain had an issue with it, you know what I'm saying?

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:52.000
It does seem like the memo went out to pull those codes really early on.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Like, you know, I don't know, I don't know.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:58.000
But what do you think, though, did you buy Deus Ex on PC out of curiosity?

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
No.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Okay, let's assume you had.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Yes.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Do you think you would have used that coupon for OnLive?

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Probably not, no.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:21.000
I kind of theorized that I don't think that coupon's really that big a deal, because I think people are going to go use it to kind of check out OnLive and go, ooh, that's kind of neat, and play it for five minutes, and then be done with it, because the games don't really tie.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:27.000
It's not like, I don't know, Portal or something. I don't know, it's not as rich as that kind of connection.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:33.000
But it was just the whole thought that, oh my gosh, you're taking out a $50 coupon.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:41.000
And here's another thing, remember Valve did the same thing, I don't remember the big G having an issue with it.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:46.000
I don't believe the whole spin on how they had this agreement with Valve, you know?

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Because to be perfectly honest, let's say Square Enix says, oh, because of this, we're no longer selling our products to you.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:02.000
And you know, since Square Enix is one of the big players out there, it would not surprise me if other manufacturers were like, you know?

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:10.000
But that's a note, I don't think it's as easy as that, because, you know, Evil G, or as I like to call him, the Evil Genus.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:18.000
The Evil Genus has a huge hold on, you know, the share of the games that they push through is gigantic.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:25.000
True, but I prefer to call them gazpacho stop.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
I'm sure we could sit here and think of names all day.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I know.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Alright, alright. Do you have any other thoughts you want to get out before we let you go and get more calls?

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
I've said my thoughts, and one more thing.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Yes.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Now, whenever they do these price drops, and I know on one episode Arrow was questioning about the whole DS price drop thing.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:55.000
By consumer law, if there is a price drop within 30 days of the price, wherever you bought it from, by law, they have to give you the difference.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000
State or federal.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:57.000
State or federal.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:58.000
What?

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:03.000
There's no if, ands, or buts about it. If there's a price drop within 30 days, they have to give you the difference.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.000
State or federal law.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:05.000
They don't.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.000
That doesn't sound like a law at all.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
That could be a state.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
It's consumer law. It's one of the things I had to learn about.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:14.000
But is that consumer law for New York, or is it for federal?

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:17.000
That might be the deal, Rama. It might be, because I've never heard of that here either.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Well, I do know it's New York state law. Also, same thing in Jersey, Connecticut, and a bunch of other states.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:30.000
It would not surprise me if it was a federal law, but you know how some people do that whole federal law dance thing.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:34.000
It's one of those things we don't get out here on the West Coast, like hurricanes.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Which I slept through, by the way.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:45.000
I heard a lot of people did, but I don't mean to make light of a bad situation, because unfortunately, people in Vermont did not fare as well as people in New York City, from what I understand.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Pretty much.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Hope everybody's alright.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Alright, we're gonna let you go, Rama.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Thank you.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Alright, take care, buddy.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Alright, bye.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Bye.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Alright, I want to go to this aside real quick before we take another call. We've got more calls coming in, but I want to do this real quick.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Because we were talking about scary games earlier, and several people in the chatroom brought up Amnesia.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:09.000
And here's the thing, though. The story of The Dark Soccer Road was about 360 games, and Amnesia is a PC-only game.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:12.000
However, it goes without saying that Amnesia is a pretty scary game.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:16.000
And Salacious Pop has been telling me about reaction videos on YouTube.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
This is a big thing people like to do on YouTube, is reaction videos.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Like, I'm sure we've all seen, like, Grandma Watches Two Girls One Cup for the First Time reaction videos, right?

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:28.000
But apparently there's reaction video of, like, frat boys playing Amnesia.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Well, I asked Salacious Pop to go find me some.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:35.000
So, I've never seen these. This could be a horrible statement.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.000
But I want to try playing one of these on air here.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000
So, this is, um...

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.000
What is this called here?

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000
I don't want your stupid advertisement. Let me get through the advertisement.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.000
This is Funny Freakouts here, to Amnesia.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.000
So, let me, um, get to this.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.000
And, uh, let's see.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
A Funtage, I guess they're calling this.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
I want to get to... He says a minute thirty-three.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
So, let me start it there.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Oh, shit!

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Shut up, shut up!

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.000
In there, in there!

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Jump in, jump in! Close the door! Close the door! Close the door!

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Close the door! Close the door!

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Fuck!

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
No! Don't think!

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:32.000
Don't be crouched, crouched, crouched. Don't just...

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Really carefully, carefully, guys.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Oh my god!

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Shut up!

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Oh, oh, Jesus Christ!

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Oh, Jesus Christ!

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:43.000
No! No! Run! Run! Run!

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Run! Where do I go?

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
I hide in there! I hide over here!

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:50.000
I love you!

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Jesus!

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Run!

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:04.000
See, that's the problem, is that when you do 360 only games, you can't include amnesia.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
I don't want to pay twenty bucks for that.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Oh, I have amnesia. You should come over, and we should make a reaction video to amnesia.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:13.000
Because we'll both scream like twelve-year-old girls, we will.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.000
I want it, but I don't want to pay twenty bucks for it.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
I have it. You should come over one night.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Like, we could do this on Halloween.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Okay.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:25.000
I was, I, who was I, were we talking about this at breakfast, or was I talking about with Salacious Pop?

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:26.000
I'm getting old, I forget things.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.000
We were talking about it this morning.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:31.000
We were talking about it at breakfast, because, uh, we were talking about Castlevania, or something.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Yeah.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:35.000
And I was like, no, we gotta play something really scary, we gotta play amnesia.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Which I have yet to, I bought it, but I haven't played it yet.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:40.000
So, like, you'd get some genuine reactions out of me.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Okay, I'll do that, I'll be down for that.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:53.000
We might have to have an OLR Halloween special, kind of like, like Nickelodeon would do the Mark Summers Halloween mansion or whatever.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:58.000
We'll have to do Amnesia Night with Dark Sakura, Rob Roberts, and maybe Loki.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.000
You hear?

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
You know when I scream when my voice goes away?

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Salacious Pop, be quiet.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Alright.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Let's get to some more calls.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
We've made these people wait through amnesia reaction videos.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:13.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Hey, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto, can you hear me?

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Yes, we can. Hi, Kaijuto, what's up?

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Hey, not much, I just wanted to tell you, Rob, last week you spoke about the game Covert Action.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Yes, Sid Meier's Covert Action.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Yeah, that was actually a favorite game.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
And that's the CIA calling you right now.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Hello?

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Hi, we can hear you.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Okay, anyway, that was a favorite game of mine, too, and I found it about three years ago.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:47.000
You can play it for free online on the PC, and also, you might like this, you'll be able to play it on your Nintendo DS.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:48.000
What?

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:49.000
If you have an R4 card.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.000
What?

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:51.000
I actually play it while I'm in the bathroom.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:54.000
What?

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Doing some espionage of your own.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where I do my best work, man.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:04.000
So yeah, if you have an R4 card, it's really simple, I'm pretty sure Loki can help you out.

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:12.000
You get the R4 card, you get the Covert Action ROM somewhere online where you can find it, and then there's like some type of application.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:16.000
I think it, because I have a few of them on my R4, so I don't know which one it is.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:26.000
I think it's the Apple II emulator that you can put on your DS with the R4 that gives you the Covert Action, or it might be one of the others, but it's really easy to find.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Wow.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Interesting.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:30.000
I don't have an R4 cartridge.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.000
I have a spare R4.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:34.000
I'm saying maybe Loki will let me borrow one of his.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.000
That's awesome.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:36.000
I loved Covert Action.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.000
I don't know what it is about that game either.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Dude, Sid Meier, he's the man.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
He's just, he's played so many good games.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
And he doesn't like that game for some reason.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:49.000
I think you mentioned yesterday, people said that it was like too many games in one.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Sid Meier, that was actually Sid Meier said that they tried to do too much in one game.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:41:05.000
It was like four separate games that none of them were really fully realized, and you know, and to be fair, the driving game was always kind of dumb anyway.

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Like the best part was the actual one where you broke in to the facilities, and then there was the cryptogram, that's really easy, and then the switchboard puzzles, the logic puzzles.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:18.000
For the record, Civ V is on sale for 75% off right now.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
At the top of the show, where were you?

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Not listening because I don't play Civ, but I'm repeating it.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Alright, fair enough. It's worth repeating.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:31.000
And my favorite part of the game was the fact that you can play it over and over again.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:39.000
Like there's always like some type of game tree that you can follow that's never the same kind of like choose your own adventure looks.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:42.000
And that's what I liked about it the most, but definitely check it out.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:47.000
And the cool thing is that when you play the, remember the little top-down game where you're like running through the building?

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Yeah, that part was like the best.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Yeah, that, with this hack on the DS, you could actually use the direction pad to play that version of the game.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:03.000
Now, ActDeftInChat says piracy lounge radio. No, no, I legit own this game back in the day, thank you very much.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:09.000
And just to let them know, the game is officially free online. It's not like you're pirating the game.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.000
There's somewhere where they provide it to you for free.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:20.000
And also the Apple II emulator is just a free application for the R4, so it's not really any piracy going on.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Nice.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
This is all just like freeware that's available to you.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Oh, this just occurred to me. You know what covert action is like? It's like where in the world is Carmen Sandiego with guns?

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Okay, this game looks awesome.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Oh, it's Cthulhu Saves the World.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Yeah, I've never played it.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Yeah, those are on Xbox Live in the marketplace.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.000
I'm going to hang up and let you get to your next call.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Thank you for being courteous, Kaijuto. That's very nice of you. Take care, buddy.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death 7 are three bucks.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Yeah, I want to say there was a story one week. I don't remember how long ago.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:43:01.000
They sold more on Steam of those games in one weekend than they did the entire time the game was on Xbox Live in the arcade.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Wow.

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:05.000
But of course, the games are really cheap. They're fun. They're cute.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.000
They're definitely a throwback to the old school Super Nintendo RPGs with humor.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.000
I like the Cthulhu one because Cthulhu is cute.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:17.000
So you have to check. Did you ever see Hello Cthulhu? Yes, I have.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
It's like the Hello Kitty doll, but it's Cthulhu.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Well, it's it's actually Cthulhu ending up in the Sanrio universe and corrupting Hello Kitty.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.000
They personally did like a few of them, but they're super funny.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Would that look like the Hello Kitty in the Ursula outfit doll that I bought Salacious Pop?

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:38.000
No, it's just a super cute Cthulhu, like a little SD Sanrio-style Cthulhu hanging out with a goth-doubt kitty.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.000
I still really want you to have your World of Warcraft character named Ursulol.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Well, maybe I'll remake Fatty Cakes into Ursulol, but Fatty Cakes is a good name, too.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:48.000
I'll make Ursulol.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:51.000
All right, let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange and Orange Radio. Who's this?

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Legend is off of you.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Pretty good, as usual.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Good, good. What's up?

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:13.000
I guess what I wanted to bring up was the fact that Activision is kind of like trying to get the folks currently on the fence like myself from Modern Warfare 3 on the PC by just like re-adding things that they took out.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Case in point, LAN support, in addition to adding dedicated servers.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:27.000
So it's like, I don't know, on one hand, they're trying to make amends, but on the other, you know, I have to believe it has to be like a bait and switch.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:31.000
Interesting, because I remember hearing that they took it out, but I did not hear about them putting it back in.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
That was for Modern Warfare 2.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
Interesting.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Yeah, so Modern Warfare 3 will actually have LAN support.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Well, you know, Blizzard is a huge part of Activision, obviously, and they've come under fire lately because, what, Starcraft 2 does not have the LAN, and Diablo 3 is not going to have it either.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Yeah, they're all going to be online for better or for worse.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:58.000
I hate to say it, but I sort of support it with Diablo 3. I don't know.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Here's the thing, like, the thing with Diablo 3 is that, let's face it, Diablo 2 was hacked to hell and back, and it, like, you can't play that game online with strangers.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:09.000
It's so broken. You can really only play with people you trust.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:16.000
I think if they had kept, like, a LAN campaign separate from an online campaign, they could have done it, you know?

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:20.000
It's kind of disappointing, but, eh, there's always Torchlight 2.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Well, that does help.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:26.000
The $20 price tag that was confirmed this week helps, too.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Right now, I guess I could, I'll probably give them the benefit of the doubt, but seeing that this is Activision and the fact that they reneged on it back in Modern Warfare 2, when they promised that they were going to have dedicated servers and so forth, only to find out a few weeks before launch that it was quite the opposite.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Right.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:50.000
So I don't want to, it's like, I don't want to get fooled again.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Um, what did you think of the whole Call of Duty expo that they did, the Call of Duty XP or whatever?

02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:01.000
I heard bits and pieces, like, people actually doing paintball matches to some of the maps in there.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:09.000
I mean, it's like, I guess they're trying to hype it up to the point where, you know, it's all marketing at this point.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:28.000
I mean, the idea is that Call of Duty is for, you know, quote unquote, kind of like the douchebags game of choice in that regard, whereas Battlefield 3 is mostly for the hardcore, the hardcore nerd gamer that plays these types of FPSs like Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:34.000
That's the type of, that's the type of demographic I see EA targeting, you know, with BF3.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Right.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:45.000
Whereas Call of Duty is kind of like the dumbed down, basic, um, that's like the one that they're trying to get everyone on board with.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:48.000
It was like a frat boy type game.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:53.000
I know I'm generalizing and you can, you know, you can sue me if you want, but I'm just...

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:54.000
No, it's fine.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:01.000
I'm so uneducated on all those games and it's not that I dislike them, they're just not my thing and I'm stuck at them.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:02.000
I'm so terrible at them.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:09.000
It's like some people in DDR, some people think DDR is just, what the hell is that music that's coming out of that machine, you know, and not everybody gets it.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Right, right, but I mean, I guess what Activision is banking on is the mere fact that they can sell a shitload of copies of that game, of Modern Warfare, without having to change a lot.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:35.000
And hoping that, you know, as long as you hype it up to the point where they kind of need to have it or else they're going to be the, you know, the unluckiest kid in the block without their copy of Call of Duty.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:48.000
It's kind of like they're trying to create a mindset where you have to one-up your friend or your neighbors and get, you know, and covet that copy of Call of Duty that he has.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Whereas Battlefield 3, on the other hand, is going for more detail, more replay, more, let's just say, a lot more features than what Activision is offering.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Let's be real.

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Actually, it's aiming towards being a simulator.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Let's be real.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:07.000
A military simulator.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Let's be real. Aren't most people just going to get both?

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:16.000
Yeah, you're right, they're going to get both, but I could see a lot of those, you know, uneducated, regular token gamers.

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:19.000
They're going to just get Modern Warfare 3.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Like the really hardcore ones, they're going to get both.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:25.000
They're going to balance time in between the two.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Yeah.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:30.000
It's kind of like there's so much I want to play this holiday season.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Well, isn't that the case every holiday?

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Somehow I will have to juggle my time between Skyrim, Diablo 3, Torchlight 2, and God knows it all, I'm forgetting, the Mario Kart on the 3DS.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:44.000
I thought Diablo 3 wasn't coming out this year.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:45.000
I think it will.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:51.000
They haven't said one way or the other, but the friends and family beta is going on right now, which means the public beta is probably next month.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:55.000
I think they're going to announce at BlizzCon that it's coming out within the next month.

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:58.000
Why wouldn't they try to make End of Year and have a huge thing?

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:01.000
Because Blizzard hasn't released anything else this year.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:04.000
They don't release Diablo, they've released nothing.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:10.000
And they still have to get the expansion pack for Starcraft 2, which is probably next year anyways.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:11.000
That's probably next year.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Actually, I didn't make the show world, but there was a story, Blizzard has committed to six games in familiar IPs over the next three years.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:28.000
And most people are speculating that's the two Starcraft 2, Diablo 3 and an expansion, and two WoW expansions.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
That's it?

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:31.000
Which makes sense.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:36.000
And most of them are going to, and pretty much all of them are going to be on PC unless they do like second hand ports.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:41.000
I guarantee Diablo 3 will end up on consoles, it's just not going to be the same time as PC.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Yeah, and this is why you always want to, with Blizzard it's always PC or nothing.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:55.000
People forget, Diablo was on the Playstation, Starcraft was on the 64, well some things are better left forgotten.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Yeah, some things are better left forgotten than Blizzard's half-assed ports of their properties back in the day.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
Warcraft comes to mind.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:10.000
It's been 15 years since Diablo on the Playstation 1, so you know, it's worth a try.

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:13.000
See, I enjoyed it on my PC, enough said.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show and have fun.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Alright, take care buddy.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Have a good one.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:24.000
I think he's going to be broke this holiday season too, I forgot to ask him how much money he plans to spend.

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
Alright, sadly that's going to do it for the Skyplan.

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.000
I want someone with money to get me a Moonkin hatchling.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
They're what, 10 bucks?

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:32.000
Yeah.

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Not too bad. But it's virtual pets.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:37.000
I know. That's what I said, I want someone else to get it.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:40.000
How about I donate $10 to a charity in your honor?

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:41.000
Okay.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Alright.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:43.000
Dude, what the hell?

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:47.000
Alright, moving on, I want to finish up the tweet so we can finish up the show tonight.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
We just had a handful of other tweets.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:54.000
An interesting one from Tigerclaw, tweeting OLR at twitter.com slash OLR.

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:59.000
Study suggests virtual goods purchasing differs by ethnicity.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:06.000
Oh boy, this could be a, alright, let's see what this is all about.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:12.000
This is a report for, this is an article from Gamasutra that we were linked to on twitter by user Tigerclaw305.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:20.000
New study published Friday by mobile game community MocoSpace suggests that virtual goods purchasing behavior may be affected by ethnicity.

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:29.000
A survey of anonymous data from 40,000 mobile social gamers revealed that both Caucasians and African Americans over indexed on virtual goods spendings.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:38.000
Caucasians in particular were responsible for 26% of virtual goods purchases made during the study period, despite representing only 18% of those studied.

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:44.000
African Americans made up 36% of the respondents and made 38% of the purchases.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Those calling those Hispanic under indexed despite compromising 31% of the sample pool, they made only 21% of the purchases.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Alright, what does this all mean? You know, numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers. What does this mean?

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:04.000
According to MocoSpace CEO Justin Siegel, the rapid growth of virtual goods industry means that it, quote, makes sense to really start segmenting it.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Quote, we've started to sort our data by a number of criteria, including ethnicity and gender.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:22.000
Over time, this sort of information will change how mobile game developers and publishers create content and market their titles, something that already happening in console and online gaming industry.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:34.000
I'm not really understanding, like, how, but whatever. People get paid to break that data down, just so you know. Somebody got paid to do that study.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:42.000
Last tweet to us tonight from WatchDragon. Beat Space Marine on hard. What is Space Marine? Is that just Halo?

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:45.000
No, it's Warhammer 4K Space Marine.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Aha! That would explain the rest of this tweet. I play the tabletop Warhammer. It's true to the story and fluff.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:59.000
And fluff. Very cool. Thank you for educating me, Loki, because I did not pick that up.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:05.000
I did not play Warhammer tabletop. The only Warhammer I've ever played was that MMO they put out a couple years ago.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
You played Warhammer tabletop, didn't you, Darkseid?

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
Hell no. I dated someone who did.

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:10.000
Oh, that's-

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:11.000
So sick of those stupid little-

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:15.000
Oh, you had figurine trauma in that relationship.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:16.000
Yes, because-

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:20.000
I tried playing Warhammer 4K Space Marine.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Did you?

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:32.000
Warhammer 4K Space Marine was more of the larger scale battles, smaller scale figurines. The actual Space Marines were 6mm tall figurines.

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:38.000
I did not paint those. I tried painting them and I'm like, fuck that. It's too damn small.

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:39.000
Alright.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:43.000
And I threw it all away. Because I'm like, I don't get this game.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:48.000
I haven't played Dungeons and Dragons in like four years. I should play some time. I don't know. I just sound like a total nerd.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Maybe I didn't throw it away. I think I might have it in a box somewhere.

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:58.000
Alright. That does it for Twitter topics tonight. Tweet us for next week. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:01.000
Let's go to Loki and see if he has any last minute stories.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:07.000
Um, just real quick. Rookies won't appear in NBA 2K12 until lockout's over.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:11.000
So, there's gonna be an update or something like that for free once-

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:12.000
Lockouts are ruining everything.

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Once that happens, you won't be able to play as, you know, till it happens you won't be able to play as the rookies.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Um, there's some mysterious move game in development from the people that did Linker in Shadows.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Remember that really weird dog flying thing with the basset hound and the shadow creatures that look like the squid from The Matrix or whatever?

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Actually, I don't remember that and it's probably for the best.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:42.000
Probably is kinda artsy. Um, so now they have a teaser, uh, trailer thing on YouTube.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:47.000
I don't even know if it's really a teaser, but it's a thing called the Odd Forest.

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:54.000
And it basically looks like some sort of move game where you're interacting with objects by touching them and stuff.

02:54:54.000 --> 02:55:05.000
I would almost go and say, you know, they could very well be like trying to put some sort of, you know, touch sensitive glove or something in play.

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Cause it's almost like all this stuff is just, you know, focusing on the textures of different things and obviously with the movie you're not gonna be able to feel any of that.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:19.000
So, I don't know. But right now, weird video that's online so you can check it out.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:24.000
And that's pretty much it.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:29.000
Alright, well this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:32.000
So, Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. Your final thought tonight?

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
Duffy.

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:41.000
My final thought tonight is tacos! Again. And baking cupcakes causing sugar headaches.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
Those cupcakes single-handedly are gonna make me diabetic.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:44.000
I have a sugar headache right now.

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:48.000
I know, right? That's why I ran to get water during one of the reports. Crazy.

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:51.000
Anyway, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:57.000
My final thought is I made a flamethrower in Grand Theft Auto. And no one else has.

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
And happy birthday once again.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:00.000
Thank you.

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
So, hope you had a good one.
