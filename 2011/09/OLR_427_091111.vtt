00:46.961 --> 00:58.926
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to hear the stream, hopefully you're already on the stream, but I'll say it for the sake of the podcast listeners, you can tune in Sunday nights, www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

00:59.366 --> 01:02.492
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

01:02.672 --> 01:05.938
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:06.298 --> 01:06.338
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

01:06.599 --> 01:07.180
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you, Ms.

01:07.220 --> 01:07.500
[SPEAKER_10]: Summers?

01:08.129 --> 01:08.469
[SPEAKER_07]: Hungry.

01:08.870 --> 01:09.530
[SPEAKER_10]: You're hungry?

01:09.790 --> 01:13.012
[SPEAKER_10]: But it looks like you're eating over there, so you're getting that hunger problem fixed, right?

01:13.072 --> 01:13.293
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:13.713 --> 01:14.694
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very nutritious.

01:15.174 --> 01:16.015
[SPEAKER_10]: Nutritious, delicious?

01:16.175 --> 01:18.857
[SPEAKER_07]: It's brown rice and tempeh with okonomiyaki sauce.

01:18.957 --> 01:20.197
[SPEAKER_10]: I love brown rice and vegetables.

01:21.678 --> 01:21.979
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

01:23.019 --> 01:23.840
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worse than dog food.

01:25.041 --> 01:25.681
[SPEAKER_10]: Dog-a-chow.

01:26.782 --> 01:29.664
[SPEAKER_10]: Also say hello to the one, the only, Tech Master, Loki!

01:29.804 --> 01:30.044
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

01:30.364 --> 01:31.025
[SPEAKER_10]: And how are you, Loki?

01:31.625 --> 01:32.186
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fine.

01:32.486 --> 01:36.709
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, to answer the question in our chat room, what did you get for dinner tonight?

01:38.403 --> 01:45.770
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, well, I got another double bacon western burger, but I'm not even really that hungry.

01:45.830 --> 01:50.094
[SPEAKER_09]: But I figured, you know, if I don't eat something, I'm going to be hungry later because I had a big lunch, but it was around 1.

01:50.134 --> 01:59.202
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, if I don't eat anything between 1 o'clock and, you know, 11 o'clock or whatever, I'll probably be starving by 11.

02:00.601 --> 02:12.037
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I had to hold me over for tonight's show is a Frappuccino That's the food I had this week But I will be getting something more substantial after the show Hey, it's pumpkin spice Frappuccino, it's really good

02:12.785 --> 02:14.966
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is your kick with pumpkin spice lately?

02:15.166 --> 02:16.107
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my favorite time of year.

02:16.127 --> 02:16.727
[SPEAKER_10]: I love pumpkin.

02:16.747 --> 02:17.547
[SPEAKER_10]: I love pumpkin pie.

02:17.968 --> 02:19.208
[SPEAKER_10]: They have pumpkin Pop-Tarts now.

02:19.748 --> 02:24.211
[SPEAKER_10]: And oh my gosh, oh my gosh, they now make Hershey's Kisses that are pumpkin spice flavored.

02:24.751 --> 02:26.872
[SPEAKER_10]: It's heaven.

02:27.592 --> 02:28.253
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

02:29.113 --> 02:30.293
[SPEAKER_10]: And they don't pay me to say that.

02:30.374 --> 02:31.434
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is that good.

02:31.754 --> 02:34.616
[SPEAKER_07]: Or to quote Rob from WOW last night, it tastes like world peace.

02:34.636 --> 02:35.696
[SPEAKER_10]: It did taste like world peace.

02:36.076 --> 02:39.438
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we do have a guest on tonight's show, at least going to join us for at least the first half here.

02:39.818 --> 02:40.438
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:56.790 --> 03:00.831
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay to use it for Orange Lounge Radio because that's how people know me here.

03:01.332 --> 03:04.853
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand your nickname.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.153
[SPEAKER_10]: When does Prince want to be Prince?

03:06.233 --> 03:06.993
[SPEAKER_10]: He's always Prince.

03:07.233 --> 03:08.334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm like Prince 2.0.

03:09.754 --> 03:11.095
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back to the show, Rice Princess.

03:11.375 --> 03:11.815
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

03:12.535 --> 03:13.575
[SPEAKER_10]: What's new in your world?

03:14.656 --> 03:19.277
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me have you reintroduce yourself for those that are newer to Orange Lounge Radio who weren't here 100 episodes ago.

03:19.637 --> 03:21.038
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a gamer girl, obviously.

03:22.278 --> 03:23.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.

03:23.599 --> 03:24.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.

03:24.579 --> 03:24.999
[SPEAKER_06]: I've kind of

03:25.734 --> 03:27.295
[SPEAKER_10]: What, you don't play games anymore?

03:27.555 --> 03:27.995
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought you did.

03:28.015 --> 03:31.157
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that I'm not interested in playing games, I just don't have time.

03:32.478 --> 03:33.659
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would if I could.

03:33.819 --> 03:34.940
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been playing anything lately?

03:35.700 --> 03:35.920
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

03:36.421 --> 03:36.761
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

03:37.801 --> 03:38.302
[SPEAKER_06]: Not, no.

03:38.662 --> 03:42.684
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought you and your boyfriend had a Wii and at least were playing stuff on that, or is it mostly him?

03:43.725 --> 03:44.606
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mostly him.

03:44.866 --> 03:50.209
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a Gamefly account and he'll get games and then I'll watch him play them, but I just don't have the energy to play anything.

03:50.229 --> 03:51.110
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then get off the show.

03:51.130 --> 03:51.690
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

03:52.451 --> 03:54.692
[SPEAKER_10]: But you do love your classic games at least, right?

03:55.311 --> 03:57.113
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

04:11.289 --> 04:12.110
[SPEAKER_06]: Your favorites.

04:12.270 --> 04:14.231
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my favorite is Chrono Trigger.

04:15.691 --> 04:16.832
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy Tactics.

04:18.192 --> 04:19.573
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty close to Chrono Trigger.

04:21.494 --> 04:22.214
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Metroid.

04:22.614 --> 04:27.777
[SPEAKER_06]: Just really from the Super Nintendo era, most of the games on the Super Nintendo.

04:27.797 --> 04:29.237
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Nintendo was just perfect gaming, wasn't it?

04:29.257 --> 04:30.738
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the golden system.

04:30.838 --> 04:31.939
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was.

04:32.099 --> 04:33.019
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree in many ways.

04:33.159 --> 04:35.060
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if gaming will ever be that good ever again.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.041
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaming is just different now.

04:37.521 --> 04:38.464
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it just is.

04:38.544 --> 04:41.993
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially a game I was playing this week that I'll get into later in my gaming week.

04:42.595 --> 04:44.159
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like interacting with a movie now.

04:44.239 --> 04:44.400
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not...

04:46.604 --> 04:47.844
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's not a bad thing.

04:48.385 --> 04:54.226
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, you know, and maybe this is a little bit of get off my lawn syndrome, but it's just not the same like it was.

04:54.526 --> 05:05.270
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, you know, okay, so if you have been listening for a while, you know that I hate Microsoft and like the Xbox systems that they have, but we actually ended up buying one.

05:05.790 --> 05:08.911
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I finally allowed my boyfriend to have one in the house.

05:08.951 --> 05:14.173
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is a huge deal because when you were on the show before, you were very staunch anti-Microsoft, anti-Xbox.

05:14.233 --> 05:14.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but...

05:16.388 --> 05:17.149
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what?

05:17.389 --> 05:17.989
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I am.

05:18.129 --> 05:19.810
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I just mean console-wise.

05:19.950 --> 05:21.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't like Microsoft.

05:22.332 --> 05:23.953
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Wii is a piece of shit.

05:24.193 --> 05:26.434
[SPEAKER_06]: The PS3 is way too much, and they don't have any good games.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.016
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just, he really wanted one, and I'm like, fine.

05:29.136 --> 05:31.277
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I can't hold them back any longer.

05:31.297 --> 05:35.559
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to admit that it's probably the best system out right now, console-wise.

05:35.940 --> 05:41.703
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we get games on that console, I really feel like an idiot, like a retard.

05:41.763 --> 05:43.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

05:43.504 --> 05:51.548
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all first person shooter controls and you kind of have to go to game college to learn the controls on these games.

05:51.608 --> 05:52.188
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

05:52.308 --> 05:54.689
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to go back and just play Puzzle Fighter HD Turbo all day?

05:54.729 --> 05:57.030
[SPEAKER_06]: I want two buttons on my controller, god damn it.

05:57.351 --> 06:00.792
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tired of all this stupid bullshit.

06:01.673 --> 06:07.175
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it just takes a little bit more effort to learn how to play a game, but I don't know.

06:07.315 --> 06:08.196
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the games are pretty good.

06:08.216 --> 06:11.497
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here on the show tonight?

06:11.557 --> 06:12.878
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually our guests want to plug something.

06:14.089 --> 06:14.850
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not really.

06:15.350 --> 06:15.610
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

06:15.810 --> 06:16.831
[SPEAKER_06]: Thought I'd offer.

06:17.011 --> 06:17.851
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, it's fine.

06:17.911 --> 06:18.372
Yeah.

06:18.872 --> 06:19.152
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

06:19.712 --> 06:23.094
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you'll be joining us throughout the show and offer your witty insight and commentary.

06:23.194 --> 06:23.594
[SPEAKER_10]: Please do.

06:24.095 --> 06:24.335
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

06:24.495 --> 06:25.875
[SPEAKER_10]: As we continue on throughout tonight's show.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.196
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura wants her mic back.

06:27.516 --> 06:28.977
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like your Avengers t-shirt.

06:31.178 --> 06:31.779
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

06:33.909 --> 06:35.550
[SPEAKER_07]: I just looked over and saw Ms.

06:35.590 --> 06:36.670
[SPEAKER_07]: Marvel and it made me happy.

06:58.001 --> 07:21.732
[SPEAKER_10]: I was fortunate when I was 17 years old I got to go to the Trade Center and I have a very vivid memory of being on the roof of the Trade Center but I drove by it with a big hole in it oh and you it was right after the bottom floor got bombed oh gosh when I was 17 wow and it's just you know the whole thing watching on a phone TV was just just just so difficult and everything and

07:22.152 --> 07:37.413
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know we have a lot of listeners in New York City and back east and all those places that we're affected and it's like you know the impact we felt 3,000 miles away I can't even imagine just that experience so you know we should never forget what happened

07:37.993 --> 07:38.694
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

07:54.951 --> 08:19.715
[SPEAKER_10]: uh if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise you wouldn't feel it no she wouldn't i do pet her with my foot though so i don't have to bend over as i was saying if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise kind of a tough day for some people uh then i think we've done our job so and uh fuck terrorists like seriously fuck them they suck so if we do what we do then they don't get it we can commemorate something else today

08:20.134 --> 08:20.674
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

08:20.794 --> 08:25.977
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on because something else monumental happened today, 31 years ago.

08:26.498 --> 08:27.258
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what that is?

08:28.219 --> 08:29.540
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki was born, everybody.

08:29.580 --> 08:30.940
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Loki's birthday.

08:31.481 --> 08:32.081
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

08:32.121 --> 08:33.582
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy birthday, Loki.

08:34.402 --> 08:42.787
[SPEAKER_10]: So in commemoration, it looks like Irene has actually brought over some bacon cupcakes for Loki.

08:42.827 --> 08:43.148
[SPEAKER_10]: I love this.

08:43.168 --> 08:44.328
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you get a picture up on the website?

08:44.348 --> 08:44.588
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did.

08:44.949 --> 08:45.249
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

08:45.869 --> 08:47.630
[SPEAKER_07]: They should be on orangejonesradio.com.

08:47.730 --> 08:48.310
[SPEAKER_07]: Go look at it now.

08:48.350 --> 08:49.270
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll eat them later.

08:49.430 --> 08:50.271
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't eat them right now.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.311
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm too full from the other bacon stuff.

08:54.032 --> 08:55.052
[SPEAKER_09]: I really shouldn't have eaten that.

08:55.112 --> 08:55.773
[SPEAKER_09]: It was too much.

08:55.793 --> 09:00.394
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, milkshake or bacon burger.

09:00.414 --> 09:01.495
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, bacon burger.

09:02.755 --> 09:03.795
[SPEAKER_09]: Should have gone for the milkshake.

09:04.076 --> 09:07.997
[SPEAKER_10]: So, any good video game related loot for your birthday or not yet?

09:08.417 --> 09:08.617
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

09:09.237 --> 09:10.258
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, someone...

09:12.039 --> 09:13.460
[SPEAKER_09]: I really hate not remembering.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.783
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone gifted me an Xbox Live code last night.

09:18.384 --> 09:22.948
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get to check what it was for yet.

09:23.668 --> 09:24.569
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

09:26.671 --> 09:28.092
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have to check that out.

09:28.272 --> 09:28.812
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see...

09:32.352 --> 09:33.934
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to look up real quick.

09:33.994 --> 09:39.059
[SPEAKER_09]: Ryan Belknap gifted me something from Xbox Live.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.603
[SPEAKER_09]: I will go check that out, and I really appreciate it.

09:42.723 --> 09:45.666
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't really get on my Xbox today.

09:45.706 --> 09:48.089
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, last night sucked.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.972
[SPEAKER_09]: My cat was being an asshole, so I didn't get it.

09:51.172 --> 09:53.795
[SPEAKER_09]: Heartland-y sleep, like maybe a few hours.

09:54.715 --> 10:07.604
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, he just, today I ended up sleeping in and then it was like out to lunch and then came back and started messing with Grand Theft Auto stuff, so didn't get a chance to boot it back up again, but, oh well.

10:08.125 --> 10:11.507
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I hope your birthday is awesome and, uh, congratulations.

10:11.727 --> 10:12.028
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

10:12.248 --> 10:20.013
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all, we're all in our 30s now, so, uh, it's the, it's the podcast, oh, not, not, uh, Irene, but Chloe, you're just, you're just visiting tonight.

10:20.774 --> 10:23.296
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, we're now the podcast for those in their mid-30s.

10:24.767 --> 10:25.088
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

10:25.629 --> 10:26.049
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

10:26.230 --> 10:27.993
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand what's hip and cool nowadays.

10:28.013 --> 10:29.616
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for Toy Trends.

10:29.776 --> 10:31.058
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand that crap.

10:31.219 --> 10:38.191
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're just making all sorts of weird shit up now and kids are just buying it and I don't get it.

10:39.113 --> 10:39.613
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

10:40.554 --> 10:46.178
[SPEAKER_07]: When kids are maybe about one and a half and younger, they don't care.

10:47.279 --> 10:51.142
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll play with the box, save some money, and buy them a box.

10:51.182 --> 10:56.425
[SPEAKER_10]: I seem to recall Josh, your kid, really loved the Kinect calibration card.

10:56.465 --> 10:56.906
[SPEAKER_10]: Still does.

10:58.687 --> 10:59.327
[SPEAKER_10]: For real.

10:59.387 --> 11:00.688
[SPEAKER_10]: The wacky, creepy, happy face.

11:00.728 --> 11:01.429
[SPEAKER_07]: Babies are like cats.

11:03.737 --> 11:06.918
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go buy the most expensive cat toy ever, but they don't care.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.998
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to play with the twist ties and the box.

11:09.019 --> 11:11.019
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you drop them from six feet, they'll land on all fours?

11:11.479 --> 11:11.619
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

11:12.499 --> 11:13.280
[SPEAKER_07]: I said they're light cats.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.340
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't say they were cats.

11:15.820 --> 11:19.061
[SPEAKER_07]: And besides that, it's not like they have clear vision until they're, you know, ten months old anyway.

11:19.361 --> 11:23.923
[SPEAKER_09]: It is pretty true that they do like all sorts of random stuff.

11:24.123 --> 11:28.344
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually, I mean, he'll chase after sunlight on the floor.

11:30.222 --> 11:31.749
[SPEAKER_09]: So pretty much anything amuses him.

11:32.753 --> 11:33.758
[SPEAKER_07]: Save money, everybody.

11:33.979 --> 11:34.762
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't buy them toys.

11:34.883 --> 11:35.506
[SPEAKER_07]: Buy them twist ties.

11:35.967 --> 11:38.109
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm more loyal to games than systems anyway

12:03.909 --> 12:07.392
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of an interesting comment, and I see Irene shaking her head over there.

12:07.412 --> 12:08.512
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of that comment?

12:09.773 --> 12:11.394
[SPEAKER_06]: I was nodding my head.

12:12.495 --> 12:13.976
[SPEAKER_06]: Shaking it up and down, of course.

12:14.036 --> 12:14.617
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, of course.

12:16.018 --> 12:18.059
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean, I can understand that.

12:19.760 --> 12:23.943
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, really, okay, when we grew up, we only had one system in the house at a time.

12:24.003 --> 12:27.606
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have a Genesis and a Super Nintendo and all that stuff.

12:27.786 --> 12:30.608
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we all grew up in families that couldn't afford that.

12:31.403 --> 12:31.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for you.

12:32.684 --> 12:35.385
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I didn't have a Genesis and Nintendo and all that stuff at the same time.

12:35.706 --> 12:35.986
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.547
[SPEAKER_10]: I only ever had Nintendo systems.

12:37.767 --> 12:39.188
[SPEAKER_10]: I had Nintendo, Super Nintendo.

12:39.448 --> 12:41.629
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I lied because then I had a PlayStation, but I didn't have a 64, so.

12:42.310 --> 12:42.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

12:43.010 --> 12:44.111
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been pretty loyal to my Nintendo.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.251
[SPEAKER_09]: I threw away 64 one day.

12:45.352 --> 12:45.912
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

12:46.348 --> 12:52.809
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I bought it from my ex-girlfriend's brother at the time, and then I was just like, I don't want this, so I threw it away.

12:52.829 --> 12:54.770
[SPEAKER_09]: So you just threw it away.

12:54.850 --> 12:57.310
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we know who came from the richest household.

12:57.510 --> 12:57.830
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

12:57.850 --> 12:59.731
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it wasn't even, it was way late.

12:59.751 --> 13:02.711
[SPEAKER_10]: I just decided one day I didn't want it anymore, so I threw it away.

13:02.791 --> 13:03.651
[SPEAKER_10]: Carry on, carry on.

13:03.671 --> 13:05.232
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was way later.

13:05.632 --> 13:10.112
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, we're talking like in the 2000s when I bought the stupid Nintendo 64.

13:10.173 --> 13:11.453
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't, you know...

13:13.072 --> 13:15.173
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:30.098 --> 13:32.239
[SPEAKER_07]: for like my graduation deal or something.

13:32.760 --> 13:39.444
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my roommate's boyfriend left his PlayStation in the room because he didn't have a TV in my dorm room.

13:40.004 --> 13:43.546
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did have multiple systems, but it was because of circumstance.

13:46.908 --> 13:49.390
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it all goes with the golden rule of gaming.

13:49.430 --> 13:53.892
[SPEAKER_10]: Going back to the comment, you know, what we always say here on Orange Lounge Radio, system is only as good as the games that are on it.

13:54.152 --> 13:55.093
[SPEAKER_07]: Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

13:56.693 --> 14:04.880
[SPEAKER_09]: I was very much an Xbox hater for the first generation of Xbox systems, but then after that, it was just kind of alright.

14:06.201 --> 14:12.647
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when I borrowed my friend's Genesis, he had a PowerBase converter and tons of Master System games too, so...

14:14.189 --> 14:17.291
[SPEAKER_10]: I think PlayStation 3 is coming an awfully long way, too.

14:17.331 --> 14:21.494
[SPEAKER_10]: When they first came out, they were kind of the laughingstock of the industry, and for many good reasons.

14:21.574 --> 14:28.139
[SPEAKER_10]: But despite the hack earlier this year, which I still say, Microsoft isn't as invulnerable as all y'all think.

14:28.219 --> 14:31.161
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, I had $150 stolen just last month.

14:31.221 --> 14:33.002
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a follow-up on that I'm going to get to in a minute, by the way.

14:33.622 --> 14:36.484
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think PlayStation 3 is coming off a long way since then.

14:36.524 --> 14:38.365
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they've got a lot of really good stuff going for them there.

14:38.526 --> 14:42.048
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, LittleBigPlanet is one of my favorite games ever to come out this generation.

14:43.009 --> 14:43.529
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of good stuff.

14:43.989 --> 14:46.071
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, other things I want to talk about.

14:46.372 --> 14:47.993
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I'll mention the Xbox Live hack.

14:48.093 --> 14:53.358
[SPEAKER_10]: If you go back about four weeks ago on the show, I talked about how I had money stolen from my Xbox Live account.

14:53.719 --> 14:58.003
[SPEAKER_10]: Called Microsoft, was told that in 21 days they'd get the money back and whatever.

14:59.127 --> 15:12.671
[SPEAKER_10]: I got an email from them about 25 days after, it was about Wednesday, saying that they apologized for the inconvenience, but they did the investigation and that they concluded it was indeed fraudulent and I will be getting the money back on my account.

15:13.211 --> 15:18.272
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they sent me like three separate codes for one month of Xbox Live Gold.

15:18.872 --> 15:26.616
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I guess the cool thing is, even though I haven't been able to play my Xbox for the past 21 days, 25 days, month, basically, I got the codes.

15:26.976 --> 15:30.718
[SPEAKER_10]: So, now I got to extend out my Xbox Live Gold for three months.

15:30.738 --> 15:39.883
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I guess that's cool, but I'm still waiting for the money because the email I got said, it may take up to 10 days for the money to actually get credited to your credit card or whatever.

15:39.903 --> 15:42.084
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just like, oh my God, it's been over a month.

15:42.544 --> 15:44.805
[SPEAKER_10]: That's 150 bucks I had to eat for a month.

15:45.086 --> 15:46.866
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, luckily I have a savings account, but it's just...

15:48.307 --> 16:09.014
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of irritating I mean really it takes that long to figure out that a different IP and different MAC address Xbox probably in another country logged in and did it you know it's just come on but whatever at least it's on the path to getting fixed and I was able to finally play the 360 this week a little bit I'll talk in a moment about some things I was playing on there

16:10.140 --> 16:12.160
[SPEAKER_10]: One other thing I want to bring up because I was thinking about this today.

16:13.381 --> 16:20.962
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at Fry's, which obviously is a big retailer out here on the West Coast, a big electronics store, and was looking at 3DS games randomly.

16:21.642 --> 16:23.883
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, Star Fox 64 just came out.

16:24.843 --> 16:33.645
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was looking at the Namco Generations that just came out as well, which is, you know, for us folks that like our retro games, it's like a Pac-Man reimagining, Pac-Man Championship Edition.

16:33.685 --> 16:34.825
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Galaga...

16:35.265 --> 16:37.027
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Pac-Man and Galaga Legions.

16:38.268 --> 16:39.128
[SPEAKER_09]: Dimensions, I'm sorry.

16:39.649 --> 16:41.891
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Dimensions, so it's all 3D and all that stuff.

16:41.911 --> 16:43.212
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was really tempted to get it.

16:43.492 --> 16:43.712
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't.

16:44.092 --> 16:44.893
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the thing.

16:44.933 --> 16:46.534
[SPEAKER_10]: I looked at the price tag and I was like, it's $40.

16:46.735 --> 16:46.534
$40?

16:46.795 --> 16:47.996
[SPEAKER_10]: 3DS games are $40.

16:48.076 --> 16:49.477
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that, but... I know, it's Pac-Man.

16:53.360 --> 16:59.866
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting to me because they just recently cut the cost of the 3DS from $250 to $160.

16:59.906 --> 17:03.149
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know if that's really the problem.

17:03.229 --> 17:04.330
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem are those games.

17:04.370 --> 17:05.451
[SPEAKER_10]: Those games are too expensive.

17:05.471 --> 17:06.712
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll talk to my Namco guy.

17:06.772 --> 17:10.195
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, dude, I got tons of 3DS games.

17:10.775 --> 17:12.337
[SPEAKER_09]: I just ended up giving them away to my friends.

17:12.357 --> 17:14.058
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, sweet, cool, send me some.

17:14.218 --> 17:14.739
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

17:15.379 --> 17:17.421
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not gonna say no to that, that's for sure.

17:17.481 --> 17:24.028
[SPEAKER_10]: But for the masses and everybody out there, and even other games, like Star Fox 64, I might have considered buying if it was $20.

17:24.128 --> 17:25.609
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know why?

17:25.710 --> 17:34.799
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because they claim that it's like, oh, well, it takes extra development time and stuff to develop the extra dimension or whatever it is.

17:35.359 --> 17:38.940
[SPEAKER_09]: or maybe the dev kids cost a little more.

17:38.980 --> 17:48.563
[SPEAKER_10]: The cost more for the other dimension is a load of turd because they came out and they said any game that uses a z-axis in calculation you can easily adapt it to 3D.

17:48.743 --> 17:50.263
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just another virtual camera.

17:50.724 --> 17:51.664
[SPEAKER_10]: It's ridiculous.

17:52.504 --> 17:55.805
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody who says that that extra dimension should cost more money is full of crap.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.806
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's just because it's a new generation they think they can up the prices.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.508
[SPEAKER_10]: and I think that's going to be the problem holding it back.

18:01.748 --> 18:16.499
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and it's interesting to me because there's been a lot of talk lately about how stubborn Nintendo has been and how much they have really not liked the mobile gaming stuff because 99 Cent Angry Birds has been cheapening quote unquote the game industry as a whole.

18:17.339 --> 18:24.186
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm kind of like, well, I don't think 99 Cent Angry Birds is the reason why I feel like a $40 Pac-Man Galaga game is a rip-off.

18:24.326 --> 18:26.549
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care how many dimensions the fucking game has.

18:27.009 --> 18:30.433
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just like, $40 is a lot.

18:30.733 --> 18:38.881
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo's dumb in the sense that they think that a game like Angry Birds, a very basic physics puzzler game, I mean...

18:39.582 --> 18:40.142
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19:09.150 --> 19:09.450
[SPEAKER_09]: Done.

19:09.470 --> 19:11.212
[SPEAKER_09]: 99 cents.

19:11.252 --> 19:13.253
[SPEAKER_09]: You put it right out there, everyone will buy that shit.

19:13.333 --> 19:18.617
[SPEAKER_10]: The price of all these games really has to make me stop and think about what I really want.

19:18.657 --> 19:22.920
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, even $60 for a 360 or PlayStation 3 game is asking a lot of money.

19:23.301 --> 19:26.363
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's only a certain kind of game that I'm willing to pay that for.

19:27.003 --> 19:29.886
[SPEAKER_10]: Gone are the days that you would just pick up a game on a whim.

19:30.686 --> 19:31.207
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

19:31.347 --> 19:33.649
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, remember when you just, yeah, pick up a game on a whim.

19:33.689 --> 19:34.429
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks interesting.

19:34.449 --> 19:34.930
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try it.

19:35.310 --> 19:37.071
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, those days really seem gone.

19:38.592 --> 19:43.676
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking at the holiday, there's so many games coming out, and I'm really having to choose, like, okay, I gotta drop 60 bucks on all these games.

19:43.757 --> 19:44.737
[SPEAKER_10]: What am I actually gonna buy?

19:45.118 --> 19:45.618
[SPEAKER_10]: Skyrim.

19:46.138 --> 19:47.239
[SPEAKER_09]: See, that's the thing, though, is...

19:48.300 --> 20:03.819
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, gone are the days of buying something on a web, not necessarily playing something on a web, especially some, you know, how easy it is to pirate things nowadays on certain systems, so...

20:04.199 --> 20:06.102
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but that's a whole nother Oprah.

20:06.122 --> 20:06.683
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

20:08.586 --> 20:10.328
[SPEAKER_10]: Not even going into the piracy angles.

20:10.368 --> 20:12.331
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just say that most people don't do that.

20:12.471 --> 20:12.812
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.494
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's a lot of stuff.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.297
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll look at games that are coming out.

20:16.317 --> 20:17.198
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, hey, you know what?

20:17.258 --> 20:18.100
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be kind of cool to get.

20:18.120 --> 20:18.861
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I ask myself...

20:19.281 --> 20:34.163
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really going to play this because I have a lot of games that I buy and end up not really playing or finishing or something and I figure I should just finish the ones I have first and then buy the ones I really want and end up just not missing the ones I end up skipping on.

20:34.741 --> 20:36.763
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, interesting comment in our chatroom.

20:37.103 --> 20:42.007
[SPEAKER_10]: PartMachine in our chat says, if people played PC games, this would not be a problem.

20:42.567 --> 20:50.794
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting that that comment is said because one of the places where I do buy things on a whim, just because they're cheap and they look interesting, is Steam.

20:53.055 --> 20:56.538
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I bought a game on there for like $1.50 the other day.

20:56.638 --> 20:56.878
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

20:56.898 --> 21:00.241
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it was $1.50 and it was a puzzler and it looked interesting and I like puzzle games.

21:00.715 --> 21:03.196
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it sucks, it's only $1.50, right?

21:03.597 --> 21:10.140
[SPEAKER_10]: So funny enough, that is the place where I tend to spend a little more frivolously.

21:11.020 --> 21:11.541
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't...

21:13.035 --> 21:13.856
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe he's right.

21:14.817 --> 21:16.838
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, just like, you know, like virtual console stuff.

21:16.878 --> 21:18.019
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember virtual console stuff?

21:18.419 --> 21:20.741
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like six bucks a pop for NES games.

21:20.801 --> 21:27.506
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, fuck, you can get those NES games in NES form on cartridges for a lot cheaper than that.

21:27.927 --> 21:30.469
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just, I don't see the point.

21:30.549 --> 21:31.970
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially when they're not doing anything.

21:32.230 --> 21:33.951
[SPEAKER_09]: They're dumping a ROM into an emulator.

21:34.832 --> 21:35.913
[SPEAKER_09]: Why should they give you money for that?

21:36.573 --> 21:38.115
[SPEAKER_09]: I can go download that for free.

21:38.275 --> 21:41.818
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this a rant about the Mario 25th anniversary collection disc?

21:42.018 --> 21:42.118
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

21:43.459 --> 21:45.000
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:07.674 --> 22:08.495
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

22:25.262 --> 22:29.866
[SPEAKER_09]: You only have yourself to blame for Nintendo having $40 games on the 3DS.

22:29.926 --> 22:33.909
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because you're an idiot and you will buy this $30 Mario game.

22:33.929 --> 22:34.850
[SPEAKER_09]: That's literally wrong.

22:34.950 --> 22:39.975
[SPEAKER_09]: They could have put it on the Virtual Console, sold it for $10, and would have been the same damn game.

22:40.275 --> 22:44.038
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, Nintendo being smart, they said, hey, you know what, we're going to charge $30 for it.

22:44.078 --> 22:45.179
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll call it Limited Edition.

22:45.199 --> 22:46.400
[SPEAKER_09]: We're actually going to make it Limited.

22:46.760 --> 22:50.784
[SPEAKER_09]: And now that shit goes on eBay for like $80 because people are dumb.

22:52.034 --> 22:56.255
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at the same token, today I said no to buying that game.

22:56.455 --> 23:00.015
[SPEAKER_10]: I looked at the game and I said, this looks really good, but I'm going to wait for it to end up in the clearance bin.

23:00.956 --> 23:03.636
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I know, I mean, I said the same thing about the Mario game.

23:03.656 --> 23:04.616
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, eh, screw it.

23:05.136 --> 23:09.337
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, a lot of other people didn't, and they're all sold out.

23:09.757 --> 23:16.698
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand, yeah, they may have been quite limited, but we're talking limited as in a few hundred thousand copies.

23:16.978 --> 23:20.879
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's a lot of money that they made from a ROM.

23:22.359 --> 23:27.681
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of PC games that Chat Comet has me thinking and Steam and Good Deals, I've got to plug this.

23:27.901 --> 23:30.342
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I have to as a fan of this game.

23:31.323 --> 23:37.345
[SPEAKER_10]: Civilization 5 is on sale right now and probably by the time the podcasties hear this, the sale will probably be done because I think it was just the weekend.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.486
[SPEAKER_10]: But at least for the live folks, it's like $12.50 right now for Civ 5.

23:41.206 --> 23:43.327
[SPEAKER_10]: My favorite Civilization since the original, for real.

23:43.567 --> 23:44.768
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

23:44.808 --> 23:45.128
[SPEAKER_10]: I played WoW.

24:13.877 --> 24:15.718
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, what a different week for you.

24:15.818 --> 24:16.899
[SPEAKER_07]: I got Rebecca Black to 80.

24:16.979 --> 24:20.801
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's funny you have a character named Rebecca Black.

24:20.821 --> 24:22.102
[SPEAKER_07]: I made it as a total joke.

24:22.522 --> 24:23.783
[SPEAKER_10]: It hasn't had to change your name yet.

24:24.203 --> 24:24.384
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

24:25.244 --> 24:26.685
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm not going to pay to change your name.

24:26.745 --> 24:28.686
[SPEAKER_07]: If they want me to change your name, they're going to give me a free name change.

24:29.046 --> 24:29.707
[SPEAKER_10]: They usually do.

24:29.967 --> 24:31.868
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm going to name her Becca Black.

24:34.130 --> 24:35.591
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe Lady Arc Music.

24:35.851 --> 24:36.291
[SPEAKER_07]: Friday.

24:36.951 --> 24:37.852
[SPEAKER_07]: Friday, that'd be funny.

24:38.993 --> 24:42.016
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to change Fatty Cakes to Ursulol, but I like Fatty Cakes.

24:43.797 --> 24:46.860
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I played some Tiny Tower and Sims.

24:47.300 --> 24:50.483
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Sims 3 and the stupid other Sims.

24:52.064 --> 24:56.088
[SPEAKER_07]: I just completely rearranged my house while you were here.

24:56.764 --> 24:57.644
[SPEAKER_10]: Sim's social, like...

25:21.989 --> 25:28.873
[SPEAKER_10]: Slash's Pop was telling me he tried to find a video that he posted to my wall and he couldn't find it amongst all the bullshit SimSocial posts.

25:29.274 --> 25:31.955
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can block the app, but that only goes so far.

25:32.075 --> 25:34.697
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, then when you go to the page, it doesn't show anything.

25:34.717 --> 25:38.119
[SPEAKER_10]: You keep having to load because that SimSocial posts so much stuff.

25:38.159 --> 25:39.000
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's just...

25:40.040 --> 25:47.206
[SPEAKER_10]: I want the game to come out on Google Plus because at least Google Plus kind of exiles that all to one, like the game stuff all has to be on a separate page.

25:47.806 --> 25:51.849
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really want SimSocial on Google Plus, but they probably won't bring it there for that reason.

25:52.209 --> 25:58.214
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably how they've got an assload of players is because it's all over Facebook and people are like, the Sims?

25:58.594 --> 25:59.575
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that game.

25:59.655 --> 26:02.697
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pissed off that my mother hasn't become my neighbor and I'm going to fuss at her.

26:03.337 --> 26:03.798
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

26:04.518 --> 26:24.938
[SPEAKER_07]: but um I'm apparently though in the game randomly dating like one of my old friends from the AOL days I am uh I'm actually a dating mistress Tia if you remember her from the show we're we're boyfriend and girlfriend in SimSocial and uh she came over for some woohoo the other day I can't woohoo my girlfriend in game because she doesn't have a double bed but we can play in the bathtub

26:26.875 --> 26:27.475
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow!

26:28.536 --> 26:30.656
[SPEAKER_07]: You can click on the bathtub and woohoo in the bathtub.

26:30.736 --> 26:34.137
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna be one of those weeks here on Orange Slouch Radio.

26:34.378 --> 26:35.778
[SPEAKER_07]: I found a mod, by the way, for Sims 3.

26:35.818 --> 26:37.379
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute, don't you have a spa in your house?

26:37.419 --> 26:38.659
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't woohoo in the spa?

26:38.819 --> 26:39.319
[SPEAKER_10]: At her house.

26:39.359 --> 26:40.660
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me, you can woohoo in the spa.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.220
[SPEAKER_07]: At her house.

26:41.600 --> 26:41.900
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

26:42.340 --> 26:42.600
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

26:43.060 --> 26:47.602
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did find there's a patch for Sims 3 where you can change woohoo to fuck.

26:50.219 --> 27:15.222
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're finally breaking the animations where they're doing items with custom animations so everyone look toward Sexy Sims 2 for new mods because I had a ton of them on Sims 2 because I'm a little prevert I also played some Osutatakayo Endon while I was at school because I was bored and I started reading a book but I don't like it so I'm not going to read it anymore

27:16.522 --> 27:17.625
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to write a review on it.

27:17.686 --> 27:20.554
[SPEAKER_07]: So look on Geek Life for the Too Long Didn't Read.

27:21.852 --> 27:22.232
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

27:22.973 --> 27:23.213
[SPEAKER_10]: Plug.

27:23.653 --> 27:25.594
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on to Techmaster Loki.

27:25.634 --> 27:27.255
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your gaming week?

27:27.375 --> 27:29.356
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't play a ton of different things.

27:29.696 --> 27:32.777
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly just Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon.

27:33.378 --> 27:39.581
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm starting to level up my Jet character now, so that's at level 5, I believe.

27:40.341 --> 27:45.724
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, my Tactical's at 8, and just playing a little bit more of that.

27:45.744 --> 27:49.646
[SPEAKER_09]: We were trying to play some of the Remix missions on Inferno, and it was just...

27:50.206 --> 27:53.128
[SPEAKER_09]: It's as hard as Inferno in the first game, which is really hard.

27:54.329 --> 27:55.890
[SPEAKER_09]: Then more Grand Theft Auto stuff.

27:56.110 --> 28:03.415
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been messing around with that and made some new mods that no one's done yet, so I'll have to work on that stuff later on.

28:06.598 --> 28:07.438
[SPEAKER_09]: What else did I play?

28:09.700 --> 28:10.801
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's pretty much it.

28:10.921 --> 28:15.544
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried that vid rhythm once, and it was just kind of like, eh.

28:16.825 --> 28:19.607
[SPEAKER_10]: Which didn't end up being a game, which although the app itself

28:20.316 --> 28:20.916
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

28:40.714 --> 28:42.235
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing really rhythm about it.

28:42.295 --> 28:44.977
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just vid record clip.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.218
[SPEAKER_09]: Vid clipping.

28:47.818 --> 28:48.619
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much, yeah.

28:49.900 --> 28:50.760
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else in your gaming week?

28:51.020 --> 28:52.321
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

28:52.781 --> 28:55.363
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, Irene, you said you've been very busy at school lately.

28:56.023 --> 28:59.185
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anything that you have been playing in the past week or so that you want to acknowledge?

29:00.706 --> 29:01.407
[SPEAKER_06]: Guild Wars.

29:02.427 --> 29:04.829
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you've been playing Guild Wars, like old school Guild Wars, huh?

29:04.849 --> 29:05.629
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that been going for you?

29:07.690 --> 29:10.332
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's been going well.

29:11.954 --> 29:13.276
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you do in Guild Wars?

29:13.316 --> 29:14.618
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you keep playing Guild Wars?

29:15.659 --> 29:24.290
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's free and I don't have a lot of time to play, so I won't feel like a stupid bitch if I pay $15 a month for a game that I never play.

29:25.410 --> 29:42.258
[SPEAKER_10]: so Guild Wars, Guild Wars I've always kind of called the game at least there's always Guild Wars you know when you have to quit WoW and Final Fantasy XI or whatever your MMO addiction is a choice at least there's always Guild Wars if you've bought it at some point whether it be back when it first came out or one of those ridiculous Steam sales

29:42.478 --> 29:43.338
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

29:58.144 --> 30:06.349
[SPEAKER_10]: and people are drawing conclusions from this that Final Fantasy XI is looking to ditch the PlayStation 2 because that's what's holding it back, tech-wise.

30:06.769 --> 30:13.494
[SPEAKER_10]: If Final Fantasy XI could ditch the PlayStation 2, they could do all new textures, the game could get an overhaul.

30:13.894 --> 30:20.278
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be very interesting because then Final Fantasy XI could hypothetically look like Final Fantasy XIV but not suck.

30:21.489 --> 30:24.072
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just get rid of Final Fantasy XIV.

30:24.132 --> 30:25.394
[SPEAKER_09]: Just pretend it doesn't exist.

30:25.974 --> 30:27.035
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell everybody, hey, you know what?

30:28.016 --> 30:29.578
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you bought Final Fantasy XIV.

30:31.380 --> 30:32.061
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to make it XI.

30:34.280 --> 30:35.181
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll call it 14.

30:35.221 --> 30:37.702
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just upgrade 11 to 14.

30:38.202 --> 30:47.507
[SPEAKER_10]: 11 other M. Let me go back to Guild Wars for a minute because I've got to say I am really excited looking at the Guild Wars 2 footage even though it doesn't really look like Guild Wars 1 at all.

30:48.228 --> 30:52.530
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know you can kind of start earning stuff for Guild Wars 2 in Guild Wars right now.

30:52.850 --> 30:53.991
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you excited about...

30:54.721 --> 30:55.682
[SPEAKER_10]: Guild Wars 2 at all?

31:13.564 --> 31:41.254
[SPEAKER_10]: they really try to go out of their way in their developer stuff to really say like it's it's this isn't like other MMOs and we're trying to not approach this like other MMOs we're not trying to emulate other MMOs but my only issue with that is that that's what everybody else has said too and it just ends up being wow but you know what they're able to back up their claims if you look at the gameplay footage if you like look at the screen art all that stuff you know that it's different from wow so it's not just another wow clone is that supposed to be a 2011 release or is that not till next year

31:41.929 --> 32:03.463
[SPEAKER_10]: uh no they haven't even done beta for it oh so it's not going to be out for a while gotcha yeah well good that's one less game i have to buy this year yeah because i i will yeah it looks looks pretty awesome from the stuff i've seen yeah i'm way more interested in that than even like old republic sorry star wars fans but i'm just i guild wars 2 looks awesome yeah i could talk for hours about it but i won't

32:04.215 --> 32:04.755
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but you should.

32:04.855 --> 32:05.776
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you start right now?

32:07.397 --> 32:08.898
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're just going to cut off my mic.

32:09.138 --> 32:09.378
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

32:10.478 --> 32:12.700
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

32:13.580 --> 32:13.820
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

32:14.140 --> 32:14.381
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

32:15.101 --> 32:15.781
[SPEAKER_10]: My gaming week.

32:16.762 --> 32:21.965
[SPEAKER_10]: I finally, after like weeks and weeks, and I know this is old news to a lot of you, but this is what I've been playing.

32:22.245 --> 32:22.765
[SPEAKER_10]: I played L.A.

32:22.825 --> 32:29.789
[SPEAKER_10]: Noire finally for the first time, which was what I was referring to earlier when I said I was playing a game that felt like playing a movie a little bit.

32:30.029 --> 32:30.850
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, L.A.

32:30.890 --> 32:31.270
[SPEAKER_10]: Noire.

32:31.970 --> 32:36.111
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, I gotta say though, I like it more than I thought I would.

32:36.151 --> 32:40.773
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not usually super into these Grand Theft Auto games, and certainly there's components of L.A.

32:40.833 --> 32:47.915
[SPEAKER_10]: Noire that kind of feels like, oh, it's Grand Theft Auto in the 40s, but that's really just like the driving around stuff, and a little bit of the combat stuff.

32:48.215 --> 32:54.577
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked the interrogation and the clue finding and all that stuff, even though I am so fucking terrible at interrogations.

32:54.797 --> 32:59.979
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe how much I bombed what is supposed to be the easiest fucking case in the game.

33:00.526 --> 33:01.307
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33:23.923 --> 33:29.546
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, even in the first case where it's so, like, their expressions are, like, over the top.

33:29.866 --> 33:31.226
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you can really read them.

33:31.767 --> 33:35.088
[SPEAKER_10]: I was, I got every single question wrong my first time.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.509
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, multiple times.

33:36.689 --> 33:38.070
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I was trying to figure out what's going on.

33:38.330 --> 33:41.171
[SPEAKER_10]: Thankfully, the game didn't be all like, you lose, game over.

33:41.231 --> 33:46.994
[SPEAKER_10]: It just kind of, I just got yelled at repeatedly by the boss and finally I got through it, figured out the right answers.

33:47.554 --> 33:51.916
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, I liked the expressions and the faces look really...

33:53.476 --> 33:53.696
[SPEAKER_10]: Neat.

33:53.956 --> 33:55.437
[SPEAKER_10]: And the voice acting's well done, too.

33:55.757 --> 33:57.517
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you're laughing over there, Irene.

33:57.977 --> 34:01.578
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, the, you know, faces looked neat.

34:01.638 --> 34:02.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you played it at all?

34:02.959 --> 34:05.900
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not played it, but I watched one of our friends play it.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.620
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's a stupid game.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.021
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think it's stupid?

34:09.041 --> 34:09.781
[SPEAKER_06]: It's corny.

34:09.921 --> 34:12.922
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, I mean, like, okay, so you chase after a guy.

34:13.282 --> 34:13.762
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

34:14.182 --> 34:14.622
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun.

34:14.802 --> 34:16.163
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you, like, interrogate.

34:16.243 --> 34:16.763
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just...

34:17.483 --> 34:27.452
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels unnatural when you're trying to interrogate them and then if you do it wrong that stupid ass sergeant guy just like is crazy and he yells at you like he's a psycho.

34:27.812 --> 34:28.112
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

34:28.573 --> 34:32.056
[SPEAKER_06]: And that just was the point when I tuned out because I didn't care.

34:33.157 --> 34:37.421
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost like being on a game show because like you find out right away if you fucked up or not.

34:37.481 --> 34:39.302
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you hit the button and right away it just fades up.

34:39.743 --> 34:40.263
[SPEAKER_10]: Incorrect.

34:40.323 --> 34:41.644
[SPEAKER_10]: And you hear a little doo doo doo.

34:42.065 --> 34:44.427
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like god damn it.

34:45.737 --> 34:46.097
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.898
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they'll yell at you like the chicks.

34:47.958 --> 34:48.938
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll get out of my store.

34:48.998 --> 34:49.659
[SPEAKER_10]: You're an asshole.

34:49.679 --> 34:52.100
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, but you totally look like you were lying, bitch.

34:53.680 --> 34:55.721
[SPEAKER_10]: Set your store on fire now.

34:55.841 --> 35:00.763
[SPEAKER_10]: See, that's where the game needed more Grand Theft Auto because like, bitch, I'm going to set the store on fire then.

35:01.143 --> 35:06.065
[SPEAKER_10]: But I couldn't do that because you're supposed to be a cop and cops don't set things on fire randomly, you know?

35:06.265 --> 35:06.565
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

35:06.825 --> 35:08.526
[SPEAKER_06]: Eleanor is not Grand Theft Auto.

35:09.972 --> 35:17.697
[SPEAKER_07]: I listened to Dan play the whole thing because I was in here and I was like, wow, this is historically accurate given the dialogue.

35:18.337 --> 35:19.638
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I saw the ending.

35:19.958 --> 35:22.179
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to spoil, but I was like, what?

35:23.820 --> 35:24.381
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the ending.

35:25.481 --> 35:27.042
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they had to leave it for DLC, I guess.

35:27.062 --> 35:27.743
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know the ending.

35:27.783 --> 35:28.703
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not going to tell you.

35:28.743 --> 35:30.745
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to say, it's what?

35:31.725 --> 35:32.145
[SPEAKER_07]: When you see it.

35:32.346 --> 35:32.606
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

35:32.866 --> 35:33.006
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

35:33.513 --> 35:33.973
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll see.

35:34.053 --> 35:34.374
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

35:34.474 --> 35:41.037
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the attention span of a three-year-old, so I don't know if I'll get that far, but I'll probably at least play it a few more times before I return it back to Loki.

35:42.178 --> 35:43.499
[SPEAKER_10]: I've only had it for like two months.

35:43.519 --> 35:45.160
[SPEAKER_10]: What's another month going to hurt?

35:45.180 --> 35:49.262
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny you say that because a three-year-old was watching me play WoW last night, and she would not stop asking me questions.

35:49.742 --> 35:50.003
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

35:50.063 --> 35:51.203
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of questions does a three-year-old ask?

35:51.223 --> 35:52.884
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in Icecrown, too, which was really boring.

35:53.024 --> 35:55.286
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of questions does a three-year-old ask about World of Warcraft?

35:55.306 --> 35:56.266
[SPEAKER_07]: Are those bad guys?

35:56.386 --> 35:57.207
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they're bad guys.

35:57.527 --> 35:58.527
[SPEAKER_07]: I like bad guys.

35:58.567 --> 35:59.228
[SPEAKER_07]: They're strong.

36:00.845 --> 36:04.470
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, but I have to beat up the bad guys so I'm stronger than they are.

36:05.051 --> 36:08.856
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, you're pretty cool too, but that bad guy's a big bug.

36:08.896 --> 36:09.957
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they eat other bugs?

36:09.977 --> 36:11.479
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're playing Horde, right?

36:11.619 --> 36:11.799
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

36:12.060 --> 36:12.240
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

36:12.460 --> 36:13.141
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing Alliance.

36:13.522 --> 36:14.303
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, then never mind.

36:16.892 --> 36:20.134
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, you have to remember, Horde isn't the bad guys.

36:20.415 --> 36:22.416
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just an alternative lifestyle.

36:22.456 --> 36:25.098
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't know what you'd call it.

36:25.158 --> 36:26.399
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the other faction.

36:27.620 --> 36:30.542
[SPEAKER_10]: Either you're a goat person or you're a cow person.

36:30.602 --> 36:31.442
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just whatever.

36:31.802 --> 36:33.404
[SPEAKER_07]: Space goat, coast to coast.

36:34.224 --> 36:34.664
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

36:35.345 --> 36:36.826
[SPEAKER_10]: Other games I've played this week besides L.A.

36:36.866 --> 36:37.146
[SPEAKER_10]: Noire.

36:37.227 --> 36:47.495
[SPEAKER_10]: I revisited the Wii a little bit this week because if you were listening to the show a couple weeks ago, I hacked my Wii and I have a drive now that I'm loading all my games to, which they're my games.

36:47.855 --> 36:51.758
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been dumping them to the drive just because I can.

36:51.878 --> 36:52.239
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

36:52.279 --> 36:53.099
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought it would be fun.

36:53.580 --> 36:55.321
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I never have to get up from the couch and...

36:57.022 --> 37:02.366
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's actually forced me to revisit a lot of old Wii games I haven't played in years.

37:02.406 --> 37:03.607
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm actually kind of glad I did it.

37:03.647 --> 37:06.509
[SPEAKER_10]: And these are all games I've talked about on the show years and years ago when I first bought them.

37:06.849 --> 37:08.790
[SPEAKER_10]: But I played Geometry Wars for a little while today.

37:08.810 --> 37:12.613
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know Geometry Wars had the Wii version, but it's really weird because you have to actually point.

37:12.953 --> 37:14.634
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have two analogs on the Wii, right?

37:14.874 --> 37:19.337
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have one analog and then you actually point on the screen for your other analog.

37:19.818 --> 37:22.700
[SPEAKER_10]: And the nice thing about it, I don't know, it's a different way to control it.

37:22.860 --> 37:23.380
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of cool.

37:23.420 --> 37:26.202
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually just point at the ships and it's, I don't know.

37:26.882 --> 37:31.546
[SPEAKER_10]: But I like that the game had all sorts of different maps, all sorts of different types of modes.

37:31.607 --> 37:32.427
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fun game.

37:33.308 --> 37:36.491
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I was randomly playing New Super Mario Bros.

37:36.531 --> 37:36.971
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii today.

37:37.432 --> 37:37.752
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

37:38.453 --> 37:39.073
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I could.

37:39.493 --> 37:39.834
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was...

37:41.431 --> 37:44.013
[SPEAKER_10]: They really just tried to remake Mario 3 with that game, I think.

37:45.594 --> 37:47.215
[SPEAKER_10]: As minimal effort as possible.

37:47.235 --> 37:48.616
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not a bad game, though.

37:49.256 --> 37:49.996
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not a bad game.

37:50.016 --> 37:52.158
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually one of the better games on the Wii.

37:52.178 --> 37:53.078
[SPEAKER_09]: But see, that's the point.

37:53.399 --> 37:56.961
[SPEAKER_09]: The point is you don't have to spend a lot of development money to make a game.

37:57.041 --> 38:04.286
[SPEAKER_09]: You could put out something that's very similar to another game, just change up the levels, and then you don't charge as much.

38:06.207 --> 38:06.487
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

38:09.384 --> 38:15.349
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so, let's see, what else did I play this week besides revisiting the Wii?

38:15.529 --> 38:15.889
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, 360!

38:16.329 --> 38:20.052
[SPEAKER_10]: Since that's up and running again, I played Insane Twisted Shadow Planet.

38:20.072 --> 38:24.736
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I was really into that game, and then the Xbox got hacked, and I was pissed off, so I played a little more of that.

38:25.236 --> 38:31.401
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's getting to the point where it's getting a lot harder, but I basically have determined that this is like Metroid, but kind of like more of a puzzler.

38:31.821 --> 38:32.622
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is kind of awesome.

38:32.942 --> 38:34.803
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, Insane Twisted Shadow Planet.

38:34.903 --> 38:36.144
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you would actually really like it.

38:36.164 --> 38:36.545
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

38:37.265 --> 38:38.926
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, did you try it, Irene?

38:39.086 --> 38:39.546
[SPEAKER_06]: I've tried it.

38:39.686 --> 38:40.206
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

38:40.387 --> 38:42.848
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one where the robot flies around and he has to use his different app.

38:42.868 --> 38:44.148
[SPEAKER_06]: The spaceship.

38:44.268 --> 38:44.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

38:44.649 --> 38:45.469
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes, that's it.

38:46.049 --> 38:46.970
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's all right.

38:47.050 --> 38:47.270
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?

38:47.550 --> 38:47.750
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

38:47.790 --> 38:48.070
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.

38:48.170 --> 38:49.271
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really fun.

38:49.611 --> 38:49.791
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

38:50.531 --> 38:57.735
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'm in the ice world right now, which supposedly the game's only supposed to take like seven or eight hours to beat, but some of it's like really hard.

38:58.715 --> 39:04.138
[SPEAKER_10]: The difficulty really amped up really fast from the ocean level to the snow level, I noticed, is kind of interesting.

39:04.158 --> 39:04.238
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

39:04.565 --> 39:05.346
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'll see you next time.

39:21.818 --> 39:22.058
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

39:43.803 --> 39:44.344
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:05.642 --> 40:23.956
[SPEAKER_10]: uh we will be here back again next week with a show but we will not be here in oh i'm sorry i will not be here in two weeks but i believe they're gonna have a show without me so tune in to hear more on that because i'm going to san francisco and i'm not going to be here in two weeks so i think they're trying to find a guest host or something

40:24.281 --> 40:24.881
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go with you.

40:24.901 --> 40:26.981
[SPEAKER_10]: I already bought the tickets.

40:27.021 --> 40:27.422
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

40:28.282 --> 40:29.082
[SPEAKER_10]: You're expensive.

40:30.302 --> 40:30.742
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

40:31.982 --> 40:33.863
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to thank you on air, by the way.

40:34.063 --> 40:34.243
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

40:34.563 --> 40:36.763
[SPEAKER_07]: For my present for kitty sitting.

40:37.263 --> 40:40.184
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, at the Disneyland show we were gone last time.

40:40.224 --> 40:41.444
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Duffy now.

40:41.704 --> 40:43.804
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Duffy purse, but he's cute and he lives on my wall.

40:44.205 --> 40:44.665
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

40:45.305 --> 40:45.845
[SPEAKER_10]: Glad you like it.

40:45.905 --> 40:50.246
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for house-sitting the cats who chewed up the $50 headphones I own while we were gone.

40:50.306 --> 40:51.606
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, someone left them on the floor.

40:51.886 --> 40:52.206
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't.

40:53.069 --> 40:58.131
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you don't think, oh, I gotta make sure that the cord isn't dangling a little bit from my desk.

40:58.331 --> 41:01.692
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, if I had known, I would have taken care of it.

41:01.712 --> 41:02.412
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't expect you to know.

41:03.192 --> 41:05.853
[SPEAKER_09]: Please tell me that you've watched that trailer that I just linked you to.

41:06.253 --> 41:06.933
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I haven't.

41:07.633 --> 41:08.374
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this all about?

41:08.394 --> 41:10.474
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the brand new trailer for Saints Row the Third.

41:10.554 --> 41:13.695
[SPEAKER_09]: It's highlighting their third gang called the Deckers.

41:14.155 --> 41:16.716
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh boy, alright, let's check this out before we get into the news.

41:17.616 --> 41:18.437
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna like this.

41:18.657 --> 41:19.637
[SPEAKER_09]: You may have to buy it.

41:20.257 --> 41:20.937
[SPEAKER_09]: Saints Row the Third.

41:20.977 --> 41:22.438
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm already thinking I have to buy it.

41:22.478 --> 41:23.338
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you should.

41:24.899 --> 41:25.839
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I'm looking at trailer.

41:25.899 --> 41:26.399
[SPEAKER_10]: Rate it down.

41:26.439 --> 41:26.859
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

41:28.240 --> 41:31.721
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this makes for great ratings.

41:31.841 --> 41:32.681
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

41:32.821 --> 41:39.163
[SPEAKER_00]: That punk kid is the cyber god who just crashed your helicopter.

41:42.096 --> 41:48.842
[SPEAKER_10]: they are dressed up in Tron like gear like their jackets are all glowing blue keep watching alright

42:08.683 --> 42:09.723
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, keep watching.

42:09.763 --> 42:11.324
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, they're all racing on cars.

42:12.244 --> 42:12.464
Oh no.

42:12.484 --> 42:12.744
Oh yes.

42:12.784 --> 42:15.425
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh please tell me they're gonna get on light pipes and shit.

42:15.465 --> 42:20.287
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, they're not even like trying to hide the fact what inspires this, are they?

42:44.417 --> 42:48.841
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait to play this fucking game.

42:49.001 --> 42:52.604
[SPEAKER_06]: How is this at all like the other two games?

42:53.965 --> 42:56.087
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just confused.

42:56.167 --> 43:00.732
[SPEAKER_10]: Because with Saints Row, they've decided to just say, you know what?

43:01.012 --> 43:01.472
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck it.

43:01.492 --> 43:03.734
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not even going to just try to be a real game anymore.

43:03.794 --> 43:05.576
[SPEAKER_10]: This is all about excess.

43:06.036 --> 43:07.337
[SPEAKER_10]: This game is just excessive.

43:08.218 --> 43:10.159
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unnecessary and excessive.

43:10.439 --> 43:14.882
[SPEAKER_09]: Each trailer, they go more over the top than the last one.

43:15.302 --> 43:20.686
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how you're going to get more over the top than going into a virtual world and fighting stuff Tron style.

43:22.087 --> 43:22.947
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

43:24.188 --> 43:25.509
[SPEAKER_07]: I want now.

43:27.130 --> 43:55.619
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw in our chatroom also points out the fact that they're called the Deckards is a reference to Blade Runner so it's not just Tron that's inspiring this although visually it's certainly very very Tron-esque so yeah Harrison Ford was Deckard so anyhow here's the thing I'm almost sold on Saints Row 3 but it's also one of those you know what I don't want to buy into trailers just I'm gonna wait for the game to come out see the reviews see Loki's review very important I know he thinks he's gonna love it but

43:56.079 --> 44:19.051
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta hear, look, dude, dude, what, I was listening to Bobby's show before we were live tonight, right, as I usually do on The Car Ride Over, and Madden came out this past week, which is usually, like, a huge release, apparently Madden has, I mean, I don't really play the Madden games, but I know they're huge, and everybody buys them, and they're very important, very, very high profile games, probably only second to, like, a Call of Duty game

44:20.672 --> 44:35.345
[SPEAKER_10]: and apparently the menus fucking freeze and shit like just basic shit is broken in Madden it sounds like from what I'm hearing it's like there's literally nothing that this game could do to make me not want to buy it I mean there's nothing

44:36.332 --> 44:41.135
[SPEAKER_09]: absolutely nothing and come out and say the next gang is My Little Ponies and I wouldn't fucking care.

44:41.575 --> 44:44.697
[SPEAKER_09]: Although that would probably make me want to buy the game even more because it's so ridiculous.

44:44.917 --> 44:47.098
[SPEAKER_06]: What if you have to play Raiden for the rest of the game?

44:47.419 --> 44:50.060
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like play it still?

44:51.241 --> 44:51.541
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

44:51.961 --> 44:52.722
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

44:54.222 --> 44:54.823
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even understand.

44:54.843 --> 44:55.063
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

44:55.803 --> 44:57.604
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that his name from Metal Gear Solid 2?

44:58.725 --> 44:59.486
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

44:59.566 --> 44:59.846
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

44:59.886 --> 45:00.746
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that his name?

45:00.906 --> 45:01.187
[SPEAKER_10]: Raiden?

45:02.167 --> 45:02.487
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

45:02.767 --> 45:03.008
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

45:03.948 --> 45:04.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

45:04.669 --> 45:05.409
[SPEAKER_06]: Womp, womp, womp.

45:08.297 --> 45:34.118
[SPEAKER_10]: Blackwolf is in chat actually and points out deckers are also the term in Shadowrun for the grid hackers so lots of references that is very true I've played one yes I did play Shadowrun alright well thank you for derailing the show with that trailer it's actually very interesting looking alright let's actually get into the news we were planning on discussing tonight 45 minutes into the show and we'll start off with almost an immediate follow up to something last week that came up at the end of the show right Loki?

45:34.727 --> 45:35.389
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon Quest X

45:43.147 --> 45:45.689
[SPEAKER_09]: Or at least they're going to make an announcement about Dragon Quest.

45:46.370 --> 45:48.792
[SPEAKER_09]: That announcement was Dragon Quest X Online.

45:49.252 --> 45:50.593
[SPEAKER_09]: It is an online RPG.

45:51.354 --> 45:57.199
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is going to be... I'm not sure if it's still being... It looks like it's still being developed by Level 5.

45:58.160 --> 46:01.063
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, they're responsible for Dragon Quest VIII and IX.

46:02.744 --> 46:04.326
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is coming out on the Wii.

46:04.646 --> 46:07.208
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I guess it's being developed for the Wii U as well.

46:08.169 --> 46:08.329
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

46:11.195 --> 46:17.459
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they're saying also they're considering the 3DS as some form of character transfers or something like that.

46:20.001 --> 46:27.906
[SPEAKER_09]: It does of course require an internet connection being that it's an online MMO and it's going to require a fee as well.

46:28.686 --> 46:30.988
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's going to be some sort of usage fee for that.

46:32.849 --> 46:35.631
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of interesting because there's really no MMOs on the Wii and

46:37.813 --> 46:41.616
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering the Wii's pretty much at the end of its life cycle already, that's kind of weird.

46:42.357 --> 46:49.723
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I gotta admit, we were talking about this briefly on the show last week because the press conference was about to start when we ended the show last week.

46:50.144 --> 47:01.113
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I drive home, I get home, I go into the house, and I fire up my reader to look at what news I missed while the show was going on, and there's an announcement about Dragon Quest X, and I'm like, oh, Dragon Quest X is gonna be online?

47:01.673 --> 47:02.214
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Wii?

47:02.534 --> 47:03.195
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

47:03.775 --> 47:08.159
[SPEAKER_10]: Online, Wii, syntax error, I don't understand, how does this compute?

47:08.860 --> 47:10.141
[SPEAKER_10]: You just divided by zero.

47:11.022 --> 47:17.888
[SPEAKER_09]: The Monster Hunter game over there was, I believe, had paid online as well.

47:19.950 --> 47:25.613
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking, though, that this is mainly just going to be a Wii U game, but that they're like, well, you know what, we're going to make it.

47:26.033 --> 47:27.534
[SPEAKER_10]: Since we promised it on the Wii.

47:28.034 --> 47:32.936
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's make a version also for the Wii because, you know, we still have a user base for that.

47:32.956 --> 47:34.257
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a Zelda-esque type of thing.

47:34.277 --> 47:41.780
[SPEAKER_10]: Because remember, Zelda Twilight Princess was a launch title, but they had to make the GameCube version because they had originally announced it for GameCube, and it was kind of the same hardware.

47:41.801 --> 47:42.721
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, really, more like...

47:42.961 --> 47:48.377
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it was ready for the GameCube, but they delayed it so they could put it as a Wii launch title.

47:48.417 --> 47:50.623
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly what they're doing here with Dragon Quest X.

47:52.156 --> 47:52.596
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Momomish

48:16.431 --> 48:18.513
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's Momo-ish, but it's not... Yeah, I guess.

48:18.893 --> 48:21.915
[SPEAKER_09]: So they would probably have an offline component as well.

48:22.035 --> 48:31.962
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's going to be online only, but when I hear usage fees and requires the internet, that screams MMO to me.

48:32.959 --> 48:42.067
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Guru in our chatroom says, from the makers of Final Fantasy XIV, from the publishers of Final Fantasy XIV, it is a different studio putting this together, right?

48:42.087 --> 48:46.912
[SPEAKER_10]: Level 5 had nothing to do with Final Fantasy XIV or any Final Fantasy game for that matter that I can think of.

48:47.412 --> 48:49.254
[SPEAKER_10]: So, no, these are different teams.

48:49.294 --> 48:50.014
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important to say.

48:50.415 --> 48:54.999
[SPEAKER_10]: I get your joke, but hopefully the MMO experience doesn't completely suck.

48:55.599 --> 49:06.221
[SPEAKER_10]: or whatever online adventuring experience they come up with, which I'm convinced is going to be more like White Knight Chronicles, which was kind of... That game's really kind of a cult kind of game.

49:06.281 --> 49:10.682
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't really break through, but there's definitely a player base playing that game.

49:11.082 --> 49:16.163
[SPEAKER_09]: But once again, this also begs one simple question.

49:16.903 --> 49:19.464
[SPEAKER_09]: This game is definitely niche.

49:19.904 --> 49:20.164
[SPEAKER_09]: It is...

49:21.464 --> 49:22.305
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very niche.

49:22.325 --> 49:24.546
[SPEAKER_09]: You're talking about an online game.

49:24.706 --> 49:26.527
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, an online MMO on the Wii.

49:27.228 --> 49:28.589
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot of people are going to bite on that.

49:28.909 --> 49:30.770
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's an RPG.

49:31.230 --> 49:34.352
[SPEAKER_09]: A Japanese-style RPG on the Wii.

49:34.392 --> 49:38.755
[SPEAKER_09]: That's talk about narrowing the user base down quite a bit.

49:39.735 --> 49:45.859
[SPEAKER_09]: And yet, no Last Story or Xenoblade or anything like that over here.

49:46.840 --> 49:48.160
[SPEAKER_09]: But yet, they're going to bring that out.

49:48.180 --> 49:48.561
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

49:49.401 --> 49:53.626
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR Dollar Bill in the chatroom says, explain how you guys define MMORPG.

49:54.066 --> 50:00.433
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, I mean, obviously it's a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, right?

50:00.473 --> 50:03.977
[SPEAKER_10]: But the reason why Phantasy Star Universe kind of doesn't fall out of that category...

50:05.338 --> 50:06.880
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

50:23.453 --> 50:26.634
[SPEAKER_10]: Where you can interact with people and then you have the game.

50:26.674 --> 50:29.215
[SPEAKER_10]: You form your parties in the lobby and then you really go play the game.

50:29.515 --> 50:30.855
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have chat.

50:31.195 --> 50:31.875
[SPEAKER_07]: You have voice chat.

50:32.356 --> 50:33.556
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was a big component.

50:33.656 --> 50:34.596
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's nothing else.

50:34.696 --> 50:38.878
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no game component really in those lobbies outside of shops.

50:39.278 --> 50:40.138
[SPEAKER_07]: And playing hockey.

50:40.298 --> 50:41.758
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no PvP.

50:42.258 --> 50:43.499
[SPEAKER_10]: And playing hockey.

50:43.559 --> 50:44.499
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

50:45.219 --> 50:47.200
[SPEAKER_07]: And the giant choo-choo rocket level.

50:47.600 --> 50:48.280
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

50:48.360 --> 50:54.583
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think that it better be an MMO because what am I paying for online then for?

50:55.024 --> 50:57.065
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the Wii, it's online and it's free.

50:57.205 --> 51:01.207
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would I have to pay to play a game I just bought online?

51:01.227 --> 51:02.747
[SPEAKER_10]: Because MMOs you pay to play.

51:02.908 --> 51:08.430
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, MMOs you pay to play, but if it's not an MMO, if we're just talking about a game with some four-player, 16-player online...

51:10.251 --> 51:11.953
[SPEAKER_10]: White Knight Chronicles White Knight Chronicles

51:29.548 --> 51:30.228
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

51:49.699 --> 51:50.260
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

52:10.462 --> 52:15.445
[SPEAKER_09]: and then you totally ignored your hardcore gamer user base in the process.

52:15.905 --> 52:19.126
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's going to work out really well for you for this next console as well.

52:21.721 --> 52:24.563
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just... I don't think it's going to do very well.

52:24.863 --> 52:28.465
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just look at all the other niche hardcore games that have been out there.

52:29.446 --> 52:32.368
[SPEAKER_09]: RPGs and non-RPGs.

52:32.768 --> 52:33.809
[SPEAKER_09]: They just haven't done well.

52:34.029 --> 52:38.052
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand this is going to be published probably by... I don't know if it's Square Enix.

52:38.092 --> 52:44.015
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm guessing Nintendo because they did the last Dragon Quest game and Dragon Quest Monsters 2 and stuff like that.

52:45.717 --> 52:49.359
[SPEAKER_09]: So if it's published by Nintendo, I mean, there'll be some more marketing behind that, but...

52:51.224 --> 52:52.784
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna be tough.

52:52.884 --> 52:54.985
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially convincing people.

52:56.125 --> 52:58.185
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, I don't know.

52:58.425 --> 52:58.865
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be tough.

52:59.005 --> 53:02.146
[SPEAKER_10]: I just need to really see more of the game before I can really make a call.

53:02.406 --> 53:07.267
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta play the game, see some reviews, see some trailers that aren't just cutscenes.

53:07.807 --> 53:08.287
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not.

53:08.427 --> 53:10.808
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I just... Like, I love Dragon Quest VIII.

53:10.888 --> 53:13.188
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, that game was so fucking good on the PlayStation.

53:13.268 --> 53:15.709
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I just... We'll see.

53:16.949 --> 53:17.889
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if it's worth paying...

53:18.109 --> 53:22.651
[SPEAKER_10]: but it sounds like there's going to be still at least a full single player game and that part I kind of like at least.

53:22.671 --> 53:24.252
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Phantasy Star Universe is the same way.

53:24.272 --> 53:41.900
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if it's got that then that's fine and it's worth a purchase because then you don't have to play the online portion of it and if they're going to go the whole Phantasy Star online route then that's fine but it's just if they're going just an MMO route that's going to be a difficult sell.

53:42.860 --> 53:44.262
[SPEAKER_09]: 3DS Circle Pad Attachment

54:03.241 --> 54:10.848
[SPEAKER_10]: The 3DS will plug into this kind of, it looks like a docking bay sort of thing that has, yes, another analog stick on the right-hand side.

54:11.588 --> 54:22.197
[SPEAKER_10]: Along with this announcement came an announcement that they are making Monster Hunter Tri-G on the 3DS, which, you know, requires a second analog controller just the way the game is.

54:22.638 --> 54:28.403
[SPEAKER_10]: So now what's kind of confusing is, did they do this circle attachment just to get the Monster Hunter game,

54:28.903 --> 54:30.003
[SPEAKER_10]: or is this the future of the 3DS

54:58.972 --> 55:21.370
[SPEAKER_09]: If I have to... I mean, I don't know if I would play a Monster Hunter game, but if this ends up being the norm, which I worry it could be... They're obviously... I mean, if Nintendo's making a peripheral for this game, and I know Monster Hunter's gonna be big in Japan, if it even comes out over here, if they're making a peripheral for this, you better damn well believe that's gonna be used for something other than just one game.

55:21.970 --> 55:24.913
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, why even bother if it's gonna be for just one game?

55:25.593 --> 55:27.214
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, as you said...

55:28.135 --> 55:31.116
[SPEAKER_09]: The cost thing, you didn't give me free games because you dropped the price of the system.

55:31.156 --> 55:31.556
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

55:31.596 --> 55:32.377
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't have to do that.

55:32.417 --> 55:35.058
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I understand the price is going to drop.

55:35.098 --> 55:36.838
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was a little bit sooner than I had thought.

55:36.918 --> 55:37.619
[SPEAKER_09]: But whatever.

55:37.639 --> 55:37.999
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

55:38.019 --> 55:39.639
[SPEAKER_09]: That's too well.

55:40.340 --> 55:40.620
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

55:40.880 --> 55:42.600
[SPEAKER_09]: So I bought the system back in March.

55:42.640 --> 55:44.661
[SPEAKER_09]: I had it a few months with no games.

55:45.221 --> 55:49.863
[SPEAKER_09]: And I dropped it, and they gave me some free virtual console games, which I've not played.

55:50.583 --> 55:51.764
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's fine.

55:51.924 --> 55:55.025
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is going to split your user base in half now.

55:55.405 --> 56:14.859
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is great, because now everyone thinks that the system is going to be redesigned, whether it is or not, and all the people that are thinking about, hey, I really need to pick up a 3DS this holiday to pick up some Mario and Mario Kart games and stuff like that, and whatever else they have coming for the 3DS, people are going to wait.

56:15.519 --> 56:20.120
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be interesting to see what Nintendo says to this press conference because I'm looking at our chatroom, of course, is lighting up on this story.

56:20.180 --> 56:22.241
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to join us live.

56:23.041 --> 56:27.642
[SPEAKER_10]: Zether in chat says, as of now, that add-on is only for Monster Hunter Tri-G.

56:28.162 --> 56:35.204
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm kind of going, okay, yeah, as of now, but there's certainly that skeptic in me that's saying, but now that that's out there, who else might use it?

56:35.524 --> 56:39.625
[SPEAKER_10]: Now granted, just because the peripheral exists doesn't mean everybody's going to use it.

56:39.705 --> 56:44.407
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I think of, okay, that Metroid pinball game had that rumble pack in the DS.

56:44.467 --> 56:45.287
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that thing?

56:45.307 --> 56:46.767
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a real flash in the pan, right?

56:47.288 --> 56:49.188
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think any other games really used it.

56:49.328 --> 56:50.829
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's a bunch of games that used it.

56:50.849 --> 56:51.209
[SPEAKER_09]: Were there?

56:51.409 --> 56:51.529
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

56:52.029 --> 56:53.671
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh, I always thought there were like one or two.

56:53.731 --> 56:59.158
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot, but see that thing right there though, that's not necessary to play the game.

56:59.438 --> 57:01.941
[SPEAKER_09]: Rumble, eh, whatever, so my system doesn't rumble.

57:01.961 --> 57:03.102
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a big deal.

57:03.603 --> 57:04.964
[SPEAKER_09]: None of them do nowadays anyways.

57:06.126 --> 57:07.868
[SPEAKER_09]: But a second analog stick is kind of important.

57:07.908 --> 57:09.149
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like saying, oh, you know,

57:10.350 --> 57:25.275
[SPEAKER_09]: we added some buttons in fact that does add a couple shoulder buttons to the thing as well and a trigger I think so that's a big deal because now you have dual analogs so you can do first person shooters on that system quite well now

57:25.815 --> 57:26.936
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57:53.252 --> 58:02.100
[SPEAKER_10]: and could it be all this call about, gee, what do you mean the system's only going to come with one Wii U controller and we're not going to buy a second controller separately?

58:02.520 --> 58:04.562
[SPEAKER_10]: Could this be the path we're going down?

58:04.662 --> 58:04.922
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

58:06.523 --> 58:07.624
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly what they're doing.

58:07.644 --> 58:21.056
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know when that controller first came out, listen to the episodes of OLR leading up to the reveal of the Wii U because it's very interesting because we were theorizing and theorizing and then all of a sudden it just kind of dawned on us that like,

58:21.716 --> 58:28.287
[SPEAKER_10]: Duh, everything we have heard about this was clearly just the Wii U controller is a freaking DS without the top screen.

58:28.648 --> 58:29.870
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the Wii U controller is.

58:30.050 --> 58:30.971
[SPEAKER_10]: And a few more buttons.

58:31.512 --> 58:33.035
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's your few more buttons now.

58:33.916 --> 58:35.599
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very interesting.

58:37.082 --> 58:41.804
[SPEAKER_10]: This Nintendo conference that's coming up tomorrow is going to be very interesting.

58:43.684 --> 58:46.645
[SPEAKER_10]: I just can't wait to hear their rationalization.

58:47.886 --> 58:58.410
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see if they only announce the Monster Hunter thing for this or if they say a new Pokemon game and the Pokemon game is going to use two analog sticks too because then it's over.

58:58.470 --> 58:59.350
[SPEAKER_10]: All the games are using it.

59:00.414 --> 59:01.476
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just one game.

59:20.695 --> 59:25.200
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, you should have fucking thought of this when you're designing your system.

59:25.461 --> 59:26.061
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I don't know.

59:26.141 --> 59:26.602
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

59:27.002 --> 59:28.204
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the PSP.

59:28.544 --> 59:30.626
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the number one bitch about the PSP?

59:30.806 --> 59:32.869
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have a fucking second analog stick.

59:33.349 --> 59:33.830
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd you think?

59:33.870 --> 59:34.450
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you know what?

59:34.771 --> 59:37.193
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe people want a second analog stick.

59:37.774 --> 59:43.098
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh, could that be possibly what people want since they're saying I want a second analog stick?

59:43.518 --> 59:45.099
[SPEAKER_09]: Nah, that's not what they want.

59:45.139 --> 59:46.620
[SPEAKER_09]: They just want one analog stick.

59:46.640 --> 59:47.380
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're going to do.

59:47.400 --> 59:49.642
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to leave them with just one analog stick.

59:50.443 --> 59:51.123
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, damn.

59:51.403 --> 59:54.305
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a big game comes out that needs a second analog stick.

59:55.026 --> 59:55.666
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, crap.

59:55.686 --> 59:58.148
[SPEAKER_09]: We better make another adjustment to this.

59:58.628 --> 01:00:02.591
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'd be pissed even if it is an accessory or whatever.

01:00:03.031 --> 01:00:07.014
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only does it make it, you know, how the fuck am I supposed to carry that around with me now?

01:00:08.275 --> 01:00:09.556
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to fucking fit in my pocket.

01:00:11.277 --> 01:00:21.727
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, again, we have to really wait until after Nintendo makes the official announcement because I think it's still, I mean, even though we have the picture and everything, it's still too early to say what the point of this is.

01:00:21.887 --> 01:00:25.330
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this a Monster Hunter add-on or is this, we don't know.

01:00:26.131 --> 01:00:30.495
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're all looking at it going, gosh, it makes your 3DS look like a Wii U controller.

01:00:31.476 --> 01:00:33.858
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, a lot of people want to have that second analog stick.

01:00:34.758 --> 01:00:37.400
[SPEAKER_10]: We've heard rumors about a 3DS redesign anyway.

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:39.381
[SPEAKER_10]: It would all add up.

01:00:39.421 --> 01:00:40.562
[SPEAKER_10]: This is probably happening.

01:00:40.662 --> 01:00:48.847
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of akin this to – and I see some folks in chat are talking about, well, not every peripheral goes on forever, like the e-reader, printer, and so forth.

01:00:48.867 --> 01:00:51.448
[SPEAKER_10]: But I go – and none of these are ever required.

01:00:51.468 --> 01:00:54.410
[SPEAKER_10]: But then I go, but what about the Wii Plus motion thing?

01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:55.810
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii Motion Plus.

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:59.911
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii Motion Plus didn't come out until later and now it's like if you want to play the new Zelda game you have to have it.

01:01:00.371 --> 01:01:04.032
[SPEAKER_10]: It would not be unheard of for Nintendo to require this in the future.

01:01:04.052 --> 01:01:07.673
[SPEAKER_09]: This is more along the lines of Wii Motion Plus than it is the e-reader.

01:01:08.313 --> 01:01:11.854
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are all gimmicky things that weren't necessary like the Rumble Pack.

01:01:12.054 --> 01:01:14.735
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not necessary to play a DS game.

01:01:14.835 --> 01:01:15.735
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just a gimmicky thing.

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:17.916
[SPEAKER_10]: The e-reader was actually a really kind of cool idea.

01:01:17.956 --> 01:01:20.956
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a cool idea but it was still a gimmick.

01:01:20.996 --> 01:01:22.677
[SPEAKER_09]: You could have done something else to...

01:01:23.837 --> 01:01:27.718
[SPEAKER_10]: How awesome was it to have an old school NES game on five cards in your pocket?

01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:29.239
[SPEAKER_10]: That was kind of cool, I'm sorry.

01:01:30.039 --> 01:01:35.080
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's pretty cool, but at the same time, though, this is another analog stick.

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:37.461
[SPEAKER_09]: This is adding another joystick.

01:01:37.481 --> 01:01:40.201
[SPEAKER_09]: This is very significant.

01:01:41.662 --> 01:01:43.182
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a few extra buttons on there.

01:01:43.602 --> 01:01:46.403
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, is kind of interesting now that I think of it.

01:01:46.983 --> 01:01:50.804
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably going to use that IR port that's on the back of that fucking 3DS.

01:01:50.984 --> 01:01:52.905
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's like, what the hell is this IR port for?

01:01:54.239 --> 01:01:54.620
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:59.224
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just... Alright.

01:02:00.105 --> 01:02:02.107
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got more stories to talk about.

01:02:02.127 --> 01:02:05.250
[SPEAKER_09]: The 3DS and... Let me bring some of these up real quick.

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:08.833
[SPEAKER_10]: 3DS, obviously the price cut happened and a lot of you are very happy about it.

01:02:08.893 --> 01:02:10.074
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of you are happy about it?

01:02:10.795 --> 01:02:13.818
[SPEAKER_10]: Over 260% are buying this now than were before 3DS.

01:02:15.479 --> 01:02:21.760
[SPEAKER_10]: 3DS sold 185,000 units between the price cut and the month's end.

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:25.841
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a 260% increase over that same time period in July.

01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:32.442
[SPEAKER_10]: So it does mean that this has motivated sales a little more, and this is a trend that's going to continue through Christmas, guaranteed.

01:02:33.003 --> 01:02:38.904
[SPEAKER_10]: I still think, especially now that the Vita's not around this Christmas, this thing's going to sell like crazy over the holidays.

01:02:40.244 --> 01:02:47.089
[SPEAKER_10]: Despite all this other crap we're talking about, soccer moms don't know about... Soccer moms are not reading Famitsu magazine in Japan.

01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:52.853
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly think that the whole thing with the 3DS was really very carefully planned.

01:02:53.434 --> 01:02:59.298
[SPEAKER_07]: They knew they didn't have a good thing out quite yet, but at least at the higher price anyway with the intention of dropping the price.

01:02:59.638 --> 01:03:00.779
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they knew it would...

01:03:02.304 --> 01:03:04.126
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sales would happen after a price drop.

01:03:04.326 --> 01:03:05.527
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

01:03:05.687 --> 01:03:12.072
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of actually disagree because I think Nintendo saw the reception at E3 and was like, holy shit, we've struck gold with this thing.

01:03:12.092 --> 01:03:13.213
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to get it out now.

01:03:13.534 --> 01:03:15.735
[SPEAKER_10]: And they put it out in some ways too soon.

01:03:16.136 --> 01:03:20.840
[SPEAKER_10]: But where I will hear is that I think the strategy all along was a build-up to Christmas.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:26.304
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they released it at the end of the fiscal year to pad the low sales of Wii and then it's going to just...

01:03:27.225 --> 01:03:30.747
[SPEAKER_10]: The price drop, on the other hand, I don't think that was planned.

01:03:30.927 --> 01:03:34.928
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because if they were planning on doing it, well, no one plans on dropping the price of that.

01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:37.149
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they've got to be selling it at a loss now.

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:46.193
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they weren't selling it at a loss and they had that much of a margin in there, they could have fit a second fucking analog stick in there.

01:03:46.213 --> 01:03:49.154
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, an analog stick doesn't cost hardly anything.

01:03:49.194 --> 01:03:52.076
[SPEAKER_09]: It's maybe $10 to put in that system.

01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:53.922
[SPEAKER_09]: I doubt it's even $10.

01:03:54.823 --> 01:03:56.706
[SPEAKER_09]: I've bought replacements for my PSP.

01:03:56.746 --> 01:03:59.329
[SPEAKER_07]: The 3DS production cost is $101 per unit.

01:03:59.590 --> 01:03:59.670
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:00.251
[SPEAKER_07]: So, including overhead...

01:04:07.305 --> 01:04:08.586
[SPEAKER_07]: They're probably still pulling a profit on it.

01:04:08.726 --> 01:04:13.608
[SPEAKER_09]: So they could have charged 10 extra dollars in what they're charging now and added a second analog stick all along.

01:04:13.908 --> 01:04:14.528
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:16.169
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, guess what, Nintendo?

01:04:16.369 --> 01:04:20.291
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good thing to have things on your system, like say a second analog stick.

01:04:20.711 --> 01:04:21.452
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know what?

01:04:21.492 --> 01:04:26.674
[SPEAKER_09]: You may not have a use for it right now, but publishers would probably want that.

01:04:27.554 --> 01:04:29.515
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes development of games a little bit easier.

01:04:29.675 --> 01:04:33.097
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of having to do some funky right analog stick using the touchscreen.

01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:34.012
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:04:57.711 --> 01:04:58.432
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's not dead.

01:04:59.112 --> 01:04:59.913
[SPEAKER_10]: It's far from it.

01:05:00.033 --> 01:05:05.696
[SPEAKER_10]: They've just announced that on September 18th there will be a metallic rose DSiX.

01:05:05.756 --> 01:05:06.517
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fucking pink.

01:05:06.797 --> 01:05:10.520
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fucking pink DSi and it's coming out on September 18th.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.560
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want it.

01:05:12.301 --> 01:05:16.704
[SPEAKER_07]: In the same way that I wanted my pink Advance that I have the Afterburner in.

01:05:17.484 --> 01:05:18.345
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want this now.

01:05:18.405 --> 01:05:19.486
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know, whatever.

01:05:19.606 --> 01:05:21.427
[SPEAKER_10]: The DSiX, you know, the screens are really big.

01:05:21.467 --> 01:05:22.448
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of nice, whatever.

01:05:22.488 --> 01:05:25.350
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is weird that it's the same price as the 3DS.

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:27.131
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a little weird to me.

01:05:28.212 --> 01:05:29.953
[SPEAKER_10]: DS Lights, by the way, are still on shelves.

01:05:29.973 --> 01:05:31.114
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a really pretty blue one.

01:05:32.575 --> 01:05:33.796
[SPEAKER_10]: 99 bucks for DS Light.

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:36.899
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting to me.

01:05:39.501 --> 01:05:39.702
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:40.422
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

01:05:40.883 --> 01:05:41.984
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get empty.

01:05:42.404 --> 01:05:42.704
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

01:05:42.904 --> 01:05:46.548
[SPEAKER_09]: These people that buy these, you know, this pink system that's coming out, same price as the 3DS...

01:05:48.482 --> 01:05:50.505
[SPEAKER_09]: You deserve all those high-priced games and shit.

01:05:50.585 --> 01:05:58.436
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, we're gonna revisit all of this again next week because the Nintendo press conference is happening in a couple days and who knows what curveballs are gonna come out of that.

01:05:58.817 --> 01:06:02.101
[SPEAKER_10]: There could be that... I mean, if a Pokemon game is announced...

01:06:03.018 --> 01:06:04.939
[SPEAKER_10]: They already have a Pokemon game.

01:06:05.099 --> 01:06:06.340
[SPEAKER_10]: What Pokemon game?

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:07.161
[SPEAKER_10]: Not 3D.

01:06:08.702 --> 01:06:09.002
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

01:06:09.162 --> 01:06:13.605
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they have a Pokemon, but it's like Pokemon Snap.

01:06:13.945 --> 01:06:16.026
[SPEAKER_10]: Pokemon Snap is not really a Pokemon game.

01:06:16.086 --> 01:06:17.407
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

01:06:17.467 --> 01:06:19.348
[SPEAKER_10]: They need a Pokemon Magenta.

01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:23.451
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no Pokemon game that's going to need a second analog stick.

01:06:26.252 --> 01:06:27.633
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you just haven't thought of it yet.

01:06:27.653 --> 01:06:28.914
[SPEAKER_09]: A Pokemon first-person shooter.

01:06:29.074 --> 01:06:30.775
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be all sorts of lame.

01:06:31.416 --> 01:06:32.297
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that would be awesome.

01:06:32.437 --> 01:06:32.857
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you kidding?

01:06:32.877 --> 01:06:33.998
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it would be stupid.

01:06:35.956 --> 01:06:37.817
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon First Person Shooter.

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:40.179
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that pretty much Pokemon Snap?

01:06:40.539 --> 01:06:41.139
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.

01:06:41.159 --> 01:06:44.542
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're shooting from a first person perspective.

01:06:44.902 --> 01:06:45.482
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, get out.

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:46.103
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

01:06:46.203 --> 01:06:47.283
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I agree.

01:06:47.463 --> 01:06:48.564
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a first person shooter.

01:06:48.944 --> 01:06:54.668
[SPEAKER_07]: You just shot photos of them and not, you know, shooting them dead with bullets into their, you know, cute little fuzzy heads.

01:06:55.388 --> 01:06:58.991
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying Goldeneye would have been that much better if it was Pikachu killing people.

01:06:59.131 --> 01:06:59.571
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

01:07:02.293 --> 01:07:04.394
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let's move on.

01:07:04.835 --> 01:07:05.435
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

01:07:05.899 --> 01:07:06.740
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Crytek?

01:07:07.441 --> 01:07:08.041
[SPEAKER_07]: Fail!

01:07:10.223 --> 01:07:17.411
[SPEAKER_07]: One of their, I guess, former employees decided that they were going to go off on Tumblr.

01:07:17.771 --> 01:07:23.296
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an anonymous account, which I took the liberty of reblogging everything on our Tumblr.

01:07:23.697 --> 01:07:24.257
[SPEAKER_07]: Hint, hint, hint.

01:07:24.358 --> 01:07:26.159
[SPEAKER_07]: OrangeLoungeRadio.tumblr.com

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:36.130
[SPEAKER_07]: and basically is listing this whole just crazy line of stuff that they've done that's illegal.

01:07:37.411 --> 01:07:40.434
[SPEAKER_07]: Going over this, he said, I'm going to read a little bit.

01:07:40.855 --> 01:07:49.163
[SPEAKER_07]: From the outside, Crytek produces some of the most graphically pleasing games around, those being Far Cry, Crysis, Crysis, Warhead, and Crysis 2, 4 games in 10 years.

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:55.208
[SPEAKER_07]: The work of the individual responsible, the individual should be proud of what they've done.

01:07:55.908 --> 01:08:08.417
[SPEAKER_07]: But they basically said that there's a bullying mentality given at the CEO levels where they're delivered lines like, you should be proud to work for Crytek yet demanding six months of crunch time due to project management failures.

01:08:09.077 --> 01:08:12.820
[SPEAKER_07]: This caused certain members of staff to suffer both in medical and personal ways.

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:31.433
[SPEAKER_07]: and he's listing, alright, the splitted the work atmosphere that resulted in the resignation and or unlawful firing of global talent manager, global head of resourceful humans, lead game designer, lead community manager, community manager, lead researcher, storyboard and concept artist and a whole list of developers and designers.

01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:50.200
[SPEAKER_07]: and so basically the article you know he's just there on Tumblr pretty much blasting them I mean nothing really specifically listed just said that a lot of senior staff was made redundant and that employees were quote allowed to work longer hours and weekend days

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.061
[SPEAKER_07]: which, again, Crytek's a German developer in violation of German law.

01:08:56.062 --> 01:09:11.227
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the co-founder, Avni Yerli, said, and he spoke with Develop about these practices and said that they were misleading accusations and, quote, is very distressing for us to think that an individual thinks we've been treating them unfairly.

01:09:11.287 --> 01:09:12.288
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very disappointing.

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:15.429
[SPEAKER_07]: So I actually found a rebuttal on the same Tumblr.

01:09:17.632 --> 01:09:44.253
[SPEAKER_07]: and he goes on saying as previously mentioned we do not aim to mislead or give erroneous opinions as this would ultimately decrease the strength on which the blog was first created and it is nothing but bring into doubt the levels of truth featured within so he said if German labor codes were being met and strictly adhered to there would be no need for the successful court cases against Crytek GmbH in which a company lawyer was present

01:09:45.094 --> 01:09:50.838
[SPEAKER_07]: Crytek, if you can provide proof that no one has ever successfully claimed compensation due to an illegal firing, then please do so.

01:09:51.218 --> 01:09:51.658
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot.

01:09:53.179 --> 01:09:54.500
[SPEAKER_07]: And so basically just going on.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.501
[SPEAKER_07]: You can read this all if you want to.

01:09:56.541 --> 01:09:57.662
[SPEAKER_07]: I've linked them both on our Tumblr.

01:09:58.382 --> 01:10:01.744
[SPEAKER_07]: But it really goes long.

01:10:01.824 --> 01:10:04.906
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's talking just... This is clearly somebody who was there.

01:10:06.727 --> 01:10:11.490
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of those cases where I think you go, okay, you read this and you go, well...

01:10:12.059 --> 01:10:14.440
[SPEAKER_10]: Another person complaining about the development industry.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.221
[SPEAKER_10]: What a shock.

01:10:15.401 --> 01:10:16.461
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably true.

01:10:17.022 --> 01:10:22.124
[SPEAKER_10]: But then you look at it and you go, well, he probably does have a lot of bitterness issues.

01:10:22.224 --> 01:10:23.525
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously something happened there.

01:10:23.645 --> 01:10:25.006
[SPEAKER_07]: None of this reads like anyone bitter.

01:10:25.206 --> 01:10:28.448
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I still think the answer's probably in the middle somewhere.

01:10:28.988 --> 01:10:33.350
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably, you know, and I think I just said this two weeks ago on the show on a very similar story.

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:38.893
[SPEAKER_10]: There's your side of the story, my side of the story, and the truth somewhere in the middle.

01:10:39.173 --> 01:10:40.534
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably what's happening here too.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.723
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's another line on here, though, that I think is a very good point.

01:10:44.923 --> 01:10:47.885
[SPEAKER_07]: Enforcing weekend work and expecting them to come in are two different things.

01:10:48.445 --> 01:10:54.930
[SPEAKER_07]: As an employee, you know that if you aren't showing the drive and ambition to become a team player, your direct line manager may take a negative stance on your progression in the company.

01:10:55.510 --> 01:11:05.878
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, it's talking about the impact it has on home life, on employee well-being, which is actually something that I think is a big problem here in the U.S., to be perfectly honest.

01:11:06.699 --> 01:11:06.919
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

01:11:09.022 --> 01:11:11.083
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't read any bitterness into any of this.

01:11:11.103 --> 01:11:24.768
[SPEAKER_07]: This is someone who loved his job or her job and was proud of the work that they did and found that the entire, just from reading the whole thing, found that the work environment is what soured it.

01:11:25.668 --> 01:11:29.710
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very proud of their work, very proud of what they did, but it was all environmental.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:35.982
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be interesting to see if this anonymous person is forced to reveal themselves later on or what happens.

01:11:36.222 --> 01:11:37.483
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to end it with the last line.

01:11:38.303 --> 01:11:44.046
[SPEAKER_07]: We make and made great games and we just want to see the atmosphere and blatant disregard for employee morale improve.

01:11:45.846 --> 01:11:46.167
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

01:11:47.467 --> 01:11:48.067
[SPEAKER_07]: More power to you.

01:11:48.247 --> 01:11:48.588
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

01:11:48.908 --> 01:11:49.408
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

01:11:50.054 --> 01:11:50.354
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:11:52.115 --> 01:11:57.418
[SPEAKER_09]: So we talked a little bit about Ubisoft and their different DRM that they're going to have for upcoming games.

01:11:57.998 --> 01:12:06.603
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the first ones that was going to take place on console was this new Uplay Passport thing that they were doing with Driver San Francisco.

01:12:08.114 --> 01:12:10.836
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem was it didn't quite go as planned.

01:12:11.696 --> 01:12:21.883
[SPEAKER_09]: Driver San Francisco on Xbox 360 was supposed to include a Uplay passport code required to access multiplayer beyond a 48-hour trial period.

01:12:22.924 --> 01:12:28.828
[SPEAKER_09]: However, they forgot to put the codes in many of the copies that went out.

01:12:31.329 --> 01:12:31.950
[SPEAKER_09]: Brilliant work.

01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:42.474
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so what ended up happening, and this is only really in North America, what ended up happening, though, is the people that bought it, you can actually get the passport for free.

01:12:42.895 --> 01:12:45.596
[SPEAKER_09]: You just either sign in, and there's two options.

01:12:45.636 --> 01:12:56.760
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one to start my two-day free trial, which will not expire now, or select Uplay Passport Purchase, which will be provided at no charge.

01:12:57.121 --> 01:12:57.281
[SPEAKER_09]: So,

01:12:58.081 --> 01:13:05.136
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wanted to right now, you could purchase that game for used or whatever and still get online for free.

01:13:06.018 --> 01:13:07.381
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they fucked up.

01:13:07.621 --> 01:13:09.204
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically the whole thing just went out the window.

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:11.459
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, on the Xbox 360 at least.

01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:20.121
[SPEAKER_09]: Still going on the PlayStation 3 because they didn't forget in that one, but Xbox 360 at least they forgot.

01:13:20.141 --> 01:13:22.382
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's nice and fair.

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:24.683
[SPEAKER_09]: And surprisingly, the game got pretty good reviews.

01:13:25.083 --> 01:13:28.084
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't think it would be that well, but it did all right.

01:13:29.005 --> 01:13:36.913
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, FromDust on PC had that wonderful online, you have to be always online in order to play the game.

01:13:37.273 --> 01:13:39.796
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now they have a patch that removes that DRM.

01:13:40.477 --> 01:13:43.620
[SPEAKER_09]: So the title can be played in offline mode as well now.

01:13:46.395 --> 01:13:49.077
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess a follow-up to that had come up a couple weeks ago.

01:13:49.137 --> 01:13:54.300
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that some people were pissed that an extra layer of DRM was added to the Steam version.

01:13:55.041 --> 01:13:55.601
[SPEAKER_10]: Not cool.

01:13:57.703 --> 01:14:04.827
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, moving on to a story about Xbox and some bans going on on Xbox Live.

01:14:05.228 --> 01:14:15.975
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, Xbox has actually put out a statement this week that they did ban quite a few users this week and it was a result of theft was the keyword they used.

01:14:16.956 --> 01:14:22.981
[SPEAKER_10]: The company, quote, discovered users who were illegitimately accessed Xbox Live Marketplace downloadable content.

01:14:23.341 --> 01:14:29.426
[SPEAKER_10]: This access was intentional and not accidental, constituting a blatant violation of the terms of use for the service.

01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:33.509
[SPEAKER_10]: But they won't give any more specifics about what's going on.

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:39.954
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's known around the internet that there are some ways that you can steal the stuff and Microsoft has finally clamped down on it.

01:14:39.974 --> 01:14:43.037
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not entirely stealing, but yeah, there is a way.

01:14:43.993 --> 01:14:45.714
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you mean it's not entirely stealing?

01:14:45.774 --> 01:14:47.836
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if somebody did that when my account was hacked.

01:15:03.567 --> 01:15:04.867
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll see you next time.

01:15:27.734 --> 01:15:28.835
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I think that's how it works.

01:15:28.875 --> 01:15:29.315
[SPEAKER_09]: Never tried it.

01:15:29.395 --> 01:15:33.336
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say that there's got to be some type of hack that goes there.

01:15:33.376 --> 01:15:50.682
[SPEAKER_10]: For instance, when my 1360 red-ringed and I had to get another, I put on the hard drive with all my old games on it, and if I wasn't connected to the internet, my game would show up as a demo at first, but then it would turn into the real game after I was signed in.

01:15:51.642 --> 01:15:56.708
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think something happens there where it's just the demo version, but when Xbox Live talks to it.

01:15:57.028 --> 01:15:58.770
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not sure how they're pulling that off.

01:15:58.790 --> 01:16:01.253
[SPEAKER_10]: There's got to be something a little shady there.

01:16:01.994 --> 01:16:08.882
[SPEAKER_10]: I was hoping at first that this meant they caught the people that were stealing all the people's money, but I guess it doesn't sound like that.

01:16:08.942 --> 01:16:10.824
[SPEAKER_10]: And Microsoft still has not said anything about that.

01:16:10.844 --> 01:16:11.504
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they, in fact...

01:16:12.065 --> 01:16:12.726
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

01:16:27.903 --> 01:16:30.486
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so this is one of those cases where you don't want to share.

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:38.772
[SPEAKER_10]: Majinomicon in our chat says, I wonder if that also applies to the Free Fable 2 glitch that happened a few months ago.

01:16:39.433 --> 01:16:40.674
[SPEAKER_10]: I seem to remember that.

01:16:40.734 --> 01:16:41.855
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

01:16:42.195 --> 01:16:50.803
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because that was a legitimate mistake on Microsoft's part that a lot of people went in and just took advantage of, but at the end of the day, that was Microsoft's fault for leaving that switch open.

01:16:50.843 --> 01:16:54.506
[SPEAKER_10]: People weren't hacking their consoles or going around to get it.

01:16:55.046 --> 01:16:56.407
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:17:18.024 --> 01:17:20.525
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the next story actually has to do with Pinball FX.

01:17:21.306 --> 01:17:25.248
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the developer says that Microsoft is pretty okay in their book.

01:17:25.848 --> 01:17:32.131
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, it's kind of putting down on Team Meat for what they said, putting down Microsoft.

01:17:33.432 --> 01:17:38.714
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a quote on here from Mel Kirk, who is Zen Studio's Vice President of Marketing.

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:41.636
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, they totally have the right to talk about it.

01:17:41.716 --> 01:17:45.657
[SPEAKER_07]: It's terrible they had a bad experience like that, but where we're coming from, when is enough enough?

01:17:45.718 --> 01:17:46.438
[SPEAKER_07]: Let it go already.

01:17:46.898 --> 01:17:51.645
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, they're just like, why are you trying to put them down?

01:17:51.685 --> 01:17:59.194
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not trying to discredit that you've had a bad time from this, but that it's time to get over it, time to move on.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:02.519
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're apparently sniping back and forth like children.

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:05.500
[SPEAKER_10]: It was interesting to read.

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:10.341
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if the tweets are still up, but they're archived around on the internet somewhere, I'm sure.

01:18:10.881 --> 01:18:14.182
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really one of those cases where I read it and I went, really?

01:18:14.242 --> 01:18:19.183
[SPEAKER_10]: People don't think more about the fact that everybody is watching these two companies fight?

01:18:19.383 --> 01:18:22.964
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't very flattering for either one, I think.

01:18:23.344 --> 01:18:27.425
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like anybody who fights on Twitter or on Facebook or whatever.

01:18:27.785 --> 01:18:32.286
[SPEAKER_10]: Emotions are running high, so you don't think before you click post, and then later you sort of regret it.

01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:41.689
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was nice to see that it all ended with a, you know, how about a super meat boy skin for pinball or whatever they had said at the end that they kissed and made up and cuddled.

01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:49.471
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, well, it even says on here that, you know, they're like good for them.

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:50.371
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a good time.

01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:52.212
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's great for them.

01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.849
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:55.890
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what the meat boy people said.

01:18:56.670 --> 01:19:02.332
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, it's working on the end, but it did seem kind of- Well, you should have seen the tweets, because the tweets were the equivalent of, fuck you, you fucking fuck.

01:19:02.552 --> 01:19:04.393
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, that's really how they read to me.

01:19:04.753 --> 01:19:04.913
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

01:19:05.734 --> 01:19:06.634
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, children.

01:19:07.014 --> 01:19:07.214
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:19:07.554 --> 01:19:11.556
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but it's like someone smacked them on the hand and said, now make nice.

01:19:12.096 --> 01:19:15.139
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, just the internet went... You guys look dumb right now.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.721
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're two great games, too.

01:19:18.221 --> 01:19:21.444
[SPEAKER_10]: I love both those games, Pinball FX 2 and Meat Boy, so it's kind of sad.

01:19:21.504 --> 01:19:24.467
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like watching your friends fight and you're just sitting there helpless.

01:19:24.487 --> 01:19:25.508
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't do anything about it.

01:19:25.908 --> 01:19:26.589
[SPEAKER_10]: I know how that feels.

01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:28.390
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

01:19:29.671 --> 01:19:30.372
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on.

01:19:30.412 --> 01:19:33.495
[SPEAKER_10]: Travel the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out

01:19:34.386 --> 01:19:35.647
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, let's start in the U.S.

01:19:53.544 --> 01:19:57.486
[SPEAKER_09]: White Knight Chronicles 2 is coming out this week as well.

01:19:57.526 --> 01:20:00.907
[SPEAKER_09]: That also includes the first game that's on PlayStation 3.

01:20:15.874 --> 01:20:32.610
[SPEAKER_09]: Camping Mama Outdoors Adventure on Nintendo DS Yes, she is still making games about different things other than cooking New Cooking Mama though coming out later this year Thor God of Thunder on the 3DS It was basically the same version as the ones back in May but now for the 3DS

01:20:33.471 --> 01:20:57.748
[SPEAKER_09]: DECA Sports Extreme coming out for the 3DS, Bit.Trip Saga, which is the collection of all the Bit.Trip games that's on the 3DS this week as well Puzzler Mind Gym on 3DS, Bit.Trip Complete, which is on the Wii, and that also includes the soundtrack for the game as well Call of Juarez the Cartel on PC, Red Orchestra 2, Heroes of Stalingrad on PC

[SPEAKER_09]: Nicktoons MLB, that's on the Xbox 360, Wii, and DS The God of War Origins Collection on PS3 coming out this week Puka Power Up, that's on Nintendo DS Aren't Pukas the little guys in Dig Dug?

01:21:18.234 --> 01:21:22.795
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no Oh, Puka P-U-C-C, I was thinking P-O-O-K-A

01:21:23.547 --> 01:21:24.488
[SPEAKER_07]: Silly English language!

01:21:24.528 --> 01:21:24.728
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:40.155
[SPEAKER_09]: Emily the Strange, Strangerous on the Nintendo DS.

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:42.617
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some dual packs coming out for the PSP.

01:21:42.637 --> 01:21:43.818
[SPEAKER_09]: I was unaware of here.

01:21:44.018 --> 01:21:45.199
[SPEAKER_09]: Mega Man Dual Pack.

01:21:45.339 --> 01:21:52.303
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that's Mega Man Pirate Legends and Mega Man... There was a Mega Man X game as well.

01:21:53.544 --> 01:21:54.345
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on PSP.

01:21:54.725 --> 01:21:56.466
[SPEAKER_09]: Then Monster Hunter Freedom Dual Pack.

01:21:56.566 --> 01:21:59.568
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the two Monster Hunter Freedom games that were out on the PSP over here.

01:22:02.210 --> 01:22:03.431
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is it.

01:22:05.971 --> 01:22:08.512
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there.

01:22:08.952 --> 01:22:13.773
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Xbox 360 on September 15th, Dunamis 15 is coming out.

01:22:13.813 --> 01:22:19.555
[SPEAKER_10]: That is not a series I recognize over here, but it is an adventure game that's coming out on the 15th.

01:22:21.255 --> 01:22:27.476
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's actually the 15th game in a series, but you do get bikini-clad anime girls as part of it.

01:22:27.596 --> 01:22:29.257
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, she's like wearing a little bra.

01:22:29.997 --> 01:22:30.657
[SPEAKER_10]: They're kind of cute.

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:32.419
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what type of game this is.

01:22:32.479 --> 01:22:33.820
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably another type of sim game.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.261
[SPEAKER_10]: But it looks like it has these mystery elements.

01:22:36.401 --> 01:22:36.762
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

01:22:37.082 --> 01:22:40.084
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to stop trying to guess what these games are because I'm probably getting it horrifically wrong.

01:22:40.384 --> 01:22:41.385
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is kind of fun to guess.

01:22:42.525 --> 01:22:44.627
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, though, probably not a game we're going to get over here.

01:22:45.507 --> 01:22:47.409
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's really it on the 360 this week.

01:22:47.449 --> 01:22:51.772
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to the PlayStation 3, they're getting that same game, and that's really it on the PlayStation 3.

01:22:52.552 --> 01:22:54.774
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some more stuff coming next week, just so you guys know.

01:22:56.475 --> 01:22:59.637
[SPEAKER_10]: And then going to the handhelds real quick.

01:23:02.318 --> 01:23:05.259
[SPEAKER_10]: Trying to pull up the PSP releases here.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.381
[SPEAKER_10]: God Eater Burst gets a price reduction.

01:23:08.721 --> 01:23:15.024
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, as far as new games go, there's Gekka Rioran Romance comes out from Idea Factory this week.

01:23:15.764 --> 01:23:16.645
[SPEAKER_10]: And this game...

01:23:18.847 --> 01:23:20.788
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it could be based off an anime.

01:23:21.429 --> 01:23:22.129
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.

01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:25.372
[SPEAKER_10]: I just know one of these screenshots says, Dessert.

01:23:25.552 --> 01:23:27.274
[SPEAKER_10]: Prohibited fruits scenario.

01:23:27.734 --> 01:23:30.737
[SPEAKER_10]: So apparently, there's no no fruits in this game.

01:23:32.618 --> 01:23:32.838
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura!

01:23:52.788 --> 01:23:57.230
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in other news, this is, of course, coming out in the UK.

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:02.532
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 13th, we have Hard Reset and Red Orchestra, Heroes of Stalingrad.

01:24:03.333 --> 01:24:09.195
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the 14th, we have From Dust, Radiant Silver Gun for Xbox Live Arcade, Renegade Ops, Trackmania 2.

01:24:09.916 --> 01:24:11.476
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the 15th, Moto Heroes.

01:24:13.617 --> 01:24:14.078
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty.

01:24:14.318 --> 01:24:18.119
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we got the classic game of the week.

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.180
[SPEAKER_10]: But first, Loki.

01:24:19.679 --> 01:24:19.859
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.345
[SPEAKER_09]: Infinity Ward is going to get their day in court next year in May on the 7th.

01:24:27.506 --> 01:24:33.851
[SPEAKER_09]: This is, of course, the whole trial where they were suing Activision for royalties unpaid.

01:24:33.892 --> 01:24:43.540
[SPEAKER_09]: They're seeking $125 million in unpaid royalties from the sales of Modern Warfare 2 and also wish to reclaim their contractual rights to the Modern Warfare brand.

01:24:44.781 --> 01:24:45.662
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

01:25:01.644 --> 01:25:03.645
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be me while this thing's in the courtroom.

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:10.388
[SPEAKER_10]: Because even though this isn't a series I'm a big, huge fan of, I'm excited to see somebody do battle with Activision.

01:25:10.428 --> 01:25:11.269
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be interesting.

01:25:12.409 --> 01:25:12.909
[SPEAKER_10]: Any bets?

01:25:14.170 --> 01:25:15.571
[SPEAKER_09]: We should place bets on the courtroom.

01:25:15.591 --> 01:25:18.092
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they're going to get... They probably will get their royalties.

01:25:18.212 --> 01:25:20.533
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they're going to get the Modern Warfare 2 stuff.

01:25:20.613 --> 01:25:22.974
[SPEAKER_09]: And even if they did, they'd just rename the damn franchise.

01:25:23.534 --> 01:25:24.695
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll still be the same thing, though.

01:25:25.135 --> 01:25:27.116
[SPEAKER_10]: Call of Heroes.

01:25:27.136 --> 01:25:28.257
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it'll still be Call of Duty.

01:25:28.317 --> 01:25:30.778
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll just be... You know...

01:25:31.565 --> 01:25:34.748
[SPEAKER_10]: Modernized Warnis or something.

01:25:36.369 --> 01:25:37.430
[SPEAKER_10]: Warfare Modern.

01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:39.051
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

01:25:40.232 --> 01:25:43.574
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Sony created a new job this week.

01:25:43.694 --> 01:25:53.402
[SPEAKER_10]: They hired a chief information security officer, which probably makes sense considering, oh, you know, they had that huge information breach earlier this year when their system got hacked.

01:25:53.762 --> 01:25:56.724
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're not fucking around with who they've hired for the position.

01:25:57.145 --> 01:25:58.826
[SPEAKER_10]: They have hired a former U.S.

01:25:58.926 --> 01:26:00.287
[SPEAKER_10]: Homeland Security official.

01:26:00.347 --> 01:26:00.868
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Philip

01:26:01.408 --> 01:26:28.606
[SPEAKER_10]: Titanjer is the new chief information security officer at PlayStation Network no word as to exactly what that person does however what I'm assuming is that he's going to make sure that system never gets hacked again because if it does get hacked again they'll probably hire someone new instead so yep apparently he's not just that but he's also going to be a senior vice president so I imagine he'll have a say in some of the higher level goings-ons of the companies so

01:26:29.006 --> 01:26:32.468
[SPEAKER_10]: He will be reporting to an executive VP in the company.

01:26:33.028 --> 01:26:46.436
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, Sony is making no really holdbacks saying that they are confirming that it's because of the PSN breach saying, quote, we are looking to bolster our network security even further.

01:26:47.256 --> 01:26:49.998
[SPEAKER_10]: So they are going to make sure that doesn't happen again.

01:26:50.698 --> 01:26:54.380
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if it does happen again, it's going to be really, really bad for everybody.

01:26:55.905 --> 01:27:04.432
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go back to a simpler time when the systems weren't being hacked and our credit card information wasn't saved on the console.

01:27:04.712 --> 01:27:07.634
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember when we had consoles and we didn't have to put our credit cards right on?

01:27:07.874 --> 01:27:11.297
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when your consoles didn't have the memory capacity to save anything?

01:27:11.377 --> 01:27:12.057
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

01:27:12.438 --> 01:27:18.302
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think this week's classic game did have a memory capacity of some sort, but it was about 16 blocks big.

01:27:18.322 --> 01:27:18.943
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it.

01:27:18.963 --> 01:27:19.043
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:27:22.085 --> 01:27:22.405
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

01:27:44.529 --> 01:27:49.715
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of on purpose, but this morning's conversation over breakfast really inspired.

01:27:49.935 --> 01:27:53.319
[SPEAKER_10]: So what is the classic game of the week that surprisingly has never come up before?

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.421
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy VII.

01:27:57.304 --> 01:28:00.868
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy VII came out, well it started development in 1994.

01:28:00.928 --> 01:28:04.252
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was supposed to be on the SNES and then to the Nintendo 64.

01:28:06.093 --> 01:28:11.997
[SPEAKER_07]: But when PlayStation came out, they hopped right on it because the Nintendo 64 couldn't handle the storage.

01:28:14.438 --> 01:28:20.861
[SPEAKER_07]: It was designed and produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi, and the music was by Uematsu Uchiyono.

01:28:20.901 --> 01:28:25.424
[SPEAKER_07]: But this was the first one that Yoshitaka Amano didn't do the character designs for.

01:28:25.924 --> 01:28:28.406
[SPEAKER_07]: It was done by Tetsuya Nomura.

01:28:29.786 --> 01:28:34.111
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, this is one of my favorite games of all time, for the record, I'll say.

01:28:34.951 --> 01:28:45.542
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so basically, you're this emo boy named Cloud with his hair in his face, and, uh, he goes around being pissed off and not so talkative, and he runs into this whole bag named Aerith.

01:28:47.223 --> 01:28:47.864
[SPEAKER_07]: Tifa, Vincent

01:29:02.597 --> 01:29:02.997
[SPEAKER_07]: And Yuffie?

01:29:03.157 --> 01:29:03.878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yuffie was fun?

01:29:04.038 --> 01:29:05.639
[SPEAKER_07]: And she had, like, the conformer?

01:29:06.219 --> 01:29:10.783
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I for real say, the first time I played through this game, I never got Vincent.

01:29:11.103 --> 01:29:15.286
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even know he was in the game, because I didn't... The internet wasn't really around in the back then.

01:29:15.306 --> 01:29:17.227
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it was, but nobody used it like they do now.

01:29:17.607 --> 01:29:25.632
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and it's... I didn't have Vincent, and I had Aerith in my party as one of, like, my main people that I would constantly use.

01:29:26.053 --> 01:29:28.754
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's just say I wasn't happy by the time this two rolled around.

01:29:28.935 --> 01:29:30.976
[SPEAKER_10]: I was legit... Like, I wasn't sad.

01:29:31.076 --> 01:29:31.716
[SPEAKER_10]: I was fucking mad.

01:29:33.157 --> 01:29:35.639
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my save file still where she dies.

01:29:35.939 --> 01:29:38.401
[SPEAKER_07]: Spoiler, she gets ganked by Sephiroth.

01:29:39.622 --> 01:29:42.163
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people were pissed off and sad.

01:29:42.203 --> 01:29:44.605
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Aerith.

01:29:44.785 --> 01:29:46.286
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a man-stealing ho-bag.

01:29:46.586 --> 01:29:51.910
[SPEAKER_10]: Aerith dies is kind of like the video game equivalent of Darth Vader as Luke's father.

01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:53.091
[SPEAKER_10]: He kills Dumbledore.

01:29:53.111 --> 01:29:54.171
[SPEAKER_10]: We all fucking know.

01:29:54.632 --> 01:29:54.912
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:29:56.293 --> 01:29:59.715
[SPEAKER_07]: But at any rate, it's one of my favorite games.

01:30:00.255 --> 01:30:02.297
[SPEAKER_07]: I bred Chocobos like you would not believe.

01:30:02.777 --> 01:30:08.999
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can breed chocobos and you race them and if you get the black chocobo it can run over the mountains.

01:30:09.459 --> 01:30:15.181
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get another one that runs over the oceans and then you can get the gold chocobo that runs over everything and then you get the airship.

01:30:16.021 --> 01:30:16.482
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh...

01:30:17.842 --> 01:30:28.568
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, you know, all the little drama, the little side stories, especially with Vincent, the whole Lucretia thing, being Sephiroth's mom and a bunch of crap.

01:30:29.248 --> 01:30:31.730
[SPEAKER_07]: But this game has some of my favorite music in it, too.

01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:33.651
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you should totally play.

01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:40.434
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, we'll go back from the battle sound there and check out, let's see, you marked this as your favorite song.

01:30:40.674 --> 01:30:41.615
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my favorite in the game.

01:30:44.737 --> 01:30:45.417
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a little bit of it.

01:30:47.695 --> 01:30:49.716
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first Jenova battle theme.

01:30:50.376 --> 01:30:52.937
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like my favorite music in the whole damn game.

01:30:53.797 --> 01:30:56.458
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my second favorite is actually more Jenova music.

01:30:56.838 --> 01:30:59.639
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that basically takes the battle theme and kind of redoes it.

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:00.860
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't mind.

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:02.020
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I'll go to that too.

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:02.801
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

01:31:03.121 --> 01:31:06.162
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll keep going with... Here we go.

01:31:06.182 --> 01:31:06.542
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a clip.

01:31:11.191 --> 01:31:14.372
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes it so minimalist and then just makes it super dramatic.

01:31:17.513 --> 01:31:19.354
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so you've got all these other characters.

01:31:19.734 --> 01:31:21.035
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Barret, who cusses.

01:31:21.875 --> 01:31:24.596
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sid, who has the best line in the whole game.

01:31:24.616 --> 01:31:27.437
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, sit down in your chair and drink your goddamn tea.

01:31:28.477 --> 01:31:52.670
[SPEAKER_07]: which ended up being quoted in like AOL chats for years and years and years and of course there's Red13 who is a kind of a lion-y looking guy and Katshi which for the record that is how it's pronounced because it's Celtic it's not Kate Sith it's Katshi so I'll let you know I'm muddying the whole internet now I love Kate Sith what are you talking about who ends up being like a Turk controlling the body and everything

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:57.762
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yeah, this, and of course, you know, there's Sephiroth, because, you know, Sephiroth is what you got.

01:31:58.102 --> 01:32:00.343
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, the story still makes no fucking sense to this day.

01:32:00.483 --> 01:32:01.004
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it does.

01:32:02.124 --> 01:32:20.492
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, because basically, it's like the whole Shinra, the big corporation in charge, is sucking the life dry out of the planet, and they're using the energy to do genetic experiments, and they're using, they find this alien thing that lands, and they're using that in their experiments too, hence Sephiroth, who's fucking crazy gonuts.

01:32:21.413 --> 01:32:21.933
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway...

01:32:23.408 --> 01:32:29.392
[SPEAKER_07]: He, uh, he decides he's gonna do what Jenova came to do, and that's destroy every fucking thing.

01:32:29.872 --> 01:32:30.913
[SPEAKER_07]: And Aerith's like, uh-uh, bitch.

01:32:31.733 --> 01:32:33.534
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though, you know, she's a hobag.

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:34.375
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

01:32:39.676 --> 01:32:40.837
[SPEAKER_07]: I got corrected by my husband.

01:32:40.857 --> 01:32:43.718
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan came in and said, sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:46.860
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:51.983
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, by the way, I did do a little bit of a double take the first time I was playing through this game and the game said shit.

01:32:52.043 --> 01:32:53.724
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, they can do that in games now?

01:32:54.205 --> 01:32:54.605
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently.

01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:56.006
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the PlayStation.

01:32:56.026 --> 01:32:56.126
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

01:32:58.068 --> 01:33:05.272
[SPEAKER_07]: So, at any rate, for a little bit more in the development side of that, basically, there are a lot of people involved in this.

01:33:05.312 --> 01:33:06.873
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a really big deal.

01:33:08.193 --> 01:33:13.696
[SPEAKER_07]: It was designed on Power Animator and Softimage 3D, which is early 3D.

01:33:14.236 --> 01:33:16.097
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, this is before my kids.

01:33:17.798 --> 01:33:21.360
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, before you could just download 3D software, you know, for fun.

01:33:22.191 --> 01:33:32.154
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, but they, the story was pretty much, um, pretty much how, what they had in mind for the Famicom, but they were able to develop it a lot more and bring the 3D in.

01:33:33.095 --> 01:33:36.195
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, they also included, um, previews of other games.

01:33:36.436 --> 01:33:43.658
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, basically the demo disc was a pack-in with Tobal number one in Japan, which Tobal number one was also a good game.

01:33:44.495 --> 01:33:46.997
[SPEAKER_07]: and I had previews of Bushido Blade and Saga Frontier.

01:33:48.378 --> 01:33:49.880
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were just lots of cool stuff.

01:33:49.900 --> 01:34:02.230
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a PC version that came out on Windows, but it was really, when it came out for systems at the time, it was really requirement heavy.

01:34:02.791 --> 01:34:05.733
[SPEAKER_07]: It really pushed systems and it played really slow.

01:34:05.873 --> 01:34:07.615
[SPEAKER_07]: It was molasses.

01:34:08.727 --> 01:34:17.471
[SPEAKER_07]: Although now I've found that people have done different patches for them where they have the Advent Children thing.

01:34:17.671 --> 01:34:23.113
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a whole Advent Children remake using the Final Fantasy VII PC version.

01:34:24.053 --> 01:34:25.334
[SPEAKER_07]: They've re-skinned, re-musiced.

01:34:26.294 --> 01:34:28.515
[SPEAKER_07]: They've done HD versions.

01:34:28.655 --> 01:34:29.416
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty crazy.

01:34:29.776 --> 01:34:35.218
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I saw someone actually going through and using the Unreal Engine to re-render whole scenes.

01:34:35.919 --> 01:34:51.059
[SPEAKER_07]: and I was hoping that someone was like there's a fan remake project out there too but they haven't really put anything concrete out there so I was really disappointed with that but I mean you've heard the music it's fantastic I've got the soundtrack it's wonderful

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:59.342
[SPEAKER_07]: Now there's a few things about this game that I got an old, I have a strategy guide that was based off the Japanese version.

01:35:00.082 --> 01:35:02.642
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really wanted to play the Japanese version for a while.

01:35:03.363 --> 01:35:07.524
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I finally got to borrow my friends and there's this little thing, I was telling you about it this morning, Rob.

01:35:08.324 --> 01:35:11.984
[SPEAKER_07]: These little things called Test Zero that look like blocky Dobermans.

01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:18.426
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you go into the Gold Saucer in the prison and go in the well, they hide out in the well, there's three of them, it's a random encounter.

01:35:19.186 --> 01:35:36.113
[SPEAKER_07]: and if you keep attacking them and attacking and attacking and attacking and attacking they will they'll just beg for their life the whole time and then when you kill them you get like a million experience so you can like power level but it's not in the US one I tried not in the US one

01:35:37.133 --> 01:35:40.954
[SPEAKER_07]: There were... This was in the days of dex files.

01:35:41.575 --> 01:35:46.376
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when you had the dex drives and you could download the memory card data.

01:35:48.317 --> 01:35:54.159
[SPEAKER_07]: I always got the Tifa date because I hated Aerith, but I downloaded a save file that had all the other dates.

01:35:54.519 --> 01:35:56.940
[SPEAKER_07]: You could do a date with Aerith, the Hobag.

01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:59.740
[SPEAKER_07]: You could do a date with Barret and a date with Yuffie.

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:02.381
[SPEAKER_07]: The Barret date was just funny.

01:36:02.581 --> 01:36:03.242
[SPEAKER_07]: Total bromance.

01:36:03.502 --> 01:36:03.742
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

01:36:05.683 --> 01:36:08.145
[SPEAKER_07]: And you play the whole game to find out that Cloud's fucking nuts.

01:36:09.145 --> 01:36:10.366
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sephiroth is even crazier.

01:36:11.267 --> 01:36:12.148
[SPEAKER_07]: And Aerith is dead.

01:36:12.908 --> 01:36:13.829
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is the best part of the game.

01:36:16.551 --> 01:36:21.234
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, there's been rumors of Squeenix doing a remake.

01:36:21.694 --> 01:36:24.937
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's people who said they would love to dedicate the time to it.

01:36:25.217 --> 01:36:27.879
[SPEAKER_07]: To do it with the Final Fantasy XIII style.

01:36:27.899 --> 01:36:29.240
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically doing it in Unreal Engine.

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.501
[SPEAKER_07]: There are other games related to the series.

01:36:32.521 --> 01:36:38.004
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Crisis Core, which is basically the tale of Zax and Chibi Cloud.

01:36:39.445 --> 01:36:43.327
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's Dirge of Cerberus, which is a shooting game.

01:36:43.827 --> 01:36:50.530
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, kind of first-person shooter-y, starring Vincent, which I sadly have but have not yet set down to play.

01:36:52.371 --> 01:36:53.932
[SPEAKER_07]: There were the phone games.

01:36:54.412 --> 01:36:54.793
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember?

01:36:54.893 --> 01:36:55.733
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

01:36:56.493 --> 01:36:57.094
[SPEAKER_07]: After Crisis?

01:36:57.114 --> 01:36:57.194
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:36:58.195 --> 01:36:58.736
[SPEAKER_03]: Before Crisis.

01:36:58.756 --> 01:37:00.758
[SPEAKER_07]: Before Crisis, that was it, yeah.

01:37:00.798 --> 01:37:02.500
[SPEAKER_07]: It was before Crisis.

01:37:04.102 --> 01:37:09.208
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's the Advent Children Complete, the DVD thing, which is awesome.

01:37:09.749 --> 01:37:15.335
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually the ending song has a cameo by Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance.

01:37:15.395 --> 01:37:15.776
[SPEAKER_07]: Just thought I'd...

01:37:16.169 --> 01:37:17.591
[SPEAKER_07]: Only in the Japanese version, which is stupid.

01:37:17.691 --> 01:37:18.031
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway.

01:37:20.074 --> 01:37:21.095
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one of the best games ever.

01:37:21.115 --> 01:37:28.363
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, Amano went back and did a lot of special art as promotional material for Final Fantasy VII.

01:37:29.504 --> 01:37:30.025
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh...

01:37:32.723 --> 01:37:36.184
[SPEAKER_07]: The only ones that I have of those are what's in my huge mungus Amano art book.

01:37:36.665 --> 01:37:37.985
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can find them online.

01:37:38.005 --> 01:37:38.405
[SPEAKER_07]: They're out there.

01:37:39.325 --> 01:37:41.186
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's Final Fantasy VII.

01:37:41.406 --> 01:37:46.128
[SPEAKER_07]: It's considered... I mean, I think VI was a more solid game.

01:37:47.448 --> 01:38:08.836
[SPEAKER_07]: but 7 is what sits on I'll put it this way I owned two games before I even had a Playstation that I could say was mine one of them was Final Fantasy 7 and the other one was Dragon Ball GT Final Battle which I wish I'd kept on held on to because it was worth money and I traded it for what's that?

01:38:09.457 --> 01:38:15.699
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue Stinger on Dreamcast for the Japanese version but that's it those are the two games I owned

01:38:16.534 --> 01:38:16.894
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:38:17.595 --> 01:38:17.955
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is.

01:38:17.995 --> 01:38:19.657
[SPEAKER_10]: Your classic game of the week, everybody.

01:38:20.918 --> 01:38:27.965
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy VII as we listen to DarkSakura and Dan have a fight about what they did and they didn't own.

01:38:30.107 --> 01:38:33.290
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lawn Show.

01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:34.150
[SPEAKER_10]: But don't go anywhere, you guys.

01:38:34.170 --> 01:38:40.977
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to come back for more of Orange Lawn Show with Part B where we're going to talk about one internet service provider might be throttling.

01:38:41.397 --> 01:38:42.918
[SPEAKER_10]: Your bandwidth when it comes to games.

01:38:43.278 --> 01:38:47.701
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, we're going to talk about some possible serious problems with the Wii U. It might not really work.

01:38:48.262 --> 01:38:48.862
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit.

01:38:49.342 --> 01:38:50.503
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, rapid fire news.

01:38:50.723 --> 01:38:56.187
[SPEAKER_10]: Your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR, your emails at mailbag at orangelandreale.com, and your calls on the Skype line.

01:38:56.347 --> 01:38:57.928
[SPEAKER_10]: All when we come back with more of Orange Landreale.

01:38:58.208 --> 01:39:07.534
[SPEAKER_10]: But before we go to our break tonight, I got to say, I believe Irene, unfortunately, is going to be leaving us because she's got like homework and like real world stuff.

01:39:08.095 --> 01:39:08.335
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

01:39:08.615 --> 01:39:09.135
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, jeez.

01:39:09.435 --> 01:39:10.896
[SPEAKER_10]: But thanks for sitting in on the show.

01:39:10.956 --> 01:39:13.557
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry you didn't get to talk too much, but... That's okay.

01:39:13.577 --> 01:39:14.137
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked enough.

01:39:14.617 --> 01:39:15.618
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice to hear from you.

01:39:15.738 --> 01:39:16.598
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be a stranger.

01:39:17.078 --> 01:39:17.278
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

01:39:17.479 --> 01:39:20.300
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any parting words you want to say to our listeners tonight?

01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:21.820
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, no.

01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:22.480
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

01:39:22.661 --> 01:39:23.301
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then get out.

01:39:23.321 --> 01:39:23.541
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

01:39:23.601 --> 01:39:24.021
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

01:39:24.961 --> 01:39:25.722
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thanks for being here.

01:39:25.902 --> 01:39:33.705
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe we'll hear you at least, if not on OLR in the future, maybe a future episode of Horde House or somewhere in the Orange Lounge Radio family of programming.

01:39:34.528 --> 01:39:34.889
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.

01:39:35.130 --> 01:39:35.430
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:39:35.771 --> 01:39:36.052
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:39:36.152 --> 01:39:36.372
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:39:36.773 --> 01:39:37.756
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

01:39:38.176 --> 01:39:39.820
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:42.506
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:48.976 --> 01:39:51.539
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:51.599 --> 01:39:59.066
[SPEAKER_10]: We are live on this Sunday evening, September the 11th of 2011, with the 427th episode of our show.

01:39:59.807 --> 01:40:04.031
[SPEAKER_10]: And we just had a fun Part A there, acknowledging the fact that it is Loki's birthday today.

01:40:04.131 --> 01:40:07.114
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you missed that in Part A, Irene showed up tonight.

01:40:07.174 --> 01:40:10.557
[SPEAKER_10]: She's left, sadly, but she brought Loki some bacon...

01:40:11.258 --> 01:40:12.599
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan, the man is here in studio joining us.

01:40:12.619 --> 01:40:13.620
[SPEAKER_10]: What have you been playing lately, Dan?

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.780
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan, of course, Dark Sakura's husband.

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.721
[SPEAKER_10]: What have you been up to?

01:40:15.741 --> 01:40:15.961
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working.

01:40:32.850 --> 01:40:34.191
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not playing games?

01:40:34.551 --> 01:40:35.692
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't got to play many games.

01:40:35.792 --> 01:40:36.792
[SPEAKER_10]: What is up with that?

01:40:36.873 --> 01:40:38.333
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's been saying that tonight.

01:40:38.373 --> 01:40:40.115
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been working too much to play games.

01:40:40.935 --> 01:40:41.595
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand, though.

01:40:41.635 --> 01:40:44.897
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you just recently started employment again and all that good stuff.

01:40:45.418 --> 01:40:45.938
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's good.

01:40:46.058 --> 01:40:46.579
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing.

01:40:46.919 --> 01:40:48.620
[SPEAKER_01]: I did just pick up a copy of Left 4 Dead 2.

01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:49.400
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:40:49.821 --> 01:40:55.004
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm too cheap to pay for Xbox Live after getting it for free for the last six years.

01:40:55.404 --> 01:40:55.704
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

01:40:55.824 --> 01:40:58.786
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm kind of like, oh man, three months is $25?

01:40:58.846 --> 01:40:58.926
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:41:00.467 --> 01:41:01.768
[SPEAKER_01]: Screw Xbox Live.

01:41:01.888 --> 01:41:03.609
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't you guys go over to PlayStation 3 then?

01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:07.132
[SPEAKER_01]: Because none of the people I play games with have a PlayStation 3.

01:41:07.632 --> 01:41:10.214
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I apologize.

01:41:10.254 --> 01:41:11.915
[SPEAKER_10]: I forget who said this in chat.

01:41:11.975 --> 01:41:16.998
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a question that came up and it scrolled by, but it was while DarkSakura was doing the Classic Game of the Week, so I couldn't bring it up.

01:41:17.519 --> 01:41:29.767
[SPEAKER_10]: But to summarize, the question was, if a game is available on multiple platforms, including PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, what goes into your decision to decide what console you get the game on?

01:41:30.507 --> 01:41:57.327
[SPEAKER_10]: and for me certainly price weighs into it and bonus features and things of that sort but it's really about like where are my friends playing and most of the time if it's online they're probably on Xbox Live but there have been games that I bought on PlayStation 3 for the simple fact I am not going to use the fucking Xbox controller to play this game my decision for playing some of these is who can I borrow it from I'm kind of the opposite I like the 360 controller

01:41:58.416 --> 01:41:58.736
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

01:41:59.117 --> 01:42:00.598
[SPEAKER_10]: But for some games I can't stand it.

01:42:00.618 --> 01:42:06.122
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Super Street Fighter 4, I bought it on the PlayStation 3 simply because I can't fucking stand the Xbox 360 controller for fighters.

01:42:06.142 --> 01:42:07.423
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why God made arcade sticks.

01:42:07.843 --> 01:42:09.724
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I don't want to buy an arcade stick.

01:42:10.285 --> 01:42:10.705
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you do.

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:12.026
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of do, you're right.

01:42:12.867 --> 01:42:13.247
[SPEAKER_01]: Told ya.

01:42:14.188 --> 01:42:16.810
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some games I would like to play with an arcade joystick.

01:42:18.271 --> 01:42:20.452
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so Left 4 Dead 2, gonna get back into that.

01:42:20.472 --> 01:42:21.213
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess you got some friends.

01:42:21.253 --> 01:42:22.534
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never really started on that.

01:42:22.634 --> 01:42:26.136
[SPEAKER_01]: I played the demo of both Left 4 Deads and I was always like...

01:42:27.509 --> 01:42:29.209
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like a first-person shooter.

01:42:30.230 --> 01:42:34.611
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like it might be kind of cool if I was playing with other people, but it's no fun to play by yourself.

01:42:35.151 --> 01:42:41.713
[SPEAKER_10]: I've watched Salacious Pop play a little bit of that, and it looks interesting, but I tried to play it, and I am fucking terrible at it.

01:42:41.873 --> 01:42:45.654
[SPEAKER_10]: You just need to find more people that have it in the system link.

01:42:45.834 --> 01:42:47.095
[SPEAKER_10]: It's such a team-based game.

01:42:47.235 --> 01:42:48.235
[SPEAKER_01]: I just bring the team down.

01:42:49.415 --> 01:42:51.896
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the problem is one of the people we're going to play with is in Washington.

01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:56.154
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't have that long of an Ethernet cable.

01:42:57.316 --> 01:43:00.560
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone has an 800-mile Ethernet cable, hook it up.

01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:03.664
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, XLink Kai, you can do that.

01:43:03.865 --> 01:43:05.507
[SPEAKER_09]: That's system link over the Internet.

01:43:05.767 --> 01:43:07.930
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, like the GameSpy tunnel thing they used to do?

01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.291
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:43:08.871 --> 01:43:09.092
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

01:43:09.793 --> 01:43:32.223
[SPEAKER_10]: but the one component that I have a hard time kind of defining like when I would buy a game for is the PC because I'm kind of like oh PC games are usually pretty niche and a lot of times like games I buy on the PC or only on the PC Diablo 3 would be a good example like although it's very likely Diablo 3 is coming to console I'm not gonna wait for it like I want it like when it fucking comes out so

01:43:32.663 --> 01:43:57.189
[SPEAKER_10]: and about Starcraft 2 on PC about Civilization 5 on PC those games only exist on PC the cross-platform stuff I tend to gravitate towards the consoles strictly because I like to curl up on the couch play the game like I don't know there's just PC games has a different maybe it's ridiculous I don't know but just like sitting in the office chair playing my PC games is not the same to me as being on the couch I love Steam all lazy

01:43:57.609 --> 01:44:03.970
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but then, yeah, and Steam will occasionally have those really fucking good sales that will make me want to buy a game on it.

01:44:04.631 --> 01:44:04.831
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

01:44:05.111 --> 01:44:05.671
[SPEAKER_08]: I was broken.

01:44:06.131 --> 01:44:06.291
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

01:44:06.831 --> 01:44:11.172
[SPEAKER_10]: But, like, Portal's a good example of a game I bought on PC because it was a really good fucking deal.

01:44:11.212 --> 01:44:12.832
[SPEAKER_07]: I prefer playing it on PC.

01:44:13.052 --> 01:44:15.733
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for me, it's just easier to control, even with my trackball mouse.

01:44:15.833 --> 01:44:17.353
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, that's a keyboard mouse thing, right?

01:44:17.433 --> 01:44:17.954
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:44:19.194 --> 01:44:19.954
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:44:19.974 --> 01:44:24.095
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Portal on my PC because it looked better, but I used a 360 controller.

01:44:24.275 --> 01:44:24.395
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

01:44:25.783 --> 01:44:27.304
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting, okay.

01:44:27.744 --> 01:44:30.005
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried playing it with a 360 controller and I just didn't like it.

01:44:30.325 --> 01:44:31.465
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't very intuitive to me.

01:44:31.485 --> 01:44:34.187
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I played DC Universe on the PC, but I played with a controller.

01:44:35.167 --> 01:44:38.588
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I was, you know, I was stuck on using a controller forever.

01:44:38.608 --> 01:44:40.969
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when I played Final Fantasy XI, I used a controller.

01:44:40.989 --> 01:44:43.731
[SPEAKER_07]: I had all my macros cued to my trigger buttons and everything.

01:44:44.531 --> 01:44:48.973
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played PSO, you know, with a controller.

01:44:49.293 --> 01:44:53.935
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't until I started playing World of Warcraft that I started playing keyboard and mouse.

01:44:55.163 --> 01:45:01.726
[SPEAKER_10]: Something that came up on this week's Horde House, plug, plug, the show I do all about, all things World of Warcraft at www.hordehouse.com.

01:45:01.766 --> 01:45:03.107
[SPEAKER_10]: Never too seriously, though, with Extifer.

01:45:03.887 --> 01:45:09.549
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things he brought up this week was that his brother-in-law likes to play World of Warcraft, I guess something he's been getting into, on a PS3 controller.

01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:11.070
[SPEAKER_10]: And, like, it actually kind of works.

01:45:11.130 --> 01:45:17.173
[SPEAKER_10]: And the way it, it's very similar to how Final Fantasy XI played on the PlayStation 2 controller, where you have to kind of macro things to buttons.

01:45:17.653 --> 01:45:18.673
[SPEAKER_10]: But it actually kind of works.

01:45:18.733 --> 01:45:20.074
[SPEAKER_10]: He was doing quests with them and everything.

01:45:20.094 --> 01:45:24.416
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the only thing that gets a little wonky, I think, he said was the camera gets a little weird.

01:45:24.736 --> 01:45:25.237
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see that.

01:45:25.417 --> 01:45:26.680
[SPEAKER_10]: But I found that to be very interesting.

01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:30.687
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, if he's fast enough with macro attacks, I bet using controller would make him really good for PvP.

01:45:31.778 --> 01:45:33.400
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, could be very interesting.

01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:35.682
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can't do PvP because I can't mouse turn with my mouse.

01:45:37.103 --> 01:45:40.126
[SPEAKER_07]: I just do hide in the corner while everyone else does PvP.

01:45:41.948 --> 01:45:43.489
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why the big battlegrounds are fun.

01:45:43.569 --> 01:45:44.110
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's why.

01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:45.151
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the big battlegrounds.

01:45:45.511 --> 01:45:50.916
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I guess it's really just a number of factors that go into the decision.

01:45:50.996 --> 01:45:54.720
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't sit here and say, oh, I would always go PS3 because I don't.

01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:55.721
[SPEAKER_10]: It just kind of...

01:45:56.221 --> 01:45:57.602
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's everyone else going to be?

01:45:57.702 --> 01:45:59.122
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of game is it?

01:45:59.202 --> 01:46:00.843
[SPEAKER_10]: Where am I going to be playing it the most?

01:46:01.223 --> 01:46:02.364
[SPEAKER_10]: All those things kind of weigh into it.

01:46:02.444 --> 01:46:06.565
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, I really just prefer almost anything on Xbox 360.

01:46:06.625 --> 01:46:12.868
[SPEAKER_07]: The controller feels pretty comfortable to my hand because I have to have a slightly wider reach on the PS3.

01:46:13.808 --> 01:46:18.330
[SPEAKER_07]: And the way that the little parts that stick out sit on my hand is because of my surgery, really.

01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:20.291
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's hard for me.

01:46:20.831 --> 01:46:21.451
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say this.

01:46:21.632 --> 01:46:31.217
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad I have the choice, and I realize not everyone invests in the 360 and the PS3 and a high-end PC capable of running today's games.

01:46:31.557 --> 01:46:40.402
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize not everybody can juggle all those things, but I like that I'm fortunate enough where I have been able to have all those so I can make the decision.

01:46:41.496 --> 01:46:45.117
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, I just got completely lightheaded once the sugar hit my brain.

01:46:45.597 --> 01:46:46.337
[SPEAKER_10]: From those cupcakes?

01:46:46.737 --> 01:46:47.077
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

01:46:47.257 --> 01:46:47.997
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

01:46:48.478 --> 01:46:49.138
[SPEAKER_07]: And my stomach aches.

01:46:49.158 --> 01:46:51.358
[SPEAKER_09]: The butter and the buttercream is kind of making me feel sick.

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:52.298
[SPEAKER_09]: I only ate one.

01:46:52.318 --> 01:46:52.979
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm eating it anyway.

01:46:53.039 --> 01:46:56.159
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a frappuccino on the way in here and that was enough sugar so I didn't need it.

01:46:56.239 --> 01:46:59.720
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get you the other lid for another lid for that other container.

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:02.681
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys all know how I feel about pumpkin and pumpkin spice frappuccinos.

01:47:02.901 --> 01:47:05.241
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a pumpkin spice muffin right the hell now.

01:47:05.781 --> 01:47:07.742
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've been wanting one since breakfast.

01:47:09.262 --> 01:47:11.624
[SPEAKER_10]: You better go now before all the Starbucks close.

01:47:13.065 --> 01:47:13.426
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

01:47:13.486 --> 01:47:18.770
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have had pumpkin at... No, because I didn't like the pumpkin at Pinkberry.

01:47:19.811 --> 01:47:21.012
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I love the pumpkin at Pinkberry.

01:47:21.032 --> 01:47:21.452
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good.

01:47:22.353 --> 01:47:23.194
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't as good.

01:47:23.254 --> 01:47:24.935
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, let's move on.

01:47:26.476 --> 01:47:27.577
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get into rapid fire news.

01:47:27.777 --> 01:47:28.938
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to gaming news.

01:47:29.178 --> 01:47:33.202
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of quick stories we want to talk about with you guys before we get to some of the other stuff.

01:47:35.243 --> 01:47:35.864
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, start us off.

01:47:37.094 --> 01:47:42.846
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like they did with the Resident Evil series, they're going to be bringing HD remakes of Devil May Cry 1, 2, and 3.

01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:46.710
[SPEAKER_09]: to the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

01:48:13.835 --> 01:48:16.318
[SPEAKER_09]: Look forward to an announcement I'm sure soon.

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:26.109
[SPEAKER_09]: And to kind of go along with that, Crysis, rumored to be coming to the new consoles, now has...

01:48:28.703 --> 01:48:32.245
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's going to be coming to the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this October.

01:48:33.025 --> 01:48:36.007
[SPEAKER_09]: Also coming, I believe, from a leak as well.

01:48:37.628 --> 01:48:39.989
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, these games are going to be remastered.

01:48:40.009 --> 01:48:42.450
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be also available in 3D.

01:48:43.291 --> 01:48:46.492
[SPEAKER_09]: And they announced that they're going to be 1,600 Microsoft points or 1,999.

01:48:49.194 --> 01:48:49.954
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

01:48:50.875 --> 01:48:51.675
[SPEAKER_09]: And those will be coming soon.

01:48:51.835 --> 01:48:53.756
[SPEAKER_09]: And the original price, this was a really good game.

01:48:53.836 --> 01:48:54.096
[SPEAKER_09]: Just...

01:48:55.897 --> 01:49:01.124
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't finish mine on the PC because, well, it wouldn't let me.

01:49:02.766 --> 01:49:03.487
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad glitches.

01:49:04.869 --> 01:49:09.675
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, last but not least, there's this trend, I wouldn't say it's a

01:49:11.092 --> 01:49:12.553
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:49:28.206 --> 01:49:28.947
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:49:44.068 --> 01:49:45.489
[SPEAKER_09]: and whatnot.

01:49:46.170 --> 01:49:57.539
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, apparently this guy had it happen and the police chief believes that the griefer is hacked into a 911 text messaging service to pull off the griefing.

01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:06.306
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have officers responding lights and sirens to a call they think is an emergency in progress and they get there only to find out it's a hoax.

01:50:07.807 --> 01:50:08.828
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fucked up.

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:13.972
[SPEAKER_09]: There's 100 documented cases so far the FBI is tracking.

01:50:14.933 --> 01:50:17.075
[SPEAKER_09]: All the way from Oregon through Florida.

01:50:18.976 --> 01:50:21.058
[SPEAKER_10]: That is so fucked up to do that.

01:50:21.078 --> 01:50:22.219
[SPEAKER_09]: Freaking juvenile.

01:50:22.259 --> 01:50:24.721
[SPEAKER_10]: That better fucking come around to bite these people in the ass.

01:50:24.741 --> 01:50:28.824
[SPEAKER_10]: Because not only is it just fucked up to do to somebody, but that is such a waste of money.

01:50:28.884 --> 01:50:32.227
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the police department, the fire department, they've got to take that shit seriously, you know?

01:50:32.647 --> 01:50:36.850
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's thousands of dollars of our money that's spent on these lols.

01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:38.632
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not fucking funny, you know what I mean?

01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:39.933
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just sad.

01:50:40.653 --> 01:50:41.394
[SPEAKER_10]: Very unfortunate.

01:50:41.834 --> 01:50:44.857
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I'd have to ask is how the fuck did they get the guy's address?

01:50:46.826 --> 01:50:47.926
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a very good question.

01:50:48.467 --> 01:50:51.848
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, probably more hacking of some sort.

01:50:52.748 --> 01:50:55.269
[SPEAKER_10]: Could it be as simple as the guys in the white pages?

01:50:55.869 --> 01:50:57.090
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that even exist anymore?

01:50:57.110 --> 01:50:58.050
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it does.

01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:59.051
[SPEAKER_10]: There are still phone books.

01:50:59.431 --> 01:51:02.952
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they drop a phone book off at my doorstep every once in a while.

01:51:03.272 --> 01:51:04.893
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a big advertisement for all the companies.

01:51:04.933 --> 01:51:05.573
[SPEAKER_09]: So you know what?

01:51:06.053 --> 01:51:09.855
[SPEAKER_09]: In the day and age that we live in right now with the internet, I just throw that shit in the garbage.

01:51:09.875 --> 01:51:10.895
[SPEAKER_10]: A phone book's a waste of money.

01:51:11.295 --> 01:51:11.935
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unfortunate.

01:51:12.836 --> 01:51:13.076
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

01:51:13.716 --> 01:51:14.797
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on to some more news.

01:51:15.358 --> 01:51:22.523
[SPEAKER_10]: The SimSocial we mentioned earlier, it is currently a more active game than FarmVille on Facebook.

01:51:22.563 --> 01:51:26.847
[SPEAKER_10]: So SimSocial has now actually surpassed FarmVille in the amount of daily active users.

01:51:27.207 --> 01:51:32.451
[SPEAKER_10]: The SimSocial is seeing an average of 9.3 million active users per day.

01:51:32.991 --> 01:51:37.175
[SPEAKER_10]: They play, on the average, three times a day in 15 to 20 minute increments.

01:51:37.195 --> 01:51:39.216
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, if you're DarkSakura, that's backwards.

01:51:39.256 --> 01:51:42.419
[SPEAKER_10]: She plays 15 to 20 times a day in three minute increments.

01:51:43.707 --> 01:52:09.777
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty true Okay, I'm not kidding Anyhow, Farmville still has 8.1 million people But the most popular game on Facebook right now Cityville, also by Zynga 13.9 million users a day The only app that gets more traffic than that Is Windows Messenger Live Which is somehow integrated into Facebook I've never even used that There you go What isn't said is how much fucking wall spam Has gone out because of this app

01:52:10.984 --> 01:52:14.265
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of those things I hate that I play it, but I can't stop playing ARG.

01:52:15.285 --> 01:52:16.725
[SPEAKER_09]: I would block people that did that.

01:52:16.926 --> 01:52:20.686
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a game that I can't be sad about enjoying because it's really fucking good.

01:52:20.746 --> 01:52:21.507
[SPEAKER_10]: LittleBigPlanet 2.

01:52:22.167 --> 01:52:26.148
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, so I haven't really played the sequel like I've played the original, but I will at some point.

01:52:26.288 --> 01:52:27.248
[SPEAKER_10]: It just went on sale.

01:52:27.288 --> 01:52:28.348
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to get it.

01:52:28.408 --> 01:52:31.489
[SPEAKER_10]: LittleBigPlanet 2 just got its Move patch.

01:52:32.089 --> 01:52:33.310
[SPEAKER_10]: I could loan it to you.

01:52:33.690 --> 01:52:34.630
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be great.

01:52:35.130 --> 01:52:46.360
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going live just yet until the Move Pack goes out, but Update 1.06 is out, which does release some new sensors, some limiting players on homebrew levels.

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:49.183
[SPEAKER_10]: You can control the basic game with the Move Controller now.

01:52:49.283 --> 01:52:58.150
[SPEAKER_10]: So all that stuff is setting up to take away for the Move Support officially in LittleBigPlanet 2, which comes with the Move Pack very, very, very soon.

01:52:59.391 --> 01:53:07.833
[SPEAKER_10]: Lastly, if you build games a little more seriously than LittleBigPlanet 2, not to say LittleBigPlanet isn't serious business, but this is real serious business.

01:53:08.473 --> 01:53:10.713
[SPEAKER_10]: Raw source code of popular games.

01:53:10.773 --> 01:53:11.433
[SPEAKER_10]: How popular?

01:53:11.913 --> 01:53:15.314
[SPEAKER_10]: Wolfenstein 3D Platinum and Doom Classic.

01:53:15.774 --> 01:53:16.574
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry, guys.

01:53:16.654 --> 01:53:17.534
[SPEAKER_10]: This is legit.

01:53:17.754 --> 01:53:20.535
[SPEAKER_10]: ID Software actually released the source codes themselves.

01:53:20.895 --> 01:53:22.935
[SPEAKER_10]: You can go get the source codes for these games.

01:53:24.135 --> 01:53:25.116
[SPEAKER_10]: And there you go.

01:53:25.196 --> 01:53:25.836
[SPEAKER_10]: It's update 2.1.

01:53:29.162 --> 01:53:42.442
[SPEAKER_10]: and you can go grab the source code and tinker away at that I'd be excited to see what kind of games come out of that I think the Wolfenstein code had been released before and this is some type of upgrade but there you go moving on DarkSakura what do you have for us

01:53:43.746 --> 01:53:44.726
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Max Technica

01:54:01.171 --> 01:54:04.273
[SPEAKER_07]: and that it's going to use both the touchscreen and the rear touch panel.

01:54:04.573 --> 01:54:05.074
[SPEAKER_07]: So who knows?

01:54:05.594 --> 01:54:11.818
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes a lot of sense considering that, you know, when I heard about this, I was like, oh yeah, because the game is basically on a giant touchscreen.

01:54:12.038 --> 01:54:13.239
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically Elite Beat Agents.

01:54:13.459 --> 01:54:13.679
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:25.426
[SPEAKER_07]: And then other news, Microsoft says 42% of US Xbox Live Gold members watch an average of an hour of video content a day.

01:54:26.426 --> 01:54:29.628
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's including Hulu Plus, Netflix and Zoom on Xbox 360.

01:54:29.668 --> 01:54:29.748
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:54:30.969 --> 01:54:36.091
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like there are going to be quite a bit more going on.

01:54:36.591 --> 01:54:47.354
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, it was reported by Terry Farrell, not to be confused with the lady that played Judzia Dax, who is the senior product manager of Xbox Live Entertainment.

01:54:47.954 --> 01:54:48.914
[SPEAKER_07]: This report comes from him.

01:54:49.094 --> 01:54:54.116
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to definitely be working to up that in the fall dashboard update.

01:54:55.717 --> 01:54:58.519
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, sad, sad, sad news.

01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:03.502
[SPEAKER_07]: Game writing pioneer Bill Kunkel passed away.

01:55:04.243 --> 01:55:04.803
[SPEAKER_07]: Very sad.

01:55:04.863 --> 01:55:06.384
[SPEAKER_07]: He died on September 4th.

01:55:07.045 --> 01:55:08.666
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the Game Doctor.

01:55:09.106 --> 01:55:10.627
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it sound familiar to anybody?

01:55:10.767 --> 01:55:16.231
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally remember the Game Doctor columns from the old magazines from back in the, oh God, that was the 80s.

01:55:16.251 --> 01:55:17.352
[SPEAKER_07]: Computer gaming world?

01:55:18.433 --> 01:55:19.814
[SPEAKER_10]: Video game computer entertainment, right?

01:55:20.314 --> 01:55:46.654
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep And the original Electronic Games, not to be confused with Electronic Gaming Monthly Yeah Oh yeah, I remember those magazines, we had them all That and the Commodore 64 magazines, but Bill wasn't a part of those I don't think Well, he was 61 years old And he'd been working on video game columns since 1978 And he co-founded EGM Wow He will be missed

01:55:48.350 --> 01:56:15.588
[SPEAKER_07]: as I understand it he was working right up until the unfortunate because the death was unexpected as I hear so he was still doing some work on websites and so forth so it's surprising it's very unfortunate I'm pulling up a list of other things that he worked on because he said he also did stuff for DC and Marvel actually also worked with KKWD Fog Studios Metropolis Media

01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:18.224
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of stuff.

01:56:19.605 --> 01:56:23.088
[SPEAKER_07]: And did a lot of the strategy guides for Prima.

01:56:24.128 --> 01:56:24.429
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

01:56:24.849 --> 01:56:33.256
[SPEAKER_07]: Maximum Carnage, Descent, FPS Baseball, Gex, Die Hard Trilogy, NFL Quarterback Club 98, Madden 64, and Brady.

01:56:33.696 --> 01:56:36.518
[SPEAKER_10]: So he was actually getting into game development at some point.

01:56:36.618 --> 01:56:38.700
[SPEAKER_07]: He did Madden 64 for a Brady game.

01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:39.661
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I see.

01:56:39.701 --> 01:56:39.941
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

01:56:39.961 --> 01:56:40.561
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

01:56:41.062 --> 01:56:41.382
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

01:56:41.582 --> 01:56:43.323
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, pretty crazy stuff.

01:56:44.064 --> 01:56:44.544
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too bad.

01:56:45.084 --> 01:56:45.725
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, too bad.

01:56:46.605 --> 01:56:46.926
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:56:47.426 --> 01:56:49.427
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's it for our quick news tonight.

01:56:49.507 --> 01:56:52.209
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's get back into more news.

01:56:52.610 --> 01:56:55.832
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why we have the quick news and the long news, but that's just the way we've been doing it.

01:56:56.252 --> 01:56:56.672
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

01:56:56.732 --> 01:56:57.633
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on, Loki.

01:56:59.714 --> 01:57:10.098
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you may remember that during Gamescom they announced that the PSP is going to be getting a new version out in Europe that was going to be Sans Wi-Fi.

01:57:10.759 --> 01:57:17.262
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm kind of wondering why they went ahead and did this seeing as the Vita is going to be coming out soon.

01:57:18.162 --> 01:57:21.685
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, one of the things that they're trying to do is target teens.

01:57:22.466 --> 01:57:23.606
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all for the audience.

01:57:23.646 --> 01:57:29.070
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're going to take PSP very young, teens and much younger, they're happy to just play the game.

01:57:29.290 --> 01:57:34.094
[SPEAKER_09]: If taking Wi-Fi out is the price to pay, we're happy to do it.

01:57:36.456 --> 01:57:42.160
[SPEAKER_09]: They also believe that the price point will give the console a much-needed sales bump, especially during the upcoming holiday season.

01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:49.582
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're saying that at, you know, 99 euro, it'll make a great Christmas gift.

01:57:50.502 --> 01:57:54.844
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the new system's dubbed the E1000.

01:57:54.924 --> 01:58:02.066
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I mean, if you're really looking for a PSP system, you can buy...

01:58:03.837 --> 01:58:04.237
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:28.984
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that, but they are connected to the internet.

01:58:29.124 --> 01:58:31.806
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like they're saying, well, teenagers are just happy to play the game.

01:58:32.267 --> 01:58:35.730
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, some of them are just happy to play the games, but you know what?

01:58:36.371 --> 01:58:45.179
[SPEAKER_09]: You can still buy one of your older PSP systems and have that functionality in there for the same price, if not cheaper.

01:58:45.796 --> 01:58:56.679
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you heard that whole, not to deviate too much from the story, but have you heard that whole story about how the kids at some schools in certain districts are now, instead of getting textbooks, they get iPads with the books on them?

01:58:57.460 --> 01:59:01.841
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, believe it or not, a $600 iPad or whatever, well, what's the lowest one cost?

01:59:01.861 --> 01:59:02.061
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe $400?

01:59:02.901 --> 01:59:06.822
[SPEAKER_10]: Those iPads are cheaper than some of the textbooks for all those classes combined.

01:59:07.262 --> 01:59:09.103
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the iPad is becoming a cheaper alternative.

01:59:09.503 --> 01:59:10.303
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crazy.

01:59:10.543 --> 01:59:11.364
[SPEAKER_09]: To the textbooks.

01:59:11.704 --> 01:59:11.864
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

01:59:12.364 --> 01:59:12.944
[SPEAKER_09]: How about this?

01:59:13.064 --> 01:59:22.628
[SPEAKER_09]: How about instead of spending $500 on an iPad, which granted is a good piece of technology, but how about you spend it on a cheaper e-reader and you can put those books on there?

01:59:22.648 --> 01:59:24.309
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, you can get HP touchpads for $100.

01:59:24.389 --> 01:59:26.310
[SPEAKER_10]: They should have got in on that deal.

01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:34.753
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if it's reading just books, that's all it's doing, I think there's cheaper alternatives out there than just that.

01:59:35.214 --> 01:59:36.214
[SPEAKER_09]: Or here's an idea.

01:59:37.677 --> 01:59:46.183
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much everybody nowadays in school and stuff, and I know that there's people out there that are without a substantial income.

01:59:46.964 --> 01:59:49.986
[SPEAKER_09]: But you gotta admit, most people probably have a PC at home.

01:59:50.927 --> 01:59:52.928
[SPEAKER_09]: The majority of people out there have a PC.

01:59:54.189 --> 01:59:56.551
[SPEAKER_09]: Just give it to them in a PDF format or something like that.

01:59:56.571 --> 01:59:58.172
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess if you're bringing it to school.

02:00:00.223 --> 02:00:05.106
[SPEAKER_09]: A desktop, you could have a desktop computer at each one of these desks.

02:00:05.166 --> 02:00:08.288
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot do now.

02:00:08.408 --> 02:00:12.031
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and then just have the book on there.

02:00:12.971 --> 02:00:13.331
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeez.

02:00:14.012 --> 02:00:19.375
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, going to our chatroom at chat.orange.com, taking you back to what the story was originally about before we got on that tangent.

02:00:19.896 --> 02:00:24.018
[SPEAKER_10]: Toagak in our chatroom says, you want to know what my PSP is used for?

02:00:24.038 --> 02:00:24.739
[SPEAKER_10]: 99% Wi-Fi, 1% games.

02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:28.021
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard that a lot.

02:00:28.121 --> 02:00:35.987
[SPEAKER_10]: Not so much the teenage crowd, but the college crowd really loves that the PSP is a web browser, an MP3 player, and it happens to play games.

02:00:36.368 --> 02:00:39.090
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've said this a million times on the show before.

02:00:39.110 --> 02:00:40.531
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm starting to sound like a broken record.

02:00:40.831 --> 02:00:44.474
[SPEAKER_10]: The PSP's biggest strength was always the fact that it didn't just do games.

02:00:44.514 --> 02:00:49.138
[SPEAKER_10]: It did, well, like their little tagline, it only does everything, and that really is Sony's strength.

02:00:49.758 --> 02:00:52.200
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to do much, though, when it doesn't have Wi-Fi.

02:00:52.561 --> 02:00:53.181
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

02:00:53.701 --> 02:00:55.463
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like, it only does nothing.

02:00:57.867 --> 02:00:58.807
[SPEAKER_10]: is what this system does.

02:00:59.087 --> 02:01:02.649
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't understand what the point is because they're all, well, help bump sales.

02:01:03.729 --> 02:01:10.171
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about the Europe region, but in the US and North America, there's not a lot of PSP games coming out.

02:01:10.371 --> 02:01:11.271
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like five.

02:01:11.871 --> 02:01:13.292
[SPEAKER_09]: Five for the whole fourth quarter.

02:01:14.293 --> 02:01:20.037
[SPEAKER_10]: I was fascinated to go to Fry's today as I was talking about before and see that they are still selling the PSP movies.

02:01:21.078 --> 02:01:22.559
[SPEAKER_10]: You can still buy PSP movies.

02:01:22.799 --> 02:01:26.342
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, probably got them for a good deal because no one's selling them anymore.

02:01:26.482 --> 02:01:28.384
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, five to ten bucks tops.

02:01:28.424 --> 02:01:32.427
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony was the only one for the longest time that was putting out movies on that system.

02:01:32.447 --> 02:01:35.669
[SPEAKER_09]: The last movie I remember on the UMD format was 2012.

02:01:36.170 --> 02:01:36.250
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

02:01:39.432 --> 02:01:42.734
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a Sony title, so obviously that makes sense why that would be on there.

02:01:42.874 --> 02:01:44.855
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it sort of makes sense.

02:01:45.295 --> 02:01:47.776
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, those things are dirt cheap now.

02:01:48.056 --> 02:01:49.957
[SPEAKER_09]: They're definitely not manufacturing them anymore.

02:01:49.997 --> 02:01:52.679
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, I don't understand the point.

02:01:52.699 --> 02:01:55.460
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, of course they want their system to sell well, but...

02:01:57.265 --> 02:02:18.850
[SPEAKER_09]: I think removing a pretty integral feature from the system that once again you know with the whole PSP Go and stuff you don't need to reinvent the system to help itself I mean why are you gonna spend more money on a system that does less I mean that's the whole point here why would I spend more money on a system that doesn't have Wi-Fi when I can yeah use this in preferred but you know what

02:02:20.905 --> 02:02:25.109
[SPEAKER_09]: Those so-called teenagers probably don't give a shit that it's a little bit used.

02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:29.153
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will come with games for less than that.

02:02:29.513 --> 02:02:31.735
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I think I was taking a look here.

02:02:31.955 --> 02:02:36.740
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw some used PSP systems on eBay.

02:02:37.981 --> 02:02:39.202
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see here.

02:02:39.882 --> 02:02:41.904
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got the Gigapack or whatever. $65.

02:02:43.866 --> 02:02:44.386
[SPEAKER_09]: and many more.

02:03:10.113 --> 02:03:12.595
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're region-free, so why not?

02:03:12.715 --> 02:03:14.276
[SPEAKER_09]: Or at this point, you might as well just wait for the Vita.

02:03:16.357 --> 02:03:16.658
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:03:16.858 --> 02:03:17.478
[SPEAKER_10]: Or get something else.

02:03:18.239 --> 02:03:20.820
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, moving on to a totally different topic.

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:24.043
[SPEAKER_10]: This is about not getting between somebody and their bandwidth.

02:03:24.083 --> 02:03:30.627
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, nothing gets the internet rabble-rabbled more than hearing about internet service providers and their recent restrictions.

02:03:31.107 --> 02:03:33.869
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this has to do with a Canadian provider, actually.

02:03:33.889 --> 02:03:39.413
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to do with Rogers Cable and Telcom, who's Canada's largest broadband provider.

02:03:39.873 --> 02:03:47.396
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, they had some complaints from World of Warcraft players saying that the World of Warcraft traffic was being throttled.

02:03:47.437 --> 02:03:49.517
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, oh my gosh, that just goes double so.

02:03:49.597 --> 02:03:54.140
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not get between, and I say this as a Warcraft player, do not get between me and my WoW.

02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:57.581
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not try to limit my bandwidth and lower my ping times.

02:03:58.161 --> 02:04:03.944
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was accusations that Rogers was apparently throttling the bandwidth and so forth.

02:04:04.624 --> 02:04:14.428
[SPEAKER_10]: Rogers has admitted that the game's online traffic might actually trip the monitors that kind of monitor this stuff and result in throttling.

02:04:14.488 --> 02:04:19.230
[SPEAKER_10]: They are calling this inadvertent, but that doesn't fix the problem.

02:04:20.011 --> 02:04:22.392
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess Canadian regulators have even gotten involved.

02:04:22.672 --> 02:04:25.853
[SPEAKER_10]: The Canadian Gamers Organization, I didn't even know that existed.

02:04:25.893 --> 02:04:26.493
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of cool.

02:04:26.833 --> 02:04:30.175
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually filed an inquiry into the practices of this company.

02:04:31.176 --> 02:04:39.863
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess what happens is because you've got the peer-to-peer traffic going on in World of Warcraft, it's being misclassified as something more nefarious.

02:04:40.184 --> 02:04:43.246
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, the same thing apparently is happening in Call of Duty Black Ops.

02:04:43.967 --> 02:04:51.874
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the rule is that if something is transmitting 80k BPS or more, it is what is enabling the throttling.

02:04:53.075 --> 02:04:58.259
[SPEAKER_10]: So, now Rogers says that the games can all run underneath that rate.

02:04:58.599 --> 02:05:03.202
[SPEAKER_10]: So, those who are experiencing the throttling must be running some type of other application with the gaming.

02:05:03.623 --> 02:05:07.005
[SPEAKER_10]: But I kind of sit there and go, well, what about like Ventrilo and some of the other stuff?

02:05:07.025 --> 02:05:11.448
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm notorious for playing WoW and surfing the web at the same time.

02:05:11.949 --> 02:05:15.271
[SPEAKER_10]: Just put a renew on somebody and then, you know, go alt tab and check my email.

02:05:15.972 --> 02:05:16.672
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

02:05:17.953 --> 02:05:19.814
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let's see.

02:05:20.454 --> 02:05:42.567
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the co-founder of the Canadian Gamer Organization said, "...rather than fixing the issue and actively whitelisting gaming systems to ensure they are not affected, Rogers is continuing to rely on consumer input and complaints rather than put forth the active testing needed to ensure compliance with CRTC policy.

02:05:42.967 --> 02:05:46.469
[SPEAKER_10]: We believe this approach is inappropriate under these circumstances."

02:05:46.969 --> 02:05:55.737
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Canadian Gamers Organization is going to ask for a new law requiring providers like Rogers to have a formal way for customers to report complaints.

02:05:56.358 --> 02:06:00.201
[SPEAKER_10]: So Canadians are pissed and you don't hear that very often.

02:06:00.842 --> 02:06:01.522
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:06:02.243 --> 02:06:05.206
[SPEAKER_07]: So now, honestly, I think I would be, too.

02:06:06.467 --> 02:06:06.707
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

02:06:06.747 --> 02:06:08.128
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't get between somebody in there.

02:06:08.148 --> 02:06:08.388
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

02:06:08.428 --> 02:06:09.009
[SPEAKER_10]: You just don't.

02:06:09.049 --> 02:06:09.549
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:06:09.569 --> 02:06:10.210
[SPEAKER_10]: Call of Duty.

02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:11.131
[SPEAKER_10]: Those people, you know.

02:06:12.613 --> 02:06:17.116
[SPEAKER_10]: The shitty thing is that it is legitimate use of the internet and it's being throttled.

02:06:17.316 --> 02:06:25.122
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand why they want to throttle bandwidth and so forth, but unfortunately, legit people pay the cost.

02:06:25.562 --> 02:06:26.323
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody else.

02:06:28.164 --> 02:06:29.665
[SPEAKER_10]: All the time, the common thing.

02:06:29.765 --> 02:06:32.107
[SPEAKER_10]: Same thing we've said about DRM time and time again.

02:06:33.748 --> 02:06:34.789
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to the emails.

02:06:35.635 --> 02:06:43.323
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelaundry.com DarkSakura's gonna dive into the email bag and pull out a few of her favorite emails.

02:06:43.683 --> 02:06:44.444
[SPEAKER_07]: Ew, it's so sticky!

02:06:46.164 --> 02:06:46.844
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, the first one.

02:06:47.384 --> 02:06:51.045
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi all, just wanted to point out that you could actually surf the net on the DS.

02:06:51.605 --> 02:06:53.725
[SPEAKER_07]: They just didn't release the attachments in the USA.

02:06:53.845 --> 02:06:57.686
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was in Japan, I bought it and it was one of the ones that used the GBA slot in a different way.

02:06:58.366 --> 02:07:03.407
[SPEAKER_07]: As for the 3DS versus Vita, well, I just got a 3DS.

02:07:03.447 --> 02:07:04.667
[SPEAKER_07]: The PSP never appealed to me.

02:07:04.767 --> 02:07:05.708
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the 3DS.

02:07:06.308 --> 02:07:13.109
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I did buy mine on eBay for $195 with 3DS games included and the Nintendo Ambassador program.

02:07:13.729 --> 02:07:19.673
[SPEAKER_07]: with the Vita, and by the way, it's V-I-T-A, not D-A.

02:07:21.754 --> 02:07:27.118
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have to pull off something really impressive because Netflix on my 3DS is awesome.

02:07:27.498 --> 02:07:31.581
[SPEAKER_07]: Not going to buy another system if the one I have now can do it already, and that's from Holly D.

02:07:33.422 --> 02:07:34.342
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, that is correct.

02:07:34.362 --> 02:07:41.826
[SPEAKER_10]: I could have sworn we would have made that clear, because I was aware that the DS had a web browser, but only on the DSs that had the eShop.

02:07:42.266 --> 02:07:44.967
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would start with the DSi and above.

02:07:45.267 --> 02:07:49.549
[SPEAKER_10]: However, but I do remember what I did forget, that Japan did have a cart.

02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:52.451
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually, I found one for sale at the local dimple.

02:07:52.771 --> 02:07:54.332
[SPEAKER_09]: The US also had a cartridge.

02:07:54.352 --> 02:07:54.972
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they really?

02:07:55.092 --> 02:07:55.353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

02:07:55.573 --> 02:07:56.433
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know that.

02:07:56.573 --> 02:07:58.534
[SPEAKER_09]: It came with a memory expansion slot.

02:07:58.855 --> 02:08:00.896
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a memory expansion that goes in the Game Boy Advance slot.

02:08:00.916 --> 02:08:03.297
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I did forget about the browser and the cartridge.

02:08:03.377 --> 02:08:04.758
[SPEAKER_10]: But still terrible.

02:08:04.878 --> 02:08:07.199
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like browsing the web on the 3DS either.

02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:08.620
[SPEAKER_10]: It is terrible.

02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:09.261
[SPEAKER_10]: It's clunky.

02:08:09.301 --> 02:08:09.621
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:08:09.901 --> 02:08:11.162
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, moving forward.

02:08:11.382 --> 02:08:12.142
[SPEAKER_10]: Needs to be optimized.

02:08:12.362 --> 02:08:12.543
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

02:08:13.583 --> 02:08:13.883
[SPEAKER_07]: Evening.

02:08:14.304 --> 02:08:18.026
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have sent this last week, but didn't realize you had a Labor Day weekend show.

02:08:18.686 --> 02:08:21.848
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, I see the mobile game Flight Control is now available for WiiWare.

02:08:22.388 --> 02:08:28.292
[SPEAKER_07]: Fairly nice to have this one on a full display with local multiplayer, although the lack of verses is somewhat disappointing.

02:08:28.792 --> 02:08:32.434
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, it really puts the infamous Wii Remote jitter...

02:08:34.375 --> 02:08:35.475
[SPEAKER_07]: Jitterfront and Center.

02:08:35.936 --> 02:08:36.176
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

02:08:36.896 --> 02:08:40.537
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe last year FireMint was supposed to have a PS Move version of the game.

02:08:40.897 --> 02:08:42.978
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they say why this never came out in North America?

02:08:43.038 --> 02:08:46.539
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's from Robert M. No, and I gotta admit, I'm not very familiar with that game.

02:08:46.559 --> 02:08:47.299
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it called again?

02:08:47.379 --> 02:08:48.199
[SPEAKER_10]: Flight Control?

02:08:48.859 --> 02:08:49.599
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

02:08:49.639 --> 02:08:51.440
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, is this a game you know about?

02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:59.482
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Flight Control is one of those air traffic controller games where you control the different planes that are taking off and stuff.

02:08:59.502 --> 02:09:01.043
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they have that kind of stuff on the iPod.

02:09:01.063 --> 02:09:02.223
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have been a WiiWare game.

02:09:02.583 --> 02:09:04.104
[SPEAKER_07]: It said it was originally a mobile game.

02:09:05.205 --> 02:09:07.787
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at a trailer here for the game.

02:09:08.628 --> 02:09:11.210
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so visual I need to see this here.

02:09:14.473 --> 02:09:14.693
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh!

02:09:15.233 --> 02:09:15.594
[SPEAKER_10]: See?

02:09:15.774 --> 02:09:18.476
[SPEAKER_10]: Once I see it, this is based on an iPad game.

02:09:19.537 --> 02:09:23.880
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where you draw the path of the planes and you don't want them to collide.

02:09:24.181 --> 02:09:25.322
[SPEAKER_10]: This is based off an iPad game.

02:09:27.677 --> 02:09:28.558
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I just had to see it.

02:09:29.058 --> 02:09:29.819
[SPEAKER_10]: I do know this game.

02:09:30.839 --> 02:09:33.521
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that they had ported it to anything besides the iPad.

02:09:33.561 --> 02:09:34.522
[SPEAKER_10]: That part's news to me.

02:09:37.324 --> 02:09:37.844
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

02:09:38.105 --> 02:09:41.567
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I don't know the other answer to your question.

02:09:41.607 --> 02:09:42.007
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

02:09:42.568 --> 02:09:45.009
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you're going to need to pull up this email because apparently there's a YouTube link.

02:09:45.029 --> 02:09:46.410
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to copy it to you.

02:09:46.851 --> 02:09:48.172
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just copy the YouTube link to me.

02:09:48.432 --> 02:09:52.635
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will read you the... Let me just paste it to you real quick.

02:09:52.655 --> 02:09:52.735
Sure.

02:09:55.029 --> 02:09:57.030
[SPEAKER_10]: Live Radio Kids, that's what we're all about here.

02:09:57.550 --> 02:09:58.290
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm fast.

02:09:59.110 --> 02:10:00.131
[SPEAKER_07]: With my damn trackball.

02:10:00.551 --> 02:10:01.771
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I play it now or when you say?

02:10:02.652 --> 02:10:04.512
[SPEAKER_07]: After this, I'll go ahead and read this.

02:10:04.933 --> 02:10:06.653
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo homies, Xenocore here.

02:10:07.353 --> 02:10:11.415
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sad that I just discovered this song, but you must use this for Listless this Sunday.

02:10:12.195 --> 02:10:12.535
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

02:10:13.776 --> 02:10:15.856
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from the Rubber Bandits, Horse Outside.

02:10:16.297 --> 02:10:18.577
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't use the clean version, this song is freaking awesome.

02:10:18.777 --> 02:10:20.078
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're talking about Cage Match.

02:10:20.838 --> 02:10:22.399
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, it's probably Cage Match.

02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:24.020
[SPEAKER_07]: But, hey.

02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:24.681
[SPEAKER_00]: Dudes with accents.

02:10:24.701 --> 02:10:26.262
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me forward a little bit here.

02:10:26.282 --> 02:10:29.304
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think this is something for the Cage Match segment, not the... Veto!

02:10:29.324 --> 02:10:29.564
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

02:10:29.584 --> 02:10:30.785
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check it out later.

02:10:30.845 --> 02:10:31.005
[SPEAKER_00]: Veto.

02:10:31.025 --> 02:10:32.086
[SPEAKER_00]: Not when we're live on air.

02:10:50.250 --> 02:10:50.670
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's it.

02:10:51.171 --> 02:10:51.571
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it?

02:10:51.891 --> 02:10:52.212
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

02:10:52.292 --> 02:10:53.072
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more emails.

02:10:53.112 --> 02:10:57.116
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the other one was someone trying to get us to, like, post his stuff, and I'm like, no.

02:10:57.636 --> 02:10:59.718
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com.

02:10:59.758 --> 02:11:00.398
[SPEAKER_10]: Free plugs.

02:11:01.619 --> 02:11:02.600
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to disguise your free plugs.

02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:03.321
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not free.

02:11:03.561 --> 02:11:03.801
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:11:05.503 --> 02:11:05.823
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:11:06.143 --> 02:11:09.306
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to the part of the show where we... It costs a lot of money to be this cheap.

02:11:10.467 --> 02:11:12.909
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to the part of the show where we get ranty.

02:11:12.949 --> 02:11:16.492
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the FUs of the week, and we do them here on the show because we can.

02:11:32.962 --> 02:11:36.005
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to finding out about emo crap during the show.

02:11:37.046 --> 02:11:37.366
[SPEAKER_07]: Puh.

02:11:39.008 --> 02:11:39.288
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

02:11:39.889 --> 02:11:41.390
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you, my cat, for being an asshole.

02:11:43.946 --> 02:11:45.287
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I don't know.

02:11:45.767 --> 02:11:47.829
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to the fact that this weekend was shorter than last week.

02:11:47.889 --> 02:11:50.150
[SPEAKER_10]: No, F you to the three hour nap I took yesterday.

02:11:50.451 --> 02:11:54.493
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the first weekend in forever where I had literally nothing planned on Saturday.

02:11:54.553 --> 02:11:57.075
[SPEAKER_10]: It was amazing to just sit at home all day and veg.

02:11:57.515 --> 02:11:58.156
[SPEAKER_10]: But what did I do?

02:11:58.256 --> 02:12:00.477
[SPEAKER_10]: I napped literally the whole damn day away.

02:12:01.078 --> 02:12:02.759
[SPEAKER_10]: But I feel really rested and I feel great.

02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:04.880
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I guess I needed it.

02:12:05.781 --> 02:12:07.422
[SPEAKER_10]: But F you to what felt like a wasted day.

02:12:08.803 --> 02:12:16.934
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, a few more news stories for you guys, then we're going to open it up to you guys via Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:12:16.974 --> 02:12:19.277
[SPEAKER_10]: But don't call yet, because we still have a few more stories to get through.

02:12:20.218 --> 02:12:21.881
[SPEAKER_09]: Origin has been doing pretty well.

02:12:22.241 --> 02:12:23.242
[SPEAKER_09]: EA's new...

02:12:25.305 --> 02:12:25.686
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

02:12:42.846 --> 02:12:45.608
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be adding third-party content very soon.

02:12:46.569 --> 02:12:57.618
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, they're saying that it will use its collection of 130 million users and various payment methods to attract third-party games to Origin.

02:12:59.079 --> 02:13:00.720
[SPEAKER_09]: So, wait a second.

02:13:01.421 --> 02:13:05.724
[SPEAKER_09]: So what they're saying is they have 4 million client installs, yet 130 million users?

02:13:05.744 --> 02:13:05.804
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

02:13:09.056 --> 02:13:10.197
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't really make sense to me.

02:13:11.577 --> 02:13:11.857
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

02:13:12.418 --> 02:13:16.039
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they're talking about maybe their electronic arts site.

02:13:16.139 --> 02:13:24.163
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, like when you do Dragon Age and stuff, you have to sign up for their stupid online thing.

02:13:24.203 --> 02:13:26.444
[SPEAKER_09]: I like how they count all those players in there.

02:13:27.064 --> 02:13:28.265
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have a choice.

02:13:28.365 --> 02:13:31.866
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to sign up on that site in order to play those games.

02:13:31.926 --> 02:13:34.348
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like, oh, I love EA.

02:13:34.508 --> 02:13:37.289
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to totally register an account with them because...

02:13:38.001 --> 02:13:42.682
[SPEAKER_09]: They're awesome, and I love their products, and you have no choice.

02:13:43.562 --> 02:13:44.722
[SPEAKER_09]: But I like how they skew that.

02:13:44.942 --> 02:13:45.542
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

02:13:47.063 --> 02:13:57.465
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, there's some information from Origin regarding a new remake of Syndicate, that series.

02:13:58.085 --> 02:14:04.806
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, it's going to be done by the developer Starbreeze, who did Escape from Butcher Bay and The Darkness.

02:14:06.968 --> 02:14:09.211
[SPEAKER_09]: and I guess they're showing off some stuff.

02:14:11.553 --> 02:14:13.234
[SPEAKER_09]: Some stuff, I guess, leaked out from their website.

02:14:13.875 --> 02:14:15.056
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks interesting.

02:14:15.276 --> 02:14:19.459
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying the story's penned by the guy that did the Crisis 2 script.

02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:22.382
[SPEAKER_09]: And he also wrote some books and stuff.

02:14:22.922 --> 02:14:29.828
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, that it's supposed to debut next week in the Game Reactor magazine, which is a Swedish publication.

02:14:30.949 --> 02:14:33.571
[SPEAKER_09]: And, I don't know, it looks kind of cool.

02:14:33.891 --> 02:14:36.033
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I guess...

02:14:37.881 --> 02:14:44.445
[SPEAKER_09]: Check out the EA Origins store if you want to catch some details on that or just check out the web because it's leaked out.

02:14:47.346 --> 02:14:47.706
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:14:48.787 --> 02:14:52.929
[SPEAKER_10]: I have yet to use the Origins store, but I remember we got a call last week saying it's not that bad, you guys.

02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:59.072
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is interesting that it has so many installs, but isn't that because it's kind of forced on people?

02:14:59.913 --> 02:15:00.193
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:15:00.407 --> 02:15:03.471
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Origin, I mean, some of it's probably voluntary.

02:15:03.531 --> 02:15:10.320
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it was, didn't it become Origin like it was something else and then it just translated over to Origin?

02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:18.209
[SPEAKER_10]: God, whenever, well, whenever I hear Origin, I think about the old school publishing house or studio that would make games, like the old Ultimate games were all Origin.

02:15:18.250 --> 02:15:19.231
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that's what this is.

02:15:19.591 --> 02:15:20.552
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no, no.

02:15:20.612 --> 02:15:21.593
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Steam.

02:15:21.814 --> 02:15:22.535
[SPEAKER_10]: This is their Steam.

02:15:22.895 --> 02:15:27.260
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I understand that, but Origin was that company, and now it's the site.

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:31.384
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, EA sucked them up and then never used the name, and now they just brought back the name for this.

02:15:31.465 --> 02:15:34.148
[SPEAKER_10]: But the two uses of the name have nothing to do with each other.

02:15:35.269 --> 02:15:35.910
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

02:15:36.370 --> 02:15:37.131
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, it makes sense.

02:15:39.133 --> 02:15:44.896
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, Wii U, this has been some big news talking about this week.

02:15:45.137 --> 02:15:53.661
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, while this reeks of being a rumor, this is coming from that French site that's been getting a lot of smoking guns lately.

02:15:53.862 --> 02:16:00.365
[SPEAKER_10]: They've become quite the site to get the early gossip because they leaked the news about the Vita, right?

02:16:00.505 --> 02:16:00.846
[SPEAKER_10]: I think.

02:16:01.206 --> 02:16:04.988
[SPEAKER_10]: They leaked the news about the extra thing on the 3DS, which now we have a picture of.

02:16:05.388 --> 02:16:06.709
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they're talking about this.

02:16:06.809 --> 02:16:17.779
[SPEAKER_10]: This, so take it with a grain of salt, but it's very interesting regarding the Wii U. Apparently, they're saying that Nintendo is having big problems getting the Wii U up and running.

02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:22.503
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, the Wii U is not up to wanting to do what Nintendo needs it to do.

02:16:22.904 --> 02:16:28.008
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just running the console, but beaming the data to the touchscreen controller as well.

02:16:28.028 --> 02:16:31.552
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, developers that are working on the console, they use tethers,

02:16:32.012 --> 02:16:37.255
[SPEAKER_10]: To ensure that the communication, so basically it has to do with the wireless aspect of it.

02:16:37.535 --> 02:16:42.938
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now the developers have to use a wire to the controller to make sure the information gets across fast enough.

02:16:43.959 --> 02:16:46.860
[SPEAKER_10]: Even then, apparently things aren't still working out that well.

02:16:47.181 --> 02:16:51.603
[SPEAKER_10]: Progress is halted daily with repeated software updates for the pad.

02:16:52.143 --> 02:16:53.084
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm, interesting.

02:16:53.785 --> 02:16:58.072
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, apparently these problems are causing a delay in the console's launch.

02:16:58.472 --> 02:17:02.699
[SPEAKER_10]: Originally, they had been looking at June 2012, but now they're saying September 2012, which to me...

02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:08.754
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally, I would have said, well, that was the time frame I was thinking for the system anyway.

02:17:08.774 --> 02:17:11.116
[SPEAKER_10]: So that doesn't seem like such a huge setback.

02:17:11.736 --> 02:17:14.739
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, obviously, you can't prove these allegations.

02:17:14.919 --> 02:17:19.183
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo, even though the blogs are trying to get them to comment, they're not going to.

02:17:19.203 --> 02:17:21.165
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to say, we don't comment on rumors and speculation.

02:17:21.505 --> 02:17:27.551
[SPEAKER_10]: But it definitely kind of says, hmm, maybe this is not going to be ready by the time it needs to be.

02:17:27.551 --> 02:17:28.071
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to say.

02:17:28.171 --> 02:17:28.952
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not good.

02:17:28.972 --> 02:17:29.432
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't know...

02:17:52.102 --> 02:17:55.065
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't know if it's really going to end up being true.

02:17:55.145 --> 02:17:59.809
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, they're not going to launch the system if it's not going to work.

02:17:59.829 --> 02:18:01.991
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if flat doesn't work, they're not going to launch it.

02:18:02.051 --> 02:18:06.135
[SPEAKER_10]: But might they have to downgrade it a little bit to get it to work?

02:18:06.395 --> 02:18:08.457
[SPEAKER_10]: Or I guess it could go the other way around.

02:18:08.477 --> 02:18:10.378
[SPEAKER_10]: They'd have to upgrade it to get it to work too, huh?

02:18:10.418 --> 02:18:11.920
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure which way it goes.

02:18:11.980 --> 02:18:16.324
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you downgrade the processing power so that way there's not as much data to transmit?

02:18:16.444 --> 02:18:17.424
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do you upgrade?

02:18:18.245 --> 02:18:19.967
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's finding the balance.

02:18:20.467 --> 02:18:36.694
[SPEAKER_10]: but it is interesting that the PlayStation 3 kind of does this with the PSP right now it's a little lag though I mean it wouldn't the technology has to get a little bit better than that I don't know how it's going to work with the PS3 and the Vita but you know it's a little bit laggy and obviously they don't want that on the Wii U

02:18:37.523 --> 02:18:41.027
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm wondering, though, what it uses.

02:18:42.148 --> 02:18:45.051
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was just looking this up.

02:18:45.311 --> 02:18:46.393
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a theory here.

02:18:46.413 --> 02:18:54.381
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why we may be seeing the whole 3DS getting a second analog stick is maybe they're just not going to put out the controller at all.

02:18:55.541 --> 02:18:56.061
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:19:16.584 --> 02:19:16.824
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe?

02:19:16.844 --> 02:19:17.364
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:19:17.625 --> 02:19:19.706
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting comment from Imaginomicon in chat.

02:19:20.046 --> 02:19:22.907
[SPEAKER_10]: In all fairness, Kinect had basically the same situation.

02:19:23.007 --> 02:19:27.309
[SPEAKER_10]: That is, it couldn't do what they initially advertised and was eventually gimped.

02:19:27.709 --> 02:19:32.372
[SPEAKER_10]: Weren't there early rumors about the Kinect that the Kinect couldn't see certain races and things like that?

02:19:32.472 --> 02:19:34.973
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's not true, though.

02:19:35.413 --> 02:19:39.035
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that was just bad PR for Microsoft.

02:19:39.075 --> 02:19:40.355
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it can't see black people.

02:19:40.596 --> 02:19:41.496
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's not true.

02:19:42.048 --> 02:19:44.271
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, obviously I can now, but, you know.

02:19:44.431 --> 02:19:45.733
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it could before.

02:19:45.773 --> 02:19:50.318
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just like if you're playing on, you know, it depends on where you're playing.

02:19:50.338 --> 02:19:53.162
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're playing with something with a lot of light interference or, you know, if it's...

02:19:54.794 --> 02:19:58.236
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't play Connect in the Dark either.

02:19:58.296 --> 02:20:01.598
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you gotta have some, you know, some light.

02:20:01.618 --> 02:20:09.342
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it was stupid because it was like, well, actually, it won't detect anybody in those lighting conditions and not necessarily just people of a certain race.

02:20:09.462 --> 02:20:11.724
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, that was just...

02:20:12.324 --> 02:20:29.330
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do seem to recall that it seemed like the Kinect... I want to say there was a story about how they did have to kind of change the Kinect too, so... Well, I think they dropped the resolution down so they could have more bandwidth to go between the sensor and the system, but...

02:20:31.019 --> 02:20:31.700
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:51.481
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand why it's not possible.

02:20:51.642 --> 02:20:58.806
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can do it on the PSP, but you can do it on the PSP over the internet and over that 802.11g.

02:20:59.086 --> 02:21:07.872
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe, like I said before, more bandwidth there and allow you to be able to do what you can't do on the console.

02:21:07.912 --> 02:21:11.655
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, why couldn't you make the controller connect to your Wi-Fi network?

02:21:12.255 --> 02:21:13.536
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, then you can even add it.

02:21:13.576 --> 02:21:18.800
[SPEAKER_09]: So, hey, look, you can surf the web on this controller, but it's not going to let you do that.

02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:24.122
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well let's move on with a few more stories before we get to the Twitter topics and phone calls.

02:21:24.182 --> 02:21:27.544
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm expecting to hear about this and some phone calls tonight.

02:21:27.964 --> 02:21:28.785
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, next story.

02:21:29.845 --> 02:21:33.527
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about the scariest Xbox 360 game?

02:21:33.567 --> 02:21:34.407
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think it would be?

02:21:36.588 --> 02:21:38.549
[SPEAKER_09]: Scariest Xbox 360 game?

02:21:39.330 --> 02:21:39.650
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:21:40.865 --> 02:21:45.148
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it looks that the major vote goes for Dead Space 2.

02:21:45.248 --> 02:21:50.151
[SPEAKER_07]: That that is considered to be the scariest game.

02:21:51.111 --> 02:22:06.121
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is coming just ahead of what they did is they actually tested core and casual gamers' heart rate, sweat levels, and body temperature while playing Alan Wake, Resident Evil 5, Dead Space 2, and Condemned.

02:22:06.201 --> 02:22:08.242
[SPEAKER_09]: It was sad that Yaris wasn't included in there.

02:22:10.099 --> 02:22:12.781
[SPEAKER_07]: That would have been nausea-inducing, not scary.

02:22:13.881 --> 02:22:14.941
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Connectimals?

02:22:15.001 --> 02:22:16.462
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of those fuckers are pretty frightening.

02:22:16.782 --> 02:22:23.265
[SPEAKER_07]: They said that core gamers dealt better with the scares than the apparently wussy casual players.

02:22:23.925 --> 02:22:28.787
[SPEAKER_07]: But they all experienced rapidly increased heart rate, stunted breathing, and a rise in skin temperature.

02:22:30.608 --> 02:22:30.768
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

02:22:33.502 --> 02:22:37.103
[SPEAKER_07]: There were pretty vocal about some of it too.

02:22:37.223 --> 02:22:40.244
[SPEAKER_07]: Like one of them started screaming, oh my god, oh my god, this shit is so scary.

02:22:40.264 --> 02:22:45.125
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like Shane when they're playing Silent Hill or something.

02:22:45.865 --> 02:22:55.428
[SPEAKER_07]: Other games that were considered but not found scary enough were Left 4 Dead 2, Gears of War 2, Condemned 2, Fear 1 and 2, Dead Space 1, and Silent Hill Homecoming, Alone in the Dark, and Mass Effect 2.

02:22:58.318 --> 02:23:26.040
[SPEAKER_10]: I told you about how Silent Hill Homecoming made me basically scream like a little girl and go shut the front door that had blown open from the wind and oh my god that was a horrible night hearts like who sits at home alone in the dark and plays Silent Hill you're just asking for it remember when Miklatov was visiting a while back and played through Silent Hill 2 and we were all curled up in your living room like on the couch in the dark watching him play I don't think I was in there

02:23:26.977 --> 02:23:27.878
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, you weren't.

02:23:27.918 --> 02:23:28.498
[SPEAKER_07]: You weren't there.

02:23:28.638 --> 02:23:36.022
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there, and it was like, I think Irene was there, and Eddie, I think Eddie was there.

02:23:37.382 --> 02:23:38.143
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it was pretty funny.

02:23:39.483 --> 02:23:42.665
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Christopher was there, because it was when you were living with Christopher.

02:23:42.965 --> 02:23:44.606
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, no, I probably just was out.

02:23:44.926 --> 02:23:45.466
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you were gone.

02:23:46.567 --> 02:23:51.149
[SPEAKER_10]: I was probably on a hot date while you nerds were playing Silent Hill.

02:23:52.310 --> 02:23:53.130
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that shit was awesome.

02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:54.771
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Loki.

02:23:56.116 --> 02:24:02.462
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so of course, you know, one of the pioneers of Project $10 was EA.

02:24:03.023 --> 02:24:09.589
[SPEAKER_09]: And EA's been doing this for a while now, since June of last year, starting with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.

02:24:10.570 --> 02:24:20.039
[SPEAKER_09]: They were including basically a voucher in their new games that allowed you to get, you know, online access, their online pass, if you will.

02:24:20.899 --> 02:24:29.023
[SPEAKER_09]: and if you bought the game used, well, that might not be in there and so you would have to pay $10 to be able to play online.

02:24:29.143 --> 02:24:34.865
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, EA has come out and said that they have made between $10 and $15 million from online pass and

02:24:41.569 --> 02:24:52.337
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently the revenues they said that they derived from that haven't been dramatic since they initiated the program, but it's not a failure at all.

02:24:53.077 --> 02:24:57.260
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you consider that, that's spread across quite a few games.

02:24:58.201 --> 02:25:03.425
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Woods, NCAA football, both years for NCAA football and Madden.

02:25:03.705 --> 02:25:04.946
[SPEAKER_10]: EA does a lot of sports games.

02:25:05.066 --> 02:25:05.867
[SPEAKER_09]: EA, MMA...

02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:09.788
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:25:33.809 --> 02:26:01.313
[SPEAKER_09]: and really they only have to that's you know 1 million about 1 million people that have bought into this so split that across you know over 5 games or whatever that's you know quite a significant amount I guess but 200,000 per title you know split across platforms and stuff wow they you know despite what do you want to call the number big or small or whatever EA made money appear out of nowhere

02:26:02.461 --> 02:26:03.301
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, good for them.

02:26:03.482 --> 02:26:04.402
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not deserving.

02:26:04.562 --> 02:26:11.566
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that they need that money because, once again, their complaint was, oh, well, those people that buy the game used.

02:26:11.706 --> 02:26:14.768
[SPEAKER_10]: The tax breaks they're getting from the government just aren't enough.

02:26:14.848 --> 02:26:16.408
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you read about that this week?

02:26:16.428 --> 02:26:17.289
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, I read about that.

02:26:17.789 --> 02:26:26.694
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and their excuse, well, those people that are buying used, we can't support the online if they're buying the game used because we don't see any of their revenue.

02:26:28.012 --> 02:26:37.243
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's a nice way to spin it except for the fact that the person that first bought that game brand new already paid you that money to keep up your network.

02:26:38.604 --> 02:26:39.646
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too damn bad.

02:26:40.406 --> 02:26:40.927
[SPEAKER_09]: Suck it up.

02:26:41.968 --> 02:26:42.609
[SPEAKER_09]: You're EA.

02:26:43.009 --> 02:26:43.850
[SPEAKER_09]: You can survive.

02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:46.501
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:27:09.978 --> 02:27:11.919
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, but this is a game.

02:27:12.739 --> 02:27:14.180
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a free-to-download game.

02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:17.461
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in beta right now, and it's a game called Oniken.

02:27:18.361 --> 02:27:25.223
[SPEAKER_10]: Oniken is, I guess, a tribute to challenging 8-bit action games from the NES.

02:27:26.364 --> 02:27:38.068
[SPEAKER_10]: They say that the game is actually NES hard, and there's a little clip here I'm going to play in studio, and I think DarkSakura would be into this because it looks a bit like the guy's weapon he's using is very Strider-esque.

02:27:39.813 --> 02:27:42.374
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, once again, this is not like a NES ROM.

02:27:42.654 --> 02:27:43.955
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, it does look like a Cypher.

02:27:44.876 --> 02:27:45.216
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't it?

02:27:45.776 --> 02:27:51.559
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually designed to be a game on the PC that is just NES tribute, NES style hard.

02:27:51.619 --> 02:27:54.821
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that means like, we're talking La Mulana or what.

02:27:55.221 --> 02:27:57.282
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Bionic Commando.

02:27:57.982 --> 02:27:59.043
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not to me.

02:27:59.623 --> 02:28:00.704
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, like the backgrounds.

02:28:01.164 --> 02:28:03.445
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, the artwork is very Bionic Commando.

02:28:03.465 --> 02:28:04.426
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about the gameplay.

02:28:04.446 --> 02:28:05.586
[SPEAKER_10]: No, nothing like it though. ...

02:28:08.968 --> 02:28:09.969
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks really fun though.

02:28:11.972 --> 02:28:13.454
[SPEAKER_10]: Fast forward to some of these other levels.

02:28:14.035 --> 02:28:18.881
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that almost looks like a rip of the Ninja Gaiden sprite from the original game.

02:28:18.921 --> 02:28:20.864
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they just switched it up a little bit.

02:28:20.944 --> 02:28:23.607
[SPEAKER_09]: Like even his stance and the way he moves and stuff like that.

02:28:23.848 --> 02:28:24.589
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit, huh?

02:28:25.029 --> 02:28:28.870
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently what's available right now to play, three missions in the game.

02:28:29.950 --> 02:28:33.571
[SPEAKER_10]: Oniken, again is the name of the game, O-N-I-K-E-N.

02:28:34.371 --> 02:28:37.032
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of good visuals and so forth.

02:28:37.092 --> 02:28:45.534
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to check it out for yourself, oniken.net, H-T-T-P, colon slash slash, www.oniken.net.

02:28:45.614 --> 02:28:48.075
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will go ahead and paste that in chat for the live listeners.

02:28:48.155 --> 02:28:50.356
[SPEAKER_10]: Those of you on the podcast, I hope you were writing quickly.

02:28:51.736 --> 02:28:55.959
[SPEAKER_10]: or maybe I can get DarkSakura to Tumblr at least the video there so you guys can check that out.

02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:57.520
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you link it?

02:28:57.641 --> 02:28:58.121
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there it is.

02:28:58.181 --> 02:28:58.401
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:28:58.541 --> 02:29:00.523
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll put it on the thing.

02:29:00.883 --> 02:29:01.183
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

02:29:02.344 --> 02:29:02.984
[SPEAKER_10]: That was kind of fun.

02:29:03.185 --> 02:29:03.905
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to check that out.

02:29:05.266 --> 02:29:06.087
[SPEAKER_07]: Big Brother Blade?

02:29:06.407 --> 02:29:07.568
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the fact that it's free.

02:29:07.588 --> 02:29:08.108
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Ogre Blade?

02:29:09.229 --> 02:29:09.549
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe?

02:29:10.330 --> 02:29:10.830
[SPEAKER_07]: Ogre Blade?

02:29:11.651 --> 02:29:12.972
[SPEAKER_10]: Free is my favorite word.

02:29:13.812 --> 02:29:14.413
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

02:29:15.694 --> 02:29:18.175
[SPEAKER_10]: How about we open up the phone line and take some of your calls right now?

02:29:18.195 --> 02:29:21.477
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Speaking of free, you can call us free on that line.

02:29:21.897 --> 02:29:24.418
[SPEAKER_10]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29:24.638 --> 02:29:31.782
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight or if you have something gaming related that we haven't quite got to yet, we will talk about that as well.

02:29:32.302 --> 02:29:37.005
[SPEAKER_10]: Meanwhile, we're going to fire up the Twitter and get to some of your tweets this week at twitter.com.

02:29:39.667 --> 02:29:40.747
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to the tweets real quick.

02:29:41.308 --> 02:29:42.729
[SPEAKER_10]: Jvmon sent us a tweet tonight.

02:29:43.129 --> 02:29:45.531
[SPEAKER_10]: When did WoW, Warcraft, get so fun?

02:29:45.972 --> 02:29:47.153
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't stop playing.

02:29:47.473 --> 02:29:48.154
[SPEAKER_10]: I blame you.

02:29:48.254 --> 02:29:48.954
[SPEAKER_10]: Hugs and kisses.

02:29:49.995 --> 02:29:50.896
[SPEAKER_07]: When Cataclysm hit.

02:29:51.716 --> 02:29:58.442
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so interesting because to a lot of the hardcore, so to speak, Cataclysm was not so well received.

02:29:58.942 --> 02:29:59.963
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very interesting.

02:30:00.263 --> 02:30:05.668
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the changing of the level 1 to 60 areas, though, is great for those that weren't quite yet into WoW.

02:30:06.337 --> 02:30:08.538
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think that was kind of cool, I guess.

02:30:10.018 --> 02:30:12.059
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, Cataclysm hasn't been all bad news.

02:30:12.119 --> 02:30:18.021
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just I think the early game is much more improved than the end game was, if that makes sense.

02:30:18.721 --> 02:30:20.562
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, we got calls coming in, so let's go to it.

02:30:20.602 --> 02:30:21.642
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:30:21.662 --> 02:30:22.062
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

02:30:22.683 --> 02:30:23.843
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one and only Ranma.

02:30:24.003 --> 02:30:24.423
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma.

02:30:24.443 --> 02:30:25.083
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

02:30:26.164 --> 02:30:29.045
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, last week's podcast.

02:30:29.065 --> 02:30:30.285
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's on my mind tonight.

02:30:30.745 --> 02:30:31.326
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is that?

02:30:31.406 --> 02:30:32.226
[SPEAKER_10]: It was long, wasn't it?

02:30:33.140 --> 02:30:41.899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, it was long, and that was the first time in history I've had to listen to it again just to absorb all that...

02:30:43.936 --> 02:30:45.236
[SPEAKER_04]: Big G Bullshit

02:31:14.321 --> 02:31:19.168
[SPEAKER_04]: I strongly believe that Square Enix didn't do anything wrong.

02:31:20.049 --> 02:31:24.376
[SPEAKER_04]: The big G is just butt hurt and they're blowing smoke up people's asses.

02:31:25.825 --> 02:31:26.285
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:31:26.646 --> 02:31:31.009
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think it was in bad form for Squeenix to spring that on people.

02:31:31.469 --> 02:31:36.653
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think GameStop had the right to know what was in that box and choose not to sell it.

02:31:37.074 --> 02:31:46.921
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I said, I don't want to repeat myself from last week, but as I said, the correct answer was what they finally did too late was just push the game back to Squeenix and refuse to sell it.

02:31:47.822 --> 02:31:50.044
[SPEAKER_10]: If they'd just done that to begin with, there wouldn't have been a problem.

02:31:50.748 --> 02:31:55.750
[SPEAKER_04]: To be perfectly honest, I do not believe the whole 48 hours thing.

02:31:56.031 --> 02:32:07.896
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, during my time working in these big chain companies, when companies like Square, Nintendo, and everybody else, when they're going to do something like that, they send a notice out.

02:32:08.497 --> 02:32:14.259
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually about two to three weeks prior, before do this.

02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:17.581
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I really believe that

02:32:18.763 --> 02:32:22.965
[SPEAKER_04]: The Big G knew about this, but they were just waiting what to do, what to do.

02:32:23.405 --> 02:32:33.051
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I feel that they decided, oh, let's wait about this time, pull the code out, and just start all it is.

02:32:33.491 --> 02:32:37.153
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of it could have been a publicity stunt, which I find hard to...

02:32:38.226 --> 02:32:42.507
[SPEAKER_04]: But from my retail experience, I don't believe that they just found out two days prior.

02:32:42.887 --> 02:32:44.308
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point.

02:32:44.328 --> 02:32:47.688
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't understand how any other chain had an issue with it.

02:32:47.808 --> 02:32:48.349
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?

02:32:48.369 --> 02:32:52.650
[SPEAKER_10]: It does seem like the memo went out to pull those codes really early on.

02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:54.110
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, I don't know.

02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:55.970
[SPEAKER_10]: But what do you think, though?

02:32:56.511 --> 02:32:58.811
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you buy Deus Ex on PC out of curiosity?

02:32:59.591 --> 02:32:59.851
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

02:33:00.912 --> 02:33:02.292
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let's assume you had.

02:33:02.852 --> 02:33:03.052
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

02:33:03.932 --> 02:33:06.073
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think you would have used that coupon for OnLive?

02:33:07.366 --> 02:33:10.527
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not, no.

02:33:10.608 --> 02:33:12.729
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that coupon's really that big a deal.

02:33:12.789 --> 02:33:21.092
[SPEAKER_10]: I think people are going to go use it to check out on live and go, ooh, that's kind of neat, and play it for five minutes and then be done with it.

02:33:21.112 --> 02:33:23.854
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like Portal or something.

02:33:24.174 --> 02:33:27.035
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not as rich as that kind of connection.

02:33:27.515 --> 02:33:31.898
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was just the whole thought that, oh my gosh, they're taking out a $50 coupon.

02:33:33.746 --> 02:33:35.207
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's another thing.

02:33:35.267 --> 02:33:36.947
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, Valve did the same thing.

02:33:37.087 --> 02:33:40.889
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the big G having an issue with it.

02:33:41.129 --> 02:33:45.271
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe the whole spin on how they had this agreement with Valve, you know.

02:33:46.311 --> 02:33:55.695
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to be perfectly honest, let's say Square Enix says, oh, because of this, we're no longer selling our products to you.

02:33:56.718 --> 02:34:02.581
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know since Square Enix is one of the big players out there, it would not surprise me if other manufacturers were like, you know?

02:34:02.861 --> 02:34:03.361
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a note.

02:34:04.042 --> 02:34:18.449
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's as easy as that because, you know, Evil G, or as I like to call him, the Evil Genius, the Evil Genius has a huge hold on, you know, the share of the games that they push through is gigantic.

02:34:19.009 --> 02:34:21.711
[SPEAKER_04]: True, but I prefer to call them Gazpacho Stop.

02:34:25.239 --> 02:34:27.321
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure we could sit here and think of names all day.

02:34:27.741 --> 02:34:27.981
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

02:34:50.399 --> 02:34:50.999
[SPEAKER_04]: of the price.

02:34:51.759 --> 02:34:54.840
[SPEAKER_04]: Wherever you bought it from, by law, they have to give you the difference.

02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:56.160
[SPEAKER_04]: State or federal?

02:34:56.340 --> 02:34:57.020
[SPEAKER_10]: State or federal?

02:34:58.200 --> 02:34:58.420
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:34:59.001 --> 02:35:00.281
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.

02:35:00.341 --> 02:35:03.321
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's a price drop within 30 days, they have to give you the difference.

02:35:03.341 --> 02:35:04.502
[SPEAKER_04]: State law or federal law?

02:35:04.762 --> 02:35:08.462
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't sound like a law at all.

02:35:08.522 --> 02:35:09.202
[SPEAKER_04]: It's consumer law.

02:35:09.242 --> 02:35:10.663
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the things I had to learn about.

02:35:10.703 --> 02:35:14.243
[SPEAKER_07]: But is that consumer law for New York or is it for federal?

02:35:14.843 --> 02:35:15.804
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be the deal, Rama.

02:35:15.844 --> 02:35:17.544
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be because I've never heard of that here either.

02:35:18.205 --> 02:35:20.668
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know it's New York State law.

02:35:20.989 --> 02:35:23.873
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, same thing in Jersey, Connecticut, and a bunch of other states.

02:35:24.113 --> 02:35:30.122
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would not surprise me if it's a federal law, but you know how some people do that whole federal law dance thing.

02:35:30.162 --> 02:35:33.447
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of those things we don't get out here on the West Coast, like hurricanes.

02:35:35.353 --> 02:35:36.794
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I slept through, by the way.

02:35:37.455 --> 02:35:38.356
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard a lot of people did.

02:35:38.416 --> 02:35:40.798
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mean to make light of a bad situation.

02:35:41.259 --> 02:35:44.542
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, people in Vermont did not fare as well as people in New York City, from what I understand.

02:35:45.342 --> 02:35:45.803
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

02:35:45.943 --> 02:35:46.624
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope everybody's alright.

02:35:46.644 --> 02:35:48.025
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we're going to let you go, Ranma.

02:35:48.665 --> 02:35:48.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

02:35:49.246 --> 02:35:49.646
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

02:35:50.527 --> 02:35:50.847
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

02:35:51.868 --> 02:35:52.129
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:35:52.829 --> 02:35:55.512
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to go into this aside real quick before we take another call.

02:35:55.532 --> 02:36:02.137
[SPEAKER_10]: We got more calls coming in, but I want to do this real quick because we were talking about scary games earlier, and several people in the chat room brought up Amnesia.

02:36:03.038 --> 02:36:03.999
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's the thing, though.

02:36:04.019 --> 02:36:08.803
[SPEAKER_10]: The story of the Dark Sakura was about 360 games, and Amnesia is a PC-only game.

02:36:08.883 --> 02:36:09.364
[SPEAKER_10]: However—

02:36:09.844 --> 02:36:10.404
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:36:33.290 --> 02:36:34.171
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never seen these.

02:36:34.211 --> 02:36:38.134
[SPEAKER_10]: This could be a horrible segment, but I want to try playing one of these on air here.

02:36:39.875 --> 02:36:40.735
[SPEAKER_10]: What is this called here?

02:36:41.356 --> 02:36:42.417
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want your stupid advertisement.

02:36:42.437 --> 02:36:43.317
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get through the advertisement.

02:36:43.637 --> 02:36:47.280
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Funny Freakouts Here to Amnesia.

02:36:48.641 --> 02:36:50.182
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get to this.

02:36:52.564 --> 02:36:53.224
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

02:36:53.324 --> 02:36:55.305
[SPEAKER_10]: A Funtage, I guess they're calling this.

02:36:55.366 --> 02:36:55.966
[SPEAKER_10]: He says a minute 33.

02:36:56.026 --> 02:36:56.867
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me start it there.

02:37:12.908 --> 02:37:15.810
[SPEAKER_00]: Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, no, good, good, good.

02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:16.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, shut up.

02:37:16.450 --> 02:37:22.212
[SPEAKER_02]: In there, in there, hide, in there, get in there, jump in, jump in, close the door, close, close both doors, both doors, both doors, stop, stop, close, close, close, close.

02:37:22.232 --> 02:37:22.632
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't take it.

02:37:22.652 --> 02:37:35.858
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't

02:37:36.405 --> 02:37:38.126
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, Jesus Christ!

02:37:38.266 --> 02:37:39.726
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Jesus Christ!

02:37:39.767 --> 02:37:40.467
[SPEAKER_00]: No!

02:37:40.507 --> 02:37:40.807
[SPEAKER_00]: No!

02:37:41.007 --> 02:37:41.527
[SPEAKER_00]: Run!

02:37:41.647 --> 02:37:42.048
[SPEAKER_00]: Run!

02:37:42.308 --> 02:37:42.728
[SPEAKER_00]: Run!

02:37:43.068 --> 02:37:43.388
[SPEAKER_00]: Run!

02:37:43.588 --> 02:37:45.089
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I go?

02:37:45.309 --> 02:37:45.969
[SPEAKER_00]: I hide in there!

02:37:46.209 --> 02:37:47.530
[SPEAKER_00]: I hide over here!

02:37:47.630 --> 02:37:48.590
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you!

02:37:49.651 --> 02:37:50.131
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus!

02:37:54.133 --> 02:37:55.213
[SPEAKER_08]: Run!

02:37:58.835 --> 02:38:03.377
[SPEAKER_10]: See, that's the problem, is that when you do 360-only games, you can't include amnesia.

02:38:04.537 --> 02:38:05.838
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to pay 20 bucks for that.

02:38:06.517 --> 02:38:07.277
[SPEAKER_10]: I have amnesia.

02:38:07.297 --> 02:38:12.540
[SPEAKER_10]: You should come over and we should make a reaction video to amnesia because we'll both scream like 12-year-old girls.

02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:12.880
[SPEAKER_10]: We will.

02:38:13.220 --> 02:38:15.961
[SPEAKER_07]: I want it, but I don't want to pay 20 bucks for it.

02:38:16.262 --> 02:38:16.682
[SPEAKER_10]: I have it.

02:38:16.822 --> 02:38:18.102
[SPEAKER_10]: You should come over one night.

02:38:19.103 --> 02:38:20.203
[SPEAKER_10]: We could do this on Halloween.

02:38:20.423 --> 02:38:21.264
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

02:38:22.404 --> 02:38:24.905
[SPEAKER_10]: Were we talking about this at breakfast or was it talking about with Salacious Pop?

02:38:24.985 --> 02:38:25.446
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting old.

02:38:25.486 --> 02:38:26.006
[SPEAKER_10]: I forget things.

02:38:26.206 --> 02:38:27.107
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about it this morning.

02:38:27.127 --> 02:38:31.354
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about it at breakfast because we were talking about Castlevania or something.

02:38:31.454 --> 02:38:33.457
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, no, we got to play something really scary.

02:38:33.497 --> 02:38:37.002
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to play Amnesia, which I have yet to... I bought it, but I haven't played it yet.

02:38:37.523 --> 02:38:39.806
[SPEAKER_10]: So you'd get some genuine reactions out of me.

02:38:40.106 --> 02:38:41.128
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll do that.

02:38:41.168 --> 02:38:41.669
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be down for that.

02:38:45.137 --> 02:38:47.699
[SPEAKER_10]: We might have to have an OLR Halloween special.

02:38:47.979 --> 02:38:50.821
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like Nickelodeon would do.

02:38:50.841 --> 02:38:53.362
[SPEAKER_10]: The Mark Summers Halloween mansion or whatever.

02:38:53.403 --> 02:38:57.925
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to do Amnesia Night with DarkSakura, Rob Roberts, and maybe Loki.

02:38:58.146 --> 02:38:58.426
[SPEAKER_07]: You hear?

02:38:59.547 --> 02:39:01.988
[SPEAKER_07]: You know when I scream to when my voice goes away?

02:39:02.008 --> 02:39:02.549
[SPEAKER_07]: Be quiet.

02:39:04.090 --> 02:39:04.450
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:39:05.711 --> 02:39:07.072
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to some more calls.

02:39:08.192 --> 02:39:10.754
[SPEAKER_10]: We've made these people wait through amnesia reaction videos.

02:39:10.774 --> 02:39:11.735
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:39:11.755 --> 02:39:12.035
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

02:39:14.025 --> 02:39:14.626
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up, guys?

02:39:14.666 --> 02:39:15.226
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Kaijudo.

02:39:15.246 --> 02:39:15.687
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

02:39:15.847 --> 02:39:16.388
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we can.

02:39:16.408 --> 02:39:17.048
[SPEAKER_05]: Hiya, Kaijudo.

02:39:17.068 --> 02:39:17.389
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

02:39:18.229 --> 02:39:18.770
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, not much.

02:39:18.810 --> 02:39:23.095
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to tell you, Rob, last week you spoke about the game Covert Action.

02:39:23.515 --> 02:39:25.197
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Sid Meier's Covert Action.

02:39:25.697 --> 02:39:26.678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was actually my favorite game.

02:39:26.698 --> 02:39:28.540
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the CIA calling you right now.

02:39:29.822 --> 02:39:29.982
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

02:39:30.002 --> 02:39:30.102
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

02:39:30.990 --> 02:39:31.811
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, we can hear you.

02:39:32.371 --> 02:39:38.677
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, anyway, that was a favorite game of mine too, and I found it about three years ago.

02:39:40.118 --> 02:39:48.765
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play it for free online on the PC, and also, you might like this, you'll be able to play it on your Nintendo DS if you have an R4 card.

02:39:49.486 --> 02:39:51.828
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually play it while I'm in the bathroom.

02:39:54.030 --> 02:39:55.731
[SPEAKER_10]: Doing some espionage of your own.

02:39:55.771 --> 02:39:57.753
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where I do my best work, man.

02:39:59.901 --> 02:40:02.301
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, if you have an R4 card, it's really simple.

02:40:02.321 --> 02:40:03.682
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure Loki can help you out.

02:40:03.802 --> 02:40:11.843
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the R4 card, you get the covert action ROM somewhere online where you can find it, and then there's like some type of application.

02:40:11.883 --> 02:40:15.684
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it, because I have a few of them on my R4, so I don't know which one it is.

02:40:15.724 --> 02:40:25.926
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the Apple II emulator that you can put on your DS with the R4 that gives you the covert action, or it might be one of the others, but it's real easy to find.

02:40:25.946 --> 02:40:26.486
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

02:40:27.947 --> 02:40:29.989
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have an R4 cartridge.

02:40:30.149 --> 02:40:31.330
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a spare R4.

02:40:31.350 --> 02:40:33.251
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Loki will let me borrow one of his.

02:40:34.552 --> 02:40:35.112
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

02:40:35.232 --> 02:40:36.093
[SPEAKER_10]: I loved Covert Action.

02:40:36.133 --> 02:40:37.514
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what it is about that game either.

02:40:37.874 --> 02:40:40.116
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, Sid Meier, he's the man.

02:40:40.576 --> 02:40:42.258
[SPEAKER_05]: He's made so many good games.

02:40:42.978 --> 02:40:44.579
[SPEAKER_05]: And he doesn't like that game for some reason.

02:40:44.799 --> 02:40:49.020
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you mentioned yesterday people said that it was like too many games in one.

02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:54.883
[SPEAKER_10]: Sid Meier, that was actually Sid Meier said that they tried to do too much in one game.

02:40:54.943 --> 02:41:00.004
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like four separate games that none of them were really fully realized.

02:41:00.585 --> 02:41:05.366
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be fair, the driving game was always kind of dumb anyway.

02:41:05.767 --> 02:41:09.368
[SPEAKER_10]: The best part was the actual one where you broke in to the facilities.

02:41:09.388 --> 02:41:09.468
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:41:09.628 --> 02:41:10.729
[SPEAKER_10]: Cryptogram, Switchboard Puzzles, Logic Puzzles

02:41:39.782 --> 02:41:40.443
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:41:55.117 --> 02:41:56.317
[SPEAKER_05]: to play that version of the game.

02:41:56.617 --> 02:41:59.558
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, Actdeft in chat says Piracy Lounge Radio.

02:41:59.698 --> 02:42:02.439
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I legit own this game back in the day.

02:42:02.499 --> 02:42:03.419
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

02:42:03.659 --> 02:42:07.860
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to let them know, the game is officially free online.

02:42:07.900 --> 02:42:09.081
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like you're pirating the game.

02:42:09.881 --> 02:42:12.222
[SPEAKER_05]: There's somewhere where they provide it to you for free.

02:42:12.662 --> 02:42:13.302
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, the...

02:42:14.557 --> 02:42:15.637
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:42:32.771 --> 02:42:34.092
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, this game looks awesome.

02:42:35.153 --> 02:42:36.313
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's Cthulhu Saves the World.

02:42:36.714 --> 02:42:37.454
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've never played it.

02:42:37.534 --> 02:42:39.716
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, those are on Xbox Live Indie Marketplace.

02:42:39.776 --> 02:42:42.417
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to hang up and let you get to your next call.

02:42:42.618 --> 02:42:44.139
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for being courteous, Kaijudo.

02:42:44.159 --> 02:42:44.859
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very nice of you.

02:42:45.359 --> 02:42:45.860
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

02:42:46.280 --> 02:42:49.542
[SPEAKER_07]: Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death 7 are three bucks.

02:42:51.263 --> 02:42:52.864
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say there was a story one week.

02:42:53.104 --> 02:42:53.885
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember how long ago.

02:42:54.225 --> 02:43:01.290
[SPEAKER_10]: They sold more on Steam of those games in one weekend than they did the entire time the game was on Xbox Live Indie Arcade.

02:43:01.790 --> 02:43:02.031
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

02:43:02.431 --> 02:43:03.793
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, the games are like really cheap.

02:43:03.813 --> 02:43:04.234
[SPEAKER_10]: They're fun.

02:43:04.595 --> 02:43:04.975
[SPEAKER_10]: They're cute.

02:43:04.995 --> 02:43:09.302
[SPEAKER_10]: They're definitely a throwback to the old school Super Nintendo RPGs with humor.

02:43:10.023 --> 02:43:12.267
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the Cthulhu one because Cthulhu is cute.

02:43:13.569 --> 02:43:14.931
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever see Hello Cthulhu?

02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:17.250
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I have.

02:43:17.290 --> 02:43:18.771
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the Hello Kitty doll, but it's Cthulhu.

02:43:18.951 --> 02:43:23.192
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's actually Cthulhu ending up in the Sanrio universe and corrupting Hello Kitty.

02:43:24.393 --> 02:43:24.533
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

02:43:24.553 --> 02:43:26.694
[SPEAKER_07]: The person only did like a few of them, but they're super funny.

02:43:26.774 --> 02:43:31.015
[SPEAKER_10]: Would that look like the Hello Kitty in the Ursula outfit doll that I bought Salacious Pop?

02:43:31.575 --> 02:43:33.416
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's just a super cute Cthulhu.

02:43:34.396 --> 02:43:38.458
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a little SD Sanrio style Cthulhu hanging out with a gothed out kitty.

02:43:38.638 --> 02:43:41.919
[SPEAKER_10]: I still really want you to have your World of Warcraft character named Ursulol.

02:43:42.532 --> 02:43:45.293
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe I'll remake Fatty Cakes into Ursula.

02:43:45.333 --> 02:43:46.733
[SPEAKER_07]: But Fatty Cakes is a good name, too.

02:43:47.534 --> 02:43:48.134
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make Ursula.

02:43:48.174 --> 02:43:49.434
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go to another call.

02:43:49.494 --> 02:43:50.354
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

02:43:50.374 --> 02:43:50.715
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

02:43:51.355 --> 02:43:52.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku here.

02:43:52.255 --> 02:43:52.715
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, buddy.

02:43:52.735 --> 02:43:53.275
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing?

02:43:54.056 --> 02:43:55.376
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good, as usual.

02:43:56.116 --> 02:43:56.436
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, good.

02:43:56.456 --> 02:43:56.756
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

02:43:58.457 --> 02:43:58.537
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

02:43:59.198 --> 02:44:13.404
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what I wanted to bring up was the fact that Activision is kind of like trying to get the folks currently on the fence like myself from Modern Warfare 3 on the PC by just like re-adding things that they took out.

02:44:13.645 --> 02:44:17.986
[SPEAKER_02]: Case in point, LAN support, in addition to adding dedicated servers.

02:44:18.026 --> 02:44:23.149
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I don't know, on one hand they're trying to make a man's brand, on the other it's

02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:26.862
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to believe it has to be a bait and switch.

02:44:27.122 --> 02:44:31.326
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting, because I remember hearing that they took it out, but I did not hear about them putting it back in.

02:44:31.386 --> 02:44:33.228
[SPEAKER_02]: That was for Modern Warfare 2.

02:44:33.828 --> 02:44:34.269
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

02:44:35.370 --> 02:44:39.673
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so Modern Warfare 3 will actually have land support.

02:44:39.974 --> 02:44:49.322
[SPEAKER_10]: We know Blizzard is a huge part of Activision, obviously, and they've come under fire lately because StarCraft 2 does not have the land, and Diablo 3 is not going to have it either.

02:44:50.089 --> 02:44:53.171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're all going to be online for better or for worse.

02:44:53.612 --> 02:44:57.295
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to say it, but I sort of support it with Diablo 3.

02:44:57.575 --> 02:44:57.895
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:44:58.175 --> 02:44:58.676
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

02:44:59.256 --> 02:45:03.019
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing with Diablo 3 is that, let's face it, Diablo 2 was hacked to hell and back.

02:45:03.660 --> 02:45:06.022
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't play that game online with strangers.

02:45:06.122 --> 02:45:06.862
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so broken.

02:45:07.163 --> 02:45:09.004
[SPEAKER_10]: You can really only play with people you trust.

02:45:09.384 --> 02:45:15.609
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if they had kept a LAN campaign separate from an online campaign, they could have done it.

02:45:16.010 --> 02:45:18.672
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of disappointing, but there's always Torchlight 2.

02:45:20.458 --> 02:45:21.319
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that does help.

02:45:21.859 --> 02:45:25.902
[SPEAKER_10]: The $20 price tag that was confirmed this week helps too.

02:45:27.203 --> 02:45:46.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I guess I could I'll probably give them the benefit of the doubt, but seeing this Activision and the fact that they reneged on it back in Modern Warfare 2 when they promised that they were going to have dedicated servers and so forth, only to find out a few weeks before launch that it was quite the opposite.

02:45:47.397 --> 02:45:48.978
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to get fooled again.

02:45:51.144 --> 02:45:55.028
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think of the whole Call of Duty Expo that they did, the Call of Duty XP or whatever?

02:45:55.108 --> 02:46:01.014
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard bits and pieces, like people actually doing paintball matches to some of the maps in there.

02:46:01.955 --> 02:46:08.442
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like, I guess they're trying to hype it up to the point where, you know, it's all marketing at this point.

02:46:08.722 --> 02:46:08.903
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

02:46:09.443 --> 02:46:28.958
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the idea is that Call of Duty is for, you know, quote-unquote kind of like the douchebags game of choice in that regard, whereas Battlefield 3 is mostly for the hardcore nerd gamer that plays these types of FPSs like Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.

02:46:28.998 --> 02:46:34.261
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the type of demographic I see EA targeting, you know, with BF3.

02:46:35.382 --> 02:46:38.425
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Call of Duty is kind of like the dumbed-down, basic...

02:46:40.219 --> 02:46:44.127
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the one they're trying to get everyone on board with.

02:46:45.029 --> 02:46:46.391
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a frat boy type game.

02:46:48.154 --> 02:46:53.558
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm generalizing, and you can sue me if you want, but I'm just... No, it's fine.

02:46:54.018 --> 02:46:58.221
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so uneducated on all those games, and it's not that I dislike them.

02:46:58.241 --> 02:47:00.923
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just not my thing, and I suck at them.

02:47:00.943 --> 02:47:01.803
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so terrible at them.

02:47:02.083 --> 02:47:03.304
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like some people in DDR.

02:47:03.344 --> 02:47:07.547
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people think DDR is just... What the hell is that music that's coming out of that machine?

02:47:07.587 --> 02:47:08.668
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and not everybody gets it.

02:47:08.688 --> 02:47:09.388
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

02:47:09.408 --> 02:47:10.069
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, the...

02:47:10.789 --> 02:47:20.999
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what Activision is banking on is the mere fact that they can sell a shitload of copies of that game, of Modern Warfare, without having to change a lot.

02:47:21.980 --> 02:47:29.008
[SPEAKER_02]: And hoping that as long as you hype it up to the point where they kind of need to have it, are also going to be the...

02:47:31.242 --> 02:47:34.845
[SPEAKER_02]: The Unluckiest Kid in the Block without their copy of Call of Duty.

02:47:35.545 --> 02:47:48.115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like they're trying to create a mindset where you have to one-up your friend or your neighbors and covet that copy of Call of Duty that he has.

02:47:49.656 --> 02:47:56.081
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Battlefield 3, on the other hand, is going for more detail, more replay, more

02:47:57.335 --> 02:48:01.297
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say a lot more features than what Activision is offering.

02:48:01.437 --> 02:48:05.360
[SPEAKER_02]: It's aiming towards being a simulator.

02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:06.680
[SPEAKER_02]: A military simulator.

02:48:07.241 --> 02:48:08.681
[SPEAKER_10]: Are most people just going to get both?

02:48:09.662 --> 02:48:10.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right.

02:48:10.282 --> 02:48:11.203
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get both.

02:48:11.283 --> 02:48:19.447
[SPEAKER_02]: But I could see a lot of those uneducated regular token gamers are going to just get Modern Warfare 3.

02:48:20.648 --> 02:48:22.469
[SPEAKER_02]: The really hardcore ones, they're going to get both.

02:48:22.989 --> 02:48:25.031
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to balance time in between the two.

02:48:25.371 --> 02:48:25.551
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

02:48:27.132 --> 02:48:30.677
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like there's so much I want to play this holiday season.

02:48:30.777 --> 02:48:32.499
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, isn't that the case every holiday?

02:48:32.859 --> 02:48:39.927
[SPEAKER_10]: Somehow I will have to juggle my time between Skyrim, Diablo 3, Torchlight 2, and God knows what else I'm forgetting.

02:48:40.208 --> 02:48:41.389
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario Kart on the 3DS.

02:48:41.950 --> 02:48:44.393
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought Diablo 3 wasn't coming out this year.

02:48:44.653 --> 02:48:45.213
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it will.

02:48:46.014 --> 02:48:51.637
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't said one way or the other, but the friends and family beta is going on right now, which means the public beta is probably next month.

02:48:52.137 --> 02:48:55.359
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're going to announce at BlizzCon that it's coming out within the next month.

02:48:56.100 --> 02:48:58.721
[SPEAKER_10]: Why wouldn't they try to make end of year and have a huge thing?

02:48:58.741 --> 02:49:01.382
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Blizzard hasn't released anything else this year.

02:49:01.843 --> 02:49:05.004
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't release Diablo, they've released nothing.

02:49:05.044 --> 02:49:10.127
[SPEAKER_02]: And they still have to get the expansion pack for StarCraft 2, which is probably next year anyways.

02:49:10.307 --> 02:49:12.009
[SPEAKER_10]: Diablo 3 and an expansion and two WoW expansions.

02:49:29.540 --> 02:49:29.980
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:31.881
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes sense.

02:49:32.061 --> 02:49:35.862
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty much all of them are going to be on PC unless they do second-hand ports.

02:49:36.723 --> 02:49:39.023
[SPEAKER_10]: I guarantee Diablo 3 will end up on consoles.

02:49:39.243 --> 02:49:41.104
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just not going to be the same time as PC.

02:49:42.244 --> 02:49:46.726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and this is why you always want to, with Blizzard, it's always PC or nothing.

02:49:47.186 --> 02:49:49.967
[SPEAKER_10]: People forget Diablo was on the PlayStation.

02:49:50.447 --> 02:49:51.348
[SPEAKER_10]: StarCraft was on the 64.

02:49:51.408 --> 02:49:54.789
[SPEAKER_10]: Some things are better left forgotten.

02:49:55.249 --> 02:49:55.389
Yeah.

02:49:55.973 --> 02:50:02.179
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some things are better left forgotten than Blizzard's half-assed ports of their properties back in the day.

02:50:02.739 --> 02:50:04.381
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Warcraft comes to mind.

02:50:05.061 --> 02:50:09.825
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been 15 years since Diablo on the PlayStation 1, so it's worth a try.

02:50:10.446 --> 02:50:12.988
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed it on my PC.

02:50:13.108 --> 02:50:13.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough said.

02:50:13.829 --> 02:50:16.931
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show and have fun.

02:50:17.711 --> 02:50:18.412
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, take care, buddy.

02:50:19.012 --> 02:50:19.532
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

02:50:19.992 --> 02:50:21.813
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he's gonna be broke this holiday season, too.

02:50:21.833 --> 02:50:23.754
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot to ask him how much money he plans to spend.

02:50:24.355 --> 02:50:26.016
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, sadly, that's gonna do it for the Skyplane.

02:50:26.036 --> 02:50:28.357
[SPEAKER_07]: I want someone with money to get me a Moonkin Hashling.

02:50:30.058 --> 02:50:30.818
[SPEAKER_10]: They're what, ten bucks?

02:50:30.978 --> 02:50:31.278
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:50:31.599 --> 02:50:32.259
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not too bad.

02:50:32.779 --> 02:50:34.420
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's virtual pets.

02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:35.060
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:37.202
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I said I want someone else to do it.

02:50:37.222 --> 02:50:39.443
[SPEAKER_10]: How about I donate ten dollars to a charity in your honor?

02:50:39.463 --> 02:50:39.803
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh.

02:50:41.098 --> 02:50:41.358
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:50:41.478 --> 02:50:41.778
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:50:41.798 --> 02:50:42.599
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, what the hell?

02:50:43.359 --> 02:50:44.219
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, moving on.

02:50:44.519 --> 02:50:46.480
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to finish up the tweets so we can finish up the show tonight.

02:50:47.140 --> 02:50:48.841
[SPEAKER_10]: We just had a handful of other tweets.

02:50:49.501 --> 02:50:53.743
[SPEAKER_10]: An interesting one from Tiger Claw tweeting OLR at twitter.com slash OLR.

02:50:54.103 --> 02:50:58.845
[SPEAKER_10]: Study suggests virtual goods purchasing differs by ethnicity.

02:50:59.145 --> 02:51:03.127
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh boy, this could be a... All right, let's see what this is all about.

02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:11.762
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an article from Gamasutra that we were linked to on Twitter by user TigerClaw305.

02:51:12.602 --> 02:51:20.105
[SPEAKER_10]: New study published Friday by mobile game community MocoSpace suggests that virtual goods purchasing behavior may be affected by ethnicity.

02:51:20.805 --> 02:51:29.247
[SPEAKER_10]: A survey of anonymous data from 40,000 mobile social gamers revealed that both Caucasians and African Americans over-indexed on virtual goods spendings.

02:51:29.667 --> 02:51:38.249
[SPEAKER_10]: Caucasians in particular were responsible for 26% of virtual goods purchases made during the study period, despite representing only 18% of those studied.

02:51:38.790 --> 02:51:41.150
[SPEAKER_10]: African Americans made up 36% of the respondents and made 38% of the purchases.

02:51:44.591 --> 02:51:51.934
[SPEAKER_10]: Those calling those Hispanic under-indexed despite compromising 31% of the sample pool, they made only 21% of the purchases.

02:51:52.474 --> 02:51:53.634
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, what does this all mean?

02:51:54.054 --> 02:51:55.275
[SPEAKER_10]: Numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers.

02:51:55.315 --> 02:51:55.895
[SPEAKER_10]: What does this mean?

02:51:56.475 --> 02:52:04.378
[SPEAKER_10]: According to MocoSpace CEO Justin Siegel, the rapid growth of virtual goods industry means that it, quote, makes sense to really start segmenting it.

02:52:04.798 --> 02:52:06.819
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not really understanding, like, how, but whatever.

02:52:29.963 --> 02:52:32.225
[SPEAKER_10]: People get paid to break that data down, just so you know.

02:52:32.365 --> 02:52:33.545
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody got paid to do that study.

02:52:35.487 --> 02:52:37.548
[SPEAKER_10]: Last tweet to us tonight from WatchDragon.

02:52:38.229 --> 02:52:40.270
[SPEAKER_10]: Beat Space Marine on hard.

02:52:40.330 --> 02:52:41.090
[SPEAKER_10]: What is Space Marine?

02:52:41.110 --> 02:52:41.771
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that just Halo?

02:52:42.792 --> 02:52:45.213
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's Warhammer 4 UK Space Marine.

02:52:45.433 --> 02:52:47.575
[SPEAKER_10]: Aha, that would explain the rest of this tweet.

02:52:47.995 --> 02:52:49.796
[SPEAKER_10]: I play the tabletop Warhammer.

02:52:49.936 --> 02:52:51.397
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true to the story and fluff.

02:52:52.818 --> 02:52:53.238
[SPEAKER_10]: And fluff.

02:52:54.920 --> 02:52:55.360
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

02:52:56.721 --> 02:52:59.143
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for educating me, Loki, because I did not pick that up.

02:52:59.843 --> 02:53:01.524
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not play Warhammer Tabletop.

02:53:01.564 --> 02:53:04.666
[SPEAKER_10]: The only Warhammer I've ever played was that MMO they put out a couple years ago.

02:53:05.147 --> 02:53:06.748
[SPEAKER_10]: You played Warhammer Tabletop, didn't you, DarkSakura?

02:53:06.788 --> 02:53:07.348
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell no.

02:53:07.608 --> 02:53:08.649
[SPEAKER_07]: I dated someone who did.

02:53:09.450 --> 02:53:15.014
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's... So sick of those stupid little... Oh, you had figurine trauma in that relationship.

02:53:15.254 --> 02:53:20.497
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, because... I tried playing Warhammer 40k Space Marine.

02:53:20.837 --> 02:53:25.080
[SPEAKER_09]: Warhammer 40k Space Marine was more of the larger scale... Well...

02:53:26.221 --> 02:53:31.849
[SPEAKER_09]: Larger scale battles, smaller scale figurines, the actual Space Marines are 6mm tall figurines.

02:53:32.510 --> 02:53:33.451
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not paint those.

02:53:34.012 --> 02:53:36.936
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried painting them, I'm like, fuck that, it's too damn small.

02:53:38.647 --> 02:53:39.007
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

02:53:39.167 --> 02:53:40.248
[SPEAKER_09]: And I threw it all away.

02:53:40.628 --> 02:53:42.749
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm like, I don't get this game.

02:53:42.769 --> 02:53:45.030
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played Dungeons and Dragons in like four years.

02:53:45.250 --> 02:53:46.191
[SPEAKER_10]: I should play sometime.

02:53:46.331 --> 02:53:46.631
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:53:46.711 --> 02:53:48.311
[SPEAKER_10]: God, I sound like a total nerd.

02:53:48.351 --> 02:53:49.252
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I didn't throw it away.

02:53:49.592 --> 02:53:51.453
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I might have it in a box somewhere.

02:53:52.553 --> 02:53:52.894
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

02:53:53.514 --> 02:53:54.974
[SPEAKER_10]: That does it for Twitter topics tonight.

02:53:55.054 --> 02:53:55.875
[SPEAKER_10]: Tweet us for next week.

02:53:55.915 --> 02:53:57.656
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

02:53:57.996 --> 02:54:00.337
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to Loki and see if he has any last minute stories.

02:54:01.918 --> 02:54:06.181
[SPEAKER_09]: Just real quick, rookies won't appear in NBA 2K12 until lockout's over.

02:54:08.362 --> 02:54:10.804
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be an update or something like that for free.

02:54:10.884 --> 02:54:12.124
[SPEAKER_10]: Lockouts are ruining everything.

02:54:12.305 --> 02:54:14.846
[SPEAKER_09]: Once that happens, you won't be able to play as the rookies.

02:54:18.129 --> 02:54:24.115
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there's a mysterious move game in development from the people that did, uh, Linger in Shadows.

02:54:24.135 --> 02:54:32.584
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that really weird dog flying thing with the basset hound and the shadow creature that looked like the squid from the Matrix or whatever?

02:54:32.604 --> 02:54:34.786
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I don't remember that and it's probably for the best.

02:54:35.512 --> 02:54:37.474
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:54:58.460 --> 02:55:21.342
[SPEAKER_09]: they could very well be like trying to put some sort of touch sensitive glove or something in the play because almost like all this stuff is just focusing on the textures of different things and obviously with the movie you're not going to be able to feel any of that so I don't know but right now weird video that's online so you can check it out and that's pretty much it

02:55:24.565 --> 02:55:28.649
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:55:28.969 --> 02:55:30.590
[SPEAKER_10]: So, DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

02:55:30.670 --> 02:55:31.591
[SPEAKER_10]: Your final thought tonight.

02:55:32.412 --> 02:55:32.812
[SPEAKER_10]: Duffy.

02:55:34.494 --> 02:55:36.615
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought tonight is tacos!

02:55:37.056 --> 02:55:37.316
[SPEAKER_10]: Again.

02:55:38.177 --> 02:55:40.118
[SPEAKER_10]: And bacon cupcakes, causing sugar headaches.

02:55:41.399 --> 02:55:43.321
[SPEAKER_10]: Those cupcakes, single-handedly, are going to make me diabetic.

02:55:43.361 --> 02:55:44.602
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a sugar headache right now.

02:55:44.722 --> 02:55:45.123
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

02:55:45.143 --> 02:55:47.465
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I ran to get water during one of the reports.

02:55:47.925 --> 02:55:48.365
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy.

02:55:48.886 --> 02:55:51.228
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:55:51.656 --> 02:55:56.918
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I made a flamethrower in Grand Theft Auto and no one else has.

02:55:57.778 --> 02:55:58.998
[SPEAKER_10]: And happy birthday once again.

02:55:59.158 --> 02:55:59.458
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

02:56:00.018 --> 02:56:01.399
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope you had a good one.

02:56:02.519 --> 02:56:03.720
