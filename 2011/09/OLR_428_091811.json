{"text": " Today, September 18th, 2011, Nintendo reveals the future of the 3DS and its pink. The PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch, and Sony adds a controversial new section to the PSN terms of service. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio. My name is Rob Roberts and joining you live here on this September 18th, 2011 for episode number 428 with my co-hosts, first off, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. We're also the show where every gamer has access to chicken. You can ask him if you want. I see. Yes. Dark Sakura's eating chicken. Tech master Loki is in the house over here as well and he's eating chicken. Yeah. And I am chickenless. But I do have- You can have some chicken. I do. No, it's okay. I actually don't really want chicken. I have a pumpkin spice frappuccino. So I'm good. I had a pumpkin spice latte. I had one of those brunches that was so big, like I'm still full. So I'm just like, I'm not even hungry. It's weird. I can't explain it. Okay. Anyhow. By the way, I'm still laughing my ass off over that Cracked article. Which was, what is this article you were reading about? It was one of those little photo shop things where they do rejected book covers and one of them was, it's okay to be a douchebag by Ayn Rand. You know what's interesting about that website is they have really made, you know, I'm not knocking it. This is just what I've noticed about them. An observation, if you will, they really seem to have made a name for themselves. I always thought, wasn't Cracked like a magazine, like the answer to Mad Magazine like 20 years ago? I think so. It was Mad Magazine Lite. Does that still exist? Mad Magazine. I don't even know. But now what I notice is that Cracked is on like dig in those websites all the time because it's like they specialize in top 10 lists or something like that. I think it's awesome. That's all they do is like lists. I'm going to do one for them. Do they take user submitted articles? They, well they do, but they also, the better, like the better that they are, like they'll start paying you for them or something. There you go. Okay, cool. New industry for you. Hey, I want you to join our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com. We do tape our show live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. Although to be fair, Bobby had the night off tonight, but nevermind if you're listening on the podcast and you've never heard a live show before, he'll be back next week. So again, if you are listening to us live at All Games Radio though, join us in the chat room. Again, that's chat.orangelaungeradio.com where we do often read comments from chat tonight, which actually I got to admit, chats a little more dead than I usually see it. And I don't know if that's just, we didn't have a lead in tonight cause Bobby was off or is it the Emmys? Like is everybody off watching the Emmys? Like I know that's our competition. We are always up against some stupid award show. Like Sunday night is like the night to have an award show in Hollywood and et cetera. And tonight it's the Emmys. The shmemmys. I don't know the Emmys or whatever. I barely watch any TV. I can't wait till it's over so I can see Kathy Griffin's roast of the Emmys. Is that a thing she does now? She's doing something now where she like bashes the Emmys when it's over. Didn't she get all that hate mail one year cause she said something at the Emmys? She said, Jesus has nothing to do with me winning this award. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh boy. All right. Crazy lady. Uh, anyhow. Uh, also speaking of Emmys, actually Emmys kind of had me thinking about like video game television today and kind of like how, you know, I don't think we'll ever see a video game show nominated for an Emmy, although I'm sure there's some type of technical award or something. Some has won, but what part of the shmemmys, what is it about video game TV? Like why hasn't there really been a lot of good video game TV? And I know, I know some folks out there are fans of X play and some folks might be fans of attack of the show, although I don't know. I don't even know if attack of the show is really like a gaming show anymore, more than it is just like a testosterone filled young guys kind of show. I don't know. Like the last video game show I remember myself getting really excited about was Nick arcade. Like that was an awesome or star K do you want to go like way back back in the eighties like the video game game shows. So I don't know. Are there any video game TV shows you guys have ever been into or are into? I was, um, I watched that one and I can never remember the name of it where, um, they would send the team through this like labyrinth with, uh, these Velcro vests and they would attach the prizes to their vest. I vaguely remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it was on Saturday morning after my cartoons. So I would watch it all the time and I was like, you can't stick a turbo graphics to your front, put it on your back. They were empty boxes. Probably it was just props or something like that, but I needed to grab games and stuff and it was pretty cool. Yeah. I know what you're talking about. I can't remember the name of it was, um, that was like something like labyrinth or something. But no, it wasn't that it was, it had this guy. I'm sure somebody in chat was probably JD Ross. He's in every goddamn eighties game show. Do you know what he's done now? Thank you. Wikipedia. Do you know what he does now? The big show that he's a producer, right? Yeah, he's a producer, but there's a really big show on TV that he, you can thank him for. The biggest loser is his thing. Well, how appropriate for him. There was another show that was on to that he will always be fun house to me. I'm sorry. Okay. That's what it was fun. No way. It wasn't fun. The fun house was like the double dare turned up to 11. Um, but it was also, um, well you remember that, that show, what was it? The quest of the kingdom or something that, but that's not one of the thing of, there's another guy who had Brown hair, he'd always wear like a member's only jacket. This was the eighties. Is that John Davidson? Wasn't he on Hollywood squares? He sat in a chair that looked a lot like captain Kirk's chair. And I remember the show very much because they did a big special on the Neo Geo and about taking the cards and switching them out, you know, putting them in the machine, saving your game and coming home and playing it at home. And I, for the life of me, I cannot remember what the name of the show was. Let me ask this question while you guys try to think of the show or while the chatters that shout it out. Why, why is it that video game, video power, why is it that video game television hasn't really seemed to work? And I mean, there, there has been a few exceptions, like, you know, I know some of you guys dig X play. I know there's that show on spike TV that gets to break a lot of exclusives. The one that Jeff Keeley does, you know, there's been a few things here and there, but like, you know, G4 TV was supposed to be all about video games, but you know, it didn't work cause it went like this whole different direction where it's aimed towards young guys. Like is it just that, you know, we're too busy wanting to play video games, then watch people talk about it on the TV? Like why doesn't it work? It's because it's too niche of an audience and it's hard for them to convince people to sponsor the shows or put advertisements on the show because they're not getting as many views as normal, especially in nowadays, you know, it's kind of irrelevant to have a video game show unless you can lock in those kinds of exclusive interviews and sneak peeks and stuff like that, that you can't do on the internet because you know, internet's faster than TV or print media and that's just the way it is unless they're breaking news. That's kind of the way it goes. I'm positive one of them was video power. You know, we have a story coming up later tonight. I'm not going to totally get into it now, but you know, one of the big consoles is launching a TV related thing and we'll talk more about that later. But that does kind of seem to be like the future, especially when we talk a lot about like a video on demand and how huge Netflix and Hulu and all that stuff has been on PlayStation as well as Xbox. And do you think it's possible that as these consoles become more like entertainment devices, like almost for some people may be replacing cable someday. I don't know. Do you think we'll see more gaming related content on those consoles? Well, yeah, if it's on a console, I can imagine that they're going to try to put some gaming related content on there. They'll probably feel like infomercials more than anything like kind of like the, you know, majors minute on Xbox 360 is as nice as that is. Let's let's be real. It's just a product awareness thing for for Microsoft, right? Yeah. Well, I'm trying to find there is an article I saw talking about some new video game shows coming and it was by the guy that did like The Room or something like that. Not Silent Hill The Room, but like actually like the horrible cult movie The Room. Yes. The horrible cult movie. It's actually him. Yeah. And it looks so fucking terrible. I can't remember what the parody or it's a joke or something. I don't think it is all to take too seriously. I am your something. Interesting. I don't remember what it was. It's just retarded for the record. The show, both shows I was thinking of is actually the same show, but different seasons of it. It's video power, video power because it started off as like a tip show and then it became a game show. Oh yeah. I remember that one. Yeah. It was like game show. It had tips. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But no, it started off I think it's just tips. Interesting. And it was like 1990, 1991. I thought it was earlier than that. Yeah. It was like in the mid 80s. I'm going to double check. I don't know. Um, let's see. What else do I want to say? Oh, Oh, I know what I wanted to say about like television on the consoles and so forth. Like this, this is still a sore point for me to this day. 1992. Wow. Was it really? In two different formats from 1990 through 92. Gosh. I'm, I'm with Dan in the other room. I thought it was way earlier than that. Of course Wikipedia is always right 100% of the time, right? Directed by Stevie Piskoski. I'm going to double check IMDB. Um, let me, let me hit on this. I want to mention this and that is, you know, one thing that I think would have made an awesome television show would have been, um, the one versus 100 on Xbox 360. Like I really feel like Microsoft was sitting on a gold mine with that and they let it go. And I don't know if it's because of licensing reasons or what have you, but man, I know so many people that were so into that. It's really weird that they let it go. And it really made me think like, why hasn't like game show network tried to pick up like an actual game show that runs through consoles or something? I don't know. All right. I found it. It's called the Tommy Wee Show and it's featuring Tommy Wiseau. And basically it's supposed to be this weird, I don't know, uh, they're saying it's, it's going to be, um, presented by Makima. And it's basically, it follows him as he repeatedly gets abducted by different races of mysterious aliens transported to distant planets where he's forced to test popular video games. So it's, it's a terrible idea ripped off of Mystery Science Theater 3000 with this guy that looks like he's the undertaker or something like that. It's just ridiculous. I don't know. Hey, guess what? No one care. All right. So the screen, like where the screen freezes, he looks like he's about to throw up or you know, fall asleep or something or both. It's wherever this, that guy is very strange. Anyhow. Um, yeah, so I'm, I'm a little upset that, that Microsoft kind of let that thing go, but I guess it wasn't very profitable for them or whatever. They're probably losing money on it, but I think they should still revisit it at some point. Oh, one other, uh, we'll get into our gaming weeks here in a minute, but one other like game slash TV related thing that I can think of that I know is coming soon is the whole, um, uh, sci-fi TV show that's supposed to be like tied into an MMO. Like I can't, I just, it popped in my head. It was something I think they had talked about at E3. Do you remember anything about that? Loki? It was like some time. I know what you're talking about, but I don't know what the hell it's called. And nor do I care. It's a sci-fi show. I mean, come on. Um, one game series that I actually watched while there was a bunch of old ones, you know, back in the eighties and nineties and stuff, game shows, you know, for sure. Um, but I watched, um, well X play when, um, or extended play back when it was, you know, tech TV, I used to watch that all the time. Um, even next play, I used to watch it when it was G4 tech TV. Um, and then of course, Starrcade, which was, you know, rerun like hell on that network before it started sucking, um, and they got rid of it. Um, what was the other one that was, yeah, portal was kind of lame. They had that on there. Um, I just watched all the online reviews now. It's called Dave, where you go running around in MMOs and they do mock you. Wasn't that the one that Wil Wheaton hosted or was that? No. Oh. I just really watch YouTube like, like the Angry Video Game Nerd and you know, uh, crap. What's that other one that you watch? Classic Game Room. Classic Game Room is pretty cool. Maybe that's it. Everybody's turning to YouTube now and amateur programming such as, uh, the show you're listening to right now, although we're more radio than TV, but hey, we have a YouTube channel. We just don't like really do anything with it. There you go. So I use mind of post pic, uh, videos of Shermy and, uh, my best friend's son. Hmm. I post grants that thought of related videos and one video that had an uploaded trailer. So I can link it on a newsletter I was doing. Funny enough, that trailer got more comments than most of my other videos I put on there because it's some really crappy hunting game. Hey, you know what? I don't care if it sucks. I had to put the trailer up there. All right. Tiger call mentioned, um, something about a Gun Stringer game that was put out by Troma. You know what Troma did, right? Toxic Avenger movies. I was gonna say they do all the like really campy B movie stuff, like Troma and Juliet and stuff, right? It's just, it's SARS. What's his name from? Troma. Um, Lloyd McCoffin or Kaufman or whatever. He's in there. Um, yeah. All right. Let's stop trying to get into the stories that we make up for later on bastard. Let's move. You listen, you don't control the show. Okay. Now I don't care. We don't, I don't think we're even talking about that tonight. Let's move on. Let's talk about our gaming week. So I always like to start off the show talking about what kind of games we've been playing this week. Dark soccer. Wow. Wow. As in the worlds of Warcrafts. Wow. Nerd. Wow. You're a nerd and sound get a life and Sims. I've been playing Sims three. Okay. And um, I played some tiny tower and of course these are all the same games I play, but I like to make and I played as Espa galuda. I can never say it as blue to two on my phone. Did you check out radiant silver gun on X-Box yet? That seems like something will be up your alley. I know that came out this week got like, but don't you want to see the super Uber HD version prettiness? I don't think that we got it yet. Now that I think about it. Yeah, that came. I just, I was thinking to you when I saw that on X-Box live the other day, I was like, oh, I want to play the crap out of that. Well, I was actually going to sit down and play, um, some, uh, symphony of the night today, but I've had a bad headache for most of the day. Damn Dracula causing those migraines. Yeah. Damn him. It is not by my hand that I was once again given my migraine. Loki. How was your gaming week? Um, it was all right. Didn't really play a whole lot of stuff. Um, mainly just three things, uh, earth defense force, insect Armageddon, played lots of that. Uh, I think I have my jet guy now almost level seven, um, and Grand Theft Auto, we went back to Lawson Dam again cause they got, they got tired of getting punked in, um, Battle of the Gay Tony, so now they're getting punked in Lawson Dam, so, you know, mixing it up a bit, I guess. Um, and then I played Zelda on, um, virtual console on the 3DS, so I've been playing that right now. I'm on the fifth dungeon, and, um, it's, it's fun, um, you know, the virtual console stuff's all right, but it does make you realize one thing, and I don't know if anyone's really covered it before, I'm sure they have, um, but, man, that D-pad, I mean Nintendo is known for pretty good D-pads, you know, especially with the NES and stuff like that, you know, great D-pad, or, no, I think pretty flawlessly, but that D-pad on that 3DS is terrible, and that, what do they call it now, the circle pad or whatever, not good either, so, it's just kind of like, okay, which terrible control method do I want to use? So I end up using the circle pad for most things, but it is not, not good at all, um, aside from that, though, the emulation's good, it's just that D-pad is terrible, but no D-pad look good? The one on the Vita. Yeah, there's a lot of neat looking things about the Vita, I gotta say, but I guess we'll get into that a little later, because there's lots and lots of news about handhelds, it's like, this is like handheld week, there's tons and tons of news about both, we'll get into that a little later. Is that it for your gaming week? Sounds like it? Yeah. My favorite game of the week, um, was mostly uneventful, I played a lot of the same stuff like WoW and so forth too, I had to really talk myself down from buying Magica on Steam today, although the game looks kind of fun, I might still buy it when I get home, it's like, only like 9 bucks for the Uber edition right now on Steam, or you can get like the buy 4 copies of the game for 7 dollars, it's like, it's some obscene sale going on on Steam right now, and man, I love and I hate Steam, you know what I mean? Like I love that I'm getting so many games super cheap, I hate that I keep spending money on games I'll play like once or twice and then it'll be all like, oh I gotta go back to WoW. As far as other games I've been playing, I've been playing more L.A. Noire on the consoles, did a couple other cases and so forth, and found that I'm really horrible at the action sequences and I'm so thankful that the developers decided to put in a way you could just skip the action sequences, cause like I just wasn't getting it, like, let me put it this way, at the end of one of the cases, you finally figure out who the suspect really is, and the suspect just bolts, suspect starts running, and the suspect ends up running around the corner and taking a hostage, and you have to shoot the suspect before he shoots the hostage, and like literally that scene started and I was like, shit, I forgot what button fires the gun, I'm like, is it R2 or was it L1? So I'm like hitting all the buttons, and I don't know, I screwed up one time, then I screwed up the other time because I thought disarming the suspect meant you shoot him in the hand. I thought you would shoot him in the hand, you shoot him in the leg, but no, I shot him in the hand that was holding the gun, and by some miracle of God, he shot the hostage anyway, so I don't know how that works. So finally it was just like, do you want to skip this action sequence, and I was like God yes, because the thing I like best about that game is going to look at the clues and going to investigate the suspects, or excuse me, interrogate the suspects, and put that all together. And investigating. It's kind of like, you know, like putting together the pieces of a logic puzzle or something, and it's amazing how exhilarating or how frustrating it can be when you hit the button, like I literally sit there, and it's like being on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and it's like, your final answer is truth, and then it goes, doo doo doo, fuck, I knew the bitch was lying. They just have a casual mode in there where you pull back a slingshot and launch a bird at the guy. But I gotta say, as far as Rockstar Game goes, I don't usually get into the Grand Theft Auto games and all that stuff, but I'm like, I'm really liking L.A. Noire. I like the detective thing, and I'm all into the stories and the 40s stuff, so yeah, I'm gonna play some more of that one. It's really cool. Some comments on Magica in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com. And Fanell, I hope I said that right, says, Magica is crazy fun. And Kaijuto says, Magica is crazy lag for me. Make sure they fix that lag before you buy. I wonder if that's for everybody or if it's like a system-related thing. Interesting. So yeah, I've been playing that. Now, there's another game I've been playing quite a bit of this week, and I didn't know if I wanted to talk about it on the show tonight, because I'm gonna kind of like open Pandora's Box here by saying what I've been playing. But I figure, what the hell, I'm not gonna be here the next two weeks anyway, so if any hate mail comes in, I wouldn't see it anyway. So if you've listened to this show for any length of time, I told you guys, I don't pirate games. I don't download a lot of games, I don't pirate games, except I have downloaded in the past, like during the PlayStation 1 era, I downloaded a lot of the Bamani games. Damn it, I was gonna bring you something. I was gonna bring you President Cat. I forgot both things. That's different, that's different. But I was gonna play the, or I used to back in the day, I would download the, cause I'm not paying 80 bucks to import like all these games. My mindset is, if you want my money, release the game in my territory, and I'll buy it. So that being said, I've played quite a bit of Xenoblade Chronicles this week, and I'll leave it at that. I don't wanna talk a little bit about Xenoblade Chronicles, because it's interesting. The game is very interesting. First off, is the game a good game? Yes. Is it something the Wii needs on its system? I think so. But here's the honest reaction I had playing Xenoblade Chronicles. The first thing out of my mouth, cause Salacious Pop, you know, I was sitting down playing it for a couple hours, and Salacious Pop goes, well how was it? And I said, you know what? It feels like a really, really awesome PlayStation 2 game. And that's kinda how I felt about it. Is that the graphics, really not up to par with what you see on the 360 and the PlayStation 3. It's understandable. It's the Wii. The game itself feels a lot like, I don't know, it's kinda like Final Fantasy XII, with MMO elements, and a pretty neat battle system reminiscent of the other, you know, Xeno games. So there's a lot to do in the game. There's a lot of quests. There's a lot of things you can do in the game, and the world is vast, and it's really something else. And if you're an RPG fan, you really have a right to be mad that they're not putting the game out here. And quite frankly, if they're not gonna put it out here, you should do what I did. Don't miss out on a great game. Sorry, I know I might get hate mail for encouraging that, but you know what? I will happily buy this game when they release it in this country. There you go. Here's what I think might happen. And this is maybe fan wank speculation, but if my honest reaction to the game was, you know, this game needs to have, like, better graphics to really be competitive. Maybe they're holding back and releasing it on the Wii U. Because I could see this game really easily being adapted for the Wii U. There's a lot, like the menu system, there's a lot to it, there's a lot of sub screens. You could use that second device, or the little controller, very easily to do a lot of that, and then you could have the really nice souped-up graphics. And to be honest, if Nintendo, you know, maybe I'm giving them too much credit here, but it would be a kick-ass launch title. Especially in the, like, it would be a kick-ass launch title. You don't usually see a lot of very vast RPGs as launch titles. What did the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 have? I think Enchanted Arms was like the only remote RPG available for like six months. Oblivion? Oh yeah. But I'm thinking Japanese RPG, I'm not thinking, there's a big difference in my mind between a game like Final Fantasy, Enchanted Arms, Xenoblade, and Oblivion. Oblivion's its own thing. But yeah, you're right, you're right, Oblivion is a pretty kick-ass RPG launch title. I should have thought of that. No, here's what they're gonna do. Come on. I mean, yeah, this is Nintendo, and yeah, I can see them doing that, because you know what? They have nothing to bring to the table right now for the Wii U. They've got nothing, so they gotta, they can't hold back Zelda Skyward Sword any longer, because people will just be really pissed off then. But here's what they're gonna do. All they're gonna do is they're gonna fucking upscale that shit. They're not gonna redo the graphics. They're gonna upscale the polygons, and you're gonna have low-res textures, you know, like you've seen with the Metal Gear Solid HD collection. There's different ways that they do HD. Some of them, they'll actually go to the Microsoft, you know, Halo route or whatever, and you'll see where it's redone in a whole new engine, but it's the same, you know, levels and that kind of stuff, and everything's kind of redone in a new engine. Or they go the route where, oh, we're just gonna up-res all the polygons, and the textures, well they're just gonna look kind of fuzzy and smoothed out, but hey, you know what, at least it's not all jaggy like it was, you know, in the older systems. That's all they're gonna fucking do, and they're gonna maybe add some support for the Wii U tablet thing, but you know what? People will be like, oh my god, that's amazing, that's great! But that's what they're doing. They're holding out so that they go, lookit, we understand what the hardcore fan wants, and we brought it to you with the Wii U, and you're supposed to go, oh my god, Nintendo, my savior! I'm gonna go buy your system now! But you need to see through this shit, and you say, fuck them, they're just trying to hold this little carrot in front of my nose, so I buy another fucking system that they end up catering to the goddamn masses for, and make all these casual games, and completely forget about the hardcore user that actually buys product for their damn system. Here's the thing though, like, I agree and I don't, because the thing is, at the end of the day, it's not just about the graphics, and the game itself is pretty freaking awesome, especially, like if you like JRPGs at all, or you like these kind of like, you know, very open world, do the side quests and battles in real time without going into cutscenes for battle and all this, you know, the presentation of the game is great, and the game itself, story and everything, is pretty awesome. I don't think they need to do, I mean, the graphics do look dated, but even upresing or whatever little tweaks they can make to it, that bring it a bump up, I think it's okay. Because at the end of the day, the game itself speaks for itself. System's only as good as the games that are on it, buh buh buh buh buh, right? So- Well then if that's the way they want to go, they want to, you know, bring it out over here, they need to bring it out on the Wii, like it is now, because it's done. It can be put out now, and then they can do a special edition later on that has better graphics or an HD version, and that'd come out like a year later. What's the problem with that? You get to sell it twice, and people may buy it twice. The problem is, and I'm just being real with y'all here, the more Nintendo, I feel like they're ignoring the type of game that I want to play, the more it makes me want to turn to the dark side to do it. And how easy was it to do when major gaming websites are posting, here's how to play Xenoblade in the US, like Nintendo is just being fucking deaf. And that's fine if their ultimate grand scheme plan thing is to release it on the Wii U, but I think they should have announced that by now. And like, I would have waited to play this game. If they'd announced it on the Wii U, I would have said, cool, it'll give me a launch game that sounds like it'll be pretty kick-ass based on everything I've read online. But seeing as I'm getting to this point where I'm like, you know what, this game is never going to come out, and I really want to play it, so gosh, there's this ABC how to run these games on my Wii right in front of my face, I'm doing it. I want to play this game. So be mad if you want, but I'm just being real. I'm not the only one out there. Or major gaming websites will not be publishing how to get away with it. To be honest, it was just how to play the import copy of the game. Well, yeah, no, and that's fine, and I understand that, but let's be real. Let's be real. You surely, you know, there's the thought of what you're really telling people, come on, don't be, don't be ignorant, and I say that to everybody. So it is what it is. It's that, you know. So will I buy the game if it comes out on Wii U? Probably. But, I don't know. It depends if we want to buy it on the Wii U. Yeah, right now the question is, will I buy a Wii U, and I don't know. Well, here's the thing with the Wii U. I mean, look at some of the games that they're talking about coming out of the system. There's like Batman Arkham City. Why? You're gonna release a game that's been out for a year now, you know, on that system? I mean, who cares? I just don't even see a point. Release Skyward Sword on there then. I mean, because no one's gonna fucking care because it's been out for a year. I just, I don't know. Right now they just don't have much to bring to the table for that, and I, I'd be surprised if that system comes out next year. All right, well we'll see. All right, well that's it. That's all I'm gonna say for my gaming week. But yeah, Xenoblade Chronicles is a great game, and it's really too bad that Nintendo won't release it here. What else can I say? So, all right, let's move on and get some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's stories. I will not be here for the next two weeks. Yeah, two weeks. I'm actually, after last week's show I realized, oh crap, I've got the concert next week and then I actually have a scheduled trip to LA the week after that, and it's the one I do every year. So, yep, I'm taking a little break. Sorry guys. But I believe the one and only Tiara is gonna be here covering, at least next week, if not both weeks. I don't know yet. Just next week. Just next week. So, there will be some type of live shows, so tune in as always, and I'll miss you guys. But at the same time, damn, we need vacations once in a while, give me a break. Let's get into some gaming news. Oh yeah. Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Add us on Facebook please. And Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Now we can get into some gaming news. We'll start it off with Loki. I don't take vacations at all. So Nintendo announced a lot of stuff at their pre-Toku game show press event. Some of the stuff they announced, hey, you know those big games that you're waiting for and ones that you may have purchased a system for? Yeah, they're not coming this year. Kid Icarus Uprising has been delayed to 2012, and that's for all regions. And of course, you know, it's critically acclaimed, and yeah. Looks amazing. You know, they had new video footage for it, but yeah, not coming out this year. Too bad. Of course, there's gonna be a new system update coming for the 3DS in November, and this is gonna add 3D video capture as well. And definitely kind of a cool thing, you know, because I know the 3D photos are pretty cool. Yeah, actually that sounds all sorts of awesome. Like I'm really all about the 3D video capture, but the only problem is the resolution on those cameras is kind of shit. That's terrible. So that's kind of unfortunate. Like if those cameras were just a slight better quality, it would be awesome, but you know that next year when there's the 3DS Lite or the 3DS XL or whatever crap they come up with, there's gonna be better cameras in it. I'm sure that will help with the 3D, because let's be real, like not a lot of people have 3D cameras or 3D video cameras right now, so Nintendo could kind of get a jump on that, you know, whole thing, the 3D craze by implementing that. I'm really surprised it didn't have video at launch. Not surprised at all that it's being patched in. You're surprised? The device didn't have all the features that they, you know, they talked about. Oh yeah, eShop, you want to buy stuff? Ehh, that's not coming for a few months. Who's sharing? Oh hey, you want to browse the internet? Yeah, we didn't put the web browser in there, it wasn't quite done yet. Ahh, Rush, no, we didn't rush the system, what are you talking about? This was always planned like that. Yeah. So, November, because you know, they don't like the Rush things, they're taking their time. Of course, one of the things that came out was this god-awful ugly circle pad attachment for Monster Hunter Tri-G, and of course, it's been announced that several titles will actually support it, including Resident Evil Revelations, Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D, Ace Combat 3D, Dynasty Warriors Versus, and Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance. And of course, this device is going to require an additional AAA battery to use because it's got to communicate with the 3DS via the infrared port on the back, and it will also add a couple extra shoulder buttons, and of course the circle pad. Funny thing about the circle pad is, it's not needed for Monster Hunter. In fact, all the demo kiosks at Tokyo Game Show didn't have it. Interesting. This thing is so interesting because, well A, the whole fact that it requires a separate battery to run, like you could just hear the facepalming going on across Twitter and the blogs and so forth when that was announced, so I'll just kind of let that speak for itself and the whole, yeah, yeah, sure, they plan to do this the whole time, I'm really sure, because they thought about adding that port on the back that could interface with this and power it, but oops. Of course, then again, you don't want anything else sucking the power out of the 3DS because it's not like it holds a lot to begin with, right? But it really is sounding more and more like this is the 3DS's version of MotionPlus, only it's happening a lot faster. And I really wonder how long it's gonna be before this thing is mandatory. And you know on the remake next year, there's gonna be better cameras and the second analog pad. Look at that, second analog pad can go right there, nice little home for it right on the device. No, because the way it looks right now is just like a Wii U controller. Yeah, but see, I believe that the buttons are, well actually, the buttons are above, are below the thing, well fine, they'll move the buttons down and then they'll put the circle pad there. Hey, but they got you the BIOS system because they dropped the price, right? Haha, suckers! And then you'll buy it again! That's what Nintendo likes to do, sell you hardware over and over and over again. Remember Game Boy? Coinora Chatroom at chat.orangelandrader.com, Randy says, that 3DS attachment makes the thing look like a Game Gear. A little bit. I think the battery life might be a little better on a Game Gear though, not sure. And then of course, you know, the best way to target your female audience is to put it out in pink. So they have a 3DS coming out in pink in October. Yeah, uh, cool. Not necessarily in the US. Not in the US, in Japan only. Are people really that shallow? I mean, I understand people like pink things, but it's like, oh, I'm not buying that system. Oh, it's in pink! Oh, okay. Yes, people are that shallow. Just accept it and move on. I shake my head at you guys. See, this is how they get away with all that shit. Put out a pink box for a game, huh? Whenever blue systems come out, Megalotov's right there ready to buy one. So I don't know what to tell you. It's on, Dan. What do you want to say? Whoops. Except it's muted. Sorry about that. Go ahead. Pink systems, giant sellers at Christmas time. Are they really? Oh yeah. You can't get the like the pink DS light. You couldn't bag bar or steal one of those at Christmas time. And the other time of the year, nobody fucking wanted them. Isn't it really? Well, remember when I got my, um, uh, GBA? Oh, dear God, no. My pink GBA. What about it? And no one else could find them? No. But you know, it's not really just... GBA, that was a long time ago. It's not pink and hard to find. It's not really just about the colors though, right? Like, I don't know how many of you guys were watching the press conferences that was going on, but they followed up this conversation on pink 3DSs with the girl tailored games, which were, they looked really creepster to me. Like I didn't get it, but of course, you know, it's a different culture, whatever. Some comedian based game, I think was one of them. They have a lot of girl based games already. I mean, Ubisoft puts out a ton of girl games. I mean, there is tons of DS games. I want to preface by saying like tween girl games. Like I don't want to infer, cause dark soccer might kick my butt, that girls like play different games. And like, you know, all girls hate Metroid and things like that. But like, you know, the ones that are aimed at like the little girls, I'm going to punch you with this microphone. Although let's be real. She did say she played a lot of Sims 3 this week. I'm just kidding. She's stuck on that Facebook Sims game. A lot of people actually didn't touch it. What a piece of crap. Bullshit. A lot of people are stuck on that Facebook game. You lie like a rug. I didn't play it at all yesterday. So many of my Sims hated me. But the DS, they did really try to market the DS at girls for a while. Like didn't they have like Beyonce and Carrie Underwood doing commercials and Beyonce does it then I've got to do that. Girls and women were a huge marketing push with the Wii too. Nintendo was just all about, you know, 40% of the consumers out there are 50% or 60% or whatever are women. And we're not marketing to them. You've got to sell to women. Sell, sell, sell. Recommend games for girls, girls, girls, girls, sell, sell, sell. I'm like, you fucking people. Have you seen the customers that come into my store? 99% male. If there's a girl in my store, they stay out until the girl leaves. No, that's not true. Well, it's often true. It's because I don't know what to do around a woman. If there's a girl in the store selling on the other hand, oh shit, unless she's the world's worst salesperson, she could sell whatever it's because that's the only way they'll ever see a woman in real life. That's what I was saying. But now they can see women in 3D on the 3DS in 3D, 3D boobies. It's probably the first time they ever see 3D boobies. All right, no, no, no, I kid. So I don't know how many of you guys again watched Nintendo's conference. Obviously there was a lot of focus on the monster hunter games that's coming out games because there's tri-G and then there's four that they announced is going to be a Nintendo 3DS thing as well. And then I got to say, I was totally thinking of Dark Sakura because after the press conference, there was like 15 minutes of monster hunter commercials that featured Gachamon. Like for 15 minutes, like all these little Gachamon ads for monster hunter games that made me laugh. Okay, I need this if there's Gachamon involved. I watched them all thinking that that's when they were finally going to show that 3DS peripheral. What was very interesting, that add on completely absent from Nintendo's press conference that they did for not Tokyo game show. I don't care about any of that. You've lost me at Gachamon. I'm totally being honest. I should have like called you and it was on YouTube. You might find them on YouTube. You might. They were all funny. Now, uh, Kevin 6L8 in our chat room, maybe that's Kevin68 in our chat room says, uh, in my store about a good third of the people buying our team to young adult girls buying what buying? I'm assuming like DS and related systems or maybe we are, of course. Why not expo? Yeah, that's, that's, that's the same thing. I was watching our soccer. She's, she brought it up. Just a preface. I worked at a game crazy and I also worked at a store, you know, a few years ago back before girls started playing games. That's the scariest looking kate I've ever seen. She didn't even pay attention. Nobody cares. It's a 70 show about a bird ninja team. The science ninja team. All right. Uh, let's talk about the Vita a little bit cause there's a lot of news on the PlayStation Vita as well. Um, first off at their conference, they had this slide talking about 100 titles already announced for the Vita. Uh, things like a Ninja guidance, Sigma, ultimate moral, Marvel vs Capcom three, Katamari, DJ max technica, um, the sound shapes game, super stardust, Delta wipeout Ridge racer, of course always has to be there. Zone of Enders, HD, metal gear, solid HD, uh, Gundam games, super robot, Tyson games, tales of innocence, et cetera, et cetera. So lots, I mean, it's very interesting watching the Sony conference because they are doing everything they can to not fuck this up. They and they are, they are trying to just punch Nintendo in the jugular. And I'll tell you what, the delay of the Vita in the U S I'm telling you is so that the lineup looks as strong here. They are doing what everybody says Nintendo should have done. And by, I mean, and everybody's saying Nintendo should not have launched a 3ds until Christmas. And so what the Vita is doing is the Vita is waiting and it's building up an arsenal of games. So now when that thing launches here, it's going to come out with a bang. It's it's really interesting. It is actually, I mean, I wasn't too interested in, because before, you know, granted before during E3, all they were showing was like, here's uncharted and then here's a bunch of other crappy games that you don't give a shit about. Oh, and wipe out for the, you know, the Vita I was like, eh, I don't really care for any of that crap. But now they're showing all the third party games for the Vita and it's looking nice, right? Uh, by the way, the Vita does come out December 17th, the date has been announced in Japan. So it's very, they are cutting it really close there with the end of the year. And uh, you know, that would be way too late here in America to make the holiday season. I still think it would sell tons anyway, but I, I think Sony's doing the right thing by waiting till next year because they're just going to dump a crap ton of games whenever it launches here. They did not announce the date here, although something to think about, it was reiterated this week in on Twitter, in a Twitter conversation with, um, Sony computer entertainment president of worldwide studios, Suhei Yoshida has reiterated the Vita is region free. So if you want to import one of those fuckers on December 17th, you're good to go. I'm getting the shakes already. Giving Nintendo an unopposed holiday season is not smart. They need to at least, I mean, I'm sure that before the holiday season really kicks in that we'll at least know a date. Uh, I, I do agree and they're not, but they're not going opposed in Japan, which is going to be the biggest battleground I think of sorts. I don't know. I, I'm not too worried about the 3ds in, in the U S because I think, you know, the games that they have coming out, they have, was it a super Mario 3d land and November and that's really it. And other than that, it's a Mario karts coming out in December, but later on and I don't know. So it's Mario definitely is a draw, but is it a system seller? They're doing a smash brothers for that thing. Yeah, yeah, they're doing a smash brothers for that thing. And people are at some point in time, they have how many fucking people bought the Wii because they put smash brothers on it. I understand that. And that's fine if they buy Nintendo needs to do is find that one fucking title. That's what they've done with every system. Every system. People are just like, well, I don't know. And then it comes out with that one title, which on the original DS was like Ninten dogs or something. And everybody goes, I got to have one of these fucking things. So what fucking brain age? Yeah, exactly. What happens if at Christmas that one title comes out and Sony's just left holding their sack? They're not going to, I'm sorry. It's it's not going to, first off smash brothers at E3, which they shouldn't have even really announced at E3. They're like, yeah, Hey, I'm thinking about working on a smash brothers game. Is it in development? No. Is it coming out anytime soon? No. But, but we're thinking about it. Yeah. Just like we're thinking about doing a Pikmin game. Where the fuck is your new Pikmin game that you promised us two years ago for the week? Oh, that's never coming out. So smash brothers for the three DS. Yeah. They promised you net two and you know, they promised that games coming out now, but two years from now when it's like, um, Hey, where's the smash brothers game? You promise us? Yeah. We're going to put it on the next three DS system that we're going to put out. So, uh, sorry. Three DS, I still think the internet as a whole, were you trying to say something Jamie? Sorry. Not anymore. Okay. I still think the internet as a whole is being a little hard on Nintendo because it's hard on, he said hard on, but no, for real, because, and believe me, I have my issues with Nintendo as well, but I think the three DS is going to sell bucket loads this Christmas. I think a lot of people are seriously underestimating the power of that Mario cart and the Mario land three D games. I think that's going to sell a lot of systems this holiday, especially with there not being a Vita. Don't get me wrong. The Vita is going to be an impressive thing and going to have a huge launch next year that doesn't do anything for this Christmas here in the U S I just think those like Mario cart, especially is huge. I really think so. I just think they need to bring up motion sickness pills with it. I've gone through 10 holiday seasons and game retail. No Nintendo system has been a shelf warmer at a Christmas time, except for the virtual boy, but that was before my time. Very true. Very true. I think the one thing that the three DS is lacking that Nintendo should have jumped on sooner somehow second analog controller. Uh, well that's a whole nother issue, but I'm just talking like, you know, format stuff wise is the three D movies. They were showing off a lot of the city three, the year that the three DS was shown. You know, we have Netflix on the three DS, but yet we don't have three D movies yet. Soon we're going to be able to record three D movies. Now have you checked out the Nintendo video service that they've got on there? Yeah, but what little five minute videos I'm talking when they, when we were 83 they were talking about putting tangled in three D on a little cartridge. They could, the lion King in three D was the number one movie at the box office this weekend from 94 they put that thing on a three DS cart. It's going to sell like crazy, you know, because it's so much cheaper right now and they need to strike while the iron's hot. It's so much cheaper right now to invest in the three DS is three D device, then go get a fricking three D television and glasses, but that's not going to be the case much longer come a year from now. Next holiday. I think three D three D TVs are going to be huge, man. I can't wait. Are you waiting to get a three DTV? I want a three DTV because kind of like Matt, I'm a sucker for technology, but at the same time as I've gotten older, I've gotten cheaper. So I'm just like, Oh man, I am not going to spend $3,000 on that. Especially as fast as technology is getting better and better. You're definitely in a better position to wait because as soon as you buy one, it's just like, Oh, Hey look, we came up with this technology that's even 10 times better and it's cheaper. It's like, Oh, come on. Well, when I even, you know, I haven't waited and waited and waited about my 120 Hertz TV because 120 Hertz was supposed to be the three D rate. It's like on this TV now we can do three D when the three D comes out. This TV will work. I'm like, great. Now. Fuck you. It's gotta be two 40. Fuck you guys. Fuck you right in the ear. But that's okay. Going to our chat at chat.orangestonsready.com hit stun says Netflix is in three D right? Actually it's not, not on the three DS. I know you would think it would be, but outside of the title screen and I think the menus, the content itself, not in three D yet. Who knows? Who knows what might happen? Uh, and then, uh, Kevin six eight in our chat at chat.orangestonsready.com says, I'm not really into three D. I mean, it's more of a novelty to me. See, I'm kind of there too. And I feel a little weird talking about like hyping up three D and everything, but I think for games three D might actually kind of be neat. Like I got to admit some of the three DS stuff's got cool. Like it's a little bitty screen and so forth, but it is, it's, it's, it's neat at least for a little while. I think the Mario Kart game is going to be kind of neat, but I think there probably will be a point where I'm like, okay, let's, let's turn the three off now. See with Mario Kart, it's just, it's a perfect example of what Nintendo does wrong and Mario Kart, what they've done is every game only sells like 11 D gajillion copies. I understand that because people are suckers and they're like, Oh, it's a Mario game. I want to buy it. Fine. That's not why it happens. It's because the Mario Kart games are good. Really? They're not creative. They're not innovative, but they're always super fun and anyone can play them and they just, they just last. The one series that Nintendo really doesn't need to do anything to, you know how, you know, they put out stuff and don't really do anything like animal crossing. They change absolutely nothing and they put out the new game on another system and Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. In the new animal crossing, you will get to sit on a bench and swim. But that's fine. Okay. Two things. Um, and it's in a different camera perspective, whoopty shit. Um, but one of the series that they don't really need to do anything to is Mario Kart. I mean, Mario Kart was always good as it was hang gliders. Yeah. Hang gliders. That's awesome. Um, or you know, they've ruined battle mode, you know, after the 64 versions after the first one. No, it was, it was good. A 64 version was still fun. Good on like that flat out with seven battle screen. It was so cool. It was, Mario Kart 64 is an awesome game that I haven't spent enough time with. So it was blocked for, it was awesome in Mario Kart 64. I mean, that's where it was at, but you know, now they're just, they're trying too hard, I guess. Cause with Double Dash it was like, oh look, you can have a partner, you can switch back and forth. No, that was terrible. And then now, and then now they have like, oh look, hey, uh, we're going to have motorcycles and monster trucks and hang gliders and underwater sub things. Who gives a shit? It's a kart racing game. If you ever come over the one year that we put up like an eight player system like Mario Kart game. No. That was so great. It was like, I'm going to be controlling the rear guy and just punting people. It was like amazing. Let me, let me, let me try to kind of move on the conversation a little bit here, but, but Jamie, Jamie, I want to hear from you for a minute because Nintendo is targeting women. What do you think the 3DS's chances are this Christmas? It's going to be good cause it's an Nintendo system. I mean people buy Nintendo systems. That's really it. And people are going to buy the shit that comes out, like imagine babies and fart monsters or something. Do they have a game called fart monster 3D? No, they have, um, let's see what would be the closest thing to that. They have pet zombies. You can raise your own pet zombie. That's kind of fun. Shitting me. No. That's awesomely bad. All right. I would play that cause it's awesomely bad. Now we got to get back to some of this stuff on the Vita cause go ahead. I was going to say if they want to, you know, sell me one, just give me my Kid Icarus already. Soon. Next year. All right. Uh, by the way, cause some of the, uh, audio or excuse me, some of the chat is pointing out that Dan's audio is in and out. He's using the shit. He does have the busted mic right now cause I had to put a mic by the door so that Dan would come in here and yell random shit. He might be encouraged to pick up a mic and say it into the microphone, but unfortunately the only microphone we have is the half busted one. So I apologize to the shoddy audio quality. We hear that. Thank you Dan. No, actually now we can't. There you go. Just hold the cord. Yeah. You just have to do it. You have to kind of just kind of push it together. Like it's a falling apart. All right. More Vita news. My husband's a prevert. I mentioned this in the, uh, over overview of what all games are coming out, but I just kind of want to revisit. Uh, it was announced that zone of the enders HD collection and metal gear solid is coming to the Vita, uh, as well as Ninja Gaiden, ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three Katamari. And this was the huge bombshell that was dropped. Final fantasy 10 remake or HD version or whatever they're calling it is coming out. We're going to do a remake of final fantasy final fantasy 10. Yeah. They don't go with when everyone wants, they just go with one that all they have to do is update a few textures on and boom. Well I think you hit the nail on the head. There's far less work to be done with final fantasy 10 and they can get it done a lot faster. Not even updating the textures. It's just uprising. I don't know though. No, I've given that too much. Uh, I'm being too hard on them because the, you know, um, Ico shadow class collection is actually pretty good. So all this is a third part. Is that out? I need to get that out this it's either this week or next week. I got to get that. But anyways, no, actually I'm sorry. That is a third party company and so it's not Sony. So yeah, it's just going to be up res textures, um, and polygons. It's going to be Konami stuff or Konami quality, which there was a lot of like Twitter rage on seven fans versus 10 fans this week when the remake was announced. I noticed it was just kind of like the answer seems obvious to me. Ten's just an easier thing to remain in both games. Both games are equally popular in Japan. Well yeah, um, uprising into HD is a little different than remaking the whole damn game. You know, one is a lot easier to do than the other. So that's why you don't have a set because if you all press seven, it's going to look like shit. And I don't know why there's so many 10 haters. I don't know if it's because of like the whiny emo voice acting and stuff, but like Lulu is like one of the most bad-ass characters like in a video game. I really like 10 too. I really like 10 too. 10 two's okay. I was like, yay, 10 too is fun and festive. Some days you want to have crazy hat day. It's the girl fest. I love it. So especially because there was like this whole area, like when you're on that long road that you could just cycle back through your dress fears and like level them all up super quickly, like over and over again if you had a couple hours to spend on it. Well who knows if Final Fantasy 10 sells well enough in a remake edition or what have you, they might have 10 too. Give us seven you whores. Here's my other question is, uh, and I don't know if you know this Loki, but some people are saying that this Final Fantasy 10 remake is not just for the Vita, that it's for the PlayStation three as well as that was, wow, that's, Kevin 68 makes a good point. What's that? Aaron was bad ass. Yes, he was. He was so bad ass. They put him in kingdom hearts as well. You know what? Hmm. He was like the only, cause you know, I leveled through the game so quickly. Well, I went through the game without leveling so quickly, but by the time I got to that last, uh, um, what was that fucker's name with the blue hair that started with a G. Ject? No, the bad guy with the blue hair that tried to marry Yuna. Oh, fuckwad. His name is fuckwad. By the time I got to fuckwad again, after the glyph mine battle, I was like dead and he was the only one that lived cause I didn't level, but he was a bad ass. Uh, tiger claw in our chat room says, what about that Final Fantasy musical game they are making? What is it on, it's, it's a three ds, not a Vita game, but it's that that's her river rhythm or whatever it was called. It looked dumb. Well, here's the thing. If the game was like $20 maybe, but $40, no thank you. Listen to last week's show and the whole price tag grant because I want, what are the Vita games going to be priced out of there all going to be 40 bucks to 50 shut the fuck up for real. Vita games are going to be 50 bucks. Hello. PSP games were fucking 50 bucks. Oh my God. I don't know. Apparently my head's been in the sand. I didn't buy a whole lot of PS 1540 it'll be a PSP price. I think. Um, I don't know, maybe 60. The only price I've seen so far is on, um, Lego Harry Potter. And that was, I think it was 50. It was Seymour Guado. That's right. It was Seymour. You want to see more Guado? I like fuck wad, Seymour fuck wad. Um, but yeah, that's the only one that, cause the only two titles that I actually have info on were, um, Lego Harry Potter two and um, dragon something. I don't remember the hell the other one was called. Like dragons, dragon dust or I don't know. Suddenly buying the Magica Uber edition for 10 bucks on steam doesn't seem like such a bad idea because like game pricing is so fucked up right now. Like I just, it's, we're in such this crazy state that we haven't been in gaming's history. Games have always kind of been around that same price, but now we've got 99 cent angry birds versus $50 Vita games. It's all about production value though. I mean, look at, look at the games that they're putting out now. What they have to do. They have, you know, Hollywood, um, voice actors and not all games have that, but they have, you know, teams of hundreds of people, you know, putting these things together for a long period of time versus angry birds, which could have been made by one or two guys in maybe a weekend. I mean, that's why that's 99 cents and that's why those games are 60 bucks because they also have to advertise. They have to do all that stuff. And yes, they can go the different route and try to do more casual stuff and stuff that costs less. But what about movies? Because like, you know, the Blair Witch project was made for what, like a nickel and then you had like Titanic and it costs the same to see both of those movies. Now I guess I understand now that with the 3D is throwing this interesting monkey wrench into it, you're not going to see independent 3D movies right now or right now anyway. Well, yes. So I understand that they're, you know, movies when they come to the theaters are all the same price, but that's, you know, up to the studios to make that decision whether they want to have a high budget movie or a low budget movie, you know, being put in there. And yeah, it's all gonna be the same price, but you know, they're charging these theaters a hell of a lot of money to put them in there and then they sell them on DVD and you know, yeah, DVD prices are, you know, it fluctuates depending on where you buy them, but it's because they've already had it out there and they've already made some money back from it already before they've gone and sold it on DVD or video on demand or however else you consume your entertainment. I guess it really just depends on what the quality of the game is, though, and how much you're into it. Like, and that's the interesting thing about Steam, too, is that it's kind of like one of those, well, once we've sold it to everybody, we think it's gonna buy it for 50 bucks, let's try to knock it down to 40. Like it's- Yeah. We can name that tune. Where I have- I'll buy that game for 50 bucks. But at the same time, though, I have a problem with a game that's terrible, that's being sold for $60 when it clearly looks like it's like an up-res PlayStation 2 game, or in the case of Activision and EA, where they put out Rock Band and Guitar Hero and they sell it for 60 bucks on the Wii, I mean, dude, it's less production quality for that version of the game than it was the other ones. Cinderwolf in our chatroom at chat.orangetowntrady.com says, as a retailer, the greater profit is in selling 200 copies at $30 rather than 50 copies at $50. Depends what you're talking about. I mean, if you're talking about games, there's no money to be made anywhere, but if you're talking about movies, then that's a different story. All right. Let's move on with some more news stories. We could talk all night about how games are really expensive, but at the end of the day, like seriously, if Civilization VI was announced and they were gonna charge a hundred bucks for it, I'd probably still pay it. It just really depends on the game. You're part of the problem, Rob. Yeah, I am. That's fine. Okay. Hey, some people spent 150 bucks on these limited edition, like Call of Duty's, World of Warcraft's, Oblivion, or excuse me, Skyrim, you know, whatever game, so they make hundreds of bucks off people somehow. Some people imported games for a lot of money too. Yeah, who imported the game that came with a fucking dish? Dark Sakura. You know what? I didn't actually import that, I bought it in an import store and I didn't pay that much for it. Hey, are you a fan of Lord of the Rings? Because they've got a Lord of the Rings War of the North thing that's coming out, it comes in a quiver, a leather quiver. I remember you mentioning that. For the record, I am not a Lord of the Rings fan. The movies were okay. Are you a fan of leather quivers? No. The movies were okay and the books, the stories were great. The stories, but Tolkien's writing pisses me off. Are you a fan of guns? Yes. Because there's a Red Dead Redemption coming out with a six shooter. You want a gun? I want a gun! I just made that up. He totally made that up. We actually went looking at guns. I just want Dark Sakura to get excited about a gun. I want a gun. I don't want Dark Sakura to own a gun. Why? Because you'll shoot me! I won't. No I won't. Just because someone has a gun doesn't mean that they'll use a gun. Yeah but we're talking about you though. It would be safely in a locker and I would go outside to shoot it. You're right in the face. We're waiting until you get outside of the house so that way we can say you were a prowler. The next time Shermie shits on the floor she's gonna get it. No. Yeah she can absorb a bullet and be fine. She's right there. Bounce right off her. Be nice to the cat. I wouldn't shoot the cat. I like her better than anyone else in this room. As they put it in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, she's cultivating mass. She's cultivating sleep right now. Dark Sakura let's move on with some gaming news. Sony are bitches. Wait. They actually amended their online terms to block class action lawsuits. It's actually a section called binding individual arbitration. So to quote it says any dispute resolution proceedings whether in arbitration or court will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in the class or representative action as a named or unnamed member in the class consolidation representative or private attorney general action. So basically if you want to use our shit you can't sue us in the class action. But you can opt out. Yes you can opt out of it. You can send Sony a postcard or whatever and opt out of that. I want to make specially made postcards of Sony. That's a big middle finger. Opt out of this bitch. Well here's what it says. If you do not agree with the new terms of service or privacy policy or if you do not wish to enter into an agreement with Sony you may decline the TOS and privacy policy and we will close your account and return your funds. So in other words if you want to opt out then fuck off. You can't use our service at all. So it's not just a opt out because I want to sue you someday. You know the only reason I'm like whatever Sony is because the PlayStation Network is free. So it's kind of one of those you know whatever but at the same time there is PlayStation Plus. Go ahead. It says more actually says if the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable the entire section 15 will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court and you and the Sony entity you have a dispute with each agree to waive. In that instance to the fullest extent allowed by the law in a trial by jury. So in other words this may not actually be legal. And if it ends up being illegal then you never said anything but there is a court case of the AT&T that already set precedent that this is legal. So wow. You know not much you can do there. I don't know. That's just it does seem a little bit. Here's here's the thing. What am I actually going to sue Sony. I mean what are they going to do to me. That's really going to have me sue them. Nothing. I mean you know my cause I see them individually. I'm still waiting on your own. I'm still waiting for money back from Microsoft. I'm more likely to sue them before I sue Sony. Well it's basically saying you're sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. I was going to say. But you'll be suing on an individual basis and not as a class action through Microsoft has nothing to do with Sony true. That's the whole point is like you can hire an attorney and you can spend all the money to sue them on your own and get you know maybe 15000. I'm just using an arbitrary figure 15000 dollars were as opposed to a class action lawsuit with maybe a million users and each of them get five dollars that's five million bucks. You know think about that. It's it's a way to basically save their assets not assets assets and also because they're a bigger company and they have money to throw at this type of stuff they can just drag it out forever until you run out of money to fight it right. It's kind of an intimidation thing it's kind of one of those where bigger than you are so you can sue us and we'll just get scary scary station network but well you may not use PlayStation Network but as Loki said AT&T set a precedent for this so maybe Sony setting a precedent for this in the gaming world and by the time the Wii U comes out with its online service it'll have something like this as well and Xbox Live may adopt a similar policy when it does a little remodel this really needs to be because basically it's like they're trying to manipulate the court system. They should have no jurisdiction in determining how someone can legally challenge. I like this salacious pop is just rambling about this in our chat room so I want to read some of these comments here at chat dot orange on twitter dot com. That is embarrassingly dumb. The only reason why you'd ever need to be approached to be part of a class action and having that class action go to trial is because there's obviously clearly incompetent shit going on on a wide scale that is the point of a class action oh my god if you try to form a class action and you don't have a case and you're just a butt mad neckbeard you'll be laughed out of court class actions are the only real way you can make a company pay huge punitive damages as punishment for their shady dealings in an individual case if you're in the right yeah you'll get paid well but it won't be punitive damages kind of money so sony is trying to protect their wallet that's exactly it i like butt mad neckbeard makes me think of those guys that get up and ask questions at blizzcon well that's exactly it i mean that was pretty much the the point i was trying to make they're trying to save money and you know not basically have to take any responsibility for the shit that they're doing at the end of the day i don't really like it but i hit accept anyway because i wanted to like play my games online so well that's the problem what can you do that right there is the problem i mean not no offense or anything i'm not like pointing at you but that is that's why they they can get away with it because people will say oh i just want to play my games i don't give a shit but that's how they're going to get away with it but because there's going to be too many people what can you do what can you do how can you hold this company accountable like i i still believe like even though whatever at&t said a precedent if they fuck up on the scale of the network breach again i'm sorry this little passage 15 isn't going to hold up you know congress is investigating sony for their fuck up you know what i mean like if like you know they don't have a you know deficit or anything to worry about so i don't know it's just but the whole the whole point is that by sitting around and doing nothing they're going to get away with this as long as they can a lot of people are going to get serious internet rage dark soccer that is how we're responding with internet rage i am very upset at sony well there actually is a number of things you can do you can write your you know your representatives to you know double check the legality of this because uh clearly they're not going to you know they'd have to evaluate it on a state-by-state basis too to see if any of that's going to fly because they have to deal with state laws as well and they can't stand in the way of you know legal proceeding or you can send loki's card with the giant middle finger i'm trying to be serious i know i know the whole point is that it's something that should not be allowed to to pass uh marisa con gusto in our chat room says there is pending legislation about word salad legal agreements but this won't stop arbitration clauses which you are a part of in many areas that you don't even know of that's very true very common like cell phone agreements and just all sorts of anything you sign probably has some stupid arbitration clause in it this country that that that that that that that i'd be interested though how does sony protect themselves in other countries because if they were to screw up again that might hold a legal thing in the u.s but did they have to do the same thing in canada or they'd probably do whatever the equivalent law is you know have something kind of interesting i don't know all right let's move on with some more gaming news we could talk about this all night but so final fantasy 10 the remake is not the only final fantasy that's coming out uh there's also well final fantasy 14 i guess is never coming out but um never coming out working that is haha um but final fantasy 13 too though is on its way out it is 90 complete as of tokyo game show and um they're showing some cool stuff including there's going to be some bonus um features if you have a safe game for the original 13 game also there's going to be 150 monsters to raise and chocables uh will be writable anywhere in the game and i guess they also have a series unique red chocobo as well that'll be available and um i guess the game itself will feature time travel so that's kind of neat um the game is launching uh next year on the north american region uh january 31st and also uh europe is getting february 2nd japan is though seeing it this year on december 15th um plus they're also launching in japan with a exclusive uh playstation 3 system that's pink and black and it's got a laser etched uh lightning on it the lightning edition version 2 which will include a 320 gigabyte hard drive the game and a controller for the price of 37,960 yen or 495 that's pretty awesome i don't know does seem a little weird that they're releasing like a whole new playstation though like i don't know it's just it's just a limited edition i mean whatever they did call dude wouldn't the final fantasy fans have already bought one for final fantasy 13 the original um yeah maybe i don't know um and of course as we said earlier uh final fantasy 10 the remake for playstation vita and playstation 3 that'll be coming out later on my bad on that loki sorry that's all right no big deal we have to mention again because it's awesome it i it's something i'm gonna probably pick up no doubt no i would love to see what i mean obviously this won't happen till they kill off the playstation 2 version of it but uh an hd remake version of final fantasy 11 that's free to play would be awesome i could happen didn't i talk about this a couple weeks ago on the show that they were investigating dumping the playstation 2 you yeah you did mention that but actually hasn't there been a rumor about 11 on the vita already i think there has yeah oh can you imagine if that game goes free to play i don't know what i'm gonna do the wife won't have a reason to stop you now well you know what see here's the thing though the only reason i didn't have i stopped my subscription because i don't get a lot of time to play so it may be like maybe an hour or two every few days but if it's free to play who gives a shit so i don't play for a few days or weeks or whatever i'm not paying for it let me go to this next story which is uh yeah this is this is interesting because this is about reviews uh and so we're gonna talk about game reviews for a little bit as you know gears of war 3 is on its way out and it's it's kind of a big deal like if you're into these types of shooter games at all it's kind of a big deal and the game's getting good reviews it's getting a lot of great reviews glowing reviews everywhere uh there was an article however with vg247.com that cliff basinski or cliffy b did talking about gears of war let me read the little passage of the interview here were you pleased with the review scores this morning asked the website cliff b said doing great apart from a couple of haters magazine asked who were the haters and he said a certain gamer of the euro so kind of uh calling out euro gamer and what was their problem with the game i haven't read the review asked the magazine to which cliffy b followed up you know i don't quite gather it i don't want to come across as defensive how do i phrase this properly when people rated gear 2 higher than gears 3 it kind of upset me because i know gears 3 is a better game on every level now here's the punch line it sounds like eurogamer really trashed the shit out of this game didn't it which they have done to some games and that they put this game in the toilet this game got an 8 out of 10 by eurogamer and they are haters because the game got an 8 out of 10 that's stupid care to elaborate why is it stupid i don't know why would someone just start this off because i mean 8 out of 10 is good it's well above average you know maybe it's like oh i wanted a 9 out of 10 or 10 out of 10 because it was exceptional it's perfect we can do no wrong maybe it sounds to me like the issue is gears 2 must have got a 9 or a 10 from the same website and they dared to rate this game an 8 probably i mean i review scores you kind of have to take with a grain of salt anyway i mean it's not like they rated a game of four and there were some reviews out there on the internet they're rated final fantasy 13 a four out of 10 i'm sorry look at duke nukem forever perfect example like there's a ton of shitty reviews and there's a ton of really good reviews for it you have to look at your reviewer you know that's why i always thought that one of the most fair um reviewing systems was how um game pro used to do it so with their little uh faces emoticons no no no no how they would have like pick one game and have five people score it oh that was an egm thing now yeah that was egm sorry which is basically for me too well game pro used to do um two people back and forth but i liked i liked how you would have the main reviewer who would go over the the major points in the game and then you'd have what everyone else thought of it and the average score is this that's fair i'm sorry first off why does anyone give a shit what cliffy b wants because cliffy b is a fucking douchebag that's what it comes down to he is a fucking douchebag he thinks he's a goddamn rock star because he has a few good games under his belt yeah great okay yeah epic games make some pretty cool shit and you act like a fucking douchebag so wow your game got an eight on one website go fucking cry in a corner then you little bitch it's it's interesting though because like if the game is that good then the review shouldn't matter right well here's the thing then if you're so you know hard up on you know getting an 8.0 and stuff fine why don't you blacklist eurogamer then if you're gonna take the high ground with that well my game was better i thought so because i made it yeah you know what i bet people that thought you know i bet the people that worked hard on duke nukem forever thought it was a great game too you know you don't see them fucking crying the number one movie at the box office every year is rarely the most well reviewed think about that because a lot of people have no taste no he is a fucking douchebag plain and simple i don't really know the guy and i don't watch a lot of television which we talked about earlier video game related stuff so i don't know i i saw him once at e3 doing a demo i think at the first years of war game like a long time ago he seemed fine to me whatever i don't i don't got a problem come on but i i don't think an eight out of ten makes somebody a hater i understand you know if i understand he's passionate about his game that's fine but you know what if i made a fucking game and one site reviewed it you know a point lower than everybody else i wouldn't care i'd be like okay that's their opinion fine you know what if everybody rated it like a one or something like that or if like they came out and said i fucking hate the gears war series so i'm going to give it a one out of ten or something like that then yeah he could be pissed off but eight out of ten is just fine i don't understand what the big deal is well it was like when the websites were giving final fantasy 13 of four out of ten i was like okay these are the websites i can't trust their reviews ever again because they're smoking crack over there they don't like the same games i like clearly remember there were multiple websites that were bombing final fantasy 13 because it was too linear but but i obviously didn't play uh far enough to find out when the game opens with the same time though yes that's fine and it's up to the people reading i mean if you're dumb enough to just go okay well this guy didn't like the game so i'm not gonna like it well yes if he likes a similar type of games that you like and he didn't like it then yes but if you're a gamer that's like well listen you can get a nine out of ten i can't buy this game i'm sorry i don't think there's anyone out there that's like that if you're gonna buy years of work because you like years of war it's not because someone gave it an eight or nine out of ten and i think eight out of ten is just fine but the fact that he just went out there and said wow eight out of ten that's what makes him a douchebag i'm sorry tiger claw in our chat room at chat.org says you should never base your views on a game based on a game review you play these games with an open mind and form your own opinion about it i'm mostly inclined to agree with that statement and in theory that's a really good statement but the only thing is that games cost 60 and if you're on the fence about a game you gotta go off something i prefer that to be hands-on experience be it game rental or game kiosk or something i mean usually i only drop 60 on a game on launch day because i've either a played it at a trade show or b really liked other games in the series so i've got to get it like civ 5 i bought right when it came out because i like the other civ games skyrim i will buy day one because it's an elder scrolls game i've seen all the stuff online i don't think it's going to disappoint me but games i'm on the fence about yeah maybe i want to see some reviews on before i spend the money on it you know but i also think the out of 10 system is kind of screwy anyway i just like if i were to review games i don't write a lot of game reviews because i think i'm a better talker than i am a writer but like if i were to do reviews like this like well we here on this even show we talk about our gaming weeks we don't really give games scores uh i just kind of like to summarize in a couple sentences you'll like this game if you like japanese rpgs otherwise maybe and then sometimes there's a game where it's like wow i don't care what type of games you're into you've got to check this out because it is doing something that no other game does you know what i mean like i think that is the best way to sum up a game i think that's more fair but the typical person wants to just say oh too long didn't read you can't translate that into a metacritic score right so there you go all right anyhow i just wanted to talk reviews for a little bit thought that would be a fun little tangent i'm gonna read it seven out of ten are you going on a metacritic to read it seven i would know i was just gonna see i want to see what the actual lowest review is on oh critic for sure i just want to see if you know if anybody bombed it worse than eurogamer destructoid gave it an eight out of ten as well do you do they well hold on it's metacritic is calling it an 80 but i don't know destructories review scale that could also be four out of five stars could be an eight okay that's still four out of five it's not five out of five or four and a half out of five that's still 80 well you know what i have a friend who basically like whenever you know we talk about a movie or something he's always talking about oh well rotten tomatoes rated this and blah blah i'm like yeah but what did they say about the movie what did they say about the acting what did they say about this because i don't really give a crap what the score is i care what the part vinny and you know me i like your movies that people have blasted if there's fun parts in them i'll watch the movie again i'll go see it again i don't care because i enjoyed it my favorite movies are like stupid movies like i like i like mystery science theater 3000 types of events that's why i like showgirls so much showgirls is a terrible fucking movie but it is so much fun to watch i know with friends well you remember my bachelorette party what did we watch barbarella in xanadu i remember that that was great and then we went to the goth club that was great i think that was the last time i went to the goth club that was the last time i went to good time anyway well to that one anyway i went to the other ones let's move on let's move on uh dark soccer you got a quick story for us and then release dates well basically um microsoft is saying that um windows 8 will support xbox live but they're not really saying anything else about games for windows live they're just basically like um uh they're actual their spokesperson said and they quote we currently have nothing to announce beyond the statement that major nelson posted on his blog so what i'm thinking is that you're going to be able to manage your xbox live account and maybe some games will cross over i think i could see some type of like messenger or video chat tie-in or skype or whatever ultimate direction they go in i think just a way for like when you are signed into your computer you are still within the xbox live network yeah what i'm wondering about is that does this mean that you know they've talked about going more an app style direction with windows 8 which you know obviously although you can use the classic you can you can but they're calling like the desktop is like a type of app yeah saying it's weird but obviously they're going that more apple route which you know is is not too surprising especially because this runs on tablets but here's my question does that mean and i'm totally inferring here but does that mean that apps will be run in microsoft points and maybe your points are used across systems that would be very well that's how they did it with zoom i thought zoom marketplace wasn't a all together it could yeah and it could but but at the same time you know games for windows live or whatever ran in real dollars the my the xbox live does use real dollars in one portion it's the uh uh buying the old games yeah uh games on demand games on demand thank you it uses real dollars as opposed to the microsoft points so i could go either way i don't know well and with points you know you're always gonna have leftover you're gonna have an odd amount they've i think they've arranged it that way to where you buy them you're gonna have some leftover well so if you want to get anything else you've still got to have that not anymore actually not anymore uh they have changed the denominations that you can buy uh yeah but depending on what you're buying you still i still find myself left with like 80 points if you're buying you know if you're buying a card or something like that where it's twenty dollar you know fifty dollar increments then yes you may be left over stuff but they actually do have it now where you can buy 800 400 but they want you to do that we're like oh i have 80 points in my account i i could get this stupid little uh little hat for my avatar i never think of that i never think that you don't but a lot of people do a lot of people do my only crazy purchase i ever did on playstation network was dressing my character up like a hobo santa and i am still hobo santa in home which i have not been to forever so probably dead hope santa at this point well and and to be fair i did buy the taylor swift microphone for my avatar on xbox live actually the only thing that i thought is i had leftover points and i bought one of the steampunk tops just because i thought it was really cute so we've all been guilty of buying some stupid shit online i hope santa is not free speaking of buying stupid shit let's travel around the globe and talk about what games are coming out real soon uh today actually dragon quest monsters joker 2 um out on the nintendo ds also kirby mass attack um on the

yes that's it so let's go to europe in europe we have games and starting on when does the week start again oh yeah today um starting on the 20th we have burnout crash on 360 and playstation 3 fallout new vegas lonesome road on pc xbox 360 and playstation 3 gears of war 3 and resident evil revival selection on the 21st we have rotastic and the 23rd we have supremacy mma f1 uh 2011 and uh that's it all right just a few more stories before you guys before we get to the classic game of the week but first loki yes um i think we talked a little bit about it last week how there was a cable company in canada that was actually throttling uh internet speeds with uh gaming on them and it's actually a little bit of a follow-up to that they've uh the canadian radio and television telecommunications commission that's a mouthful uh cited that rogers own policy which claims that the online games like world of warcraft um should not be throttled and telling the company has now until september 27th to present a plan that keeps world of warcraft traffic and that of other games unthrottled so i guess that's good news for canada wish uh wish we had people that actually had power over here in the united states to do that kind of thing because internet cable companies are running like crazy and pretty much have full power to throttle over the fuck they want well they got the smackdown so that's a good little follow-up to what we were talking about last week hooray yeah all right i want to talk about this this is uh also in foreign country news this is about australia and one of the retailers they are game australia they have a new customer rewards card uh and it's kind of interesting because what the hell is this you use your fingers in place of naughty bits for example imagine there's a guy standing on the card looking down towards his crotch and there's a hole there for you to put your finger through and you can make it a little winky or you could put two fingers through as you could hear on this little card and have a butt clearly this is all just to be provocative and i'm kind of surprised no one over here has tried this yet just getting people talking and so forth uh really that that's really all there is to it it's just you know to you know look like a wiener and so forth however it is drawing complaints of course not everybody likes this how dare you use two fingers to look like a butt in the cutout of the card uh complaints have been filed with the accc that is the australian competition and consumer commission game has not acknowledged or commented on these complaints uh when questioned about these cards they just talk about how great the reward programs is and all the stuff that they can get back we've decided to relaunch the reward card program with its extra benefits blah blah blah blah blah and your finger's a wiener no they haven't said anything about that of course i will say this there is that kind of hidden you know undertone and that is when the major media reports on this it just makes gamers look like a bunch of immature assholes of course you said ass and hole remember the wiener is you all right a winner is you right now because right now we're going to go through the gaming archives and find a classic game of the week every week dark sakura dives into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks hey you kids need to show this game more respect screw the vita and screw the 3ds back in my day this game was the bee's knees dark sakura i can make better boobs in chat than kevin68 can seriously that's right a lot better chat um the today's game is the sims yes the sims the game that started it on while we're all playing that stupid game on facebook um basically the sims is uh a game is this actual game noises sorry yes that's actual game noises and they're playing in a fast four which is like the best one i can find okay but it's a life simulation game pretty much it's um was uh designed by will wright which you know what else he did sim city so basically you can control and spore you can control your little sim person or some people or sim family in their little lives and suburbs and so uh that's really the game but it's on all kinds of expansion packs and stuff and now we're on the sims 3 which i've been playing so basically the way that your sim let's just say that you've got one sim you may name him you know bob the sim or something so they've got you've got npc's and you've got your actual sim and your sim can interact with the npc's and get married you eventually will be able to control the sim that they marry blah blah but you have different stages of life you can make an you have an infant a child and an adult and that's just in the sims um babies will grow into children and children and adults never age so that means that they can stay in their little lifespan indefinitely but they can die from different stuff like burning to death drowning in a pool starving dying from disease and the grim reaper will come and take them away but you have to win against them in rock paper scissors um or you will actually die your sim will actually die and stay dead and your tombstone will show up i like in sims 3 how you know if you kill a sim they'll just start haunting the house it's pretty awesome anyway um you've got uh live mode which is uh where you do all your you know your gameplay and then you have build and buy mode where build mode is where you build your house you start off with 20 000 simoleons which is their uh uh money system and you've got buy mode where you can buy house parts and do stuff so in your lives your sims do have a little bit of free will they can you know autonomously do stuff you can control i think the level of their free will and but basically you still have to make them pee you have to make them find a job and pay their bills and work out and you know make babies and shit but basically you go make a baby i thought it was funny um because this actually mentions that their system of needs follow maslow's hierarchy of needs in which the physiological needs must be satisfied before other needs can be attended to so you know they they'll piss it you know they'll piss on the floor if you know you don't tell them to go to the bathroom or if like you forget to build a toilet which i had a friend do or if they don't eat they'll die of starvation so they're and their needs their physical needs are what govern their mood so the the more that their needs are taken care of the better mood that they'll be in i've got needs or for example if you're playing um the the sim social you know how you don't get inspired until all your needs are in the green same diff then you'll be happy i'm thinking i'm done with sim social and i'm gonna block it on facebook i don't like it i like my house i hate the spammy spam like it's getting bad yeah like there's a little do you need to put a feedback window where you can leave them feedback about oh really not liking any of that so you might want to try to leave i got feedback block well anyway so basically it's kind of like an artificial life program if you look at it in that respect and you can keep playing and playing and like i used to in the first things i used to just kill people all the time and um my friend had a great everybody did that with the sims at first you have to create creative death traps for your sims like it's just it's a way of getting out stress well one of my friends actually had what she called the house of death and like it was all kinds of ways that you know they could set themselves on fire and things and she had a graveyard in front of the house it was it was julius house dan i'm sure you remember that um so basically um now if with your kids you can they can study at home and keep their grades up but if they miss too many school days they are transported to a military academy indefinitely and they can't um prepare food or earn money so basically they're useless children are useless so i mean basically your sims can fight with other sims they do stuff and they can actually be uh locked into an undead state by keeping them from leaving the hot tub or the bed and so they'll like keep interacting with other people but they won't be able to leave they can't even they don't they don't die they're just undead so basically um in the first sims it actually did use a combination of 2d and 3d the sims themselves are 3d but everything in it are pre-rendered so the game clearly has been a success it uh sold more than 6.3 million copies worldwide and as of uh as of february 7 2005 had 16 million copies shipped worldwide and of course it's been highly pirated and um the music in the game was done by jerry martin mark russo kirk r casey and dicks bruce and these people have actually i think gone through and done all the other sim music so you can actually buy soundtracks of all the sim music and it's got its own little unique perky little style you know it's cute now this is the part that i am interested in in particular is simlish which they wanted to avoid a way to um they wanted to avoid localization of spoken dialogue so the best way for them to do it was to create a language now simlish can i play some of the songs in simlish because they're really bad find find the lily allen one find the one for smile because it was actually really cute and the video is adorable um is that it yes there's an elifertado one by the way this kind of reminds me of uh kids bop i don't know why the nelifertado was actually kind of cool too baby language bop well the whole point was with simlish oh and didn't katie perry did yeah i was gonna say here here's one for uh salacious pop who i know is a huge fan of this artist it's funny that's why you hear when it hears the song if you play it backwards it's devil's speak and that's why she's popular listen she's listen play it backwards she's saying that she killed michael jackson to get that record but actually these little videos that they did for him were really cute anyway anyway simlish is really a bunch of gibberish but um they were gonna actually base it they created it by experimenting with ukrainian french and tagalog and he wanted to base it off of navajo but instead just went for gibberish that sounds like the same inflections that you'd hear in everyday speech they really got those bitches to sing in a baby language pretty much i was watching how did somebody convince katie perry that's a good idea cha-ching you like money bitch right here's some money there was a special about it um i watched like one of the behind the scenes for the sims 3 about them recording some of the songs in simlish and basically they are just nonsensical things that fit the phrasing of the original song and they're like you know it was kind of fun and you know it's kind of neat to see the sim version of me and you know so like besides being paid i've seen a lot about the songs that i've seen besides being paid i've seen a lot amounts of money you know they said it was fun they just showed what the lyric sheet looked like and it was all me my moo my mama me horgy wow you know whatever they say in sim simlish but um the different expansions were living large house party hot date vacation unleashed superstar superstar and making magic which was the last one and then sims 2 came out and then we have sims 3 now and honestly i think sims 2 was kind of better than sims 3 but i really like sims 3 except it's so fucking slow ah but now keep in mind there's also a ton of mods out there in fact i think maxis really doesn't give a shit about the modding community i mean they've tried they say oh people want special stuff so they've got their own sim store and everything now but really the modding community is just crazy and there's even like special modding tools now for for like universe makers and they've released their own custom universe maker and since too they had um custom build the fucking universe they had a custom sims maker where you could try on skins and different things and really just do all kinds of neat stuff to them and now like in sims 3 you can adjust their boob size there's there's um uh model modifiers built in like you could even change all kinds of features on their face and everything but people have gone further and made boob modifiers and butt modifiers and hip modifiers and there's even um elven ear modifiers where you can give them a combination between tulcan style elven ears and wow style elven ears or you can just get really huge dumbo ears so it's just you can farm you can and now the first thing that i did whenever uh in sims 3 now whenever i just you know met some random person and ended up marrying them like um they my sim that was carrying around like a relationship with five girls and two dudes like for some time finally ended up marrying some girl sim slut so it's finally ended up marrying some girl except her model was like really crappy so you can actually go into uh um the the stylist mode are you saying you bought your wife a ton of plastic surgery yes i did yes i did i made my wife look not not because honestly the original sim faces and since they were really derpy so and now there's all kinds of special skins and hairs and stuff that doesn't look too derpy and but anyway the first sims is what started it all and i played a good bit of that and i played a lot of sims 2 because sims 2 was the one where they figured out how to crack the animation code and started having dirty things like you could buy dildos and a rug that had like you know butt sex animation and all kinds of stuff well this is a well-timed classic game of the week because you know the sims is or was like the biggest pc game ever it might have got beat by world of warcraft eventually i don't know or one of the blizzard games but uh the sims is still in a huge huge pc game and obviously with the sim social now being like a huge facebook game despite the fact that that thing spams the shit out of all your friends with all facebook it is topical to make sure you know where that comes from well i'm sure everybody has that story about you know terrorizing sims now here's actually a little um bit of news that i just found out i wasn't aware of on may 25th 2007 there's a sims film rights were purchased by twin the century fox being written by brian lynch what the fuck would you do in a sims movie i don't know a movie about life everyone's walking around with a little plumb bob over their head which is unless it's like a cartoon or something and the original sim site by max has been disconnected for 11 years and is now replaced by the sims 3 site all right is that it on sims that's it there it is your classic game of the week pork me do the sims pork me do by maxis for the pcl though now it's it's all ea it's all part of that big you know glomerate so that's going to do it for uh part a here of orange launch radio but don't go anywhere guys we got plenty more coming in part b we're going to talk a little bit about a new tablet coming out this very interesting something that microsoft's launching at the end of the year and somebody whining about second hand sales of course the fus of the week your calls rapid fire news and much more when we come back with more of orange lounge radio welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio we are live on this september the 18th of 2011 with the 428th

launch trader dot com and and and twitter topics twitter dot com slash olr so if you want to get in your twitter topics now would be a great time it's kind of kind of looking a little thin on twitter right now i guess still everybody's being distracted by the emmys emails pretty thin too let me just spoil it for you modern family won everything at least that's what i heard i don't know i didn't really read up it's a funny show though i guess if you're gonna watch something all right let's get into some rapid fire news loki uh saints row the third of course um you know it was being shown at toku game show you know really it's a game that's kind of more for western audiences but one man uh in particular though in japan uh is very interested in the series and he's kind of crazy himself uh tomanobu itigaki you may remember him as uh the uh driving force between and uh team ninja and uh you know the uh dead or live series and you guys and now his new game the devil's third um he just has awesome written on his forehead exactly he's one of those guys he is a japanese rock star um and he's also in saints row the third as a playable character so that's pretty awesome didn't really say god they just keep shoving more and more in this game don't they didn't really see who who his character is but uh he apparently took control of his character um and was punching people in the crotch so why not gotta love it um so that's pretty sweet uh some other cool stuff uh was being shown off at toku game show project draco and what uh project draco is it's kind of like a spiritual successor or inspired by panzer dragoon game and it's gonna be a connect title it's gonna be coming out on xbox live arcade and um looks pretty cool very very much like uh panzer dragon based on the video that i've seen for it so um very very cool and then um this is kind of neat they've done a remake of smash brothers called super smash land not nintendo not nintendo they is no no no no no uh this guy named uh dan fornis um he put out super smash land features 11 different stages six brawlers including mega man uh classic arcade mode and multiplayer up to four people and uh they also have i guess a polygon team style endless mode as well with online leaderboards so you can go check out the full game they have it um available to download as well over at uh it's a pixie geek or a picky geek i guess um geek dot pikimol.com p-i-k-i-m-a-l.com and uh should be one of the get it now before the season does yes exactly and it is done in the style of the gameboy so you know all that monochrome grayish green i guess um so it's kind of let's try to get that chat to the uh to the um chat room as well as the tumblr which i keep forgetting to plug but uh it is there at orangeandre.com there's a link on the left side uh called uh extended play there is a link to our tumblr orangeandreo.tumblr.com because we're hipster as hell and have a tumblr oh that's it for your news too isn't it let me get to my rapid fire news rock band yay rock band nirvana has a bunch of songs coming out in rock band this week heart-shaped box rape me well that's a family-friendly song all apologies and you know you're right are all coming out those are actually some really big nirvana songs so that's that's pretty cool it's a celebration of the 20th anniversary of nirvana's nevermind album although it's weird because none of those tracks were actually on nevermind but if i'm not mistaken nevermind that whole album was already released into rock band some time ago maybe for the 15th or something i don't know they are doing pro guitar and bass upgrades for plenty of nirvana songs including smells like teen spirit the live lithium and come as you are live all those are getting upgrades there's like actually like 10 songs getting upgrades so you can use all three chords if you if you are a nirvana fan uh you're gonna have a happy week in rock band this week uh i heard uh i heard dark soccer give a little squee at this next story uh if you are a fan of capcom fighters one of the missing ones is coming out on the playstation store cyberbots full metal madness don't you know cyber bosses capcom's number one game really that's a quote from uh puzzle fighter oh from devilot that's right all right there you go uh so anyway uh that is coming out on the uh playstation store is that coming out in america too or just just japan well i imagine it'll probably come out in both time to hook up the saturn i think it's coming out in the us as well so if you uh like your capcom fighters that's gonna be a pretty big deal it's not like they have a lot of japanese change in it uh tokyo game show produced from square enix this music sampler it's the music sampler cd 2011 volume 6 it might have spoiled some of the upcoming cd releases from squenix now you know there's going to be a final fantasy 13 2 soundtrack of the final fantasy type 0 soundtrack that's no surprise but the announced for the ds bravely default yes that was a name of a ds game that was announced 3ds game uh that is getting a soundtrack apparently as well as is theta rhythm which isn't really a surprise either uh however there's some interesting arranged music that has uh tracks on the sampler cd piano collections final fantasy one two three an el shaddai remix album called el shaddai and the astral's that's kind of interesting uh also uh i guess something called cafe sq which is supposed to be some type of musical tribute to second at tetsu the 20th anniversary of that as well so pretty interesting there that'll uh i guess we i think that's already being given out the sampler is being given out at tokyo game show but the rest of those cds probably throughout the next couple quarters moving on dark sakura i was actually i misquoted the line is what you don't recognize me cyber boss is kalcom's number one game anyway 50 points from griffin door by me portal is free very very free on steam until september 20th but go get it now because it's steam and portal and it's free and very short it makes me throw up next up knights of the old republic is going down to three pounds 50 pence on steam this weekend actually it's a whole half price on all the star wars games and the same goes for the u.s only in dollars and cents and uh so if you want to get your scrotor on go for it and just call it scrotor yes i did you're so mature i know right batman arkham city will actually have another character in it deadshot ooh and he will be in there to take out a series of high value targets so batman has to protect them and also other characters in there are uh rock steady and joker hugo strange two-faced harley quinn riddler poison ivy mr free penguin and the calendar man that's it that arkham city game is looking to be pretty sweet i gotta say yes but rob a lot of fun what scrotor shut up all right uh definitely get the free portal i mean it's it's free it's just obviously a draw to get more people on steam i think everybody already got this like two years ago when it was free before when it came out on mac yeah when steam for mac came out then portal came out for free but if for whatever reason you just you've been resistant to steam or and you didn't get it last time or if somehow you're like the one person that hasn't played portal yet you you really should just like try it like i'm not just saying that it is a pretty fucking rad game it's really awesome it's super cool even if you hate first-person shooters it's more of a puzzle game i don't like first-person shooters and i play the hell out of portal 2 yeah yeah and portal 2 is so fucking good i know uh before we get back into some long form news i want to give a plug for this um i didn't talk about this at the beginning of the show because i wanted you know the people that really stick with the show into a uh who stick with it to really hear this um because you're gonna hear this on a lot of podcasts over the next few weeks it's that time of year where the podcast awards are coming around and i'm i'm always kind of on the fence about this like i don't like that it's like a gigantic popularity contest it was a lot more fun the first year and i'm not just saying that because we won although you know obviously that that helped uh but it was more about like independent shows then like it seriously seemed like all of the independent independent video game podcast that existed at the time this is a long time ago uh this is like six years ago were nominated that year um i don't think we've been nominated since and let's be real as much as i don't like that it's a popularity contest and you hear about this on every single show it is really good exposure for the show and kind of helps us stand out in a very crowded field of uh podcasts if we do get nominated and possibly win i would really just i mean we've won before so it's cool as long as some independent podcast wins i think that's really important and uh i don't want to see a bunch of corporate funded paid for commercialized podcasts get nominated so i'm gonna just kind of bite the bullet and ask would you consider nominating orange lounge radio for best gaming podcast it's www.podcastawards.com i believe nominations are open until like the 30th so not too much longer this is probably the only time you're going to hear us mention on the show please if you like the show it's free we don't shove commercials down your throat just help us get this exposure it's all we really ask head over to podcastawards.com and please consider nominating us for best gaming podcast um you can only nominate the show in like one category you maybe can do best produced as well yeah i'm not i i don't even have delusions that we would get nominated in those categories yeah right so i don't well somehow many years ago we got nominated for best of life 365 best station well i know how we did it it's because our fans are awesome and because not a lot of life 365 stations had rabid fan bases like ours we may not have thousands of listeners we have loyal listeners and that is that is an awesome feeling above all else like even if we don't get nominated oh wells you know we still have you guys that turn up on sunday nights and then download our podcast every week that makes it worthwhile but i'm just gonna say if you like the show help us get the exposure get us the nomination we'll go to the stinking ceremony maybe adam curry will be there again dark soccer went to the first award ceremony what is it to that she has the award sitting up on the desk yeah 2005 podcast awards for i'll put the picture up on to go addition with uh next to and you saw adam curry's hair right oh your mic just literally fell apart live on air that's why we're not going to get nominated folks yes he had he had um the rock star type hair you know like the bon jovi style hair you know where they did have really long bushy 80s hair and then got it cut into that 90s cut he had that uh and uh let's see oh brad from pod cultures in the chat saying i don't mess with the podcast awards we don't stand a chance well then i'll then i'll say go nominate pod culture for best sci-fi is there like a sci-fi category there's got to be right there's got to be like a fandom or sci-fi category go dominate pod culture for that i would say nominate bobby but he would be he would be kind of competition so he would if he gets nominated we don't definitely vote for him uh no you know what nominate bobby for best produced because he's a one-man band and he works his ass off every week to do and he's juggling his whole little drum thing that he does with the football nfl with his show so nominate him for best produced we don't we just we just want people more people to hear about our show because we can't afford to advertise in magazines and all that good stuff so podcastwords.com nominate us for best gaming podcast nominate us only once it's uploading oh the award we won with unpun man awesome it would be it'd also be kind of neat like i gotta say i'm not gonna lie be kind of neat to have won that award like in 2005 and then like if we get nominated again if big if i don't think any other show maybe certainly no other gaming shows could claim that they've been nominated that many years apart yeah i don't know maybe what other shows from back then are still going i think video game news radio is probably the only one i think they're still going i think they're still live or they're not live on all games they do the tape thing on all games so maybe they they could get in there too which would be cool i'd be happy for them it's another indie show those guys work hard yeah so as long as an indie show wins at the end of the day i'm happy but if freaking blank blank blank corporate website wins i'm not going to be happy so let's at least push some indie to the top okay i've said last year i think it was four player podcast which i think actually um i i see some of them on twitter so they are an indie thing i think they're like a justin tv related thing they do a lot with that stuff which we used to do the video broadcast but they've taken it all to the next level i think they were the ones that won last year so that that is definitely an indie show as well and and if they win it again good on them good for them all right let's move on though more gaming news i don't want to talk about that anymore i've given it far too much time loki uh yes um so let's talk about gamestop you know how they have their streaming service coming um well we know that because the whole whole debacle with uh you know deus x and that kind of stuff but uh there's a little bit more to that as well um they've announced that they're going to be doing some sort of uh android branded tablet or i guess there'll be an android tablet that's gamestop branded that's going to be a pair to the dedicated controller peripheral that's going to be coming out later next year and the thought is that the device will support i guess mobile apps and the goals allow full streaming of release titles to the tablet kind of like on live or something like that very interesting and very unsettling creepy to me but yeah fine if you want to release a tablet that's fine it's more power to you but at the same time the tablet market is pretty crowded so i'll pass thanks exactly that's that's pretty much what i have to say on that i just pass i i don't know i i think it's gonna be difficult for them to do that but they want to try fine dart has to be in our chat room at chat.org saying you're not supposed to say the name of the company whatever you know you know how we feel all right uh moving on to some other gaming news or actually this isn't really gaming per se but it's certainly that uh gaming device that you use for gaming that's sitting in your living room that's soon going to be your entertainment device if it's not already microsoft is launching a tv service for the xbox 360 this holiday season you kind of already knew that via e3 but it was confirmed by microsoft ceo steve balmer at a financial analyst meeting that happened this past week microsoft is working with quote dozens or hundreds of additional video content suppliers how to dozens or hundreds what how does that even work well whatever um xbox tv is going to use the connect it's going to use bing and all that stuff you know like you were seeing in that demo at e3 uh and uh yeah it's there's a big difference between dozens and hundreds there is a big difference between dozens and hundreds there you know working with one or a million somewhere between that i guess it's probably hard because they don't have a lot confirmed right now but i wonder if this is like xbox's kind of way to take a jab at netflix while they're down which is interesting because netflix is a big it's weird because netflix is a big part of the 360 right now anyway but a lot of you know netflix has really had a hard past couple months and it's just going to get worse for them when they lose stars so yeah their stock is tumbling if microsoft pays out the anus to get all these agreements that netflix is losing it could be the thing to have i don't know it's gonna be interesting so wonder if their service is really popular if they just drop netflix you never know it's possible so is there any interest in um um a microsoft tv network i'd check it out i mean if it's gonna be included as part of my gold subscription then sure hell yeah free tv i especially if they have on-demand stuff even if it's commercials if i get it for free i'm fine i get limited cable now fucking fx i don't get that anymore because they're paying for limited cable and actually at my box as an error right now so i don't get any on demand whatsoever um so yeah i look forward to anything free i'll cancel cable again i would even just be happy if i could watch like shows that are on cbs just later when i want not have to go on to cbs.com but like watch it in hd on my tv i would really like that like just being able to watch survivor like the next day because wednesday nights are raid nights so i can't watch survivor live shut up don't judge me uh cinderwolf is in our chat room at chat.orangeandre.com a proud canadian because uh he's saying and canada gets short changed again as we have been with the internet tv feature included within windows media center well hasn't this similar feature been out in like europe and britain specifically for some time like the sky tv arrangement or is this like is this even beyond that like this is just a step further where microsoft is now like trying to be the cable provider they're going a little further because before like i've heard a bunch of things i've heard one they're talking about working with your own cable con like basically it would be like a portal to the on-demand content that you have with whatever cable provider they have um to that they are going to be the content provider for all that stuff i would prefer the latter because you know i if i want to watch on demand stuff i can just do it through my tv you know if if we're talking about my cable provider if you know i i rather be microsoft's own content you know some original shows be nice or you know i or just one versus 100 coming back i'm never gonna let up on that um but i think canada will probably get it eventually but you're you the way of thinking is probably right because there's a follow-up comment here cinderwolf says content will be extremely changed and limited compared to us tv available online sadly he's probably right is that canada will probably get it eventually so will mexico so we'll you know wherever else xbox does business yeah whatever you saw tech tv so stop bitching so i will swap you you can have all the crappy content that we have here and i'll take tech tv that would you know it would be kind of cool if it would work the other way and we could get some canadian shows here like oh yeah they get because of the content laws up there they get a lot of localized versions of shows too like they have uh or they had so you think you can dance canada they had canadian idol and all that stuff i don't think they have a lot of these shows anymore and but uh i don't know it might be fun to watch like tech tv and stuff there's many countries that have their own version of the office so that would be kind of oh yeah yeah be fun all right anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news dark sakura actually no i lied she's gonna go to the mail bag oops i'm on it tonight yay rob mail bag best produced show that's right for your consideration best produced mailbag at orange lounge radio.com

topper of all that she turned into the bingo parking lot so yeah she was going to bingo nice nice awesome uh my fu of the week goes to stuff i don't i don't want to talk about it so stuff my fu of the week goes to vagueness that's right vagueness i'm being vague i don't know how i feel about that rob that's right neither do i so let's get back into the show get some more news out we'll get the twitter topics and skype line coming very soon but first loki yeah we talked a little bit earlier part a about yeah developers bitching and moaning about their games and how they're treated poor poor my 8 8.0 what'd you get at nine well there's a different person um bitching now quadratic dreams co-founder i'm not even trying to pronounce his name some french guy anyways uh he estimates that the studio lost between um five and ten million euro um due to second-hand sales um basically we sold today approximately two million units we know from the trophy system that probably three more than three million people uh bought the game and played it um a small level it's a million people playing the game without giving me one cent too fucking bad is what i say to that what about the rentals or friends loaning their copies to other friends or multiple psn accounts on the same playstation or you know too fucking bad is what i say i i don't care you know what that's that's a fact of any business out there there's going to be a second-hand market for it cars appliances electronics movies games furniture whatever you suck it up that's part of the economy is that there's going to be secondhand sales and if you try to prevent it no one's gonna buy your product first hand make an awesome game that people want to buy day one you know what i mean heavy rain although heavy rain is a pretty good game heavy rain is all right but it's you know people get how much replayability is there really with heavy rain i mean it's a pretty linear game once you're done the thing you know it's like watching a movie i mean once you've seen it so many times unless you're a super fan of the movie you can probably get rid of it and be fine um you know and his other comment is all now uh are games too expensive i've always said the games are probably too expensive so there's probably a right level here to find and we need to discuss this all together and try to find a way that i would i would say reconcile consumer expectations retail expectations but also the expectations of the publishers and developers who make this business uh worthwhile business but once again though i i don't feel bad for you that your game sold used too fucking bad where all the other publishers bitching about secondhand sales you know from their games suck it up hey you know what you sold a couple million copies people are interested maybe that's better than most games do if you know if you have three million people play your game and you release a sequel maybe they'll those three million people will buy it new instead of buying it used but you know what there's always gonna be people buying your game used and i think that's a good thing because at least they're buying your game or interested in your product and they may become fans of your publishing comp or your you know development house or whatever and let me see hey there's a game that i may be more interested in purchasing new and it's by this you know development house yeah maybe i'm gonna go buy it um but you know i i just this type of mind frame and stuff it just to me it seems like the next step is oh i'm gonna try to find a way to prevent the secondhand sales and then that's where we getting the whole other problems but it's not gonna go away all right well let's move on to a story about a game that maybe some folks would have bought new i know a lot of people bought it new over here or put out more dlc because then those people about you way to ruin my transition can buy the dlc i think there is dlc for heavy rain isn't it put more all right anyhow let's talk about uh rock band in japan i didn't know this that harmonix was uh teaming up with q entertainment back in 2008 to actually put rock band out in japan but it didn't happen uh q entertainment actually walked away from it now apparently um harmonix uh didn't end up ever putting the game out in japan uh they said that they were i guess there's been questions that have come up at tokyo game show this week and so forth because you know they did put out dance central which is uh also you know coming out in japan uh dance central too and in an interview this week they were saying that they were very much interested in bringing the experience to the japanese market but there were just some challenges a lot of it had to do with the fact that you know trying to get all those plastic peripherals to an island country i guess proved difficult just the fact that people have smaller homes and all that stuff of course i kind of go well what about like guitar hero and or excuse me uh guitar freaks and drum freaks and all that um harmonix i guess at one point was looking at arcades as a way to do it but they said that arcades are very very noisy and if you're trying to make something that's really a musical experience it uh and you've got 37 other arcade machines all turned up to full volume it kind of impairs the musicality of the experience um i don't know konami's done pretty well at least in the past didn't guitar you see i thought that rock band always had come out in japan but i guess not i guess it was guitar hero did guitar hero came out over there they got the exact same game we got you see here's the answer to that you know if it's louder you put more speakers in your cabinet that's it so it's louder that's right more louder there you go uh legend of zaku and chat says bullshit konami was trying to sue their ass that's why i don't remember that wasn't the lawsuit lawsuit was never about harmonix wasn't about activision i think it was activision i don't remember it's all been so long ago now 2008 that was like three years ago good lord all right uh dark soccer what do you got for us just something about oblivion the european um oblivion fifth anniversary edition release date in fact if anyone's interested it will be on september 23rd and it will be 20 pounds on ps3 and xbox 360 and 18 pounds on pc it's going to be the game of the year edition of oblivion which has the download content add-ons shivering aisles and knights of the nine and in the box are the making of oblivion dvd and a color map of the world and the shivering aisles so we've had the regular oblivion that we had oblivion game of the year edition now we're having oblivion five years of oblivion edition there's also a skyrim video thrown in oh okay and it's not going to have the steelbook casing in europe but it will in the us i wonder if it's that same walkthrough video that hit youtube this past week for skyrim that was a pretty good video no idea but people like oblivion i didn't know that was in a steelbook case in the us i thought it was just re-released with to be coming out and it's the anniversary edition is coming out in the steelbook case in the u.s in the u.s but it's already come out in the u.s it came out back in july actually in the june maybe this is a new new one yeah fifth anniversary edition it was the fifth anniversary huh well it said it had the steelbook case in the u.s whatever um maybe it did i i bought the game like five years ago i'm not gonna buy it again just because they threw in some extra shit well you get 10 bucks off uh skyrim if you buy the game too i mean if you haven't played it you know that's good oh yeah if you've never played oblivion it's worth checking out it is i mean it's not like a job it's not fucking final fantasy it is not final fantasy but it is it's well way more fallout but i always say fallout is more oblivion i don't know it's just it's so different it's like that first person it plays much more like an older pc rpg like it's more ultima than it is final fantasy and that's that's still a stretch i don't know what else to say you can punch sheep in the face that's right you can punch sheep in the face that's what i'll say or let loki say for me you can join guilds and rob them blind all the fun stuff you can do in oblivion some folks in chat are like wow oblivion's that old yeah that's the same reaction i had i was like shit i remember when that came out it was delayed from the original xbox launch supposed to be a launch title that didn't make it anyhow loki um grand theft auto it's a lot not a big surprise um big game series the um fourth expansion grand theft auto 4 surpassed 22 million units shipped and uh which brings the total for the entire franchise to 114 million units shipped since 1997 that's pretty amazing and uh apparently surpassed uh san andreas uh san andreas sold 21.5 million units um and this of course 500 000 over that now we need our grand theft auto 5 announcement anytime now please it'll be next year what causes i'm just let opening this wide up to you being a rampant fanboy but i don't care why is this game so popular why is the grand theft auto series do so well why is it like just such a huge important game in the industry it's basically you know it's you know obviously it kind of came up with the whole sandbox gameplay basically people buy the gameplay because you can do whatever you want it you can drive around be a criminal and do all sorts of crazy stuff with cars um shooting people and then just you know recently with the psp and then the you know grand theft auto 4 and uh the episodes from liberty city and stuff you know the multiplayer has been pretty cool um not a lot of people play multiplayer anymore but uh actually still quite a you know good community one it first launched and stuff um but i mean it's just kind of going from there and you know they also have pretty good storylines they go along with everything and you know their own brand of kind of parody for everything so i think that's why they're pretty popular um sandress especially that was a great game um and then of course the new one five is supposed to be kind of like at least taking place in sandrais again so that'll be freaking awesome all right well i got one more news story for you guys and then we're going to open up the skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username on skype is orange lounge radio but this is a very important story because i've been waiting like a year and a half maybe two years to report on this story and it's not that i'm like particularly the biggest fan of this game but uh this just takes me back and uh thanks to the australian classification board listing uh apparently an hd remake has been spotted of a certain racing game guess what racing game uh derby owners club oh that's right daytona usa and if it doesn't have this song in it fail absolutely do not purchase do not purchase demand that the song be included you know that the lyrics are taken out for the um sega racing classic no it's still the music but do you at least get the the doo doo doo doo doo part yeah well that's the most important part right there i guess uh so we don't know when the release date is but uh clearly it looks like something that's probably going to come out for a xbox live arcade or playstation network something downloadable because there already was like a sega racing game earlier this year right yeah and and i know that there are no announcements and as far as i'm aware no plans whatsoever to bring this game to uh consoles or portable systems but if you do a carmen san diego game it's got to have the theme song from the game show i'm just saying all right one more time before i open up the skyline just one just please one more one more bit of daytona at least until a couple weeks when it gets confirmed to have a release date then i can play the song again here we go come on put up the horns foreign one eight seven seven game olr or you just name on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call however i may make people sing the daytona theme song tonight we may i may need our listeners to uh call in and give us at least a doo doo doo doo doo doo a little bit no i don't know we'll see we'll see depends who you are if you're someone that calls this show every week i'm going to make you sing one eight seven seven game olr or username on skype is orange lounge radio give us a call and we will see what you have to say about we've had a lot of topics tonight too especially between the vita and the 3ds i think there is plenty to talk about tonight you can't say that there is nothing going on in the meantime we should uh pay a visit to our twitter and look at the twitter topics and see what else you guys have uh sent for us to talk about tonight while we wait for some calls to come in because there is a little bit of a delay between live and when the folks hear it actually there aren't a whole lot of stories tonight or absolutely not stories there are not a whole lot of tweets tonight uh but there's a couple here i want to uh get to and let's see oh one of these i actually read this one on horde house this is something pod culture tweeted us and i'd read this on the horde house show but i want to say it here too by the way best little horde house in azeroth if you like your warcraft podcast hordehouse.com it's my other show um dark soccer you'll love this one a mother of five met her online lover who is 16 in new york they met on the game world of warcraft she was a 35 year old mother of five and she allegedly lured a minor for sex after meeting him in an online video game here's my favorite passage of the whole story though i love this part jenkins who's the suspect angie jenkins allegedly made contact with the 15 year old boy with the world of warcraft video game where players can talk with each other according to the u.s attorney you don't say it's an mmo it's a it's an online game where your your kid you're shitting me they talk to each other now like in inner tech but let's be real no one uses voice chat on wow like they built that whole feature in and ain't no one ventrilo everybody's on ventrilo i love this too the boy's parents took away his cell phone so what happened she bought him a new one and then drove to new york to have sex with him in a parking lot classy she called the boy a coward and threatened to kill herself if he broke off the relationship oh that's lovely you know what you know what that story has nothing to do with world of warcraft she is just fucked up yes that's right going to some more tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r we have um i like this uh a tweet from tiger claw footage of the canceled avengers game apparently made its way to the internet and this is in a tweet that tiger claw sent us i have not seen this at all god damn it god damn these fucking sponsor messages hold on i gotta get through these messages let's come back let's come back to this after i want to feel the force i will you do not want to feel the force you want to feel this phone call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey it's cd thunder hey cd thunder what's on your mind buddy uh not much uh i want to wish low-key happy belated birthday thank you you're welcome um the two games i want to talk about tonight are driver san francisco and dead island ah some uh pretty new games that have a lot of people talking all right so tell us about uh we'll start with dead island what we'll start with dead island what do you want to say about dead island oh dead island uh it sort of reminds me of dead rising a little bit except uh you were and uh the uh except the weapons once you use them for a while they are become they become useful they become useless and then um it's almost like an rpg because you can upgrade things but uh it's pretty interesting but uh so like you might have a gun in dead island and heaven forbid you actually run out of bullets and you can't use that gun anymore pretty much oh my gosh that's jank all right well i guess it makes you force you to think outside the box a little bit i mean it does is the game itself as artsy as that first trailer that they put out for it was or was that just like a thing um it's uh when you say what do you mean when you say artsy you know how like that that trailer that they put out had that sad little song and it was all in slow motion it was very artsy like the way they did it but like the game at the end of the day is a zombie first person shooter right or is it like did they try to class it up a bit i don't know i don't know how to explain it well i didn't i didn't see the trailer but it's very colorful i mean it's set like a general jungle setting where you have all these different apartment and condos things well how does it compare to other zombie games is it as good or does it suck or what well i haven't actually played it but um it looks it looks really good but it um i think i might want to play it if i could so i just assumed that he played it that's all right that's right all right well what do you want to say about driver san francisco is it have you played driver san francisco or is this just like you want to it's uh like another one two thing all right why why do you want to play driver san francisco i've actually heard a lot of good things about driver san francisco especially the multiplayer which is interesting because the last driver game i remember playing was driver 3 which was lol lol ah that game was fun all right what do you want to say about driver san francisco um one of the things i really like about it is there's parts where you your body is floating above the city and you go into other vehicles and it like you take over another person's body pretty much and when you talk it it's actually the person talking but you're making them say whatever you want wasn't that yeah isn't that the whole thing about driver like you get to possess people like that's you kind of float from car to car and like you could like possess a cop car and all the cliff off a cliff off a cliff that's how you want to play yeah the real one there's a mission where you have to take possession of this guy and scare his driving instructor so he had to make his heartbeat go up to this a number of beats per second and uh he says stuff like oh if you stop doing this now take 20 off your next driving lessons which where there will be a lot of uh kevin68 in our chat says driver san francisco is actually good well then why did they call it driver i'm just kidding well because you're a guy who's a cop who drives around doing these different things different missions so i think that's why it's called driver but okay because it's that same concept that's been around since because you can't get out of the car you're driving you're stuck in the car forever and so all right drive it off cliff and then well well cd thunder anything else you want to share our listeners tonight any other games you're looking forward to um there's one i'm really looking forward to that rise of nightmares why why rise of nightmares because it i like creepy games like house of the day i know that type of thing and uh so i'm thinking you're kind of a zombie fan yeah a little bit not completely all right and uh so i've only seen parts of it but it it's not actually that scary might scare other people but it's got very creepy atmospheres all right incredibly gory well before we let you go cd thunder i've gotta i gotta let you go so we can get more calls but we have folks in chat requesting could we get a few bars of the daytona theme song day daytona let's go racing daytona beautiful i like it i like he had a little bit of vibrato in his voice i like that thank you all right all right have a good one buddy thank you suddenly i'm simon cowell you reminded me um something um what's that there was some uh previous people talking about silent hill downpour and how terrible it is uh-huh it got delayed to next year interesting won't make it for halloween no it's terrible well if that's what they got to do they gotta polish it up that's why it's going you know what that's probably a good thing then so all right let's get back to the that's probably a good thing then so i at least that's what i've heard uh i haven't seen the official move yet but yeah it's next year all right let me uh let me get to this uh avengers preview i've been making dar sakura wait here for so long let's uh let's take a look at this here this is uh some of the avengers game that was cancelled so if this game looks cool to you like this whole like flying around us iron man guess what you're never gonna play it if you want to give us a call by the way 1877 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio it's all first person yeah it'd probably make me throw up it looks pretty cool it might be fun to watch someone else unfortunately say he's probably gonna have a license for the avengers game and it'll be a crappy brawler beat him up like the other games have been actually i would really like for them to do an avengers game like they did uh ultimate alliance that would be really fun because i love marvel ultimate alliance i do kind of like the way that they've done this where it's like you really become the superhero that's kind of kind of neat and you fight super scrolls i'm trying to see if there's any any other uh clips other than just the iron man there's hulk oh there's hulk yeah it's clear that's hulk that's kind of neat with captain america you see like the shield on one arm very cool thanks for sharing that with us tiger claw let's go to one more tweet from tiger claw at twitter.com slash olr and i think this is sadly the last tweet we got tonight uh but this is uh about a oh you guys will love this an unreal tournament three mod the what they've modded on this nyan cat that's right they saw this cat in unreal tournament hold on because we're getting another call but we'll come back to the nyan cat in a little bit first we got another call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's me hi me what would the listeners rather know you as oh whatever miklatau shane hi miklatau shane whatever what about shane latov yeah shane latov what'd you call in to talk about tonight shane latov um i called in to talk about how awesome neo wiz is and they released tap sonic this week on the iphone or ios and it's really really fun and yeah i forgot to talk about that game i downloaded that on iphone it's it's it's neat what neo wiz what else do they make because you said they're awesome dj max oh i didn't realize the same company they're partially responsible for that that's why you see a lot of dj max songs when you're actually playing taps on it where the free song is like the end song from dj max 2 i just thought it was because they were both korean games i don't know no that would be cool though if all the korean games got together and made it like some uber game like you like losing in dj max or something awesome and pump it up i don't know sure sure um uh tell tell the listeners about this game a little bit for those have no idea what tap sonic is because it was a the game is free to check out sort of there's there's microtransactions at the butt in the game right and you if you want to play like for real you have to use those microtransactions um because as i was unaware when you spend like if you were one of the first i think it was 1000 people that downloaded it you got 300 million points and use those music points to purchase songs or so i thought you actually use those music points to play songs and you do not get to keep those songs once you spend the money on them so every time you play a song you're spending points so it's awesome i go back later i can just get a preview because i'm not a point wow that's kind of shitty though i gotta say i don't like that but i noticed the free songs rotate cheaper what's that i said i'd be okay with it if it was cheaper i guess the korean version like our rates for song purchases are like four times what they are in korea so we're really getting screwed here that's a little ridiculous i can't recommend it past the free songs for that but it's worth to check out the free version for the free songs the free songs rotate that's one thing i noticed like i had a song show up the first day that i wanted to play again and it was and now it was a pay song and a different song had showed up instead so i think they rotate a little bit oh really yeah i haven't noticed that yet i've only seen the same free song go back in and look because one of the songs i played the first day was suddenly a pay song it was weird so um i'll probably do that but the game itself the game itself it's like it's kind of like beatmania with the or guitar hero with the falling notes and you have to tap on the bottom of the screen what i think is really cool for ios is that there's certain notes that you tap hold and drag which i thought was kind of neat it kind of looks like a sound voltex if if you're following konami games in a way because it's got that guitar hero hallway style notes falling at you and well yes that's really about it and it's musical uh so would you recommend people check out tap sonic or no it's too damn expensive even though it's free to at least know it promotes our songs awesome i would i would say download the free thing if you like it and you want to spend money on it go ahead it's not like you're paying 30 bucks to play three songs or something like that if you buy the points you know you probably get a good week's worth of play time if you don't play it like for hours and hours and hours on end so it's not so bad all right well any other games you want to mention um i don't think so i don't remember i only called to talk about that since you failed to all right well my i'm sorry so just shame on me forever you should read me pretty much before we let you go miklotov can we get a few bars no no no no no i don't even know that song what do do do do do how hard is that how hard is do do do do do you're my hero for not playing along no it's cool i'm not gonna make that big a fool of myself i'll let other people that call and do that you suck yeah so since you refuse to play along with the uh daytona you're gonna get a failure noise that's the chat room thanks to you there you go that's okay i don't mind i'll give you a golden round and make noise all right bye miklotov goodbye all right one eight seven seven game olr or a username on skype is orange launch radio if you want to give us a call okay now back to that tweet we were reading earlier here's that mod that i guess has nyan cat in it and i haven't seen this this was epic i'm looking at the video here it's so cute watch how he dies though oh nan cat survival not guaranteed high quality rainbow trail just watch this when they actually nail him he explodes in color he explodes in a barf of color love it it's fantastic let's go to the phones we got more calls coming in hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey it's uh you're breaking up a little bit i'll give you another shot there hey who's this what's your name it's uh cinderwolf much better hey cinderwolf what's on your mind not too much i just you know thought i'd call in the first night i'm listening to the podcast and uh really loving it uh great job so far thank you very much appreciate it what's on your mind what do you think of the stories we've been talking about tonight oh the stories that have been great and i mean you know it's it's awesome you know kind of watching and listening to the conversation sort of moving uh from side to side top of the top and kind of going all over the place i find it's really laid back i'm really impressed and i'm really excited to be able to ask what the setup you guys have going on here well thank you so much well it's almost like he called just to inflate our egos tonight and i really appreciate that i already have a headache because my skull's not big enough to hold all of my ego well no it is and i think hopefully go ahead hopefully it's not gonna you know get too much larger than the studio this isn't a very big room um yeah i know right uh i think it's important to note if if folks have only ever listened to the podcast feed and never never joined us for a live show the chat room is a lot of fun and even on a night like tonight where it's kind of a smaller turnout in chat than it usually is stupid emmys yeah stupid emmys uh they the the top topic will sometimes be about the show but then it kind of goes into these related topics and lots of links and fun things to look at it's almost like its own little stumble upon or tumblr exactly it's kind of like a domino effect of just sheer awesomeness absolutely in fact right now somebody is asking for the nyan cat video so i said i would uh well relink that to me robin i'll put it on the tumblr because we're putting stuff on the tumblr now oh of course of course hold on so that people will visit our tumblr there you go all right you get both well what do you think about 3ds versus vita cinder wolf since that's one of the big topics we got into tonight are you a 3ds owner by chance uh actually i'm not an owner of the 3ds i've had the pleasure of playing with it a few times for uh you know colleagues co-workers down at the office uh really liking it um i do love the option of you know the intensity adjusting the intensity of the 3d feature uh just so just because it's accommodating to everybody you know the people that typically you know suffer from things like headaches or migraines with the 3d technology uh so nintendo definitely made a great choice in uh not in that intensity feature you can go from like super gigantic headache to just minor headache to like to like slurp even like i drink i was just saying to going from like migraine headaches to i drank a slurpy too fast headache you know that type of thing exactly so well what about the vita though because the vita's coming out pretty soon if you are i don't know if you're a psp owner or if you're into sony stuff what do you think about what sony's doing over there well i i don't know i well i i do like sony uh sony's hardware so and even sony's gaming repertoire but i'm not particularly a fan of uh their marketing mode i mean they tend to wait for the competition to see what they can improve on and that's always a great strategy but i find that uh because they're not trying to stay ahead uh in the push everything out first mode i think they're losing a lot of the possible potential fan base uh because you know what i mentioned earlier in the in the chat room was that sony waited for microsoft to launch their 360 console and now worldwide there have been more 360 consoles sold than the sony playstation 3's uh xbox seems to have that much wider game repertoire to kind of cater to sort of all game or all gamers uh of all ages except in japan teen and adults except in japan well yeah that i suppose that is kind of true but uh i i find that that you know comparing the 360 repertoire to the playstation um you know there really are maybe only five or six games uh so far i say for the ps3 for example i'm really interested in that i haven't had a chance to play yet uh but you know it seems like microsoft is hawking you know a new game every week that seemed to be catching my attention too um it'll be similar with the uh the vita all right well we'll see we'll see what kind of develops especially as we start to hear more about the north american launch because you know we've heard a lot about the japanese launch but just because certain games are coming out at launch over there doesn't mean the launch window games are going to be the same it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with that um let me ask you one other quick question since you are a first time caller of the show what was that sure oh okay um i always ask this of listeners this kind of helps me understand what what kind of a gamer our listeners are what would you say is your favorite video game of all time or if you're having trouble picking just one one of your favorite video games of all time um favorite game of all time right now uh it's an old game i think was released back in 1990 on the turbo graphics 16 console by nec it was called newtopia 2 um it was sort of nec in hunts and soft's attempt at a zelda killer uh the turbo graphics released a year before the super nintendo console um and it really has a lot of the traditional rpg elements in it like the old zelda games um you know great soundtrack too even more so than uh say the old zelda games and i don't know i just i find it fun a fun run right from start to finish uh you can do it in you know a handful of hours you know five six hours but it's just very addicting at fun i absolutely remember the newtopia series haven't you covered that on the show before dark sucker i could be wrong but i have indeed covered newtopia so yeah it's a good good uh good times so one of the one of the highlights of the turbo graphics 16 so you i think you brought up turbo graphics in chat earlier so you must have been a big big fan many years ago uh actually i did see growing up uh my family you know we didn't have the standard nintendo receiver nintendo console uh dad had the old calico vision and ataris and then we jumped right into the the turbo graphics uh moments for the deal so i kind of grew up playing a lot of that uh and actually had the pleasure of finding one in a flea market about three years ago so it's soaked up to the hdtv nice have you had a duo no i haven't actually i've wanted to find one but uh you know other costs and other bills kind of trumping that right now well i can tell you i can tell you right now if you're looking to play any of the imports that uh it actually is gonna it was we had a like some converter but the converters hardly ever work um you can get the core graphics really cheap the pc engine yeah that is true yeah and i mean although i do like the idea of the duo um my it's kind of funny my little brother back home actually hooked me up with uh a lot of the old roms and emulators actually that i can just you know i play on my own time here it's a magic engine uh yes actually oh the ma i i use the magic and actually for all the turbo graphics uh games that are out there so far so cool well you have a fan in chat because game guru says utopia is awesome utopia is pretty cool yeah it's a good good series i've played it once too it's good there's just a number if you're really into turbo graphics there's a number of duo games that you gotta check out uh i'm i'm pretty sure there were two actually my uh younger brother back home a bit of a more of a classic slash hardcore old school gamer than myself he's constantly talking about the older titles that he's finding uh but um just one of the funniest things that might actually throw you guys off that uh the one game on utopia 2 the actual copy on ebay 256 bucks you're kidding me nope is that like just the card 12 hours ago is that just the hue card or like with everything and that's that's the original like uh the cd case that it came in like on the hue card itself the little game booklet everything it's used obviously but yeah 256 bucks wow i think we got ours like in a stack of games wow oh yeah well it's fun i'm sure my dad's gonna kick himself in the ass when he finds out what it's going for because i think we paid five bucks for it back in the day i bet good gosh all right well i i let this call go on a little long but that's okay because he's a first-time caller so those of you that call every week and just just deal but uh before i let you go can we get a few bars of daytona uh all right all right all right uh i can only do the beginning because again i never decided to play the game never really piqued my interest back in the day but uh from what i heard it's um we'll take a week next daytona you know that's about it that was kind of the jazzy version it's daytona it's kind of a little bit uh jazzy all right i like that a plus all right well thank you so much for your call and thanks for uh enjoying the show and uh tuning in live and all that good stuff so uh thanks so much i'll i'll be around uh for you know for the first equal future guys so thanks for letting me stay on awesome all right take care buddy we love canadians and we love uh because clearly that like i mentioned he was from canada earlier he's in the chat and his accent his accent was canadian too yeah yeah and uh we love turbo graphics fans too so very very cool all right uh that's going to do it though for uh the skype line tonight and sorry to those that didn't get through but if you didn't get through you should like put some email in that mailbag for dark soccer to read next week make her work damn it mailbag at orange lounge radio.com or you could send us more tweets like one more i usually have a two tweet limit on twitter but i'm being super nice tonight because this is another video and it's from tiger claw and he usually sends good stuff so what the heck let's do this one it's a a mod that he sent us it's super pixel brothers i guess what is this it's a it's a playable super mario brothers but it's only 64 pixels i guess it's an eight by eight led board that does super mario brothers but i can't imagine this at all looks pretty like it's gotta be terrible let's see i want to see what this looks like here so i'm trying to load up the video in chat but it's it's um here we go there we go guys oh my gosh he's playing blocks and under certain blocks and i've actually made it random oh he's got a nice accent i'm gonna try this out five points whereas just normal blocks to get to now another feature i've added is five different colored blocks yeah so if i can explain to you guys i don't think it's literally the nintendo rom like but it looks like somebody made their own version of it on this like imagine like one of those old school led games where there's only so many places you can have a cutout and he's it's basically these colored lights and the little mario is like an orange square that kind of goes around and you can break blocks and jump on top of things i gotta say this is much more impressive than what i was thinking it was gonna look like and these levels are it's sad i recognize these levels based off of the real game it's been translated really well a website run by enl so that's i gotta say that's pretty cool yeah not bad so i guess uh dark sakura i got one more link for you okay so why don't you go uh post that on the tumblers people are watching tumblr are gonna say it blew up tonight all right well that does it for the twitter tonight and uh before we wrap up the show i always like to check in with loki and dark soccer and see if they have any last minute stories no not really wow i mean there is there is an overclock remix album i think someone made for uh mega man nine it's all guitar and metal versions of the song so i believe that's free to download overclock remix site overclock puts out some good stuff so that's good good to hear yeah all right well that is gonna do it for another episode of orange lounge radio thank you guys so much for downloading our show and supporting it and telling friends about the show that's what we really
