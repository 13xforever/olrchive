0	19200	Tonight, September 4th, 2011, a former QA tester sues one developer.
19200	22420	Details on Dragon Quest X are soon to be revealed.
22420	32120	Will there soon be a museum dedicated to video games?
32120	36280	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of that show
36280	38440	where every gamer has a voice.
38440	40360	Orange Lounge Radio.
40360	41360	We are live.
41360	43680	It is Sunday, September the 4th of 2011.
43680	49240	It's Labor Day weekend and we're live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com where we are
49240	53920	live every week at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show,
53920	54920	although not tonight.
54920	55920	He had the night off.
55920	59640	He's at Dragon Con and I know he's going to have a full report on all of that next week.
59640	61720	In the meantime, let me introduce who we have here in studio.
61720	65000	My name is Rob Roberts and not joining me tonight, sadly.
65000	68760	I know this might come as a surprise, but Dark Sakura is not here.
68760	69760	She has the night off.
69760	70880	She's in San Francisco.
70880	75020	If you guys know Maren from Las Vegas, she's in town visiting San Francisco.
75020	81680	So they're doing girly things in the city like going to have shrimp at Pier 39 and then
81680	85240	pillow fights and braiding each other's hair and chocolate sundaes and all that.
85240	89320	So filling in tonight as hosts, we have a guest who used to come to the show all the
89320	91040	time then has been taking a little break.
91040	94520	So say hello, welcome back, whatever the case may be to Salacious Pop.
94520	95520	Hello.
95520	96680	How are you doing tonight Salacious Pop?
96680	97680	I'm doing great.
97680	100960	So, okay, for the listeners that don't know you, well, let me introduce, I'll come back
100960	104340	to you in a minute, but also it just wouldn't be a night at OLR without the one and only
104340	105340	tech master, Loki.
105340	106340	Hello.
106340	107340	And everyone was wrong.
107340	112180	It was a big, and Loki, oh my gosh, we're having so much feeling that you're not plugged
112180	113180	in tonight.
113180	114180	Loki.
114180	116760	We're having a little bit of fail tonight and I'll get to that in a minute.
116760	118760	I'm sure everybody's like tonight.
118760	119760	What is that?
119760	120760	Every night you have all our fail.
120760	121760	Okay.
121760	122760	Try again.
122760	123760	Look.
123760	124760	All right.
124760	125760	Tech master Loki.
125760	126760	And everybody had it wrong.
126760	127760	It wasn't anything.
127760	128760	It wasn't double bacon strips.
128760	130640	It was a double Western bacon cheeseburger from Carl's Jr or Hardee's I guess on the
130640	131680	East coast.
131680	136080	And he is talking to chat.orangelandtrader.com, our live chat room where we are live every
136080	137080	week.
137080	138680	Come join us sometime for a live show.
138680	142520	Although I will say tonight was, you know, usually the podcast people are like, man,
142520	146640	we get shafted because the live listeners, they get the music breaks and the live listeners
146640	151000	get that little bonus segment at the very end that isn't on the podcast and so on.
151000	155240	Live listeners make out well tonight, podcast listeners, you got the better end of the deal
155240	159280	because we are 25 minutes late and starting tonight and the live listeners have been waiting.
159280	160920	It's a very struggling evening.
160920	161920	Yes.
161920	162920	And we've just had tech.
162920	163920	We've had tech fail.
163920	167000	We've had can't get into the studio when Jamie's not here fail.
167000	169200	We've just had all sorts of problems.
169200	174920	So I apologize, but, um, we'll find our rhythm eventually and, and put on a show.
174920	179360	So Dan is yelling at us in the living room to quit complaining.
179360	183680	So anyway, uh, let's go back to Salacious Pop and, um, you're here, but you haven't
183680	184680	been here a little while.
184680	186080	When was the last time you were on the show?
186080	189300	I want to say it was either April or before.
189300	193880	I think it's kind of funny that, uh, now that I actually live up in Sacramento where Studio
193880	200340	OLR is roughly, um, I'm on the show far less than I was before, even though I'm living
200340	201480	with one of the co-hosts.
201480	205320	So for those that are new to Orange Lawn Radio, maybe haven't heard you on the show before,
205320	206960	tell us a little bit about yourself.
206960	208840	Like what, what kind of games are you into?
208840	209840	What do you like?
209840	212940	Uh, I've been gaming since I was four or five.
212940	215880	My first system was an Atari 2600.
215880	221240	Um, most of my gaming was probably done during the SNES and PS1 generations.
221240	226640	I own all the systems and have a ton of games, but I don't really console game much anymore.
226640	228520	I'm mostly a PC gamer.
228520	231120	I mostly, I'm more into gaming culture.
231120	236920	Um, those are my people, but as far as actually sitting down when we'll get to this, when
236920	241660	we get to my, um, gaming week, don't really play as much as I used to.
241660	245320	What do you mean by like gaming culture and those are my people when you say that?
245320	249520	Just the various fandoms and, you know, following the sort of, you know, I still follow the
249520	253760	news for games that I know I'm not going to play, but I still find it interesting and
253760	254760	yeah.
254760	258480	So, but, but there are some games you still do play today, right?
258480	259480	Of course.
259480	260480	Of course.
260480	263080	You still have all the, you have all the systems, 360, PS3, right?
263080	264080	Yep.
264080	266080	The only one I didn't get this generation was the Wii.
266080	272480	So top, not missing much, uh, top three games ever, not to put you on the spot or anything,
272480	277400	but three, if you can't think of your top three, just like three really freaking great
277400	278400	games.
278400	279400	Super Metroid.
279400	280400	Good pick.
280400	281400	Valkyrie profile.
281400	284160	That's a good pick too.
284160	285760	And street fighter alpha two.
285760	290400	Ooh, why alpha two and not just straight up two, which is the most notable, I suppose.
290400	298960	I think the alpha or zero series is the best street fighter has ever been as far as art
298960	303360	design play style, combo system, music, everything.
303360	305000	Dan came in here and give the big thumbs up.
305000	307080	I think all is forgiven now.
307080	309480	All right.
309480	313680	So a welcome once again, salacious pop, and I know you have some, uh, big shoes to fill
313680	318000	and a you're even putting on the heels tonight just to, uh, fill in for dark soccer.
318000	319000	No, I'm kidding.
319000	320000	I'm kidding.
320000	321600	But you will pet Shermie and plays a dark soccer.
321600	322600	I'm sure.
322600	323600	Yes.
323600	324600	Sure.
324600	325600	Me is still here.
325600	326600	Sassy in her kitty bed is always pet.
326600	327600	Sure.
327600	328600	Me instead of dark Sakura.
328600	329600	What?
329600	330600	That's what it sounds like.
330600	334280	Cause in place of dark Sakura, Oh, shut up.
334280	335280	All right.
335280	336280	Anyhow.
336280	337280	You guys are crazy.
337280	338280	All right.
338280	342400	We're going to get into how was your gaming week, but first we weren't here last week.
342400	346240	Not only have we had a little bit of fail and, and, uh, starting a little late tonight,
346240	348600	but we were not here at all last week.
348600	351920	Um, salacious pop and I were at Disneyland, which was awesome.
351920	354440	I don't have to tell you twice.
354440	355440	Yep.
355440	360880	There's a lot of lolsy, funny stuff about the electronica event that happens at Disneyland.
360880	365440	Because if you guys don't know what electronica is, it happens, um, at Disneyland, uh, California
365440	370760	venture, the second park down there, Westcott, if you will, uh, it is, uh, an event that
370760	371760	happens at night.
371760	373960	Which is becoming more like the first park, to be honest.
373960	376920	Well, they, they, they're getting more of the thrill rides and so forth, and they're
376920	381360	doing this huge make over there and cars land and the most expensive ride they've ever done
381360	384280	is supposed to be at that park, but that's to get people to go there because a lot of
384280	385280	people weren't going there.
385280	386280	One of the things they do is electronica.
386280	389880	And we've talked about this on the show before, uh, go back to the E3 shows this year, because
389880	392360	we took Bobby, uh, for the first time to electronica.
392360	397120	They have a replica Flynn's arcade, where, uh, all the arcade machines from the 80s,
397120	399920	and they work great, because if they don't work great, they take them out.
399920	403080	We saw him removing a machine, which I thought was kind of funny, like-
403080	404840	Taking it out back to shoot it.
404840	408360	Apparently, apparently, I don't know what they do, but yeah, they have to take the machine
408360	409680	out of there, because they won't have any-
409680	412840	So he's a bit loose, take her out back, put her out of her misery.
412840	413840	Fail machines.
413840	418040	And, uh, you know, all these cool little Tron decorations, and people dressed up in Tron
418040	422800	gear, and they're basically having like a giant rave, and, uh, playing like Daft Punk
422800	423800	and that sort of music.
423800	426840	I don't know, am I, am I saying everything correctly here, Salacious Pop, about electronica?
426840	428440	Yeah, sounds about right.
428440	431920	So we love electronica, because we're nerds, and we love Tron.
431920	435280	Like Tron is like one of the greatest Disney products there is, right?
435280	439360	Electronica was not supposed to be at the park anymore, it was supposed to finish not
439360	443040	long after the movie came out, and it's been extended time and time and time again.
443040	447980	And the most recent news on the net was it's being extended through spring 2012, which
447980	454000	that's great news, because, uh, that means, uh, you can enjoy Flynn's arcade, and the,
454000	458560	you know, perfect 80s actual arcade machines for just that much longer, and those of us
458560	461520	that are nerds and huge fans of Tron's are happy.
461520	467080	But while we were at the park, I was talking to an employee kind of candidly about electronica,
467080	471440	and he said, well yeah, you know, it's closing after Labor Day, and we were like, what?
471440	474560	It's closing after Labor Day, but we heard it was spring 2012, and we have like all these
474560	478080	people that we know that are coming to the park in October, like just to go to electronica
478080	480160	and check it out before it closes.
480160	484880	And he was like, well yeah, it's closing after Labor Day, and it's, you know, it's probably
484880	486360	going to come back in a different configuration.
486360	491960	And we were like, oh my gosh, so making posts to Facebook, angry friends making comments
491960	494360	about how could electronica close before they see it.
494360	498360	It was like telling a bunch of preschoolers that Santa Claus had died.
498360	499360	Yeah, basically.
499360	501160	They were like, what, no!
501160	505080	It was, yeah, or just like just slapping ice cream out of their hand.
505080	506080	Same reaction.
506080	507080	What is that?
507080	508080	What is that thing?
508080	509080	Coning or whatever.
509080	511040	It's like that where you grab the top of the cone, that dumbass thing.
511040	512040	So it was stupid.
512040	513720	Yes, it was.
513720	520640	So anyhow, to make a long story short, too late, I know, we found out that yes, a lot
520640	526000	of electronica is closing after Labor Day, but for three weeks, then it's coming back
526000	527000	weekends only.
527000	531120	You have to understand, they're putting electronica in the Disney vault, and then they're going
531120	536600	to re-release it later on as a special edition, because that's what Disney does with everything.
536600	538220	So finally, we figured that out.
538220	541480	So my friends that are going to the park in October are happy because they'll get to see
541480	544760	it because they're going on a weekend, so it doesn't matter that it's weekends only.
544760	545760	It's fine.
545760	550920	Nick Latov was going to be going the week before it reopens, and now he's pissed.
550920	554120	So I'm not supposed to probably be talking about that on the show, but oh well, what
554120	555120	are you going to do?
555120	561080	And look at that, he just joined chat to stomp and pout with our chatters at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
561080	567280	So, yeah, so we had fun at Disneyland and electronica and all that, and so that's where
567280	570680	we were last week, and we just ended up having the show off, because Jamie was helping a
570680	574680	friend move, and you know, Logie's got the kids, so he enjoys a week off.
574680	578840	When electronica reopens after this three week renovation or whatever, it's going to
578840	580560	be smaller, right?
580560	582600	Because of all the construction they're doing, or was that just a-
582600	583600	Oh, probably.
583600	584600	California Adventure's a mess right now.
584600	587440	And Flynn's Arcade, is that still going to be there, or do you think they're taking that
587440	588440	out?
588440	589440	I hope they don't take it out.
589440	592160	I don't know how it ties back into gaming, because I'll tell you what, if you're in Southern
592160	597280	California, I do think you need to see electronica at least once, because that arcade is awesome.
597280	600160	It's like, it's just like the arcade in the movie, and all the machines actually work,
600160	603200	and how often do you get to go to an arcade where the machines freaking work?
603200	605920	That's when Starrcade is ruined, they should make it permanent.
605920	608440	Dan is saying since Starrcade is ruined, they should just make it permanent.
608440	609440	They should.
609440	610880	They should move Flynn's into Starrcade.
610880	612560	But here's the rumors about the replacement.
612560	616480	I don't mean to turn this into a Disney podcast, but deal.
616480	620480	They're going to replace electronica with the mad tea party.
620480	621480	Based off of the Tim Burton.
621480	625340	Based off of the terrible Tim Burton version of Alice in Wonderland.
625340	628400	But if you think about it, it's going to be so easy to convert.
628400	634320	All they have to do, get Zeus a mad hatter outfit, get all the dancers little, you know,
634320	639160	wacky colors and stuff, and then close Flynn's Arcade or turn it into a tea room or something.
639160	640680	I hope that doesn't happen.
640680	644920	I think Flynn's Arcade should stay a fixture, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
644920	649920	Well, they need to move Flynn's Arcade to the part that's next to Space Mountain.
649920	652360	Because they're used to have Tron stuff in Tomorrowland.
652360	656000	Well, you see, here's the thing, though, is that since Star Tours is all new, they want
656000	658340	all that business in the area or what have you.
658340	659340	So I don't know.
659340	660340	It would be nice.
660340	666160	But sadly, there's just not a lot of arcade love in the world anymore.
666160	667840	And I think that even at Disneyland you're seeing it.
667840	672560	Get rid of that stupid, imaginary, spinning piece of crap that was there.
672560	674020	How fucking badass would it be?
674020	679640	If they would take that dome and turn it into some type of, like, light disc battle.
679640	680640	Like a battle arena.
680640	682240	Like a Tron battle arena.
682240	685760	Where there could be a ride where you go around in a little light bike or something and it
685760	686760	could just be all neon inside.
686760	691140	I mean, it would cost hella money to renovate that place, but it would be awesome.
691140	693080	Like a battle grid or something in Tomorrowland.
693080	694080	It would be so badass.
694080	698000	Or it would have been even more badass as if, well, I know people keep killing themselves
698000	701760	on the goddamn rides, but like, remember when they had the rocket rods and stuff like that
701760	705040	and it would go around on that, make that as a Tron.
705040	706920	In the 80s, it was a Tron thing.
706920	708920	The people mover had a Tron tunnel.
708920	709920	The light speed Tron tunnel.
709920	710920	Yeah, I remember that.
710920	712920	Back when the first Tron movie was new.
712920	713920	So it was very old.
713920	716100	I remember that, but remember the rocket rods went really fast.
716100	721820	So have like some sort of motorcycle ride thing that'd be sweet.
721820	726800	And you can find Marvel merchandise at Disneyland now because of, you know, not really a merger.
726800	727800	They bought Marvel outright.
727800	728800	Right, yeah.
728800	732720	In a lot of the Disney merch stores, you can find Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, action
732720	736120	figures, the three 16 week games, all that stuff.
736120	740040	So we're going to see some of those themed rides because you know how like all these
740040	741960	Six Flags stuff have the DC rides.
741960	742960	Yeah, that's right.
742960	746320	They have the Superman and Superman, Batman and all.
746320	750580	I again, I don't mean to turn this into a Disney podcast, but whatever.
750580	752720	It's an off night tonight anyway.
752720	753720	Here's the thing.
753720	757940	I think if Disney ever does do a third gate in Anaheim, which they have the space for,
757940	760320	but it would mean California Adventure has got to be successful.
760320	764200	I think if they do a third park, they might do like a third park about like Marvel stuff
764200	766640	and it could even be a thrill ride park to compete with Magic Mountain.
766640	767640	But I don't know.
767640	769460	I'm not going to hold my breath.
769460	772940	And the Disney doesn't really have thrill parks because they're not very family friendly,
772940	773940	but I don't know.
773940	774940	I think one could be successful there.
774940	778840	I think that's what kind of California Adventure is kind of, it started off as, okay, we're
778840	781640	going to try everything that didn't really kind of fit in Disneyland.
781640	787040	And now it's like, ah, we need more Disneyland in here.
787040	789560	Coming to our chat room for some comments, the chat.orangelandtrady.com, at least the
789560	791160	chatters are into this tonight.
791160	794640	Tiger Claw says they will bring Electronica back when Tron 3 comes out.
794640	796040	You know, that's a distinct possibility.
796040	798960	I hope to God it's true they're making a Tron 3.
798960	804160	I heard the Bruce Boxliner interview that 2013, and they certainly have loaded it and
804160	806220	set it up for one in the Blu-ray.
806220	809600	So I really hope that does happen.
809600	812560	Dark Tetsuya says Rob should work for Disney Imagineering.
812560	816520	Act Def says if any Disney employee is listening, they should hire Rob as an Imagineer.
816520	817520	Oh, I would love that.
817520	820320	In fact, I would just turn everything into Tron in Tomorrowland.
820320	821800	Hey, I'm down.
821800	822800	Autotopia, Nickatron.
822800	825640	I can Imagineer like Space Mountain Tron.
825640	827360	I can Imagineer like anything.
827360	830600	I mean, just whatever you need, I'll Imagineer.
830600	831600	Build it?
831600	836040	No, I'm not really good at doing that part, but hell, I can imagine all sorts of crazy
836040	837040	things.
837040	840080	Okay, the last thing I'll say on Disney, Frisbee in our chat room at chat.orangelandtrady.com
840080	844080	says and have Rob host the new Disney podcast, Orange Lounge Disneyel.
844080	847440	Well, you know, we've been teasing the idea of a third podcast for a while and I will
847440	848440	say this isn't it.
848440	852200	But one of the ideas that was tossed around was doing like a Disney type podcast.
852200	856180	But the problem with that is that Disney is supposed to be a very family friendly thing.
856180	858840	And we have a lot of very foul mouths around.
858840	861400	So I don't know if the two worlds would combine very well.
861400	866880	I think there would be a niche audience for a Disney mature podcast like, you know, fuck
866880	870440	the kids Disneyland's for me like that would probably be the name of it.
870440	874000	But I don't know how well that would do and how much Disney would approve of something
874000	875000	like that.
875000	876720	So didn't happen.
876720	879200	Disneyland's just something we really like.
879200	881200	So anyhow, let's go back to games.
881200	882620	So we were off for a week.
882620	887120	So we don't have a lot of news in the show world tonight about what happened last week.
887120	889840	But I've got to talk about must say PAX happened.
889840	893760	But I don't think that was really PAX happened and surprisingly not a ton of news out of
893760	894760	PAX.
894760	896520	I mean, a lot of it was seen and so forth.
896520	897520	Yes.
897520	899080	And expansions, a few things like that.
899080	900260	But nothing major.
900260	902160	And I was proven wrong.
902160	904000	You know, games analysts aren't always right.
904000	907600	I thought for sure Nintendo would announce those games, Xenoblade and so forth coming
907600	908600	out here.
908600	910040	They did not take the opportunity to at PAX.
910040	911040	I don't think it's happened.
911040	912600	They didn't do much of anything at PAX, did they?
912600	913600	No.
913600	915360	In fact, I didn't really hear even what they were showing at their booth.
915360	917320	I imagine it was all the 3DS stuff.
917320	918480	That's got to be what they were.
918480	920600	Well, they announced what some new 3DS stuff.
920600	922000	But we'll get into that later.
922000	929060	And then yeah, it's it's pretty and it's funny is they haven't really even announced the
929060	931960	dates yet for the two Mario games on the 3DS.
931960	934440	It's just we know it's November, December.
934440	939480	But you know, they've already announced everything up through the end of November.
939480	940480	Where are those titles?
940480	945680	Oh, well, we'll we'll come back to that, you know, figure it out, you know, see how well
945680	947520	these other games do.
947520	952800	So the big news that happened last week was about a company I've been critical of on this
952800	953800	show in the past.
953800	954800	It was GameStop.
954800	956640	As I like I like Bobby's name for him.
956640	960000	I think I might Jack the name Evil G is what he always calls him on the show.
960000	961000	I might call him that.
961000	964120	But I don't mean to disrespect the people working the front lines at the stores and
964120	965120	so forth.
965120	969360	Because, you know, I understand those of you that make very little money serving the customer
969360	976120	directly are in a very thankless job and my beef with Evil G is not with those people.
976120	979720	Although I some do get a bad rap and I have been to some stores where those guys are a
979720	980720	holes.
980720	981920	But that's not my beef.
981920	985800	My beef with GameStop has to do with a much higher management and some of the ways some
985800	988240	of the decisions they make and some of the ways that they run their company.
988240	991900	And funny enough a lot of that came to light this last week.
991900	995760	I'm sure I don't need to report this I'm sure all of you have heard this or read it on a
995760	996760	gaming blog somewhere.
996760	1000460	But if you've been living in a cave I'll kind of sum it up for you.
1000460	1002640	New game was released last week.
1002640	1006520	I always say Deus Ex but it's Deus Ex Deus Ex.
1006520	1009960	And the PC version came out and it was announced on the Internet about two days before it came
1009960	1014240	out that it was going to come with a coupon so you get the game for free on on live which
1014240	1019160	of course is the streaming service that everybody laughed at three years ago until they showed
1019160	1023840	up at E3 and was like no really people you're going to stream these games over the Internet
1023840	1024840	and it fucking works.
1024840	1027840	And everybody's like holy fuck it does work.
1027840	1031800	Now on live's biggest challenge is they have no games like they have very few games on
1031800	1032800	their service.
1032800	1036360	But to get a new game like Deus Ex is a big coup for them.
1036360	1039660	So they want to show off their service try to get more people on on live and get people
1039660	1041080	buying games over there.
1041080	1044600	So they put in a coupon some type of partnership with Square Enix where you would be able to
1044600	1048320	get a free version of Deus Ex on on live with the PC version.
1048320	1053000	Well Evil G didn't like that because Evil G just recently bought one of these online
1053000	1057880	streaming companies a competitor of on live if you will and clearly plans to launch their
1057880	1059440	own service.
1059440	1065440	So an internal memo was leaked to the Internet where Evil G told their employees essentially
1065440	1071800	to go open all of the boxes of Deus Ex on the PC take out the code and throw them away.
1071800	1072880	And that's that.
1072880	1077200	And so obviously a lot of people not happy to know that the employees opened the product
1077200	1081040	and took something out of it and then sold it as new and then sold it as new.
1081040	1087280	Which is funny to me because this isn't a new policy at the G. This is not something
1087280	1088280	new for them.
1088280	1092860	We've heard for years on the Internet and so forth about how they open games let employees
1092860	1097200	rent them and take them home and then bring them back to the store and sell them as a
1097200	1098200	new game.
1098200	1099380	Sometimes they reshrink them.
1099380	1104440	This is nothing new but I guess for whatever reason this is what has pushed people over
1104440	1109520	the edge and I think what it is is that now it's really something of value came out of
1109520	1110520	the box.
1110520	1115960	You know that coupon for all practical purposes was a fifty dollar value although let's be
1115960	1121720	real I'm sure you can't cross save the on live servers don't talk to the PC yet.
1121720	1125340	So this on live thing and you're playing your normal version on the PC anyway.
1125340	1130420	This on live thing is really just a oh neat I have it I play it for five minutes and then
1130420	1131920	need I saw it I'm done.
1131920	1136880	Like I bet very very very very few people are truly using that coupon.
1136880	1141100	But because that coupon you feel like it's a fifty dollar value now evil G has ripped
1141100	1143200	that out of your hands and you're pissed.
1143200	1147240	And now there's an issue with the policy that they've been doing for years.
1147240	1152680	And so this all came to light and it's been really really bad for them.
1152680	1154260	Here's the surprising thing.
1154260	1158420	I'm slightly sympathetic towards GameStop.
1158420	1163560	I actually think it was kind of screwed up of Squeenix to include a competitor's coupon
1163560	1167120	and not tell evil G what they were doing.
1167120	1171640	The appropriate response is what GameStop did at the end of the day.
1171640	1175520	Finally the next day or maybe very late that day they said you know what we're taking this
1175520	1179680	game off our shelves altogether and we're sending the boxes back to Square Enix.
1179680	1181720	That's what should have been done in the first place.
1181720	1185440	If it had been done in the first place none of this would have ever happened.
1185440	1186760	They wouldn't have had the bad rap.
1186760	1191320	I mean sure there'd be people to go oh GameStop won't sell Deus Ex on the PC too good huh
1191320	1197300	but it's not like it's unheard of that a store doesn't sell a certain product right.
1197300	1199800	Like most RadioShacks don't sell video games.
1199800	1202920	If you go in there and ask for a copy of a new game on the PC and they say we don't have
1202920	1203920	it.
1203920	1205360	Well what the fuck you don't have it right.
1205360	1208840	You just oh OK I guess I'll go next door to Target or whatever right.
1208840	1211320	But what it did is it just brought this whole thing to light up.
1211320	1215840	You mean they're opening new things and then reselling them as new like who the fuck does
1215840	1216840	that.
1216840	1217840	Best Buy doesn't do that.
1217840	1218840	Target doesn't do that.
1218840	1219840	Walmart doesn't.
1219840	1222280	Because if you think about it like let's just take it to the extreme here what if they were
1222280	1228960	say there is some bonus download content that came with a game like say Gears of War something
1228960	1232640	like that comes with like a map pack or something like that and they say hey you know what we're
1232640	1235480	going to break open all the copies of Gears of War we're going to take it out and we're
1235480	1238480	going to sell that map pack separately and then we're also going to sell the game as
1238480	1240000	new.
1240000	1244680	So it's brought this policy of theirs to light and part of me of course is doing the Nelson
1244680	1248640	laugh pointing and going you know I've been telling you guys for a while this is part
1248640	1253760	of their crap policies and so forth but you know whatever I'm sure people will forget
1253760	1256960	about this in a couple weeks and continue to buy their games from there.
1256960	1260340	But it was interesting to kind of see that all come to light and I think the appropriate
1260340	1262660	response was what happened at the end of the day.
1262660	1267240	But unfortunately GameStop is too comfortable with let's open new things and then resell
1267240	1270480	them as new and finally the public was like wait a minute you can't do that.
1270480	1277460	When I go to Fry's and that's been done there's an open box that's cheaper that I buy because
1277460	1279460	the box has been opened.
1279460	1280460	That's the way it works right.
1280460	1282120	They thought that no one would know.
1282120	1286040	They thought that no one's going to know that they did this and then on top of that they
1286040	1290840	also thought hey you know what well and this is actually what they did because they they
1290840	1296680	made Square Enix apologize to them and they're like oh yeah we're OK with them taking that
1296680	1297680	stuff back.
1297680	1298680	Yeah you know why?
1298680	1299680	Because they're GameStop.
1299680	1304280	GameStop says oh no fucking you didn't we're not going to sell your fucking games anymore
1304280	1308200	and they're like oh wait a second we'll go ahead and take those games back we're sorry
1308200	1310140	we shouldn't have ever done that.
1310140	1313980	And we as the consumer have given GameStop that monopoly.
1313980	1314980	Oh yeah.
1314980	1318160	And if you want that shit to stop you need to take it away.
1318160	1319600	You need to take that monopoly away.
1319600	1320600	There is nothing.
1320600	1321600	I'm not going to hold my breath.
1321600	1322600	There is nothing.
1322600	1324800	Why do people go to GameStop in the first place.
1324800	1327940	Oh because you get a little bit extra download content and stuff like that.
1327940	1328940	Think about it.
1328940	1330500	Do you really care if you get an extra skin.
1330500	1334280	Oh if your hat is orange now instead of green or something like that.
1334280	1339400	I mean just they're not the only company out there that sells games.
1339400	1341940	They're not even the best company out there that sells games.
1341940	1349360	I mean they're just it's just something you know a product you can go to a bunch of other
1349360	1353600	stores and buy that product and guess what those stores didn't take out the coupons for
1353600	1355600	on live.
1355600	1358320	It's because they feel that they have this new service.
1358320	1362240	Well can you wait and see what's going to happen when that new streaming service comes
1362240	1364160	around.
1364160	1366640	That's going to be fun.
1366640	1371320	I think that it might have been on a Bobby Black Wolf show last week or the week before
1371320	1378720	someone had called in and said that they had worked at a indie game retail shop and that
1378720	1383200	they offered much better trade in credit for used games and GameStop did but they could
1383200	1389320	not get people to shop there because oh if I get the game at GameStop and my green dude
1389320	1392800	will get a costume code for a slightly lighter shade of green.
1392800	1394200	And people eat that shit up.
1394200	1396120	They do eat that shit up and it's sad.
1396120	1400000	It's sad because that's what they're such a big company now that they can make those
1400000	1405120	deals and those deals ensure more people come to those stores and it screws everybody else
1405120	1410680	out and even sometimes they'll be like yeah we want to have the exclusive on that special
1410680	1415560	edition or whatever or they'll put out some other thing and it's all funded by the publishers
1415560	1419800	because the publishers will do whatever the fuck they want because they're the majority.
1419800	1423200	If they don't have the GameStop business they go under.
1423200	1426800	Yeah if your game's not a GameStop that's a huge coverage of distribution that you've
1426800	1427800	lost.
1427800	1432080	I have a comment in our chat room at chat.ornislandry.com Cajudo in chat says in GameStop's defense
1432080	1435420	Square Enix and OnLive were in the wrong on the coupon side.
1435420	1436760	Both parties were not in the right.
1436760	1440480	I actually agree with that and I do think Square Enix needed to apologize to GameStop
1440480	1443480	because that wasn't cool to include a competitor's coupon.
1443480	1447160	This is truly a case of though two wrongs don't make a right because who got hurt in
1447160	1448160	the end?
1448160	1449160	Did Square Enix get hurt?
1449160	1450280	Did GameStop get hurt?
1450280	1451280	No.
1451280	1452280	The buyers got hurt.
1452280	1456400	I don't really feel so bad for GameStop because their service is not live.
1456400	1457520	It's not done yet.
1457520	1458520	It's not even launched.
1458520	1459640	It's not even in a beta yet.
1459640	1464040	I don't feel bad for GameStop because they've been opening shit for years and reselling
1464040	1465040	it as new.
1465040	1467920	I understand that but I'm saying there's no reason they should have had to apologize to
1467920	1472080	them in the first place because it's like saying oh I'm gonna sell this at Walmart.
1472080	1475340	Walmart's like oh well we're gonna take the code out because we're gonna come out with
1475340	1477200	our own streaming service five years from now.
1477200	1481920	Oh well I'm sorry I didn't confirm with you to see if you have a streaming service coming.
1481920	1485680	I mean big fucking deal yeah you bought a company and you say it's coming out in the
1485680	1489120	spring of 2012 but is it really gonna come out then?
1489120	1494840	I mean this thing could be delayed till 2013 and really what?
1494840	1499880	First off, not that many people buy PC games in the first place and second off, not everybody's
1499880	1506860	gonna be using that coupon for the free game on OnLive so I just don't know.
1506860	1511000	If you're worried that your service is gonna be that much threatened by OnLive then you
1511000	1516880	better figure out some way to save yourselves because OnLive sure got a jump on you.
1516880	1519200	Alright I don't, go ahead.
1519200	1524120	They never, they didn't do this with Portal 2 which came with the Steam integration code.
1524120	1529440	But they don't have, well and actually that does make sense because it's, they're streaming,
1529440	1530440	they're talking about streaming.
1530440	1533720	See if there was some sort of streaming copy but that's, but they also have their digital
1533720	1537200	store that they do sell stuff in.
1537200	1542400	Anyhow all I gotta say is that as long as the consumer continues to give GameStop the
1542400	1545720	monopoly this shit's gonna happen but GameStop's scared because they're looking five years
1545720	1549760	ahead and I think they are a little worried and I think they should be to some extent.
1549760	1554160	You know stories like this aren't helping it's just pushing digital distribution up
1554160	1558440	faster and the life cycle of the GameStop store.
1558440	1564480	Think of it guys, GameStop is going to go the way of Blockbuster in five to ten years.
1564480	1565480	Think about it.
1565480	1568280	Digital distribution is never gonna, it doesn't matter.
1568280	1571720	Just because it's just another segment of the business that's not gonna take over the
1571720	1572720	business.
1572720	1576640	And the reason why is because people like physical copies of things.
1576640	1581040	Some things though people can get away with getting digitally like certain games they,
1581040	1582520	I don't care about that.
1582520	1587240	And actually it's kind of the publishers fault a little bit because nowadays hell they're
1587240	1590960	not even throwing manuals in there it's just a case with a disk in it and that's it.
1590960	1595400	Alright I wanna get to this week's news but let me do a couple more comments from our
1595400	1596400	chat room.
1596400	1598200	After all it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
1598200	1602920	SonicM88 in our chat at chat.orangelandtrader.com says I also have a good friend who works at
1602920	1605200	GameStop so I'm a little partial.
1605200	1606800	And that's in response to something you said earlier.
1606800	1608840	I go to GameStop for the knowledge.
1608840	1613200	Their employees always know the most about gaming.
1613200	1618760	And so yeah you know I think every store is different in that capacity it just kind of
1618760	1622900	depends and there are I mean like I said at the top my always my beef is GameStop has
1622900	1624920	never been the front line employees.
1624920	1626400	It's like any other business.
1626400	1629440	Some of them are jerks and I don't want to shop at those stores but there are some really
1629440	1633040	decent people who work at GameStop and that are very knowledgeable about games.
1633040	1638840	However the bonehead mistakes of management such as what occurred here is just gonna hurt
1638840	1641040	all those people and it's unfortunate.
1641040	1645340	And I understand that it's good to have knowledgeable staff at your stores but at the same time
1645340	1647880	the consumer needs to educate themselves on games.
1647880	1651520	I mean you don't go blindly into obviously if you're going into a game store you kind
1651520	1653040	of have an idea of what you want.
1653040	1657840	I mean and we're talking in a day and age where there's the Internet.
1657840	1663440	I mean if you want to educate yourself on any about people who come into game stores.
1663440	1666360	Does Dan want a mic?
1666360	1669440	People who come into game stores ninety percent of time don't know a dick about what they
1669440	1670440	want.
1670440	1671440	OK.
1671440	1672440	Nothing.
1672440	1674120	You know what you want when you go into a game store.
1674120	1676200	But that's because you're an ultra gamer.
1676200	1681780	Most people come in they're just like oh and they come to you and they're like tell me
1681780	1683400	what's good.
1683400	1685560	That's why there's a GameStop.
1685560	1690400	That's why GameStop even exists because you can't get that at Best Buy because ninety
1690400	1693880	six percent of people who work at Best Buy don't work in the game section and the two
1693880	1697560	that do are never fucking there.
1697560	1700840	The reason GameStop exists it's not that they sell the most games and again it's not like
1700840	1703000	they sell them the best.
1703000	1708640	It's just that they're the one store left in the fucking world that you walk into and
1708640	1718480	it's just all games all the time and if it's any store with a staff that's worth a fuck
1718480	1722680	everyone there knows about all the games.
1722680	1723680	Bring it back.
1723680	1724680	Bring it back motherfucker.
1724680	1725680	Do it!
1725680	1728920	Well then those type of people anyway should be shopping at Walmart anyways because they're
1728920	1735200	you know brainless drones that will just stumble right in to buy any game that you say is good.
1735200	1736200	Well right but exactly.
1736200	1737200	Yes!
1737200	1739600	They're not going to do the difference and all you have to do is educate yourself.
1739600	1742880	Hey well these people are stupid they're just going to buy whatever you tell them to and
1742880	1744160	they're like okay.
1744160	1745880	That's why GameStop exists.
1745880	1749120	That's why GameStop makes money and that's why GameStop is important because they've
1749120	1751500	got tremendous pull in the industry.
1751500	1756140	The people who go to Walmart are either just pointing and shooting and hoping for a good
1756140	1762360	game or it's someone like you who goes I ain't going to GameStop I'll just stop by Walmart
1762360	1767280	or Target and hope they have it on the shelf and just bag it.
1767280	1773480	But for the unwashed masses that's why you hope that you go to a specialty retailer with
1773480	1777200	a crew that knows about games.
1777200	1779920	And there's plenty of other specialty retailers out there.
1779920	1780920	Plan trade.
1780920	1782560	No no no no no.
1782560	1783560	Lots of indies.
1783560	1785640	Right right sure there's a couple.
1785640	1786640	Look at Sacramento.
1786640	1789500	How many plan trades do we have?
1789500	1790760	Do we even still have one?
1790760	1791760	Folsom's gone right?
1791760	1792760	Yeah Folsom's gone.
1792760	1795040	Okay and how many indies do we have?
1795040	1796040	Three?
1796040	1797560	A few.
1797560	1801940	You know there aren't many left and I think that's terrible because I loved independent
1801940	1802940	game stores.
1802940	1803940	Oh yeah.
1803940	1806320	That's the reason I ended up working at GameStop because I was going to use Funco Land at the
1806320	1809280	moment to teach myself to run an independent game store.
1809280	1814520	But the problem is is that you know the Akira wave hit and they just engulfed all the other
1814520	1820640	retailers and what killed GameStop was when they was when they got EB.
1820640	1826040	Because when they got EB there was no incentive to be a better company because they were the
1826040	1827280	fucking company.
1827280	1832560	And now they're only competing on an area where they're so concerned about oh the intangible
1832560	1834940	competition of this coupon.
1834940	1840440	Right OnLive was really really competing with GameStop's non-existent streaming service.
1840440	1841440	Good job guys.
1841440	1842920	Way to embrace the added value.
1842920	1846320	I'm sure all two dozen people who keep OnLive because of that coupon are going to never
1846320	1848440	go to GameStop again right?
1848440	1849440	Dipshits.
1849440	1854640	Of course let's also remember that like seven GameStops still sell any amount of PC games
1854640	1855640	anyway.
1855640	1856640	Fuck.
1856640	1857640	I'm done.
1857640	1861640	All right Dan's rant from the front lines.
1861640	1864000	He's been there in the front.
1864000	1868560	And I do think we need to also fairly you know in the chats there's some chatter in
1868560	1872140	our chat room fairly slap Square Enix on the wrist here too.
1872140	1874440	They are not without fault in this whole story.
1874440	1878360	Seriously Final Fantasy 14 what's going on?
1878360	1881760	It's really Final Fantasy 14's fault when all said and done but no seriously I mean
1881760	1882760	they do have a responsibility.
1882760	1888280	It was not cool of them to two days before springing on everybody including the retailers.
1888280	1891400	Oh by the way we're pushing OnLive in this.
1891400	1893600	You know that wasn't cool.
1893600	1899120	Uh you know I think it's cooler than you know say THQ going oh by the way we have this thing
1899120	1902480	where you have to buy the game new otherwise you got to pay ten dollars to play online
1902480	1907720	ha ha ha ha suckas.
1907720	1911680	By the way you need to be connected online all the time to play our game Ubisoft.
1911680	1913560	I agree and I agree all around.
1913560	1916680	I think we've given those companies fair razzings where they need to go.
1916680	1920240	I just want to say this on GameStop and then I swear we'll move into our gaming weeks and
1920240	1921240	so forth.
1921240	1924120	It's just like you know I still think the problem at the end of the day although I think
1924120	1928920	Dan does make a very good point that they're one of the few places left that's all about
1928920	1933080	the games and the completely clueless can at least kind of have an idea of a place where
1933080	1934080	to go.
1934080	1937540	I think even people like that when they hear about this in the mainstream media and it
1937540	1943180	was on CNN it was on CBS news dot com this was picked up by the mainstream media and
1943180	1947040	it's funny we have a story later tonight that's going to get into the lols about the local
1947040	1949840	news and how they can skew stories and so forth.
1949840	1955160	I think when they do this stuff and communicated to the masses the masses like oh GameStop's
1955160	1957800	ripping people off well I'm not going to go there anymore.
1957800	1963440	You know these people that are completely clueless about their games are also pretty
1963440	1967960	fickle and I think when they find out that there are other options available to them
1967960	1973840	you know this is this is a great opportunity for companies like Best Buy.
1973840	1977320	I think Target I'm trying to think of who's been trying to strengthen their gaming lately
1977320	1981720	I know we've heard the reports about the Best Buy's doing something and I think I want to
1981720	1985880	say there was a Target initiative too because they were doing buybacks to games and so forth.
1985880	1988800	In the end of the day this is going to work out really well for them.
1988800	1991440	It's about seizing this opportunity I think.
1991440	1997400	So anyhow I think Amazon don't they have new gaming stuff but Amazon's weird because they're
1997400	2001840	such a huge company but we never see them like they're just out and on the internet.
2001840	2006780	Well and I think if you listen to what Dana just said about people needing advice on like
2006780	2010960	what freaking games to buy I think that kind of answers the question as to why Amazon will
2010960	2013880	never be the only store.
2013880	2017520	It will always be an option for the people that know what they want for the people that
2017520	2019480	don't know what they want Amazon doesn't work.
2019480	2023720	And granted for the people that I would say listen to our show I mean I would hope that
2023720	2028600	a lot of them that are pretty knowledgeable of games that are coming out but if you're
2028600	2033320	not I mean there's message boards out there you know hey you know I'm interested in blah
2033320	2041640	blah blah blah blah you know what games would you recommend that I play.
2041640	2046400	Dan's yelling from the living room but we can't hear him so all right let's move on.
2046400	2049440	We talked like for a half hour about GameStop and that whole story last week I want to move
2049440	2050440	on.
2050440	2054480	Let's move on into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you have been playing.
2054480	2055480	Loki we'll start with you tonight.
2055480	2056480	So Star Stalker is not here.
2056480	2058060	How was your gaming week?
2058060	2059060	It was all right.
2059060	2060720	I still haven't been playing a whole lot of stuff.
2060720	2069800	I played a little bit more of VVVV and I have all the shiny objects except for one and it's
2069800	2073140	the probably one of the hardest ones to get.
2073140	2083320	It's four screens of dodging spikes and then you hit the top reverse and dodge four more
2083320	2088520	screens of spikes it makes you want to pull your hair out and I just said you know what
2088520	2092480	fuck it I know what I get for getting this I get the whole game upside down and I don't
2092480	2098320	give a fuck about playing this game again so that's it I'm done with that game and then
2098320	2102160	it's still a great game though it was a great game yes but and I understand it's supposed
2102160	2107240	to be really hard but it's just like I don't care I don't care it's like they're like ha
2107240	2114000	you have to go through four screens jump over this one little like ledge that yes I get
2114000	2117840	it my character can't jump but he can reverse gravity you think if you have the technology
2117840	2122560	to reverse gravity you can I don't know step over something but of course you know whatever
2122560	2128200	rules of the game so okay um but yeah I'm just not playing anymore because I don't care
2128200	2135680	to get to some secret laboratory or whatever that's got you know some bonus stuff I don't
2135680	2142440	care about whatever um played more Earth Defense Force inside Garmageddon I have my first character
2142440	2149440	leveled up to tier eight my tactical guy and I guess gotta start working on some of my
2149440	2161120	other characters like my trooper jet and was it battle so very fun game still and hopefully
2161120	2164920	gonna be playing a little bit more co-op on that because I haven't gotten a chance to
2164920	2171880	lately been playing lots of Grand Theft Auto still still fun still trying to win as many
2171880	2176680	games as possible so I can get my ranks up because I not playing for about six months
2176680	2183280	drop me about 30 30 ranks in the rank death match so that kind of pissed me off a little
2183280	2190720	bit but nothing really I could do there just a lot of people not necessarily beating me
2190720	2196620	but played less game so if they you know have a streak of 10 or whatever counts a lot more
2196620	2202840	than what I get I have to I'd have like a streak of 30 and if I lose one it's just going
2202840	2209360	back just as far so it sucks cuz I played so many games and then what else did I play
2209360	2219960	not much download my 3ds NES games so have those on my 3ds now so played them though
2219960	2234440	trying to play something else on the iPod now that's pretty much it all right so pop
2234440	2242320	how was your gaming week mostly World of Warcraft a lot of World of Warcraft at the Flint's
2242320	2249320	arcade at Disneyland I got to play our type in an actual stand-up machine just as hard
2249320	2254640	as it is on the Super NES and every other incarnation of our type that's ever existed
2254640	2261800	also the classic I think this even this may even predate Street Fighter 1 by Capcom which
2261800	2267000	was an awful game but Konami's I think it's kung-fu master if anyone remembers that game
2267000	2270520	you're the little guy in the little white g with the black belt does you mean you are
2270520	2275040	kung-fu or something like that isn't yeah it's a tsunami fighter and these you are kung-fu
2275040	2281960	and like the big like yeah and I think the very first villain or combatant is like this
2281960	2286480	big chunky dude bald-headed that that game I'm I used to play the hell out of that game
2286480	2290700	at the pizza parlor when I was in junior high because you know we all played video games
2290700	2295480	at pizza parlors back then so yeah those two games were what I focused on it at Flint's
2295480	2301040	arcade there wasn't a lot there that really you know struck stuck out to me if they had
2301040	2308080	they had gauntlet and a bunch of other stuff but I've been checking out the games on Google
2308080	2312520	Plus because they just got their gaming API added and I've been playing believe it or
2312520	2317520	not a game I've had a lot of disdain for the Apple Store playing it on the iPad going I
2317520	2322160	don't get this why is everyone losing their mind over this game angry birds I'm playing
2322160	2326760	it right now actually on Dark Sakura's machine why oh that's very appropriate for not being
2326760	2331760	here why why angry birds I don't understand the allure of this game why why is does America
2331760	2336880	have and I'm assuming the rest the world to this sick fascination with angry birds it's
2336880	2342780	boring I don't know I I I am with you I played it it was alright it's kind of neat you know
2342780	2349440	yeah it's a physic puzzler and you launch birds in the things you need I but I don't
2349440	2354280	I'm not obsessed about it I like it was like it was alright you know it's cheap iPod game
2354280	2359320	as far as these iPod games go I like cut the rope but I wouldn't buy the guy on a t-shirt
2359320	2363140	and I've literally like while I was at Disneyland I saw like a ton of angry birds t-shirts they're
2363140	2370160	making a fucking movie based on this why why oh I know why because Hollywood's really run
2370160	2376080	out of ideas I mean it's like let's make a game I don't know if it's in our show role
2376080	2383000	but we've able is making a movie based on some like a doom clone no I didn't make our
2383000	2386760	show role because I saw it label and I was like it's like some doom clone it's like you
2386760	2393480	would never know it you know I didn't realize this obscure game is it's basically excuse
2393480	2398280	for him to make a zombie movie he's like okay what games a zombie thing okay I'm gonna base
2398280	2404420	my movie on this all right but we're we're we're digressing so slices pop you're playing
2404420	2412600	angry birds right now justify yourself look at your life look at your choice I know it's
2412600	2417360	it really takes just no brainpower to play this game you have unlimited retries you just
2417360	2423640	fling birds at shit until you kill all the pigs that's the whole game I know I have no
2423640	2428160	room to talk and there's a game I've been playing this didn't hit the pig when I aimed
2428160	2433600	it high so let's name it no and try it again no I did it and then like you're you know
2433600	2436880	it's now 3 in the morning and your iPhone is out of battery life I don't know I don't
2436880	2442560	get it but yeah I'm that and also I need to look up the name of it there for those
2442560	2450120	listening who enjoy bust a move or puzzle bobble it is as it is more appropriately called
2450120	2459400	there is a clone of that game on Google Plus called a ripoff of worms right there I'm not
2459400	2464960	sure but at the monkeys in it it was that monster world that character looked hideous
2464960	2470760	that was like a that was like a divine but not like a like Charlie the tuna dressed in
2470760	2475760	drag what was that like a monster world or something like that forget it it's called
2475760	2480360	for it's called bubble island and there's this little raccoon and he's like it plays
2480360	2484920	exactly like puzzle bobble bust a move so if you like like those games and have Google
2484920	2489420	Plus and you want to you can't really spam the shit out of people on Google Plus and
2489420	2493580	also Facebook has copied that format it all goes to a totally separate tab if you want
2493580	2497560	to support indie art or indie developers all they can do is make fucking clones of really
2497560	2502500	awesome games just you know the cash in then go right ahead is that iPhone developer game
2502500	2506400	loft or whatever they they thrive on ripping games off and they do it really well yeah
2506400	2510500	but that's that's the thing they do it really well I mean and to the point they fucking
2510500	2516880	got wow on an iPhone it's pretty pretty amazing I gotta say it's sad it's like you know it
2516880	2522160	would be like having Spielberg doing remakes of something we have we have some Angry Birds
2522160	2527000	defenders in our chat room at chat.com and every gamer does get a voice here act-def
2527000	2531640	says Angry Birds is fun not the best game ever Izzam says Angry Birds is just something
2531640	2535640	you can let your mind go numb on and waste time with Kaijuto says Angry Birds is the
2535640	2540840	best we all love to knock down stuff act-def says Angry Birds is fun because of the cute
2540840	2544840	destruction it happens in the game it's also like a puzzler so people like to knock things
2544840	2551080	over yeah I guess that's the allure of Jenga I don't know all right so Angry Birds fine
2551080	2557520	anything else Angry Birds wow the two games at Flynn's arcade and that oh um I play your
2557520	2565000	3ds when you're at work and I'm bored so what games on 3ds uh Metroid Ice Climbers uh Zelda
2565000	2568260	2 oh the ambassador games yeah the master were you kind of doing that thing where you'd
2568260	2571560	play them for five minutes and you go yep it's Zelda and then switch to another game
2571560	2580760	yeah do you feel yourself needing to yell at Zelda 2 so why is this game so damn annoying
2580760	2585360	and games like that were easier when I was nine I don't know look look look there it
2585360	2590120	is like that it's not did you see that character like what the hell was that was that called
2590120	2596320	Monster Island it was like Charlie the Tuna in drag all right um all right so I guess
2596320	2600280	that's it for your yeah see wild ones that is a fucking ripoff right yeah that looks
2600280	2606000	like a worm it's a panda bear with a gun how could that game not be good all right moving
2606000	2610040	on I want to talk about my gaming week of which actually since you know I was out of
2610040	2614120	town I don't have a whole lot to talk about Flynn's arcade I played Frogger I don't know
2614120	2618880	why much much to Loki's dismay I love to play old school Frogger in an actual don't get
2618880	2622880	me wrong old school Frogger is cool I just don't see the need of the constant remakes
2622880	2626440	of Frogger I'm with you there because they weren't good and I played Donkey Kong Junior
2626440	2629800	like I've just been I don't know like I wanted to play that in the arcade hella bad and then
2629800	2633160	finally you could download that on your I know ironically enough that ended up being
2633160	2637480	one of the 3ds ambassador games and I played it there too and one of my whole like fun
2637480	2641280	it but it's funny I played it not even a day after I played the arcade version and I could
2641280	2644600	really see the difference like right away not like graphically but just in how the game
2644600	2648800	was a little easier on the NES than it was in the arcade that's for sure but that's you
2648800	2654480	can't like if you fall even a little bit from one platform to a platform that's underneath
2654480	2660680	you you die yeah you can't there's no yeah has to be you can do like a slight fall but
2660680	2664200	not not because I'm thinking it's like Mario where if it's not a pit where it just goes
2664200	2669240	off the bottom of the screen you can just jump down there no you're you die no yeah
2669240	2674000	so been playing some 3ds ambassador games as well played Metroid probably the longest
2674000	2678520	out of them all actually played Metroid for a little bit so that was kind of fun I do
2678520	2683240	loves me some Metroid and as far as other real games go I'll tell you what the game
2683240	2688680	that ate up the most of my time that wasn't wow was Civilization 5 I played an epic multiplayer
2688680	2693560	Civ 5 match over the weekend it went on for six hours me and two of my friends from the
2693560	2698600	Bay Area started up a game at 8 o'clock on Friday night and it was like 2 15 in the morning
2698600	2703960	and we were like oh my god it's like after one we should probably like go to bed so we
2703960	2707280	need to save the game and I don't even know if we're gonna be able to recover from the
2707280	2712140	save because like I couldn't save the game only the host could save the game so I really
2712140	2716640	hope we are able to restore from that save gamer it's gonna be very sad but at the same
2716640	2720340	time it was a lot of fun and just goes to show how freaking addicting that game was
2720340	2726160	but it was it was neat like I found that my two friends are very expansionistic whereas
2726160	2731120	I'm more about get five cities and make them just fucking fortresses and build them up
2731120	2735120	as best you can it's the year you know 1700 and they have laser beam technology or whatever
2735120	2739320	yeah actually yeah we had riflemen in the year 1500 we had to end the game around like
2739320	2743180	1600 of course we were on kind of dumb dumb difficulty because we didn't want the computer
2743180	2749560	to kick our ass too much so I don't know I just I love Civilization and the Civilization
2749560	2754840	series and Civ 5 is my favorite since the original so nothing will ever top the original
2754840	2761000	to me because I'm just stuck up that way but Civ 5 is pretty freaking great and I'm having
2761000	2765080	a lot of fun playing that online and I want to like do that again any iPhone games you've
2765080	2771800	been playing um tiny tower which whatever shut up don't don't taunt me I will say this
2771800	2777640	I've also been I besides Civ 5 and stuff and light light console stuff here and there keep
2777640	2782140	in mind guys my Xbox is still out of commission remember the hack it's been three weeks I
2782140	2787320	need to call Xbox tomorrow where's my money if they're even open it's Labor Day I don't
2787320	2792000	know so I only really have a ps3 and I was gone for most of the weeks that's why my gaming
2792000	2797240	week was a little bit sad but I will say this on Facebook speaking of sad I've got sucked
2797240	2803800	into sim social hanging my head in shame allowing I'm shaking my head in shame I know smh smh
2803800	2810640	it's just it's I will say this it's a pretty darn good ripoff of the sims and you know
2810640	2815120	I think everybody got addicted to the sims at some point not like there's definitely
2815120	2819480	varying levels of difficulty but okay why are you giving a big thumbs down slash spot
2819480	2825240	it was like a year maybe even two years after the sims one which came out what 2000 2001
2825240	2830880	came out it it had beaten mist as like the top selling pc game ever I played it for a
2830880	2835920	weekend I did not get it I thought it was so boring and I have not looked at the sims
2835920	2841320	franchise since and that was 10 years ago wow no I just I don't think people get sucked
2841320	2847520	into it like Jamie level Jamie plays a lot of sims but you know I played the first one
2847520	2850580	for a couple weeks and thought it was a lot of fun and you know kind of got sucked into
2850580	2855160	it and the lives of my little sims and now they have it on Facebook and of course here's
2855160	2861360	the thing I think they've done a good job of translating the sims into a Facebook game
2861360	2864880	even though the whole energy thing is very limiting but what can you do the game's free
2864880	2868980	you know there's got to be some limits but here's the thing I think sim social is also
2868980	2874560	like everything you fucking hate about a Facebook game is in this game like the spam on people's
2874560	2880540	walls and ask all your friends for a cookie or whatever and all this stuff like it's just
2880540	2886320	bullshit like how much this game fucks up your Facebook wall and this is why people
2886320	2892360	hate Facebook games like I really want sim social to be on Google Plus because I don't
2892360	2896480	think it will be because it can't be as invasive on Google Plus you're grinning over there
2896480	2901760	salacious pop yeah I have I have not added sim social to my Facebook in any way so it's
2901760	2906180	I don't technically have it installed or whatever it's called but if I go to my games tab on
2906180	2910680	Facebook there's at least 10 people that I know very well in real life that are like
2910680	2915000	join sim social and send me a little fluffy pillow because I'm trying to renovate my living
2915000	2919200	room and I need it for my couch send me a pillow and I just want to say like no I'll
2919200	2924680	send you fire to burn down your goddamn house stop bothering me they actually do have fury
2924680	2931640	anyway but yeah this is why people hate Facebook games it is the fastest growing game since
2931640	2936560	Farmville though it's the biggest it's going to be the biggest Facebook game since Farmville
2936560	2940560	I guarantee you don't you have to like mow your lawn to earn points yeah you can crop
2940560	2943320	all the grass and you have to you have to do that like if you don't want to actually
2943320	2946800	take care of your real lawn in real life you can mow your digital lawn well it's just like
2946800	2952200	okay not to get too tangeny too late but we went to go visit my mother this week because
2952200	2955440	it was my dad's birthday and you know my mother's a very animated character and she was talking
2955440	2958900	about her friend that plays Farmville right and what was she telling us about her friend
2958900	2962960	like her friend is afraid to leave the house she was going on vacation and she had to give
2962960	2967920	her daughter because I think this was a retired aged woman had to give her a 70 year old woman
2967920	2972080	had to get her 71 had to give her grown daughter her Facebook password so that her daughter
2972080	2976580	could log in once or twice a day to click on all of the farm to feed her chickens to
2976580	2981920	feed the chicken or they might die yeah she didn't want her farm to lose the progression
2981920	2988180	of points when she was on chickens yeah Farmville chickens I mean that's like what these games
2988180	2993340	have become to some people and if the chickens ever do die she could just take out a credit
2993340	2997800	card and buy five dollars worth of Zinga bucks and just respawn her chickens that's how they
2997800	3005060	make money yeah taking advantage of I'm very I'm very proud of my mother for not getting
3005060	3009140	sucked into all that she does she always she's very staunch I'm not getting on Facebook no
3009140	3014980	one wants to see my face but I don't know if I should say this on the show but she she
3014980	3022780	got she's on don't ask do not ask me she's on Twitter she got a Twitter account and she
3022780	3027440	asked me how to upload her picture to her Twitter account and she's following like Rosie
3027440	3032920	and and what share and stuff on Twitter and it's really cute but yeah she doesn't want
3032920	3036600	me I told her I would plug her Twitter and would get her some followers but she doesn't
3036600	3040100	want it she doesn't she she gets creeped out by people following so don't try to find her
3040100	3044800	guys she doesn't want to be found so but she's she's on there and it's really really funny
3044800	3050100	so I'm proud of my mother for finally embracing technology because for the longest time she
3050100	3053340	was one of those people that thought the CD-ROM drive was a coaster why are you paying two
3053340	3060140	hundred bucks for the coaster so anyway let's move on then that's it for our gaming weeks

3077800	3084160	on Twitter so I guess that's it let's get into this week's gaming news after plenty
3084160	3087380	of talk of last week's news and our antics this week let's finally talk about what's
3087380	3094020	going on this week Loki this weekend was the call of duty XP event in LA it was kind of
3094020	3100500	their call of duty con if you will where they were talking about the new elite service and
3100500	3107700	also the hardened edition of modern warfare 3 so the first thing we're going to talk about
3107700	3112540	real quick is the hardened edition which thankfully this year it is only one special edition no
3112540	3118700	prestige this time around no RC car that's way overpriced or some cheap ass night vision
3118700	3126340	goggles that really are just some toys this time you get basically the game plus is a
3126340	3133580	field guide that it's over a hundred pages some avatar clothes or did you know animated
3133580	3140700	theme if you're on a PlayStation Network also one year of call of duty elite membership
3140700	3151100	which is apparently a $50 value and all that's gonna run you 80 bucks and I have to say you
3151100	3159300	know I did watch the least a part of their streaming coverage of the one they're talking
3159300	3164620	about the multiplayer and the elite service and I gotta say man they they really have
3164620	3169980	got their shit together as far as how to do an online community and how to give the fans
3169980	3175020	what they want for that it's it's kind of interesting because like you know what they're
3175020	3179980	not going to do too bad without infinity Ward I mean the old infinity Ward there's still
3179980	3184780	infinity Ward but in the game out but it's not all the old people from infinity Ward
3184780	3188700	but they got their shit together as far as online community and that's really what's
3188700	3193180	going to stand them apart from battlefield 3 elaborate a little more like why why is
3193180	3198140	it so awesome well there's a bunch of stuff to the offer for free and it's all on this
3198140	3204180	basically you can create clans you can you can it links in with Facebook you can find
3204180	3211460	your friends on Facebook and build to play games with them you can join up groups that
3211460	3216660	are necessarily like say for example I'm a fan of the Giants or something like that I
3216660	3220420	can play with other Call of Duty players that are fans of you know the San Francisco Giants
3220420	3228180	or whatever so nothing I'm a Giants fan I hate sports but they have that kind of stuff
3228180	3235060	they have where you can break down you can see what other players loadouts are like say
3235060	3239620	for example you you know playing against somebody and somebody kills you and you can see you
3239620	3243380	know you can pull up all this information all the hotspots on the map you can see what
3243380	3247480	their loadout was you can try their loadout if you want you can create your own game modes
3247480	3251380	you can upload those share them with friends they can tweak them they can you share them
3251380	3260300	back again you can capture 30-second clips and post them up in HD to share with friends
3260300	3267820	you can compete in tournaments you know for real prizes that of course that's the paid
3267820	3272800	service and they're gonna have different tournaments based on people's skill levels so it's not
3272800	3280580	gonna be just all you know crazy Call of Duty elite players and stuff like that they also
3280580	3287540	with the elite service you're gonna be able to get all the download content for for free
3287540	3291860	and you're gonna be able to get it first so they're gonna put out download content every
3291860	3295620	month instead of every quarter like they normally do everybody else you know that's not paying
3295620	3299660	for the elite service or doesn't buy the hardened edition you have to pay for that separately
3299660	3306580	and that's 60 bucks if you were to buy all that on top of you know the membership or
3306580	3312020	without the membership I guess so lots of it just is interesting and lots of different
3312020	3317220	you know game modes and basically just kind of they retweet you know their whole perk
3317220	3322220	system and stuff like that and it just sounded interesting for someone that I'm not really
3322220	3326420	into the series at all I mean it's just for me it feels like if I hadn't been playing
3326420	3330820	the first one and haven't been playing solid like you know like I do with Grand Theft Auto
3330820	3336420	I'm don't really feel comfortable playing Modern Warfare 3 you know I probably could
3336420	3342300	it's just you know some of those players play you know Call of Duty like I played Grand
3342300	3345980	Theft Auto so yeah DDR Dalla Billinor Chatham is with you I'm just not interested in the
3345980	3349800	Call of Duty series so you know and I'm not really into those games as well but I can
3349800	3355340	also see I recognize that they're huge games in the industry and that more importantly
3355340	3360060	where this succeeds other games might follow do you see something like this coming to other
3360060	3365220	games I hope so I would love this for like Grand Theft Auto it would be awesome there's
3365220	3368540	not that many people that play Grand Theft Auto multiplayer which I hope changes with
3368540	3375860	the next one but you know whenever that may be sooner than you think I think next year
3375860	3380580	for sure but I mean it would be great I would love that kind of stuff and they kind of had
3380580	3384900	something sort of like that with the whole social club with Rockstar Games and stuff
3384900	3388860	but it's not really in game it's more of just you go to a website and you can interact all
3388860	3394160	the stuff whereas this is actually in the game you can do all that before with Black
3394160	3400100	Ops I guess you could do that on the website but now it's actually in the game and you
3400100	3407000	can do everything you can on the website which is pretty awesome so yeah I hope I hope they
3407000	3412420	do that and I mean if it as long as it delivers on what they say because honestly prior to
3412420	3415980	this information I would have said Battlefield 3 is probably gonna be the better game and
3415980	3422060	I still think you know they're two different types of games but I mean it looks Battlefield
3422060	3427940	3 looks really good so if they have you know some decent multiplayer you know community
3427940	3432540	features and stuff like that it still might be you know a toss-up between the two but
3432540	3437020	don't you think most people just end up with both probably you know what and there's nothing
3437020	3441100	wrong with that you don't have to draw you know pick sides or anything I mean this isn't
3441100	3444760	a competition it's just it's a competition between develop or you know publishers and
3444760	3449140	developers and stuff but when the players come involved it just whatever buy what you
3449140	3456380	want I mean this is you don't have to make a choice it's whatever so some other things
3456380	3461540	they talked about go with the elite stuff real quick mobile apps they're gonna be putting
3461540	3464980	out some mobile apps so you could check out what your friends are doing and make all those
3464980	3472020	tweaks and stuff on your iPod or iPhone or your Android or whatever PC so they're gonna
3472020	3482940	have that as well other fun stuff let's see here's the basically the bonuses that they're
3482940	3487100	gonna offer customers the first subscribers will get a year's worth of download content
3487100	3491420	for modern warfare 3 and they're saying it's over 20 pieces of content and they're gonna
3491420	3496420	be putting out monthly content drops instead of quarterly and they'll include new maps
3496420	3501560	new game modes with you know the value being 60 bucks elite subscribers will have access
3501560	3506720	to daily and weekly competitions and events which will offer both real and virtual prizes
3506720	3511660	subscribers will be able to level up their clans in competition so that's kind of cool
3511660	3518300	and and also see they'll have eight times more video sharing capacity than standard
3518300	3523540	users they'll have access to expert strategy and analysis including tips on guns maps perks
3523540	3528040	whatever that was one of the other things I kind of liked is you can level up your preferences
3528040	3533540	on different weapons so instead of just leveling up your character if I use like a p90 all
3533540	3539260	the time I would get skills you know be able to put scopes on it or whatever you know different
3539260	3545820	modifications which is kind of cool they're gonna have elite TV which is this like premium
3545820	3553540	service thing it's gonna have different different like shows I guess like Friday night fights
3553540	3558020	which they're gonna I guess it's being produced by Ridley and Tony Scott and they're gonna
3558020	3562580	put like different rivals like okay they're this one week is gonna be like Democrats versus
3562580	3565700	Republicans or something like that and so you can watch the games play out and that
3565700	3571600	kind of stuff they're gonna have noob tube I guess which is some clips or whatever that
3571600	3578300	are gonna be kind of they're gonna have people making commentary on them including Will Arnett
3578300	3582860	and Jason Bateman they're gonna be smack targeting over I guess user created videos from the
3582860	3588140	game so I mean that's kind of cool and that's definitely unique content I would say but
3588140	3592800	you know is it for everybody you know is it for like someone that you know like me that's
3592800	3596620	not really in the call do you serious yeah probably not but it's it's definitely some
3596620	3599820	stuff to kind of go hey that's kind of you know I'll have to check that out and a lot
3599820	3604180	of this stuff was for free you know you don't have to buy into the subscription there's
3604180	3608880	a lot of that stuff that's already available for free and if you want that additional stuff
3608880	3613420	later on you can buy into it I guess or buy the hardened edition you get all that for
3613420	3617620	free and then finally the announced of course you know with a big game like that they're
3617620	3624660	gonna be doing an exclusive Xbox 360 bundle it's gonna come with a modern warfare 3 branded
3624660	3632540	console and couple controllers 320 gigabyte hard drive also custom startup and loading
3632540	3641060	disk sounds and that'll be I guess they're also gonna say those controllers are also
3641060	3646260	available separately for 60 bucks and they're gonna be doing a new headset which is also
3646260	3653260	coming out non-branded modern warfare 3 for 70 bucks that also is a Bluetooth headset
3653260	3659420	and those are the new Microsoft headsets now be coming out for $3.99 probably around the
3659420	3665620	same time as this the system. Interesting comment on our chat on chat.org.com ddrdollarbill
3665620	3671300	says should this shit really be taken that seriously and cyberbeast says to some people
3671300	3675020	yeah and I'm kind of inclined to agree with cyberbeast because I think I think everybody's
3675020	3680780	kind of got their thing even in gaming you know like I'm sure some folks paid an insane
3680780	3685980	amount of money to import those plastic instruments from Japan and the Bomani games that came
3685980	3690500	with that or a World of Warcraft game comes out in a limited edition that has you know
3690500	3694660	the uber book and soundtrack and all that stuff and people sign up for that and they
3694660	3699940	have premium services as well I mean I think either you have your thing or none of it's
3699940	3705840	really interesting to you you play a variety of games and like I said the $50 a year may
3705840	3710300	not be your thing especially if you're already paying for live you know that's already money
3710300	3715500	out of your pocket but a lot of the services on there are free so I mean check out at least
3715500	3719700	a free portion of it because why not I mean if you're playing it it sounds like it'd be
3719700	3725460	a good value but I don't really think a lot of people need expert tips or need to watch
3725460	3731660	Will Arnett make fun of videos I mean no one really needs that right and the download content
3731660	3735420	bonus is kind of cool because you're saving some money if you're planning on buying all
3735420	3741220	the download content I mean they're just trying to make money on the digital end because they're
3741220	3744620	making a lot of money on the digital side and then once again you know the the only
3744620	3748860	thing that kind of leaves a sour taste in my mouth would be you know the fact that this
3748860	3758500	company puts it out as Activision so yeah it's like yeah I really want to support Activision
3758500	3762800	I will say that you know again I'm not really into the series but I'm looking at the screenshot
3762800	3768660	of the you know hardened edition that is a lot of crap for a game that's a lot of crap
3768660	3772260	but I guess if I was really into this series I'd probably buy it I don't know if there's
3772260	3776460	a limited edition for Skyrim I'm probably gonna get it you know we all have our things
3776460	3780940	yeah there is it comes with the map they actually sign me up there's actually is kind of funny
3780940	3787780	the limited edition for Lord of the Rings war north comes with a an arrow quiver a leather
3787780	3793300	quiver wow that's awesome also of note it sounds like this Call of Duty Expo thing was
3793300	3797500	kind of a success for them too oh yeah I think so I definitely will be doing next year so
3797500	3800260	very interesting whatever the next game is all right well let's shift gears a little
3800260	3804140	bit and talk about Nintendo they are doing an event of their own now you know Tokyo doesn't
3804140	3808740	or excuse me Nintendo does not usually participate in the Tokyo game show hey they don't usually
3808740	3813220	go and this that's no new news they're not going this year either but they are going
3813220	3817660	to be doing a special press conference it's gonna take place on September 13th and that's
3817660	3821780	two days before the Tokyo game show now some folks are kind of reacting to this with what
3821780	3828020	could it be this could be a new 3ds maybe because there's always there's that rumor
3828020	3831180	going around right now that there's that 3ds is supposed to have a second analog stick
3831180	3838020	and all that stuff to which I say no no no that can't be true I mean it might be true
3838020	3841740	Nintendo's always working on something all the game companies are working on something
3841740	3847260	you bet you you bet your ass Sony's I station for it even though they're not sure that's
3847260	3850980	gonna piss off a lot of people and you think you think that price drop pissed off a lot
3850980	3856460	of people putting out a new system with six months you know with the holidays still to
3856460	3861460	come I have no doubt Nintendo is working on the next 3ds model for 2012 or 2013 they're
3861460	3865540	not gonna be okay let me put take it from the like the PSP they're not gonna add another
3865540	3868900	second analog sick because now you're gonna have games they're only gonna work on the
3868900	3873740	one system and not the old 3ds well there was talk about at having an add-on that would
3873740	3876860	plug it I don't know how it would work but it would plug into the existing DS and give
3876860	3881280	you the extra analog stick it could work it could work I could see how they could do it
3881280	3884160	you could plug something into the back of there like what the charger usually goes and
3884160	3888820	kind of have it reach what you're grinning that reminds me of the logitech rumor that
3888820	3895860	they were making a UMD accessory for the PlayStation go it's kind of funny huh it's I'm grinning
3895860	3899460	cuz it reminded me that story here's the thing I think people are freaking out Nintendo doing
3899460	3903720	a press conference before Tokyo game show is nothing new they do this all the time because
3903720	3906940	they don't participate in Tokyo game show and what does Nintendo have going for them
3906940	3910640	right now I already told you they're not gonna show the Wii U again I bet you that wasn't
3910640	3914380	at PAX was it that's one I don't think so that's one thing I did call right they didn't
3914380	3917620	show the Wii U at PAX something this show they don't have anything it's like a proof
3917620	3923260	of concept still yeah exactly it's too soon so they're not showing it now either and they're
3923260	3926020	not taking it Tokyo game show and it's not this so what else does Nintendo have going
3926020	3931220	on right now the 3ds so this is probably where they're going to announce what we have to
3931220	3936120	look forward to in 2012 whatever that might be I don't know it's probably too early to
3936120	3943500	say so but I don't think a redo of the 3ds is one of them now if here's what I am here's
3943500	3948980	what they could do is if it's true that they're going that direction they could announce the
3948980	3954840	plug at this Tokyo like whatever plug is going to give you that second analog stick they
3954840	3959460	could announce that and if that's announced then you fucking know what a new systems coming
3959460	3964340	out in 2012 but I just my gut tells me no I think they still have to really prove this
3964340	3969200	for you know it's kind of like one of those they've they've put it out there they need
3969200	3975500	to stand behind it it's not good why why why would you do that because that's basically
3975500	3979540	saying you know what we fucked up we should have put a second analog stick on there no
3979540	3984500	you can't do that six months out you know you just say you know what damn it you know
3984500	3988260	we should have put a second analog stick on it well our next console is going to have
3988260	3994860	to have one you know it people will live I mean the PSP did just fine one analog stick
3994860	4000420	granted it's suck you know that they're you know some games have to use the buttons to
4000420	4006380	have a second analog stick but you know what we can use the touchpad as much as I hate
4006380	4010780	doing it as a second analog stick or just make games that don't require a second analog
4010780	4016860	stick gripper oh one in our chat room says pretty assuredly he's she he says it's a mother
4016860	4023220	collection for the 3ds hi I wish my friend I don't think so yeah yeah they're gonna be
4023220	4029720	announcing that also it's gonna be bundled with last story and you know I I would say
4029720	4033940	so they're probably just gonna like focus on Kingdom Hearts maybe give a date for Kid
4033940	4038900	Icarus and some of the stuff we already know about and maybe like a new Nintendo we have
4038900	4044380	it there right now are no dates for Kid Icarus and the two Mario games well then maybe that's
4044380	4047380	what we're gonna hear we're gonna get some dates finally I think that's what you're gonna
4047380	4052820	get out of this and maybe a teaser of some Nintendo franchise coming back on the DS in
4052820	4057360	2012 I would think like zero the fanboy in me really wants to say f-zero but not with
4057360	4062320	Mario Kart still not out fan f-zero is still a ways out Pikmin seems like a pretty logical
4062320	4068340	choice some type of Pikmin game or like a Donkey Kong on the on the 3ds they those seem
4068340	4075860	like very logical candidates especially Pikmin Actraiser 3 he's trying to do to me don't
4075860	4084140	troll me all right other speaking of we screwed up so forth the ambassador program some more
4084140	4087140	details came out on that we kind of referenced it at the top of the show but if you didn't
4087140	4091220	hear the free Nintendo games are now available to those that bought the 3ds they came out
4091220	4094740	a little early actually they came out the night before they were supposed to and I think
4094740	4100260	that's because it was the first in Japan it was like the you know the 31st of August here
4100260	4105140	and the full list of games that you can get for free NES games Super Mario Brothers Donkey
4105140	4111020	Kong jr. balloon fight ice climber Legend of Zelda Metroid NES open tournament golf
4111020	4116940	wrecking crew Yoshi and Zelda to the adventure of link those are the games that came out
4116940	4121780	Yoshi by the way is not Yoshi's cookie it but it's a different puzzler it's it's kind
4121780	4125820	of crap it's the one where Mario was on the bottom and you can flip the things around
4125820	4130180	and you line up the characters and a little Yoshi eggs it's bad I played it I was like
4130180	4134580	oh this was not a good puzzler game they kept trying to it's like they had really good success
4134580	4138980	with Tetris and then dr. Mario isn't it a columns clone and columns isn't very good
4138980	4144760	either I guess it's kind of like columns but not really Mario's at the bottom and he flips
4144760	4147900	these platters around and that's that's what you're doing but I don't know I don't want
4147900	4150340	to talk too much about Yoshi it's not worth your time they really should have just done
4150340	4156140	dr. Mario see ya but you have five I would say in that list you have like five epic Nintendo
4156140	4163980	games Mario Brothers Zelda Zelda to Metroid and out of Donkey Kong jr. balloon fight an
4163980	4168620	ice climber probably one of those you go that's epic too is something that speaks to your
4168620	4175980	interest and then the rest of those stinkers but you know whatever again but whatever I
4175980	4179860	don't think I still I still to this day say Nintendo really didn't have to do anything
4179860	4185320	yeah so for them I mean when you early adopt this is the risk you take and so I think it's
4185320	4188900	neat that the games are out and that I didn't have to pay for them and I look forward to
4188900	4192780	the advanced games as well but having metroid in my pocket is kind of rad not gonna lie
4192780	4198000	it's kind of nice so looking forward to seeing how that multiplayer and all that stuff pulls
4198000	4201020	out because it might make a game like ice climber way more fun to be able to like actually
4201020	4203660	play that are they adding that later on I think so they were supposed to be doing that
4203660	4208380	for the NES like same room multiplayer but no longer with the cords that you had on the
4208380	4213740	Gameboy old school and all that and then of course as I already mentioned there are rumors
4213740	4219340	about a redesigned 3ds it's coming from a French website 01.net and normally you would
4219340	4223780	write that off as oh well who cares it's just some website to know what they're talking
4223780	4228780	about however I believe this is the same website that talked about what else did they blow
4228780	4233580	the lid on before they broke the Wii U and they broke the PS Vita and those specs so
4233580	4238380	it's kind of one of those they were right on these so take this early this but that's
4238380	4243460	where the whole rumor of the second stick comes from this the second analog stick rumor
4243460	4249620	for the PSP original plague to that console for years and years and eventually there were
4249620	4253460	leaked photos of what if they were all fake I can see him doing if they want to do like
4253460	4257980	an Excel or something like that that doesn't piss me off big deal so it has a larger screen
4257980	4262940	you know I'll I'll get over that but you know the change it so much to where oh we're gonna
4262940	4268460	play a second analog so come on that's that's gonna piss people off yeah it's like the expression
4268460	4273740	you've made your bed now lie in it you know Final Fantasy 14 and they're not just coming
4273740	4278500	out with a new game yeah I mean it's just like well shouldn't this been part of the
4278500	4283180	it's just like it's not as bad as like Wii motion plus or something like that but it
4283180	4287220	is pretty bad it's like yeah we really should have had these extra sensors in there but
4287220	4291900	we want to drop the crap you know the cost of this but now we're just like yeah we're
4291900	4296580	gonna fuck you guys so um what made him change their mind though if this is true I still
4296580	4302060	I mean I realize this website has a record and so forth you know people have said the
4302060	4305820	same thing about us like why believe them when we were right on something early but
4305820	4310340	um I don't know I there's still a big grain of salt I'm taking this with but I feel like
4310340	4315100	well why would they suddenly change their mind maybe it's developer pressure maybe because
4315100	4319380	the lack of games you know there's been a lack of games in the beginning here maybe
4319380	4323540	it's because they're worried that they're not gonna be able to you know port the hardcore
4323540	4327220	games over like some of these first person shooters or whatever the you know like a Call
4327220	4332700	of Duty you know Modern Warfare 3 is not gonna be able to be on that because we're not gonna
4332700	4337900	be sitting here after Christmas going there's a lack of games on the 3DS how could you be
4337900	4342980	you have Mario Kart Mario Kid Icarus all coming out by the end of the year and a bunch of
4342980	4347100	third party stuff those are pretty strong games and it's gonna be enough for the 3DS
4347100	4350620	granted it should have been what the system launched with but whatever 3DS is gonna be
4350620	4354980	in a much better position come December than it is currently you know what I mean like
4354980	4358660	it's like I feel like this whole like there's no games for 3DS that's that arguments gonna
4358660	4364980	get old at the end of the year and it's gonna be difficult to you know I wouldn't think
4364980	4370140	that they would announce like a revision to their system right before the holiday yeah
4370140	4374180	what that would be shooting yourself in the foot for real that would be just dumb of them
4374180	4379740	to do but again like I said a minute ago they could be working on that and this French website
4379740	4383940	might be right but that doesn't mean that's what they're announcing before the Tokyo Game
4383940	4387700	Show Nintendo always does a press conference before the Tokyo Game Show because they don't
4387700	4393820	participate I'll tell you what they're doing they're doing some sort of bundle it's like
4393820	4399180	oh look it's a Mario console with Mario okay yeah that makes sense I'm with you yeah absolutely
4399180	4404260	did they already announce something like that really and that's a red console but yeah I
4404260	4408540	bundle makes sense perfect sense and I think I think there will be a tease of a new game
4408540	4414660	in 2012 yeah we still have that Smash Brothers game and I want to play and this is weird
4414660	4419900	I want to play that Lego City stories because that is fucking Grand Theft Auto I recognize
4419900	4423940	Grand Theft Auto I played enough Grand Theft Auto to know what Grand Theft Auto is and
4423940	4428220	that's fucking Grand Theft Auto and it also has the same moniker as the PSP Grand Theft
4428220	4432300	Autos hold on a minute you don't care that it's Lego though and it's made by rockstar
4432300	4438060	games I'll play that shit all right fair enough by the way we have some comments in our chat
4438060	4444020	room going back to talking about the games that were in the ambassador pack let's see
4444020	4449660	balloon fight act F says balloon fight is awesome and Sonic m88 says I love balloon
4449660	4453780	fight and orange right says balloon fight is only good for balloon trips there's there's
4453780	4458460	a lot of love for balloon fight in the chat and some some some in the middle of the road
4458460	4463020	but yeah balloon fight if you never played it is basically Nintendo's joust ripoff you
4463020	4466900	know joust the game where you you'll flap a little birdie it's like that but with balloons
4466900	4471200	but yeah what made the game stand out was that it had this mode called balloon trip
4471200	4478020	where now imagine joust as a side scrolling game that's what balloon trip is except it
4478020	4482920	scrolls the wrong way too which is interesting it scrolls the other way but I think it's
4482920	4492100	I think it's neat so all right so let's move on with some more news so I should pop a former
4492100	4498300	take to interactive employee is suing them and is also trying to scrape up some other
4498300	4504260	people that might have the same grievances as him for a class action suit is suing them
4504260	4511540	for unpaid wages when he was a employee in their quality assurance department which is
4511540	4518820	based in California and basically saying he worked overtime didn't get paid for it doesn't
4518820	4523640	really say how he left the firm whether if he was laid off fired or quit but he says
4523640	4529740	that there's a lot of unpaid wages owed to him and other people in the QA department
4529740	4534640	that he's trying to get together for the class action suit also in the state of California
4534640	4541060	they're very strict on if you work eight hour days you have to get a 30 minute lunch like
4541060	4544900	by law legally they have to give you that and also breaks 15 minute breaks every couple
4544900	4549740	of hours he's also saying he's saying that they basically said too bad so sad for you
4549740	4553580	you don't get those lunches and breaks because of crunch time where they had to get a game
4553580	4558020	out the door so I guess the QA department was written really hard and he's trying to
4558020	4563740	sue them for the fact that they had that department run with no lunches or breaks and had people
4563740	4570180	who weren't salary their hours hourly employees not getting paid for their overtime and he
4570180	4574940	worked he started working there in December of 2006 it doesn't say when he left the firm
4574940	4580660	and the case the original complaint was filed in June of 2010 so this is already a little
4580660	4585420	over a year old but legal things are always so slow I always go to snail's pace and it
4585420	4591540	looks like it hasn't been thrown out or anything so this may actually go to trial you know
4591540	4596660	he's trying to scrounge up multiple people to both strengthen his case and also to get
4596660	4600540	the class action thing going I kind of hope it does go to trial because I feel like I've
4600540	4605180	got nothing else to say on this because I'm not in this dude's shoes you know and it's
4605180	4608200	one of those cases where I think there's always you know there's three sides to every story
4608200	4614420	right your side my side and the truth right and so I'm I kind of want something like this
4614420	4618280	to go to trial just so we can kind of hear like I know we always hear those horror stories
4618280	4623700	in the industry about you know what these claims he's making totally seems legit based
4623700	4631460	on other things we've heard from other companies when I worked in a call center when we had
4631460	4638620	you know like in a call center your your company has these service level agreements like you
4638620	4642420	won't be on hold for more than two minutes all that bullcrap our wait times were like
4642420	4648940	40 minutes so our metrics were total shit show and I was working 10 hour days and basically
4648940	4652380	they said we're going to put you down for a 30 minute lunch but if you could only make
4652380	4659900	it 20 eat fast and you know could you do that because we're really short on call coverage
4659900	4663940	you know that's the kind of shit they pull in real sweatshop environments like a QA Center
4663940	4667420	where you've got all of these testers trying to get a product out the door because it has
4667420	4672100	to go gold in a certain amount of time I think basically what I'm saying is I've experienced
4672100	4678580	that firsthand where I've worked at a job where management was like can you can you
4678580	4683580	eat at your desk while working also this is such a tricky scenario because you do want
4683580	4687380	to say you know yeah stick it to the man stick it to the corporation so forth and these things
4687380	4690420	should be fair but then you kind of also look at the other hand and go well they'll probably
4690420	4694020	just turn around out sources to another country because that's unfortunate where a lot of
4694020	4698280	these jobs are going and I don't want to get too political and so forth but I mean that's
4698280	4704260	just the world we're in right now you know what I mean and we've even heard of QA jobs
4704260	4710460	being outsourced and so forth and I at the same time I don't think that it's right that
4710460	4716180	somebody has to not claim time or you know not say the accurate time they worked or what
4716180	4721060	have you but I think there needs to be better foresight in the planning of games and it's
4721060	4727740	oh shock and awe mismanagement in all of these cases right mismanagement bad staffing planning
4727740	4732780	bad you know what a shocker well yeah it's because the managers they're managing these
4732780	4739020	employees probably get paid on how early the game is done and they get a bonus based on
4739020	4744660	that so they want their bonus to be big because it's all about their pocket money and people
4744660	4749500	fear that if they don't comply you know what and and such pop when you were in that situation
4749500	4755780	what were you gonna do tell them no well in my case when I had to work the mandatory overtime
4755780	4761780	I was paid for it but um yeah it's like this is really shitty and I want to walk out of
4761780	4765740	this building for 30 minutes and clear my head but I can't because they're basically
4765740	4770100	telling me that I don't get a lunch but I got rent to pay I got to pay bills I'm not
4770100	4773540	just gonna flip them off and quit your job will end up overseas if you don't do it yeah
4773540	4781020	so and that's like that's that's the real problem that's and is there an easy answer
4781020	4786020	I don't know but I guess the the fact that this guy is making such a big complaint it
4786020	4792020	sounds like this is a pretty widespread you know supported by management abuse of an entire
4792020	4796860	department rather than you know an ugly week where they had to do sketchy things it sounds
4796860	4800660	like this was just really and the release the case that he's trying to present is that
4800660	4806300	they you know it was run that the QA department was run very terribly based on on how long
4806300	4809540	we've been doing this show or how long you all have been listening in the stories we
4809540	4813660	read week in and week out about what happens in the gaming world does this lawsuit surprise
4813660	4822380	anybody any anyone surprised now why not just comes with the industry exactly but does that
4822380	4829120	make it right no well also um so he he's an ex take to interactive employee the division
4829120	4836300	that he was in is now called visual concepts formerly 2k sports that held the Sega sports
4836300	4844060	licenses so I can imagine in a that QA environment if you know EA's BS they're putting out the
4844060	4850540	new Madden or whatever they need to get their game out in time for what EA is doing so basically
4850540	4855860	all of the sports games that take two has put out since 2006 those are the games that
4855860	4861380	would have been affected by this QA department so I could definitely see how you know if
4861380	4865380	Madden comes out and your game is supposed to come out a week before and you don't make
4865380	4869860	your gold pressing of it then that's Monday down the drain well let's let's see it go
4869860	4874740	to trial I want to see I might might I want to see this case defended I want to see what
4874740	4878900	happens I want to say that for once can we not settle out of court and let's let's do
4878900	4882980	it the good old American way and waste taxpayer monies on the on an actual courtroom trial
4882980	4887860	lawsuit because this is something I'm generally I would like to see how this plays out but
4887860	4893380	it'll get settled they all do yeah if they take this unless this guy's totally full of
4893380	4899660	crap and he doesn't have the documentation it very well could be and we just don't know
4899660	4904500	but I think it says something that we look at this and we go yeah not too surprising
4904500	4909620	right I mean so I think we're kind of saying well this doesn't sound like it's full of
4909620	4913220	shit I mean it could be in this case we don't know this guy this guy could just be a bitter
4913220	4921660	Betty but we don't know that's why it has to go to trial so we can find out anyway let's
4921660	4925740	move on with more gaming news oh yeah well we thought it was gonna be a short show tonight
4925740	4933100	we're already an hour and a half into part a anyhow we'll go quick on you watch so Sony
4933100	4939940	is talking smack about Microsoft yeah when when they're are they not basically their
4939940	4944720	comment is publishers are getting the living crack or living crap kicked out of them by
4944720	4952600	Microsoft according to Rob Dyer Sony's SVP of public relations yes he is an expert of
4952600	4957820	everything that Microsoft does basically there is a recent interview concerning Microsoft's
4957820	4966140	publishing policies basically the thing that he was pissed off about was Microsoft's content
4966140	4972580	submission and release policy which forbids its games from being released first or with
4972580	4979780	exclusive content on other platforms so for example titles for Xbox 360 must ship at least
4979780	4986320	simultaneously with other video game platforms and must have at least or have at least feature
4986320	4992940	and content parity on disk with other video game platform versions in all regions where
4992940	4997380	the title is available if these conditions are not met Microsoft reserves the right to
4997380	5002620	not allow content to be released on the Xbox 360 it's actually interesting for a few reasons
5002620	5008300	because I know for a fact like was a Dead Space 2 and stuff they had you know content
5008300	5015820	that was on the blu-ray version of you know the for the ps3 and that wasn't on 360 version
5015820	5025180	you mean like what it was the HD remake of Dead Space the Wii one that they had you know
5025180	5031980	the on-rails shooter one they had that and then also I believe on the battlefield 3 might
5031980	5036860	have something there's is like the original battlefield 1942 I think was supposed to be
5036860	5042180	on one of this it's a lot of EA games they'll do that where they'll have exclusive thingies
5042180	5047420	so but we don't know if this is really true or not right this is according to their policy
5047420	5053180	I don't know of course you know Xbox is defending them they're saying we're a little biased
5053180	5059460	so obviously we're gonna look to our product or to protect our own space as best we can
5059460	5064740	and get exclusivity in other words we're gonna bully the shit out of everyone so that we
5064740	5068920	don't die it's like I think I think what Chris and other representatives at Microsoft are
5068920	5073820	doing is protecting inferior technology and this is according to that Rob Dyer again if
5073820	5079020	they I think they want to dumb it down and keep it as pedestrian as possible so that
5079020	5083260	if you want to do anything on blu-ray or if you have extra content above nine gigs or
5083260	5088140	you want to do anything of that nature you better sure as heck remember that Microsoft
5088140	5095620	can't handle that I just bickering ballots it's almost like the exact same story the
5095620	5100060	salacious pop just read except this time it's not the manager it's Microsoft using their
5100060	5104500	whole to strong arm developers to get what they want because they're out there in the
5104500	5109680	marketplace more than PlayStation but see here's here's where I kind of question this
5109680	5114900	whole thing I have a big question mark about this not just the examples you gave but Japan
5114900	5121540	Microsoft can't get away with this in Japan no how could they possibly and maybe even
5121540	5124900	Europe I don't know what the sales numbers look like in Europe but I think you know America's
5124900	5129620	the only place for the Xbox really dominates the ps3 and that gap is closing I think is
5129620	5134420	important to note too so this might be Microsoft's way to kind of make sure that the Xbox doesn't
5134420	5139540	die but it's going to have the reverse effect isn't it like I look at this ago this is just
5139540	5143100	done this is already if this is already in effect I don't think it's really hurting the
5143100	5149940	many I don't know it's just but if Sony were to do the same thing who loses the consumer
5149940	5154740	well that's what here's what you didn't just do then it's pretty simple and they were done
5154740	5159980	this is you put out free download content you put a voucher in in the game and you get
5159980	5165140	free download content on PlayStation 3 it falls within all that no here's what you do
5165140	5170740	you make your game for the PlayStation 3 and fuck the 360 I mean if that's if you think
5170740	5175600	you've got a good enough game I mean PlayStation 3 is allowed to have good exclusives and they
5175600	5182180	do have good exclusive souls and little big planet yeah but sometimes it it helps to have
5182180	5186760	the whole market share of Xbox 360 as well because you know they have more of a market
5186760	5191560	share than the PlayStation 3 and yeah there's good exclusives coming on to the PlayStation
5191560	5196740	but I mean if it's that minor of a thing if you're just adding a few extra missions or
5196740	5200220	whatever you can do is free yellow content it still falls within the requirements that
5200220	5205860	they want and you can still market it as an exclusive I'm not trying to come off as a
5205860	5210540	Sony fanboy either because I do love a lot of what Microsoft's done with Xbox I mean
5210540	5215860	obviously Xbox Live Arcade is something everybody's trying to copy now Xbox Live set the bar and
5215860	5221100	so forth granted I liked Microsoft a lot more before my account was hacked for 125 bucks
5221100	5225140	I've been able to play for three weeks but I digress there's a lot of things that Microsoft
5225140	5230820	does right but the unfortunate thing is this type of act of desperation is almost what
5230820	5235020	this sounds like I think that quote about trying to make up for inferior technology
5235020	5238480	really hits the nail on the head yeah it's kind of like they're using their clout in
5238480	5244860	the marketplace to bring the PlayStation down to their level because they're not capable
5244860	5249260	of coming up to Sony's level hardware wise perfect example and I'm sure this hasn't been
5249260	5255980	announced yet rage rages on one blu-ray on the PlayStation 3 rages on three to four DVDs
5255980	5262620	on the Xbox 360 that sucks it's not a big deal I don't give a shit about this deal I
5262620	5267980	don't give a shit fantasy 13 was on several DVDs didn't really change the game lost odyssey
5267980	5276180	yeah wasn't it the atlas game Catherine that came out there isn't room on a 360 360 disc
5276180	5282540	for the Japanese dialogue with English subtitles so because they can't fit it on the 360 version
5282540	5286820	they took it off of the ps3 version is that right or else or else the 360 words and what's
5286820	5293260	gonna sell it think so because I mean I've seen you know ISO rips of that and Catherine's
5293260	5300500	not that big a game it's like it's 40 45 gigs I mean they've got room but I I just think
5300500	5306420	they didn't bother sometimes they just don't put the extra language track in there I mean
5306420	5309860	a lot of video games don't put the Japanese language tracks in sometimes game fighting
5309860	5314380	games and so forth do but you know the the speech in that is very short but you know
5314380	5318780	most role-playing games out there don't and I don't have it's not an RPG but most RPGs
5318780	5322660	don't bother with the second track it's actually kind of really cool when they have it there
5322660	5329180	you know and you can play in either language but very rare right so anyway I guess we'll
5329180	5334460	see if this kind of holds out to be I don't I want to say if it holds out to be true but
5334460	5342120	it I guess we are hearing it is kind of fact but you have some cases where it's not so
5342120	5346180	yeah I mean I don't know when this one effect if it's just something that they just now
5346180	5350940	put out but all I know is like I know that there's been titles and I think there's some
5350940	5360860	that haven't come out yet I actually I know another perfect example for was it of course
5360860	5367580	now that the titles of disappear Bioshock Infinite is going to have the first Bioshock
5367580	5374060	game on disk for the PlayStation 3 version not so much on the 360 because they have the
5374060	5379860	extra space for that but I know EA think had I want to say is 19 Battlefield 1942 I'm not
5379860	5383500	sure if that was on the PlayStation 3 version of Battlefield 3 but one of these games is
5383500	5388340	coming out had they did a few of these like that were had like another game on the disk
5388340	5392700	because they have so much space Microsoft's got to be but I mean look Microsoft's got
5392700	5397780	to be a little worried because it for the first time in this whole generation of games
5397780	5403300	where it's been PS3 versus Xbox we were hearing a lot more favorable things about the or about
5403300	5410860	the PlayStation 3 back in May was a May when Portal 2 and Mortal Kombat came out most people
5410860	5414820	opted to get those games on the PlayStation 3 and that was really the first time you were
5414820	5419500	hearing that because you had an extra character on the PlayStation 3 version Kratos right
5419500	5423380	of Mortal Kombat and when it came to Portal 2 you had the whole steam integration and
5423380	5428180	a free copy on the PC I mean which wasn't even remotely close to what the 360 could
5428180	5435260	offer and again I'm not trying to dog on 360 360 is is proven the better system and then
5435260	5440820	a PlayStation 3 in some cases but you know I think now it's going to a point where Xbox
5440820	5446260	can't just kind of rest on their laurels of well we were the cheaper system for so long
5446260	5449980	that more people have Xboxes in their houses than they do PlayStations because that gap
5449980	5453580	is slowly closing at the end of the day it's going to be the games that speak for themselves
5453580	5457380	it's going to take developers if these rules are true is standing up to these rules and
5457380	5463180	saying forget it we can survive as a PlayStation 3 exclusive it worked for Demon Souls it worked
5463180	5470660	for you know whatever other first-party Sony games are out there and 3d game heroes and
5470660	5478300	so forth so guys you know in chat says la noir wouldn't have so much DLC if they ran
5478300	5483940	it on PlayStation 3 only and maybe sometimes the DLC is part of the whole plan we're gonna
5483940	5489300	get you to pay 60 bucks and then another 20 paid unlock exactly paid unlock content all
5489300	5494180	right quickly let's talk about a Wii game that's right a new Wii game more information
5494180	5498940	coming out on it tonight Square Enix is going to be revealing more information about Dragon
5498940	5507460	Quest on Ustream at 2 p.m. Japan time September 5th that's 10 o'clock Pacific tonight so in
5507460	5511260	about two hours they'll be starting that event who knows we might still be live at this pace
5511260	5516260	tonight but they're probably gonna be showing more information on Dragon Quest 10 although
5516260	5519960	it could be a new announcement they announced a long time ago some of you forgot Dragon
5519960	5523580	Quest 10 is going to be coming on the Wii they said that back in 2008 but they have
5523580	5528700	yet to show off anything about the game it's going to be interesting to see if they stick
5528700	5534500	to their guns and they put this game out on the Wii relatively late in the Wii's lifecycle
5534500	5537740	because they would have to announce this and really have a date ready to go relatively
5537740	5543420	soon I worry it's gonna suffer a little bit from what Dragon Quest 8 suffered from and
5543420	5547460	that was it came out he was on the ps2 right towards the end it was on the ps2 at the very
5547460	5551500	very end and it's the same thing that hurt Final Fantasy 12 both those games came out
5551500	5555940	I don't think very far apart from each other and both those games you know for the hardcore
5555940	5559380	gamer got overlooked a little bit because everybody was putting 360s and Wiis in their
5559380	5566180	homes and so forth just 360s and other new stuff 7 was ps1 right so they've been really
5566180	5570460	like those games don't have really come out as often as they used to know and the Dragon
5570460	5574860	Quest 9 was on the DS obviously and now 10 is you know was announced some time ago on
5574860	5580980	the Wii because for a while there especially back in 2008 it seemed like the Wii was everything
5580980	5584700	it's going to be interesting to see if they stuck to that or if maybe one of the announcements
5584700	5589460	we're getting today is and it might show up on other systems I kind of don't think they'll
5589460	5594820	do that keep in mind Dragon Quest is still a very Japanese centric game yeah Dragon Quest
5594820	5598980	9 everyone went clown shit for that game in Japan and over here like people that know
5598980	5602900	what Dragon Quest is bought it but it wasn't the phenomenon that it wasn't that it was
5602900	5608860	over there you can I bet your ass it's not coming out on Xbox period it's just not you
5608860	5616780	know it's a Japanese game and Xbox is not what it is here PlayStation 3 I just don't
5616780	5621500	think so I don't think they have a need to maybe Dragon Quest 11 probably not Dragon
5621500	5628980	Quest 10 well I mean different studio obviously but through the 360 did have Blue Dragon which
5628980	5635340	was by what mist Walker studio and also the artwork was Akira Toriyama who did Dragon
5635340	5640220	Ball Z and Dragon Quest so there's that connection there it wouldn't be unheard of it came out
5640220	5644700	on the 360 because we've had a game that looks like it already true true all right so we'll
5644700	5649100	see what happens by the time most of you are hearing this on the podcast actually we'll
5649100	5652940	have more information on that so be looking for that on Labor Day by the way just real
5652940	5657380	quick there is going to be a Dragon Quest 10 trailer in the Wii anniversary collection
5657380	5661260	I mean this just really strengthens that yes they're committed to the Wii I don't know
5661260	5666980	if you've heard but they are bundling I think it's 1 2 3 and the Super Nintendo remakes
5666980	5672820	of 1 & 2 are all going to be on a Wii anniversary debt disc it's very it's like that Mario collection
5672820	5677380	they did it's like that for Dragon Quest which is cool but it won't be it won't be on the
5677380	5682380	U.S. to be fair though it's still more content that was on that fucking Mario disc hey Lisa
5682380	5685980	you know what they put more than one game on there guess what Nintendo you could have
5685980	5692780	done that those discs they can hold more than a Super NES ROM well it's just 1 2 & 3 I would
5692780	5701640	have loved to see that rip one meg it's like okay I'm looking for a disc I'm I wish that
5701640	5705180	anniversary collection would come out in the U.S. actually I really love the first Dragon
5705180	5714420	Quest game excuse me Dragon Warrior remember so all right anyhow that is coming out by
5714420	5719700	the time most of you guys hear this so look for it so let's pop a couple weeks ago we
5719700	5725800	we reported on a story about the video game history museum project and how they were trying
5725800	5730660	to get the money they needed to get the thing off the ground the video game history museum
5730660	5733460	is I think it's not like it's just three or four dudes that are running this and they
5733460	5738460	usually have an exhibit at the classic gaming Expo in Las Vegas where they would have floor
5738460	5747420	space for their video game history pieces and all the information there and they really
5747420	5753180	wanted to give this thing a permanent home somewhere in the Silicon Valley near the San
5753180	5758780	Jose sort of you know the southern Bay Area of California which of course is where Apple
5758780	5764100	and Google and eBay and all of those companies are located I'm also I think EA is down there
5764100	5771140	and I'd awesome so that's that's where it's going to be and their Kickstarter was a success
5771140	5778980	and the story is that they are $20,000 over what they initially wanted I got the oh I
5778980	5784420	had the Kickstarter page open but I closed it but it's like I think they had 700 donors
5784420	5794140	and the target goal was 30,000 on their Kickstarter page and now they're at 50 something so yeah
5794140	5800540	no real update yet as to you know whether like what what the building's gonna look like
5800540	5804580	or if they actually have a space for it like bought if they're gonna buy the plot to build
5804580	5809860	it on but yeah they made their money so hopefully within maybe a couple years we'll have a permanent
5809860	5817800	video game Hall of Fame history museum in California for us to go to why remember kind
5817800	5822180	of reporting on this a couple weeks ago and it sounded kind of cool at the time so I'm
5822180	5827140	glad they kind of you know got their kinks worked out what have you so what do you say
5827140	5831660	road trip actually I've seen their exhibit at Classic Gaming Expo before and it's pretty
5831660	5836420	cool so I think it's neat that they're kind of going to have a place for this and if you
5836420	5843580	go to their Kickstarter page which I can find and post into chat if you dare certain landmarks
5843580	5851180	if you donate 10 20 $50 and so on there are perks that you get once the museum is a reality
5851180	5856840	like a ticket to admission or something like VIP a ticket to get in first before everyone
5856840	5864420	else or whatever yeah creative most most Kickstarter pages are like that right right all right

6207180	6210200	game of the week even though dark soccer is not here we're still gonna do one but first
6210200	6213780	we have a couple more stories to cover let me actually read a couple comments from chat
6213780	6218960	because during the release date some of our chatters were talking act deft found the size
6218960	6222980	of the Mario collection on the Wii that Loki was asking about which is basically the lost
6222980	6231500	levels ROM right act F says the American version of the game is 13.31 megabytes great waste
6231500	6236860	of fourth you know was at 4,000 megabytes on a you know over 4,000 megabytes on a goddamn
6236860	6242140	DVD is seriously that layer don't forget some games like Mario Galaxy and Xenoblade are
6242140	6246580	doing they should have put on a dual layer that just to be extravagant that this great
6246580	6251340	there has so little on it you can literally put your fingers and rub it all over the disk
6251340	6254820	and it would be just fine you know what you could do is if you you know if you were into
6254820	6261340	the the backup quote unquote you know what I'm saying you could do a GameCube size disc
6261340	6266180	and put the ROM on that and load it off a GameCube disk but with the we know it was
6266180	6272720	a we disk I don't know it's just that's pathetic is what it is they really should just really
6272720	6278540	say no matter why you mad though and then lastly let's see a cyber beast is talking
6278540	6282740	about I really need the Nyko or Nikko zoom that's the whole thing on the connect and
6282740	6286700	yeah I got delayed wasn't supposed to be coming a hole would have been out already if it was
6286700	6293340	coming out in time but it's September now well and Japan's getting it and I I want one
6293340	6297880	too I it's I think so many people are interested in that and by the way if you haven't heard
6297880	6302140	of that that's the thing that you can actually put on your connect and it will help a smaller
6302140	6305300	room be more effective with the we like it's just it's basically like a wide-angle lens
6305300	6310280	basically for your connect the connect and it's a great idea and I wonder if Microsoft
6310280	6314500	isn't going to just kind of change the connect because it seems like one of the this is so
6314500	6319460	badly needed you know so we'll see all right anyhow let's move on with a couple more quick
6319460	6328460	stories for you guys Loki avalanche the developers behind the just cause series they have some
6328460	6335660	comments regarding DRM they believe it's a threat to the entertaining experience basically
6335660	6346540	was it a Christopher Sundberg he said if a DRM system constantly needs to be defended
6346540	6351940	something must be wrong as a developer you will never win over any fans if you constantly
6351940	6358420	let everyone know how much it costs to develop a game and how much money you lose I don't
6358420	6363860	like always on DRM solutions at all since they offer nothing to the consumer if you
6363860	6369820	continuously give something extra for registering and being online and award them for actually
6369820	6375880	playing a pain for and playing your game it'd be different but always on DRM says thank
6375880	6380420	you for buying our game we trust you as far as we can throw you and yeah that kind of
6380420	6385140	makes sense and I love how Ubisoft likes to spin it oh well you know what if you buy our
6385140	6391860	game and this isn't even necessarily always on stuff this is I would say going to the
6391860	6397060	the little codes that you have with your new games where you get multiplayer we're offering
6397060	6402940	you free multiplayer with this code no you would have had multiplayer in there anyways
6402940	6408020	but you're being a dick is what it is you just don't want people you know to be on your
6408020	6417220	online service if they didn't buy the game new whatever I just it's stupid well isn't
6417220	6422580	it true that when all this DRM stuff kind of the person that loses is the people that
6422580	6427820	are buying these games legitimately exactly and I I'm very curious and I will definitely
6427820	6434220	be reporting on that how quickly the DRM gets cracked on driver it will be fast I guarantee
6434220	6441620	it all right well before we get to the classic game of the week tonight we have a new segment
6441620	6445820	here on orange lounge radio because you know we just see we see too many new stories that
6445820	6450140	are like this and so we just need to give it its own segment on the show and it's called
6450140	6466060	local news making gamers look bad that's right local game for local news making gamers look
6466060	6472420	bad and for tonight's local news making gamers look bad we're going to go to the station
6472420	6479320	WSB TV channel 2 and where are they located they're in Georgia but I don't think they're
6479320	6483500	in Atlanta station I think they're like northern Georgia so we're gonna get to a story that
6483500	6489740	they ran this week that I captured some of the gaming blogs about pornographic drawings
6489740	6494980	that were found inside a used Wii game and I know what you're thinking this isn't really
6494980	6500220	a news story I really this makes it on the news yet no this is this is the whole point
6500220	6506100	of this segment it's local news making gamers look bad so yes it does have to do with gaming
6506100	6510220	because it's your local news station oh it isn't Atlanta station it's action news 2 in
6510220	6514020	Atlanta oh Bobby had had a show tonight he would have been all over this this is in his
6514020	6519380	backyard this isn't by the way the town and remember this in the back your mind coming
6519380	6525100	Georgia and that's c-u-m-m-i-n-g like I'm coming right that's exactly where the story
6525100	6532700	takes place so here we go pornographic drawings from action news 2 in Atlanta when a six-year-old
6532700	6537940	boy found pornographic drawings inside the box of a Nintendo Wii game the packaging says
6537940	6542660	it's suitable for everyone channel Napier Viteri is live tonight in Forsyth County with
6542660	6547600	the discovery parents were not prepared to explain Amy and I apologize for the audio
6547600	6552420	is very very low on this I might have to fix it in post-production a little bit but again
6552420	6561720	the local internet news is very not good at equalizing their audio so sorry Jervita Tracy
6561720	6566260	Turner bought her six-year-old son this game at a local GameStop it says on the on the
6566260	6571420	outside of the box rated E for everyone but what he found inside is for mature adults
6571420	6577020	only let's find this one Tracy Turner has a stack of kid-friendly video games for six-year-old
6577020	6586400	JT and four-year-old Madison the kids are cute I'm not gonna talk bad about the kids
6586400	6591060	and it's it's cute that they do have these Wii games that they play so her son pick out
6591060	6594700	this game for their Wii system it's rated by the way it's this the game they're showing
6594700	6597740	I don't know why they don't name it this is kind of like when the local news here did
6597740	6601760	the story on us and then never named our station remember that they were doing the story on
6601760	6604620	podcasting and they interviewed us but they never said it was Orange Lawns radio they
6604620	6608980	just said these are three local guys that do podcasts about video games never named
6608980	6614300	it the game that they're looking at here is Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games okay E
6614300	6618340	for everyone appropriate for all ages but when her son and some of his friends opened
6618340	6623420	the box the images he found inside were anything but they were extremely inappropriate it was
6623420	6628440	very of sexual nature Turner showed me the drawings on the inside cover they show sexually
6628440	6633960	suggestive images and detailed human anatomy my favorite part is that they show and I realize
6633960	6638000	it's a radio show but they're showing parts of the picture cropped yeah but they're very
6638000	6642560	cropped so it just looks like it looks like these happy little faces and somebody does
6642560	6645980	have some artistic talent here it looks like some it looks like someone just drew stick
6645980	6650620	figures with like a giant dong or something on it with like it with like a sharpie marker
6650620	6655660	exactly exactly not prepared for to answer the questions of what was going on in the
6655660	6660260	picture so Turner tells me she called GameStop to let them know what was included in their
6660260	6664380	merchandise she says an employee thanked her for calling and hung up she even called the
6664380	6668300	corporate office but tells me she got the same response it kind of shocking because
6668300	6673300	I expected them to like have a little bit more of a reaction like I did oh my gosh that's
6673300	6679420	bonus content okay you should be thanking us oh well didn't you know GameStop has the
6679420	6684980	exclusive with Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games you get free wiener pics with every
6684980	6689700	purchase how much sex goes on at the Olympics in real life okay I'll have you know that
6689700	6695420	we should charge the extra for those wiener pics you bring it to us I apologize you know
6695420	6700420	I'm so sorry you know like let me see you know like something else and we just did not
6700420	6705620	receive that I took the game cover and went to the GameStop in coming wow this is investigative
6705620	6710660	journalism and I love this shot of the reporter walking in the GameStop like I'm gonna go
6710660	6714620	march on in there and get to the bottom of what happened here to the same employee who
6714620	6719180	took Turner's call she says no one apologized that you just said thanks for letting us know
6719180	6723840	and then hung up I actually apologized to her five times I also called the corporate
6723840	6728700	office and someone told me they would get back to me these compelling shots of the reporter
6728700	6732980	on her iPhone like I'm calling them right now and I'm looking very intently at the phone
6732980	6740900	motive I just wanted them to say I'm sorry I got an email from GameStop's corporate office
6740900	6745340	this evening asking me for Turner's information so they can look into what happened further
6745340	6749580	as for Turner she tells me from now on she's going to buy new games spend a few more dollars
6749580	6754100	so she can avoid this happening again we're live in Forsyth County Amy Napier-Viteri channel
6754100	6759060	2 action news Nightbeat that's it it's propaganda propaganda from the developers and the publishers
6759060	6762700	of these games they're just trying to get people to think you know what if I buy used
6762700	6767900	I'm gonna get fucking dick pics in my my games buy new no dick pics in new games here's the
6767900	6775380	thing I I'm not making fun of the mother because she has a legitimate complaint yes she she
6775380	6780380	really does I mean the fact that it's on the fucking news in Atlanta is a little weird
6780380	6786060	to me like okay but let's let's be real well let's let's just it's probably one of those
6786060	6791580	things where she went to GameStop she got kind of like well thanks she got an apathetic
6791580	6796780	and then so she went to one of those consumer activists you know that things and the local
6796780	6802760	the local news feeds on that shit the local news feeds on that fucking like call the news
6802760	6808060	center and and whatever show it is that works and sometimes you know they do they do help
6808060	6813380	out like in cases of this isn't one of those cases that really need is like yeah that's
6813380	6818700	unfortunate but but this is just a seized opportunity I mean for local news station
6818700	6823980	this is really okay look at the what what does she want she wanted GameStop to fucking
6823980	6829200	say sorry about that man like any of us in the GameStop employees shoes you know what
6829200	6833260	to say I'm really sorry to hear about that ma'am if you wouldn't wouldn't mind bringing
6833260	6837140	the game back to the store we'll get you a full refund or we'll get you a replacement
6837140	6842300	copy Dan you're shaking your head no you disagree get Dan a mic it's like we did get Dan a mic
6842300	6848140	you disagree that the woman who would have just laughed at her you would have been like
6848140	6852340	you got a game with drawings in it you're stupid and then hung up damn well that's not
6852340	6858460	what you would have done I would have actually cop to drawing him would you have done it
6858460	6863260	in a humorous way though no I don't know I would have had her if she was mad I would
6863260	6867120	have just told her to bring the game but yeah exactly thank you Dan you bring the game back
6867120	6872060	and we'll replace the game or give you I would have replaced the game I just would have wanted
6872060	6875860	to see what was done on the inside of the cover come on yes you would you replace the
6875860	6882220	game and or give her money back give her a different manual it's it's a used game anyway
6882220	6886020	like fucking GameStop makes hella money on those games you could have afforded to give
6886020	6891700	more that's added value that's like a deus ex coupon but better all right you're not
6891700	6896420	helping Dan no no I never help all right but you know to be honest and now it's on the
6896420	6900660	local news because she didn't get that apology or that reaction that any one of us with a
6900660	6905860	shred of customer service in us knows that she should have had just an apology yeah so
6905860	6910060	it sounds like the GameStop employee that obviously looked at the bass back of the disc
6910060	6917740	to make sure it was scratched when they took the trade in failed to notice the PP drawings
6917740	6921140	on the inside cover that the previous owner drew in there when he wanted to get his five
6921140	6925780	bucks used credit which you know okay wake up call maybe GameStop needs to be thumbing
6925780	6929620	through those pages I mean I wouldn't have thought to oh I better look through the manual
6929620	6934360	to make sure no one drew a dick in here you know and to be fair the person who probably
6934360	6938500	drew it probably forgot it was in there like if you do something stupid before usually
6938500	6942940	before you sell a game back like remember back when it was cartridges and like if you
6942940	6946440	name your character cunt like you're going to erase you're going to have the courtesy
6946440	6950980	probably to erase that file before you say oh all right some of you won't you get yeah
6950980	6955780	you get a game from blockbuster and it's like boobs butts turd it's like Oregon Trail but
6955780	6961540	you just name your Final Fantasy six characters after it I'm sorry you know they're like how
6961540	6965900	old is six and four maybe they wouldn't know what's really going on but I would have like
6965900	6970780	I would really ha ha that's funny yeah but here's my point guys is that is that this
6970780	6976480	really isn't a big issue the woman has a legitimate complaint a manager needs to spank an associate
6976480	6981420	at the front line of game stop here and this this could be done Dan but it doesn't need
6981420	6985420	to be on the fucking news gamers are dirty ass people though and that well and that's
6985420	6989860	what this new story is conveyed it's like gamers are all sex crazed maniacs who draw
6989860	6997140	pee-pees in Mario and Sonic at the Mario's got a pee-pee it gets way better than that
6997140	7001180	I cannot even tell you the amount of times I was pulling in a system for trade and I
7001180	7007700	popped open the disk drawer and there was porn in it it was a lot and not like you know
7007700	7012920	you know fake porn either like real fucking hardcore porn and you're just like really
7012920	7017460	pal you couldn't have like open it up and pulled your you know your disk out and put
7017460	7021780	it away I just to get a reaction out of you though you know it was like people they were
7021780	7027420	always like I can't believe oh my god you know you'd give them the disk you'd wipe off
7027420	7033860	your hands I swear to god I opened a disk once as a CD case and there was a cock ring
7033860	7041220	inside I'm not even fucking with you and you can tell cuz it's got that funky latex e condom
7041220	7051100	smell sort of thing going on oh my god close it is handed back said that's yours drugs
7051100	7057160	there have been you know joints and shit in cases gamers are dirty ass people so someone
7057160	7063220	graffiting inside their game cases and forgetting about it that's nothing PSP memory cards were
7063220	7067380	awesome if you ever audited them the ones that we took on trade I bet you that like
7067380	7073500	50% of them had porn on them we sold one to a kid once his mom came back she was so mad
7073500	7080860	at us she's like don't you check this it's like no take it home format it you know if
7080860	7084060	you're if you're 14 year old decided he was gonna look around on it and keep it on his
7084060	7091900	PSP that's because he's a 14 year old who's not like LSD or something like that exactly
7091900	7096180	so so you're saying you're what I'm hearing out of you Dan is that it could have been
7096180	7102300	a lot fucking worse and this is nothing yeah gamers are skeevy fucking terrible people
7102300	7106860	you guys all know you are all right we got a new name for the segment here it's orange
7106860	7115720	lounge radio featuring Dan making gamers look bad I had a friend confide in me that he had
7115720	7121620	to call Netflix because he wanted to send back his copy of there will be blood or kill
7121620	7128740	bill 2 and he just accidentally put there will be cock yeah it no case it was like it
7128740	7134740	was like it was like boner bros 12 return of the skater teens or whatever and he's like
7134740	7140820	I Netflix hello there's a movie on the way to you and their little return cardboard night
7140820	7145100	I have the movie here I sent you the wrong thing and they're like oh this happens all
7145100	7151120	the time we'll send it back how do you make that mistake like I would imagine the pictures
7151120	7159640	a lot different between you know what what movie was it do you remember it was as far
7159640	7165540	as a porn as far as porn names go it was not a tasteful one I'll put it that way I'm not
7165540	7169340	the porn like the actual Netflix movie let's just there's a big difference between like
7169340	7177220	sense and sensibility and sniffing balls like big difference between what those DVDs probably
7177220	7183340	look like you know yeah and he was worried that there that the disc web whatever it at
7183340	7190200	Netflix Netflix is all automated so it would have sent that on to the next person in their
7190200	7194860	queue and they would have ended up on a local news so he did his due diligence and called
7194860	7198980	and said there's porn on the way to you but yeah this yeah this stuff happens all the
7198980	7205080	time doesn't surprise me and I imagine the person who bought the sonic game at full retail
7205080	7209100	you know was up late at night and like this game is terrible so he took the instruction
7209100	7213320	booklet he's like here's what I think of this game he just threw a big dick this game is
7213320	7222500	cock and then he put it away that's why what happened fantastic we need to go back to a
7222500	7229380	time when gaming was much simpler and easier back before people were drawing penises and
7229380	7233340	instruction manual I just kidding people have always been drawing penises and instruction
7233340	7237580	manuals right it's a classic game of the week every week here on the program Dark Sakura
7237580	7240500	takes a trip into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks you all should
7240500	7245660	be playing this week but she's not here so not this week so this week Salacious Pop is
7245660	7250140	going to take a trip into Dark Sakura's gaming vault and pull out a game that he thinks you
7250140	7255460	all should be playing this week Salacious Pop what is the classic game of the week I'm
7255460	7259940	finally giving up the whole Sierra Online classic PC thing I've sort of written that
7259940	7267100	into the ground so I'm taking it to Lagoon on the Super Nintendo all right let's hear
7267100	7277140	some music from Lagoon so Lagoon got its notoriety because it was a RPG that came out
7277140	7283260	near the beginning of the console's life obviously those of us that remember when this Super
7283260	7289680	Nintendo launched there was Final Fantasy 2 or 4 that was a launch title the really
7289680	7295180	big heavy hitter RPGs like Chrono Trigger Final Fantasy 3 didn't come until much later
7295180	7299260	in this in the SNES's life cycle. Final Fantasy 2 wasn't technically a launch title but it
7299260	7303380	would be that launch window it was it was the Christmas that turn that Nintendo loves
7303380	7309080	launch window yeah so Lagoon came out within a year or a year and a half when there wasn't
7309080	7315780	really much in the way of RPGs to play after you've beaten Final Fantasy Lagoon was a top
7315780	7326020	down sort of think like Zelda style game it was a pretty unabashed Wanderers of Ys clone
7326020	7329900	before there was a Zelda game on the Super Nintendo it's important to say because Link
7329900	7334580	to the Past didn't come out till that was like the next Christmas or the Christmas after
7334580	7339500	and the Ys games which I think came out on the TurboGrafx-16 wasn't a system that most
7339500	7347180	people owned really so Lagoon is pretty much a clone as it's sort of like Secret of Mana
7347180	7354340	that style of action RPG I played this game I didn't actually beat it I borrowed it from
7354340	7359260	a friend and I played it for about a week and had to give it up give it back but uh
7359260	7366140	yeah the plot is that you live in Wakeland which is a very lush beautiful world of you
7366140	7373300	know water and everything and this evil wizard has been poisoning the water by the underground
7373300	7378020	castle of Lagoon which is where all of the magical water comes from he poisoned it because
7378020	7384140	he wants to raise a big bad demon very cookie cutter JRPG plot line I remember this game
7384140	7387660	very vividly I love this game too in fact I want to do this classic game at some point
7387660	7394360	but it's very Zelda-esque and uh so yeah so you of course are raised to be the champion
7394360	7398460	of light for no reason you're just raised to be this hero that's been prophesized you
7398460	7403180	know so don't ask questions about the story this is Super NES RPG you are the hero of
7403180	7408300	light and so yeah so the water's been poisoned the evil wizard has taken the castle of Lagoon
7408300	7411940	out of from the bottom of the sea and he's made it float up into the sky you have to
7411940	7417060	go eventually go from village to village and level up and beat dungeons and get treasure
7417060	7424500	and eventually you go up to the final dungeon the castle and the opening sort of has a sort
7424500	7431300	of anime intro or as much as you could do on the Super Nintendo and for those of us
7431300	7436260	that are familiar with YIS the art style they have like the big anime bright eyes that were
7436260	7441500	that was in Wanderers of YIS so that's kind of how the art direction was a bit just a
7441500	7449940	competent RPG not really groundbreaking it was kind of buggy a lot the boss battles were
7449940	7454160	actually pretty hard if you didn't know how to avoid the little bullets that they would
7454160	7459980	shoot at you so it was difficult until you figured it out this game also came out on
7459980	7466260	the Sharp X68000 which was a Sharp PC home computer product that was released only in
7466260	7470100	Japan I was saying nobody had that here yeah that only came out in Japan I think it kind
7470100	7476580	of bombed there it only had a life cycle of a couple years but this was a game that came
7476580	7481660	out for that esoteric system so I'm sure that Dark Sakura would like that it was published
7481660	7491060	by Kemco who also put out a lot of the Warner Brothers Bugs Bunny and Snoopy games I believe
7491060	7494980	they also did the Drakken games Drakken and Dragons view yeah and that was one of the
7494980	7503740	also another Super NES RPG where it was kind of your option if you were an RPG freak like
7503740	7507740	me your options were limited I had Drakken my parents bought me Drakken when I got a
7507740	7511860	Super Nintendo for that Christmas I got Super Mario World because it comes with it and Drakken
7511860	7515860	because that was the game that the Sears person told them to buy or Montgomery Ward or wherever
7515860	7521780	they bought my Super Nintendo so yeah so Lagoon if you've never played it it's a competent
7521780	7528620	top-down action RPG that a lot of you know gamers my age ended up playing just because
7528620	7535220	you know any port in a storm and it wasn't terrible by any means one additional audio
7535220	7541380	clip that I wanted to have you play is when you kill the boss you know you just hack and
7541380	7547780	add in a dies it had this this sort of shriek that played when you killed the boss and every
7547780	7552300	boss whether it was a robot or a dinosaur made the same noise let's play it and see
7552300	7557460	if we can recognize what wave file this is so here goes the boss but you always skip
7557460	7565100	ahead a little bit to the actual path here yeah here we go he's exploiting this first
7565100	7575140	boss by finding a spot in the back of the room here we go sounds like an elephant it
7575140	7580780	is it is the wholesome stage elephant sound industry from Street Fighter 2 whether that
7580780	7585580	came first in Lagoon copied it or probably what happened this actually happens quite
7585580	7589940	a bit in the gaming industry where there's these public domain sound clip files that
7589940	7595100	you will find sometimes like you know how even public domain just like sound like archives
7595100	7599220	that they buy so it's like usually there's little samples of like yeah boy or things
7599220	7602900	like that that you hear like in a DDR song that then you'll hear later in a game somewhere
7602900	7610540	else and it's really weird like I want to say one of the big DR songs you hear the samples
7610540	7617460	somewhere else it's really weird Max 300 the fire that whole thing like those those clips
7617460	7622380	you hear those elsewhere so anyway yes I just thought it was funny that I didn't put this
7622380	7626900	together at the time but you have the boss noise when you kill a boss is the elephant
7626900	7633700	cry and awesome stage Street Fighter 2 nice but the the dungeons in this you know had
7633700	7637500	some pretty clever map design more clever than it probably had any right to you know
7637500	7642780	you could get lost but it was a it was a pretty fast paced game you didn't really have to
7642780	7648300	grind too much you just hit from town to dungeon and there was always something to do so all
7648300	7655540	right good pick classic game of the week everybody Lagoon from Kemko Seika for the Super Nintendo
7655540	7660340	although technically it was also released on the x8600 was the name of the sharp sharp
7660340	7664940	computer yeah over in Japan and there it is your classic game of the week good job Dark
7664940	7668340	Sakura would be very proud did you did you screen your pick with her in advance I know
7668340	7672140	she she knew you were gonna do it but she know what game you're picking no I think she'll
7672140	7676900	like it she'll approve all right we're gonna take a quick break here though guys um gosh
7676900	7680740	I thought it was gonna be a show short tonight part a has been two hours and eight minutes
7680740	7684600	it's like the longest part a I think I've seen in a long time so good thing it's a three
7684600	7688620	day weekend how we got plenty more show to come including your calls some news about
7688620	7693460	resistance persona for a Super Mario Brothers and portal crossover game that's gonna be
7693460	7698380	very interesting and your tweets at twitter.com slash olr as well as your emails at mailbag
7698380	7708940	orange laundry calm when we come back after this break with more of orange lounge radio
7708940	7714100	welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio we are live here on this Sunday evening September
7714100	7722380	4th of 2011 Labor Day weekend with the 426th episode of our program we're gonna we're running
7722380	7726780	long to a little long tonight part a was about two hours I don't think part b will be quite
7726780	7731420	as long and we had a late start life tonight too which I know doesn't affect the podcast
7731420	7735700	ease but good thing it's a three day weekend let's just put it that way we don't have to
7735700	7739380	get up early for work tomorrow during the break I had walked out in the living room
7739380	7743580	and I watched Dan was watching some playthroughs on YouTube which I thought was kind of neat
7743580	7749380	he was watching a Zelda link to the past which is a classic from the Super Nintendo days
7749380	7753100	we need to really have a retro night back at the house salacious pop and play something
7753100	7758540	retro and play through like I always kind of thought like I don't want to say it's weird
7758540	7762080	to like watch playthroughs because I get the allure of that you know like who doesn't like
7762080	7766140	to sit and watch someone else play a video game and the Internet's made that very interesting
7766140	7769340	where you can kind of do all that through YouTube and so forth but I don't know I like
7769340	7773340	to kind of get my hands on and play and all that stuff and so I kind of want to do a play
7773340	7777740	through Super Metroid or something retro I'd love to record a let's play and put on YouTube
7777740	7782580	but I do not have the attention span you don't have the attention to that you too this was
7782580	7790420	a short game 30 hours of let's play of Tetris you know I did a four block we're done we
7790420	7793960	could do a let's play you want to do a let's play we'll do that someday it'd be fun pick
7793960	7797340	a game that's only a couple hours we could do Metroid one I could be Metroid one and
7797340	7802660	about if I kind of remind what I'd have to do is I have to play through it the day before
7802660	7806240	and then I could do a play through the night of and once I kind of remember where everything's
7806240	7809860	at least one of those things you never forget but like you kind of want to play it one time
7809860	7813500	refresh your memory I could probably play through it in a couple hours once I just kind
7813500	7818260	of remember where everything's at you know that amnesia game that's big on steam oh god
7818260	7822700	where if you if you are in pitch blackness you go crazy and there's the scary monster
7822700	7828380	that you have to hide from it the let's play of though of that of that game are hilarious
7828380	7833580	because there are people that are just like in tears hiding in the closet scary it's a
7833580	7837420	scary it's a scary and the for the people that record commentary of that what they're
7837420	7842660	doing in the game amnesia let's plays look for the one on YouTube that has a couple hundred
7842660	7848100	thousand hits and you will laugh because this poor man he's he thinks that he's really dying
7848100	7852780	in real life he's very scared I need to find some sound clips from some of those and play
7852780	7856440	them on the show I bet they're hilarious they're like the reaction videos to two two girls
7856440	7865620	one cup right something like that all right let's move on with some rapid fire news and
7865620	7870740	we'll start off with Loki can I give us some quick news yes there's some rumors I mean
7870740	7874380	this is kind of a given that there will be like an epic Mickey tube something did pretty
7874380	7879320	well but coming from a really I thought it didn't do too well from what I heard it pretty
7879320	7885860	well for a Wii game all right of course there there's some surveys going around asking people
7885860	7892460	what their preferred packaging for epic Mickey to would be and a little bit because some
7892460	7899500	details are kind of derived based on that apparently epic Mickey to will feature Oswald
7899500	7907380	the lucky rabbit as well it almost looks like as another playable character and you know
7907380	7911540	looks like it that they may do some sort of split screen with that as well and it looks
7911540	7919100	like that Oswald can use his ears is kind of like a helicopter no real word of course
7919100	7926100	you know one I'm sure this is maybe like a 2012 holiday game if it's being worked on
7926100	7934220	right now but they're probably not happy that this leaked if it is holiday 2012 yes so yeah
7934220	7937300	I mean it's definitely something that they're working on could it be something where they're
7937300	7940900	just gauging interest and it may not actually be being made at all or do you think something
7940900	7945300	like this happens I mean because games aren't developed overnight so maybe this one of those
7945300	7949740	things where the games are ready in development it's like you know I don't know about that
7949740	7953820	I would think they're actually working on it says like the the screenshot that they
7953820	7958940	have is now we would like to show you a few more packages for Disney's epic Mickey to
7958940	7963900	video game please indicate which package design makes you most interested in purchasing Disney
7963900	7970060	epic Mickey to I think the third one is the best out of those I agree with you yes which
7970060	7974660	is just the two guys kind of it's not really an action shot everything else is an action
7974660	7978740	shot and that except that second one where they're kind of jumping off into the two you
7978740	7982900	can't really see their faces which is a little weird to me yeah I don't like the best shot
7982900	7990260	third one's pretty good yeah here we are taking the survey all right what else this is kind
7990260	7995740	of cool apparently cat or was it mad cats has announced that they're going to be doing
7995740	8001660	some official licensed major league gaming controllers now normally if it were the case
8001660	8006540	of you know the major league gaming I wouldn't give a shit about it and their fight stick
8006540	8010360	it's expensive it just looks like one of the normal mad cats fight sticks that they put
8010360	8014820	out for you know a street fighter or something like that that's fine but what makes me interested
8014820	8019900	though is actually their controller the controller that they've got out yes it's wired but it's
8019900	8023620	got a neat bunch of neat features like for example you're able to swap out the analog
8023620	8030500	sticks if you want and you can swap them between basically the playstation 3 and the xbox 360
8030500	8037300	ones also you'll be able to swap out the d-pad and you can put in either playstation 3 or
8037300	8042940	you know the 360 d-pad that is awesome whoa whoa whoa whoa so I could have playstation
8042940	8054420	3 controls on my 360 yes style controls I'm just I'm a little bit flabbergasted I'm partially
8054420	8059700	kind of like why haven't we seen this before like the 360 would be great if it had the
8059700	8065140	playstation 3's controller yeah and it also includes placement so like for example you
8065140	8070760	could put you know the analog sticks you can move them around or whatever if you want really
8070760	8075580	Dan's saying they used to make a controller like that I just don't even remember old school
8075580	8079900	playstation era no prices have been announced yet but these controllers include the base
8079900	8085900	controller two pro module d-pads one that's you know like the xbox 360 one that's like
8085900	8091380	the playstation 3 for analog sticks you know two that are like the 360 to they're like
8091380	8098620	the ps3 two faceplates a matte finish or glossy finish a braided three meter cable that actually
8098620	8102960	screws onto the controller integrated weight compartment so you can adjust the weights
8102960	8108440	on there it's getting more expensive and pro case that the whole thing is stored in plus
8108440	8114420	they're saying that they're gonna be able to sell additional add-ons later on like customize
8114420	8120860	you know analog how much they haven't said I do know that the fight stick is like 150
8120860	8128120	bucks so I would hope that this is around the same price as a regular controller although
8128120	8133140	I'd imagine it's probably around like 70 80 bucks yeah I was gonna say that looks 69.99
8133140	8139060	right there that's not bad if it's 69.99 because regular controllers are 60 bucks so 10 bucks
8139060	8144400	extra yeah that might be worth it yeah I'm uh yeah yeah and dark tattoo is in our chat
8144400	8150140	room see saying see I thought Rob might like this considering the 360s d-pad is ass exactly
8150140	8158100	I I do like this actually interesting all right all right and then last but not least
8158100	8163620	dance central to the announced some tracks for that and actually some of these are pretty
8163620	8170660	awesome they had a way what is love oh my god yes it's awesome that by the that's that
8170660	8174140	song from the club guys the Saturday night live the night at the Roxbury that's what's

8181980	8190080	mix not really sure what that is Bobby about my prerogative Curtis blow the brakes and
8190080	8196580	a sure featuring little John and ludicrous yeah so not bad it's got a pretty kick-ass
8196580	8201060	song list so far definitely interested in this game no surprise there had a way was
8201060	8205520	love that's gonna be easiest routine ever can't wait just pop your head back and forth
8205520	8210080	that had if that's not in there this whole this whole game is a sham and I'm gonna write
8210080	8213980	harmonics and tell them so they've got a head no head bobbing and what is love your game
8213980	8219260	is they've got to have that at least in part of it I mean come on you gotta that it's only
8219260	8224340	that song famous it wasn't the song itself right right all right well I got some news

8236420	8241820	so maybe I don't think that was in dance I don't think it's just dance damn it all right
8241820	8247060	there's going to be a $70 Zelda Skyward Sword bundle and it comes with the Wii remote plus
8247060	8252060	it's a gold one that's good for those that never did buy a Wii remote plus including
8252060	8255500	myself I never bothered with the attachment or anything but this is one of those like
8255500	8260380	all-in-one Wii controllers so IDK I might have to pick this up I'm not sure yet I'm
8260380	8264540	still not kind of sure how I feel about Zelda Skyward Sword but you do you have to have
8264540	8269180	the Wii motion plus you really should get one of those I don't know if I'd spend the
8269180	8274340	extra money well it's not bad I mean the controller itself is gonna be what 40 so I might as well
8274340	8278420	get the game I just bought Wii motion pluses so you know a big deal my controllers a little
8278420	8284060	longer now just so you know it also comes with a CD from the Zelda 25th anniversary
8284060	8289380	concert this all comes out on November 20th they are saying that the initial print of
8289380	8294860	both the Wii controller and just the regular game by itself will have the CD that's pretty
8294860	8300620	cool and the gold the gold wiimotes kind of neat I guess if you're into color collecting
8300620	8305060	burnout crash coming out of Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and the date has been
8305060	8310260	set September 20th and that'll set you back either 800 Microsoft points which is 10 bucks
8310260	8316900	or $9.99 on PlayStation Network so you can save a whole penny radiant silver gun is coming
8316900	8322220	to Xbox Live Arcade and it's been dated for September 14th 1200 Microsoft points that's
8322220	8327100	15 bucks no word on a PlayStation Network version but yeah it's it's not just a port
8327100	8331760	I believe this is like a little remake it's gonna have an online two-player co-op Saturn
8331760	8338900	and arcade style game variants different graphical modes an Ikaruga scoring system it's gonna
8338900	8344820	say that was a big Saturn game when the Saturn tried to you know survive here and I think
8344820	8349500	that's a former or previous class game of the week oh I'm sure I'm sure Jamie probably
8349500	8353860	has highlighted every treasure made game at some point so radiant silver gun on Xbox Live
8353860	8360020	Arcade I know anybody who's a fan of shooters at all has got to be at least a little curious
8360020	8365980	about this if not just downright excited so all right let's move on slice pop professor
8365980	8373340	Layton for we're getting it we're getting it soon we're getting it in October it is
8373340	8379480	called professor Layton and the last specter it is the fourth game in the series it was
8379480	8384620	just announced that we're getting it on the 3ds even though it's not technically a 3ds
8384620	8391380	game on October 17th and it's at the Japanese version of the game came out with a little
8391380	8396580	sort of Gaiden side story thing within this within the same cartridge called professor
8396580	8401460	Layton's London life RPG we are getting that as well translated so we're getting the bonus
8401460	8413940	game along with the proper sequel this October and also in a quickfire news we have a bundle

8446900	8451540	correctly yeah I'm not seeing a date on this story going out of me but yeah if you loved
8451540	8458380	rez which is an amazing music and special effects game child of Eden it believe it or
8458380	8464980	not is easier to play with a controller but seeing how so yeah seeing how the Kinect interface
8464980	8469780	interfaces with the game is neat but yeah so the Kinect is getting the bundle game child
8469780	8474900	of Eden soon I talked about this when I first reviewed child of Eden but I honestly think
8474900	8482140	it's going to be better on the move but that's just me yeah and finally let's see if I can
8482140	8490980	pronounce this right d3 is coming out with new Oni Chimbara Oni Chimbara thank you game
8490980	8499100	basically you are bikini clad Japanese school girls it looks like it's kind of a like a
8499100	8505380	bastard on Dreamcast or Devil May Cry slasher game very gory you're basically bikini school
8505380	8511060	girls killing zombies and when you kill a zombie blood everywhere blood splash oh god
8511060	8518900	so much blood bikini and a cowboy hat yep and where it's an Xbox exclusive game coming

8531300	8536980	we'll get the sequel here and babes killing zombies what's not to love and they're the
8536980	8539980	first game is kind of lame but the second one looks a little bit better because it's
8539980	8543540	not just zombies you're fighting it's like actual monsters and stuff so it looks a little
8543540	8551260	bit like a little bit like bullet which but not quite as cool all right I want to throw
8551260	8556540	one more plug for the upcoming indie segment here on the show I'm was finally go figure
8556540	8559380	the week we're not here I'm finally getting some bites on this so I think we're ready
8559380	8563900	to roll this out next week but I do want to say one more time before we roll out the segment
8563900	8568140	if you have an indie game if you're developing one or you know people who are and they could
8568140	8572940	be for a PC it could be for Xbox Live any arcade it could be iOS I don't really care
8572940	8577060	as long as you're independent we want to feature more independent games here on the show after
8577060	8581460	all we are an independent podcast so reach me at rob at orange laundry.com or of course
8581460	8584980	you know I send it to the general mailbag as well mailbag at orange laundry.com or use
8584980	8589180	the contact us forum on the site I don't really care just get in touch with us if you think
8589180	8593300	your game is worthy of being highlighted on the show in a new segment that I really hope
8593300	8598020	will start next week because I did get several interested people like it's when it rains
8598020	8601780	it pours right I wasn't getting anything for a couple weeks and a lot last week so I'm
8601780	8608140	really excited so we'll be getting into that very soon also one more plug for tweets tonight
8608140	8615020	twitter.com slash o l r we'll be getting to those shortly but first couple more stories
8615020	8620260	according to Howard Stringer he is saying that the PlayStation Network is bouncing back
8620260	8628900	way Howard Stern the stock shock jock DJ Stringer Oh Stringer not Stern he is basically saying
8628900	8633380	the PlayStation Network is more secure and better than ever and added that the company
8633380	8638460	is working to expand the service which has added three million new customers since the
8638460	8650740	attack and sales have actually increased relative to the pre-attack levels so interesting told
8650740	8660260	you people would forget about it in a few months yeah well that's very not surprising
8660260	8664900	that everybody's going to forgive and forget after a few months except maybe those people
8664900	8671180	who sold back their systems in a fit I don't know but I you know what I honestly think
8671180	8675180	might be happening I think people stole all the Sony information has been using it to
8675180	8680020	hack the Xboxes like I think that's why the Xbox like I could swear I had different passwords
8680020	8684940	on 360 and PlayStation Network but now I'm thinking maybe I didn't and maybe that's how
8684940	8693060	my Xbox was hacked I don't know but just interesting so all right anyhow story for you guys about
8693060	8696420	something that was announced at E3 this year that had a lot of people very excited it was
8696420	8701660	the PlayStation 3D display bundle yes remember when they were going to be selling the monitor
8701660	8706420	with resistance 3 for $4.99 but then when they were like actually we're not gonna put
8706420	8710460	resistance 3 in there we're gonna put a motor storm apocalypse in there and some retailers
8710460	8714140	were like well fuck you we're gonna be of resistance 3 anyway so that way they pre-order
8714140	8721500	with us well actually this is interesting Sony has apparently made this their plan the
8721500	8728340	whole time resistance 3 is going to be included with any 3d display that was pre-ordered before
8728340	8735280	September 30th motor storm though will be included no matter what so that's why Walmart
8735280	8739780	Amazon and GameStop were putting out all these deals I guess the whole time Sony was like
8739780	8744780	yeah you can offer this deal and so it was to look like a pre-order I don't know is it
8744780	8749100	a brilliant marketing scheme or do you feel a little used or and who cares it's just a
8749100	8755660	TV I don't think it's selling as well as they'd hoped really well come on it's a $499 piece
8755660	8761340	of yeah but it's 3d and it comes with two games it's 24 inch it's not that bad that's
8761340	8765500	perfect for like a dorm room I would love yes in college for a dorm room but then you
8765500	8771620	gotta buy another pair of glasses if you wanna you know it it's expensive and there's a small
8771620	8777020	part of me that's interested but then I go but if I kick down like another $300 I could
8777020	8780120	just get like a large 3d they're just trying to they're just trying to get you to buy now
8780120	8783620	but then you wait wait just a little longer and you can get like you're gonna be able
8783620	8791940	to get a you know full-size HDTV that supports 3d you know for less money and think of how
8791940	8796020	fast the technology is evolving I mean right now they have they're trying to sell us on
8796020	8799820	these active shutter glasses which I've used them and they gave you a headache and they
8799820	8804940	don't have Sony TV too but just wait until they've come out with some technology where
8804940	8808540	well they already have it out but you know where it becomes more mainstream where it's
8808540	8815060	either the non shutter glasses because each one of those is fucking $70 $70 for a pair
8815060	8819780	of glasses wow when you can you know I hope they got that the technology that they use
8819780	8826540	for you know the Disney stuff or whatever and in theaters with those cheap ass $5 glasses
8826540	8832660	you know that's what needs to become mainstream yeah so I can't steal a pair of glasses from
8832660	8836500	the theaters and use them on these TVs oh yeah cuz no they're active shutter no but
8836500	8843220	it's not what the fucking like Sega Master System used that's what all the old 3d systems
8843220	8850720	used it was active shutter technology you know even way back to the Vectrex was active
8850720	8859580	shutter you know the old school 3d stuff in IMAX was active shutter stuff but what they
8859580	8864900	need if they just you know really adopt that format with those cheaper glasses I think
8864900	8868900	that'd be the way to go because then it's not a big deal to get I think people will
8868900	8871460	be more interested in that it's like okay I only have to drop money on this it's like
8871460	8876180	well if I want to watch 3d my family I've got to drop you know another I had to buy
8876180	8884100	another four pairs of glasses and there's another $300 hmm I don't know slices pop what
8884100	8889900	do you think about these TVs do you think this is something I should get for the house
8889900	8894340	knowing us we'll just save up and go to fries and get the real the real deal we don't need
8894340	8897900	the TV we don't need the starter kit I guess that's true that's kind of where I'm at with
8897900	8903680	this so all right for college kids I guess if you're in college did you need a 3d TV
8903680	8907940	that will fit in a door I need a 3d TV in my dorm room amongst all the college expenses
8907940	8912300	well hey you know what my Super Nintendo and it wasn't that wasn't even the cutting edge
8912300	8917060	thing Nintendo's the the kids upstairs had a Nintendo 64 and they were like the most
8917060	8921340	popular kids in the dorm but I was probably second popular with my Mario Kart nights in
8921340	8925660	the dorm room yeah and Duke Nukem 3d I mean just wait I mean if they're putting out if
8925660	8931900	Sony is able to put out a monitor for $499 and Sony I mean they're known for being pretty
8931900	8937220	high and as far as price points go on their products just wait there's gonna be they're
8937220	8942540	gonna be able to do that I just the right now people aren't putting out 3d TVs that
8942540	8947580	are 24 inches because who the fuck's gonna buy that I mean if you're gonna buy an HD
8947580	8951620	TV and have a 3d it's gonna be something that's being you know used in your living room you're
8951620	8956780	gonna want it to be pretty big so if there's a demand for it people put it out and they'll
8956780	8961460	put it out cheaper and it'll be better technology so just wait you don't need to jump in the
8961460	8967300	3d right away all right let's visit the mailbag and see what you guys think after all we are
8967300	8971340	the show where every gamer has a voice I'd like to share your voices not just through

8975020	8980420	place you can send us emails to get your longer thoughts out more than 140 characters and
8980420	8984340	salacious pop sitting in for trying to fill Jamie's shoes tonight it's gonna go ahead
8984340	8992220	and take over the mailbag okay our first email tonight is from Oscar and he writes I wasn't
8992220	8999020	drunk Oscar I swear haha hi guys hugs I miss you all and it's been a while since I wrote
8999020	9003940	in so here goes first off as you saw on Twitter I was in Disney World for a week and just
9003940	9008860	returned on Monday the 22nd I remember Rob mentioning something about electronica in
9008860	9014420	Disneyland and being the huge fan that I am of Tron legacy I was looking forward to seeing
9014420	9019180	something like that at Disney World it turns out that there was nothing Tron related there
9019180	9023660	other than some blu-ray discs of the movie on some store shelves what exactly did I miss
9023660	9029540	out on Tron was on the monorail for a short time but nothing but a painting really Disney
9029540	9034260	World they didn't do anything for Tron there it's true also I've always wondered why there
9034260	9039980	isn't a Kingdom Hearts attraction at any of the parks probably because it's I'm wondering
9039980	9045060	that too that's a brilliant question I it's like Disney refuses to acknowledge it maybe
9045060	9050540	because it's a more square you probably have to share the characters money royalties with
9050540	9056180	square well first off I think funny that he brought up electronica it makes me feel justified
9056180	9059540	for the 10-minute tangent in part a but I think we kind of covered it in part a so I
9059540	9062660	don't think I need to elaborate further but as far as Kingdom Hearts I will tell you the
9062660	9068900	one thing one thing do two things I've ever seen Kingdom Hearts related in the park once
9068900	9073700	I was a store called off the page in California adventure and now I go there every time because
9073700	9077940	when I was there once I saw a Sora figurine and it was one of those like nice ceramic
9077940	9081620	figurines going for like a hundred bucks like it was that type of quality like a ceramic
9081620	9086060	doll and I really wish I bought it and I regret not buying it and that's the only thing
9086060	9091020	Kingdom Hearts related I've ever seen in the park besides number two some parents drop
9091020	9095420	brought their little kid once dressed to Sora and I saw them standing in line for the haunted
9095420	9098500	mansion they were from Australia you know how sometimes little kids want to dress up
9098500	9101700	and big kids can't dress up by the way they don't let you in Disneyland you have to be
9101700	9106500	like seven or under if you want to wear a costume unless it's Halloween and you're at
9106500	9111020	the Halloween party but we saw some Australian parents bring in their like six-year-old in
9111020	9116040	a Sora costume and it was adorable and even if you ask a Disney cast member that's working
9116040	9123060	at those memorabilia stores that are really into Disney lore they never really heard of
9123060	9127420	Kingdom Hearts it's not on the radar for a lot of Disney employees it's a shame. Dark
9127420	9132780	Tetsuya says there was a Sora statue in interventions and that I wouldn't you know I don't go in
9132780	9137700	interventions a lot I gotta be honest interventions kind of weak and they really need to convert
9137700	9143100	the building into something interesting but I wouldn't be surprised that they had a nod
9143100	9146460	to Sora in there as well especially because last time I was in there which is a couple
9146460	9151840	years ago they had Xbox 360 units that were the exact same things that were on the E3
9151840	9159140	show floor earlier that year so you know that's they get some use out of those year-round.
9159140	9162420	Does no one else think that a ride of some sort would be pretty awesome again this is
9162420	9167540	in regards to Kingdom Hearts or is it just something that Square Enix is holding back
9167540	9173460	on for when they launch their own amusement park smirk or sigh I guess my dream shall
9173460	9180020	suffice for now. I would assume Disney Sea in Tokyo has more but that's of course a huge
9180020	9183460	assumption and I don't really know I would have to rely on a Japanese listener who maybe
9183460	9187460	has been there to tell me if Kingdom Hearts has more of a presence there I'm assuming
9187460	9191900	but I could be wrong. Secondly while I do think that sending bees to Nintendo would
9191900	9197520	be pretty amusing I cannot do so due to me being absolutely terrified of them maybe Operation
9197520	9202460	Rainfall members can send bottles of their tears instead. I like that. Was it a campaign
9202460	9207260	to send bees to Nintendo? It was on the show a couple weeks ago. And I'm going to end this
9207260	9212420	email with one last question regarding 3DS colors. You guys mentioned that the flare
9212420	9217300	red 3DS would be coming out in the US in early September. The thing is I'm holding out for
9217300	9222220	the release of the purple 3DS that was shown on the floor at E3. That thing looked freaking
9222220	9228860	beautiful and he included a link to it and it does it's a gorgeous sexy it's very Prince
9228860	9235180	Joker shade of deep purple like yeah it's like the cool purple it's a metallic purple
9235180	9240180	not like the like girl it's not let's not lavender it is that's a kid at Chris color
9240180	9245340	if I ever saw one I and I didn't you know and I was at E3 that year to have an eggplant
9245340	9252020	purple right there eggplant wizard yeah like that I I wish I remembered seeing that because
9252020	9258340	that is a sexy 3DS well I may consider getting the flare red system is there any word on
9258340	9261940	more colors coming out in the near future no they've announced anything other than the
9261940	9266100	flare red one and they're not going to I just wait for them wait their announcement yeah
9266100	9270500	wait for that Tokyo event because that could be but that's you know that's probably gonna
9270500	9278100	be more Japan but you never know I would still say hold out until after the Tokyo event which
9278100	9284500	won't be that long after the flare red DS is out anyway 3DS is out anyway besides you
9284500	9289620	probably want to hold out anyways until you know more games come out because they could
9289620	9293460	and I hope they don't do it but they could very well even though they've been saying
9293460	9298500	Mario Mario 3d land and Mario Kart and be out this year they could very well go up that's
9298500	9303980	next year now you watch it could it could well they haven't said anything yet makes
9303980	9311460	me wonder thank you as always for reading Oscar so that's the first email next we have
9311460	9316540	and I I really don't want to be rude to this person this was written in by Holly Holly
9316540	9323700	D the first or the two-thirds of the email is basically just a verbatim talking about
9323700	9330100	the Deus Ex GameStop removing the code controversy so the first 30 minutes of this show sure
9330100	9334900	is really for you Holly sure I'm not going to read it just because it's it's literally
9334900	9341060	just saying what happened and how there was a leaked memo and blah blah blah so the commentary
9341060	9346680	seriously I've been off GameStop for a while but I still went in and look now and then
9346680	9351020	and I still considered buying things from there but coupled with what sky has been saying
9351020	9356900	lately in this referring to the code scandal with Deus Ex well this is the final straw
9356900	9366180	no more now now it's power gamer Best Buy or online retailers GameStop can stop it yeah
9366180	9370500	I mean we kind of talked to death about it the first 30 minutes of the show but I think
9370500	9375660	what Holly saying in her email echoes what quite a few people are thinking this week
9375660	9381140	it will be interesting I would like to go back and ask these people in a year did you
9381140	9387420	stick with it I would ask myself that near to did I stick with it or did I break down
9387420	9391340	because GameStop had some stupid exclusive that I had to have I'm trying to think get
9391340	9396500	a Skyrim exclusive I'm gonna be so goddamn I don't remember the last time I ever I was
9396500	9402580	in a GameStop me neither for anything I think I remember the last game I look when we go
9402580	9406780	in the mall I'm not gonna you know I we've gone in the mall and looked but it's more
9406780	9410740	of a well what's what's new what's I forget what games are out you know even though I
9410740	9414820	do this show sometimes I forget I think the last time I was in there well one times I
9414820	9422860	remember was when I was picking up extra copies of episodes from Liberty City just to stock
9422860	9428340	the other machines we have but I don't think I don't think I bought a new game from them
9428340	9435860	for a long time I don't remember the last thing I bought at one do you I don't remember
9435860	9440860	usually when we go in it's to see what they what obscure thing that they have for 360
9440860	9444340	or ps3 that's used at a decent price and usually oh that's price too high for a used game and
9444340	9448740	we leave mm-hmm I still have a gift card there it's like that same story every time isn't
9448740	9454180	it I like their magazine and sometimes we're just fucking bored and you want to go window
9454180	9458460	shop you know like even though everything I said about the place is just kind of whatever
9458460	9462340	it's here let's just go in and look I'm not gonna buy anything but I'll look and sometimes
9462340	9467020	you know and then this goes for a lot of places they may have good deals on like rock band
9467020	9471700	equipment or something like that if you need some of that I mean because it's so dirt cheap
9471700	9482100	nowadays okay and our final email is from Chiggers this is sent through our comment
9482100	9488180	system on the site reading an article recently on IGN entitled what games have taught me
9488180	9493580	and it got me thinking about historical facts in games as a way of teaching kids they referred
9493580	9498860	to one nest game at North and South which I which I have as an example can you think
9498860	9503700	of any other more recent games that have historical facts and whether or not you think it would
9503700	9508260	be used more in today's games as a teaching tool I can think of like God a war would be
9508260	9515260	good for like mythology I mean well you know it makes a stretch but okay no I won't be
9515260	9521540	right we're aware of like you know what different gods were Titans were the pantheon is accurate
9521540	9526540	Athena Aries that's all all the edutainment games that I think of that I learned shit
9526540	9531120	from is obviously very old and dated I think of Oregon Trail Carmen San Diego number munchers
9531120	9535780	absolutely Carmen San Diego math blasters but all that shit's old but at the same time
9535780	9541260	actually a lot of that shit is still around like I believe math blasters still exist in
9541260	9546720	some form I want to say Oregon trails been working trails been remade now it's a Facebook
9546720	9552000	game and kids have that on 3ds right now this year yeah so a lot of those games actually
9552000	9556240	still exist like they've been updating them forget we just don't follow them because we're
9556240	9563060	not six or seven anymore except the occasional retro cool oh lol Oregon Trail on Facebook
9563060	9567680	ha ha ha I made slashes pop die of dysentery right like that's that's about the extent
9567680	9571520	of it but who really sits down to play an edutainment game I don't think I learned anything
9571520	9577980	from Oregon Trail you learned that if you killed 4,000 pounds of Buffalo you can only
9577980	9584020	take 10 pounds of it back I learned that that was fun yes you learned where what where where
9584020	9590540	did where does the Oregon Trail start yeah independence Missouri and that's why I remember
9590540	9595260	that from the game see I learned nothing from the Oregon Trail of course I hope I got that
9595260	9598380	right or I'm gonna sound hella stupid I guess I didn't learn anything for the Oregon Trail
9598380	9605460	whatsoever it starts in Florida no I'm not I need to click on this IGN article and see
9605460	9609380	what what's actually being quoted here but I'll come on you know there's nothing valuable
9609380	9618800	there for those that played Bioshock the first one the whole story of rapture the under under
9618800	9625220	the sea city was based off of and Rand the fountainhead Atlas shrugged the objectivism
9625220	9630460	approach to politics which is some pretty highbrow adult concepts you wouldn't really
9630460	9636100	know who and Rand is from playing that game but the antagonist was Andrew Ryan obviously
9636100	9643180	a play on her name so that was a game developer saying let's take this whole you know way
9643180	9647340	of thinking that a lot of adults you apply to their politics and make a video game based
9647340	9652540	on based on it I don't know that that was kind of an intellectual angle for a game did
9652540	9656900	you play Bioshock did you pick up on any of that I played a little bit of it but I more
9656900	9661460	picked up because I didn't get to that killer twist ending that everybody talks about because
9661460	9665700	I'm terrible at first-person shooters I was more like wow this game is really good-looking
9665700	9670580	great game yeah I know I know well here's the thing now that you just told me that if
9670580	9674520	I wait for Bioshock infinite on PlayStation 3 I can get the first game for free yeah that's
9674520	9681420	like in a year it's over a year from now dude just seriously is played is there a skill
9681420	9685620	level where like any dope can get through yeah you can play it on easy okay yeah and
9685620	9689980	is it like you pray where you never die that's the only reason I could play okay you die
9689980	9694700	fucking die but there's respawn points and it's not like you're dead forever I mean all
9694700	9700140	right I could do that yeah and steam has had like Bioshock what to on sale for eight bucks
9700140	9704540	you get one free two I wasn't a big fan of although I should really go back and play
9704540	9711380	it but one was great it was a great game that's why I'm so for infinite looks it looks great
9711380	9717660	I just can't wait to play it didn't the romancing the throne games talk about like the empires
9717660	9723780	of China and Mongolia and all that those words that historical yes but a great comment from
9723780	9726980	somebody who just joined our chat room but didn't change their nickname so it's just
9726980	9733500	anonymous person in chat says the civilization series excellent point the Civ series are

9779940	9783820	I just talked about that my freaking week civilization games absolutely you learn about
9783820	9788060	some of the great leaders and you know sometimes there sometimes the units that they get that
9788060	9793580	are special talk about their culture or kind of something to that culture you know you're
9793580	9797900	not going to learn detailed facts but sometimes you're playing scenarios and things like that
9797900	9802460	and maybe even that's a great answer maybe some of the World War II like Call of Duty
9802460	9806460	games or a battlefield games from you may learn a little bit about history and stuff
9806460	9816060	there hmm all right moving on let's talk about the F use of the week oh every week here on

9852860	9859860	goddamn world I fucking have to learn that shit this week and it was boring as hell it's
9859860	9866160	like libraries are so fucking old school get with the times they have to like it's ridiculous
9866160	9871260	all the crap that they break down about each individual thing and mainly I was looking
9871260	9876440	for DVDs and games but oh my god is boring and I had to learn the Dewey decimal system
9876440	9879580	for a little bit which actually Dewey decimal system isn't as complicated as I thought which
9879580	9885100	is great but I still don't care so fuck you though slashes pop do you have any F use the
9885100	9893140	week this might be taking from your F use but F you to giant huge spiders that like

10038860	10045620	I was supposed to get up at 9 a.m. but I set my alarm on a weekday alarm on my iPhone the
10045620	10049060	same one as my work alarm you know something's just changed the time on the alarm I'm not
10049060	10052580	thinking it yeah I was only set for weekdays you're supposed to meet some people for brunch
10052580	10057060	at 10 30 we go to gay brunch every Sunday I try to I get a text message at 10 20 we
10057060	10062900	have a table it's in the back but the text message woke me up to a off fuck like this
10062900	10068340	I think that's what you heard this morning right that's what you woke up to yeah oops
10068340	10072940	so if you to myself so yeah we had to flake and say that we are lazy slugs and we we slept
10072940	10078180	and I missed brunch the sound of gay man judgment coming through the phone you could just you
10078180	10088100	could just feel it you know you know what I'm talking about all right now moving on
10088100	10093780	more news stories and then the Twitter and skype line coming up at 1 877 game olr toll-free
10093780	10104500	numbers back this week hooray so there's been a new break in the console hacking scene if
10104500	10111220	you will apparently there is now a new exploit called the reset glitch hack that allows any
10111220	10121220	Xbox 360 any from now before and in the future to be turned into a JTAG console period apparently
10121220	10128220	it is an exploit that cannot be patched and people have already found a way to that sounds
10128220	10133780	pretty definitive they've run away or found a way to load this program called Zell which
10133780	10139220	is kind of like a front end for they don't have any read was like rebooters yet which
10139220	10144140	means you can't run a custom firmware on it yet but right now you can launch homebrew
10144140	10149460	stuff and they have a video someone actually running a Nintendo 64 emulator on their slim
10149460	10156780	and already different people out there and you know the mod scene of already created
10156780	10162020	new tools to enable people to do that so it's a matter of time before the JTAG prices drop
10162020	10171020	and people will be able to do more crazy homebrew stuff or piracy I guess you know a lot of
10171020	10175700	people are using for piracy well at least right now there's no way to take JTAGs online
10175700	10181740	without them being banned immediately once people figure a way around that then yeah
10181740	10192220	so it's interesting you have a JTAG so it doesn't matter I don't know I'm just I don't
10192220	10196660	know like it's it's I talked about this on the last show which is two weeks ago about
10196660	10200820	when I talked about how I finally did the Wii because joystick put the instructions
10200820	10204260	up that made it look so easy and it's kind of like you know I have to really have a reason
10204260	10207940	to do it and now my reason for at least the Wii is being able to play shit that Nintendo
10207940	10213180	won't release in this country it's kind of nice so I don't know I don't have a reason
10213180	10221060	yet to do that to my 360 but well my 360 I use a lot for editing Grand Theft Auto so
10221060	10225380	I use it to test stuff instead of having the burn discs every time it's back in the day
10225380	10229940	when I first started doing Grand Theft Auto mods I did have the burn discs every time
10229940	10235620	and I had a stack of discs that were just ridiculous so it does save me a lot of money
10235620	10240660	in that sense plus you can do mods and trainers and stuff like that on games and it's kind
10240660	10247000	of fun alright moving on to a game series that I'm sure a lot of people are very excited
10247000	10250300	about this is going to be a system seller I'm not even kidding for the PlayStation Vita
10250300	10257500	a lot of people are going to be excited about this Persona 4 Persona 4 now this was already
10257500	10262260	a PlayStation 2 game but they are going to be actually making a portable port of this
10262260	10267140	it's going to be out in Japan in 2012 they're going to be enhancing some things new animation

10271940	10276460	you're about to die in a dungeon and so forth crazy also announced however which is very
10276460	10283060	interesting a Persona fighting game it's by Arc System Works you know them Blazblue right
10283060	10288660	it's Persona 4 the ultimate in my account my Onaka arena it's going to hit arcades in
10288660	10293140	spring of 2012 apparently PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions will come out later in the
10293140	10300180	summer so persona fans have a lot to be excited about so yeah I have persona 3 the hella edition
10300180	10305060	that came out for the ps2 because it came out twice persona 3 in the second edition
10305060	10308660	and then I hear that the PSP port of persona 3 that came out a year or two ago is even
10308660	10311900	better than that and aren't those games like I haven't gotten really into a lot of persona
10311900	10315660	games aren't they very big on like it's it's kind of like a do whatever you want type of
10315660	10320920	RPG isn't it some are a lot of them run on a like a calendar system where you do you
10320920	10326240	have a certain amount of time in a day to do something but persona 4 address some pretty
10326240	10332060	adult concepts that aren't really that controversial but they are because video games are for kids
10332060	10337660	of course that they handled very maturely and I'm glad that that content is there but
10337660	10341480	yeah and I have persona 4 for the ps2 I didn't know that collector's edition yet said it's

10556660	10561020	always a fucking risotto there's always a fucking like chicken there's always a fish
10561020	10566140	entree it's always the same goddamn thing just learn how to cook that you're done you're
10566140	10570980	set you're gonna have your own fucking restaurant and don't talk back I think you need to go
10570980	10576020	on Hell's Kitchen I don't know how to cook although if I did I would learn how to cook
10576020	10580100	the risotto and cook all that shit and they way he's like he's all this is what risotto
10580100	10583020	supposed to taste like that's right bitch that's right you should have done it this

10589060	10593740	though I'd talk to the other people that when you piss them off I love the stunt cake shows
10593740	10598980	where they have to make this huge SpongeBob SquarePants with like a fucking Ferris wheel
10598980	10604500	and like a waterfall you know Food Network challenge or whatever it's always it's always
10604500	10608580	a cake once they replace the host and host is terrible and it's it's always awesome when
10608580	10612100	because they have to carry it from the kitchen to the judgment table sometimes the whole
10612100	10616620	thing was fucking fall over there's $300 a cake on the floor there are two Food Network
10616620	10619820	shows I can actually watch one of them is the old-school Iron Chef from Japan which
10619820	10625180	I don't even think they show anymore on food TV or it's a the cooking channel now and then
10625180	10630060	I watch I can watch Unwrapped with Mark Summers because Mark Summers I was really in a Top
10630060	10637660	Chef until I got to replace of it replays are no new shows oh that's a bummer easy thing
10637660	10644120	yeah I watched a ton of Food Network a ton of food when I lived with him Nelly would
10644120	10647780	come over and they would watch Food Network like that's how I got to watching some of
10647780	10651060	these shows because I just be kind of sitting there I go I fucking food looks so fucking
10651060	10656740	good oh my god oh my god this shows about oh my god it's an unwrapped on Pringles died
10656740	10660940	what to have and watch a lot of Food Network and it's great it's I like watching Chopped
10660940	10665140	because it's like a mini Iron Chef it's actually pretty good I like it's pretty cool hosted
10665140	10670240	by Ted Allen from your Queer Eye I really wish that shows on TV I love that show it's
10670240	10678480	sad it's gone I do I understand so my guilty pleasure shows are makeover shows I love makeover
10678480	10683780	shows you know it's not necessarily people makeover Loki is the straight one on the show
10683780	10690580	you know not necessarily people makeover shows it's like you know like the car makeover shows
10690580	10695180	you know like there's my ride there's a home there's a house makeover show I don't watch
10695180	10700140	that but but like they have a restaurant impossible now it's a restaurant makeover show do you
10700140	10706460	watch Extreme Makeover no did you watch The Swan no no I don't I don't watch the people
10706460	10712220	makeover so I like I like them like building stuff you know like I used to watch Junkyard
10712220	10716700	Wars and stuff like that you know stuff where they're taking a pit my rides kind of dumb
10716700	10721820	I mean they're like 50 TVs in there it doesn't make any sense but like I like watching them
10721820	10727900	you know do stuff to cars and like you remake them and stuff like I used to watch the the
10727900	10731980	Jesse James one or whatever monster garage and stuff like that you know those shows are
10731980	10738340	awesome yeah and Queer Eye was a good show I liked that show it was it was good you know
10738340	10742260	because the people that were on the show like the five guys that they had there were great
10742260	10745900	and now they have all their own stuff and Ted Allen's awesome he's one of the best people
10745900	10751840	on the show the Blondes on Dancing with the Stars Carson the blonde who was in charge
10751840	10757140	of clothes I think he's yeah he's on Dancing with the Stars and people it's so funny because
10757140	10760660	people are not even talking about like when Lance Bass a gay guy was on Dancing with the
10760660	10764020	Stars you know middle America was all oh my god I can't believe why don't they partner
10764020	10767580	you with another man it's so gross it's a family show like people aren't even fucking
10767580	10771560	talking about Carson because they totally upped the ante by putting a transgender person
10771560	10776140	on this year with Chaz Bono it's like no one no one cur that you're gay because we got
10776140	10781860	a transgender and they're oh my god it's ruining Americana and all this bullshit like just
10781860	10787120	how are we talking about before I don't remember now I don't know but my point is if Chaz
10787120	10795700	Bono wants to dance god damn it let him dance shut the fuck up just because you can't dance
10795700	10798620	and they'll have Gordon Ramsay come out and yell at him yes and that'll be that'll bring
10798620	10802860	it back to the top story there you go but I do I do hope Asa Case comes back this fall
10802860	10806820	because I miss that show the way it ties into video games is there's a fucking DS game for
10806820	10812740	every one of these goddamn shows we just mentioned Iron Chef and it was terrible yes I played
10812740	10816980	that at PAX one year it was it was better than Cooking Mama yeah but it ended up being
10816980	10824020	terrible all right can we move on low key with the gaming news story we can move on
10824020	10828580	EA is trying to downplay the whole origin exclusivity of their their titles they're
10828580	10833900	basically saying competition and choice go hand in hand so the fact that we only distribute
10833900	10841280	our own games on our own platform I don't see that he explained that basically the company
10841280	10845780	is in discussions with other publishers that have their games on origin but EA's key focus
10845780	10851340	is to develop an oppressive consumer experience where people are happy to play and buy game
10851340	10855420	you're just fucking competing with valve okay just stop dancing around it you're trying
10855420	10859660	to compete with valve and it's just an awkward situation because you publish valve games
10859660	10867460	as well so whatever so battlefield 3 won't be on there oh big big deal you know what
10867460	10875740	I don't care you know I heard a story later in the week though about I guess valve games
10875740	10882220	are now showing up on origin yeah the PC ones like the actual physical games that EA published
10882220	10893700	are showing up on their site but not any digital stuff all right one more story for you guys
10893700	10898700	Square Enix is going to be expanding and they're expanding Eidos Montreal they're going to
10898700	10904020	be adding 350 employees over the next few years up to 2015 of course they're not saying
10904020	10908740	exactly what it is they're developing they haven't really officially announced this either
10908740	10914260	but there's a report that's out there from la press affair it's a French name la press
10914260	10919700	a a fairies I don't know le press affair that talks about how they're going to double in
10919700	10923860	size and accommodate these employees their report says that a tentative agreement was
10923860	10931260	made between Eidos Square Enix and all that and investment Quebec that will give them
10931260	10936580	tax credits and a 2 million subsidy to square and you know I think this is important to
10936580	10942080	point out because with all these news of game studios closing and going under it's nice
10942080	10948700	to hear about some expanding isn't it Montreal Eidos I believe is making the fourth thief
10948700	10953620	game remember the thief series that's one of the big games they're working on so that's
10953620	10959740	pretty cool and of course I'm sure their secret products and all that good stuff so all right
10959740	10967780	well that brings us to phone calls so if you want to give us a call you can one eight seven

11017820	11021340	all gonna die because I'm the healer but I just got up off my computer and went to the
11021340	11028380	other room we're more you know what they say real life greater than Wow what well no not
11028380	11034340	always but in this case sure why not all right well what was worth ditching the group to
11034340	11040620	talk to us about tonight well first off I'm still really mad about electronica not going
11040620	11045300	to be you know up and running when I go to Anaheim in a couple weeks I told well what
11045300	11050420	about Oscar what about what about Oscar who emailed us saying that he went to Disney World
11050420	11054580	expecting to see a version of it there and he got the shaft he got Tron on blu-ray that's
11054580	11062020	what he got well you know that's a good movie so I mean get something out of it I'm gonna
11062020	11067700	go there and I'm not gonna get anything because there won't be a store there won't be no I
11067700	11072220	said go to D Street the D Street store has like the Tron jackets are all the hats and
11072220	11076860	jackets haven't you seen my Tron jacket like didn't you see that you were like oh you haven't
11076860	11083620	seen the hat oh you saw the four different jacket my jacket is awesome did you see that
11083620	11088740	picture of me on Facebook with the disc and everything forget it no you need to go find
11088740	11094500	it but I need the jacket apparently like now there's some awesome yeah there's a windbreaker
11094500	11098840	there's a jacket there's a parka there's a but they're really expensive well get a Tron
11098840	11104540	parka that's awesome well okay since you were I'm gonna find that picture on Facebook in
11104540	11109500	my jacket and while you talk about whatever else you want to talk about tonight oh um
11109500	11116100	the other thing is I like origin over steam I've decided so even though a lot of people
11116100	11121780	have been slamming origin you are a fan of it why is this I just think it looks cleaner
11121780	11127740	um it's easier to navigate in my opinion I've been playing Mass Effect 2 on it it's prettier
11127740	11138380	was that I'm it's prettier yes and that's all that matters usually for me so because
11138380	11144580	it's prettier and I can navigate it and I don't know I just like it better I wish more
11144580	11154060	things were on it like VVVVVVV or a portal loaded through it I'd be cool but no no it's
11154060	11159740	not there but I still like it better I sent you a link by the way are you at your computer
11159740	11165420	or did you leave no I left oh because I said I sent you my computer I sent you a link to
11165420	11170420	that picture of the jacket I don't want to go by my computer I don't want to see me get
11170420	11177580	group kids I've never been group kids so do you think okay then do you think people are
11177580	11182460	just being unnecessarily rude to origin because of all these stories about how you know they're
11182460	11188300	kind of trying to bully their way in with exclusives and making people use it for battlefield
11188300	11193620	3 which is gonna be a huge game and all that or is it just like you don't care it's really
11193620	11199200	more that you know steam's been around so long everybody loves steam and here's something
11199200	11203380	new and nobody wants to try it because it's not steam and so now that they're trying to
11203380	11208380	pull well we want to put our own games only on our service that's offensive to these people
11208380	11215700	that like steam only I mean it's not like GameStop's freaking platform that sucks because
11215700	11221100	it's GameStop and they're terrible it's just EA and they used to be terrible but Activision
11221100	11227680	has that title now so we can be okay with EA people need to realize that Microsoft came
11227680	11232900	out with their game purchase client game for windows yeah games games for windows which
11232900	11238540	was a steam clone and they had exclusives I think it was the only way to buy fable 3
11238540	11242160	or fable 2 at the very beginning and no one cared because it was just an ugly application
11242160	11246940	that didn't have a library and it had game room making sure that no one cared because
11246940	11251980	it was just a fable game so it was overhyped and not worth the money well yeah that and
11251980	11256980	even the third-party games that they got licensed to sell on their store the library wasn't
11256980	11262660	there so like oh you could buy fable 3 or Arkham Asylum which is a great game but between
11262660	11268860	the two I'm not gonna start giving them my money through their you know game platform
11268860	11274460	so you think people actually have good games you think you think people need to cut origin
11274460	11282060	a break and just check it out already yeah I mean you don't have to get all upset because
11282060	11286900	you were going to buy battlefield on steam no well you're not gonna use your steam client
11286900	11292500	it's a big deal you'll still get it anyway and origins not that bad like I'll install
11292500	11297380	it and check it out white and orange I just don't I don't like having like five different
11297380	11300460	stores on my computer I already have the games for windows thing which granted I don't even
11300460	11304580	use it well you can delete that I know I can delete that but that's I I have game room
11304580	11308340	believe it or not I bought game room stuff for my PC so I kind of have to keep it to
11308340	11314540	play that but otherwise you know steam but if origin sells a crazy ass like two dollar
11314540	11318780	game sale if they have the state if they have the sales like steam does I will definitely
11318780	11325020	I might have to do it yeah I don't want to but I will all right well anything else you
11325020	11328940	want to talk about me you can have two things running it's fine I have steam and origin
11328940	11333700	running all the time together they're friends all right well is there anything else you
11333700	11339180	want to talk about tonight me to talk I'm working on Pokemon right now too so I'm like
11339180	11345660	trying to divide my time easily between this phone call Pokemon World of Warcraft hard
11345660	11355140	I have a Pokemon question for me Klotov if I were to buy one of these two things and
11355140	11361780	it was going because I've never played Pokemon so I'm okay oh my god yeah so leave right
11361780	11366220	now the studio and go to what time is it there's something's got to be open that can sell you
11366220	11375140	it between either black and white or heart gold and soul silver I have to pick one of
11375140	11379180	the one of the two generations and that's going to be my definitive Pokemon experience
11379180	11383580	which one do you think I should get black and white black and white black and white
11383580	11388980	I think it's amazing like soul silver and heart gold are pretty cool because you can
11388980	11393700	get like all the old starters and it's all nostalgic but if you haven't played them before
11393700	11400540	you're not gonna get nostalgic for that crap and black and white is just overall better
11400540	11405580	made like they actually have the sprites that move it's very annoying playing one of those
11405580	11410460	games it's like I do an attack well my guy is frozen but he slightly moves forward because
11410460	11415060	he tackled you and it's stupid but at least he's like kind of wobble around and they have
11415060	11422140	animations and I felt the story was kind of darker too which is which was neat and plus
11422140	11426140	everything that I like comes out download wise is going to be for the newest ones and
11426140	11433220	not for the old ones anymore so like you'd be stuck with no cool downloads no special
11433220	11439460	events just plain old silver and gold but remain to be more fun than they used to be
11439460	11444840	but not worth it black and white act deaf in our chat room agrees black or white what
11444840	11448900	act deaf in our chat room agrees get pokemon black or white because I just heard from pokemon
11448900	11453460	phantom that gen 2 which would be silver and gold is like the best but I guess that's a
11453460	11459580	lot of nostalgia talking so I'll yeah I'll pick up white oh which color are you gonna
11459580	11464820	get oh I'm not I don't know I still need to use that card for the evil store so I might
11464820	11472380	pick up one of those oh it's like like I want you to get pokemon but not in that way all
11472380	11476620	right I feel really disgusted me glaDOS you guys are gonna have to talk offline I gotta
11476620	11481980	get to other calls tonight fine whatever all right bye enjoy getting cake from your group
11481980	11487860	all right hopefully he'll see that picture too and he'll be very hateful let's get to
11487860	11490600	another call there's more calls coming in hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
11490600	11497940	hey guys it's ddr dollar bill ddr dollar bill what's on your mind not much first off great
11497940	11502700	show tonight thank you a little long but that's all right it's labor day that's cool it's much
11502700	11510580	for fun that way all right I'll just make a sort of brief but uh they had a sale this
11510580	11516700	week at Best Buy where they were so enchanted even for $10 oh yeah I heard about that huh
11516700	11523620	yeah I I was like me and about three other co-workers were busy going to Best Buy website
11523620	11527620	and trying our best to get our hands it again because they were they were just being sold
11527620	11536820	out or back ordered everywhere it's just insane um but I did pick up a copy eventually and
11536820	11544580	I want to say I was impressed but at the same time I wasn't well let's let's break it down
11544580	11549020	let's start with the bad why why why did you leave with a feeling of me why weren't you
11549020	11555100	impressed because I was trying with the kinetic controllers and waving my hands and it didn't
11555100	11563300	feel responsive it really didn't feel responsive right like I couldn't I the controls confused
11563300	11567700	me a bit because I couldn't tell even from a tutorial which was to lock on what was the
11567700	11572780	auto fire what was this it was just bizarre please tell me you tried the controller at
11572780	11580140	some point though uh not yet but only because I figured it's part since eventually I got
11580140	11584580	the hang of it and since I was used to playing rez a lot I'm like okay now I got the hang
11584580	11590060	of let's just play like rez yeah try try try the controller it's just like rez at some
11590060	11595940	point try the controller you'll you'll be like okay this isn't so bad and plus it is
11595940	11600500	instead of because there's different uh scoreboards for connect versus controller and so forth
11600500	11608100	so you do get something out of it true I mean the opening visuals although a little long
11608100	11612780	were very good I mean I loved it and I did love some of the uh backgrounds and graphics
11612780	11619100	used and the music was okay it's just I didn't really pay attention to it because it's just
11619100	11622780	it didn't seem to blend in so I couldn't hear the music I was just too busy focusing on
11622780	11628140	the screen uh I think the problem is that so many people were talking so much hype about
11628140	11633960	it I felt like I felt like I was gonna get this game and I was gonna go outside and start
11633960	11637740	touching people and healing them because I always get the way the god power or something
11637740	11643660	like maybe maybe the artsiness of the game was was hyped up too much yeah which is probably
11643660	11649460	explains why I didn't like braid so much like I still love braid it's a great game I mean
11649460	11654520	yeah some people like the people like to smell their own farts like are really into oh braid
11654520	11658800	is an experience but yeah I just think braid is a solid game like it's a for like a download
11658800	11664780	title it's just it's fun it wasn't bad it was just it was like the gameplay itself was
11664780	11673260	nice the hype killed it the hype killed it the hype killed it yes and the ambiguous storyline
11673260	11683560	sort of left me feeling let me feel a sense of blue balls like what the hell just happened
11683560	11688160	all right well let's let's try to wrap on a positive note what did you enjoy on child
11688160	11691680	of eden what you said you were left with mixed feelings so there was some good what was the
11691680	11696920	good that you liked um the fact that like I said after I got used to connect controls
11696920	11702660	and use the gameplay I figured okay it's kind of like rez but a little easier because rez
11702660	11708080	at a few points got to be really insanely hard to the point of where you had a time
11708080	11714140	everything precisely otherwise it just didn't work so but child of eden just played a lot
11714140	11718900	easier and flowed a little better so you know I was okay with it I thought it was a good
11718900	11722500	game I just didn't think was god's gift game but I thought it was a really good game though
11722500	11727320	well I think the best news of all is you only paid ten dollars for it most people paid fifty
11727320	11735040	so yeah and the craziest part was the pre-owned was 35 uh that's a little backwards I know
11735040	11741300	I wonder how many people bought those just to sell them back to another store make some
11741300	11750520	money all right uh ddr dollar bill any other thoughts tonight um I had them and they went
11750520	11753760	out the window unfortunately you gotta write them down all right send us an email then
11753760	11757640	when you think of them all right take it easy guys all right have a good one buddy take
11757640	11763680	care bye uh 877 game olr or username on skype is orange launch radio let me get to some
11763680	11766640	of these tweets here I've been neglecting the twitter because the phone's actually been
11766640	11773300	uh uh lighting up here uh steve merryfield uh tweets us saying olr just got tickets to
11773300	11778100	video games live here in salt lake city have any of you been to see it it will be my first
11778100	11782080	uh yes I've been to see it it was the first time I ever met salacious pop for like five
11782080	11786920	seconds was at video games live actually um right remember yeah in person I mean I knew
11786920	11790760	you online but it was the first time I met you in person because I I found spike and
11790760	11795920	you were with spike I think and no I was with uh frat mad actually yeah and uh I was like
11795920	11799360	but I knew I knew I've known him for a long time we've been following each other on live
11799360	11804480	journal for years and then right when we shook hands the lights went down yes to go sit but
11804480	11809160	the show itself was a lot of fun um I think it's a very fun high energy show whereas like
11809160	11815280	uh the final fantasy dear friends was very much a night out at the opera uh tommy talarico
11815280	11820260	puts on a fun show and he's definitely about fun and bringing music you know and fusing
11820260	11825020	fun we did an interview with him and I don't remember what episode number it is I'm sure
11825020	11829200	it's on the olr wiki somewhere and it was a few years ago so it's back there I was in
11829200	11834720	the episode 200 somewhere probably uh but it was great and uh you check that it was
11834720	11839580	a long interview uh maybe somebody in chat will shout it out if some of the olr historians
11839580	11849640	who know their wiki really well uh will find that so um yeah so uh I thought I had a really
11849640	11853400	good time at video games live and so I think it's worth seeing at least once in your life
11853400	11859080	uh do you agree alan did you like video games live yeah no yeah good stuff all right let's
11859080	11862080	go to the phones you're getting another call hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this
11862080	11869880	yo it's zino core from the okc how y'all doing hello okc zino core what is up buddy not much
11869880	11873940	not much I hope everybody's been paying attention to what the hell good old gains has been doing
11873940	11877760	lately because I've been playing the hell out of my copy of wind commander one and two
11877760	11881840	I have not had the chance to bring this up I was thinking of it during the break and
11881840	11886160	I forgot thank you for reminding me I did play good old games this week I finally made
11886160	11888960	an account on there but do you know it wasn't the wing commander thing that put me over
11888960	11892960	the edge although I think that's awesome it was the fact that they were giving away Ultima
11892960	11897920	4 quest of the avatar for free oh yeah that's right I did hear about that one too god I
11897920	11901920	miss the Ultima series it was a great series I mean yes I realize there's still Ultima
11901920	11906960	online and all that stuff but man the Ultima series is a great series and you know you
11906960	11910640	know they were gonna make a tenth one a few years ago and they just it was a canceled
11910640	11914960	project yeah it was a 3d a full 3d engine and everything and I think it just got too
11914960	11920840	big for what they were planning on yeah it's unfortunate but yes I made a GOG account this
11920840	11927320	week to get my copy of Ultima 4 even though I could probably download a copy on an abandonware
11927320	11931760	site somewhere but what I love about good old games or at least so far that I've experienced
11931760	11937440	is that they have the little DOS box thing fine-tuned to work like I don't have to think
11937440	11942760	about all these settings on how to emulate it just works and I like that I like that
11942760	11947440	it just works yeah it's worth the six bucks especially with the Wing Commander packs that
11947440	11952180	you're getting both Wing Commander one and two and the secret missions I think for one
11952180	11958320	both one and two and on top of that they actually have the I what I think is the game development
11958320	11963000	Bible for Wing Commander one and two because it covers every character every facet of the
11963000	11968600	game through Wing Commander one secret operations Wing Commander two and three so it's like
11968600	11974020	good lord it's the 50 megabyte PDF file what the hell's in this thing and it literally
11974020	11977620	it's like the the resource document for a game design so it's like that that's kind
11977620	11982600	of cool you know it on top of my purchase of Crusader Nora Morrison it's like I got
11982600	11986160	to give props to these guys are finally getting the games I want to buy from them so yeah
11986160	11991160	yeah so yeah good old games is you know if you if you are like why don't they make games
11991160	11993880	like they used to or you just want to play something from your youth that doesn't seem
11993880	11997200	to work on the computer check out good old games I will say this their library isn't
11997200	12002320	vast right now like one of the first games I went to go look up on good old games because
12002320	12006760	I like I would have paid 10 bucks for this game if I could find it it's a Sid Meier game
12006760	12012000	that's not civilization it's not even colonization and this is actually one of the games he said
12012000	12016540	he he in retrospect says it wasn't very good because they try to be too ambitious with
12016540	12022680	it but I disagree and it's covert action Sid Meier's covert action is like this James Bond-ish
12022680	12028120	type of game and its problem was that it was basically four separate games all thrown together
12028120	12034420	but I love covert action and I was hoping it was on good old games but it's not I was
12034420	12039720	hoping they pick up that one game spy craft that they ran back in like the early 90s that
12039720	12043840	was all full motion video and stuff and all James Bond-esque even had live torture in
12043840	12048640	there it's kind of weird it's done in our chat by the way is verifying it still free
12048640	12053200	right now is at the time we're recording and put a link in chat at GOG.com for Ultima 4
12053200	12060840	if you want to check it out yeah so everybody go get it now go on do it now anyway that's
12060840	12064320	all I had make sure you love your old games guys as I show your old games some love I
12064320	12068000	think that was a great tip thank you for bringing it up because I want to mention GOG but I
12068000	12072040	got sidetracked with all the Disney talk well here I am putting you back on check all right
12072040	12078760	thank you very much I appreciate it looking out for us take care all right bye all right
12078760	12085560	interesting we've had a lot of calls that are tonight kind of endorsing online services
12085560	12091360	it's kind of neat so wow some people in chat remember covert action I feel loved DDR dollar
12091360	12095360	bill says fuck yeah and Kai's you know says covert action is the best I love that game
12095360	12102760	oh my god act-deaf to by the way also went in the wiki and found it was episode 285 from
12102760	12109800	June 29th 2008 had the Tommy Tallarico interview that would have been right around our seventh
12109800	12116720	anniversary show it was probably the weekend before so there you go 285 as to where you
12116720	12124360	can find episode 285 come into chat that or associate calm at some point and hell I might
12124360	12128960	have it still somewhere but I'm sure is it some folks like dark to see and so forth have
12128960	12135600	the old episodes and it might even be on the ol archive dot TK our FTP server thanks to
12135600	12141240	the generosity of the web people to put it on including VX Jason XV is just the man that
12141240	12147400	helps our website have a place to be up to our FTP some time ago so we haven't actually
12147400	12152680	deleted anything from the FTP in like one or two years so you might it might still be
12152680	12157900	on the FTP I'm just not sure so one thing that I thought was funny about that video
12157900	12164120	games live performance we went to is that I feel that Bay Area geeks are kind of pretentious
12164120	12171600	and how serious you know they take everything and that video games live was where they debuted
12171600	12178440	their orchestra performance of the time scar Oh scar of time scar time from Chrono Cross
12178440	12183840	and they they it was like a medley with a big song from Chrono Trigger and it was like
12183840	12189560	the world premiere and everyone of course loved it but we were all so serious in the
12189560	12194120	audience that like no no one made a peep because it was such an awesome moment for those those
12194120	12199200	beautiful songs to be played but I think Tommy Tallarico was like like he didn't like it's
12199200	12203040	like they're all just dead in the audience but we were just all in there and I was just
12203040	12207120	really into it like they are it very people don't fuck around yeah and he kept for us
12207120	12211180	to play this next song everyone stand up say yeah and like pump your fists and we're like
12211180	12216160	we don't do that here bro we're very serious we don't hoot and holler in San Francisco
12216160	12221320	we're serious business I think that kind of went against his personality but I mean but
12221320	12227860	also I I Tommy does great things I'm not slamming what he does but I think to do that like like
12227860	12233920	fist pump for Chrono Cross not really like you fist pump for Halo you fist pump for you
12233920	12237480	know those those other types of high energy games I'm not saying that Chrono Cross is
12237480	12240400	a boring game or whatever but it's just you know role-playing games are a little different
12240400	12246720	it's art damn it yes yes thank you it's art damn it all right there's hella people in
12246720	12251320	our chat room that are like fuck yeah free Ultima 4 I will say this I had Ultima 4 on
12251320	12258280	the NES it was so good like it's just it's hard as fuck but it is good it's a good game
12258280	12263480	all right anyhow back to tweets we keep being derailed from tweets tonight let's see going
12263480	12270160	to redertainment which game coming out holiday do you think will be the biggest bust I think
12270160	12275680	Skyrim will disappoint but uncharted 3 will sell poorly oh that's an interesting question
12275680	12280320	entertainment says which game do you think will be the biggest bust this holiday I actually
12280320	12285480	disagree I think Skyrim is gonna do awesome but that's total fanboy in me what do you
12285480	12291040	think Loki you're grinning over there what what game do you think will be a bust Skylanders
12291040	12297400	I fucking hate Skylanders I hope it burns oh is that the the game with the pets and
12297400	12304480	stuff it's a game from Activision starring Spyro Skylanders yes you ran it about this
12304480	12312460	before fuck that burns and fire um I'm see I would have said Star Wars connect but they
12312460	12318240	already bumped it to 2012 so now I'm in a predicament what do I say is going to disappoint
12318240	12321760	this holiday I don't know I feel like everything that might have disappointed got bumped to
12321760	12325280	Christmas I don't think I can say the 3ds because it's no longer got the Vita to compete
12325280	12330880	with well I could say one but it's probably just a no-brainer Silent Hill but yeah but
12330880	12336400	I don't even consider that like a big title with high expectations I I don't know I don't
12336400	12346040	know what would possibly disappoint so then I reloaded somebody's gonna really hate me
12346040	12351600	for saying this I think the game will be great but Dance Central too I think that I don't
12351600	12357360	think it's gonna be quite as huge of a deal as the first one and it's because the market
12357360	12362200	has been saturated because now you have the Just Dance and so far I hope it doesn't but
12362200	12365560	I don't know there's this weird part of me that's kind of like I don't think it's gonna
12365560	12369800	make waves like the first one did I hope I'm wrong I hope I'm wrong because I really like
12369800	12374120	those games but I just think the markets gonna be very saturated and I'm a little worried
12374120	12379880	Knights of the Old Republic MMO you are just going for the throat and all of those wow
12379880	12385000	players that are really don't like wow and want Knights of the Old Republic to just finally
12385000	12389040	take me away from wow please Jesus God six years have been playing this shed be the promised
12389040	12393940	land and they're gonna play and it's gonna be like oh no this isn't the solution I was
12393940	12402440	looking for that's that's a clever response I like that all right anyhow moving on to
12402440	12408880	other tweets spazinator sends us a very interesting tweets well it finally happened I have become
12408880	12414200	an ex-bot fuck Sony I'll pirate their shit before I buy any of their stuff again sorry
12414200	12419320	I won't be in chat personal stuff going on now if you've been listening to orange on
12419320	12422600	radio for the past I don't know a couple of years spazinator calls in pretty reliably
12422600	12426720	once a month if not a little more often that and talks about the latest going on on PSN
12426720	12430000	especially the video marketplace but he's also run into some major issues when it comes
12430000	12434640	to he's had like three of them break down on him so I'm very curious to see what sent
12434640	12439140	him over the edge like was it one more breakdown was it one bad customer service call like
12439140	12443540	I've got to know like what fucking just because that and I wouldn't I would not see those
12443540	12448200	tweets coming from spazinator like what fucking broke him like I've got to know I've got to
12448200	12453160	know right yeah and he had problems where he would buy games and then he would get a
12453160	12457600	new console but they wouldn't unlock his games for him yeah yeah he had a lot of problems
12457600	12463240	with them I don't know so pod culture sent us a tweet that says hello from dragon con
12463240	12466800	so we want to say hello right back to pod culture sorry you and bobby couldn't get
12466800	12471240	on the show tonight we had a late start live we miss you guys and congrats on your parsec
12471240	12478240	award that you won for your podcast the tardis interruptus the name escaped me for a minute
12478240	12483440	there but thank you the doctor who podcast moving on to some tweets from tiger claw a
12483440	12487080	couple tweets here I read this right before the show this is fascinating to me League
12487080	12493140	of Legends shutting down mac support tweets tiger claw a story that after a year of beta
12493140	12497160	testing riot games is just canceling mac off support for League of Legends it will be ending
12497160	12502200	at midnight on Tuesday they've said quote our current approach regarding the mac platform
12502200	12507840	won't guarantee the quality and frequent updates we deliver today on the pc they're not ruling
12507840	12511680	out a mac version in the future they say they are committed to building a solution that
12511680	12515300	will work on the mac in the long run but it will take some time the shutdown will be effective
12515300	12520960	midnight on September 6 now the beta testers who used League of Legends they can either
12520960	12525000	get a full refund if they use the store or they can keep their accounts open and play
12525000	12530320	on a pc all the mac players will get a code for a champion pack a mac player means that
12530320	12534360	the majority of the logins came from the mac client those have to also be redeemed before
12534360	12538160	Tuesday so if you're a mac player League of Legends go get your free ship before they
12538160	12546280	shut it down right pretty much is what it is that's a bummer uh let's see also another
12546280	12551580	tweet here uh he sent us a tweet about that whole comcast story it's not directly related
12551580	12557840	to games but did you hear about how comcast uh in a nutshell hurricane irene happened
12557840	12562120	and shut down the power and comcast won't refund people for it because they say that's
12562120	12571320	an act of god but if you don't believe in god tricky tricky uh no you're right it could
12571320	12576160	be i don't know but i'm sorry i don't believe in god so they consider a hurricane part of
12576160	12580600	that but here's the thing i also kind of why don't you just call it act of nature you can't
12580600	12585440	dispute it is nature whatever i'm not going to get into that because it's way too controversial
12585440	12590560	for our little video game show however i will say this i i it's not that i'm siding with
12590560	12594480	comcast in this i kind of just think you should do the goodwill thing and you know it was
12594480	12597680	a pretty big event you should just chip in the extra extra couple days internet and suck
12597680	12604680	it up but i mean you guys you guys power outages are gonna happen and like you will be without
12604680	12610680	cable tv and you know i understand that's gonna happen but they're you know the power
12610680	12616720	company doesn't charge me for power that i'm using when there's no power and you know what
12616720	12620800	comcast could easily fucking bury their goddamn lines in the ground we wouldn't have any of
12620800	12627520	this problem i i i do think they should just suck it up and do it out of goodwill but i
12627520	12631920	also at the same time i'm just saying you know what they're these are risks you take
12631920	12637320	and i kind of think it's justified a little bit i think it's bad at customer relations
12637320	12645600	but it's it's it's not a illegal business decision i just think it's not gonna keep
12645600	12650440	people in their good graces that's all
12650440	12655120	when i worked at pac bell and we had a two or three day outage of dsl broadband in a
12655120	12660840	certain area or just just like our email service went down for a couple days we would say okay
12660840	12665440	you're paying 20 bucks a month it was down for three days i have supervisor approval
12665440	12671480	to refund you for seven cents and of course the customer would go completely batshit but
12671480	12675960	it's like this this is in our it's in our terms of terms and conditions that we have
12675960	12682120	outages right and you're agreeing to deal with that right all right sorry it's probably
12682120	12686080	not the popular response you were hoping from us angry people at olr but you know we you
12686080	12690460	have to kind of look at both sides of it i'm just happy that the hurricane didn't end up
12690460	12695280	being as horrific as they thought i mean yes i understand vermont flooded and some people
12695280	12702120	were in bad situations and that really sucks however i'm glad it wasn't as terrible as
12702120	12705800	they were saying in the beginning right like we were thinking it was going to be even worse
12705800	12712720	so i'm just really glad it wasn't even worse anyhow uh one more tweet from tiger claw and
12712720	12715600	this is interesting because it's about i didn't hear about this for the show tonight but i
12715600	12723080	guess there is an uncharted 3 trailer that is uh out and it is a portuguese trailer and
12723080	12731280	they did a version of it that i guess i guess the way they translated the trailer or whatever
12731280	12737040	and the way the voices sound and so forth isn't going over very well in brazil and they're
12737040	12741120	going to naughty dogs forums to just basically yell at people and say that you know you don't
12741120	12744400	even know what the hell you're doing basically it's kind of like you know when you get a
12744400	12750480	really bad english dub here like come on who didn't see one of those videos for heavy rain
12750480	12755520	jason jason like you know and it was very obviously french people doing english accents
12755520	12758720	you know it's kind of like that similar thing but we take a lot of that for granted because
12758720	12764320	you know if it's english the most you know between that and japanese like the two languages
12764320	12770460	used in most games we just take for granted that uh the other languages probably sound
12770460	12778920	all right too and this is a case where it doesn't so there you go all right and a couple
12778920	12785840	more tweets here uh dart ditsuya tweeted us and said here's confirmation the anaheim move
12785840	12789840	for wondercon was confirmed there will not be wondercon in san francisco next year it's
12789840	12796720	in anahine moscone center is being completely like that wing of it is being shut down for
12796720	12802480	renovations so the weekend that they would want to have it no choice it's yeah no choice
12802480	12808080	all right and lastly tonight shad leland tweets us saying forgot to mention on the phone dance
12808080	12812080	central two crews are awesome and it sounds like they have big plans for them reminds
12812080	12817240	me of bust a groove bust a move now those were good fucking games i just saw a little
12817240	12821880	gameplay clip of one of those games the other night and i was like god i know that game
