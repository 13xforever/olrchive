14108	18836	Tonight, September 4th, 2011, a former QA tester sues one developer.
19196	21880	Details on Dragon Quest X are soon to be revealed.
22241	24965	And will there soon be a museum dedicated to video games?
32025	37909	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of that show where every gamer has a voice.
38129	39830	Orange Lounge Radio.
40290	41311	We are live.
41371	42952	It is Sunday, September the 4th of 2011.
43612	46294	It's Labor Day weekend and we're live at All Games Radio.
46834	53859	www.allgames.com where we are live every week at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
53899	54579	Although not tonight.
54639	55279	He had the night off.
55299	59142	He's at Dragon Con and I know he's going to have a full report on all of that next week.
59582	60102	DarkSakura.com
85072	85393	TechMasterLoki
109765	111727	And Loki, oh my gosh, we're having so much fun tonight.
111747	112908	You're not plugged in tonight, Loki.
113988	116811	We're having a little bit of fail tonight, and I'll get to that in a minute.
116851	118432	I'm sure everybody's like, tonight?
118932	120233	Isn't that every night you have a little fail?
120273	120934	Okay, try again, Loki.
120974	121314	Alright.
121354	122095	Techmaster Loki!
122275	123156	And everybody had it wrong.
123236	125718	It wasn't anything, it wasn't double bacon strips.
125798	129340	It was a double western bacon cheeseburger from Carl's Jr.
129601	131282	Or Hardee's, I guess, on the east coast.
131676	133117	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
152975	158277	Podcast listeners, you got the better end of the deal because we are 25 minutes late in starting tonight.
158377	159098	We're struggling.
159198	160698	It's a very struggling evening.
160878	163560	Yes, and we've just had tech fail.
163620	166541	We've had can't get into the studio when Jamie's not here fail.
166881	170382	We've just had all sorts of problems, so I apologize.
170462	173884	But we'll find our rhythm eventually and put on a show.
176385	178486	And Dan is yelling at us in the living room to quit complaining.
179321	181683	So anyway, let's go back to Salacious Pop.
182204	184385	And you're here, but you haven't been here a little while.
184405	185406	When was the last time you were on the show?
186247	188449	I want to say it was either April or before.
189390	201140	I think it's kind of funny that now that I actually live up in Sacramento where Studio OLR is, roughly, I'm on the show far less than I was before, even though I'm living with one of the co-hosts.
201440	207084	So for those that are new to Orange Lawn Tradio and maybe haven't heard you on the show before, tell us a little bit about yourself.
207324	208865	What kind of games are you into?
208885	209305	What do you like?
210186	212608	I've been gaming since I was four or five.
212968	214589	My first system was an Atari 2600.
217491	221153	Most of my gaming was probably done during the SNES and PS1 generations.
221513	226056	I own all the systems and have a ton of games, but I don't really console game much anymore.
226797	228118	I'm mostly a PC gamer.
228638	230640	I'm more into gaming culture.
231760	253833	um those are my people but as far as actually sitting down when we'll get to this when we get to my um gaming week don't really play as much as I used to what do you mean by like gaming culture and those are my people when you say that just the various fandoms and you know following the sort of you know I still follow the news for games that I know I'm not going to play but I still find it interesting and
255533	258274	But there are some games you still do play today, right?
258494	263016	Of course You still have all the systems, 360, PS3, right?
263176	282804	Yep, the only one I didn't get this generation was the Wii So, not missing much Top three games ever Not to put you on the spot or anything If you can't think of your top three, just like three really freaking great games Super Metroid Good pick Valkyrie Profile That's a good pick too
283995	285537	and Street Fighter Alpha 2.
286257	287798	Why Alpha 2 and not just straight up 2?
288679	290240	Which is the most notable, I suppose.
290260	302931	I think the Alpha or Zero series is the best Street Fighter has ever been as far as art design, play style, combo system, music, everything.
303391	305032	Dan came in here and gave the big thumbs up.
305072	306193	I think all is forgiven now.
306213	306774	Yeah.
308601	308861	DarkSakura
329268	329448	What?
329768	332070	That's what it sounds like, because in place of DarkSakura.
332611	333892	Oh, shut up.
334253	334593	All right.
335814	338417	Anyhow, you guys are crazy.
338757	340619	All right, we're going to get into how was your gaming week.
340659	342200	But first, we weren't here last week.
342240	348326	So not only have we had a little bit of fail and starting a little late tonight, but we were not here at all last week.
349307	350809	Salacious Pop and I were at Disneyland.
351269	373640	Which was awesome, I don't have to tell you twice A lot of lulzy, funny stuff about the Electronica event that happens at Disneyland Because if you guys don't know what Electronica is, it happens at Disneyland California Adventure, the second park down there, Westcott if you will It is an event that happens at night Which is becoming more like the first park to be honest
374079	374500	E3 Electronica
392338	392998	Thanks for watching!
413171	418095	and all these cool little Tron decorations and people dressed up in Tron gear.
418115	423740	And they're basically having like a giant rave and playing like Daft Punk and that sort of music.
423760	424100	I don't know.
424500	426942	Am I saying everything correctly here, Salacious Pop, about Electronica?
427122	427963	Yeah, sounds about right.
428403	428564	So...
429244	431845	We love Electronica because we're nerds and we love Tron.
432025	434466	Tron is one of the greatest Disney products there is, right?
434786	437867	Electronica was not supposed to be at the park anymore.
437887	440488	It was supposed to finish not long after the movie came out.
440508	442568	And it's been extended time and time and time again.
442988	446810	And the most recent news on the net was it's being extended through Spring 2012.
447910	448370	Thanks for watching!
463477	469321	I was talking to an employee kind of candidly about Electronica and he said, well, yeah, you know, it's closing after Labor Day.
469741	470721	And we're like, what?
471402	472362	It's closing after Labor Day?
472402	479467	But we heard it was spring 2012 and we have like all these people that we know that are coming to the park in October like just to go to Electronica and check it out before it closes.
480087	486491	And he was like, well, yeah, it's closing after Labor Day and it's, you know, it's probably going to come back in a different configuration.
487051	488192	and we were like, oh my gosh.
488332	494254	So, making posts to Facebook, angry friends making comments about how could Electronica close before they see it.
494394	498276	It was like telling a bunch of preschoolers that Santa Claus had died.
498656	499617	Yeah, basically.
499637	500997	They were like, what, no!
501157	503979	It was, yeah, or just like slapping ice cream out of their hand.
504999	505680	Same reaction.
505820	507961	What is that thing, coning, or whatever?
508061	511042	It's like that, where you grab the top of the cone, that dumbass thing.
511062	512102	So it was stupid.
512443	513083	Yes, it was!
513723	514584	So, anyhow...
515504	524093	To make a long story short, too late I know, we found out that yes, Electronica is closing after Labor Day, but for three weeks.
524594	527337	Then it's coming back, weekends only, through spring.
527357	534024	You have to understand, they're putting Electronica in the Disney vault, and then they're going to re-release it later on as special editions.
534504	561099	because that's what Disney does with everything so finally we figured that out so my friends that are going to the park in October are happy because they'll get to see it because they're going on a weekend so it doesn't matter that it's weekends only, it's fine Miklatov was going to be going the week before it reopens and now he's pissed so I'm not supposed to probably be talking about that on the show but oh well, what are you going to do and look at that, he just joined chat to stomp and pout with our chatters at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
562054	574081	so uh yeah so we had fun at Disneyland and Electronica and all that and um so that's where we were last week and we just ended up having the show off because Jamie was helping a friend move and you know Loki's got the kids so he enjoys a week off
574551	575852	Thanks for watching!
597413	600074	It's just like the arcade in the movie and all the machines actually work.
600114	603114	And how often do you get to go to an arcade where the machines freaking work?
603494	605875	Since Starcade is ruined, they should make it permanent.
605895	608415	Dan is saying since Starcade is ruined, they should just make it permanent.
608435	608775	They should.
609076	610456	They should move Flynn's into Starcade.
610776	612836	But here's the rumors about the replacement.
612856	615057	I don't mean to turn this into a Disney podcast, but deal.
616377	619778	They're going to replace Electronica with the Mad Tea Party.
620278	621598	Based off of the Tim Burton.
625299	628041	But if you think about it, it's going to be so easy to convert.
628341	636405	All they have to do, get Zeus, a Mad Hatter outfit, get all the dancers, little, you know, wacky colors and stuff.
636525	639187	And then close Flynn's Arcade or turn it into a tea room or something.
639307	640527	I hope that doesn't happen.
640828	644490	I think Flynn's Arcade should stay a fixture, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
645610	649432	Well, they need to move Flynn's Arcade to the part that's next to Space Mountain.
649792	652533	Because they used to have Tron stuff in Tomorrowland.
652553	658255	Well, see, here's the thing, though, is that since Star Tours is all new, they want all that business in the area or what have you.
658315	658815	So, I don't know.
658935	659435	It would be nice.
660036	660196	But...
661196	665878	Sadly, there's just not a lot of arcade love in the world anymore.
666138	667878	And I think that even at Disneyland you're seeing it.
667898	672540	Get rid of that stupid Imagineering spinning piece of crap that was there.
672560	679242	How fucking badass would it be if they would take that dome and turn it into some type of light disc battle?
679582	681883	Like a battle arena, like a Tron battle arena.
682183	685524	Where there could be a ride where you go around in a little light bike or something.
685545	687065	It could just be all neon inside.
687325	689706	I mean, it would cost hella money to renovate that place, but it would be
689986	691607	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
712845	713586	So it's very old.
713606	716027	I remember that, but remember the rocket rods went really fast.
716067	721251	So have some sort of motorcycle ride thing.
721271	721591	Sweet.
721731	725754	And you can find Marvel merchandise at Disneyland now because of that.
725974	726754	Not really a merger.
726774	727855	They bought Marvel outright.
728055	728255	Right.
728696	736041	But in a lot of the Disney merch stores, you can find Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, action figures, the 316 Wii games, all that stuff.
736121	738622	I wonder when we're going to see some of those themed rides.
738742	742605	Because you know how all the Six Flags stuff have the DC rides?
742765	743125	Yeah, that's right.
743145	743846	They have the Superman.
744306	746628	Superman, Batman, and all that.
747569	749911	Again, I don't mean to turn this into a Disney podcast, but whatever.
750532	751573	It's an off night tonight anyway.
752654	753094	Here's the thing.
753154	760280	I think if Disney ever does do a third gate in Anaheim, which they have the space for, but it would mean California Ventures has got to be successful.
760400	764224	I think if they do a third park, they might do a third park about Marvel stuff.
764284	767547	And it could even be a thrill ride park to compete with Magic Mountain, but I don't know.
767927	768648	I'm not going to hold my breath.
769408	774593	and the Disney doesn't really have thrill parks because they're not very family friendly but I don't know I think one could be successful there
774875	778458	I think that's what California Adventure started off as.
778518	781561	Okay, we're going to try everything that didn't really fit in Disneyland.
781621	785004	And now it's like, we need more Disneyland in here.
786925	788086	Going to our chat room for some comments.
788287	790609	At least the chatters are into this tonight.
791129	794532	TigerClaw says, they will bring Electronica back when Tron 3 comes out.
794592	795833	You know, that's a distinct possibility.
796233	798595	I hope to God it's true they're making a Tron 3.
799356	801398	I heard the Bruce Boxleitner interview that 2013...
802939	807901	and they certainly have loaded and set it up for one in the Blu-ray so I really hope that does happen.
809582	812083	DarkTetsuya says Rob should work for Disney Imagineering.
812563	816604	Actdeft says if any Disney employee is listening they should hire Rob as an Imagineer.
816644	817405	Oh, I would love that.
817745	820226	In fact, I would just turn everything into Tron in Tomorrowland.
820851	821532	Hey, I'm down.
822113	822714	Autotopia?
822854	823475	Make a Tron!
823495	825257	I can Imagineer like... Space Mountain?
825297	825818	Tron!
825958	827340	I can Imagineer like anything.
827420	830204	I mean, just... Whatever you need, I'll Imagineer it.
830465	830825	Build it?
830985	836453	No, I'm not really good at doing that part, but hell, I can imagine all sorts of crazy things.
836513	837033	Disney Podcasts.
866773	878401	fuck the kids, Disneyland's for me that would probably be the name of it but I don't know how well that would do and how much Disney would approve of something like that so, didn't happen Disneyland's just something we really like
879150	880771	So anyhow, let's go back to games.
881172	882052	So we were off for a week.
882573	886936	So we don't have a lot of news in the show world tonight about what happened last week.
887036	894141	But I've got to talk about... I was going to say PAX happened, but I don't think that was really... PAX happened and surprisingly not a ton of news out of PAX.
894181	898644	I mean, in the indie scene and so forth, yes, and expansions, a few things like that.
899044	900906	But nothing major and I was...
901266	901947	Proven wrong.
902587	903928	Games analysts aren't always right.
904168	906070	I thought for sure Nintendo would announce those games.
906530	907971	Xenoblade and so forth coming out here.
908031	909653	They did not take the opportunity to at PAX.
910113	910713	I don't think it's happening.
910733	912275	They didn't do much of anything at PAX, did they?
912895	913055	No.
913155	915357	In fact, I didn't really hear even what they were showing at their booth.
915497	917198	I imagine it was all the 3DS stuff.
917258	918239	It's got to be what they were.
918359	921722	Well, they announced some new 3DS stuff, but we'll get into that later.
921922	922242	And then...
924870	931837	Yeah, it's pretty... And it's funny, they haven't really even announced the dates yet for the two Mario games on the 3DS.
931937	938684	It's just we know it's November, December, but they've already announced everything up through the end of November.
939385	940165	Where are those titles?
940646	943088	Oh, well, we'll come back to that.
943108	944610	We'll figure it out.
945251	946572	See how one of these other games do.
947481	953544	So the big news that happened last week was about a company I've been critical of on this show in the past.
953584	954864	It was GameStop.
955325	956645	I like Bobby's name for him.
956685	958026	I think I might jack the name.
958126	959707	Evil G is what he always calls him on the show.
960047	960687	I might call him that.
960747	971972	And I don't mean to disrespect the people working the front lines at the stores and so forth because I understand those of you that make very little money serving the customer directly are in a very thankless job.
972012	975674	And my beef with Evil G is not with those people.
976112	980094	Although some do get a bad rap, and I have been to some stores where those guys are a-holes.
980814	981555	But that's not my beef.
981895	988118	My beef with GameStop has to do with much higher management and some of the decisions they make and some of the ways that they run their company.
988178	991019	And funny enough, a lot of that came to light this last week.
991980	993360	I'm sure I don't need to report this.
993401	996782	I'm sure all of you have heard this or read it on a gaming blog somewhere.
996822	999524	But if you've been living in a cave, I'll kind of sum it up for you.
1000244	1002525	A new game was released last week, DarkSakura.
1002765	1003466	Deus Ex Streaming Service
1017822	1018703	Thank you for watching!
1036317	1040682	So they want to show off their service, try to get more people on OnLive, and get people buying games over there.
1041022	1047969	So they put in a coupon, some type of partnership with Square Enix, where you would be able to get a free version of Deus Ex on OnLive with a PC version.
1048250	1058620	Well, Evil G didn't like that, because Evil G just recently bought one of these online streaming companies, a competitor of OnLive, if you will, and clearly plans to launch their own service.
1059401	1070470	So, an internal memo was leaked to the internet where Evil G told their employees essentially to go open all of the boxes of Deus Ex on the PC, take out the code, and throw them away.
1071671	1072252	And that's that.
1072832	1078036	And so, obviously a lot of people not happy to know that the employees opened the product and took something out of it.
1078477	1079318	And then sold it as new.
1079638	1080579	And then sold it as new.
1080959	1082860	Which is funny to me because...
1083621	1099081	this isn't a new policy at the G this is not something new for them we've heard for years on the internet and so forth about how they open games let employees rent them and take them home and then bring them back to the store and sell them as a new game sometimes they reshrink them
1099301	1100062	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1115691	1116412	Let's be real.
1116592	1118813	I'm sure you can't cross-save.
1119133	1121374	The on-live servers don't talk to the PC yet.
1121674	1128877	So this on-live thing, and you're playing your normal version of the PC anyway, this on-live thing is really just a, oh, neat, I have it.
1128957	1131158	I play it for five minutes and then, neat, I saw it.
1131198	1131558	I'm done.
1132038	1136340	I bet very, very, very, very few people are truly using that coupon.
1136800	1142663	But because that coupon, you feel like it's a $50 value, now Evil G has ripped that out of your hands and you're pissed.
1143163	1144284	And now there's an issue.
1144904	1146845	with the policy that they've been doing for years.
1147205	1150946	And so this all came to light and it's been really, really bad for them.
1152627	1153707	Here's the surprising thing.
1154427	1157928	I'm slightly sympathetic towards GameStop.
1158548	1166051	I actually think it was kind of screwed up of Squeenix to include a competitor's coupon and not tell Evil G what they were doing.
1167130	1170652	The appropriate response is what GameStop did at the end of the day.
1171233	1175035	Finally, the next day, or maybe very late that day, they said, you know what?
1175055	1178958	We're taking this game off our shelves altogether, and we're sending the boxes back to Square Enix.
1179458	1181660	That's what should have been done in the first place.
1182100	1185202	If it had been done in the first place, none of this would have ever happened.
1185422	1186763	They wouldn't have had the bad rap.
1186863	1190906	I mean, sure, there'd be people that go, oh, GameStop won't sell Deus Ex on the PC.
1190986	1191466	Too good, huh?
1191486	1191587	But...
1192307	1193188	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1208766	1236936	but what it did is it just brought this whole thing to light of you mean they're opening new things and then reselling them as new like who the fuck does that Best Buy doesn't do that Target doesn't do that Walmart doesn't do that yeah because if you think about it like let's just take it to the extreme here what if they were say there was some bonus download content that came with a game like say Gears of War or something like that comes with like a map pack or something like that and they decide hey you know what we're gonna break open all the copies of Gears of War we're gonna take it out and we're gonna sell that map pack separately
1237336	1256430	and then we're also gonna sell the game as new so it's brought this policy of theirs to light and part of me of course is doing the Nelson laugh pointing and going you know I've been telling you guys for a while this is you know part of their crap policies and so forth but you know whatever I'm sure people will forget about this in a couple weeks and continue to buy their games from there
1256790	1259352	But it was interesting to kind of see that all come to light.
1259512	1262254	And I think the appropriate response was what happened at the end of the day.
1262594	1267818	But unfortunately GameStop is too comfortable with let's open new things and then resell them as new.
1267898	1270079	And finally the public was like wait a minute you can't do that.
1270439	1278585	When I go to Fry's and that's been done there's an open box that's cheaper that I buy because the box has been opened.
1278965	1280627	GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop
1301104	1302225	Oh, no fucking you didn't.
1302466	1304147	We're not going to sell your fucking games anymore.
1304408	1306230	And they're like, oh, wait a second.
1306250	1307651	We'll go ahead and take those games back.
1307691	1308292	We're sorry.
1308532	1309613	We shouldn't have ever done that.
1310074	1314018	And we as the consumer have given GameStop that monopoly.
1314118	1314398	Oh, yeah.
1314839	1317762	And if you want that shit to stop, you need to take it away.
1318082	1319364	You need to take that monopoly away.
1319384	1319684	There is no way.
1320384	1321245	I'm not going to hold my breath.
1321265	1322046	I don't think it's going to happen.
1336684	1338966	They're not the only company out there that sells games.
1339266	1341868	They're not even the best company out there that sells games.
1341948	1345291	It's just something.
1346311	1347392	A product.
1347933	1350695	You can go to a bunch of other stores and buy that product.
1350775	1351215	And guess what?
1351255	1354237	Those stores didn't take out the coupons for OnLive.
1355418	1357900	And it's because they feel that they have this new service.
1358220	1362584	Well, can you wait and see what's going to happen when that new streaming service comes around?
1363885	1365346	That's going to be fun.
1366733	1370875	I think that it might have been on a Bobby Blackwolf show last week or the week before.
1371455	1392343	Someone had called in and said that they had worked at an indie game retail shop and that they offered much better trade-in credit for used games than GameStop did, but they could not get people to shop there because, oh, if I get the game at GameStop, my green dude will get a costume coat for a slightly lighter shade of green.
1392743	1421709	and people eat that shit up they do eat that shit up and it's sad it's sad because that's what they're such a big company now that they can make those deals and those deals ensure more people come to you know those stores and it screws everybody else out and even sometimes you know they'll be like yeah you know we want to have the exclusive on that special edition or whatever or they'll put out some other thing and it's all funded by the publishers because the publishers will do whatever the fuck they want because they're the majority you know if they don't have the GameStop business they
1422429	1422889	Go under.
1423110	1427192	Yeah, if your game's not at GameStop, that's a huge coverage of distribution that you've lost.
1427252	1429874	Let me read this comment in our chatroom at chat.orangelandry.com.
1429894	1435157	Kaijudo in chat says, In GameStop's defense, Square Enix and OnLive were in the wrong on the coupon side.
1435277	1436578	Both parties were not in the right.
1436919	1437859	I actually agree with that.
1437939	1443003	And I do think Square Enix needed to apologize to GameStop because that wasn't cool to include a competitor's coupon.
1443363	1447586	This is truly a case of, though, two wrongs don't make a right because who got hurt in the end?
1447946	1448966	Did Square Enix get hurt?
1449167	1450047	Did GameStop get hurt?
1450287	1450487	No.
1450808	1450908	The...
1451348	1452088	Buyers got hurt.
1452108	1455609	I don't really feel so bad for GameStop because their service is not live.
1456330	1457330	It's not done yet.
1457450	1458330	It's not even launched.
1458390	1459671	It's not even in a beta yet.
1459771	1464612	I don't feel bad for GameStop because they've been opening shit for years and reselling it as new.
1464752	1472034	I understand that, but I'm saying there's no reason they should have had to apologize to them in the first place because it's like saying, oh, I'm going to sell this at Walmart.
1472054	1477076	Walmart's like, oh, well, we're going to take the code out because we're going to come out with our own streaming service five years from now.
1477336	1481540	Oh, well, I'm sorry I didn't confirm with you to see if you have a streaming service coming.
1481961	1483102	I mean, big fucking deal.
1483142	1489148	Yeah, you bought a company and you say it's coming out in the spring of 2012, but is it really going to come out then?
1489188	1491030	I mean, this thing could be delayed to 2013.
1491070	1491430	And really, what...
1494659	1495420	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1517758	1517998	Go ahead.
1519158	1524242	They didn't do this with Portal 2, which came with the Steam integration code.
1525562	1529365	Actually, that does make sense because they're streaming.
1529405	1530285	They're talking about streaming.
1530325	1531946	See if there was some sort of streaming copy.
1532107	1535889	But they also have their digital store that they do sell stuff in.
1537156	1543858	Anyhow, all I got to say is that as long as the consumer continues to give GameStop the monopoly, this shit's going to happen.
1543918	1546178	But GameStop's scared because they're looking five years ahead.
1546678	1548019	And I think they are a little worried.
1548059	1550059	And I think they should be to some extent.
1550499	1552000	Stories like this aren't helping.
1552040	1557321	It's just pushing digital distribution up faster and the life cycle of the GameStop store.
1558381	1559021	Think of it, guys.
1559502	1563763	GameStop is going to go the way of Blockbuster in five to ten years.
1564423	1564823	Think about it.
1565143	1572168	Digital distribution doesn't matter just because it's just another segment of the business that's not going to take over the business.
1572648	1576171	And the reason why is because people like physical copies of things.
1576551	1580314	Some things, though, people can get away with getting digitally, like certain games.
1581154	1582375	I don't care about that.
1582475	1588739	And actually, it's kind of the publisher's fault a little bit because nowadays, hell, they're not even throwing manuals in there.
1588779	1590701	It's just a case with a disc in it, and that's it.
1591681	1595902	Alright, I want to get to this week's news, but let me do a couple more comments from our chatroom.
1596022	1597763	After all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
1598183	1604724	SonicM88 in our chat at chat.orange.radio.com says, I also have a good friend who works at GameStop, so I'm a little partial.
1605204	1606785	And that's in response to something you said earlier.
1606925	1608465	I go to GameStop for the knowledge.
1608785	1611526	Their employees always know the most about gaming.
1613091	1632704	and so yeah you know I think every store is different in that capacity it just kind of depends and there are I mean like I said at the top my always my beef is GameStop has never been the front line employees it's like any other business some of them are jerks and I don't want to shop at those stores but there are some really decent people who work at GameStop and that are very knowledgeable about games
1633044	1639569	However, the bonehead mistakes of management, such as what occurred here, is just going to hurt all those people.
1639830	1641010	And it's unfortunate.
1641030	1644273	And I understand that it's good to have knowledgeable staff at your stores.
1644373	1647916	But at the same time, the consumer needs to educate themselves on games.
1647956	1649357	I mean, you don't go blindly into it.
1649918	1653000	Obviously, if you're going into a game store, you kind of have an idea of what you want.
1653160	1657864	I mean, and we're talking in a day and age where there's the internet.
1657984	1660466	I mean, if you want to educate yourself on anything.
1663373	1664193	Does Dan want a mic?
1666194	1669855	People who come into game stores 99% of the time don't know dick about what they want.
1671035	1671435	Nothing.
1671835	1675616	You know what you want when you go into a game store, but that's because you're an ultra gamer.
1676017	1682418	Most people come in and they're just like, and they come to you and they're like, tell me what's good.
1683159	1684959	That's why there's a GameStop.
1685339	1687580	That's why GameStop even exists.
1688444	1689064	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1718374	1719955	Everyone there knows about all the games.
1722596	1723096	Bring it back.
1723216	1724236	Bring it back, motherfucker.
1724376	1724736	Do it!
1725797	1735120	Well, then those type of people anyway should be shopping at Walmart anyways because they're, you know, brainless drones that will just stumble right in to buy any game that you say is good.
1735140	1736320	Well, right, but exactly.
1736580	1736801	Yes.
1736841	1739582	Well, then they're not going to do the difference and all you have to do is educate yourself.
1739722	1740842	Hey, well, these people are stupid.
1740882	1743123	They're just going to buy whatever you tell them to and they're like, okay.
1743923	1745545	That's why GameStop exists.
1745705	1746926	That's why GameStop makes money.
1746946	1748387	And that's why GameStop's important.
1748667	1751089	Because they've got tremendous pull in the industry.
1751470	1760998	The people who go to Walmart are either just pointing and shooting and hoping for a good game, or it's someone like you who goes, I ain't going to GameStop.
1761058	1765381	I'll just stop by Walmart or Target and hope they have it on the shelf and just bag it.
1767223	1768944	But for the unwashed masses...
1769929	1774613	That's why you hope that you go to a specialty retailer with a crew that knows about games.
1777156	1779398	And there's plenty of other specialty retailers out there.
1779418	1783001	You know, Play and Trade, lots of indies.
1783621	1784242	Right, right, sure.
1784282	1784782	There's a couple.
1785563	1786324	Look at Sacramento.
1787085	1788186	How many Play and Trades do we have?
1789487	1790548	Do we even still have one?
1790828	1791809	Folsom's gone, right?
1791889	1792569	Yeah, Folsom's gone.
1792750	1794231	Okay, and how many indies do we have?
1794852	1795232	Three?
1796013	1796253	A few.
1796273	1796373	A few.
1798624	1799405	There aren't many left.
1799465	1802388	And I think that's terrible because I loved independent game stores.
1802828	1808814	That's the reason I ended up working at GameStop because I was going to use Funco Land at the moment to teach myself to run an independent game store.
1809235	1815321	But the problem is that the Akira wave hit and they just engulfed all the other retailers.
1816002	1819445	And what killed GameStop was when they got EB.
1821377	1848944	because when they got EB there was no incentive to be a better company because they were the fucking company and now they're only competing on an area where they're so concerned about oh the intangible competition of this coupon right OnLive was really really competing with GameStop's non-existent streaming service good job guys way to embrace the added value I'm sure all two dozen people who keep OnLive because of that coupon are going to never go to GameStop again right dipshits
1850572	1855013	Of course, let's also remember that like seven GameStops still sell any amount of PC games anyway.
1855713	1855973	Fuck.
1856173	1856453	I'm done.
1858314	1861434	All right, Dan's rant from the front lines.
1861554	1862655	He's been there in the front.
1863975	1871977	And I do think we need to also fairly, you know, in the chats, there's some chatter in our chat room, fairly slap Square Enix on the wrist here too.
1872137	1874317	They are not without fault in this whole story.
1874417	1876638	Seriously, Final Fantasy XIV, what's going on there?
1878318	1880601	It's really Final Fantasy XIV's fault when all's said and done.
1880621	1882843	But no, seriously, I mean, they do have a responsibility.
1882883	1891030	It was not cool of them to, two days before, spring it on everybody, including the retailers, oh, by the way, we're pushing on live in this.
1891390	1892892	You know, that wasn't cool.
1894453	1902601	You know, I think it's cooler than, you know, say, THQ going, oh, by the way, we have this thing where you have to buy the game new, otherwise you gotta pay $10 to play online.
1902681	1903421	Ha ha ha ha ha!
1903441	1903702	Yeah.
1905183	1906004	Suckas!
1922397	1950896	I still think the problem at the end of the day although I think Dan does make a very good point that they're one of the few places left that's all about the games and the completely clueless can at least kind of have an idea of a place where to go I think even people like that when they hear about this in the mainstream media and it was on CNN it was on CBSNews.com this was picked up by the mainstream media and it's funny we have a story later tonight that's going to get into the lulls about the local news and how they can skew stories and so forth I think when they
1952137	1953939	Do this stuff and communicate it to the masses.
1953999	1956041	The masses are like, oh, GameStop's ripping people off.
1956061	1958084	Well, I'm not going to go there anymore.
1958864	1963830	These people that are completely clueless about their games are also pretty fickle.
1964311	1967575	And I think when they find out that there are other options available to them,
1968055	1991506	you know this is this is a great opportunity for companies like Best Buy um I think Target I'm trying to think of who's been trying to strengthen their gaming lately I know we've heard the reports about the Best Buys doing something and I think um I want to say there was a Target initiative too because they were doing buybacks to games and forth in the end of the day this is going to work out really well for them it's about seizing this opportunity I think so
1993367	1996089	I think Amazon, don't they have new gaming stuff?
1996109	1999752	But Amazon's weird because they're such a huge company, but we never see them.
2000512	2002414	They're just out on the internet.
2002754	2013263	If you listen to what Dana just said about people needing advice on what freaking games to buy, I think that kind of answers the question as to why Amazon will never be the only store.
2013883	2016825	It will always be an option for the people that know what they want.
2016885	2019387	For the people that don't know what they want, Amazon doesn't work.
2019467	2027854	And granted, for the people that I would say listen to our show, I mean, I would hope that a lot of them that are pretty knowledgeable of games that are coming out.
2027874	2031316	But if you're not, I mean, there's message boards out there.
2031356	2034119	You go, hey, you know, I'm interested in blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2034159	2037261	You know, what games would you recommend that I play?
2041608	2057469	Dan's yelling from the living room but we can't hear him so alright let's move on we've talked like for a half hour about GameStop and that whole story last week I want to move on let's move on into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you have been playing Loki we'll start with you tonight since DarkSakura's not here how was your gaming week?
2058090	2058791	Thanks for watching!
2075043	2075943	I'm trying to remember what it was.
2076464	2077864	Vinny Vendy something.
2077884	2078365	I don't know.
2078725	2080486	It's four screens of dodging spikes.
2080566	2084147	And then you hit the top, reverse, and dodge four more screens of spikes.
2084888	2086609	It makes you want to pull your hair out.
2086769	2088149	And I just said, you know what?
2088549	2088850	Fuck it.
2089010	2090290	I know what I get for getting this.
2090590	2092011	I get the whole game upside down.
2092131	2094332	And I don't give a fuck about playing this game again.
2094432	2096093	So that's it.
2096193	2096953	I'm done with that game.
2097174	2097494	And then...
2098214	2099255	It's still a great game, though.
2113462	2114103	Thanks for watching!
2134244	2136084	Some bonus stuff I don't care about.
2136545	2136825	Whatever.
2139166	2141347	Played more Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.
2141387	2144428	I have my first character leveled up to tier 8.
2144928	2146409	My tactical guy.
2146929	2152131	And I guess I've got to start working on some of my other characters.
2152291	2156452	Like my trooper, jet, and battle character.
2158153	2159613	So, very fun game still.
2160174	2162994	And I'm hopefully going to be playing a little bit more co-op on that.
2163855	2165255	Because I haven't gotten a chance to lately.
2165275	2167436	I've been playing lots of Grand Theft Auto still.
2169656	2170116	Still fun.
2170376	2173937	Still trying to win as many games as possible so I can get my ranks up.
2173957	2181959	Because not playing for about six months dropped me about 30 ranks in the Ranked Deathmatch.
2182079	2183460	So that kind of pissed me off a little bit.
2184680	2212203	but uh nothing really I could do there it's just a lot of people um not necessarily beating me but uh played less games so if they you know have a streak of 10 or whatever it counts a lot more than what I get I have to I have to have like a streak of 30 and if I lose one it's just going back just as far so it it sucks because I played so many games um and then what else did I play um
2213806	2214186	Not much.
2214306	2216928	Downloaded my 3DS NES games.
2217548	2219289	So have those on my 3DS now.
2219369	2220070	Still haven't played them though.
2221411	2228815	I'm trying to think if I played something else on the iPod.
2229495	2230756	Nah, that's pretty much it.
2232077	2232417	Alright.
2233918	2235159	Slashpop, how was your gaming week?
2236252	2237792	Mostly World of Warcraft.
2238513	2239653	A lot of World of Warcraft.
2240273	2246995	At the Flynn's Arcade at Disneyland, I got to play R-Type in an actual stand-up machine.
2248856	2252677	Just as hard as it is on the Super NES and every other incarnation of R-Type that's ever existed.
2254638	2262846	Also, the classic, I think this may even predate Street Fighter 1 by Capcom, which was an awful game.
2263286	2265468	But Konami's, I think it's Kung Fu Master.
2266029	2269972	If anyone remembers that game, you're the little guy in the little white gi with the black belt.
2269992	2271834	Don't you mean Yara Kung Fu or something like that?
2271914	2272515	Isn't that what it's called?
2272535	2273636	Yeah, it's Konami Fighter.
2273656	2274757	I think it's Yara Kung Fu.
2275237	2277359	Yeah, and I think the very first...
2278500	2304186	um villain or combatant is like this big chunky dude bald-headed that that game um I used to play the hell out of that game at the pizza parlor when I was in junior high because you know we all played video games at pizza parlors back then um so yeah those two games were what I focused on it at Flynn's Arcade there wasn't a lot there that really you know struck stuck out to me if they had they had gauntlet and a bunch of other stuff but um
2305931	2306511	DarkSakura's Machine
2324958	2325238	Why?
2325319	2327480	Oh, that's very appropriate for her not being here.
2327721	2328521	Why Angry Birds?
2328581	2330363	I don't understand the allure of this game.
2330563	2336308	Why does America have, and I'm assuming the rest of the world too, this sick fascination with Angry Birds?
2336849	2337349	It's boring.
2338670	2339071	I don't know.
2339231	2340312	I am with you.
2340432	2340872	I've played it.
2341213	2341593	It was alright.
2341733	2342714	It was kind of neat.
2342894	2344175	Yeah, it's a physics puzzler.
2344956	2346718	And you launch birds into things and you...
2349547	2350608	I'm not obsessed about it.
2351288	2352589	I was like, eh, it was alright.
2352609	2354311	It was a cheap iPod game.
2354411	2358414	As far as these iPod games go, I like Cut the Rope, but I wouldn't buy the guy on a t-shirt.
2360196	2363038	While I was at Disneyland, I saw a ton of Angry Birds t-shirts.
2363078	2365400	They're making a fucking movie based on this.
2365720	2366121	Why?
2366921	2367362	Why?
2368082	2371006	Oh, I know why, because Hollywood's really run out of ideas.
2371106	2372687	I mean, it's like, let's make a game.
2372707	2382017	I don't know if it's in our show role, but Uwe Boll is making a movie based on some, like, a Doom clone.
2382358	2385241	No, it didn't make our show role, because I saw Uwe Boll, and I was like...
2385541	2386422	It's like some Doom clone.
2386442	2387582	It's like you would never know.
2388783	2394646	I didn't realize this obscure game is... It's basically an excuse for him to make a zombie movie.
2394686	2397188	He's like, okay, what game's a zombie thing?
2397248	2399449	Okay, I'm going to base my movie on this.
2399549	2402131	All right, but we're digressing.
2402331	2405733	So, Salacious Pop, you're playing Angry Birds right now.
2406053	2406994	Justify yourself.
2408875	2409615	Look at your life.
2409675	2410316	Look at your choices.
2410336	2410696	Yeah, I know.
2413182	2415663	It really takes just no brain power to play this game.
2415683	2417004	You have unlimited retries.
2417024	2420847	You just fling birds at shit until you kill all the pigs.
2421367	2422148	That's the whole game.
2422928	2424329	I have no room to talk.
2424850	2426871	This is a game I've been playing this week.
2426891	2430334	It didn't hit the pig when I aimed it high, so let's aim it low and try it again.
2430434	2432295	Oh, I did it.
2433596	2436158	It's now three in the morning and your iPhone is out of battery life.
2436338	2436718	I don't know.
2436758	2437239	I don't get it.
2437979	2442201	But yeah, that and also, I need to look up the name of it.
2442321	2454888	For those listening who enjoy Bust a Move or Puzzle Bobble, as it is more appropriately called, there is a clone of that game on Google Plus called Bubble.
2454968	2456629	Is that a rip off of Wurbs right there?
2458358	2459779	Um, I'm not sure.
2460579	2462100	It had monkeys in it.
2462120	2463820	What was that monster world?
2463860	2465481	That character looked hideous.
2466141	2471403	That was like a divine, but not even, like Charlie the Tuna dressed in drag.
2471483	2472144	What was that?
2472244	2474265	Like a monster world or something like that?
2474285	2474785	Alright, forget it.
2476186	2482510	It's called Bubble Island, and there's this little raccoon, and it plays exactly like Puzzle Bobble, Bust a Move.
2482970	2491056	So if you like those games and have Google+, you can't really spam the shit out of people on Google+, and also Facebook has copied that format.
2491096	2493197	It all goes to a totally separate tab.
2493337	2498400	If you want to support indie developers, all they can do is make fucking clones of really awesome games.
2499401	2501302	Just, you know, the cash in, then go right ahead.
2501322	2503263	What is that iPhone developer, Gameloft or whatever?
2503784	2506145	They thrive on ripping games off and they do it really well.
2506205	2507266	Yeah, but that's the thing.
2507486	2508747	They do it really well.
2508867	2511749	I mean, and to the point where... They fucking got wow on an iPhone.
2511789	2513690	It's pretty amazing, I gotta say.
2514210	2514630	It's sad.
2514710	2515491	It's like, you know...
2516691	2521034	It would be like having Spielberg doing remakes of something.
2521134	2526036	We have some Angry Birds defenders in our chat room at chat.org.com and every gamer does get a voice here.
2526757	2529278	Actdeft says Angry Birds is fun, not the best game ever.
2529978	2533820	Izam says Angry Birds is just something you can let your mind go numb on and waste time with.
2534300	2536001	Kaijudo says Angry Birds is the best.
2536061	2537582	We all love to knock down stuff.
2538482	2541464	Actdeft says Angry Birds is fun because of the cute destruction.
2541604	2542364	It happens in the game.
2542665	2543685	It's also like a puzzler.
2543825	2545166	So people like to knock things over.
2546406	2547687	I guess that's the allure of Jenga.
2548847	2549167	I don't know.
2549587	2550848	Alright, so Angry Birds, fine.
2551348	2551808	Anything else?
2551868	2554689	Angry Birds, wow, the two games at Flynn's Arcade and that?
2555209	2560011	Oh, um, I play your 3DS when you're at work and I'm bored.
2561152	2561992	What games on 3DS?
2562532	2565393	Metroid, Ice Climbers, Zelda 2.
2565473	2566534	Oh, the Ambassador games?
2566674	2567274	Yeah, the Ambassador games.
2567294	2571675	Were you kind of doing that thing where you'd play them for five minutes and you'd go, yep, it's Zelda, and then switch to another game?
2572136	2572356	Yeah.
2574116	2577058	Do you feel yourself needing to yell at Zelda 2?
2577098	2581001	So why is this game so damn annoying?
2582442	2584103	Dude, games like that were easier when I was 9.
2584783	2585604	Look, look, look, there it is.
2586724	2587845	Did you see that character?
2588025	2588866	What the hell was that?
2590262	2593446	Monster Island, Charlie the Tuna, Drag
2605802	2611527	Moving on, I want to talk about my gaming week, of which actually, since I was out of town, I don't have a whole lot to talk about.
2611587	2618694	Flynn's Arcade, I played Frogger, I don't know why, much to Loki's dismay, I love to play old school Frogger in an actual arcade machine.
2618714	2623599	Don't get me wrong, old school Frogger is cool, I just don't see the need of the constant remakes of Frogger.
2623759	2624199	I'm with you there.
2624219	2624840	Because they weren't good.
2625080	2626400	and I played Donkey Kong Jr.
2626561	2649248	like I've just been I don't know like I wanted to play that in the arcade hella bad and then funny you could download that on your I know ironically enough that ended up being one of the 3ds ambassador games and I played it there too and one of my whole like fun but it's funny I played it not even a day after I played the arcade version and I could really see the difference like right away not like graphically but just in how the game was a little easier on the NES than it was in the arcade that's for sure but that's yeah you can't
2650328	2655593	Like, if you fall even a little bit from one platform to a platform that's underneath you, you die.
2655773	2655913	Yeah.
2656074	2661419	You can't, there's no... Yeah, it has to be, you can do like a slight fall, but not very much.
2661439	2667264	Because I'm thinking it's like Mario, where if it's not a pit, where it just goes off the bottom of the screen, you can just jump down there, no, you die.
2667624	2667785	Nope.
2668005	2668165	Yeah.
2669201	2669962	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2692438	2704962	Me and two of my friends from the Bay Area started up a game at 8 o'clock on Friday night and it was like 2.15 in the morning and we were like, oh my god, it's like after 1, we should probably go to bed, so we need to save the game.
2705282	2709544	And I don't even know if we're going to be able to recover from the save, because I couldn't save the game.
2709744	2711284	Only the host could save the game.
2711444	2719767	So I really hope we are able to restore from that save game or it's going to be very sad, but at the same time it was a lot of fun and just goes to show how freaking addicting that game was.
2720407	2745773	but um it was it was neat like I found that my two friends are very expansionistic whereas I'm more about get five cities and make them just fucking fortresses and build them up as best you can it's the year you know 1700 and they have laser beam technology or whatever yeah actually yeah we had riflemen in the year 1500 we had to end the game around like 1600 of course we were on kind of dumb dumb difficulty because we didn't want the computer to kick our ass too much so I don't know
2746073	2763542	I love Civilization and the Civilization series and Civ 5 is my favorite since the original so nothing will ever top the original to me because I'm just stuck up that way but Civ 5 is pretty freaking great and I'm having a lot of fun playing that online and I want to do that again
2764142	2765483	Any iPhone games you've been playing?
2766804	2769126	Tiny Tower, which, whatever.
2769466	2769967	Shut up.
2770007	2770467	Don't taunt me.
2771208	2771768	I will say this.
2771928	2777533	I've also been, besides Civ V and stuff, and light console stuff here and there.
2777553	2780055	Keep in mind, guys, my Xbox is still out of commission.
2780115	2780675	Remember the hack?
2780995	2781736	It's been three weeks.
2782176	2783377	I need to call Xbox tomorrow.
2783397	2783918	Where's my money?
2784558	2785279	If they're even open.
2785319	2785979	It's Labor Day.
2786019	2786340	I don't know.
2788181	2790743	So I only really have a PS3, and I was gone for most of the weeks.
2790763	2793065	That's why my gaming week was a little bit sad.
2793425	2798393	But I will say this, on Facebook, speaking of sad, I have got sucked into Sims Social.
2799074	2800917	I'm hanging my head in shame, allowing you all to judge me.
2800937	2801899	I'm shaking my head in shame.
2802099	2802400	I know.
2802560	2803542	SMH, SMH.
2803722	2804103	It's just...
2805436	2832741	it's I will say this it's a pretty darn good ripoff of The Sims and you know I think everybody got addicted to The Sims at some point not like there's definitely varying levels of difficulty but okay why are you giving a big thumbs down slash spot it was like a year maybe even two years after The Sims 1 which came out what 2000 2001 came out it it had beaten Myst as like the top selling PC game ever I played it for a weekend I did not get it
2833283	2834383	I thought it was so boring.
2853331	2875346	and of course here's the thing I think they've done a good job of translating the Sims into a Facebook game even though the whole energy thing is very limiting but what can you do the game's free you know there's got to be some limits but here's the thing I think SimSocial is also like everything you fucking hate about a Facebook game is in this game like the spam on people's walls
2875846	2895226	and ask all your friends for a cookie or whatever and all this stuff like it's just bullshit like how much this game fucks up your Facebook wall and this is why people hate Facebook games like I really want SimSocial to be on Google Plus because I don't think it will be because it can't be as invasive on Google Plus
2895734	2897255	You're grinning over there, SalaciousPop.
2897835	2901057	I have not added SimSocial to my Facebook in any way.
2901217	2904238	So I don't technically have it installed or whatever it's called.
2904699	2916365	But if I go to my games tab on Facebook, there's at least 10 people that I know very well in real life that are like, join SimSocial and send me a little fluffy pillow because I'm trying to renovate my living room and I need it for my couch.
2916385	2916985	Send me a pillow.
2917145	2918546	And I just want to say like, no.
2919246	2921387	I'll send you fire to burn down your goddamn house.
2921547	2922368	Stop bothering me.
2923703	2924784	They actually do have Fury.
2924804	2925824	Anyway.
2926905	2929887	But yeah, this is why people hate Facebook games.
2929967	2932368	It is the fastest growing game since Farmville, though.
2933249	2934009	It's the biggest.
2934390	2936451	It's going to be the biggest Facebook game since Farmville.
2937111	2937492	Guaranteed.
2937612	2939493	Don't you have to mow your lawn to earn points?
2939873	2940334	DarkSakura.com
2957549	2957729	Right?
2957749	2958949	And what was she telling us about her friend?
2958969	2960590	Like her friend is afraid to leave the house.
2960730	2967931	She was going on vacation and she had to give her daughter, because I think this was a retired aged woman, had to give her 60 or 70 year old woman.
2967951	2969211	My mom is 71.
2969271	2975933	Had to give her grown daughter her Facebook password so that her daughter could log in once or twice a day to click on all of the Farmville.
2975953	2976573	To feed her chickens.
2976593	2977393	To feed the chickens.
2977453	2978393	Or they might die.
2978753	2983294	Yeah, because she didn't want her farm to lose the progression of points when she was on vacation.
2983314	2983915	Not real chickens.
2984175	2984355	Yeah.
2984575	2985235	Farmville chickens.
2986315	2989498	I mean, that's like what these games have become to some people.
2990959	2997264	And if the chickens ever do die, she could just take out a credit card and buy $5 worth of Zynga bucks and just respawn her chickens.
2997485	2998285	That's how they make money.
3000087	3000507	Womp womp.
3003340	3005843	I'm very proud of my mother for not getting sucked into all that.
3005903	3007345	She's very staunch.
3007705	3009007	I'm not getting on Facebook.
3009127	3010509	No one wants to see my face.
3011470	3013853	I don't know if I should say this on the show.
3016136	3017017	Don't ask.
3017357	3018358	Do not ask me.
3018999	3019680	She's on Twitter.
3019960	3020981	She's got a Twitter account.
3022582	3045049	and she asked me how to upload her picture to her Twitter account and she's following like Rosie and what Cher and stuff on Twitter and it's really cute but yeah she doesn't want me I told her I would plug her Twitter and would get her some followers but she doesn't want it she doesn't she gets creeped out by people following so don't try to find her guys she doesn't want to be found so but she's on there and it's really really funny so
3046790	3052579	I'm proud of my mother for finally embracing technology because for the longest time she was one of those people that thought the CD-ROM drive was a coaster.
3052860	3054382	Why are you paying $200 for the coaster?
3055804	3057928	Anyway, let's move on then.
3057968	3059230	That's it for our gaming weeks.
3060256	3060916	Housekeeping.
3060976	3062037	Join us on Facebook.

3072720	3074280	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

3077261	3078421	You can find us there on Twitter.
3080062	3080582	I guess that's it.
3081622	3097769	Let's get into this week's gaming news After plenty of talk of last week's news and our antics this week Let's finally talk about what's going on this week Loki, start us off This weekend was the Call of Duty XP event in LA It was kind of their Call of Duty con, if you will Where they were talking about
3098589	3121040	The new Elite Service and also the Hardened Edition of Modern Warfare 3 So the first thing we're going to talk about real quick is the Hardened Edition Which thankfully this year it is only one special edition No Prestige this time around, no RC car that's way overpriced Or some cheap ass night vision goggles that really are just some toys
3121980	3135585	This time you get basically the game plus a field guide that's over 100 pages, some avatar clothes or animated theme if you're on the PlayStation Network.
3136245	3145828	Also, one year of Call of Duty Elite membership, which is apparently a $50 value, and all that's going to run you $80.
3145868	3145948	Okay.
3150034	3161244	And I have to say, I did watch at least a part of their streaming coverage of when they were talking about the multiplayer and the elite service.
3161485	3170853	And I gotta say, man, they really have got their shit together as far as how to do an online community and how to give the fans what they want for that.
3170933	3171033	It's...
3171994	3174395	It's kind of interesting because, like, you know what?
3174955	3177096	They're not going to do too bad without Infinity Ward.
3177456	3179457	I mean, the old Infinity Ward.
3179477	3184859	There's still Infinity Ward putting the game out, but it's not all the old people from Infinity Ward.
3184899	3191281	But they got their shit together as far as online computing, and that's really what's going to stand them apart from Battlefield 3.
3191341	3192501	Can you elaborate a little more?
3192542	3192962	Like, why?
3193002	3193782	Why is it so awesome?
3194045	3196927	Well, there's a bunch of stuff that they offer for free.
3197287	3198147	It's all on disc.
3198228	3200069	Basically, you can create clans.
3202370	3203751	It links in with Facebook.
3203791	3208173	You can find your friends on Facebook and be able to play games with them.
3208253	3216278	You can join up groups that are necessarily... Say, for example, I'm a fan of the Giants or something like that.
3216618	3220841	I can play with other Call of Duty players that are fans of the San Francisco Giants or whatever.
3221441	3221661	So...
3223106	3223966	Not that I'm a Giants fan.
3224006	3224526	I hate sports.
3226947	3228107	But they have that kind of stuff.
3228167	3230027	They have where you can break down.
3231368	3234708	You can see what other players' loadouts are.
3234968	3238249	Say, for example, you're playing against somebody and somebody kills you.
3238829	3242090	You can pull up all this information, all the hotspots on the map.
3242730	3244150	You can see what their loadout was.
3244170	3245631	You can try their loadout if you want.
3245691	3247471	You can create your own game modes.
3247491	3249191	You can upload those, share them with friends.
3249451	3250132	They can tweak them.
3250152	3252012	They can share them back again.
3252772	3259835	You can capture 30 second clips and post them up in HD to share with friends.
3260375	3266378	You can compete in tournaments for real prizes.
3266598	3268339	Of course, that's the paid service.
3269099	3272321	And they're going to have different tournaments based on people's skill levels.
3272481	3276982	So it's not going to be just all crazy Call of Duty elite players and stuff like that.
3279950	3307535	they also with the elite service you're going to be able to get all the download content for free and you're going to be able to get it first so they're going to put out download content every month instead of every quarter like they normally do everybody else that's not paying for the elite service or doesn't buy the hardened edition you have to pay for that separately and that's $60 if you were to buy all that on top of the membership or without the membership I guess
3308135	3311117	So, lots of, it's just, it was interesting.
3311297	3321024	And lots of different, you know, game modes, and basically just kind of, they retweaked, you know, their whole perk system and stuff like that, and it just sounded interesting.
3321084	3334713	For someone that, I'm not really into the series at all, I mean, it's just, for me, it feels like if I hadn't been playing the first one, and hadn't been playing Solid, like, you know, like I do with Grand Theft Auto, I don't really feel comfortable playing Modern Warfare 3.
3334753	3337255	Even though I probably could, it's just, you know,
3339035	3342836	Some of those players play Call of Duty like I play Grand Theft Auto.
3343196	3345016	Yeah, DDR Dollar Bill in our chatroom is with you.
3345096	3347577	I'm just not interested in the Call of Duty series.
3347657	3358258	And I'm not really into those games as well, but I can also see, I recognize that they're huge games in the industry and that, more importantly, where this succeeds, other games might follow.
3358318	3361339	Do you see something like this coming to other games in the future?
3361379	3361719	I hope so.
3361759	3363859	I would love this for Grand Theft Auto.
3364039	3364760	It would be awesome.
3365120	3367280	There's not that many people that play Grand Theft Auto multiplayer.
3367660	3395447	which I hope changes with the next one but you know whenever that may be sooner than you think I think next year for sure but I mean it would be great I would love that kind of stuff and they kind of had something sort of like that with the whole social club with Rockstar Games and stuff but it's not really in game it's more of just you go to a website and you can interact with all the stuff whereas this is actually in the game you can do all that before with Black Ops I guess you could do that
3396427	3403574	on the website but now it's actually in the game and you can do everything that you can on the website which is pretty awesome.
3405919	3407500	So yeah, I hope they do that.
3408560	3409720	As long as it delivers on what they said.
3409941	3415883	Because honestly, prior to this information, I would have said Battlefield 3 is probably going to be the better game.
3415963	3423065	And I still think they're two different types of games, but Battlefield 3 looks really good.
3423525	3430248	So if they have some decent multiplayer community features and stuff like that, it still might be...
3430888	3431348	Thanks for watching!
3451201	3452841	Um... You don't have to make a choice.
3453862	3454182	Whatever.
3455883	3457144	So some other things they talked about.
3457164	3459285	I'll go with the Elite stuff real quick.
3460045	3460606	Mobile apps.
3460766	3470691	They're going to be putting out some mobile apps so you can check out what your friends are doing and make all those tweaks and stuff on your iPod or iPhone or your Android or whatever PC.
3471611	3472952	So they're going to have that as well.
3474373	3474453	Um...
3476593	3477453	Other fun stuff.
3478854	3479254	Let's see.
3480634	3483815	Here's basically the bonuses that they're going to offer the customers.
3483835	3488116	The first, subscribers will get a year's worth of download content for Modern Warfare 3.
3488717	3490797	And they're saying it's over 20 pieces of content.
3491137	3495079	And they're going to be putting out monthly content drops instead of quarterly.
3495499	3498900	And that will include new maps, new game modes, with the value being $60.
3499320	3506062	Elite subscribers will have access to daily and weekly competitions and events, which will offer both real and virtual prizes.
3507102	3510424	Subscribers will be able to level up their clans in competition.
3510604	3512165	So that's kind of cool.
3513206	3518729	And also they'll have 8 times more video sharing capacity than standard users.
3519469	3523872	They'll have access to expert strategy and analysis including tips on guns, maps, perks, whatever.
3524132	3529695	That was one of the other things I kind of liked is you can level up your proficiencies on different weapons.
3529835	3534138	So instead of just leveling up your character, if I use like a P90 all the time I would
3534358	3535879	Elite TV Premium Service
3551067	3552527	Friday Night Fights NoobTube NoobTube
3575037	3579320	They're going to have people making commentary on them, including Will Arnett and Jason Bateman.
3579340	3583103	They're going to be smack-talking over, I guess, user-created videos from the game.
3583363	3584444	So, I mean, that's kind of cool.
3585044	3587246	That's definitely unique content, I would say.
3587806	3589427	But, you know, is it for everybody?
3589487	3594031	You know, is it for, like, someone that, you know, like me that's not really in the Call of Duty series?
3594311	3594851	Eh, probably not.
3595232	3598254	But it's definitely some stuff to kind of go, hey, that's kind of neat.
3598314	3599114	I'll have to check that out.
3599375	3601216	And a lot of this stuff was for free.
3601296	3602197	You know, you don't have to...
3602857	3603317	XBOX 360 BUNDLE
3628386	3654737	320GB hard drive also custom startup and loading disk sounds and that'll be I guess they're also going to say those controllers are also available separately for $60 and they're going to be doing a new headset which is also coming out non-branded Modern Warfare 3 for $70 that also is a Bluetooth headset those are the new Microsoft headsets
3654997	3655918	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3677478	3678759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3696718	3700841	I think either you have your thing or none of it's really interesting to you.
3700881	3702462	You play a variety of games.
3703383	3709347	Like I said, $50 a year may not be your thing, especially if you're already paying for live.
3709647	3710868	That's already money out of your pocket.
3711628	3713829	A lot of the services on there are free.
3714049	3717589	So, I mean, check out at least a free portion of it because why not?
3717709	3720810	I mean, if you're playing it, it sounds like it'd be a good value.
3721270	3727192	See, but I don't really think a lot of people need expert tips or need to watch Will Arnett make fun of videos.
3727272	3729712	I mean, no one really needs that.
3730732	3736414	And the download content bonus is kind of cool because you're saving some money if you're planning on buying all the download content.
3736434	3737334	Yeah.
3738769	3742752	I mean, they're just trying to make money on the digital end because they're making a lot of money on the digital side.
3743132	3750918	And then, once again, you know, the only thing that kind of leaves a sour taste in my mouth would be, you know, the fact that this company puts it out as Activision.
3750958	3757203	So, yeah, it's like, yeah, do I really want to support Activision?
3758804	3764409	I will say, though, you know, again, I'm not really into this series, but I'm looking at the screenshot of the, you know, hardened edition.
3764989	3766130	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3790211	3794635	Also of note, it sounds like this Call of Duty Expo thing was kind of a success for them too.
3794675	3795395	Oh yeah, I think so.
3795656	3796837	Definitely they'll be doing it next year.
3797237	3798198	So, very interesting.
3798398	3799158	Whatever the next game is.
3799339	3801400	Alright, well let's shift gears a little bit and talk about Nintendo.
3801460	3802962	They are doing an event of their own.
3803002	3807345	Now, you know, Nintendo does not usually participate in the Tokyo Game Show.
3807966	3810548	They don't usually go, and that's no new news.
3811289	3815292	They're not going this year either, but they are going to be doing a special press conference.
3815512	3817333	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3837364	3837965	It might be true.
3838085	3839747	Nintendo's always working on something.
3840188	3841730	All the game companies are working on something.
3841830	3846476	You bet your ass Sony's working on PlayStation 4 even though they're not showing it for five more years.
3847137	3848759	That's going to piss off a lot of people.
3848979	3851482	You think that price drop pissed off a lot of people?
3851883	3854346	Putting out a new system with six months?
3854606	3854706	With
3855367	3856748	with the holidays still to come.
3857008	3860231	I have no doubt Nintendo is working on the next 3DS model for 2012 or 2013.
3860431	3862993	I don't think it's coming out this year.
3863313	3864634	Take it from the PSP.
3864774	3870819	They're not going to add another second analog stick because now you're going to have games that are only going to work on the one system and not the old 3DS.
3871039	3874302	Well, there was talk about having an add-on that would plug in.
3874362	3878325	I don't know how it would work, but it would plug into the existing DS and give you the extra analog stick.
3878945	3879826	It could work.
3880026	3880887	I could see how they could do it.
3881367	3885130	You could plug something into the back there like where the charger usually goes and kind of have it reach...
3885470	3885690	What?
3885810	3886391	You're grinning.
3886611	3893195	That reminds me of the Logitech rumor that they were making a UMD accessory for the PlayStation Go.
3893415	3895437	That's kind of funny, huh?
3895497	3896978	I'm grinning because it reminded me of that story.
3897018	3897438	But here's the thing.
3897458	3898499	I think people are freaking out.
3898799	3902461	Nintendo doing a press conference before Tokyo Game Show is nothing new.
3902662	3905243	They do this all the time because they don't participate in Tokyo Game Show.
3905563	3907445	And what does Nintendo have going for them right now?
3907465	3909726	I already told you they're not going to show the Wii U again.
3909766	3911527	And I bet you that wasn't at PAX, was it?
3911808	3912668	I don't think so.
3912708	3914069	That's one thing I did call, right?
3915390	3916251	There's nothing to show.
3916291	3917231	They don't have anything.
3917251	3918592	It's like a proof of concept still.
3918632	3919393	Yeah, exactly.
3919433	3920393	It's too soon.
3920833	3922995	So they're not showing it now either.
3923135	3924876	And they're not taking it to a game show and it's not this.
3924896	3926537	So what else does Nintendo have going on right now?
3926797	3927397	The 3DS.
3927878	3932280	So this is probably where they're going to announce what we have to look forward to in 2012.
3932921	3933841	Whatever that might be.
3934002	3934382	I don't know.
3935222	3936483	It's probably too early to say.
3937684	3940906	But I don't think a redo of the 3DS is one of them.
3941386	3968459	now if, here's what I am here's what they could do is if it's true that they're going that direction they could announce the plug at this like whatever plug is going to give you that second analog stick, they could announce that, and if that's announced then you fucking know a new system's coming out in 2012, but I just my gut tells me no, I think they still have to really prove this, you know it's kind of like one of those, they've put it out there
3969019	3969639	Thanks for watching!
3990030	3992152	People will live.
3992813	3994975	The PSP did just fine with one analog stick.
3995015	4001823	Granted, it sucked that some games had to use the buttons to have a second analog stick.
4001843	4002323	But you know what?
4002844	4008129	We can use the touchpad as much as I hate doing it as a second analog stick.
4008510	4011253	Or just make games that don't require a second analog stick.
4011913	4018235	Gripper01 in our chatroom says, pretty assuredly, he says, it's a mother collection for the 3DS.
4018655	4019535	I wish.
4019815	4021015	I wish, my friend.
4021495	4022116	I don't think so.
4022376	4024576	Yeah, they're going to be announcing that also.
4024616	4027277	It's going to be bundled with Lastorian.
4029477	4029977	I would say so.
4029997	4036059	They're probably just going to focus on Kingdom Hearts, maybe give a date for Kid Icarus and some of the stuff we already know about.
4036919	4039602	and maybe like a new Nintendo franchise for 2012.
4039642	4043385	There right now are no dates for Kid Icarus and the two Mario games.
4043545	4045127	Well then maybe that's what we're going to hear.
4045147	4046528	We're going to get some dates finally.
4046588	4047929	I think that's what you're going to get out of this.
4048310	4052493	And maybe a teaser of some Nintendo franchise coming back on the DS in 2012.
4053434	4054515	F-Zero Actraiser 3
4074838	4075218	Thanks for watching!
4092651	4100037	They came out the night before they were supposed to, and I think that's because it was the first in Japan, but it was like the 31st of August here.
4100517	4115328	And the full list of games that you can get for free, NES games, Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong Jr., Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, Legend of Zelda, Metroid, NES Open Tournament Golf, Wrecking Crew, Yoshi, and Zelda II, The Adventure of Link.
4115769	4116990	Those are the games that came out.
4117050	4121173	Yoshi, by the way, is not Yoshi's cookie, but it's a different puzzler.
4121253	4122254	It's kind of crap.
4122694	4128078	It's the one where Mario was on the bottom and you can flip the things around and you line up the characters and little Yoshi eggs.
4128659	4129259	It's bad.
4129319	4129820	I played it.
4129860	4131581	I was like, ooh, this was not a good puzzler game.
4131781	4136926	They kept trying to, it's like, they had really good success with Tetris and then Dr. Mario back to back.
4136946	4139287	Isn't it a Columns clone and Columns isn't very good either?
4140368	4142490	I guess it's kind of like Columns, but not really.
4143451	4147154	Mario's at the bottom and he flips these platters around and that's what you're doing.
4147194	4147634	But I don't know.
4147674	4148715	I don't want to talk too much about Yoshi.
4148755	4149496	It's not worth your time.
4149536	4151077	They really should have just done Dr. Mario.
4151385	4156570	See, but you have five, I would say in that list, you have like five epic Nintendo games.
4157011	4167021	Mario Brothers, Zelda, Zelda 2, Metroid, and out of Donkey Kong Jr., Balloon Fight, and Ice Climber, probably one of those you go, that's epic too.
4168002	4168903	Some of these speak to your interest.
4169064	4170565	And then the rest of those, stinkers.
4171386	4173168	But, you know, whatever.
4174449	4179735	Again, I still to this day say Nintendo really didn't have to do anything.
4180536	4183279	So for them, I mean, when you early adopt, this is the risk you take.
4183900	4187764	And so I think it's neat that the games are out and that I didn't have to pay for them.
4188305	4189847	And I look forward to the advanced games as well.
4190588	4192950	But having Metroid in my pocket is kind of rad, not going to lie.
4193511	4193972	It's kind of nice.
4195715	4201339	Looking forward to seeing how that multiplayer and all that stuff pulls out because it might make a game like Ice Climber way more fun to be able to actually play that.
4201359	4202300	Are they adding that later on?
4202500	4202860	I think so.
4202880	4204201	They were supposed to be doing that for the NES.
4204241	4205182	Same room, multiplayer.
4206283	4210366	But no longer with the chords that you had on the Game Boy old school and all that.
4211566	4232979	and then of course as I already mentioned there are rumors about a redesigned 3DS it's coming from a French website 01.net and normally you would write that off as oh well who cares it's just some website doesn't know what they're talking about however I believe this is the same website that talked about what else did they blow the lid on before they broke the Wii U and they broke the PS Vita and those specs
4233439	4237740	So it's kind of one of those, they were right on these, so take this or leave this.
4238040	4241221	But that's where the whole rumor of the second stick comes from.
4241581	4248082	The second analog stick rumor for the PSP original plagued that console for years and years.
4248823	4252043	There were leaked photos, and they were all fake.
4252083	4254684	I can see them doing it if they want to do an XL or something like that.
4255504	4256264	That doesn't piss me off.
4256464	4256764	Big deal.
4256924	4257845	So it has a larger screen.
4259005	4259505	I'll get over that.
4260270	4263814	But the change is so much to where, oh, we're going to put a second analog.
4264936	4267418	Come on, that's going to piss people off.
4267579	4270282	Yeah, it's like the expression, you've made your bed, now lie in it.
4270382	4274467	Final Fantasy XIV, they're not just coming out with a new game.
4274738	4283889	Yeah, I mean, it's just like, well, shouldn't this have been part of the... It's just like, it's not as bad as like Wii Motion Plus or something like that, but it is pretty bad.
4284049	4289215	It's like, yeah, we really should have had these extra sensors in there, but we want to drop the cost of this.
4289876	4290797	But now we're just like...
4291758	4306175	and we're gonna fuck you guys so um what made them change their mind though if this is true I still I still I mean I realize this website has a record and so forth you know people have said the same thing about us like why believe them when we were right on something early but um
4307316	4307657	I don't know.
4307957	4309778	There's still a big grain of salt I'm taking this with.
4309818	4312600	But I feel like, well, why would they suddenly change their mind?
4312700	4313800	Maybe it's developer pressure?
4314501	4319143	Maybe because the lack of games... There's been a lack of games in the beginning here.
4319263	4326348	Maybe it's because they're worried they're not going to be able to port the hardcore games over some of these first-person shooters or whatever.
4326908	4327749	Like a Call of Duty.
4329349	4331771	Modern Warfare 3 is not going to be able to be on that because...
4332352	4336173	We're not going to be sitting here after Christmas going, there's a lack of games on the 3DS.
4337173	4337873	How could you be?
4337953	4342655	You have Mario Kart, Mario, Kid Icarus, all coming out by the end of the year.
4342695	4343735	And a bunch of third party stuff.
4343755	4347056	Those are pretty strong games, and it's going to be enough for the 3DS.
4347116	4349916	Granted, it should have been what the system launched with, but whatever.
4349936	4353677	3DS is going to be in a much better position come December than it is currently.
4354478	4355098	You know what I mean?
4355158	4357658	I feel like there's no games for 3DS.
4357978	4359979	That argument's going to get old at the end of the year.
4361710	4369114	And it's going to be difficult to... I wouldn't think that they would announce a revision to their system right before the holiday.
4369974	4372835	Yeah, that would be shooting yourself in the foot, for real.
4373155	4374576	That would be just dumb of them to do.
4374956	4384261	But again, like I said a minute ago, they could be working on that, and this French website might be right, but that doesn't mean that's what they're announcing before the Tokyo Game Show.
4384681	4388323	Nintendo always does a press conference before the Tokyo Game Show because they don't participate.
4388383	4389263	I'll tell you what they're doing.
4391223	4392184	They're doing some sort of bundle.
4393245	4395787	It's like, oh, look, it's a Mario console with Mario.
4396928	4397368	Okay, yeah.
4397388	4397969	I mean, that makes sense.
4397989	4398309	I'm with you.
4398429	4399230	Yeah, absolutely.
4399250	4400831	Didn't they already announce something like that?
4401011	4402613	They announced a red console.
4403133	4404574	Yeah, a bundle.
4404674	4405075	Makes sense.
4405135	4405555	Perfect sense.
4405916	4408778	And I think there will be a tease of a new game in 2012.
4409058	4409399	Yeah.
4410640	4412261	We still have that Smash Brothers game.
4412741	4413342	I want to play.
4413842	4414463	And this is weird.
4414783	4416505	I want to play that Lego City Stories.
4417728	4420750	I don't fucking care if it's made by Rockstar Games, I'll play that shit.
4420770	4421371	Alright, fair enough.
4436930	4442375	By the way, we have some comments in our chatroom going back to talking about the games that were in the Ambassador Pack.
4443856	4444777	Let's see, Balloon Fight.
4445577	4447359	Actdeft says, Balloon Fight is awesome.
4447499	4450101	And SonicM88 says, I love Balloon Fight.
4450422	4453324	And Orange Right says, Balloon Fight is only good for balloon trips.
4453364	4458548	There's a lot of love for Balloon Fight in the chat and some in the middle of the road.
4458608	4462492	But yeah, Balloon Fight, if you've never played it, is basically Nintendo's joust ripoff.
4462992	4465714	You know Joust, the game where you flap the little birdie?
4465754	4466734	It's like that, but with balloons.
4467074	4474599	But yeah, what made the game stand out was that it had this mode called Balloon Trip, where now imagine Joust as a side-scrolling game.
4476100	4477320	That's what Balloon Trip is.
4477801	4480282	Except it scrolls the wrong way, too, which is interesting.
4480342	4482103	It scrolls the other way.
4482383	4483464	But I think it's neat.
4485265	4488387	Alright, so let's move on with some more news.
4489127	4489667	Slash Pop!
4492269	4493791	Take Two Interactive Employee
4511368	4526340	which is based in California and basically saying he worked overtime didn't get paid for it doesn't really say how he left the firm whether if he was laid off fired or quit but he says that there's a lot of unpaid wages
4527060	4532003	Oh to him and other people in the QA department that he's trying to get together for the class action suit.
4532743	4540188	Also in the state of California, they're very strict on if you work eight hour days, you have to get a 30 minute lunch.
4540988	4542689	Like by law, legally, they have to give you that.
4542729	4545230	And also breaks, 15 minute breaks every couple of hours.
4545270	4549873	He's also saying, he's saying that they basically said too bad, so sad for you.
4549993	4554175	You don't get those lunches and breaks because of crunch time where they had to get a game out the door.
4554836	4554916	Um,
4555376	4568604	So I guess the QA department was ridden really hard, and he's trying to sue them for the fact that they had that department run with no lunches or breaks and had people who weren't salaried, they were hourly employees, not getting paid for their overtime.
4569525	4572046	And he started working there in December of 2006.
4572787	4574688	It doesn't say when he left the firm.
4575248	4581272	And the case, the original complaint was filed in June of 2010, so this is already a little over a year old.
4581972	4597877	but legal things are always so slow they always go at a snail's pace and it looks like it hasn't been thrown out or anything so this may actually go to trial he's trying to scrounge up multiple people to both strengthen his case and also to get the class action thing going
4598277	4603899	I kind of hope it does go to trial because I feel like I've got nothing else to say on this because I'm not in this dude's shoes.
4604379	4608681	And this is one of those cases where I think there's three sides to every story, right?
4609141	4611662	Your side, my side, and the truth, right?
4612123	4616044	And so I kind of want something like this to go to trial just so we can kind of hear.
4616164	4625468	I know we always hear those horror stories in the industry about these claims he's making totally seems legit based on other things we've heard from other companies.
4626371	4641340	When I worked in a call center, when we had, you know, like in a call center, your company has these service level agreements, like you won't be on hold for more than two minutes, all that bull crap.
4641681	4643282	Our wait times were like 40 minutes.
4643322	4645283	So our metrics were a total chit show.
4646043	4648325	And I was working 10 hour days.
4648485	4651407	And basically they said, we're going to put you down for a 30 minute lunch.
4651547	4652988	But if you could only make it 20 minutes,
4654068	4680604	eat fast and you know could you do that because we're really short on call coverage you know that's the kind of shit that they pull in real sweatshop environments like a QA center where you've got all of these testers trying to get a product out the door because it has to go gold in a certain amount of time basically what I'm saying is I've experienced that first hand where I've worked at a job where management was like can you eat at your desk while working also
4681837	4686941	This is such a tricky scenario because you do want to say, you know, yeah, stick it to the man, stick it to the corporation and so forth.
4686981	4687902	And these things should be fair.
4687942	4694767	But then you kind of also look at the other hand and go, well, they'll probably just turn around and outsource this to another country because that's unfortunately where a lot of these jobs are going.
4694787	4697129	And I don't want to get too political and so forth.
4697209	4699711	But, I mean, that's just the world we're in right now.
4700371	4700852	You know what I mean?
4702373	4705535	and we've even heard of QA jobs being outsourced and so forth.
4706576	4716964	At the same time, I don't think that it's right that somebody has to not claim time or not say the accurate time they worked or what have you but
4717845	4720648	I think there needs to be better foresight in the planning of games.
4720808	4725612	And it's, oh, shock and awe, mismanagement in all of these cases, right?
4725972	4729275	Mismanagement, bad staffing planning, bad, you know, what a shocker.
4729295	4739344	Well, yeah, it's because the managers that are managing these employees probably get paid on how early the game is done and they get a bonus based on that.
4739444	4743668	So they want their bonus to be big because it's all about their pocket money.
4744361	4750286	and people fear that if they don't comply, you know, and Salacious Pop, when you were in that situation, what were you going to do?
4750306	4750747	Tell them no?
4752911	4777596	well in my case when I had to work the mandatory overtime I was paid for it but um yeah it's like this is really shitty and I want to walk out of this building for 30 minutes and clear my head um but I can't because they're basically telling me that I don't get a lunch but I got rent to pay I gotta pay bills and I'm not just gonna flip them off and quit your job will end up overseas if you don't do it yeah so and that's like that's that's the real problem
4780237	4781138	Is there an easy answer?
4781238	4781578	I don't know.
4782299	4796570	But I guess the fact that this guy is making such a big complaint, it sounds like this is a pretty widespread, you know, supported by management abuse of an entire department rather than, you know, an ugly week where they had to do sketchy things.
4796630	4804817	It sounds like this was just really, or at least the case that he's trying to present is that they, you know, it was run, the QA department was run very terribly.
4805057	4814193	Based on how long we've been doing this show, or how long you all have been listening, and the stories we read week in and week out about what happens in the gaming world, does this lawsuit surprise anybody?
4816136	4816677	Anyone surprised?
4816997	4817318	Why not?
4819520	4820501	just comes with the industry.
4821282	4821742	Exactly.
4822082	4822963	But does that make it right?
4823523	4823704	No.
4824404	4828608	Well, also, so he's an ex-Take-Two Interactive employee.
4828648	4836995	The division that he was in is now called Visual Concepts, formerly 2K Sports, that had all the Sega sports licenses.
4837655	4845302	So I can imagine in that QA environment, if EA's BS, they're putting out the new Madden or whatever,
4846042	4849124	They need to get their game out in time for what EA is doing.
4850125	4857770	So basically all of the sports games that Take-Two has put out since 2006, those are the games that would have been affected by this QA department.
4858550	4868757	So I could definitely see how if Madden comes out and your game is supposed to come out a week before and you don't make your gold pressing of it, then that's money down the drain.
4868837	4870398	Well, let's see it go to trial.
4870578	4871819	I want to see this case defended.
4874255	4875176	I want to see what happens.
4876658	4886549	For once, can we not settle out of court and let's do it the good old American way and waste taxpayer monies on an actual courtroom trial lawsuit because this is something I would like to see how this plays out.
4887771	4888852	But it'll get settled.
4888872	4889212	They all do.
4892041	4896725	Unless this guy's totally full of crap and he doesn't have the documentation, he gets left out of court.
4896825	4897565	It very well could be.
4898546	4899607	And we just don't know.
4899727	4904791	But I think it says something that we look at this and we go, yeah, not too surprising, right?
4905392	4910016	I mean, so I think we're kind of saying, well, this doesn't sound like it's full of shit.
4910076	4911237	I mean, it could be in this case.
4911297	4912057	We don't know this guy.
4912098	4915280	This guy could just be a bitter Betty, but we don't know.
4916661	4918523	That's why it has to go to trial so we can find out.
4921029	4922730	Anyway, let's move on with more gaming news.
4923571	4923791	Oh yeah.
4924391	4925792	We thought it was going to be a short show tonight.
4925812	4929735	We're already an hour and a half into part A. Anyhow.
4929875	4930435	We'll go quick.
4930716	4931076	You watch.
4932517	4936759	So Sony is talking smack about Microsoft.
4936899	4937380	Are they not?
4939341	4942563	Basically, there is a recent interview concerning Microsoft's publishing policies.
4961655	4975220	Basically, the thing that he was pissed off about was Microsoft's content submission and release policy, which forbids its games from being released first or with exclusive content on other platforms.
4976541	4993972	So for example, titles for Xbox 360 must ship at least simultaneously with other video game platforms and must have at least feature and content parity on disc with other video game platform versions in all regions where the title is available.
4994493	4999796	If these conditions are not met, Microsoft reserves the right to not allow content to be released on the Xbox 360.
5000977	5007120	It's actually interesting for a few reasons because I know for a fact, like, was it Dead Space 2 and stuff?
5007140	5015744	They had, you know, content that was on the Blu-ray version of, you know, for the PS3, and that wasn't on the 360 version.
5015944	5016664	We didn't get that.
5017364	5026308	It was the HD remake of Dead Space, the Wii one that they had, you know, the on-rails shooter one.
5026488	5026808	Oh, yeah.
5026828	5027249	They had that.
5027589	5029370	And then also, I believe...
5030690	5032713	I want to say Battlefield 3 might have something.
5032973	5037318	There's like the original Battlefield 1942 I think was supposed to be on one of the discs.
5037358	5041864	It's a lot of EA games that'll do that where they'll have exclusive thingies.
5042544	5044647	But we don't know if this is really true or not, right?
5046141	5046742	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5066197	5071202	I think what Chris and other representatives of Microsoft are doing is protecting inferior technology.
5071322	5073344	This is according to Rob Dyer again.
5073844	5089138	I think they want to dumb it down and keep it as pedestrian as possible so that if you want to do anything on Blu-ray or if you have extra content above 9 gigs or you want to do anything of that nature, you better sure as heck remember that Microsoft can't handle that.
5091425	5120207	I'm just bickering wow it's almost like the exact same story that Salacious Pop just read except this time it's not the manager it's Microsoft using their pull to strong arm developers to get what they want because they're out there in the marketplace more than Playstation but see here's where I kind of question this whole thing I have a big question mark about this not just the examples you gave but Japan Microsoft can't get away with this in Japan no how could they possibly no
5120862	5121923	and maybe even Europe.
5121963	5129126	I don't know what the sales numbers look like in Europe, but I think America's the only place where the Xbox really dominates the PS3 and that gap is closing.
5129486	5130786	I think it's important to note too.
5131347	5137289	So this might be Microsoft's way to kind of make sure that the Xbox doesn't die, but it's going to have the reverse effect, isn't it?
5137869	5139930	Like I look at this and go, this is just dumb.
5140010	5143432	If this is already in effect, I don't think it's really hurting them any.
5144520	5144880	I don't know.
5145040	5148802	It's just... But if Sony were to do the same thing, who loses?
5148882	5149483	The consumer?
5150043	5152444	Well, that's what... Here's what you just do then.
5152865	5153685	It's pretty simple.
5154125	5155046	And they've already done this.
5156226	5157547	You put out free download content.
5157667	5162230	You put a voucher in the game and you get free download content on PlayStation 3.
5162530	5164011	It falls within all that.
5164091	5164331	No!
5164471	5165091	Here's what you do.
5165211	5167373	You make your game for the PlayStation 3 and fuck the 360.
5167733	5169414	I mean, if that's...
5170194	5170735	Thanks for watching!
5185291	5186072	Thanks for watching!
5202528	5223051	and you can still market it as an exclusive I'm not trying to come off as a Sony fanboy either because I do love a lot of what Microsoft's done with Xbox I mean obviously Xbox Live Arcade is something everybody's trying to copy now Xbox Live, set the bar and so forth granted I liked Microsoft a lot more before my account was hacked for $125 and I haven't been able to play for three weeks but I digress
5223571	5223811	Rage
5251525	5253707	Rage is on one Blu-ray on the PlayStation 3.
5254228	5257330	Rage is on three to four DVDs on the Xbox 360.
5258511	5259052	That sucks.
5259893	5260613	It's not a big deal.
5260813	5261995	I don't give a shit about this.
5262695	5263176	I don't give a shit.
5263196	5265418	Final Fantasy XIII was on several DVDs.
5265618	5266819	Didn't really change the game.
5267299	5268821	Lost Odyssey, yeah.
5269021	5272344	Wasn't it the Atlus game Catherine that came out?
5272644	5277388	There isn't room on a 360 disc for the Japanese...
5278129	5279770	Dialogue with English subtitles.
5280410	5284393	So because they can't fit it on the 360 version, they took it off of the PS3 version.
5284433	5284873	Is that right?
5285574	5287295	Or else the 360 version, what's it going to sell it?
5287315	5288335	I don't think so.
5288355	5292518	Because, I mean, I've seen, you know, ISO rips of that.
5292578	5294339	And Catherine's not that big a gain.
5294379	5297941	It's like, it's four or five gigs.
5297981	5298902	I mean, they've got room.
5299422	5302204	But I just think they just didn't bother much.
5303286	5325740	sometimes they just don't put the extra language track in there I mean a lot of video games don't put the Japanese language tracks in sometimes fighting games and so forth do but you know the speech in that is very short but you know most role-playing games out there don't and I know Catherine's not an RPG but most RPGs don't bother with the second track it's actually kind of really cool when they have it there you know and you can play in either language but very rare right
5326400	5341525	So, anyway, I guess we'll see if this kind of holds out to be... I want to say if it holds out to be true, but I guess we are hearing it is kind of fact, but you have some cases where it's not, so...
5342205	5346608	Yeah, I mean, I don't know when this went to effect, if it's just something that they just now put out.
5347128	5351951	But all I know is, like, I know that there's been titles, and I think there's some that haven't come out yet.
5352772	5355013	Actually, I know another perfect example.
5356795	5358476	For, was it...
5360558	5363359	and of course now the titles have disappeared.
5364500	5370583	Bioshock Infinite is going to have the first Bioshock game on disc for the PlayStation 3 version.
5371103	5374945	Not so much on the 360 because they have the extra space for that.
5376416	5378798	I want to say it was Battlefield 1942.
5378858	5389662	I'm not sure if that was on the PlayStation 3 version of Battlefield 3, but one of these games that was coming out had another game on the disc because they have so much space.
5389862	5395245	Microsoft's got to be a little worried because for the first time,
5396065	5399509	in this whole generation of games where it's been PS3 versus Xbox.
5400009	5405815	We were hearing a lot more favorable things about the PlayStation 3 back in May.
5406335	5409899	It was in May when Portal 2 and Mortal Kombat came out.
5410259	5412461	Most people opted to get those games on the PlayStation 3.
5413182	5420369	And that was really the first time you were hearing that because you had an extra character on the PlayStation 3 version, Kratos, right, of Mortal Kombat.
5420930	5424997	and when it came to Portal 2 you had the whole Steam integration and a free copy on the PC.
5425537	5428543	I mean, which wasn't even remotely close to what the 360 could offer.
5430578	5431598	And again, I'm not trying to dog on 360.
5432098	5437040	360 has proven the better system than PlayStation 3 in some cases.
5437620	5451043	But I think now it's getting to a point where Xbox can't just kind of rest on their laurels of, well, we were the cheaper system for so long that more people have Xboxes in their houses than they do PlayStations because that gap is slowly closing.
5451343	5453624	At the end of the day, it's going to be the games that speak for themselves.
5453684	5457805	It's going to take developers, if these rules are true, standing up to these rules and saying...
5459165	5475848	forget it, we can survive as a Playstation 3 exclusive, it worked for Demon's Souls it worked for, you know whatever other first party Sony games are out there 3D Dot Game Heroes and so forth so Kaijudo in chat says L.A.
5476148	5488751	Noire wouldn't have so much DLC if they ran it on Playstation 3 only yeah, maybe sometimes the DLC is part of the whole plan we're gonna get you to pay 60 bucks and then another 20 pay to unlock exactly, pay to unlock content
5489335	5491497	All right, quickly, let's talk about a Wii game.
5491697	5493179	That's right, a new Wii game.
5493619	5495441	More information coming out on it tonight.
5495801	5503068	Square Enix is going to be revealing more information about Dragon Quest on Ustream at 2 p.m.
5503108	5504710	Japan time, September 5th.
5505070	5506992	That's 10 o'clock Pacific tonight.
5507212	5509735	So in about two hours, they'll be starting that event.
5509775	5510055	Who knows?
5510075	5511717	We might still be live at this pace tonight.
5513058	5525763	but they're probably going to be showing more information on Dragon Quest X although it could be a new announcement they announced a long time ago some of you forgot Dragon Quest X is going to be coming on the Wii they said that back in 2008 but they have yet to show off anything about the game
5526661	5538269	It's going to be interesting to see if they stick to their guns and they put this game out on the Wii relatively late in the Wii's life cycle because they would have to announce this and really have a date ready to go relatively soon.
5539931	5543413	I worry it's going to suffer a little bit from what Dragon Quest VIII suffered from.
5543533	5545354	VIII was on the PS2, right?
5545374	5545955	Towards the end.
5546095	5550058	VIII was on the PS2 at the very, very end and it's the same thing that hurt Final Fantasy XII.
5550598	5564343	both those games came out I don't think very far apart from each other and both those games you know for the hardcore gamer got overlooked a little bit because everybody was putting 360s and Wii's in their homes and so forth or excuse me just 360s and other new stuff 7 was PS1 right?
5564443	5569205	so they've been really like those games don't haven't really come out as often as they used to
5569585	5575230	No, and the Dragon Quest IX was on the DS, obviously, and now X was announced some time ago on the Wii.
5575650	5580354	Because for a while there, especially back in 2008, it seemed like the Wii was everything.
5581174	5585758	It's going to be interesting to see if they've stuck to that, or if maybe one of the announcements we're getting today is...
5586531	5587812	and it might show up on other systems.
5588552	5589873	I kind of don't think they'll do that.
5590514	5593856	Keep in mind, Dragon Quest is still a very Japanese-centric game.
5594316	5603421	Dragon Quest IX, everyone went clown shit for that game in Japan and over here, people that know what Dragon Quest is bought it, but it wasn't the phenomenon that it was over there.
5603702	5606863	I bet your ass it's not coming out on Xbox.
5607744	5609105	Period.
5609145	5612247	It's a Japanese game and Xbox is not what it is here.
5613688	5614368	PlayStation 3?
5614448	5614508	Ah!
5616469	5643496	I just don't think so I don't think they have a need to maybe Dragon Quest XI probably not Dragon Quest X well I mean different studio obviously but the 360 did have Blue Dragon which was by Mistwalker Studio and also the artwork was Akira Toriyama who did Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Quest so there's that connection there it wouldn't be unheard of if it came out on the 360 because we've had a game that looks like it already true true
5644276	5645438	All right, so we'll see what happens.
5646459	5650203	By the time most of you are hearing this on the podcast, actually, we'll have more information on that.
5650243	5651965	So be looking for that on Labor Day.
5652306	5657471	By the way, just real quick, there is going to be a Dragon Quest X trailer in the Wii Anniversary Collection.
5657552	5660295	I mean, this just really strengthens that, yes, they're committed to the Wii.
5661115	5687536	I don't know if you've heard but they are bundling I think it's 1, 2, 3 and the Super Nintendo remakes of 1 and 2 are all going to be on a Wii Anniversary disc it's very it's like that Mario collection they did it's like that for Dragon Quest which is cool but it won't be out in the US to be fair though it's still more content that was on that fucking Mario disc hey at least you know what they put more than one game on there guess what Nintendo you could have done that those discs
5687856	5690537	They can hold more than a Super NES ROM.
5690657	5692017	Well, it's just 1, 2, and 3.
5692657	5694017	I would have loved to see that rip.
5694577	5694918	1 meg!
5695638	5698478	It's like, okay.
5699218	5700079	Waste of a disc.
5701239	5703959	I wish that anniversary collection would come out in the US, actually.
5704040	5705900	I really love the first Dragon Quest game.
5706200	5707180	Dragon Warrior.
5708020	5708300	Remember?
5708320	5708360	So...
5711181	5711781	Alright, anyhow.
5712782	5716344	That is coming out by the time most of you guys hear this, so look for it.
5716444	5716944	Salacious Pop.
5718425	5727971	A couple weeks ago we reported on a story about the Video Game History Museum project and how they were trying to get the money they needed to get the thing off the ground.
5728911	5745301	The Video Game History Museum is, I think it sounds like it's just three or four dudes that are running this and they usually have an exhibit at the Classic Gaming Expo in Las Vegas where they would have floor space for their video game history pieces and all the information there.
5745942	5749444	And they really wanted to give this thing a
5749964	5750765	Thanks for watching!
5765693	5791999	uh Eidos and so that's that's where it's going to be and their Kickstarter was a success and the story is that they are $20,000 over what they initially wanted um I got the oh I had the Kickstarter page open but I closed it uh but it's like I think they had 700 donors and the target goal was $30,000 on their Kickstarter page and now they're at 50 something so yeah um
5794111	5814889	no real update yet as to you know whether like what what the building's gonna look like or if they actually have a space for it like bought if they're gonna buy the plot to build it on but yeah they made their money so hopefully within maybe a couple years we'll have a permanent video game hall of fame slash history museum in California for us to go to
5817208	5821391	Well, I remember kind of reporting on this a couple weeks ago, and it sounded kind of cool at the time.
5821991	5825313	So I'm glad they kind of got their kinks worked out and what have you.
5826514	5827755	So what do you say, road trip?
5829076	5831938	Actually, I've seen their exhibit at Classic Gaming Expo before, and it's pretty cool.
5832278	5835500	So I think it's neat that they're kind of going to have a place for this.
5836301	5843288	If you go to their Kickstarter page, which I can find and post into chat, there are certain landmarks.
5843768	5850935	If you donate $10, $20, $50 and so on, there are perks that you get once the museum is a reality.
5851256	5858483	Like a ticket to admission or something like VIP ticket to get in first before everyone else or whatever.
5858803	5859123	Creative.
5860204	5861805	Most Kickstarter pages are like that.
5862145	5862545	Right, right.
5863685	5864005	All right.
5864565	5869667	Well, let's go around the world and check out some release dates and see what is coming out in a country near you.
5870367	5871887	Hello and welcome to the fourth quarter.
5871927	5873208	We have lots of stuff for you.
5874788	5877929	Yeah, I know it's not technically the fourth quarter of the year, but you know what?
5878229	5879689	No one really counts December.
5879929	5881810	It's on after Labor Day.
5881890	5882670	It is on.
5882890	5886071	That's when Michaels is going to start rolling out the Christmas decorations.
5887351	5889192	That's when, you know, it's on.
5889392	5892353	And as far as the game industry cares, it is the fourth quarter.
5892594	5894555	So let's start off.
5894635	5896475	Get Fit with Mel B coming out on the Wii.
5896535	5898436	It's a game that's been delayed for God knows how long.
5898456	5900057	Come on, I thought you said it was the fourth quarter.
5900717	5902358	Well, there's crap in the fourth quarter.
5903819	5905940	Dead Island coming out on... Mel B just had another baby.
5905980	5907241	She's going to need to play her own game.
5908541	5911002	Dead Island is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
5912683	5913784	and PC this week.
5915225	5922669	Challenge Me Word Puzzles on the DS, Junior Mystery Stories on the DS, Penguins in Madagascar, Dr. Blowhole Returns again.
5923149	5928072	That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and the DS.
5928632	5931634	Resistance 3 on the PlayStation 3 this week.
5932014	5933975	Driver Renegade on the 3DS.
5935877	5939521	Driver San Francisco on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii this week.
5939601	5940382	No PC yet.
5940482	5941864	PC got delayed to the end of the month.
5942244	5944968	I really want to see how fast their DRM gets cracked.
5946970	5952917	They're doing an Uncharted dual pack on the PlayStation 3, the first and second game, with some download content thrown in for $39.99.
5952997	5953538	That's kind of cool.
5955760	5959042	Rise of the Nightmares, the first M-rated Kinect game.
5959183	5962065	It's by the guys that did the House of the Dead series.
5962785	5964567	And that's on Xbox 360.
5965367	5968530	Disgaea 4, A Promise Unforgotten on PlayStation 3.
5968670	5972913	And let's see here, Junior Island Adventure.
5973113	5974394	Slash Pop, did you know that was coming out?
5974414	5975595	Are you a Disgaea fan?
5976516	5978217	Yeah, I don't have 3 yet, so I'm behind.
5978538	5979859	But I have 1 and 2 on PSP.
5980019	5980099	Ah.
5980878	5990284	Tiger Woods on PC Warhammer 40k Space Marine on PS3, Xbox 360, PC Flame Red Nintendo 3DS Star Fox 64 3D It's definitely looking busier this week than it was last week.
6006690	6009393	Alright, moving over to Japan and looking at the Japanese releases.
6009533	6014259	On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week on the 8th of September, Biohazard Revival Selection.
6014339	6016582	Of course, Biohazard is their name for Resident Evil.
6017002	6020907	Get this, it's Code Veronica and Resident Evil 4 on one disc for the 360.
6022008	6022729	It's pretty cool, huh?
6022749	6027412	I believe PS3 has a version of that as well, so that's pretty neat, especially if you kind of missed out on those games.
6027812	6033536	Also in Japan this week, Daysex, Human Revolution on 360, Rise of Nightmares as well.
6033576	6036118	That's a Sega game coming out in Japan this week on the 360.
6037739	6041741	Not sure if this is a port of something we have over here.
6041761	6048146	I'm trying to look at the screenshots real quick, but it's definitely a survival horror game with scary-ass clown-looking people and all that.
6049987	6051208	Does that art look familiar to anyone?
6052345	6053447	That's something that's here.
6053527	6054408	Oh, it's a Kinect game.
6054528	6055329	That's Rise of the Nightmare.
6055990	6056390	Oh, I didn't know.
6056751	6057752	That's something that's out here, really?
6057912	6058853	Yeah, it's coming out next week.
6059594	6061757	I told you, the first mature rated Kinect game.
6062277	6062397	Oh.
6063098	6063759	It's very bloody.
6063859	6064740	It's got evil clowns.
6065281	6065742	Yes, it does.
6066222	6068425	Alright, well, Japan gets that game as well.
6070847	6071648	So that's on the 360.
6072128	6075029	Then going to the PlayStation 3 and seeing what's coming out there.
6075489	6077550	We have Disgaea 4 makes its way.
6078631	6079011	I'm sorry.
6079071	6079871	That's a U.S.
6079911	6080932	state sneaking its way in there.
6081532	6085254	Biohazard Revival Selection also comes out on the PlayStation 3 on September 8th.
6085674	6087755	Deus Ex Human Revolution there as well.
6088155	6092777	Minano Golf 5 gets a move version that comes out this week.
6092797	6093197	That's what?
6093237	6094218	Hot Shots Golf, right?
6094418	6094558	Yeah.
6094818	6096719	And it gets a price reduction overall.
6097139	6100681	There is a new console which comes with Tales of Zillia.
6101121	6102382	Comes out from Namco Bandai.
6102422	6104563	This is the newest game in their Tales of series.
6105183	6107544	It is written and designed specifically for the PlayStation 3.
6107584	6111186	They're doing a console bundle to support that in Japan.
6111386	6112106	So pretty big week.
6112947	6118970	Resistance 3 also finally getting its release in Japan this week.
6119030	6121731	Moving on to some of the handhelds.
6124661	6144775	um trying to look at the PSP dates here Ace Combat X2 gets a price reduction this week otherwise nothing really big on the PSP this week uh trying to look really quickly at the Wii Super Sentai Battle Ranger Cross from Namco Bandai and lastly on the 3DS there's really nothing until the 22nd
6148921	6149241	All right.
6149681	6150762	How about the UK, Alan?
6151603	6154184	In the UK, we have Resistance 3 on the PS3.
6155105	6159247	We have Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 The Masters on Mac and PC.
6160108	6162730	Blood Rain Betrayal on the PS3.
6163550	6164791	Crimson Alliance on the 360.
6164831	6170054	A game by Konami called Leadmes, if I'm saying that right.
6170294	6171895	L-E-D-M-E-E-S for the 360.
6172196	6174257	I clicked on the link for it, and they don't have...
6174957	6177919	It's an Xbox Live Arcade game.
6178499	6181821	No content on the page I was looking at other than that the publisher is Konami.
6181881	6184122	It's also a Kinect game.
6185423	6189044	Dead Island on PC, PlayStation 3, and the 360.
6189225	6194167	El Shaddai Ascension of the Metatron on the PS3 and the 360.
6196108	6202111	Rise of Nightmares, the game we were just talking about on the Kinect, also arriving in the UK on the 9th for the 360.
6202151	6202451	That's it.
6204190	6206451	Actdeft says the American version of the game is 13.31 megabytes.
6230823	6237368	Great waste of over 4,000 megabytes on a goddamn DVD.
6238189	6238589	Seriously.
6238689	6239530	Dual layer.
6239550	6242733	Don't forget some games like Mario Galaxy and Xenoblade are dual layer.
6242813	6245415	They should have put on a dual layer just to be extravagant.
6245695	6266803	that disc right there has so little on it you can literally put your fingers and rub it all over the disc and it would be just fine you know what you could do is if you were into the backup quote unquote you know what I'm saying you could do a GameCube sized disc and put the ROM on that and load it off a GameCube disc but with the Wii Note it was a Wii disc
6268504	6269064	I don't know.
6269525	6271486	It's just that's pathetic is what it is.
6271686	6273007	They really should just release that.
6273027	6273627	You're mad.
6273807	6274508	Why are you mad though?
6275308	6277109	And then lastly, let's see.
6277610	6280912	Cyber Beast is talking about I really need the Nyko or Nyko Zoom.
6281572	6282773	That's the whole thing on the Kinect.
6282813	6283613	Yeah, I got delayed.
6283673	6284654	It's supposed to be coming.
6284874	6288997	Well, it would have been out already if it was coming out in time, but it's September now.
6289717	6291338	Well, and Japan's getting it.
6292078	6293759	And I want one too.
6295059	6296820	I think so many people are interested in that.
6297080	6300182	And by the way, if you haven't heard of that, that's the thing that you can actually put on your Kinect.
6300662	6303743	And it will help a smaller room be more effective with the Wii.
6303883	6306804	It's basically like a wide-angle lens, basically, for your Kinect.
6306844	6307265	The Kinect.
6308065	6309145	And it's a great idea.
6309266	6315548	And I wonder if Microsoft isn't going to just kind of change the Kinect because it seems like this is so badly needed, you know?
6316609	6317089	So we'll see.
6317749	6320211	Alright, anyhow, let's move on with a couple more quick stories for you guys.
6320471	6320712	Loki.
6321952	6330259	Avalanche, the developers behind the Just Cause series, they have some comments regarding DRM.
6330279	6333121	They believe it's a threat to the entertaining experience.
6335222	6338565	Basically, what was it, uh...
6340486	6343367	Christopher Sundberg said,
6357714	6378702	I don't like always on DRM solutions at all since they offer nothing to the consumer if you continuously give something extra for registering and being online and award them for actually paying for and playing your game it'd be different but always on DRM says thank you for buying our game we trust you as far as we can throw you
6379798	6380839	And yeah, that kind of makes sense.
6381300	6383442	And I love how Ubisoft likes to spin it.
6400820	6403923	No, you would have had multiplayer in there anyways, but you're being a dick.
6404323	6405024	That's what it is.
6405804	6410007	You just don't want people, you know, to be on your online service if they didn't buy the game new.
6412570	6412870	Whatever.
6412990	6414311	I just, it's stupid.
6415666	6423856	Well, isn't it true that when all this DRM stuff, the person that loses is the people that are buying these games legitimately?
6423977	6432087	Exactly, and I'm very curious, and I will definitely be reporting on that, how quickly the DRM gets cracked on Driver.
6432547	6434470	It will be fast, I guarantee it.
6436303	6436623	All right.
6436984	6454116	Well, before we get to the classic game of the week tonight, we have a new segment here on Orange Lounge Radio because, you know, we just see too many news stories that are like this, and so we just need to give it its own segment on the show, and it's called Local News Making Gamers Look Bad.
6454136	6457378	Local News Making Gamers Look Bad
6461775	6462655	That's right.
6462835	6466617	Local news making gamers look bad.
6466877	6475320	And for tonight's local news making gamers look bad, we're going to go to the station WSB TV Channel 2.
6476861	6477921	And where are they located?
6477941	6480222	They're in Georgia, but I don't think they're in Atlanta station.
6480242	6481543	I think they're like northern Georgia.
6482063	6493010	We're going to get to a story that they ran this week that captured some of the gaming blogs about pornographic drawings that were found inside a used Wii game.
6493050	6493911	And I know what you're thinking.
6494431	6496773	This isn't really a news story.
6497413	6498474	This makes it on the news?
6498914	6500936	No, this is the whole point of this segment.
6501336	6504178	It's local news making gamers look bad.
6504278	6507760	So yes, it does have to do with gaming because it's your local news station.
6507800	6508901	Oh, it is an Atlanta station.
6508941	6509041	It's
6509281	6510701	Action News 2 in Atlanta.
6511022	6513362	Oh, if Bobby had had a show tonight, he would have been all over this.
6513402	6514282	This is in his backyard.
6514603	6516243	This is in, by the way, the town.
6516663	6518163	And remember this in the back of your mind.
6518584	6519944	Cumming, Georgia.
6520044	6521985	And that's C-U-M-M-I-N-G.
6522065	6523265	Like, I'm cumming, right?
6523905	6525746	That's exactly where this story takes place.
6526486	6527046	So here we go.
6527106	6530747	Portographic drawings from Action News 2 in Atlanta.
6532219	6536763	and a six-year-old boy found pornographic drawings inside the box of a Nintendo Wii game.
6537123	6539285	The packaging says it's suitable for everyone.
6539665	6545450	Channel 8's Napier Viteri is live tonight in Forsyth County with the discovery parents were not prepared to explain.
6545650	6545871	Amy?
6546311	6549193	And I apologize for the audio is very, very low on this.
6549233	6551035	I might have to fix it in post-production a little bit.
6551075	6558201	But again, the local internet news is very not good at equalizing their audio.
6558261	6559182	So, sorry.
6561038	6565259	Jovita, Tracy Turner bought her six-year-old son this game at a local GameStop.
6565299	6568441	It says on the outside of the box, rated E for everyone.
6568741	6571822	But what he found inside is for mature adults only.
6572782	6573582	Let's find this one.
6573802	6584146	Tracy Turner has a stack of kid-friendly video games for six-year-old JT and four-year-old Madison.
6584326	6585046	The kids are cute.
6585066	6586447	I'm not going to talk bad about the kids.
6586847	6589588	It's cute that they do have these Wii games that they play.
6593268	6595729	By the way, the game they're showing, I don't know why they don't name it.
6595869	6600371	This is kind of like when the local news here did the story on us and then never named our station.
6600391	6600831	Remember that?
6601072	6604553	They were doing the story on podcasting and they interviewed us, but they never said it was Orange Launch Radio.
6604593	6608355	They just said, these are three local guys that do podcasts about video games.
6608635	6609155	Never named it.
6609495	6612657	The game that they're looking at here is Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games.
6614139	6617361	My favorite part is that they show, and I realize it's a radio show, but they're showing...
6635695	6638677	Parts of the picture are cropped, but they're very cropped.
6638717	6643820	So it just looks like these happy little faces and somebody does have some artistic talent here.
6643941	6650625	It looks like someone just drew stick figures with a giant dong or something on it with a Sharpie marker.
6650705	6651686	Exactly, exactly.
6651866	6656189	Not prepared to answer the questions of what was going on in the picture, so...
6657009	6660915	Turner tells me she called GameStop to let them know what was included in their merchandise.
6661035	6663398	She says an employee thanked her for calling and hung up.
6663839	6667024	She even called the corporate office but tells me she got the same response.
6673172	6674514	That's bonus content, okay?
6674534	6676736	You should be thanking us.
6677177	6682222	Oh, well, didn't you know GameStop has the exclusive with Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games?
6682502	6685465	You get free wiener picks with every purchase.
6685485	6688188	Do you know how much sex goes on at the Olympics in real life?
6688268	6691672	I'll have you know that we should charge you extra for those wiener picks.
6693587	6695548	Wow, this is investigative journalism.
6695568	6698430	And I love this shot of the reporter walking in the GameStop.
6698470	6702233	Like, I'm going to go march on in there and get to the bottom of what happened here.
6713681	6715663	to the same employee who took Turner's call.
6715843	6720407	She says no one apologized, that you just said thanks for letting us know and then hung up.
6722889	6726291	I also called the corporate office and someone told me they would get back to me.
6727052	6735199	These compelling shots of the reporter on her iPhone, like I'm calling them right now and I'm looking very intently at the phone.
6735259	6736640	I just wanted them to say I'm sorry.
6738925	6745068	I got an email from GameStop's corporate office this evening asking me for Turner's information so they can look into what happened further.
6745428	6751271	As for Turner, she tells me from now on she's going to buy new games, spend a few more dollars so she can avoid this happening again.
6751711	6752772	We're live in Forsyth County.
6752932	6755273	Amy Napier-Viteri, Channel 2 Action News, Nightbeat.
6755413	6755713	That's it.
6755753	6756514	It's propaganda.
6756754	6759856	Propaganda from the developers and the publishers of these games.
6760316	6764858	They're just trying to get people to think, you know what, if I buy used, I'm going to get fucking dick pics in my games.
6765318	6765979	Buy new.
6766119	6767399	No dick pics in new games.
6767659	6768200	Here's the thing.
6769740	6773701	I'm not making fun of the mother because she has a legitimate complaint.
6774081	6774281	Yes.
6775322	6775942	She really does.
6776162	6780843	I mean, the fact that it's on the fucking news in Atlanta is a little weird to me.
6781023	6782423	Like, okay.
6783043	6784284	But let's be real.
6785484	6787885	It's probably one of those things where she went to GameStop.
6788085	6789125	She got kind of like...
6789585	6790565	Well, thanks!
6807430	6818715	They do help out, like, you know, in cases of... This isn't one of those cases that really need... It's like, yeah, that's unfortunate, but... But this is just a seized opportunity, I mean, for the local news station.
6818775	6820995	This is really... Okay, look, look.
6821776	6822456	What did she want?
6822656	6826057	She wanted GameStop to fucking say, sorry about that, man.
6826097	6829599	Like, any of us in the GameStop employees' shoes, you know what to say.
6830239	6831659	I'm really sorry to hear about that, ma'am.
6832159	6837500	If you wouldn't mind bringing the game back to the store, we'll get you a full refund or we'll get you a replacement copy.
6837540	6838540	Dan, you're shaking your head.
6839161	6839761	You disagree.
6840061	6842061	Get Dan a mic.
6842661	6844942	You disagree that the woman... We would have just laughed at her.
6847182	6849882	We would have been like, you got a game with drawings in it.
6850002	6850762	You're stupid.
6850903	6853283	You know damn well that's not what you would have done.
6853623	6855123	I would have actually copped to drawing him.
6857944	6859584	Would you have done it in a humorous way, though?
6860439	6861259	No, I don't know.
6861279	6864960	I would have had her... If she was mad, I would have just told her to bring the game back.
6865000	6865540	Exactly.
6865600	6866080	Thank you, Dan.
6866120	6869561	You bring the game back and we'll replace the game or give your money back.
6869581	6870901	Oh, no, I wouldn't have replaced the game.
6871421	6873782	I just would have wanted to see what was done on the inside of the cover.
6874042	6874722	Come on.
6874762	6875282	Yes, you would.
6875302	6877863	You'd replace the game and or give her money back.
6877923	6879043	I'd give her a different manual.
6880463	6882264	It's a used game anyway.
6882364	6885244	Like, fucking GameStop makes hella money on those games.
6885264	6886644	You could have afforded to give them one way or the other.
6886664	6887285	That's added value.
6887305	6889185	That's like a Deus Ex coupon, but better.
6891041	6892322	Alright, you're not helping, Dan.
6892602	6893563	No, I never help.
6894404	6903472	Alright, but to be honest, and now it's on the local news because she didn't get that apology or that reaction that any one of us with a shred of customer service in us knows that she should have had.
6904453	6905314	Just an apology.
6905874	6915283	So it sounds like the GameStop employee that obviously looked at the back of the disc to make sure it was scratched when they took the trade in failed to notice the...
6916844	6922049	PP Drawings on the inside cover that the previous owner drew in there when he wanted to get his five bucks used credit.
6922190	6924192	Which, you know, okay, wake up call.
6924532	6926754	Maybe GameStop needs to be thumbing through those pages.
6926814	6931059	I mean, I wouldn't have thought to, oh, I better look through the manual to make sure no one drew a dick in here.
6931759	6932120	You know?
6933055	6936257	And to be fair, the person who probably drew it probably forgot it was in there.
6936737	6948824	Like, if you do something stupid before, usually before you sell a game back, like, remember back when it was cartridges, and like, if you name your character cunt, like, you're gonna erase, you're gonna have the courtesy probably to erase that file before you sell it.
6949024	6950045	Alright, some of you won't.
6950745	6954087	Yeah, you get a game from Blockbuster, and it's like boobs, butts, turd.
6954807	6957949	It's like Oregon Trail, but you just name your Final Fantasy 6 characters after it.
6958349	6959690	And I'm sorry, you know, they're like,
6961505	6962446	How old is 6 and 4?
6963527	6964769	Maybe they wouldn't know what's really going on.
6964989	6967151	But I would have been like, that's funny.
6968653	6972136	But here's my point, guys, is that this really isn't a big issue.
6972196	6973838	The woman has a legitimate complaint.
6974739	6979524	A manager needs to spank an associate at the front line of GameStop here and this could be done, Dan.
6981006	6982487	But it doesn't need to be on the fucking news.
6982607	6983989	Gamers are dirty-ass people, though.
6985063	7005400	and that's what this new story is conveying gamers are all sex crazed maniacs who draw peepees in Mario and Sonic Mario's got a peepee it gets way better than that I can't even tell you the amount of times I was pulling in a system for trade and I popped open the disc drawer and there was porn in it it was a lot
7006351	7008833	and not like, you know, fake porn either.
7009213	7013396	Like real fucking hardcore porn and you're just like, really pal?
7013796	7017759	You couldn't have like opened it up and pulled your, you know, your disc out and put it away.
7017779	7020481	How many did that just to get a reaction out of you though?
7020601	7023123	No, no, it was like people, they were always like, holy fuck.
7024224	7027926	I can't believe, oh my god, you know, you'd give them the disc, you'd wipe off their hands.
7029928	7034251	I swear to god I opened a disc once, a CD case, and there was a cock ring inside.
7036380	7037462	I'm not even fucking with you.
7038964	7042649	And you can tell because it's got that funky latex-y condom smell sort of thing going on.
7042669	7044391	People are like, oh my god!
7044491	7046254	Close the disc, hand it back, say that's yours.
7049887	7075532	Drugs, there have been joints and shit in cases Gamers are dirty ass people So someone graffitiing inside their game cases and forgetting about it That's nothing PSP memory cards were awesome If you ever audited them, the ones that we took on trade I bet you that like 50% of them had porn on them We sold one to a kid once, his mom came back, she was so mad at us She's like, don't you check this?
7075592	7079373	It's like, no Take it home, format it
7081077	7103417	if your 14 year old decided he was going to look around on it and keep it on his PSP that's because he's a 14 year old who's like porn exactly so you're saying what I'm hearing out of you Dan is that it could have been a lot fucking worse and this really is nothing gamers are skeevy fucking terrible people you guys all know you are
7104211	7104631	All right.
7104651	7106092	We got a new name for the segment here.
7106252	7110595	It's Orange Lounge Radio featuring Dan making gamers look bad.
7112977	7122263	I had a friend confide in me that he had to call Netflix because he wanted to send back his copy of There Will Be Blood or Kill Bill 2.
7123003	7123864	And he just...
7124324	7146288	he accidentally put there will be cock yeah it no case it was like it was like it was like boner bros 12 return of the skater teens or whatever and he's like i netflix hello there's a movie on the way to you and their little return cardboard and i i have the movie here i sent you the wrong thing and they're like oh this happens all the time we'll send it back
7146530	7148112	How do you make that mistake?
7159409	7164235	As far as porn names go, it was not a tasteful one.
7164255	7164996	I'll put it that way.
7165056	7167800	No, no, I'm not the porn, like the actual Netflix movie.
7167940	7172906	There's a big difference between sense and sensibility and sniffing balls.
7173767	7178113	There's a big difference between what those DVDs probably look like, you know?
7178590	7192619	Yeah, and he was worried that the disc, whatever, at Netflix, Netflix is all automated, so it would have sent that onto the next person in their queue, and they would have ended up on the local news.
7193000	7196822	So he did his due diligence and called and said, there's porn on the way to you.
7197423	7199264	But yeah, this stuff happens all the time.
7199684	7200265	Doesn't surprise me.
7201105	7225183	and I imagine the person who bought the Sonic game at full retail you know was up late at night and like this game is terrible so he took the instruction booklet and he's like here's what I think of this game and he just threw a big dick this game is cock and then he put it away that's probably what happened fantastic sigh we need to go back to a time when gaming was much simpler and easier music
7227301	7230463	Back before people were drawing penises in the instruction manual.
7230603	7231103	Ah, just kidding.
7231123	7233625	People have always been drawing penises in the instruction manuals, right?
7234285	7235506	It's the classic game of the week.
7235626	7241369	Every week here on the program, DarkSakura takes a trip into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks you all should be playing this week.
7241929	7243630	But she's not here, so not this week.
7244511	7251295	So this week, SalaciousPop is going to take a trip into DarkSakura's gaming vault and pull out a game that he thinks you all should be playing this week.
7251775	7254878	Salacious Pop, what is the classic game of the week?
7254918	7258902	Well, I'm finally giving up the whole Sierra Online classic PC thing.
7259102	7261645	I've sort of written that into the ground.
7262105	7265849	So I'm taking it to Lagoon on the Super Nintendo.
7266469	7268211	All right, let's hear some music from Lagoon.
7268391	7268892	Lagoon.
7271095	7279864	So, Lagoon got its notoriety because it was an RPG that came out near the beginning of the console's life.
7280384	7288793	Obviously, those of us that remember when the Super Nintendo launched, there was Final Fantasy 2, or 4, that was a launch title.
7289353	7294618	The really big heavy-hitter RPGs like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 3, didn't come until much later.
7295299	7296820	in the SNES's life cycle.
7296840	7300684	Final Fantasy II wasn't technically a launch title, but it would be that launch window.
7301044	7302005	It was the Christmas.
7302025	7304307	That turn that Nintendo loves, launch window.
7304808	7313435	So Lagoon came out within a year or a year and a half when there wasn't really much in the way of RPGs to play after you've beaten Final Fantasy.
7314236	7319721	Lagoon was a top-down, sort of think like Zelda-styled game.
7321122	7321442	It was...
7322503	7325485	A pretty unabashed Wanderers of Ys clone.
7326186	7335033	Before there was a Zelda game on the Super Nintendo, it's important to say, because Link to the Past didn't come out until the next Christmas or the Christmas after.
7335273	7341378	And the Ys games, which I think came out on the TurboGrafx-16, wasn't a system that most people owned, really.
7342219	7349865	So Lagoon is pretty much a clone, sort of like Secret of Mana, that style of action RPG, but
7352189	7352911	I played this game.
7352952	7353815	I didn't actually beat it.
7353855	7357850	I borrowed it from a friend and I played it for about a week and had to give it up, give it back.
7358482	7368067	But yeah, the plot is that you live in Lakeland, which is a very lush, beautiful world of water and everything.
7368127	7376371	And this evil wizard has been poisoning the water by the underground castle of Lagoon, which is where all of the magical water comes from.
7376431	7380393	He poisoned it because he wants to raise a big bad demon.
7380793	7383034	Very cookie cutter JRPG plotline.
7383354	7384055	Thank you for watching!
7404204	7425514	so yeah so the water's been poisoned the evil wizard has taken the castle of lagoon out of from the bottom of the sea and he's made it float up into the sky and you have to go eventually go from village to village and level up and beat dungeons and get treasure and eventually you go up to the final dungeon the castle and um the opening uh sort of has a sort of anime
7426534	7430096	Intro, or as much as you could do on the Super Nintendo.
7430136	7439982	And for those of us that are familiar with Ys, the art style, they have the big anime bright eyes that was in Wanderers of Ys, so that's kind of how the art direction was.
7441343	7446426	Just a competent RPG, not really groundbreaking.
7446446	7449047	It was kind of buggy.
7449107	7453170	The boss battles were actually pretty hard if you didn't know how to avoid the little bullets.
7453610	7459399	This game also came out on the Sharp X68000, a Sharp PC home computer product that was released only in Japan.
7467199	7467579	DarkSakura.com
7490019	7492800	I believe they also did the Drakken games.
7492960	7493960	Drakken and Dragonsville.
7494120	7505142	Yeah, and that was also another Super NES RPG where it was kind of... If you were an RPG freak like me, your options were limited.
7505522	7506242	I had Drakken.
7506262	7507402	My parents bought me Drakken.
7507442	7511603	When I got a Super Nintendo for that Christmas, I got Super Mario World, because it comes with it, and Drakken.
7511863	7514403	Because that was the game that the Sears person told me to buy.
7514663	7517264	Or Montgomery Ward, or wherever they bought my Super Nintendo.
7517884	7518084	So...
7518550	7520413	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
7533892	7550918	One additional audio clip that I wanted to have you play is when you kill the boss, you know, you just hack it out and it dies, it had this sort of shriek that played when you killed the boss, and every boss, whether it was a robot or a dinosaur, made the same noise.
7551319	7554580	Let's play it and see if we can recognize what wave file this is.
7554600	7557021	Okay, so here goes the boss.
7557041	7558881	Do you always skip ahead a little bit to the actual death here?
7559882	7559962	Uh...
7561465	7563150	Yeah, here we go.
7563953	7567384	He's exploiting this first boss by finding a spot in the back of the room.
7567404	7567685	Here we go.
7573795	7574235	SoundClipFiles.com
7596348	7619809	so like usually there's little samples of like yeah boy or things like that that you hear like in a DDR song that then you'll hear later in a game somewhere else and it's really weird like um I want to say one of the big DDR songs you hear the samples somewhere else it's really weird max 300 the fire that whole thing like those those clips you hear those elsewhere so anyway
7620129	7628574	Yeah, so I just thought it was funny that I didn't put this together at the time, but yeah, the boss noise when you kill a boss is the elephant cry in the wholesome stage, Street Fighter 2.
7629014	7629214	Nice.
7629455	7636919	But the dungeons in this, you know, had some pretty clever map design, more clever than it probably had any right to.
7637059	7638320	You know, you could get lost.
7639220	7641462	But it was a pretty fast-paced game.
7642242	7643463	You didn't really have to grind too much.
7643543	7647025	You just hit from town to dungeon, and there was always something to do.
7648286	7648586	All right.
7648826	7649587	DarkSakura.com
7673806	7675826	Alright, we're going to take a quick break here, though, guys.
7676266	7678287	Gosh, I thought it was going to be a short night.
7678587	7680727	Part A has been two hours and eight minutes.
7680747	7683108	That's like the longest Part A I think I've seen in a long time.
7683628	7685288	So, good thing it's a three-day weekend, huh?
7685308	7691849	We've got plenty more show to come, including your calls, some news about Resistance, Persona 4, a Super Mario Bros.
7691909	7693129	and Portal crossover game.
7693149	7694089	That's going to be very interesting.
7694370	7702811	And your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR, as well as your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
7708883	7711624	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
7711684	7720628	We are live here on this Sunday evening, September the 4th of 2011, Labor Day weekend, with the 426th episode of our program.
7722069	7723690	We're running a little long tonight.
7723750	7725451	Part A was about two hours.
7725551	7727552	I don't think Part B will be quite as long.
7728152	7731693	And we had a late start live tonight, too, which I know doesn't affect the podcasties.
7731734	7733734	But good thing it's a three-day weekend.
7733754	7734555	Let's just put it that way.
7735355	7736836	We don't have to get up early for work tomorrow.
7737396	7737936	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7755607	7761150	I always kind of thought, like, I don't want to say it's weird to, like, watch playthroughs because I get the allure of that.
7761210	7763832	You know, like, who doesn't like to sit and watch someone else play a video game?
7763872	7768334	And the Internet's made that very interesting where you can kind of do all that through YouTube and so forth.
7768374	7769235	But I don't know.
7769255	7772036	I like to kind of get my hands on and play and all that stuff.
7772156	7775058	And so I kind of want to do a playthrough of Super Metroid or something retro.
7775178	7780060	I'd love to record a Let's Play and put it on YouTube, but I do not have the attention span.
7780541	7781841	You don't have the attention span to do that?
7782141	7783262	Unless it was a short game.
7783282	7784823	30 hours of, yeah.
7786078	7814533	a let's play of Tetris yo I did a four block we're done we could do a let's play you want to do a let's play we'll do that someday it'd be fun pick a game that's only a couple hours we could do Metroid 1 I could be Metroid 1 in about if I kind of what I'd have to do is I'd have to play through it the day before and then I could do a play through the night of and once I kind of remember where everything's at like it's one of those things you never forget but like you kind of want to play it one time to refresh your memory I could probably play through it in a couple hours once I just kind of remember where everything's at
7815202	7817583	You know that Amnesia game that's big on Steam?
7817683	7818143	Oh, God.
7818403	7824045	Where if you are in pitch blackness, you go crazy, and there's this scary monster that you have to hide from it?
7824546	7830228	The Let's Play of that game are hilarious, because there are people that are just in tears.
7832114	7832914	Hiding in the closet.
7832954	7833795	It's very scary.
7833815	7834515	It's a scary game.
7834535	7843939	Yeah, and for the people that record commentary of what they're doing in the game, Amnesia Let's Plays, look for the one on YouTube that has a couple hundred thousand hits and you will laugh.
7844659	7848760	Because this poor man, he thinks that he's really dying in real life.
7849101	7849961	He's very scared.
7850908	7853229	I need to find some sound clips from some of those and play them on the show.
7853269	7854050	I bet they're hilarious.
7854330	7856911	They're like the reaction videos to Two Girls, One Cup.
7860152	7860332	Right?
7860613	7861213	Something like that.
7862013	7862333	All right.
7862994	7865075	Let's move on with some rapid fire news.
7865475	7866475	And we'll start off with Loki.
7866736	7867596	Going to give us some quick news.
7867972	7869873	Yes, there's some rumors.
7869893	7874574	I mean, this is kind of a given that there will be like an Epic Mickey 2, something that did pretty well.
7875054	7876775	But coming from a... Really?
7877055	7878996	I thought it didn't do too well from what I heard.
7879016	7880316	It did pretty well for a Wii game.
7880496	7880776	All right.
7881696	7889299	Of course, there's some surveys going around asking people what their preferred packaging for Epic Mickey 2 would be.
7890039	7894623	And, um, a little bit, cause some details are kind of, uh, derived based on that.
7895183	7900647	Apparently, Epic Mickey 2, um, will feature Oswald the Lucky Rabbit as well.
7900747	7903069	It almost looks like as another playable character.
7903969	7910574	And, um, you know, uh, looks like it, they may do some sort of split screen with that as well.
7911155	7914657	And it looks like that Oswald, uh, can use his ears as kind of like a helicopter.
7915798	7915878	Um.
7917759	7918921	No real word, of course.
7920082	7926551	I'm sure this is maybe like a 2012 holiday game if it's being worked on right now.
7926751	7929956	They're probably not happy that this leaked if it is holiday 2012.
7930016	7930316	Yeah, so...
7934113	7936454	Yeah, I mean, it's definitely something that they're working on.
7936474	7940115	Could it be something where they're just gauging interest and it may not actually be being made at all?
7940296	7941456	Or do you think something like this happens?
7941616	7943617	I mean, because games aren't developed overnight.
7944077	7948779	So maybe this is one of those things where the games are already in development and it's like, you know, a year long or whatever.
7948799	7949599	I don't know about that.
7949619	7951540	I would think that they're actually working on it.
7951600	7959623	It says, like the screenshot that they have, it says, now we would like to show you a few more packages for Disney's Epic Mickey 2 video game.
7959663	7963745	Please indicate which package design makes you most interested in purchasing Disney's
7965867	7983986	I think the third one is the best out of those I agree with you yes which is just the two guys kind of it's not really an action shot everything else is an action shot and that except that second one where they're kind of jumping off into the two but you can't really see their faces which is a little weird to me yeah I like the third one it's pretty good
7984987	7986548	Anyhow, here we are taking the survey.
7987389	7987709	All right.
7988630	7988890	What else?
7989891	7990531	This is kind of cool.
7992092	7999097	Apparently, MadCatz has announced that they're going to be doing some official licensed Major League Gaming controllers.
7999538	8005101	Now, normally, if it were the case of the Major League Gaming, I wouldn't give a shit about it.
8005522	8007363	And their fight stick, it's expensive.
8007443	8012547	It just looks like one of the normal MadCatz fight sticks that they put out for a street fighter or something like that.
8013067	8013447	That's fine.
8013747	8016508	But what makes me interested, though, is actually their controller.
8016948	8021370	The controller that they've got out, yes, it's wired, but it's got a bunch of neat features.
8021390	8030593	For example, you're able to swap out the analog sticks if you want, and you can swap them between basically the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 ones.
8031053	8038995	Also, you'll be able to swap out the D-pad, and you can put in either a PlayStation 3 or the 360 D-pad.
8039676	8040536	That is awesome.
8041792	8045315	So I could have PlayStation 3 controls on my 360.
8046455	8046715	Yes.
8049797	8050838	Style controls.
8052039	8056421	I'm just, I'm a little bit flabbergasted and I'm partially kind of like, why haven't we seen this before?
8057182	8060964	Like, the 360 would be great if it had the PlayStation 3's controller.
8061364	8064126	Yeah, and it also includes placement.
8064246	8069109	So like, for example, you could put, you know, the analog sticks, you can move them around or whatever if you want.
8070342	8070602	Really?
8070822	8072383	Dan's saying they used to make a controller like that.
8072403	8073223	I just don't even remember.
8075304	8076644	Old school PlayStation era stuff.
8076824	8084607	No prices have been announced yet, but these controllers include the base controller, two pro module D-pads, one that's like the Xbox 360.
8085627	8086648	One that's like the PlayStation 3.
8087489	8088930	Four analog sticks.
8089110	8090351	Two that are like the 360.
8090972	8091872	Two that are like the PS3.
8092553	8093334	Two faceplates.
8093414	8095015	A matte finish or glossy finish.
8096196	8100199	A braided 3 meter cable that actually screws onto the controller.
8100259	8103342	Integrated weight compartment so you can adjust the weights on there.
8103582	8104983	It's getting more and more expensive.
8105283	8108206	And Pro Case that the whole thing is stored in.
8108266	8113530	Plus they're saying that they're going to be able to sell additional add-ons later on like customized
8115152	8115672	How much?
8116373	8116973	They haven't said.
8117914	8120376	I do know that the fight stick is like $150.
8121277	8127001	So I would hope that this is around the same price as a regular controller.
8128002	8129703	Although I'd imagine it's probably going to be around like $70, $80.
8130164	8133446	Yeah, I was going to say that looks $69.99 right there.
8134587	8137069	That's not bad if it's $69.99 because regular controllers are $60.
8137109	8140352	$10 extra, yeah, that might be worth it.
8141570	8148984	Yeah, and DarkTattoo is in our chatroom saying, See, I thought Rob might like this considering the 360's D-pad is ass.
8149585	8150066	Exactly.
8150506	8152009	I do like this, actually.
8153131	8153532	Interesting.
8155524	8155724	All right.
8155945	8156205	All right.
8156325	8161130	And then last but not least, Dance Central 2, they announced some tracks for that.
8161891	8164153	And actually, some of these are pretty awesome.
8165514	8166595	Hadaway, What Is Love.
8167196	8167737	Oh, my God.
8167877	8168237	Yes.
8169118	8170239	That is awesome.
8170359	8173903	That's that song from the club guys, the Saturday Night Live, The Night at the Roxbury.
8173923	8174503	That's what it's called.
8176465	8177987	Digital Underground with the Humpty Dance.
8180089	8192537	Sir Mix-a-Lot, Baby Got Back, The Mix Mix, not really sure what that is, Bobby Bound, My Prerogative, Curtis Blow, The Breaks, and Usher featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris, yeah.
8194138	8194858	So, not bad.
8195699	8197660	It's got a pretty kickass song list so far.
8198401	8200182	Definitely interested in this game, no surprise there.
8200560	8201160	Outro Music
8223584	8224905	Alright, well, I got some news for you guys.
8224945	8227606	It starts off with news on Zelda Skyward Sword.
8227646	8230867	There's going to be a $70 bundle that comes... Actually, I'm sorry to interrupt you real quick.
8230887	8231188	Yeah, go ahead.
8231428	8238871	I was going to say, they do, remember, have that mode, or maybe that's in Just Dance 3, but where you can create your own routines, so maybe... I don't think that was in Dance 3.
8238931	8239972	I don't think you think it's Just Dance.
8240052	8240372	Damn it!
8240612	8240852	Alright.
8241472	8247153	Uh, there's going to be a $70 Zelda Skyward Sword bundle, and it comes with the Wii Remote Plus.
8247274	8248314	It's a gold one.
8248814	8252575	Uh, that's good for those that never did buy a Wii Remote Plus, including myself.
8252735	8256896	I never bothered with the attachment or anything, but this is one of those, like, all-in-one Wii controllers.
8257476	8259597	So, IDK, I might have to pick this up.
8259657	8260277	I'm not sure yet.
8260337	8265158	I'm still not kind of sure how I feel about Zelda Skyward Sword, but you do, you have to have the, uh...
8265698	8266820	and Wii Motion Plus in order to play it.
8266840	8268121	You really should get one of those.
8268202	8269804	I don't know if I'd spend the extra money.
8269884	8270885	Well, it's not bad.
8271706	8273389	The controller itself is going to be, what, $40?
8273449	8274851	So I might as well get the game.
8274891	8277514	I just bought Wii Motion Pluses, so big deal.
8277554	8278816	My controller is a little longer.
8279684	8284626	Just so you know, it also comes with a CD from the Zelda 25th Anniversary Concert.
8285306	8287127	This all comes out on November 20th.
8287247	8293949	They are saying that the initial print of both the Wii controller and just the regular game by itself will have the CD.
8294569	8295129	That's pretty cool.
8296170	8299691	And the gold Wiimote's kind of neat, I guess, if you're into color collecting.
8300663	8314183	Burnout Crash coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and the date has been set September 20th and that'll set you back either 800 Microsoft points which is 10 bucks or $9.99 on PlayStation Network so you can save a whole penny
8315396	8320742	Radiant Silvergun is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and it's been dated for September 14th.
8320762	8321543	1,200 Microsoft points.
8321903	8322944	That's 15 bucks.
8323004	8324546	No word on a PlayStation Network version.
8324926	8327128	But yeah, it's not just a port.
8327189	8328770	I believe this is like a little remake.
8328830	8337800	It's going to have an online two-player co-op, Saturn and arcade-style game variants, different graphical modes, an Ikaruga scoring system.
8338629	8344052	I was going to say that was a big Saturn game when the Saturn tried to survive here.
8344072	8347834	And I think that's a former or previous classic game of the week.
8347894	8348415	Oh, I'm sure.
8348455	8352037	I'm sure Jamie probably has highlighted every treasure made game at some point.
8352077	8354298	So Radiant Silvergun on Xbox Live Arcade.
8354338	8361962	I know anybody who's a fan of shooters at all has got to be at least a little curious about this, if not just downright excited.
8363343	8364584	All right, let's move on.
8365665	8366845	Professor Layton 4.
8367766	8368366	We're getting it.
8368887	8369687	We're getting it soon.
8369707	8370808	We're getting it in October.
8373109	8376852	It is called Professor Layton and the Last Spectre.
8377672	8379253	It is the fourth game in the series.
8379353	8384016	It was just announced that we're getting it on the 3DS, even though it's not technically a 3DS game.
8385698	8407016	on October 17th and it's the Japanese version of the game came out with a little sort of Gaiden side story thing within this within the same cartridge called Professor Layton's London Life RPG we are getting that as well translated so we're getting the bonus game along with the proper sequel this October and uh
8410990	8418776	Also, in quickfire news, we have a bundle coming out for the Kinect, which is going to come with Child of Eden.
8420257	8424200	And the price point is going to be $150.
8424280	8428323	I'm not sure if that's... How much is the Kinect right now by itself, retail?
8428343	8428323	$100?
8428844	8431926	$150?
8428864	8431926	Loki, do you know off the top of your head?
8431966	8432066	Is it $150?
8432106	8432206	$150, yeah.
8432226	8433027	Yeah, and... So, yeah, that is...
8441400	8443560	Coming, let's see when the story is.
8445261	8447361	I think it's September 20th, if I remember correctly.
8448321	8450202	Yeah, I'm not seeing a date on this story glaring out at me.
8450222	8461063	But yeah, if you loved Rez, which is an amazing music and special effects game, Child of Eden, believe it or not, is easier to play with a controller.
8461623	8462544	I think so, yeah.
8462584	8466464	But seeing how the Kinect interface with the game is neat.
8466504	8470545	But yeah, so the Kinect is getting a bundle game, Child of Eden, soon.
8472189	8476171	I talked about this when I first reviewed Child of Eden, but I honestly think it's going to be better on the move.
8477332	8477912	But that's just me.
8480133	8483235	And finally, let's see if I can pronounce this right.
8484515	8487217	D3 is coming out with new...
8488775	8489395	Onichanbara.
8489615	8490895	Onichanbara, thank you, game.
8491496	8496237	Basically, you are bikini-clad Japanese schoolgirls.
8496317	8503218	It looks like it's kind of like a bastard on Dreamcast or Devil May Cry slasher game.
8503578	8504218	Very gory.
8504238	8506799	You're basically bikini schoolgirls killing zombies.
8507279	8509439	And when you kill a zombie, blood everywhere.
8509539	8510379	Blood splash.
8510800	8511840	Oh, God, so much blood.
8511860	8512940	She wears a bikini and a cowboy hat.
8513360	8513520	Yep.
8514621	8515041	That is it.
8515401	8520244	And it's an Xbox exclusive game coming out in Japan this winter.
8520645	8522626	So yeah, Onichanbara 2.
8523226	8525788	And we don't have part one here in the States.
8526428	8527169	But it sounds like something.
8527189	8527469	Oh, we do?
8527669	8527829	Yeah.
8527989	8528089	Oh.
8529470	8529730	Oh, yeah.
8529750	8532192	So if it comes out over there, then maybe we'll get the sequel here.
8534341	8535742	and Babes Killing Zombies.
8535842	8536562	What's not to love?
8550629	8555532	All right, I want to throw out one more plug for the upcoming indie segment here on the show.
8556253	8558794	Go figure, the week we're not here, I'm finally getting some bites on this.
8558814	8560476	So I think we're ready to roll this out next week.
8560496	8563037	But I do want to just say one more time before we roll out this segment.
8563938	8572744	If you have an indie game, if you're developing one, or you know people who are, and it could be for a PC, it could be for Xbox Live Indie Arcade, it could be iOS, I don't really care.
8573084	8576186	As long as you're independent, we want to feature more independent games.
8576186	8576747	Thanks for watching!
8596105	8598768	Twitter.com slash OLR We'll be getting to those shortly But first, a couple more stories
8614738	8619962	According to Howard Stringer, he is saying that the PlayStation Network is bouncing back.
8620483	8623165	Wait, Howard Stern, the shock jock DJ?
8623365	8623945	No, Stringer.
8624145	8624606	Oh, Stringer.
8624966	8625506	Not Stern.
8626487	8638876	He is basically saying the PlayStation Network is more secure and better than ever, and added that the company is working to expand the service, which has added 3 million new customers since the attack.
8640438	8646564	and sales have actually increased relative to the pre-attack levels.
8648326	8649708	So, interesting.
8650609	8652451	Told you people would forget about it in a few months.
8656283	8663145	Yeah, well, that's very not surprising that everybody's going to forgive and forget after a few months.
8664166	8666527	Except maybe those people who sold back their systems in a fit.
8666627	8666987	I don't know.
8670108	8672069	You know what I honestly think might be happening?
8672549	8677291	I think people stole all the Sony information and have been using it to hack the Xboxes.
8677311	8683633	I could swear I had different passwords on 360 and PlayStation Network, but now I'm thinking maybe I didn't.
8684354	8686037	And maybe that's how my Xbox was hacked.
8686077	8686438	I don't know.
8687148	8715291	but it's just interesting so alright anyhow story for you guys about something that was announced to E3 this year that had a lot of people very excited it was the Playstation 3D display bundle yes remember when they were going to be selling the monitor with Resistance 3 for $4.99 but then when they were like actually we're not going to put Resistance 3 in there we're going to put Motorstorm Apocalypse in there and some retailers were like well fuck you we're going to give Resistance 3 anyway so that way they pre-order with us well
8716710	8717912	Actually, this is interesting.
8718452	8722597	Sony has apparently made this their plan the whole time.
8723238	8729706	Resistance 3 is going to be included with any 3D display that was pre-ordered before September 30th.
8730467	8733210	Motorstorm, though, will be included no matter what.
8733971	8737572	So that's why Walmart, Amazon, and GameStop were putting out all these deals.
8737692	8741093	I guess the whole time, Sony was like, yeah, you can offer this deal.
8741654	8743474	And so it was to look like a pre-order.
8743494	8743814	I don't know.
8744594	8747695	Is it a brilliant marketing scheme, or do you feel a little used?
8747836	8748736	Eh, who cares?
8748756	8749476	It's just a TV.
8749696	8751377	I don't think it's selling as well as they'd hoped.
8751637	8751957	Really?
8753217	8753617	Well, come on.
8753637	8753777	It's a $499...
8755618	8758140	Yeah, but it's 3D and it comes with two games.
8758220	8759060	It's 24-inch.
8760001	8761042	It's not that bad.
8761182	8762723	That's perfect for a dorm room.
8762863	8763864	I would have loved this in college.
8763884	8770568	Yeah, it's perfect for a dorm room, but then you've got to buy another pair of glasses if you want to... It's expensive.
8770648	8778713	There's a small part of me that's interested, but then I go, but if I could kick down another $300, I could just get a large 3D TV.
8778813	8783997	They're just trying to get you to buy it now, but then you wait just a little longer and you're going to be able to get a...
8785298	8791262	You know, full-size HDTV that supports 3D for less money.
8791503	8793404	And think of how fast the technology is evolving.
8793464	8798948	I mean, right now they're trying to sell us on these active shutter glasses, which I've used them and they give you a headache.
8799609	8800750	And on Sony TV, too.
8801761	8813265	But, um, just wait until they've come out with some technology where, well, they already have it out, but, you know, where it becomes more mainstream, where it's either the non-shutter glasses, because each one of those is fucking $70.
8814665	8815665	$70 for a pair of glasses.
8815865	8816246	Wow.
8816426	8826809	When you can, you know, I hope they got the technology that they use for, um, you know, the Disney stuff or whatever, and in theaters with those cheap-ass $5 glasses, you know.
8827489	8829391	That's what needs to become mainstream.
8830531	8834014	I can't steal a pair of glasses from the theaters and use them on these TVs?
8834454	8836416	No, they're active shutter.
8836696	8840739	Isn't that what the fucking Sega Master System used?
8840759	8843461	Yeah, that's what all the old 3D systems used.
8843521	8846503	It was active shutter technology.
8846583	8851487	Even way back to the Vectrex was active shutter technology.
8851947	8879308	um you know the old school 3D stuff in um IMAX was active shutter stuff but what they need if they just you know really adopt that format with those cheaper glasses I think that'd be the way to go because then it's not a big deal like it I think people will be more interested in that it's like okay I only have to drop money on this it's like well if I want to watch 3D my family I've got to drop you know another I have to buy another four pairs of glasses and there's another three hundred dollars
8883001	8885663	I don't know, SalaciousPop, what do you think about these TVs?
8885703	8887284	Do you think this is something I should get for the house?
8889866	8893609	Knowing us, we'll just save up and go to Fry's and get the real deal.
8894010	8895691	We don't need the starter kit.
8896391	8897012	I guess that's true.
8897032	8900494	That's kind of where I'm at with this.
8900615	8904798	For college kids, I guess if you're in college and you need a 3D TV that'll fit in a dorm room.
8904838	8908000	I need a 3D TV in my dorm room amongst all the college expenses.
8908380	8908801	You know what?
8909421	8934880	My Super Nintendo And that wasn't even the cutting edge thing The kids upstairs had a Nintendo 64 And they were like the most popular kids in the dorm But I was probably second popular with my Mario Kart Knights In the dorm room And Duke Nukem 3 I mean, just wait If Sony's able to put out a monitor for $499 And Sony, I mean, they're known for being pretty high end As far as price points go on their products
8935660	8936080	Just wait.
8936100	8938901	They're going to be able to do that.
8939021	8945983	Right now, people aren't putting out 3D TVs that are 24 inches because who the fuck is going to buy that?
8946103	8951525	If you're going to buy an HD TV and have it 3D, it's going to be something that's being used in your living room.
8951545	8953305	You're going to want it to be pretty big.
8954606	8958907	If there's a demand for it, people put it out and they'll put it out cheaper and it'll be better technology.
8958967	8959647	Just wait.
8960487	8962488	You don't need to jump in the 3D right away.
8963708	8964029	All right.
8964509	8966651	Let's visit the mailbag and see what you guys think.
8966731	8968952	After all, we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8969273	8973216	We'd like to share your voices, not just through chat, but through email and Twitter and so forth.
8973276	8979741	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrainer.com is a place you can send us emails to get your longer thoughts out, more than 140 characters.
8980341	8985125	And Salacious Pop, sitting in for trying to fill Jamie's shoes tonight, is going to go ahead and take over the mailbag.
8986690	8989631	Okay, our first email tonight is from Osfer.
8990892	8993312	And he writes... I wasn't drunk, Osfer, I swear.
8995013	8995413	Ha ha.
8996153	8996694	Hi guys.
8996894	8997234	Hugs.
8997354	8999955	I miss you all and it's been a while since I wrote in, so here goes.
9000615	9005617	First off, as you saw on Twitter, I was in Disney World for a week and just returned on Monday, the 22nd.
9006297	9016041	I remember Rob mentioning something about Electronica in Disneyland and being the huge fan that I am of Tron Legacy, I was looking forward to seeing something like that at Disney World.
9016741	9022343	It turns out that there was nothing Tron related there other than some Blu-ray discs of the movie on some store shelves.
9022763	9024204	What exactly did I miss out on?
9024324	9028706	Tron was on the monorail for a short time, but nothing but a painting, really.
9029386	9031407	Disney World, they didn't do anything for Tron there, it's true.
9032757	9037220	Also, I've always wondered why there isn't a Kingdom Hearts attraction at any of the parks.
9038361	9040623	Probably because it's... I'm wondering that too.
9040683	9042124	That's a brilliant question.
9042704	9044686	It's like Disney refuses to acknowledge it.
9044966	9046427	Maybe because it's more a Square Enix thing.
9046447	9047208	They probably have to share...
9048008	9067429	The characters, money, royalties with Square Well, first off, I think, funny that he brought up Electronica It makes me feel justified for the 10 minute tangent in Part A But I think we kind of covered it in Part A, so I don't think I need to elaborate further But as far as Kingdom Hearts, I will tell you the one thing, one thing, two things I've ever seen Kingdom Hearts related in the park
9068190	9079455	Once, I was at a store called Off The Page in California Adventure, and now I go there every time because when I was there once, I saw a Sora figurine, and it was one of those nice ceramic figurines going for like 100 bucks.
9079675	9084137	It was that type of quality, like a ceramic doll, and I really wish I bought it, and I regret not buying it.
9085077	9112588	and that's the only thing Kingdom Hearts related I've ever seen in the park besides number two some parents brought their little kid once dressed as Sora and I saw them standing in line for the Haunted Mansion they were from Australia you know how sometimes little kids want to dress up and big kids can't dress up by the way they don't let you in Disneyland you have to be like seven or under if you want to wear a costume unless it's Halloween and you're at the Halloween party but we saw some Australian parents bring in their like six year old in a Sora costume and it was adorable
9113359	9115360	DarkTetsuya says there was a Sora statue in Innoventions.
9131050	9157748	and that I wouldn't you know I don't go in interventions a lot I gotta be honest interventions kind of weak and they really need to convert the building into something interesting but I wouldn't be surprised that they had a nod to Sora in there as well especially because last time I was in there which is a couple years ago they had Xbox 360 units that were the exact same things that were on the E3 show floor earlier that year so you know they get some use out of those year round
9159089	9161731	Does no one else think that a ride of some sort would be pretty awesome?
9161851	9163672	Again, this is in regards to Kingdom Hearts.
9164173	9169897	Or is it just something that Square Enix is holding back on for when they launch their own amusement park?
9170277	9170637	Smirk.
9170977	9171418	Or sigh.
9172718	9174400	I guess my dream shall suffice for now.
9174660	9181524	I would assume Disney Sea in Tokyo has more, but that's of course a huge assumption, and I don't really know.
9181564	9186508	I would have to rely on a Japanese listener who maybe has been there to tell me if Kingdom Hearts has more of a presence there.
9187068	9188369	I'm assuming, but I could be wrong.
9189090	9189510	I like that.
9189550	9189710	Tears.
9189750	9191372	It was on the show a couple weeks ago.
9191392	9191473	Okay.
9191493	9191593	Yeah.
9206711	9220367	and I'm going to end this email with one last question regarding 3DS colors you guys mentioned that the flare red 3DS would be coming out in the US in early September the thing is I'm holding out for the release of the purple 3DS that was shown on the floor at E3
9221368	9226691	That thing looked freaking beautiful, and he included a link to it, and it's gorgeous.
9226711	9227552	It's sexy.
9227912	9231774	It's very Prince, Joker, shade of deep purple.
9232074	9233916	Yeah, it's like the cool purple.
9233956	9237258	It's that metallic purple, not like the girly lavender.
9237338	9238178	It's not lavender.
9239119	9241300	That's a kid at ChrisColor if I ever saw one.
9242001	9244684	I didn't, you know, and I was at E3 that year too.
9244704	9246286	That's an eggplant purple right there.
9246426	9247107	Eggplant wizard?
9247327	9248909	Yeah, I like that.
9249850	9253534	I wish I remembered seeing that because that is a sexy 3DS.
9255054	9257454	Well, I may consider getting the Flare Red system.
9257534	9260295	Is there any word on more colors coming out in the near future?
9260315	9263356	No, they haven't announced anything other than the Flare Red one, and they're not going to.
9264096	9265916	Just wait for them to make their announcement.
9266076	9271837	Yeah, wait for that Tokyo event, because that could be, but that's probably going to be more Japan.
9273877	9274578	But you never know.
9274718	9281959	I would still say hold out until after the Tokyo event, which won't be that long after the Flare Red DS is out anyway, 3DS is out anyway.
9284401	9284601	It could.
9284661	9284902	It could.
9284942	9285142	It could.
9302082	9302362	and DarkSakura
9318222	9327226	The first or the two thirds of the email is basically just a verbatim talking about the Deus Ex GameStop removing the code controversy.
9327547	9332949	So the first 30 minutes of the show is really for you, Holly.
9332969	9338872	I'm not going to read it just because it's literally just saying what happened and how there was a leaked memo and blah, blah, blah.
9339352	9348658	So the commentary, seriously, I've been off GameStop for a while, but I still went in and looked now and then, and I still considered buying things from there.
9349239	9356603	But coupled with what Sky has been saying lately in this, referring to the code scandal with Deus Ex, well, this is the final straw.
9357044	9361426	No more, now it's Power Gamer, Best Buy, or online retailers.
9361547	9362867	GameStop can stuff it.
9366111	9375643	Yeah, I mean, we kind of talked to death about it the first 30 minutes of the show, but I think what Holly's saying in her email echoes what quite a few people are thinking this week.
9375823	9376885	It will be interesting.
9377906	9381871	I would like to go back and ask these people in a year, did you stick with it?
9384372	9385833	I would ask myself that in a year too.
9385933	9390177	Did I stick with it or did I break down because GameStop had some stupid exclusive that I had to have?
9390397	9390937	I'm trying to think.
9390957	9393600	If they get a Skyrim exclusive, I'm going to be so goddamn pissed.
9393660	9397543	I don't remember the last time I was in a GameStop.
9397763	9398243	Me neither.
9398564	9399785	For anything.
9399965	9401486	I remember the last game I bought.
9401566	9403207	We look when we go in the mall.
9404629	9407231	We've gone in the mall and looked, but it's more of a...
9407691	9409252	Well, what's new?
9409392	9410372	I forget what games are out.
9410612	9412573	Even though I do this show, sometimes I forget what games are out.
9412593	9423777	I think the last time I was in there, well, one of the times I remember was when I was picking up extra copies of episodes from Liberty City just to stock the other machines we have.
9424177	9430020	But I don't think I bought a new game from them for a long time.
9430040	9432901	Yeah, I don't remember the last thing I bought at one.
9434181	9434501	Do you?
9435182	9435722	I don't remember.
9436082	9461023	usually when we go in it's to see what obscure thing that they have for 360 or PS3 that's used at a decent price and usually oh that's priced too high for a used game and we leave I still have a gift card there it's like that same story every time isn't it I like their magazine sometimes we're just fucking bored and you want to go window shop you know like even though everything I said about the place is just kind of whatever it's here let's just go in and look I'm not going to buy anything but I'll look
9461543	9469237	And sometimes, you know, and this goes for a lot of places, they may have good deals on like rock band equipment or something like that if you need some of that.
9469338	9472183	I mean, because it's so dirt cheap nowadays.
9476182	9478664	and our final email is from Chiggers.
9480966	9483288	This is sent through our comment system on the site.
9498419	9506222	Can you think of any other more recent games that have historical facts and whether or not you think it would be used more in today's games as a teaching tool?
9506522	9510003	I can think of God of War would be good for mythology.
9510523	9514645	That's a stretch, but okay.
9514885	9519907	It would make you more aware of what different gods were, titans were.
9520087	9522968	The Pantheon is accurate, Athena, Ares, that's all.
9523308	9528310	All the edutainment games that I think of that I learned shit from is obviously very old and dated.
9528370	9534552	I think of Oregon Trail, I think of Number Munchers, absolutely Carmen Sandiego, Math Blasters, but all that shit's old.
9534872	9538433	But at the same time, actually, a lot of that shit is still around.
9538953	9541854	Like, I believe Math Blasters still exists in some form.
9542295	9544835	I want to say... Oregon Trail's been remade.
9544895	9545956	Oregon Trail's been remade.
9546016	9547816	Now it's a Facebook game and kids have that.
9547876	9549017	It's different now.
9549597	9552959	Yeah, so a lot of those games actually still exist.
9553079	9554399	Like, they've been updating them.
9554780	9566125	We just don't follow them because we're not six or seven anymore, except the occasional retro cool, oh, LOL, Oregon Trail on Facebook, ha ha ha, I made Salacious Pop die of dysentery, right?
9566485	9567926	Like, that's about the extent of it.
9567986	9570387	But who really sits down to play an edutainment game anymore?
9570407	9570607	Not a lot.
9570627	9572388	But I don't think I learned anything from Oregon Trail.
9575273	9578995	You learned that if you killed 4,000 pounds of buffalo, you could only take 10 pounds of it back.
9580275	9581676	I learned that that was fun, yes.
9581756	9585858	You learned where does the Oregon Trail start?
9585878	9587539	I don't know.
9588379	9591181	Independence, Missouri, and that's why I remember that from the game.
9591981	9593542	See, I learned nothing from the Oregon Trail.
9593682	9596903	Of course, I hope I got that right or I'm going to sound hella stupid.
9596943	9599004	I guess I didn't learn anything from the Oregon Trail whatsoever.
9599705	9601185	It starts in Florida.
9602026	9602166	No.
9603231	9607062	I need to click on this IGN article and see what's actually being quoted here.
9607323	9607965	Oh, come on.
9608206	9609650	You know there's nothing valuable there.
9611366	9629818	For those that played Bioshock, the first one, the whole story of Rapture, the Under the Sea City, was based off of Anne Rand, the Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged, the objectivism approach to politics, which is some pretty highbrow adult concepts.
9629918	9637123	You wouldn't really know who Anne Rand is from playing that game, but the antagonist was Andrew Ryan, obviously a play on her name.
9637564	9640786	So that was a game developer saying, let's take this whole,
9642287	9660670	you know way of thinking that a lot of adults you apply to their politics and make a video game based on based on it I don't know that that was kind of an intellectual angle for a game did you play Bioshock did you pick up on any of that um I played a little bit of it but I more picked up because I didn't get to that killer twist ending that everybody talks about
9661330	9662872	because I'm terrible at first person shooters.
9663032	9665694	I was more like, wow, this game is really good looking.
9665755	9666695	Great game.
9667176	9668037	Yeah, I know.
9668137	9669198	Well, here's the thing.
9669258	9674002	Now that you just told me that if I wait for Bioshock Infinite on PlayStation 3, I can get the first game for free.
9674142	9675624	Yeah, that's like in a year.
9676244	9677526	It's over a year from now.
9677586	9678467	Dude, just seriously.
9678527	9680669	I don't think I have the first game.
9680869	9683371	Is there a skill level where like any dope can get through?
9683391	9684632	Yeah, you can play it on easy.
9684853	9685113	Okay.
9685693	9687194	Is it like Prey where you never die?
9687214	9689416	That's the only reason I could play Prey.
9689436	9694560	You die, but there's respawn points and it's not like you're dead forever.
9694640	9695441	Alright, I could do that.
9696542	9701485	Steam has had Bioshock 2 on sale for $8 and you get 1 for free.
9701505	9706049	2 I wasn't a big fan of, although I should really go back and play it, but 1 was great.
9706149	9706890	It was a great game.
9706930	9711193	That's why I'm so... Infinite looks... It looks great.
9711753	9712554	I just can't wait to play it.
9713269	9714150	The Civilization Series
9731272	9732393	Excellent point.
9732453	9734154	The Civ series are amazing.
9735415	9742399	Dan just handed me a copy of Bioshock on the PlayStation 3 from the vault and gave me that here, take it, look.
9742619	9744420	So I guess I'm playing Bioshock.
9744440	9745100	You need to finish it.
9745140	9747601	You don't get to keep it.
9748082	9751404	Well, can I keep it as long as DarkSakura keeps some of my shit?
9751524	9752004	Because...
9755746	9756226	Alright.
9757066	9759667	I think she had my copy of Clue for like two years.
9760807	9762007	I thought it was my copy of Clue.
9762027	9765148	I was like, where the fuck did I get this?
9765168	9765888	Oh, that's Rob's.
9766968	9767488	They can't hear you.
9767508	9768108	They can't hear you, Dan.
9768168	9768448	Alright.
9769208	9770149	Moving on.
9770169	9772309	So that's it for the mailbag.
9772349	9772949	Thanks for writing in.
9773189	9774609	Thanks for reading tonight.
9774909	9777790	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to do that in the future.
9778150	9778670	I like that.
9778730	9780010	I can't believe I didn't think of that answer.
9780030	9781291	I just talked about that in my freaking week.
9781351	9782231	Civilization Games.
9782311	9782791	Absolutely.
9783371	9791895	You learn about some of the great leaders and sometimes the units that they get that are special talk about their culture or are kind of something to that culture.
9793516	9797758	You're not going to learn detailed facts but sometimes you're playing scenarios and things like that.
9797999	9799459	That's a great answer.
9799719	9806783	Maybe some of the World War II Call of Duty games or Battlefield games you may learn a little bit about history and stuff there.
9807623	9807984	I don't know.
9809604	9809885	Alright.
9811232	9814897	Moving on, let's talk about the FUs of the week.
9815057	9817520	Oh, every week here on the program we get angsty.
9817621	9817981	Why?
9818281	9819283	Because we can.
9819403	9822207	We have a microphone and your attention, so we're going to rant.
9822287	9822968	That's what people do.
9840533	9841694	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
9842114	9843675	Fuck you to the Marx system.
9843755	9853799	For those who are unaware of what the Marx system is, think of it like an enhanced version of the Dewey Decimal System, or like a bibliography for everything in the goddamn world.
9854419	9859481	I fucking had to learn that shit this week, and it was boring as hell.
9859862	9862183	It's like libraries are so fucking old school.
9862883	9863823	Get with the times.
9864143	9864684	They have to like...
9865524	9869726	It's ridiculous all the crap that they break down about each individual thing.
9870406	9874848	Mainly, I was looking for DVDs and games, but oh my god, it was boring.
9874988	9880090	And I had to learn the Dewey Decimal System for a little bit, which actually, Dewey Decimal System isn't as complicated as I thought, which is great.
9880450	9881670	But I still don't care.
9882351	9882951	So fuck you, though.
9883871	9884512	Slay just popped.
9884532	9885392	Do you have any reviews of the week?
9887177	9896807	This might be taking from your FUs, but FU to giant huge spiders that like to make webs above our front door, so we have to not walk into them.
9897528	9898148	He's big.
9898289	9902353	I don't want to... I need to spray acid on him, or the pesticide, the raid.
9903354	9904255	It's a big spider.
9904575	9907618	You need to open the door, spray it, and close it real fast.
9907778	9908719	No, I'm going to do it from the patio.
9909500	9910141	Oh, that's a good idea.
9910581	9913763	Stun him with Windex, follow up with Bug Spree afterwards.
9913783	9914763	That's why I did that with the fly.
9914783	9917845	It basically knocked the fly out of the air.
9917906	9918846	He couldn't fly anymore.
9919106	9920507	Got him with Ray turned upside down.
9921108	9925290	Who knew we were going to learn bug killing tips on tonight's Orange Launch Radio?
9926391	9930334	Yeah, he hides up in the corner in the day and then he just parks in the middle of this huge ass web at night.
9930614	9931734	And he's like, walk into us.
9932095	9932895	I will eat your face.
9932975	9934656	It's a big fucking spider, people.
9935377	9937118	The spider is not playing.
9938377	9950369	and also FU2Cats who become manic and agitated when they're left home alone for four days when their owners go to Disneyland and they eat AV cables.
9950890	9953993	Did I mention that I lost a $50 set of headphones this week?
9955114	9969845	We came home from Disneyland and said, oh yay, the cats didn't, you know, shit and pee everywhere, and we turned on our PCs, and we look at our headsets that we use for Ventrilo on World of Warcraft, and they, on mine, they chewed that thing clean through, yours was just not up.
9970606	9971366	Unusable, of course.
9971386	9972167	Unusable, thank you.
9972407	9975770	But yeah, they've already been, I replaced them.
9976570	9978792	Rob was without his headset for 48 hours, I replaced them.
9978812	9979973	And it was the most painful...
9980873	9982114	48 hours of my life!
9982574	9984355	No, I had a backup headset, thank God.
9984455	9989557	And of course, the generous and graceful and wonderful DarkSakura did play cat sitter.
9989938	9990298	She did.
9990598	9992619	She came in and fed them and cleaned them.
9992639	9994180	Clearly, she did a terrible job.
9994220	9995881	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
9995901	9997041	My cats are assholes.
9997061	9997781	They don't know her.
9998022	10002644	They ran away from her and they decided we're gonna, because they see us at those computer desks all day.
10003444	10005345	So they just ate our headsets for fun.
10006326	10007566	Asshole cats.
10007966	10008967	Just teach us a lesson.
10009187	10009367	Yeah.
10009767	10011728	And then, by the way, we're leaving again at the end of the month.
10012288	10013909	Yeah, for another four or five days.
10013949	10015729	You shut the door to the office last night, I saw.
10015749	10016610	Oh, I did?
10017050	10018110	Yeah, were you afraid of that?
10018190	10019871	I thought maybe you were afraid of that happening overnight.
10019891	10022112	No, I left my computer on and my computer's loud.
10022552	10023232	Oh, okay.
10023252	10024373	Because I'm seeding torrents.
10025633	10026593	Ooh, what porn did you get?
10026693	10027374	Alright, moving on.
10029494	10031335	Going on to my FUs.
10031535	10033815	Funny enough, not the FUs I was thinking of.
10034455	10046779	The FU I'm thinking of tonight, FU to the fact that this morning I was supposed to get up at 9am, but I set my alarm on a weekday alarm on my iPhone, the same one as my work alarm.
10046799	10049480	You know sometimes you just change the time on the alarm without thinking it?
10049520	10050980	Oh yeah, it was only set for weekdays.
10051280	10053181	We're supposed to meet some people for brunch at 10.30?
10053262	10054442	We go to gay brunch every Sunday.
10054482	10055023	I try to.
10055163	10056364	I get a text message at 10.20.
10056484	10057605	We have a table.
10057645	10058125	It's in the back.
10058966	10059606	Oh, fuck.
10059646	10060727	And the text message woke me up.
10061107	10061187	2A.
10061468	10063009	Oh, fuck!
10063069	10064470	I think that's what you heard this morning, right?
10064510	10065290	That's what you woke up to?
10065311	10065951	Yeah.
10067652	10067912	Oops.
10068493	10069313	So F you to myself.
10069354	10072856	So yeah, we had to flake and say that we are lazy slugs and we slept.
10073156	10073997	We missed brunch.
10074017	10077620	The sound of gay man judgment coming through the phone.
10077680	10078881	You could just feel it.
10079401	10080462	You know what I'm talking about.
10083624	10084144	Alright, anyhow.
10086085	10086685	Moving on.
10088045	10093467	More news stories and then the Twitter and Skype line coming up at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10093487	10094707	Our toll-free number's back this week.
10094727	10095167	Hooray!
10096187	10102309	So, there's been a new break in the console hacking industry.
10103593	10104734	I don't know, scene, if you will.
10105355	10120110	Apparently, there is now a new exploit called the Reset Glitch Hack that allows any Xbox 360, any from now, before, and in the future to be turned into a JTAG console, period.
10120910	10124514	Apparently, it is an exploit that cannot be patched, and...
10126616	10129078	People have already found a way to... That sounds pretty definitive.
10129238	10149933	They've found a way to load this program called Zelle, which is kind of like a front-end for... They don't have any rebooters yet, which means you can't run a custom firmware on it yet, but right now you can launch homebrew stuff, and they have a video of someone actually running a Nintendo 64 emulator on their Slim, and...
10151670	10156033	you know a lot of people are going to use it for piracy
10173001	10177523	Well, at least right now there's no way to take JTAGs online without them being banned immediately.
10178604	10184347	Once people figure a way around that, then yeah.
10184547	10185067	It's interesting.
10188673	10189854	You have a JTAG, so it doesn't matter.
10191114	10191434	I don't know.
10191454	10192475	I'm just... I don't know.
10194055	10201938	I talked about this on the last show, which was two weeks ago, about when I talked about how I finally did the Wii because Joystick put the instructions up that made it look so easy.
10202598	10204739	And it's kind of like, you know, I have to really have a reason to do it.
10204859	10209001	And now my reason for at least the Wii is being able to play shit that Nintendo won't release in this country.
10209521	10210061	It's kind of nice.
10210521	10211582	So, I don't know.
10212442	10214043	I don't have a reason yet to do that to my 360.
10215837	10240997	Well, my 360 I use a lot for editing Grand Theft Auto So I use it to test stuff instead of having to burn discs every time Because back in the day when I first started doing Grand Theft Auto mods I did have to burn discs every time And I had a stack of discs that were just ridiculous So it does save me a lot of money in that sense Plus you can do mods and trainers and stuff like that on games And it's kind of fun
10242386	10242586	Persona 4
10262245	10263967	It's going to be out in Japan in 2012.
10264047	10265850	They're going to be enhancing some things.
10266330	10273619	New animation, one new character, new voice acting, wireless support where you can call others if you think you're about to die in a dungeon and so forth.
10274079	10274540	Crazy.
10274960	10278865	Also announced, however, which is very interesting, a Persona fighting game.
10279225	10280667	It's by Arc System Works.
10280847	10282129	You know them, BlazBlue, right?
10283009	10287012	It's Persona 4, The Ultimate, and Mayonaka Arena.
10287392	10289134	It's going to hit arcades in spring of 2012.
10290154	10293497	Apparently, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions will come out later in the summer.
10293897	10296018	So, Persona fans have a lot to be excited about.
10297615	10304343	I have Persona 3, the Hela edition that came out for the PS2, because it came out twice, Persona 3 and then the second edition.
10305024	10309409	And then I hear that the PSP port of Persona 3 that came out a year or two ago is even better than that.
10309509	10316558	And aren't those games, I haven't gotten really into a lot of the Persona games, but aren't they very big on like, it's kind of like a do whatever you want type of RPG, isn't it?
10317334	10317754	Some are.
10317854	10322737	A lot of them run on a calendar system where you have a certain amount of time in a day to do something.
10323337	10332521	But Persona 4 addressed some pretty adult concepts that aren't really that controversial, but they are because video games are for kids, of course.
10333521	10335162	that they handled very maturely.
10335442	10337262	And I'm glad that that content is there.
10337603	10339563	But yeah, and I have Persona 4 for the PS2.
10339903	10340323	I didn't know that.
10340343	10341024	Collector's Edition.
10341044	10342004	Yeah, it's on our shelf.
10342124	10342704	Never touched it.
10342724	10345745	Now this edition for the Vita may as well wait for the new one.
10345905	10346706	It's got more shit in it.
10346866	10348826	That adult content he's talking about is dick pics, of course.
10349566	10352027	Drawn in the instruction manual, of course.
10352287	10352768	Tastefully.
10353088	10353548	Tastefully.
10354308	10354568	All right.
10355268	10356109	Anyhow, so let's pop.
10356129	10357189	Why don't you give us another news story?
10359629	10364033	This was pretty huge on the internet last week, maybe the week before.
10364813	10370659	Basically a fan YouTube or a Flash animation of Super Mario Bros.
10371119	10372040	with Portal Gun.
10374042	10376224	Because of Portal 2, Portal Gun is awesome.
10376684	10380988	Everyone watched it on Newgrounds or YouTube and everyone laughed and it was great.
10381568	10385432	Let me play a little clip here in the background so you can kind of hear the noises.
10385968	10394416	A studio, it's a two-man team that calls themselves Stab Yourself, so Stab Yourself Studios.
10394717	10395678	Oh, what a pleasant name.
10395938	10399061	That's like one of the old-school Nintendo emulators.
10399101	10400062	Remember Nesticle?
10400763	10401723	Yeah, Genesis.
10401804	10402885	Yeah, charming names.
10403826	10406128	They are making Super Mario Bros.
10406168	10406989	with a portal gun.
10407849	10432286	uh for real they are working on it hopefully Valve and I know won't shut it down but um they have a proof of concept no Valve will just hire him yeah oh yeah absolutely Valve will just hire him to make a Mario clone that has the portal guns in it watch that's how Valve responds to things and they have sort of an alpha proof of concept YouTube up and you can see what the gameplay is like and it looks pretty awesome it's nice I think it's cool
10436721	10439984	Of course, is it going to be one of those games you play for five minutes and you're like, eh-huh?
10440364	10448091	Well, I know on Newgrounds there was the big... It's Super Mario Brothers, but you can play it as Samus and Kid Icarus, one of the Contra dudes.
10448451	10449572	Super Mario Crossover.
10450293	10451134	It reminds me of that.
10451414	10452175	Yeah, it does a little bit.
10452235	10461523	But yeah, they're saying that they're working on it and they've got a YouTube channel up for progress, but who knows if this will ever see the light of day or if it's going to get Nintendo to go shut it down.
10462878	10463198	We'll see.
10464399	10466721	All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys before we get to calls.
10466841	10471985	They should really get Gordon Ramsay to do the announcements for when they're going to say, Shut it down!
10474267	10475828	You're thinking Hell's Kitchen, right?
10475869	10477630	Yeah, Gordon Ramsay, yeah.
10478010	10478711	I've seen that show.
10479531	10480952	That show's been on how long?
10480972	10481612	It is terrible.
10481652	10483292	And it's on season 8 or 9?
10483612	10485053	It's so predictable.
10485193	10486933	Every challenge ends with a tie.
10487073	10490174	I know this has nothing to do with video games, but I gotta say... Wait, what show is this?
10490214	10490954	Hell's Kitchen.
10491294	10493775	It's been the same fucking show for 9 years.
10494315	10495015	Like, it really has.
10495255	10502877	Like, at least something like Survivor or Big Brother has the different people that get into the different conflicts and there's different twists and so forth.
10503137	10505458	But in Hell's Kitchen, the twists don't even matter.
10505758	10506118	Like, you...
10507159	10509161	I just turned it on randomly one day.
10509442	10516612	I had no idea who the fuck any of the people were, what season it even was, but I was just like, LOL, he's yelling at him.
10516832	10517813	He's really mean.
10518174	10519235	This show's funny.
10520738	10522079	It's the same fucking thing every week.
10522700	10525942	Someone on my Facebook who I went to high school with, he was one year below me.
10526563	10534108	I added him on Facebook a couple months ago, and I guess he's a trained chef from some San Francisco culinary academy.
10534208	10535428	He's trying to get on that show.
10535809	10536129	Oh, okay.
10536169	10538610	So he's trying to audition for Hell's Kitchen, yeah.
10539431	10540512	He may as well go on Top Chef.
10540552	10541072	It's a better show.
10541092	10541412	That's right.
10541452	10544414	People tell me I should be on Big Brother, and I'm like, I'm not cute enough for Big Brother.
10544434	10546936	But then they point out, well, you know, Adam's on there.
10547136	10549539	Here's a tip for anybody that's going on Hell's Kitchen.
10549639	10551040	The menu's always the same.
10551301	10554384	Learn how to cook the things on the goddamn menu and you'll be fine.
10554704	10555145	That's it.
10555365	10556466	It's always the same.
10556486	10557988	There's always a fucking risotto.
10558148	10559930	There's always a fucking chicken.
10560130	10561612	There's always a fish entree.
10561632	10563594	It's always the same goddamn thing.
10564034	10565256	Just learn how to cook that.
10565416	10566077	You're done.
10566137	10566517	You're set.
10566537	10568139	You're gonna have your own fucking restaurant.
10569505	10570406	And don't talk back.
10570466	10571708	I think you need to go on Hell's Kitchen.
10571968	10572809	I don't know how to cook.
10573750	10577674	Although if I did, I would learn how to cook the risotto and cook all that shit.
10578335	10581659	And then when he's like, this is what a risotto is supposed to taste like, I'm like, that's right, bitch.
10582099	10583401	That's right, you should have done it this way.
10585305	10585846	and you just don't talk.
10585866	10587668	I'll call me if you fucking call me a bitch.
10588108	10589349	No, I wouldn't talk to him though.
10589369	10590650	I'd talk to the other people that way.
10590671	10591832	You'd piss them off.
10591992	10599820	I love the stunt cake shows where they have to make this huge Spongebob square pants with like a fucking Ferris wheel and like a waterfall.
10599840	10603583	No, he's talking about, you know, Food Network Challenge or whatever.
10603663	10603964	It's always...
10604304	10605024	Thanks for watching!
10625053	10629177	and then I can watch Unwrapped with Mark Summers because it's Mark Summers!
10629237	10632381	I was really into Top Chef until I got too invested in it.
10632401	10633302	I see replays of it.
10633362	10634803	Yeah, replays are no new shows.
10634823	10636045	Aw, that's a bummer.
10637406	10640650	I watch a ton of Food Network.
10641150	10642070	A ton of Food Network.
10642210	10646392	When I lived with him, Nelly would come over and they would watch Food Network.
10646412	10651353	That's how I got to watching some of these shows because I'd just be kind of sitting there and I'd go, like, fucking food looks so fucking good.
10651393	10654894	Oh my god, this show's about, oh my god, it's an Unwrapped on Pringles.
10655094	10656055	Died!
10656835	10658576	We watch a lot of Food Network.
10658736	10659336	It's great.
10659416	10662758	I like watching Chopped because it's like a mini Iron Chef.
10662878	10663639	It's actually pretty good.
10663659	10664179	I like it.
10664199	10664659	It's pretty cool.
10664939	10667200	Hosted by Ted Allen from Queer Eye.
10668101	10669121	I really wish that show was on TV.
10669161	10670082	I love that show.
10670182	10670842	It's sad.
10670902	10671423	It's gone.
10672803	10674964	I do... We don't understand.
10675024	10677406	My guilty pleasure shows are makeover shows.
10677606	10679927	I love makeover shows.
10680607	10684509	Not necessarily people makeover... Loki is the straight one on the show.
10684829	10686550	Not necessarily people makeover shows.
10686670	10690652	It's like, you know, like the car makeover shows.
10691053	10692153	The Pimp My Ride.
10692994	10694474	There's a house makeover show.
10694794	10698536	I don't watch that, but they have Restaurant Impossible now.
10698576	10699857	It's a restaurant makeover show.
10700097	10701338	Do you watch Extreme Makeover?
10701878	10701978	No.
10702718	10703679	Did you watch The Swan?
10704099	10704279	No.
10704799	10707581	No, I don't watch the PeopleMaker episode.
10707881	10710742	I like them, like, building stuff, you know?
10710822	10713323	Like, I used to watch Junkyard Wars and stuff like that.
10713583	10716765	You know, stuff where they're taking a... Pin My Ride's kind of dumb.
10716845	10718666	I mean, they're like, oh, let's put 50 TVs in there.
10718686	10719486	That doesn't make any sense.
10719926	10725749	But, like, I like watching them, you know, do stuff to cars and, like, remake them and stuff.
10725789	10727150	Like, I used to watch the...
10727870	10731532	The Jesse James one or whatever, Monster Garage and stuff like that.
10731572	10732513	Those shows are awesome.
10733953	10735614	And Queer Eye was a good show.
10735754	10736635	I liked that show.
10736735	10737575	It was good.
10738376	10742178	Because the people that were on the show, the five guys that they had on there were great.
10742458	10743879	And now they have all their own stuff.
10743939	10744839	And Ted Allen's awesome.
10744879	10746460	He's one of the best people on the show.
10746480	10749862	One of them's on Dancing with the Stars.
10749882	10753244	Yeah, Carson, the blonde who was in charge of clothes.
10753764	10754064	I think?
10754324	10755624	He's, yeah, he's on Dancing with the Stars.
10755784	10764946	And people, it's so funny because people are not even talking about, like, when Lance Bass, a gay guy, was on Dancing with the Stars, you know, Middle America was all, oh my god, I can't believe, why aren't they partnering with another man?
10765006	10765587	It's so gross.
10765647	10766147	It's a family show.
10766427	10773228	Like, people aren't even fucking talking about Carson because they totally upped the ante by putting a transgender person on this year with Chaz Bono.
10773288	10781290	It's like, no one, no one cur that you're gay because we got a transgender and they're, oh my god, it's ruining America and all this bullshit.
10781470	10781850	Like, just...
10782270	10783351	What the hell were we talking about before?
10783371	10784012	I don't even remember now.
10784232	10789717	I don't know, but my point is if Chaz Bono wants to dance, god damn it, let him dance.
10791558	10794241	Shut the fuck up just because you can't dance.
10795702	10797323	And they'll have Gordon Ramsay come out and yell at him.
10797483	10800066	That'll bring it back to the top of the story.
10800226	10804069	But I do hope Ace of Cakes comes back this fall because I miss that show.
10804089	10809274	The way it ties into video games is there's a fucking DS game for every one of these goddamn shows we just mentioned.
10810402	10812003	Iron Chef, and it was terrible, yes.
10812523	10813943	I played that at PAX one year.
10813963	10816064	It was better than Cooking Mama.
10816124	10817525	Yeah, but it ended up being terrible.
10818345	10818705	All right.
10820786	10823046	Can we move on, Loki, with the gaming news story?
10823066	10823627	We can move on.
10824147	10828468	EA's trying to downplay the whole Origin exclusivity of their titles.
10828528	10835411	They're basically saying competition and choice go hand in hand, so the fact that we only distribute our own games...
10836471	10838233	On our own platform, I don't see that.
10839674	10850744	He explained that basically the company is in discussions with other publishers to have their games on Origin, but EA's key focus is to develop an impressive consumer experience where people are happy to play and buy games.
10851465	10853326	You're just fucking competing with Valve, okay?
10853346	10855028	Just stop dancing around it.
10855088	10860513	You're trying to compete with Valve, and it's just an awkward situation because you publish Valve games as well, so...
10862628	10891464	whatever so Battlefield 3 won't be on there big deal you know what I don't care you know I heard a story later in the week though about I guess Valve games are now showing up on yeah the PC ones like the actual physical games that EA published are showing up on their site but not any digital stuff alright one more story for you guys
10893726	10898208	Square Enix is going to be expanding and they're expanding Eidos Montreal.
10898448	10902030	They're going to be adding 350 employees over the next few years up to 2015.
10902490	10905871	Of course, they're not saying exactly what it is they're developing.
10905932	10908513	They haven't really officially announced this either.
10908893	10912895	But there's a report that's out there from La Presse Affaires.
10912995	10913935	It's a French name.
10913995	10915136	La Presse Affaires.
10915156	10915636	I don't know.
10916396	10916897	Le Precifé
10935229	10944413	And, you know, I think this is important to point out because with all these news of game studios closing and going under, it's nice to hear about some expanding, isn't it?
10945314	10949155	Montreal, Eidos, I believe, is making the fourth Thief game.
10949215	10950636	Remember the Thief series?
10951156	10952657	That's one of the big things they're working on.
10952737	10954177	So that's pretty cool.
10954458	10956739	And, of course, I'm sure there's secret products and all that good stuff.
10957319	10957439	So...
10958703	10963206	Alright, well, that brings us to phone calls!
10963687	10967289	So if you want to give us a call, you can.
10967309	10972533	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
10973451	10974371	and we'll talk to you.
10974932	10978113	Otherwise, we're going to go to the Twitter and get some Twitter topics.
10978913	10979813	I got to load up Twitter.
10980714	10981574	I forgot to load up Twitter.
10981774	10983875	But you know what I did load up for Loki, actually?
10984855	10986956	I didn't get Twitter up, but I did get this up for Loki.
11000520	11001621	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11001641	11002021	Who's this?
11004097	11005057	This is me.
11005838	11007998	Hi, Miklatov Shane, whatever you want to call me.
11008018	11009919	Hi, Miklatov Shane, whatever you want to call me.
11009999	11010799	What's on your mind tonight?
11011979	11021842	Well, first I would like to say that I really just ditched a group in WoW to call, so we're all going to die because I'm the healer, but I just got up off my computer and went to the other room.
11022062	11024642	You know what they say, real life greater than WoW.
11026163	11026403	What?
11026603	11031564	Well, no, not always, but in this case, sure, why not?
11032742	11035343	Well, what was worth ditching the group to talk to us about tonight?
11036524	11040125	Well, first off, I'm still really mad about Electronica.
11040145	11044446	Not going to be up and running when I go to Anaheim in a couple weeks.
11044886	11053009	Well, what about Ossifer who emailed us saying that he went to Disney World expecting to see a version of it there and he got the shaft.
11053329	11054390	He got Tron on Blu-ray.
11054410	11054990	That's what he got.
11056410	11058971	Well, you know, that's a good movie.
11058991	11060832	So, I mean, at least he gets something out of it.
11061704	11067569	I'm going to go there and I'm not going to get anything because there won't be a store, there won't be a show.
11067589	11069010	No, I said go to D Street.
11069070	11071272	The D Street store has the Tron jackets.
11071292	11072754	That's where all the hats and jackets end.
11072774	11074315	Haven't you seen my Tron jacket?
11074335	11076076	Didn't you see that and you were like, I want one?
11076096	11076237	No.
11076637	11077337	You haven't seen my Tron jacket?
11077357	11077898	No, it's not the hat.
11078945	11079546	Oh, you saw the hat?
11079646	11081827	They have four different jackets, too.
11082027	11083188	My jacket is awesome.
11083208	11085930	Didn't you see that picture of me on Facebook with the disc and everything?
11086751	11087672	Oh, forget it.
11088192	11091915	You need to go find it.
11092696	11094657	There's some awesome... There's a windbreaker.
11094737	11095398	There's a jacket.
11095438	11096218	There's a parka.
11096398	11100241	They're really expensive, though.
11101923	11102503	Well, okay.
11102603	11107647	I'm going to find that picture on Facebook of my jacket while you talk about whatever else you want to talk about tonight.
11108545	11114728	Oh, the other thing is I like Origin over Steam, I've decided.
11114988	11119049	So even though a lot of people have been slamming Origin, you are a fan of it.
11119089	11119510	Why is this?
11120750	11121911	I just think it looks cleaner.
11122971	11125372	It's easier to navigate, in my opinion.
11125412	11126993	I've been playing Mass Effect 2 on it.
11127173	11128173	It's prettier.
11130434	11130994	What was that?
11131454	11132395	It's prettier.
11133835	11134076	Yes.
11134496	11136316	And that's all that matters, usually, for me.
11137037	11137377	So...
11138157	11142979	because it's prettier and I can navigate it and I don't know.
11143159	11143980	I just like it better.
11144040	11151223	I wish more things were on it like VVVVVVV or if Portal loaded through it, that'd be cool, but no.
11152584	11152744	No.
11153985	11155365	It's not there, but I still like it better.
11157386	11158367	I sent you a link, by the way.
11159007	11160408	Are you at your computer or did you leave?
11161688	11162389	No, I left.
11162889	11166851	Oh, because I sent you a link to that picture of the jacket.
11168294	11169374	I don't want to go by my computer.
11169394	11171135	I don't want to see me get group kicked.
11171195	11172315	I've never been group kicked.
11172435	11174215	I think this is one of those times where I'm going to be group kicked.
11174235	11175756	I think it's really more that Steam's been around so long.
11175776	11176716	Everybody loves Steam.
11198542	11202065	and here's something new and nobody wants to try it because it's not Steam.
11202445	11209471	And so now that they're trying to pull, well, we want to put our own games only on our service, that's offensive to these people that like Steam only.
11211272	11217577	I mean, it's not like GameStop's freaking platform that sucks because it's GameStop and they're terrible.
11218218	11224503	It's just EA and they used to be terrible but Activision has that title now so we can be okay with EA.
11224743	11225884	People need to realize that.
11226713	11233256	Be sure that no one cared because it was just a Fable game, so it was overhyped and not worth the money.
11251314	11255856	Well, yeah, that and even the third-party games that they got licensed to sell on their store.
11256176	11257277	The library wasn't there.
11258077	11268222	So, like, ooh, you could buy Fable 3 or Arkham Asylum, which is a great game, but between the two, I'm not going to start giving them my money through their, you know, game platform.
11269003	11272244	So you think people need... The EA actually has good games sometimes.
11272844	11275946	You think people need to cut Origin a break and just check it out already?
11277116	11284304	Yeah, I mean, you don't have to get all upset because you were going to buy Battlefield on Steam.
11284324	11286907	No, well, you're not going to use your Steam client.
11286947	11290531	Big deal, you'll still get it anyway, and Origin's not that bad.
11292138	11319859	I'll install it and check it out it's pretty white and orange I just don't I don't like having like five different stores on my computer I already have the games for Windows thing which granted I don't even use it anymore well you can delete that I know I can delete that but that's I have Game Room believe it or not I bought Game Room stuff for my PC so I kind of have to keep it to play that but otherwise you know Steam but if Origin sells a crazy ass like $2 game sale if they have the sales like Steam does I will definitely I might have to do it yeah
11321680	11323121	Maybe they will.
11324982	11327664	You can have two things running, it's fine.
11327684	11329726	I have Steven and Origin running all the time.
11330386	11330746	Together.
11331006	11331547	They're friends.
11332908	11343895	I'm working on Pokemon right now too, so I'm trying to divide my time evenly between this one called Pokemon World of Warcraft.
11345771	11348914	I have a Pokemon question for me, Klitov.
11351096	11360324	If I were to buy one of these two things, and it was going to... Because I've never played Pokemon, so I'm... Okay, but you know, my God.
11361005	11364528	So leave right now the studio and go to... What time is it?
11364548	11366510	There's something that's got to be open that can sell you it.
11368571	11380621	between either Black and White or HeartGold and SoulSilver I have to pick one one of the two generations and that's going to be my definitive Pokemon experience which one do you think I should get?
11380741	11381242	Black and White?
11381862	11395574	Black and White I think it's amazing SoulSilver and HeartGold are pretty cool because you can get all the old starters and it's all nostalgic but if you haven't played them before you're not going to get nostalgic for that crap
11396329	11400991	and Black and White is just overall better made.
11401231	11403711	Like, they actually have the sprite set move.
11403811	11407133	It's very annoying playing one of those games and it's like, I do an attack.
11407233	11411354	Well, my guy is frozen, but he slightly moves forward because he tackled you.
11411374	11419597	And it's stupid, but at least he's like kind of wobble around and they have animations and I felt the story was kind of darker too, which was neat.
11421737	11424138	And plus, everything that comes out download-wise
11424617	11439533	is going to be for the newest ones and not for the old ones anymore so like you'd be stuck with no cool downloads, no special events, just plain old silver and gold but remade to be more fun than they used to be but
11440109	11440669	Not worth it.
11440949	11441570	Black and white are better.
11441590	11443030	Actdeft in our chatroom agrees.
11443410	11443910	Black or white.
11444391	11444651	What?
11444991	11446311	Actdeft in our chatroom agrees.
11446351	11447272	Get Pokemon black or white.
11447292	11452234	Because I just heard from Pokemon Phantom that Gen 2, which would be silver and gold, is like the best.
11452654	11454715	But I guess that's a lot of nostalgia talking.
11455055	11456495	So I'll pick up black or white.
11457856	11459296	Oh, which color are you going to get?
11460177	11460937	Oh, I don't know.
11461717	11464438	I still need to use that card for the evil store.
11464518	11465839	So I might pick up one of those.
11467039	11467460	It's like...
11469788	11471729	I want you to get Pokemon, but not in that way.
11471749	11475791	I feel really disgusted.
11476192	11480114	Fine, whatever.
11480714	11482035	Bye.
11485577	11487578	Hopefully he'll see that picture, too, and he'll be very hateful.
11487598	11488338	Let's get to another call.
11488358	11489119	There's more calls coming in.
11489399	11490319	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11490339	11490659	Who's this?
11491940	11492440	Hey, guys.
11492581	11493581	It's DDR Dalla Bill.
11493641	11494522	DDR Dalla Bill.
11494542	11495042	What's on your mind?
11496537	11497238	Not much.
11497298	11498699	First off, great show tonight.
11498839	11499179	Thank you.
11499199	11500340	A little long, but that's alright.
11500360	11500880	It's Labor Day.
11501621	11502221	That's cool.
11502461	11503422	It's much more fun that way.
11506084	11508426	Alright, I'll just make a sort of brief.
11509887	11513169	They had a sale this week at Best Buy where they were selling Child of Eden for $10.
11513749	11515831	Oh yeah, I heard about that.
11516771	11523236	Yeah, me and about three other co-workers were busy going to the Best Buy website
11523783	11529608	and trying our best to get our hands on the game because they were just being sold out or backordered everywhere.
11529628	11530669	It was just insane.
11531910	11533431	But I did pick up a copy eventually.
11535252	11540857	And I want to say I was impressed, but at the same time, I wasn't.
11542818	11544640	Well, let's break it down.
11544700	11546201	Let's start with the bad.
11546521	11548443	Why did you leave with a feeling of, meh?
11548583	11549564	Why weren't you impressed?
11550799	11555923	because I was trying with the Kinect controllers and waving my hands and it didn't feel responsive.
11557565	11558846	It really didn't feel responsive.
11559767	11560027	Right.
11560908	11569415	Like, I couldn't... The controllers confused me a bit because I couldn't tell, even from the tutorial, which was the lock-on, what was the auto-fire, what was this.
11569495	11571256	It was just bizarre.
11571376	11573518	Please tell me you tried the controller at some point, though.
11575099	11578502	Uh... Not yet, but only because I figured since...
11579673	11579973	and DarkSakura.
11604315	11608936	I mean, the opening visuals, although a little long, were very good.
11609136	11614917	I mean, I loved it, and I did love some of the backgrounds and graphics used, and the music was okay.
11615257	11621599	I didn't really pay attention to it, because it didn't seem to blend in, so I couldn't hear the music.
11621619	11623319	I was just too busy focusing on the screen.
11625220	11631521	I think the problem is that so many people were talking so much hype about it, I felt like I was going to get this game
11632065	11638007	and I was going to go outside and start touching people and healing them because I was getting the way that God powers something.
11638047	11641269	Like maybe the artsiness of the game was hyped up too much?
11642689	11645370	Yeah, which probably explains why I didn't like Braid so much.
11647331	11648311	Oh, I still love Braid.
11648351	11649112	It's a great game.
11649312	11655434	I mean, yeah, some people, like the people that like to smell their own farts are really into, oh, Braid is an experience.
11655474	11657415	But I just think Braid's a solid game.
11657835	11660156	For like a download title, it's just, it's fun.
11664110	11666111	The hype killed it.
11668272	11668972	The hype killed it.
11669092	11669833	The hype killed it.
11671173	11679397	Yes, and the ambiguous storyline sort of left me feeling... left me feeling a sense of blue balls.
11679757	11679897	Yeah.
11682270	11683550	What the hell just happened?
11683570	11684670	What did I just play?
11684910	11686571	Let's try to wrap on a positive note.
11686611	11688551	What did you enjoy on Child of Eden?
11689091	11691252	You said you were left with mixed feelings, so there was some good.
11691372	11692352	What was the good that you liked?
11693952	11710975	The fact that, like I said, after I got used to Kinect controls and used to the gameplay, I figured, okay, it's kind of like Rez, but a little easier because Rez at a few points got to be really insanely hard to the point of where you had to time everything precisely, otherwise it just didn't work.
11712338	11739371	so but Charlie just played a lot easier and it flowed a little better so you know I was okay with it I thought it was a good game I just didn't think it was God's gift to game but I thought it was a really good game though well and I think I think the best news of all is you only paid $10 for it most people paid $50 so yeah and the craziest part was the pre-owned was $35 uh that's a little backwards I know there you go I wonder how many people bought those just to sell them back to another store
11741047	11741648	Make some money.
11742610	11742910	All right.
11743731	11746055	DDR Dollar Bill, any other thoughts tonight?
11749701	11751904	I had them and they went out the window, unfortunately.
11752024	11752805	You got to write them down.
11752865	11753046	All right.
11753066	11754368	Send us an email then when you think of them.
11755598	11757999	Alright, take it easy guys Alright, have a good one buddy, take care Bye
11785265	11785465	Right?
11785505	11785786	Remember?
11785946	11786106	Yeah.
11786266	11786606	In person.
11786646	11788828	I mean, I knew you online, but it was the first time I met you in person.
11789049	11791911	Because I found Spike, and you were with Spike, I think.
11792252	11793913	No, I was with Frat Matt, actually.
11794193	11798197	Yeah, and I was like... But I've known him for a long time.
11798217	11804243	And we've been following each other on LiveJournal for years, and then right when we shook hands, the lights went down to go sit.
11804563	11805224	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11822541	11841714	and I don't remember what episode number it is I'm sure it's on the OLR wiki somewhere and it was a few years ago so it's back there it was in the episode 200 somewhere probably but it was great and check that out it was a long interview maybe somebody in chat will shout it out some of the OLR historians who know their wiki really well will
11843505	11853093	I had a really good time at Video Games Live, so I think it's worth seeing at least once in your life.
11853774	11854695	Do you agree, Alan?
11854875	11855756	Did you like Video Games Live?
11855836	11856556	Yeah.
11857177	11858438	Good stuff.
11859018	11859699	Let's go to the phones.
11859719	11860520	We're getting another call.
11860800	11861781	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11861801	11862141	Who's this?
11863042	11865104	Yo, it's Xenocore from the OKC.
11865124	11865764	How y'all doing?
11865824	11868106	Hello, OKC, Xenocore.
11868146	11868767	What is up, buddy?
11869522	11870442	Not much, not much.
11870502	11877465	I hope everybody's been paying attention to what the hell Good Old Games has been doing lately because I've been playing the hell out of my copy of Wing Commander 1 and 2.
11877925	11879926	I have not had the chance to bring this up.
11880106	11882507	I was thinking of it during the break and I forgot.
11882587	11883587	Thank you for reminding me.
11884108	11885548	I did play Good Old Games this week.
11885588	11886929	I finally made an account on there.
11886949	11890310	But do you know, it wasn't the Wing Commander thing that put me over the edge, although I think that's awesome.
11890890	11895072	It was the fact that they were giving away Ultima 4, Quest of the Avatar, for free.
11895732	11896352	Oh yeah, that's right.
11896433	11897513	I did hear about that one too.
11897673	11899154	God, I miss the Ultima series.
11899414	11900435	It was a great series.
11900455	11906159	I mean, yes, I realize there's still Ultima Online and all that stuff, but man, the Ultima series was a great series.
11906239	11911182	And you know they were going to make a tenth one a few years ago and it was a cancelled project?
11911782	11916305	Yeah, it was a full 3D engine and everything and I think it just got too big for what they were planning on.
11916645	11917566	Yeah, it's unfortunate.
11917686	11919347	But yes, I made a...
11919907	11943824	GOG account this week to get my copy of Ultima 4 even though I could probably download a copy on an abandoned aware site somewhere but what I love about good old games or at least so far that I've experienced is that they have the little DOS box thing fine tuned to work like I don't have to think about all these settings on how to emulate it just works and I like that I like that it just works
11944417	11953086	Yeah, it's worth the six bucks, especially with the Wing Commander packs, since you're getting both Wing Commander 1 and 2, and the secret missions, I think, for both 1 and 2.
11953247	11960815	And on top of that, they actually have what I think is the game development bible for Wing Commander 1 and 2, because it covers...
11961435	11967160	Every character, every facet of the game through Win Commander 1, Secret Operations, Win Commander 2, and 3.
11968240	11971403	So it's like, good lord, this is a 50 megabyte PDF file.
11971423	11972444	What the hell's in this thing?
11972924	11976287	And literally, it's like the resource document for game design.
11976327	11978048	So it's like, that's kind of cool.
11978909	11983612	And on top of my purchase of Crusader, Nora Morrison, it's like, I gotta give props to these guys.
11983632	11985654	They're finally getting the games I want to buy from them, so...
11987475	11991878	Good Old Games is... If you are like, why don't they make games like they used to?
11991938	11995620	Or you just want to play something from your youth that doesn't seem to work on the computer, check out Good Old Games.
11995680	11998202	I will say this, their library isn't vast right now.
11999002	12005046	One of the first games I went to go look up on Good Old Games, because I would have paid $10 for this game if I could find it.
12005106	12009469	It's a Sid Meier game that's not civilization, it's not even colonization.
12010229	12038310	and this is actually one of the games he in retrospect says it wasn't very good because they tried to be too ambitious with it but I disagree and it's covert action Sid Meier's Covert Action is like this James Bond-ish type of game and it's problem was that it was basically four separate games all thrown together but I love Covert Action and I was hoping it was on good old games but it's not not going to be sad but maybe soon I was hoping they'd pick up that one game Spycraft that they ran back in like the
12038650	12042412	Early 90s, that was all full motion video and stuff and all James Bond-esque.
12042712	12044073	Even had live torture in there.
12044093	12044754	It was kind of weird.
12046375	12053939	HitStun in our chat, by the way, is verifying it's still free right now as of the time we're recording and put a link in chat at GOG.com for Ultima 4 if you want to check it out.
12054759	12056600	Yeah, so everybody go get it now!
12057041	12057481	Go on!
12057601	12058261	Do it now!
12060343	12061343	Anyway, that's all I had.
12061423	12062704	Make sure you love your old games, guys.
12063466	12064327	Show your old game some love.
12064407	12065388	I think that was a great tip.
12065568	12069570	Thank you for bringing it up because I wanted to mention GOG, but I got sidetracked with all the Disney talk.
12070051	12071512	Well, here I am putting you back on, Shag.
12071880	12072100	All right.
12072120	12072640	Thank you very much.
12072680	12073200	I appreciate it.
12073341	12073781	Looking out for us.
12073801	12073981	All right.
12074001	12074301	Take care.
12074361	12074641	All right.
12075301	12076662	Bye.
12078062	12078542	All right.
12078882	12079282	Interesting.
12079302	12085424	We've had a lot of calls that are tonight kind of endorsing online services.
12085585	12086105	It's kind of neat.
12087085	12087325	Wow.
12087365	12089426	Some people in chat remember Covert Action.
12089466	12090166	I feel loved.
12090966	12092407	DDR Dollar Bill says, fuck yeah.
12092527	12094267	And Kai Judo says, Covert Action is the best.
12094327	12095248	I love that game.
12095388	12095888	Oh, my God.
12096748	12106972	Uh, Actdeft, by the way, also went in the wiki and found it was episode 285 from June 29th, 2008, had the Tommy Tallarico interview.
12107393	12110614	That would have been right around our 7th anniversary show.
12111374	12112635	It was probably the weekend before.
12113315	12114756	So, hmm, there you go, 285.
12116377	12121864	As to where you can find episode 285, come into chat.orange.com at some point.
12122505	12125509	And hell, I might have it still somewhere.
12126490	12129974	But I'm sure some folks like DarkTetsuya and so forth have the old episodes.
12130715	12132558	And it might even be on theolarchive.tk.
12133759	12146652	Our FTP server, thanks to the generosity of the web people that put it on, including VxJasonXV, who's just the man that helps our website have a place to be, upped our FTP some time ago.
12146712	12151136	So we haven't actually deleted anything from the FTP in like one or two years.
12151636	12154059	So it might still be on the FTP, I'm just not sure.
12155080	12155220	So...
12156281	12167288	One thing that I thought was funny about that Video Games Live performance we went to is that I feel that Bay Area geeks are kind of pretentious in how serious they take everything.
12168249	12175974	And that Video Games Live was where they debuted their orchestra performance of Time Scar.
12176194	12176875	Oh, Scar of Time.
12176915	12178275	Scar of Time from Chrono Cross.
12178556	12183059	And it was like a medley with the big song from Chrono Trigger.
12183499	12184780	And it was like the world premiere performance.
12185140	12205291	and everyone of course loved it but we were all so serious in the audience that like no one made a peep because it was such an awesome moment for those beautiful songs to be played but I think Tommy Tallarico was like like he didn't like it's like they're all just dead in the audience but we were just all in the moment everybody was just really into it like Bay Area people don't fuck around
12205791	12209836	Yeah, and he kept, for us to play this next song, everyone stand up and say, yeah!
12209896	12212278	And like, pump your fists and we're like, we don't do that here, bro.
12212358	12213119	We're very serious.
12214080	12216083	We don't hoot and holler in San Francisco.
12216203	12218085	We're serious business.
12218666	12220628	I think that kind of went against his personality.
12221248	12224651	But also, Tommy does great things.
12224671	12225692	I'm not slamming what he does.
12225792	12232958	But I think to do that fist pump for Chrono Cross, you fist pump for Halo.
12233038	12235940	You fist pump for those other types of high energy games.
12236360	12240323	I'm not saying that Chrono Cross is a boring game or whatever, but it's just role playing games are a little different.
12240363	12241304	It's art, damn it.
12241364	12242385	Yes, thank you.
12242425	12243146	It's art, damn it.
12244474	12249118	Alright, there's hella people in our chatroom that are like, fuck yeah, free Ultima 4.
12249559	12251921	I will say this, I had Ultima 4 on the NES.
12252601	12253302	It was so good.
12254363	12257405	Like, it's hard as fuck, but it is good.
12257766	12258346	It's a good game.
12258727	12259948	Alright, anyhow, back to tweets.
12259988	12261449	We keep getting derailed from tweets tonight.
12262690	12264472	Let's see, going to Redertainment.
12264812	12268835	Which game coming out holiday do you think will be the biggest bust?
12269856	12274039	I think Skyrim will disappoint, but Uncharted 3 will sell poorly.
12274539	12275660	Ooh, that's an interesting question.
12275740	12279483	Redertainment says, which game do you think will be the biggest bust this holiday?
12279963	12280844	I actually disagree.
12280964	12284686	I think Skyrim's gonna do awesome, but that's total fanboy in me.
12285327	12285767	What do you think?
12285847	12286808	Loki, you're grinning over there.
12287088	12288269	What game do you think will be a bust?
12290070	12290930	Skylanders!
12291150	12292692	I fucking hate Skylanders.
12292752	12293652	I hope it burns.
12294032	12297735	Oh, is that the game with the pets and stuff?
12298439	12301122	It's a game from Activision starring Spyro.
12301182	12302944	Skylanders, Spyro's Adventure.
12302984	12303625	Fuck that game.
12303665	12304826	Yes, you ranted about this before.
12305387	12305928	Burns and Fire.
12308570	12313236	See, I would have said Star Wars Connect, but they already bumped it to 2012.
12314697	12316779	So now I'm in a predicament.
12316839	12318800	What do I say is going to disappoint this holiday?
12318900	12319260	I don't know.
12319300	12322203	I feel like everything that might have disappointed got bumped to Christmas.
12322263	12325545	I don't think I can say the 3DS because it's no longer got the Vita to compete with.
12325645	12329268	Well, I could say one, but it's probably just a no-brainer, Silent Hill.
12330548	12333751	Yeah, but I don't even consider that a big title with high expectations.
12335312	12336012	I don't know.
12336192	12338394	I don't know what would possibly disappoint.
12343037	12343978	GoldenEye Reloaded?
12344944	12346745	Somebody's going to really hate me for saying this.
12347146	12358494	I think the game will be great, but Dance Central 2, I don't think it's going to be quite as huge of a deal as the first one, and it's because the market has been saturated.
12359055	12360736	Because now you have the Just Dance and so forth.
12360836	12362637	I hope it doesn't, but I don't know.
12362677	12367020	There's this weird part of me that's kind of like, I don't think it's going to make waves like the first one did.
12367100	12367721	I hope I'm wrong.
12368041	12372304	I hope I'm wrong, because I really like those games, but I just think the market's going to be very saturated.
12374306	12375406	Night of the Old Republic MMO
12392635	12394458	Now this isn't the solution I was looking for.
12395400	12397844	That's a clever response.
12397904	12398404	I like that.
12399646	12399927	All right.
12400628	12403152	Anyhow, moving on to other tweets.
12403633	12405776	Spazernator sends us some very interesting tweets.
12406673	12407893	Well, it finally happened.
12408333	12409794	I have become an ex-bot.
12410214	12410914	Fuck Sony.
12411034	12413595	I'll pirate their shit before I buy any of their stuff again.
12414015	12415475	Sorry I won't be in chat.
12415775	12416755	Personal stuff going on.
12417956	12427938	Now, if you've been listening to Orange Launch Radio for the past, I don't know, couple years, Spazinator calls in pretty reliably once a month, if not a little more often than that, and talks about the latest going on on PSN, especially the video marketplace.
12427978	12432039	But he's also run into some major issues when it comes to, he's had like three of them break down on him.
12432879	12458250	so I'm very curious to see what sent him over the edge like was it one more breakdown was it one bad customer service call like I've gotta know like what fucking just cause I would not see those tweets coming from Spazinator like what fucking broke him like I've gotta know I've gotta know right yeah and he had problems where he would buy games and then he would get a new console but they wouldn't unlock his games for him yeah he had a lot of problems with them I don't know
12459335	12479726	so PodCulture sent us a tweet that says hello from DragonCon so we want to say hello right back to PodCulture sorry you and Bobby couldn't get on the show tonight we had a late start live we miss you guys and congrats on your Parsec award that you won for your podcast the TARDIS Interruptus the name escaped me for a minute there but thank you the Doctor Who podcast
12481106	12482808	Moving on to some tweets from Tigerclaw.
12483329	12484189	A couple tweets here.
12484450	12485791	I read this right before the show.
12485831	12486832	This is fascinating to me.
12486952	12490415	League of Legends shutting down Mac support, tweets Tigerclaw.
12490455	12496661	A story that after a year of beta testing, Riot Games is just canceling Mac OS support for League of Legends.
12496701	12498303	It will be ending at midnight on Tuesday.
12499224	12506032	They have said quote our current approach regarding the Mac platform won't guarantee the quality and frequent updates we deliver today on the PC.
12507013	12509516	They're not ruling out a Mac version in the future.
12509796	12513861	They say they are committed to building a solution that will work on the Mac in the long run but it will take some time.
12514261	12516802	The shutdown will be effective midnight on September 6th.
12517242	12525684	Now, the beta testers who used League of Legends, they can either get a full refund if they use the store, or they can keep their accounts open and play on a PC.
12526204	12528745	All the Mac players will get a code for a champion pack.
12529085	12532686	A Mac player means that the majority of the logins came from the Mac client.
12532966	12535087	Those have to also be redeemed before Tuesday.
12535507	12538748	So if you're a Mac player, League of Legends, go get your free ship before they shut it down.
12539488	12539668	Right?
12539728	12540968	Pretty much is what it is.
12542769	12543369	That's a bummer.
12545261	12546862	Let's see, also another tweet here.
12547462	12549982	He sent us a tweet about that whole Comcast story.
12550322	12562825	It's not directly related to games, but did you hear about how Comcast, in a nutshell, Hurricane Irene happened and shut down the power, and Comcast won't refund people for it because they say, eh, it's an act of God.
12563826	12564826	What if you don't believe in God?
12568393	12570994	Tricky... No, you're right.
12571074	12571575	It could be.
12571695	12572055	I don't know.
12572315	12573055	I'm sorry.
12573075	12574356	I don't believe in God.
12574536	12576137	They consider a hurricane part of that.
12576417	12577598	But here's the thing.
12577658	12579419	Why don't they just call it Active Nature?
12580319	12581019	You can't dispute.
12581279	12581920	It is nature.
12582740	12583120	Whatever.
12583180	12586582	I'm not going to get into that because it's way too controversial for our little video game show.
12587062	12588303	However, I will say this.
12589404	12591445	It's not that I'm siding with Comcast in this.
12591525	12595226	I kind of just think you should do the Goodwill thing and it was a pretty big event.
12595266	12597948	You should just chip in the extra couple days of internet and suck it up.
12598588	12606991	But, I mean, you guys, you guys, power outages are gonna happen, and, like, you will be without cable TV, and, you know, it's just gonna happen.
12607011	12613853	I understand that, but they're, you know, the power company doesn't charge me for power that I'm using when there's no power.
12616094	12616734	And you know what?
12616814	12621216	Comcast could easily fucking bury their goddamn lines in the ground, we wouldn't have any of this problem.
12624209	12647164	I do think they should just suck it up and do it out of goodwill but I also at the same time I'm just saying you know what these are risks you take and I kind of think it's justified a little bit I think it's bad at customer relations but it's not a legal business decision I just think it's not going to keep people in their good graces that's all
12650383	12662311	When I worked at Pac Bell and we had a two or three day outage of DSL broadband in a certain area or just like our email service went down for a couple days, we would say, okay, you're paying 20 bucks a month.
12662651	12663571	It was down for three days.
12663952	12667314	I have supervisor approval to refund you for seven cents.
12668234	12670976	And of course, the customer would go completely batshit.
12671437	12672497	But it's like this.
12672737	12676520	It's in our terms and conditions that we have outages.
12676540	12676760	Yeah.
12677621	12679022	and you're agreeing to deal with that.
12681525	12687411	Sorry, it's probably not the popular response you were hoping from us angry people at OLR, but you have to kind of look at both sides of it.
12688252	12692697	I'm just happy that the hurricane didn't end up being as horrific as they thought.
12692777	12697943	I mean, yes, I understand Vermont flooded and some people were in bad situations and that really sucks.
12698363	12703567	However, I'm glad it wasn't as terrible as they were saying in the beginning, right?
12704288	12705689	Like we were thinking it was going to be even worse.
12705909	12708171	So I'm just really glad it wasn't even worse.
12709272	12712294	Anyhow, one more tweet from Tigerclaw.
12712655	12719240	And this is interesting because it's about... I didn't hear about this for the show tonight, but I guess there is an Uncharted 3 trailer that is out.
12719760	12722282	And it is a Portuguese trailer.
12722923	12724964	And they did a version of it that I guess...
12726064	12736071	I guess the way they translated the trailer or whatever and the way the voices sound and so forth isn't going over very well in Brazil.
12736571	12742715	And they're going to Naughty Dog's forums to just basically yell at people and say that you don't even know what the hell you're doing, basically.
12742755	12747098	It's kind of like, you know when you get a really bad English dub here?
12747538	12750460	Like, come on, who didn't see one of those videos for Heavy Rain?
12750560	12751100	Jason!
12751741	12752301	Jason!
12752381	12755123	Like, you know, and it was very obviously French people doing English accents.
12755943	12772848	It's kind of like that similar thing, but we take a lot of that for granted because if it's English, between that and Japanese, the two languages used in most games, we just take for granted that the other languages probably sound alright too, and this is a case where it doesn't.
12775509	12775889	There you go.
12776792	12779794	All right, and a couple more tweets here.
12780855	12784237	DarkDetsuya tweeted us and said, Here's confirmation.
12784677	12787779	The Anaheim move for WonderCon was confirmed.
12787919	12789800	There will not be WonderCon in San Francisco next year.
12789820	12791661	It's in Anaheim.
12791941	12797405	Moscone Center is being completely, like that wing of it is being shut down for renovations.
12798025	12799946	So the weekend that they would want to have it.
12800447	12800927	No choice.
12801307	12801567	Yeah.
12801828	12802148	No choice.
12803108	12826579	and lastly tonight Shadley Lund tweets us saying forgot to mention on the phone Dance Central 2 crews are awesome and it sounds like they have big plans for them reminds me of Bust a Groove, Bust a Move now those were good fucking games I just saw a little gameplay clip of one of those games the other night and I was like god I miss those games Bust a Move as it's more properly called had a third game for the PS2
12827219	12831181	Oh god, it had that wacky controller.
12831321	12831902	Shane has it.
12831942	12832302	He brought it.
12832642	12834243	Dance Summit is what it was called.
12835304	12837045	I completely missed it.
12837725	12839146	I didn't even hear about it until last year.
12839531	12846294	So, we are running so late tonight that the press event for Dragon Quest X has started.
12847835	12850256	It's now 10 o'clock on the West Coast, 1 p.m.
12850296	12852357	This has been a long fucking show tonight.
12852377	12854077	I'm going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
12854097	12854998	It wasn't ringing anyway.
12855038	12856639	I think we got everybody they wanted to get through.
12856999	12859680	I will ask Loki real quick, though, if there's any last-minute stories tonight.
