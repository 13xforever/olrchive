WEBVTT

00:14.438 --> 00:15.439
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't listen to this part.

00:15.539 --> 00:16.139
[SPEAKER_03]: It's lies.

00:16.179 --> 00:16.760
[SPEAKER_03]: It was last week.

00:16.780 --> 00:19.561
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo reveals the future of the 3DS and it's pink.

00:19.942 --> 00:22.643
[SPEAKER_03]: The PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch.

00:23.003 --> 00:26.866
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sony adds a controversial new section to the PSN Terms of Service.

00:27.746 --> 00:30.868
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

00:32.289 --> 00:38.293
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello and welcome to episode 429 of this derpisode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.993 --> 00:43.756
[SPEAKER_06]: I am your hostess of the evening, DarkSakura, and with me always is our techmaster, Loki.

00:44.862 --> 00:53.784
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this is take two because someone was forgetting to start recording because someone's very jealous that Rob's off seeing Lady Tron tonight in San Francisco.

00:55.685 --> 00:57.025
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, what are we?

00:58.085 --> 01:05.567
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice, be it digitized or if we're saying it for you or whatever.

01:06.349 --> 01:19.663
[SPEAKER_06]: So over the next few hours we will be talking about game stuff and we tape live every week on allgamesradio.com and that starts at 6 o'clock pacific time right after the Bobby Blackwell show and if you're listening to us live get in our chat room.

01:20.123 --> 01:24.167
[SPEAKER_06]: It's chat.orangeradio.com and we are on Game Surge server.

01:24.948 --> 01:26.950
[SPEAKER_06]: So Loki, again, how was Earth Defense Force?

01:27.506 --> 01:28.387
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

01:46.338 --> 01:49.500
[SPEAKER_07]: But thankfully you do get up to six players, which is kind of cool.

01:50.160 --> 01:54.362
[SPEAKER_07]: Although we didn't get to play very long because our internet connection at work is kind of sketchy.

01:54.403 --> 01:56.263
[SPEAKER_07]: It drops us every now and then.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.585
[SPEAKER_07]: More often than every now and then.

02:00.766 --> 02:01.646
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty often, actually.

02:03.127 --> 02:06.648
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then, you know, Grand Theft Auto is the usual Grand Theft Auto stuff.

02:06.948 --> 02:09.649
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, still trying to keep my winning streak going.

02:10.489 --> 02:13.210
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, what else did I try?

02:14.010 --> 02:20.832
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, it wasn't really game related, but I did mess around with the, um, Xbox Marketplace a little bit.

02:21.132 --> 02:24.152
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, watched, my wife wanted to watch an episode of Up All Night.

02:24.532 --> 02:27.913
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, so we watched that real quick and actually worked out pretty good.

02:27.953 --> 02:30.394
[SPEAKER_07]: Never really used the Zoom Marketplace before, so that's kind of neat.

02:31.495 --> 02:37.759
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also got to check out, well, I browsed and buy, some of the Xbox Live Indie games.

02:37.779 --> 02:39.200
[SPEAKER_07]: And man, there's some weird shit on there.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.821
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know.

02:41.942 --> 02:44.303
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a game I saw that was about prank calling people.

02:44.403 --> 02:48.746
[SPEAKER_07]: There was The Babymaker Extreme 2, I know, and we've talked about that before.

02:49.647 --> 02:50.307
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks hilarious.

02:50.687 --> 02:52.248
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't pick it up, though, but...

02:53.209 --> 03:22.448
[SPEAKER_07]: just a lot of stuff that's on there that's not great but it is kind of hard to navigate everything so hopefully they fix that and maybe with one of these updates maybe the next fall dashboard update will fix the store a little bit so it's easier to find stuff I think that's really all that I've played maybe a little bit more Zelda I don't remember if I actually played that or not this week but yeah that's about it I played WoW that's it

03:24.042 --> 03:25.223
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're consistent.

03:49.855 --> 03:50.835
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

04:09.602 --> 04:17.345
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, the Old Republic will be shipping on December 20th and of course they do have some details on what it's going to cost you.

04:17.785 --> 04:20.306
[SPEAKER_07]: They have different subscription packages.

04:20.386 --> 04:21.786
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go month to month which is $14.99.

04:22.226 --> 04:28.809
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course each game does come with a 30 day subscription that runs out and after 30 days you have to pay for it.

04:30.489 --> 04:52.454
[SPEAKER_07]: if you choose to pay for some of your months in a lump sum you will save a little bit of money 3 months at a time will break it down to $13.99 a month and then 6 months at a time $12.99 a month so if you're dedicated to playing this game for a long time maybe the lump sums are the way to go you know what?

04:52.834 --> 04:59.536
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the opportunity to get a lifetime membership for Star Trek Online and now I'm very glad I didn't because it's going free to play yeah

05:01.130 --> 05:02.651
[SPEAKER_06]: I would advise everyone to hold off.

05:03.212 --> 05:11.099
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, lifetime memberships, yeah, you might hold off on that because you never know the life cycle of these games nowadays that a lot of them are going free to play, but six months isn't bad.

05:11.460 --> 05:13.942
[SPEAKER_07]: I imagine that Star Wars game is going to be around for at least six months.

05:14.850 --> 05:17.031
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, who knows?

05:17.271 --> 05:24.714
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I quit playing, well, no, that was February of, no, I started playing in February.

05:24.734 --> 05:26.374
[SPEAKER_06]: I quit actually a year ago.

05:27.515 --> 05:28.735
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek Online, this month.

05:29.295 --> 05:29.555
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

05:30.456 --> 05:31.276
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, in two months, sorry.

05:31.316 --> 05:36.718
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, but yeah, I'd say though, six months is fine, but if they offer any type of lifetime thing, don't do it.

05:37.018 --> 05:37.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do it.

05:39.099 --> 05:40.959
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even if they give you a lightsaber that works.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe that's worth it.

05:44.622 --> 05:51.245
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in other news, we have something about Sega of Europe.

05:51.545 --> 05:54.666
[SPEAKER_06]: John Smedley is saying they're a free-to-play model for DC.

05:54.706 --> 05:55.086
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony.

05:55.386 --> 05:55.686
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.007
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony Entertainment.

05:57.447 --> 05:58.328
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I said Sony.

05:58.388 --> 05:59.088
[SPEAKER_07]: Online Entertainment.

05:59.748 --> 06:00.148
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

06:01.169 --> 06:01.689
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm derp.

06:03.049 --> 06:03.950
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still mad at Rob.

06:04.170 --> 06:04.830
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still mad at Rob.

06:05.711 --> 06:06.651
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really mad at Rob.

06:08.031 --> 06:08.332
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

06:09.672 --> 06:14.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony Online Entertainment has a free-to-play model for DC Universe Online.

06:15.749 --> 06:18.711
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be three membership levels.

06:18.731 --> 06:20.453
[SPEAKER_06]: There's free, premium, and legendary.

06:21.273 --> 06:26.997
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have full access to the game that has different levels of flexibility.

06:27.438 --> 06:35.804
[SPEAKER_06]: So free players will have two character slots, and you downloadable game packs and updates, additional character slots you can pay for them.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.066
[SPEAKER_06]: I refuse to use the term microtransaction.

06:38.926 --> 06:42.048
[SPEAKER_06]: Premium, so that's going to be people who have spent at least $5 on the game.

06:42.708 --> 06:45.909
[SPEAKER_06]: That's including former subscribers and in-game item purchasers.

06:45.969 --> 06:49.031
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have additional character slots, inventory slots, and higher cash limits.

06:49.691 --> 06:53.132
[SPEAKER_06]: Legendary will have the maximum, including free DLC.

06:53.773 --> 06:57.775
[SPEAKER_06]: More than 15 character slots and more than 80 inventory slots for $15 a month.

06:59.535 --> 07:02.397
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is happening really soon, as in next week.

07:02.637 --> 07:02.877
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

07:04.077 --> 07:05.198
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means I can play the game.

07:05.868 --> 07:08.091
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I will be trying it out, but honestly I'm glad I didn't pay for it.

07:24.625 --> 07:28.028
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think a lot of these MMOs should go free-to-play.

07:28.568 --> 07:32.311
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you, if Final Fantasy XI ever goes free-to-play, God, I don't know.

07:32.972 --> 07:34.152
[SPEAKER_07]: I may have to get back into that.

07:35.954 --> 07:37.355
[SPEAKER_06]: Nelly will wonder what happened to you.

07:37.655 --> 07:50.245
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, it's not that big of a deal, because really the whole thing is I couldn't see myself paying, I think it was $13 a month or something like that for Final Fantasy XI, but I was only playing it maybe one evening a month.

07:51.746 --> 07:52.567
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't see myself...

07:53.087 --> 07:54.448
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

08:11.094 --> 08:20.122
[SPEAKER_07]: Some more information going along the lines with, it's not really an MMO, but maybe the reason why the Old Republic did announce to be shipping this year.

08:20.502 --> 08:22.323
[SPEAKER_07]: Diablo 3 is actually going to launch early 2012.

08:22.764 --> 08:24.946
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to make it out this year, unfortunately.

08:26.387 --> 08:33.894
[SPEAKER_07]: They did mention that they're going to extend the beta period, of course, since obviously the game's going to be coming out later on.

08:33.934 --> 08:34.134
[SPEAKER_07]: They have

08:34.574 --> 08:38.055
[SPEAKER_07]: More time to test it and hopefully get any kinks out of it.

08:39.195 --> 08:46.557
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they're saying, while the news may not be a complete surprise, I know many of you were hopeful that Diablo 3 would ship this year.

08:47.177 --> 08:48.477
[SPEAKER_07]: We were too.

08:49.157 --> 08:57.419
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, ultimately, we felt to deliver an awesome Diablo sequel that lives up to our expectations and yours as well.

08:57.779 --> 09:01.200
[SPEAKER_07]: We should take a little more time to add further polish to a few different elements of the game.

09:01.460 --> 09:03.382
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in other words, it was buggy and they needed to fix it.

09:03.522 --> 09:05.004
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's fine.

09:05.204 --> 09:05.864
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is new?

09:07.086 --> 09:08.607
[SPEAKER_07]: There's too much stuff coming out this year, anyway.

09:09.408 --> 09:22.360
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've just... They actually were starting to put out little warnings on World of Warcraft, by the way, that if someone messages you saying, oh, you've got the Diablo 3 pass here, give us your password, blah, blah, blah.

09:22.401 --> 09:24.503
[SPEAKER_06]: If you give anyone your password, you're stupid.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.604
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

09:25.624 --> 09:25.864
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

09:27.728 --> 09:30.952
[SPEAKER_06]: Diablo III Diablo III Diablo III Diablo III

09:46.360 --> 10:02.741
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever well anyway so let's move forward into other news shall we shall speaking of Blizzard they are talking about patch 4.3 which everyone has been all abuzz about in game you know we get transmogrifying that means you can make your new shit look like old shit

10:03.522 --> 10:04.803
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:23.888 --> 10:24.488
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?

10:24.528 --> 10:30.230
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, in the Firelands, the first boss has a dog with him named Rageface, but everyone calls him Rapeface.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.931
[SPEAKER_06]: His attack is called Face Rage.

10:34.811 --> 10:35.791
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just call it Face Rape.

10:36.251 --> 10:36.591
That's awesome.

10:36.871 --> 10:37.071
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

10:38.392 --> 10:41.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Deathwing's just not sitting around.

10:41.813 --> 10:47.754
[SPEAKER_06]: Because before, all he was doing was showing up in areas and burning people to death if they were on the ground and not in the air.

10:48.694 --> 10:50.875
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me, it took forever to get that stupid achievement.

10:51.810 --> 10:54.693
[SPEAKER_06]: So, he's going to be a raid.

10:54.713 --> 11:00.379
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually have to go into the future, go into the past, and the whole thing is going to end on the dragon's back.

11:00.539 --> 11:06.726
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you have to pull off pieces of his plate armor as he's spinning down into the maelstrom.

11:07.847 --> 11:11.471
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, get all stabby on him and maybe try to kill him.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.873
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least, you know, make him really pissed off at you.

11:15.999 --> 11:19.705
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be really, really huge.

11:20.046 --> 11:27.237
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was reading some of the technical development behind it and they said that they've had to really pull some technical strings to get it to work.

11:28.298 --> 11:30.983
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to seeing it, although honestly right now it's going to be forever.

11:31.483 --> 11:31.964
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

11:48.264 --> 11:48.604
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's it.

11:48.624 --> 11:48.684
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

12:15.572 --> 12:36.967
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course, like I said, the Deathwing Smackdown This is kind of interesting, there was a story on Rock Paper Shocking this week Talking about, you know how there's a lot of these folding projects The folding at home is a really popular one Well there was one, I guess it was a little bit newer, called Foldit

12:37.747 --> 12:45.774
[SPEAKER_07]: And what Foldit is, is it's not just, you know, folding with your actual system or PC or whatever that you're using.

12:46.114 --> 12:48.916
[SPEAKER_07]: It does require some human interaction as well.

12:49.016 --> 12:52.819
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of use, think of it like mind folding, I guess.

12:54.020 --> 13:01.646
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, they were using this to kind of figure out how viruses like the AIDS virus worked and stuff like that.

13:02.487 --> 13:05.109
[SPEAKER_07]: Also cancer and Alzheimer's as well.

13:05.849 --> 13:32.130
[SPEAKER_07]: and I guess these are related to proteins and what the project does is I guess basically it's spatial recognition or something where players will I'm not really sure what you do but apparently it has something to do with matching stuff and based on your results and what they have in here they have I guess figured out how these actually work now so

13:33.191 --> 13:33.812
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

13:50.927 --> 14:03.099
[SPEAKER_07]: Foldit players leverage human three-dimensional problem-solving skills to interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction mythology.

14:03.900 --> 14:12.868
[SPEAKER_07]: Players collaborate with teammates while competing with other players to obtain the highest score, lowest energy models, and proof-of-concept tests.

14:13.208 --> 14:14.570
[SPEAKER_07]: Foldit players most of

14:15.231 --> 14:30.088
[SPEAKER_07]: who have little or no background in biochemistry were able to solve protein structure refinement problems in which backbone rearrangement was necessary to correctly bury hydrophobic residues.

14:31.069 --> 14:34.593
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we report folded player successes in real world...

14:35.354 --> 14:45.838
[SPEAKER_07]: Real-world modeling problems with complex deviations from native structures leading to the solution of a long-standing protein crystal structure problem.

14:46.658 --> 14:54.200
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said basically, yeah, this is going to possibly lead to a cure for this stuff.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.441
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty amazing.

14:56.943 --> 15:02.365
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems to me like in some cases education might get in the way of intuition, don't you think?

15:02.985 --> 15:03.245
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

15:03.585 --> 15:10.608
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people have a natural aptitude towards solving puzzles as long as you give it to them in a term that they're going to understand it.

15:13.725 --> 15:29.877
[SPEAKER_07]: The critical role of folded players in the solution of the M-PMV PR structure shows the power of online games to channel human intuition and three-dimensional pattern matching skills to solve challenging scientific problems.

15:30.337 --> 15:42.223
[SPEAKER_07]: Although much attention has been recently given to the potential of crowdsourcing and game playing, this is the first instance that we are aware of in which online players solve the long-standing scientific problem.

15:42.283 --> 15:48.065
[SPEAKER_07]: These results indicate potential for integrating video games into real-world scientific process.

15:48.886 --> 15:57.570
[SPEAKER_07]: The ingenuity of the game players is formidable force that, if properly directed, can be used to solve a wide range of scientific problems.

15:57.950 --> 16:06.274
[SPEAKER_07]: So you never know, they may be just using this for other diseases, obviously potentials unlimited, new forms of energy, who knows?

16:06.494 --> 16:13.317
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was reading before that they had broken, what was it, one of the HIV virus models, right?

16:13.378 --> 16:14.458
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is what that's about.

16:15.018 --> 16:22.182
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, think if they've come to that, this could be applied towards cancers, tumors, just about anything.

16:23.562 --> 16:27.324
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is a good way to get new resources.

16:27.344 --> 16:33.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Because any type of research, if it hits a dead end, it's going to need a fresh pair of eyes and a fresh brain to go with it.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.868
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Foldit thing hasn't even been around that long.

16:35.948 --> 16:44.171
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically 236,000 players, which as far as compared to Folding the Home, I think that's a lot less than what they've got.

16:44.632 --> 16:45.272
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, I guess...

16:46.012 --> 17:06.558
[SPEAKER_07]: That they've been working together the last three years And it only took them ten days to unravel that actual scientific problem there So that one alone, ten days with that many people Can you imagine if they just integrated this into all the places that the folding at home stuff is?

17:07.258 --> 17:13.020
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be pretty powerful And another thing too, this actually says a lot for the spirit of cooperation

17:14.985 --> 17:39.736
[SPEAKER_06]: this is a lot of even though they have it set up as a competition in the end it's a lot of people working together and they're getting results by people having a common goal and working towards it and I think that we could all stand to learn something from that yeah cool so moving forward man that's actually super cool though I mean I'm still kind of whenever I try to think about the possibilities for that it actually makes my brain hurt a little bit

17:40.851 --> 17:47.176
[SPEAKER_06]: So, how about something that won't make my brain hurt that much, because honestly, it's not surprising.

17:47.656 --> 17:51.339
[SPEAKER_06]: 28% of 3DS users do not like the 3D feature.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.901
[SPEAKER_06]: They say it detracts from their games.

17:55.162 --> 18:08.593
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a study done out by the research firm Interpret LLC that said 22% of those thought the 3D improved gameplay, but 13% were so put off by the effect that they turned it off altogether.

18:09.914 --> 18:22.063
[SPEAKER_06]: 56% also found that their ideal 3D gaming experience was a 3D capable console connected to a TV with only 7% giving a nod towards the 3DS.

18:23.843 --> 18:25.764
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think right now it's still really early.

18:26.044 --> 18:30.465
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just, I think a lot of games aren't using it correctly.

18:31.345 --> 18:34.246
[SPEAKER_07]: And even this, I mean, goes to Nintendo.

18:34.386 --> 18:42.709
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, some of their design choices in games are really stupid, especially like with Star Fox where they have the tilt controls and then the 3D.

18:42.749 --> 18:43.369
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't work.

18:43.829 --> 18:52.595
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to break the 3D because your 3D method requires people to basically have a certain perspective that you view the screen at.

18:52.915 --> 18:57.618
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're turning and tilting the screen around, it's going to break that and it's going to turn it 2D anyways.

18:58.159 --> 19:03.502
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, you could turn the 3D off and play with the tilt controls or turn it on and play with it without tilt controls.

19:03.642 --> 19:13.369
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, to fully utilize the game, it's kind of impossible the way that they have it, I guess, unless you're supposed to tilt your whole body with that, which is kind of stupid.

19:14.250 --> 19:17.793
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but yeah, 3D consoles, I think, is definitely the way to go.

19:18.154 --> 19:23.359
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you noticed, though, that some people, when they play a game that requires turning and things, that they'll lean with their controller?

19:24.821 --> 19:25.902
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, when you're five.

19:26.122 --> 19:27.824
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't think anyone does that anymore.

19:28.244 --> 19:29.245
[SPEAKER_06]: I do if I really get into it.

19:29.285 --> 19:34.050
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, when I was playing Katamari, though, I'd get motion sick, so I'd actually follow the direction of the TV to keep from getting motion sick.

19:34.431 --> 19:35.392
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I see.

19:35.412 --> 19:35.432
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

19:36.818 --> 19:38.120
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need my little pony in 3D

19:52.344 --> 19:53.266
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

19:53.947 --> 20:02.459
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really... The only time I ever see that nowadays is when they have a stupid PR shot of people playing a video game and they're so excited!

20:02.499 --> 20:05.624
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so psyched to be playing the game and they're just really getting into it.

20:06.305 --> 20:07.988
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, it's just...

20:09.480 --> 20:09.720
[SPEAKER_07]: 3D Glasses

20:27.659 --> 20:28.279
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

20:49.415 --> 20:50.316
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the one with Blu-ray?

20:50.416 --> 20:53.519
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he didn't know because he's busy fucking making money and working.

20:54.380 --> 21:03.850
[SPEAKER_07]: He hasn't had time to game and that kind of stuff, but there's a lot of people out there that aren't really into games and aren't really aware of

21:05.467 --> 21:06.087
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21:25.818 --> 21:44.070
[SPEAKER_07]: so there's going to be a lot of awareness going into the fourth quarter about the 3DS 3D stuff for the Playstation a little bit I think no whatsoever mention for the 3D stuff that they have on the 360 because there are a lot of games that do support 3D on the Xbox 360 but

21:47.432 --> 22:03.209
[SPEAKER_07]: but there's no mention of that because first party wise they don't really well actually I guess Gears 3 did but first party wise they don't really support 3D too much it's mainly just the third parties the cross platform stuff like you know Batman Arkham Asylum or

22:03.809 --> 22:06.050
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, actually, Arkham Asylum had 3D support.

22:06.911 --> 22:14.075
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the stereoscopic shutter glasses 3D, but the red cyan glasses.

22:14.155 --> 22:19.519
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they also have... But Arkham City does have 3D support, and there's some other games that do support 3D.

22:20.059 --> 22:24.902
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not really advertised widely, I guess.

22:28.044 --> 22:28.204
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

22:30.808 --> 22:40.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what, now I'm trying to picture playing through, not like the old school Cyan Magenta, like the newer ones, right?

22:41.246 --> 22:43.029
[SPEAKER_06]: That you don't really see Cyan and Magenta anymore.

22:44.224 --> 23:01.729
[SPEAKER_07]: I've honestly I haven't used those types of glasses in a long time and I still think that all I see is cyan and magenta and that stuff I mean it would be awesome if they had some sort of glasses like that that I didn't see that but I've never I haven't seen anything like that recently that doesn't affect the color

23:02.887 --> 23:04.249
[SPEAKER_06]: Release dates Release dates

23:19.208 --> 23:23.414
[SPEAKER_07]: The US is still going to have a lot of stuff coming out this week.

23:24.416 --> 23:27.059
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, because we're in the fourth quarter, technically.

23:27.680 --> 23:34.470
[SPEAKER_07]: So, starting things off, we've got FIFA Soccer 12 on the Wii coming out a little bit later than the rest of the platforms.

23:35.530 --> 23:36.971
[SPEAKER_07]: Some re-releases from THQ.

23:38.552 --> 23:40.433
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just some of their old party games.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.735
[SPEAKER_07]: And a Game Show Fun pack, which is Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy.

23:44.055 --> 23:46.476
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on the Wii.

23:46.576 --> 23:48.977
[SPEAKER_07]: Gunslinger from Valcon.

[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing on the Vita yet.

27:38.300 --> 27:40.001

[SPEAKER_07]: That's coming out as well, regular and limited edition.

[SPEAKER_07]: Holy crap, there's a ton of stuff.

28:59.763 --> 29:03.026
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Neon Genesis, Evangelion, Third Impact.

29:03.086 --> 29:09.572
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming that's maybe a localized version, an Asian version or something like that.

29:10.593 --> 29:16.699
[SPEAKER_07]: Secret Game Portable, Yeti Best, that's coming out as well.

29:18.601 --> 29:19.542
[SPEAKER_07]: They're even doing a...

29:21.044 --> 29:26.771
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess a branded memory stick duo or whatever for Third Impact.

29:27.192 --> 29:29.735
[SPEAKER_07]: They love their Evangelion over there.

29:29.995 --> 29:32.458
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, let's see, Wanda Fortune 2 and

29:36.303 --> 29:52.039
[SPEAKER_07]: Tante Boo Detective Club that's coming out I guess as well lots of stuff on the PSP which is kind of odd because in the US man there's nothing there's like maybe three titles this year and left and that's it well

29:54.004 --> 29:57.805
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and then on the Wii, not a whole lot.

29:58.166 --> 30:05.408
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pretty much just getting that Biohazard Chronicles value pack, which is the Umbrella Chronicles and Darkside Chronicles set.

30:05.708 --> 30:07.929
[SPEAKER_07]: The two gun shooter games that they had.

30:08.529 --> 30:09.469
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for the Wii.

30:10.490 --> 30:10.630
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

30:13.942 --> 30:41.513
[SPEAKER_07]: 3DS few things Hanatu Ikomo no Ritai Zukan no idea what that is but let's take a look here real quick no idea what that is looks like it has a butterfly on the cover weird maybe it's a bug collecting sim actually that could be bug collecting is kind of a big thing

30:43.275 --> 30:44.195
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a bug collecting game.

30:45.756 --> 30:49.097
[SPEAKER_07]: Bug collecting or maybe just photos or something.

30:49.437 --> 30:50.137
[SPEAKER_06]: Bird feeding.

30:50.177 --> 30:52.018
[SPEAKER_06]: You collect the bugs and feed the birds.

30:52.038 --> 31:03.982
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's something about photography because it's showing like they have stuff for shooting flowers and they've got kind of like a collage.

31:04.722 --> 31:08.163
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it looks like just nature photos or something.

31:08.984 --> 31:09.444
[SPEAKER_07]: Some sort of

31:12.112 --> 31:12.792
[SPEAKER_07]: Very niche.

31:14.634 --> 31:16.815
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, it's the Nintendo DS here.

31:20.958 --> 31:22.019
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't know if they've really got anything.

31:22.139 --> 31:23.199

31:52.507 --> 31:53.768
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo doesn't love you, Japan.

[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at least no DSs this week.

31:56.791 --> 31:56.951

[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

32:59.598 --> 32:59.819

[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then let's go ahead and do the classic game of the week.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.600
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as I find the music.

33:03.761 --> 33:07.022
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we're like, you know, flipping things around here, it's a very short show.

33:08.263 --> 33:08.703
[SPEAKER_07]: Might as well.

33:10.984 --> 33:12.285
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then let's go ahead and get right into it.

33:20.808 --> 33:27.214
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Classic Game of the Week, where I take you back in time in my TARDIS and show you games that you should have been playing.

33:27.695 --> 33:28.435
[SPEAKER_06]: But did you play them?

33:28.896 --> 33:29.316
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

33:29.937 --> 33:31.578
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you probably weren't born.

33:32.980 --> 33:33.580
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn kids.

33:35.021 --> 33:43.189
[SPEAKER_06]: Today's game is one called Quartet, that anyone who actually is a fan of Project D.Va might recognize the game.

33:44.450 --> 34:10.537
[SPEAKER_06]: you know um quartet came out in 1986 and it was an arcade game put out by Sega you could have one to four players um lead your characters through a base taken over by an army of robots and it was set in the fantasy zone as in fantasy zone and uh um space harrier in fact uh Dan was telling me that Sega had this whole thing where their set of games back in the day were all set in the fantasy zone that they were gonna say every one of their games were set there but that didn't quite catch on

34:11.932 --> 34:39.729
[SPEAKER_06]: at any rate you've got a character named Joe, Mary, Lee, or Edgar and you go through side-scrolling levels and you have to advance through the level and fight opponents that come out of portals in the walls and eventually defeat a boss that has the door key so you can go to the next level and you get different power-ups like a jetpack and springs for jumping and boosting and different kinds of fun like that so I'm going to go ahead and actually get the music playing since I didn't think about that so you can hear what it's like

34:43.550 --> 34:48.077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna start it over so you can hear it from the beginning because this is actually one of the best pieces of gaming music ever.

34:51.142 --> 34:51.663
[SPEAKER_06]: If it will play.

35:13.775 --> 35:16.757
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from the Master System, so that's actually pretty good.

35:16.797 --> 35:19.900
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, Master System games really did have a lot of great music.

35:21.181 --> 35:26.985
[SPEAKER_06]: At any rate, you've got different weapon types, different orbs that will give you power-ups.

35:27.926 --> 35:31.849
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's another player's color, then it just gives you bonus points.

35:32.609 --> 35:49.269
[SPEAKER_06]: and it came out around the same time as Gauntlet sort of like I guess Sega's answer to Gauntlet but it did come out on the Master System but you could only play as Mary or Edgar and it was misspelled E-D-G-E-R so it came out in Japan as Double Target but over here it still came out as Quartet

35:49.870 --> 35:53.274
[SPEAKER_06]: There is also home versions.

35:53.314 --> 35:57.480
[SPEAKER_06]: There were Commodore 64, Amstrad, CPC, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum.

35:58.581 --> 36:05.690
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Okie Rap and FM Funk music from the game were actually used later in the 1991 Spider-Man the video game.

36:06.591 --> 36:16.467
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Quartet 2 is an updated version that was done in a conversion kit that you can only play two players in the arcade one, but you could still select your characters.

36:16.567 --> 36:18.751
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's the game of the week is Quartet.

36:19.332 --> 36:19.692
[SPEAKER_06]: Now...

36:21.320 --> 36:38.853
[SPEAKER_06]: I was mentioning that fans of Project Diva should be able to recognize this song because a version of the song was used in Project Diva 2nd or I know it was in Project Diva Arcade so I was going to play a little bit of that for you guys now but if you stay tuned after the show, I'll play the whole thing.

36:42.096 --> 36:42.576
[SPEAKER_06]: So here it goes.

37:08.317 --> 37:28.787
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to skip up the music, guys.

37:32.769 --> 37:34.570
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the version from Project Diva.

37:35.191 --> 37:35.771
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool, huh?

37:36.871 --> 37:37.112
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

37:37.532 --> 37:37.712
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

37:40.834 --> 37:41.255
[SPEAKER_06]: What next?

37:42.620 --> 37:42.981
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

37:43.282 --> 37:44.646
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on along here.

37:44.666 --> 37:45.849
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a few more stories left.

37:48.982 --> 37:49.823
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see here.

37:50.123 --> 37:56.567
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we were talking a little bit about, you know, Project D.Va and, you know, kind of reminds me of actually some of the Bomani games.

37:57.188 --> 38:03.592
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a new Bomani, well, not technically a new Bomani game, but a new game to the arcades, I should say.

38:04.153 --> 38:08.796
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Evolution, which was basically titled Dance Masters over here in the U.S.

38:08.816 --> 38:13.959
[SPEAKER_07]: You may remember it as kind of the Kinect dancing game from Konami that didn't really sell very well, but...

38:15.240 --> 38:16.341
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like Para, I guess.

38:17.182 --> 38:25.389
[SPEAKER_07]: But now it is making full circle and going to the arcades where they have an actual cabinet that's being location tested right now.

38:26.811 --> 38:37.200
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love the first licensed song because it does kind of sum up everything.

38:37.801 --> 38:40.303
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first licensed song is Irony.

38:41.564 --> 38:47.187
[SPEAKER_07]: Irony by Clary S and a couple other Japanese songs.

38:47.507 --> 38:52.690
[SPEAKER_07]: One from AKB48 and Morning Musume.

38:53.390 --> 38:56.932
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, some Konami originals on the cabinet as well.

38:56.992 --> 39:00.735
[SPEAKER_07]: Agatia's Dream by Naoki featuring Smell Decay.

39:01.015 --> 39:04.777
[SPEAKER_07]: Into Your Heart, the Roughage remix, Naoki featuring Yasmin.

39:05.537 --> 39:26.681
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep On Movin' by NMR, Kimono Princess by June, My Summer Love by Mitsuo with Gela, and let's see, Open Your Eyes, Naokimeda featuring JB, and Still In My Heart by Naoki, and Unity by The Remembers.

39:28.161 --> 39:28.941
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds fun.

39:29.981 --> 39:34.222
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd have to really do a lot of the upgrades to make it compete with just getting a home version.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.224
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's basically, yeah.

39:36.264 --> 39:40.274
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, from the look of the cabinet, it's got a camera in there as well.

39:40.614 --> 39:43.301
[SPEAKER_07]: And they didn't really show any sort of, like...

39:45.814 --> 39:46.875
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

40:12.918 --> 40:17.448
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, looking at the screenshots, it looks just like a straight port of the game.

40:17.608 --> 40:22.017
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, interesting, I guess.

40:22.278 --> 40:22.579
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

40:23.649 --> 40:24.029
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd play it.

40:24.049 --> 40:26.950
[SPEAKER_06]: Then again, I like Dance Masters.

40:27.750 --> 40:35.772
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I would, but it lacked some stuff as far as cues on what the hell to do.

40:36.993 --> 40:39.473
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, if you're used to playing par, I guess it's not too different.

40:39.754 --> 40:46.155
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, especially not too different if you're playing certain songs in the game because the par routines are basically the routines from the game.

40:47.256 --> 40:48.336
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I don't know.

40:49.807 --> 40:50.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's still pretty neat.

40:50.630 --> 40:53.980
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually really want to see a machine before I pass judgment on it.

40:54.903 --> 40:57.130
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we'll get one over here eventually.

40:58.860 --> 41:02.721
[SPEAKER_06]: And in other news, now there is a game that I have mentioned to everybody before.

41:02.941 --> 41:04.081
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Snatcher.

41:05.062 --> 41:10.423
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a radio drama called Datcher, S-D-A-T-H-E-R.

41:11.123 --> 41:13.824
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first two episodes of it have been translated.

41:14.924 --> 41:16.664
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's actually pretty cool.

41:17.044 --> 41:24.066
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will link that to the chat room so that anyone who is a Snatcher fan will be able to see it.

41:26.593 --> 41:32.497
[SPEAKER_06]: I would actually just like for them to do another update of the game so I can play it again.

41:33.738 --> 41:49.929
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe as soon as he finishes all the other damn projects he has on deck, like the Metal Gear Solid 3D game for 3DS that's still not out yet, or oh, I don't know, the Metal Gear Rising game that's I don't even know where the hell happened with that game.

41:49.989 --> 41:50.349
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's

41:51.869 --> 41:53.049
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the end of next year.

41:53.649 --> 41:57.611
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, he has his new Fox engine that he's working on games for.

41:57.691 --> 41:59.271
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it could be a while.

42:01.912 --> 42:10.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I would very much like to... See, that's the problem with talented people that get too much on their plate.

42:10.474 --> 42:12.354
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get the right stuff on their plate.

42:13.775 --> 42:14.655
[SPEAKER_06]: At least to come out anyway.

42:15.037 --> 42:16.098
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, I agree, Zeether.

42:16.619 --> 42:17.860
[SPEAKER_06]: Snatcher kicks ass.

42:18.160 --> 42:26.448
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually got Snatcher for PS1, but of course it's all in Japanese and my husband lost patience with it really quickly.

42:28.049 --> 42:28.429
[SPEAKER_06]: But who knows.

42:28.509 --> 42:31.752
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go ahead and open up Ye Olde Skype line.

42:32.453 --> 42:34.515
[SPEAKER_06]: I will change this to online.

42:35.176 --> 42:36.177
[SPEAKER_06]: You can give us a call.

42:36.297 --> 42:37.958
[SPEAKER_06]: Our number is 1-8... Is it 866...

42:47.456 --> 42:49.119
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you afraid?

42:53.795 --> 42:55.296
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are we waiting for calls to come in?

42:55.757 --> 42:59.240
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to read a couple of things.

42:59.440 --> 43:02.002
[SPEAKER_07]: A third round of songs have been announced for Dance Dance Revolution 2.

43:02.242 --> 43:07.246
[SPEAKER_07]: In case you're interested in picking up the Wii version, I'm glad to see that DM Ashura is still getting work.

43:08.067 --> 43:09.648
[SPEAKER_07]: He has a song in there called Aftershock.

43:09.788 --> 43:12.451
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, of course, K with Dirty Digital.

43:13.592 --> 43:14.673
[SPEAKER_07]: Dummy by Ram.

43:15.693 --> 43:19.436
[SPEAKER_07]: In Love With You by Kotaru featuring Ea.

43:20.717 --> 43:45.346
[SPEAKER_07]: um Sakura Storm by Ryu Star also uh Delta Max by DM Asura as well man it's really funny seeing all the uh old Bomani DWI step mania artists getting songs into these games nowadays you said DWI yeah fans with intensity stuff it's old school yeah I'm saying that old school

43:46.289 --> 43:48.711
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, looks like no one's... Oh, we just got a caller.

43:49.471 --> 43:51.493
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will go ahead and pick this up.

43:52.654 --> 43:54.295
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you've reached OLR.

43:54.395 --> 43:54.855
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

43:55.856 --> 43:56.997
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, it's CD Thunder.

43:57.517 --> 44:00.159
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, CD Thunder, and a happy belated birthday to you.

44:01.139 --> 44:01.820
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

44:02.220 --> 44:02.520
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

44:02.540 --> 44:03.001
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's up?

44:03.041 --> 44:03.501
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

44:05.262 --> 44:05.923
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too much.

44:06.003 --> 44:08.825
[SPEAKER_04]: Just have a couple things to discuss.

44:10.266 --> 44:10.466
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

44:11.599 --> 44:19.261
[SPEAKER_04]: I've, uh, first thing is, um, I'd like to talk about one of my favorite video game characters of all time.

44:19.862 --> 44:20.502
[SPEAKER_06]: And who is that?

44:21.182 --> 44:21.662
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario.

44:22.102 --> 44:22.202
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

44:24.183 --> 44:25.263
[SPEAKER_06]: So why is Mario your favorite?

44:26.844 --> 44:27.884
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorites.

44:28.004 --> 44:28.964
[SPEAKER_06]: One of your favorites, okay.

44:29.184 --> 44:30.665
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you want to say about Mario?

44:31.670 --> 44:32.351
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireflower, Feather, Cape

44:56.522 --> 45:03.608
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm actually a really fan of Pulse Boot, not Pulse, that's Pulse Voice I'm thinking of, of the little boot thing.

45:03.748 --> 45:04.589
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kubrick shoe?

45:04.729 --> 45:05.509
[SPEAKER_06]: Kubrick, thank you.

45:06.330 --> 45:08.332
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've seen that before, actually.

45:08.372 --> 45:09.673
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Super Mario Bros.

45:09.933 --> 45:09.673
3.

45:10.774 --> 45:10.874
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

45:11.995 --> 45:17.179
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I... Yeah, I mean, I haven't played many of the games.

45:17.239 --> 45:22.083
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've played, like, Super Mario... The new Super Mario Bros.

45:22.103 --> 45:23.904
[SPEAKER_04]: for the DS and a lot of others, but...

45:27.051 --> 45:28.252
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like everything about him.

45:29.013 --> 45:29.493
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

45:30.314 --> 45:32.836
[SPEAKER_06]: So you said there were a couple of things you wanted to talk about.

45:32.856 --> 45:33.376
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the other?

45:34.797 --> 45:37.720
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one is I want to talk about prototype.

45:38.280 --> 45:39.041
[SPEAKER_06]: Prototype, okay.

45:40.642 --> 45:44.385
[SPEAKER_04]: What I like about that is you're a guy who's basically a human weapon.

45:44.545 --> 45:46.087
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do pretty much everything.

45:48.749 --> 45:51.131
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could blow up the earth if you wanted to?

45:54.766 --> 45:55.267
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you say?

45:55.327 --> 45:56.748
[SPEAKER_04]: You could blow up the earth if you wanted to.

45:57.648 --> 46:03.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe, but like how you can... What is it called?

46:03.853 --> 46:09.096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you consume other people and you can actually turn into them if you need to to sneak around places.

46:10.497 --> 46:12.199
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like episodes of Supernatural.

46:12.299 --> 46:14.520
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, are you looking forward to the sequel coming out next year?

46:15.361 --> 46:16.221
[SPEAKER_04]: Prototype 2?

46:17.602 --> 46:21.245
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't actually seen anything about that, so I'm not sure what I feel on that yet.

46:24.119 --> 46:42.948
[SPEAKER_04]: and uh and what you basically do with your character is a lot of free running the parkour stuff because you can you run up the walls and do flips and all that type of thing yeah that's pretty cool I didn't ever play it oh really I've been too busy playing WoW

46:44.309 --> 46:44.589
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict?

46:45.751 --> 46:47.432
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's my dealer and I can't yell at him.

46:51.657 --> 46:55.281
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to see what you guys thought of Mario.

46:56.522 --> 46:57.743
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your opinions on him?

46:58.344 --> 46:58.784
[SPEAKER_06]: Iconic.

46:59.145 --> 46:59.926
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I can say.

47:03.229 --> 47:04.390
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good character, I guess.

47:04.651 --> 47:05.912
[SPEAKER_07]: Good franchise for Nintendo.

47:10.228 --> 47:12.970
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, that was pretty much all I wanted to call in about.

47:13.090 --> 47:16.332
[SPEAKER_04]: And, yeah, birthday was yesterday and I turned 19.

47:17.112 --> 47:18.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Party time!

47:18.233 --> 47:18.953
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday.

47:18.993 --> 47:20.874
[SPEAKER_06]: You're only two years away from the big party.

47:21.835 --> 47:22.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

47:23.196 --> 47:24.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you have a good one.

47:24.276 --> 47:25.097
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for calling in.

47:25.737 --> 47:25.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

47:26.378 --> 47:26.858
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

47:29.019 --> 47:31.981
[SPEAKER_06]: So, any other callers want to give us a call?

47:32.201 --> 47:37.204
[SPEAKER_06]: You can call us at 877-GAME-OLR or reach us on Skype or Orange Sounds Radio.

47:38.004 --> 47:38.665
[SPEAKER_06]: Please call...

47:40.684 --> 47:42.045
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're waiting for more calls here.

47:43.746 --> 47:51.594
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of neat, Assassin's Creed, one of those games now that they're going to be adding more content to the PlayStation 3 version in the form of an older game.

47:52.454 --> 48:05.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like how Bioshock Infinite is going to have the original Bioshock in there, Assassin's Creed Revelations is going to have the original Assassin's Creed on the same disc because, you know, hey, the game doesn't use up all the Blu-ray space and they can do that and...

48:06.207 --> 48:11.030
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, they haven't really done anything to the original game as far as adding trophy support or anything like that.

48:11.110 --> 48:15.152
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, you get another game in case you maybe don't have the first Assassin's Creed.

48:16.412 --> 48:16.692
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

48:17.333 --> 48:17.753
[SPEAKER_07]: Need a guess.

48:19.974 --> 48:24.036
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I was going to mention Final Fantasy XIV is actually getting some updates.

48:25.197 --> 48:25.697
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a call.

48:25.777 --> 48:27.018
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we hold that one for after?

48:28.138 --> 48:29.859
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, thank you for calling Orange Jones Radio.

48:30.019 --> 48:30.800
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is this?

48:31.650 --> 48:33.031
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Kaijudo, can you hear me?

48:33.291 --> 48:33.912
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can.

48:33.972 --> 48:34.813
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Kaijudo.

48:35.574 --> 48:36.054
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?

48:36.454 --> 48:43.160
[SPEAKER_02]: Really don't know what to talk about, but your last caller, when he was talking about Mario, and it made me think about something.

48:43.681 --> 48:46.023
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hell doesn't Mario have a kid yet?

48:46.583 --> 48:47.664
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how old is he by now?

48:48.525 --> 48:49.026
[SPEAKER_02]: About 40, 50?

48:49.326 --> 48:53.850
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but they say that sometimes obesity affects fertility.

48:55.291 --> 48:55.371
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

48:56.815 --> 49:02.677
[SPEAKER_06]: That maybe, you know, he seems to be a very, well, maybe, you know, fungus people and humans aren't compatible.

49:03.918 --> 49:04.478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe so.

49:04.498 --> 49:08.579
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I forgot that Princess Peach isn't necessarily from this dimension.

49:08.799 --> 49:12.781
[SPEAKER_06]: Either that or she's, you know, produced spores, but they mutated and turned into Goombas.

49:15.871 --> 49:19.832
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't know, I guess next thing I talk about is games I'm looking forward to.

49:19.932 --> 49:29.095
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been going over my game list, like what I plan on buying and I just realized that I don't think I'm buying anything for the Xbox 360 for the rest of this year.

49:29.235 --> 49:29.515
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

49:30.035 --> 49:33.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think everything that I'm buying is basically going to be for PlayStation 3.

49:34.616 --> 49:42.118
[SPEAKER_02]: Battlefield 3, I'm getting for PlayStation 3 just because, you know, it's like single disc and you're promised there's...

49:43.632 --> 49:44.472
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh, sorry.

49:45.333 --> 49:46.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a call back, sorry.

49:47.713 --> 49:47.994
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

49:51.755 --> 49:52.295
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?

49:52.635 --> 49:56.356
[SPEAKER_06]: I accidentally picked up a call by accident, so my bad.

49:57.937 --> 49:58.277
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

49:58.837 --> 50:05.419
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to call... Yeah, this is ghetto-ass broken radio.

50:07.265 --> 50:09.466
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I didn't mean, I called you again by accident.

50:09.486 --> 50:10.706
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have Rob edit this out.

50:11.187 --> 50:12.887
[SPEAKER_06]: I will call you back as soon as this call is over.

50:12.927 --> 50:13.308
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?

50:13.888 --> 50:14.248
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

50:14.268 --> 50:15.028
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

50:22.171 --> 50:24.512
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now I'm trying to figure out how to accept the call again.

50:25.333 --> 50:25.873
[SPEAKER_06]: Resume call.

50:26.053 --> 50:26.733
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, sorry.

50:28.994 --> 50:29.294
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you there?

50:32.304 --> 50:32.644
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm here.

50:32.744 --> 50:33.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?

50:33.064 --> 50:34.845
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry.

50:35.526 --> 50:38.987
[SPEAKER_06]: We got another caller pop up and accidentally hit the answer button, so it put you on hold.

50:39.868 --> 50:40.148
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

50:40.548 --> 50:41.909
[SPEAKER_06]: So, my apologies.

50:41.949 --> 50:44.230
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm normally not the one that handles the skyline, as you can tell.

50:45.391 --> 50:46.931
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm getting, like, double talk now.

50:47.692 --> 50:48.392
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fun.

50:48.792 --> 50:50.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Well... Oh, wait a second.

50:50.993 --> 50:51.494
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there it is.

50:51.634 --> 50:51.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

50:51.914 --> 50:53.214
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned down my computer.

50:53.675 --> 50:54.175
[SPEAKER_06]: That would help.

50:54.995 --> 50:56.016
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm sorry, what were you saying?

50:56.056 --> 50:59.317
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so, I mean, every game that I'm getting is pretty much going to be for PS3.

50:59.337 --> 51:00.318
[SPEAKER_02]: I just realized that, so...

51:01.465 --> 51:01.785
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

51:02.225 --> 51:03.146
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'm the only one.

51:03.166 --> 51:06.847
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe 2012 is going to be the year of PS3 maybe.

51:07.687 --> 51:10.488
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it seems like it's about time they did something right, huh?

51:11.208 --> 51:11.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

51:12.148 --> 51:12.648
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about time.

51:13.129 --> 51:16.250
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, it's like we said, the system's only as good as the games that are on it.

51:16.970 --> 51:17.530
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.

51:18.210 --> 51:18.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

51:19.591 --> 51:19.771
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

51:19.991 --> 51:20.411
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.

51:20.471 --> 51:21.011
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, goodnight.

51:21.271 --> 51:22.351
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, sorry for the mix-up.

51:22.892 --> 51:23.392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's no problem.

51:23.512 --> 51:23.992
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, bye-bye.

51:26.858 --> 51:35.381
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now I will try to get a hold of Zeether again, who was calling and I was being a derp.

51:37.022 --> 51:37.842
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Zeether, are you there?

51:40.223 --> 51:42.123
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, it's Zeether from the chat.

51:42.263 --> 51:42.864
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

51:44.584 --> 51:47.725
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking of something to call about, and I finally thought of something.

51:48.966 --> 51:50.826
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard of Retro Game Challenge, right?

51:50.846 --> 51:51.687
[SPEAKER_01]: The DS game?

51:52.427 --> 51:52.647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

51:52.667 --> 51:52.747
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

51:55.101 --> 52:06.050
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching the show that it's based on, Game Center CX and it is awesome it is just one of the best things I've ever watched one of the best Japanese television shows I've ever watched so what do you like about it?

52:07.491 --> 52:21.962
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really fun to watch because it has this guy struggling to get through the games to get to the end and it's just cool watching him constantly try to make it through and spending out these hours planning things out and getting through it

52:24.281 --> 52:25.222
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds pretty cool.

52:25.302 --> 52:26.823
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just, you like the struggle.

52:27.664 --> 52:31.547
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very, they make it, like, overly dramatic sometimes.

52:31.608 --> 52:36.872
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, he'll be at, like, this impasse, and they'll be like, and they'll be like, oh, how is he gonna get through this?

52:36.932 --> 52:39.555
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he gonna be able to beat this enemy that's giving him trouble?

52:39.615 --> 52:45.860
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, in one episode, he was doing ghosts and goblins, and the red demon was constantly giving him hell.

52:46.881 --> 52:49.383
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, how is he gonna get past this guy?

52:49.423 --> 52:50.985
[SPEAKER_01]: He's stuck in game over hell.

52:51.591 --> 52:57.353
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that, I can imagine, too, because, like, that last level is especially crappy with the red demon.

52:57.993 --> 53:04.734
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, and when he found out he had to do it all over again, he was like, I'm not gonna do this, I'm gonna just hand it over to one of the other guys, he's gonna do it.

53:05.635 --> 53:09.536
[SPEAKER_06]: It's... Oh, yeah, because you beat the game, and then it's like, no, go back.

53:09.556 --> 53:10.996
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, you have to do it again.

53:11.496 --> 53:14.257
[SPEAKER_06]: That, that was, that game was, like, one of the ultimate in rage quits.

53:15.276 --> 53:41.672
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah it's definitely and he actually I actually found out the guy who was on the guy who did the guy on the show who does the gate planes playing the games his name is Arno he was actually in California at one point that like a couple weeks ago he was doing a special taped special that was going to be him going to the US and and a lot of people showed up that's pretty cool

53:43.169 --> 53:46.510
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Retro Game Challenge game is also extremely fun.

53:46.790 --> 53:48.951
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely one of my favorite DS games.

53:50.091 --> 53:55.613
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to check that out, given, you know, my husband and I are like the huge game, old school game people.

53:56.134 --> 53:57.014
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very good.

53:57.174 --> 54:00.255
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some really, really good games in it.

54:00.295 --> 54:08.838
[SPEAKER_01]: The sequel didn't come out here, but there's actually a group that's working on a fan translation for it, and so far, from what I can tell, it looks pretty close to what we got here for the first game.

54:09.238 --> 54:09.998
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds awesome.

54:11.119 --> 54:11.419
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

54:13.044 --> 54:19.255
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah, Snatcher really good game, Snatcher is fantastic I've still been trying to find a Sega CD copy

54:20.228 --> 54:21.608
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it's really hard to find it.

54:21.708 --> 54:24.649
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just had to emulate, but it's really good.

54:25.450 --> 54:26.350
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like it.

54:26.970 --> 54:27.950
[SPEAKER_01]: The plot is great.

54:28.491 --> 54:33.612
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get back to it because I've gotten pretty far into the... pretty decently far into the game.

54:34.372 --> 54:35.193
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really good.

54:35.213 --> 54:36.053
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the music.

54:36.113 --> 54:38.354
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the voice acting.

54:38.394 --> 54:42.055
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very well done for a game that's from the early 90s.

54:42.255 --> 54:43.455
[SPEAKER_06]: The little Metal Gear cameo.

54:44.216 --> 54:46.136
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Metal Gear walking around.

54:46.976 --> 54:47.797
[SPEAKER_01]: I especially liked...

54:49.045 --> 55:15.729
[SPEAKER_01]: the club, the Outer Heaven Club and when you went there you got to pick a mask and I picked the Moai head and there was all the Konami characters there and who was it Gillian was like, I don't know if we fit in and Metal Gear was like, I think we fit in more than you think and I kind of caught that subtle Gradius reference very, very cool Yeah, that's super neat Well, pretty cool So you got anything else for us?

55:16.488 --> 55:17.288
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nothing else.

55:17.628 --> 55:20.229
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well I'm sorry that I hung up on you earlier.

55:21.069 --> 55:21.689
[SPEAKER_01]: It's alright.

55:22.489 --> 55:24.830
[SPEAKER_06]: I attribute that to derp, because it's the derpisode.

55:25.390 --> 55:26.370
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mad buggy.

55:27.931 --> 55:28.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Bug report!

55:29.511 --> 55:29.851
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

55:29.871 --> 55:30.431
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, later.

55:31.091 --> 55:31.471
[SPEAKER_01]: Later.

55:33.632 --> 55:35.152
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright guys, you can give us a call.

55:35.172 --> 55:36.532
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take one more call.

55:36.733 --> 55:37.473
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at 877-GAME-OLR.

55:39.687 --> 55:41.408
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any other last minute stories for us?

56:01.775 --> 56:03.056
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

56:29.591 --> 56:31.752
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you have reached Orange Lounge Radio.

56:31.812 --> 56:32.252
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is this?

56:33.012 --> 56:34.432
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, it's Xenocore from the OKC.

56:34.452 --> 56:35.032
[SPEAKER_00]: How y'all doing?

56:35.273 --> 56:35.733
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing good.

56:35.793 --> 56:36.553
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Xenocore?

56:37.653 --> 56:38.753
[SPEAKER_00]: Well rested from my trip.

56:38.794 --> 56:45.735
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you might have heard a bit when I spoke on Bobby, but yeah, driving to Florida and back is no fun.

56:45.795 --> 56:47.296
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't sound like fun at all.

56:47.316 --> 56:51.077
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, especially when it's just for family duties and not a real vacation.

56:51.137 --> 56:53.217
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we're here about games.

56:53.658 --> 56:53.838
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

56:54.478 --> 56:55.218
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is up?

56:56.509 --> 56:56.829
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much.

56:57.309 --> 57:03.791
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to include a small thing on top of, you know, Arino playing old school games on Game Center CX.

57:03.811 --> 57:07.252
[SPEAKER_00]: He also does do interviews with some of the game makers in Japan.

57:07.552 --> 57:09.753
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already talked to the guys in charge of Castlevania.

57:10.133 --> 57:13.274
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked to Kojima about Metal Gear and its history and other things like that.

57:13.594 --> 57:18.435
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that, like, for instance, Kotaku is covering the gaming that he's doing and doing some...

57:19.213 --> 57:20.994
[SPEAKER_00]: Awful voiceover and some of the stuff.

57:21.454 --> 57:28.799
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's an account on YouTube that somebody's been putting all the fan subs that have been done online.

57:29.319 --> 57:30.860
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put a link to one of them in chat.

57:30.960 --> 57:36.843
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've got over 24 of the episodes already, including the one where he went to Korea and talked to some gamers over there as well.

57:37.383 --> 57:39.244
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really an outstanding show.

57:39.925 --> 57:41.085
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to check that out.

57:41.486 --> 57:43.467
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it sounds like something totally up my alley.

57:43.567 --> 57:47.149
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've heard of it before, but I haven't ever seen any.

57:47.918 --> 57:50.162
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right around 903 in chat.

57:50.202 --> 57:52.806
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take that link, that'll give you the account name.

57:52.846 --> 57:54.849
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like Active Circle or something like that.

57:54.889 --> 57:56.692
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's putting all that stuff on there.

57:56.712 --> 57:57.373
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give it a go.

57:57.995 --> 57:59.817
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing...

58:02.186 --> 58:13.451
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still curious as to whether or not as much as I loved Space Marine I've heard rumors that the multiplayer population has already died out.

58:13.811 --> 58:14.111
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

58:14.631 --> 58:15.751
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sucks.

58:15.811 --> 58:17.392
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's accurate or not.

58:17.592 --> 58:24.095
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably just fanboys complaining but I hope not because that game was awesome and I played it from Gamefly.

58:24.455 --> 58:29.917
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to get a full version of it but I'm not going to do it if the multiplayer isn't there because that's the only thing that's left in there for me.

58:31.382 --> 58:33.843
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, if the game doesn't give you what you want, what's the point, right?

58:34.523 --> 58:38.444
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it gave me everything I wanted, but it was the single player.

58:38.504 --> 58:39.944
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you go through that, you pretty much know it.

58:40.304 --> 58:45.285
[SPEAKER_00]: As fun as it is, I'm not the kind of guy that can just do that repeatedly and get enjoyment out of it.

58:46.245 --> 58:51.786
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope they make another one, because that was an outstanding representation of what to do with that franchise.

58:52.206 --> 58:53.807
[SPEAKER_06]: They can keep their fingers crossed, right?

58:55.107 --> 58:55.827
[SPEAKER_06]: Offer a little prayer.

58:56.584 --> 58:57.024
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, yep.

58:58.465 --> 58:59.606
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome job today, guys.

59:00.347 --> 59:02.588
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky isn't missing a thing, so good job.

59:02.648 --> 59:08.012
[SPEAKER_06]: He actually just texted that he made it to San Francisco, and I was going to reply that I'm hateful and jealous, but nah.

59:09.193 --> 59:09.933
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.

59:09.993 --> 59:16.378
[SPEAKER_00]: He has to stay in the audience with the rest of the... Granted, Lady Tron's playing, but he's going to get funk right all over him, so you know.

59:16.758 --> 59:18.299
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's going to come back smelling like pot.

59:21.301 --> 59:22.222
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he's going to get sick.

59:22.342 --> 59:22.782
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

59:23.243 --> 59:24.263
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, thank you for calling.

59:24.443 --> 59:25.104
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have anything else?

59:25.936 --> 59:27.618
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's pretty much it, pretty light today.

59:28.158 --> 59:31.422
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty, well you take care and we will hear from you next week, maybe?

59:32.283 --> 59:32.663
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.

59:33.124 --> 59:35.506
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week we actually have a special guest on the show.

59:36.167 --> 59:36.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Another host.

59:37.268 --> 59:38.830
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Dan, so I guess he's not that special.

59:38.870 --> 59:39.570
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he's special.

59:40.231 --> 59:41.132
[SPEAKER_06]: Special to me.

59:41.573 --> 59:43.114
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit special.

59:43.855 --> 59:46.418
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, bye-bye.

59:46.438 --> 59:47.339
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, later.

59:48.675 --> 59:56.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that was our last call of the night and sorry anyone else who was trying to get in because believe it or not we did have people trying to get in but nope, that was it.

59:56.778 --> 59:58.779
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually do have another story.

59:59.619 --> 01:00:07.282
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little story that came to us courtesy of Tiger Claw.

01:00:08.322 --> 01:00:14.965
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's that Microsoft is allowing a small number of mistakenly banned Xbox 360 players back on Xbox Live.

01:00:16.278 --> 01:00:27.588
[SPEAKER_06]: So they actually, Stephen Toulouse wrote a blog about that some of the suspensions were mistakenly made by a different software being used and so they are bringing those people back.

01:00:27.628 --> 01:00:32.672
[SPEAKER_06]: They're unbanning them and will give them a free three month subscription to Xbox Live Gold and 1600 Microsoft points.

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:43.095
[SPEAKER_06]: and they said it was a very specific issue and it happened between August 29th and September 9th so they've got it lined up.

01:00:44.056 --> 01:00:46.497
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that's nice of them saying, oh, we screwed up here.

01:00:49.265 --> 01:00:51.206
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have anything else for us?

01:00:51.386 --> 01:00:56.029
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one thing real quick, and it's more of a PSA than anything.

01:00:56.629 --> 01:01:00.791
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember I talked about the Tommy Wee Show?

01:01:01.572 --> 01:01:08.835
[SPEAKER_07]: That, I guess, is something that's running from Machima on YouTube and stuff like that.

01:01:09.255 --> 01:01:13.758
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they had the first episode featuring Tommy Wiseau.

01:01:14.558 --> 01:01:38.765
[SPEAKER_07]: and it is fucking stupid first off it's a ripoff of Mr. Sanctuary 3000 secondly Tommy Wiseau cannot form English sentences he's just it's just so fucking stupid and the only humor that you'd find in this is that he's really stupid so I mean if you like watching stupid people play games I'm sure there's plenty of

01:01:40.555 --> 01:01:41.216
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

01:01:51.585 --> 01:02:18.418
[SPEAKER_07]: well that's just and it's not even to the fact that he's mocking a game being played it's him playing a game while this alien's mocking him and I mean at one point he accidentally hits the playstation button and it goes to the cross menu bar and he's just how do I get out of this I mean it's dumb so please don't watch it just let it die in a fire

01:02:18.849 --> 01:02:19.389
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.310
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's it for OLR.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.391
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm actually going to go ahead and play.

01:02:25.332 --> 01:02:26.592
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you know, I closed the show roll.

01:02:26.612 --> 01:02:27.032
[SPEAKER_06]: So never mind.

01:02:27.052 --> 01:02:27.913
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to play anything.

01:02:28.313 --> 01:02:31.314
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to give everyone a little bitty tip.

01:02:31.774 --> 01:02:37.857
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned after the show and you will hear a blast from the past in the form of a modified pump up the volume.

01:02:38.957 --> 01:02:40.778
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you have any final thoughts?

01:02:42.337 --> 01:02:42.638
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, no.

01:02:43.398 --> 01:02:50.904
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't have any either, except that I'm just gonna do some music for about an hour so that you guys don't feel, you know, like we've gone, huh, don't wanna, okay.

01:02:51.445 --> 01:02:52.906
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, thank you for listening.
