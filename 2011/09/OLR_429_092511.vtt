00:00.000 --> 00:24.600
The PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch, and Sony adds a controversial new

00:24.600 --> 00:32.440
section to the PSN terms of service.

00:32.440 --> 00:38.640
Hello and welcome to episode 429 of this derpisode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.640 --> 00:44.160
I am your hostess of the evening, DarkSakura, and with me always is our techmaster, Loki.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.160
Hello.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.960
Yes, this is take two because someone was forgetting to start recording.

00:49.960 --> 00:54.560
Because someone's very jealous that Rob's off seeing Ladytron tonight in San Francisco.

00:54.560 --> 00:55.560
Blah.

00:55.560 --> 00:58.120
So anyway, what are we?

00:58.120 --> 01:01.600
We are the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.400
Be it digitized, or if we're saying it for you, or whatever.

01:06.400 --> 01:11.200
So over the next few hours we will be talking about game stuff, and we tape live every week

01:11.200 --> 01:14.200
on allgamesradio.com.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.800
And that starts at six o'clock pacific time, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.160
And if you're listening to us live, get in our chat room.

01:20.160 --> 01:25.000
It's chat dot Orange Lounge Radio dot com, and we are on Game Surge server.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.240
So Loki, again, how was Earth Defense Force?

01:27.240 --> 01:28.480
It was good.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.160
That's what I've been playing this week among other things like Grand Theft Auto.

01:32.160 --> 01:39.280
Of course, as I was saying, the survival mode in that game, it's difficult because they

01:39.280 --> 01:43.520
basically give you the lowest tier weapons possible, and then they put you up against

01:43.520 --> 01:46.520
lots and lots of really hard bugs.

01:46.520 --> 01:50.520
And thankfully you do get up to six players, which is kind of cool, although we didn't

01:50.520 --> 01:54.440
get to play very long because our internet connection at work is kind of sketchy.

01:54.440 --> 02:04.440
It drops us every now and then, or more often than every now and then, pretty often actually.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.440
And then, you know, Grand Theft Auto.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.240
That was the usual Grand Theft Auto stuff.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.680
Still trying to keep my winning streak going.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.120
And what else did I try?

02:14.120 --> 02:20.320
Well actually, it wasn't really game-related, but I did mess around with the Xbox Marketplace

02:20.320 --> 02:21.320
a little bit.

02:21.320 --> 02:26.000
I watched my wife on the Watch An Episode of Up All Night, and so we watched that real

02:26.000 --> 02:27.880
quick and it actually worked out pretty good.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.560
I never really used the Zune Marketplace before, so that was kind of neat.

02:31.560 --> 02:37.640
And then also got to check out, well, I browsed and buy some of the Xbox Live and E Games,

02:37.640 --> 02:39.440
and man, there's some weird shit on there.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.440
I don't even know.

02:41.440 --> 02:44.440
There was a game I saw that was about prank calling people.

02:44.440 --> 02:49.720
There was the Babymaker Extreme 2, I know, and we've talked about that before.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.720
Looks hilarious.

02:50.720 --> 02:57.460
I didn't pick it up though, but just a lot of stuff that's on there that's not great,

02:57.460 --> 03:03.600
but it is kind of hard to navigate everything, so hopefully they fix that and maybe with

03:03.600 --> 03:07.700
one of these updates, maybe the next fall dashboard update will fix the store a little

03:07.700 --> 03:12.000
bit so it's easier to find stuff.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.520
I think that's really all that I've played.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.520
Maybe a little bit more Zelda.

03:14.520 --> 03:20.720
I don't remember if I actually played that or not this week, but yeah, that's about it.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.200
I played well.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.200
That's it.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.080
Well, you're consistent.

03:26.080 --> 03:31.720
So moving forward, as has been mentioned, Rob isn't here, so we're doing a short show

03:31.720 --> 03:36.120
tonight, but everyone needs to be a little pumped for what's coming on a little after.

03:36.120 --> 03:39.760
I'm doing a throwback to the past so that people don't feel like we're shortchanging

03:39.760 --> 03:45.840
them because we love you, not in a romantic way or anything, but in a way.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.880
We do.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.920
So why don't we go ahead and get right into our stories of the night.

03:49.920 --> 03:50.920
All right.

03:50.920 --> 03:57.480
Well, it's been kind of the longest anticipated announcement, at least this year.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.600
People are starting to get worried that Star Wars The Old Republic wasn't going to be coming

04:00.600 --> 04:05.400
out this year, and maybe it prompted them to announce a release date for this year based

04:05.400 --> 04:09.720
on the fact that certain other games may be coming out a little later.

04:09.720 --> 04:15.160
But yes, The Old Republic will be shipping on December 20th, and of course they do have

04:15.160 --> 04:17.820
some details on what it's going to cost you.

04:17.820 --> 04:20.400
They have different subscription packages.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.720
You can go month to month, which is $14.99.

04:22.720 --> 04:29.000
Of course, each game does come with a 30-day subscription that runs out, and after 30 days

04:29.000 --> 04:30.480
you have to pay for it.

04:30.480 --> 04:36.600
If you choose to pay for some of your months in a lump sum, you will save a little bit

04:36.600 --> 04:37.600
of money.

04:37.600 --> 04:42.520
Three months at a time will break it down to $13.99 a month, and then six months at

04:42.520 --> 04:44.660
a time, $12.99 a month.

04:44.660 --> 04:49.320
So if you're dedicated to playing this game for a long time, maybe the lump sums are the

04:49.320 --> 04:50.320
way to go.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.320
You know what?

04:51.320 --> 04:52.320
What?

04:52.320 --> 04:57.000
I had the opportunity to get a lifetime membership for Star Trek Online, and now I'm very glad

04:57.000 --> 04:59.840
I didn't because it's going free to play.

04:59.840 --> 05:03.320
So, I would advise everyone, hold off.

05:03.320 --> 05:06.680
Well, lifetime memberships, yeah, you might hold off on that because you never know the

05:06.680 --> 05:10.400
life cycle of these games nowadays that a lot of them grow up free to play, but six

05:10.400 --> 05:11.400
months isn't bad.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.360
I imagine that Star Wars games are going to be around for at least six months.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.200
Yeah, well, who knows?

05:17.200 --> 05:24.960
I mean, I quit playing, well no, that was February of, no I started playing in February,

05:24.960 --> 05:27.600
I quit actually a year ago.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.600
Star Trek Online.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.600
This month.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.600
No.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.600
Nope, in two months, sorry.

05:31.600 --> 05:35.880
Anyway, but yeah, I'd say though, six months is fine, but if they offer any type of lifetime

05:35.880 --> 05:37.160
thing, don't do it.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.160
Don't do it.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.240
Not even if they give you a lightsaber that works.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.800
Well, maybe that's worth it.

05:43.800 --> 05:51.440
Well, in other news, we have something about Sega of Europe.

05:51.440 --> 05:55.200
John Smedley is saying that they're a free to play model for DC.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.200
Sony.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.200
Sony.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.200
Sony Entertainment.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.200
I don't know why I said Sony.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.960
You know what?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.960
I'm derp.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.960
I'm still mad at Rob.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.520
I'm still mad at Rob.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.920
I'm not really mad at Rob.

06:08.920 --> 06:09.920
Okay.

06:09.920 --> 06:15.800
Sony Online Entertainment has a free to play model for DC Universe Online.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.840
So it's going to be three membership levels.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.440
There's free, premium, and legendary.

06:21.440 --> 06:27.480
And they have full access to the game that has different levels of flexibility.

06:27.480 --> 06:33.440
So free players will have two character slots and new downloadable game packs and updates.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.840
Additional character slots, you can pay for them.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.080
I refuse to use the term micro transaction.

06:38.080 --> 06:42.840
Premium, so that's going to be people who have spent at least $5 on the game.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.560
That's including former subscribers and in game item purchasers will have additional

06:46.560 --> 06:50.200
character slots, inventory slots, and higher cash limits.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.800
Legendary will have the maximum, including free DLC.

06:53.800 --> 06:59.560
More than 15 character slots and more than 80 inventory slots for $15 a month.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.160
And this is happening really soon, as in next week.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.160
Yeah.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.160
So that means I can play the game.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.160
Yeah, because it's funny.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.160
Because I ain't going to pay for it.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.160
We got the message there.

07:08.160 --> 07:14.960
Yeah, you need to tell all your customers to send them back their copies of DC Universe

07:14.960 --> 07:20.200
because we're making it free to play, so they don't need those discs anymore.

07:20.200 --> 07:24.320
Well, I will be trying it out, but honestly I'm glad I didn't pay for it.

07:24.320 --> 07:28.480
Yeah, I think a lot of these MMOs should go free to play.

07:28.480 --> 07:32.880
I'm telling you, if Final Fantasy XI ever goes free to play, god I don't know.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.760
I may have to get back into that.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.720
And Nelly will wonder what happened to you.

07:37.720 --> 07:42.000
Well no, it's not that big a deal because really the whole thing is I couldn't see myself

07:42.000 --> 07:46.760
paying I think it was $13 a month or something like that for Final Fantasy XI, but I was

07:46.760 --> 07:51.680
only playing it maybe one evening a month.

07:51.680 --> 07:56.360
I can't see myself paying for that because it's just a waste of money.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.480
But free to play, that would be fine.

07:58.480 --> 08:05.280
I really wish I hadn't sold my, you know, or not really sell my stuff, but give away

08:05.280 --> 08:07.000
my stuff that I had in my bar.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
But whatever.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Yeah.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.220
That would be fun.

08:11.220 --> 08:16.560
Some more information going along the lines with, it's not really an MMO, but maybe the

08:16.560 --> 08:21.400
reason why the older republic did announce to be shipping this year, Diablo 3 is actually

08:21.400 --> 08:23.200
going to launch early 2012.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.400
It's not going to make it out this year unfortunately.

08:26.400 --> 08:32.640
They did mention that they're going to extend the beta period of course since obviously

08:32.640 --> 08:35.920
the game's going to be coming out later on, they have more time to test it and hopefully

08:35.920 --> 08:39.200
get any kinks out of it.

08:39.200 --> 08:44.080
Of course they're saying, you know, while the news may not be a complete surprise, I

08:44.080 --> 08:47.200
know many of you were hopeful that Diablo 3 would ship this year.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
We were too.

08:48.200 --> 08:54.640
Of course, they're ultimately, we felt to deliver an awesome Diablo sequel that lives

08:54.640 --> 08:59.540
up to our expectations and yours as well, we should take a little more time to add further

08:59.540 --> 09:01.500
polish to a few different elements of the game.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.600
So in other words, it was buggy and they needed to fix it.

09:03.600 --> 09:04.600
So that's fine.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.200
Well what else is new?

09:07.200 --> 09:09.520
There's too much stuff coming out this year anyways.

09:09.520 --> 09:14.480
Yeah, I just, they actually were starting to put out little warnings on World of Warcraft

09:14.480 --> 09:21.120
by the way, that if someone messages you saying, oh you've got the Diablo 3 pass here, give

09:21.120 --> 09:22.400
us your password, blah blah blah.

09:22.400 --> 09:27.600
If you give anyone your password, you're stupid, sorry.

09:27.600 --> 09:33.560
I don't even think that people sending out ones for Diablo 3 should be enough to make

09:33.560 --> 09:39.280
people lose control of their facilities.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.280
Should people like to-

09:40.280 --> 09:41.280
Their faculties.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
That'd be funny.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.280
I said facilities.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.280
Whatever.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.280
Their brain.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.280
Whatever.

09:46.280 --> 09:50.320
Well anyway, so let's move forward into other news, shall we?

09:50.320 --> 09:51.320
We shall.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.680
Speaking of Blizzard, they are talking about patch 4.3, which everyone has been all abuzz

09:55.680 --> 09:56.680
about in-game.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.920
You know, we get transmogrifying.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.720
That means you can make your new shit look like old shit.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.660
So that people don't all look the same.

10:06.660 --> 10:09.720
And then there's gonna be, and I was reading up on this the other day, and it's actually

10:09.720 --> 10:15.200
kind of exciting, is that there is a new raid content that's gonna take place all over the

10:15.200 --> 10:17.560
world of Azeroth.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.440
I thought for a second there, and I know this is wrong, that you said rape content, and

10:21.440 --> 10:23.080
I was like, what?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.080
That's weird.

10:24.080 --> 10:28.240
Well you know what, actually in the Firelands, there's a, the first boss has a dog with him

10:28.240 --> 10:31.280
named Rageface, but everyone calls him Rapeface.

10:31.280 --> 10:36.160
His attack is called Face Rage, so we just call it Face Rape.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.640
That's awesome.

10:37.640 --> 10:38.640
Yeah.

10:38.640 --> 10:43.280
Anyway, Deathwing's just not sitting around, you know, because before all he had, you know,

10:43.280 --> 10:46.600
all he was doing was showing up in areas and burning people to death if they were on the

10:46.600 --> 10:48.740
ground and not in the air.

10:48.740 --> 10:51.880
Trust me, I took forever to get that stupid achievement.

10:51.880 --> 10:57.960
So he's going to be a raid, you actually have to go into the future, go into the past, and

10:57.960 --> 11:02.240
the whole thing is gonna end on the dragon's back, so you have to pull off pieces of his

11:02.240 --> 11:09.460
plate armor as he's spinning down into the Maelstrom, ooh, and then, you know, get all

11:09.460 --> 11:13.440
stabby on him and maybe try to kill him, or at least, you know, make him really pissed

11:13.440 --> 11:16.120
off at you.

11:16.120 --> 11:22.160
It's supposed to be really, really huge, and I was reading some of the technical development

11:22.160 --> 11:28.160
behind it and said that they've had to really pull some technical strings to get it to work.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.480
I'm looking forward to seeing it, although honestly right now it's gonna be forever.

11:31.480 --> 11:35.680
And then like I said earlier, there is transmogrifying, so basically you can only change, like, one

11:35.680 --> 11:41.200
type of armor to look like the same type of armor of another level.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.960
So like, you can't change cloth mail to plate mail, you know, make it look like plate mail,

11:44.960 --> 11:48.260
and you can't make your axe look like a polearm.

11:48.260 --> 11:52.440
It has to be the same type of stuff, and it's gotta be something with stats on it.

11:52.440 --> 11:56.480
And then void storage is coming out, which is basically if you've got a bunch of stuff

11:56.480 --> 12:01.300
that you were tired of sitting in your regular storage, and you think, I'm never gonna get

12:01.300 --> 12:05.620
back to it, but for some reason I'm a pack rat and can't sell it, ew, then you can put

12:05.620 --> 12:10.080
it in your void storage and it removes all enchants and socketing, and you have to pay

12:10.080 --> 12:12.520
a lot of money to get it out.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.640
So that's it.

12:15.640 --> 12:21.360
And then of course, like I said, the Deathwing smackdown.

12:21.360 --> 12:26.400
This is kind of interesting, there was a story on Rock Paper Shocking this week, talking

12:26.400 --> 12:32.320
about, you know how there's a lot of these folding projects, the Folding at Home is a

12:32.320 --> 12:37.900
really popular one, well there was one, I guess it was a little bit newer, called Foldit,

12:37.900 --> 12:45.080
and what Foldit is, is it's not just folding with your actual system or PC or whatever

12:45.080 --> 12:51.760
that you're using, it does require some human interaction as well, so think of it like mind

12:51.760 --> 12:54.520
folding, I guess.

12:54.520 --> 13:00.560
Basically they were using this to kind of figure out how viruses like the AIDS virus

13:00.560 --> 13:08.600
worked and stuff like that, also cancer and Alzheimer's as well, and guess these are related

13:08.600 --> 13:15.280
to proteins and what the project does is I guess, basically it's spatial recognition

13:15.280 --> 13:21.880
or something, where players will, I'm not really sure what you do, but apparently it

13:21.880 --> 13:27.080
has something to do with matching stuff and based on your results and what they have in

13:27.080 --> 13:34.120
here, they have I guess figured out how these actually work now, so it's kind of cool, because

13:34.120 --> 13:40.240
apparently this is going to lead to obviously research and testing and whatnot, but it will

13:40.240 --> 13:46.480
actually lead to maybe even a cure for these diseases, thanks to this folding project,

13:46.480 --> 13:50.120
and it's pretty impressive I guess.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.600
So yeah, they're saying Foldit players leverage human three-dimensional problem solving skills

13:54.600 --> 14:00.560
to interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and algorithms from

14:00.560 --> 14:05.460
the Rosetta structure prediction mythology, and says players collaborate with teammates

14:05.460 --> 14:11.600
while competing with other players to obtain the highest score, lowest energy models, and

14:11.600 --> 14:13.400
proof of concept tests.

14:13.400 --> 14:18.320
Foldit players, most of whom have little or no background in biochemistry, were able to

14:18.320 --> 14:25.620
solve protein structure refinement problems in which backbone rearrangement was necessary

14:25.620 --> 14:31.200
to correctly bury hydrophobic residues.

14:31.200 --> 14:38.680
Here we report Foldit players' successes in real world modeling problems with complex

14:38.680 --> 14:43.720
deviations from native structures leading to the solution of a long-standing protein

14:43.720 --> 14:53.600
crystal structure problem, and they said basically, yeah this is going to possibly lead to a cure

14:53.600 --> 14:57.160
for this stuff, so that's pretty amazing.

14:57.160 --> 15:03.040
Seems to me like in some cases education might get in the way of intuition, don't you think?

15:03.040 --> 15:04.040
Yeah.

15:04.040 --> 15:08.400
Some people have a natural aptitude towards solving puzzles as long as you give it to

15:08.400 --> 15:11.080
them in a term that they're going to understand it.

15:11.080 --> 15:15.120
Yeah, and then they go on to comment a little bit more, they said, the critical role of

15:15.120 --> 15:23.760
Foldit players in the solution of the M-PMV PR structure shows the power of online games

15:23.760 --> 15:28.800
to channel human intuition and three-dimensional pattern matching skills to solve challenging

15:28.800 --> 15:33.280
scientific problems, although much attention has been recently given to the potential of

15:33.280 --> 15:38.600
crowdsourcing and game playing, this is the first instance that we are aware of in which

15:38.600 --> 15:42.400
online players solve the long-standing scientific problem.

15:42.400 --> 15:48.920
These results indicate potential for integrating video games into real world scientific process.

15:48.920 --> 15:55.720
The ingenuity of the game players is formidable force that if properly directed can be used

15:55.720 --> 15:59.680
to solve a wide range of scientific problems, so you never know, they may be just using

15:59.680 --> 16:07.160
this for other diseases, obviously potential is unlimited, new forms of energy, who knows?

16:07.160 --> 16:13.400
I was reading before that they had broken what was one of the HIV virus models, right?

16:13.400 --> 16:15.080
Yeah, this is what that's about.

16:15.080 --> 16:21.880
So think if they've come to that, this could be applied towards cancers, tumors, just about

16:21.880 --> 16:22.880
anything.

16:22.880 --> 16:23.880
Yeah.

16:23.880 --> 16:29.400
It really is a good way to get new resources, because any type of research, if it hits a

16:29.400 --> 16:33.880
dead end, it's going to need a fresh pair of eyes and a fresh brain to go with it.

16:33.880 --> 16:38.840
And the folded thing hasn't even been around that long, it's basically 236,000 players,

16:38.840 --> 16:43.760
which as far as compared to folding the home, I think that's a lot less than what they've

16:43.760 --> 16:44.760
got.

16:44.760 --> 16:51.060
Instead I guess that they've been working together the last three years, and it only

16:51.060 --> 16:57.660
took them 10 days to unravel that actual scientific problem there.

16:57.660 --> 17:02.520
So that one alone, 10 days with that many people, can you imagine if they just integrated

17:02.520 --> 17:09.160
this into all the places that the folding the home stuff is, it could be pretty powerful.

17:09.160 --> 17:15.060
And another thing too, this actually says a lot for the spirit of cooperation.

17:15.060 --> 17:18.240
This is a lot, even though they have it set up as a competition in the end, it's a lot

17:18.240 --> 17:24.400
of people working together, and they're getting results by people having a common goal and

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
working towards it.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.800
And I think that we could all stand to learn something from that.

17:28.800 --> 17:29.800
Yeah.

17:29.800 --> 17:30.800
Cool.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.280
So, moving forward, man that's actually super cool though.

17:34.280 --> 17:38.440
I mean I'm still kind of, whenever I try to think about the possibilities for that it

17:38.440 --> 17:40.920
actually makes my brain hurt a little bit.

17:40.920 --> 17:45.320
So how about something that won't make my brain hurt that much, because honestly it's

17:45.320 --> 17:46.320
not surprising.

17:46.320 --> 17:55.280
28% of 3DS users do not like the 3D feature, they say it detracts from their games.

17:55.280 --> 18:02.440
There was a study done out by the research firm Interpret LLC that said 22% of those

18:02.440 --> 18:07.760
thought the 3D improved gameplay, but 13% were so put off by the effect that they turned

18:07.760 --> 18:09.280
it off altogether.

18:09.280 --> 18:17.420
56% also found that their ideal 3D gaming experience was a 3D capable console connected

18:17.420 --> 18:23.920
to a TV, with only 7% giving a nod towards the 3DS.

18:23.920 --> 18:31.840
I think right now it's still really early, I think a lot of games aren't using it correctly.

18:31.840 --> 18:38.720
And even this goes to Nintendo, some of their design choices in games are really stupid,

18:38.720 --> 18:43.320
especially with Star Fox where they have the tilt controls and then the 3D, that doesn't

18:43.320 --> 18:44.320
work.

18:44.320 --> 18:50.520
It's going to break the 3D because your 3D method requires people to basically have a

18:50.520 --> 18:54.420
certain perspective that you view the screen at, and if you're turning and tilting the

18:54.420 --> 18:58.120
screen around it's going to break that and it's going to turn it 2D anyways.

18:58.120 --> 19:02.000
Granted you could turn the 3D off and play with the tilt controls or turn it on and play

19:02.000 --> 19:09.400
with it without tilt controls, but to fully utilize the game it's kind of impossible the

19:09.400 --> 19:12.200
way that they have it I guess, unless you're supposed to tilt your whole body with that

19:12.200 --> 19:14.200
which is kind of stupid.

19:14.200 --> 19:18.200
But yeah, 3D consoles I think is definitely the way to go.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.600
Have you noticed though that some people when they play a game that requires turning and

19:21.600 --> 19:24.880
things that they'll lean with their controller?

19:24.880 --> 19:28.040
Yeah when you're 5, I mean I don't think anyone does that anymore.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.980
I do if I really get into it, like when I was playing Katamari though I'd get motion

19:30.980 --> 19:34.480
sick so I'd actually follow the direction of the TV to keep from getting motion sick.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.800
Yeah I see and I...

19:36.800 --> 19:39.540
Then again the 3DS makes me motion sick anyway.

19:39.540 --> 19:40.540
I don't know.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.360
The moment the 3D breaks my head hurts.

19:42.360 --> 19:47.000
Maybe people they don't play games a lot because they just get really into it, but I don't

19:47.000 --> 19:48.240
think I've ever done that.

19:48.240 --> 19:52.240
I don't need my little pony in 3D.

19:52.240 --> 19:55.120
I just, I don't know, I don't really...

19:55.120 --> 19:59.200
The only time I ever see that nowadays is when they have a stupid, you know, PR shot

19:59.200 --> 20:02.560
of people playing a video game and they're so excited!

20:02.560 --> 20:06.440
They're so psyched to be playing the game and they're just really getting into it.

20:06.440 --> 20:10.920
But I mean it's just, it's just not real.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.640
Now this is something that I think is a little derpy.

20:13.640 --> 20:20.360
Is that they basically said that awareness of the device was up 60% on this time last

20:20.360 --> 20:27.720
year but 28% of that total weren't aware that it required, that it didn't require 3D glasses.

20:27.720 --> 20:31.640
Well yeah because they're probably interviewing people that have no idea what these consoles

20:31.640 --> 20:32.640
are.

20:32.640 --> 20:36.520
I mean there's a lot of people out there that don't know what, you know, the gaming consoles

20:36.520 --> 20:37.520
offer.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.080
I mean how even some celebrities.

20:39.080 --> 20:45.400
I remember that video they have of Orlando Bloom and Mark Ruffalo signing him an Xbox.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.880
Orlando Bloom didn't know what, you know, what that was.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.400
He thought, you know, is this the one, Blu-ray?

20:50.400 --> 20:53.800
I mean he didn't know because he's busy fucking making money and working.

20:53.800 --> 20:59.160
He hasn't had time to, you know, game and that kind of stuff but there's a lot of people

20:59.160 --> 21:06.000
out there that aren't really into games and aren't really aware of what's out there.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.240
I mean, granted, I think they've stepped up their advertising quite a bit for the 3DS

21:10.240 --> 21:13.240
now especially since they've dropped the price.

21:13.240 --> 21:17.120
They're kind of highlighting what's coming out in the fourth quarter with, you know,

21:17.120 --> 21:23.400
the Zelda and not, well they still show Zelda, Zelda Star Fox, Mario 3D, or Super Mario 3D

21:23.400 --> 21:25.880
Land and Mario Kart 7.

21:25.880 --> 21:30.400
So there's going to be a lot of awareness going into the fourth quarter about, you know,

21:30.400 --> 21:31.400
the 3DS.

21:31.400 --> 21:39.960
3D stuff for the Playstation a little bit, I think no whatsoever mention for the 3D stuff

21:39.960 --> 21:44.680
that they have on the 360 because there are a lot of games that do support 3D on the Xbox

21:44.680 --> 21:51.960
360 but there's no mention of that because first party wise they don't really, well actually

21:51.960 --> 21:57.880
I guess Gears 3 did, but first party wise they don't really support 3D too much.

21:57.880 --> 22:02.080
It's mainly just the third parties, the cross platform stuff like, you know, Batman Arkham

22:02.080 --> 22:08.760
Asylum or, yeah actually Arkham Asylum had 3D support, not the stereoscopic, you know,

22:08.760 --> 22:16.680
shutter glasses 3D but the red cyan glasses and then they also have, but Arkham City does

22:16.680 --> 22:20.120
have 3D support and there's some other games that do support 3D.

22:20.120 --> 22:28.280
It's just, it's not really advertised widely I guess.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.920
Huh.

22:30.920 --> 22:37.440
Well it, you know what, now I'm trying to picture playing through, not like the old

22:37.440 --> 22:41.320
school cyan magenta, like the newer ones, right?

22:41.320 --> 22:44.120
That you don't really see cyan and magenta.

22:44.120 --> 22:48.400
I've honestly, I haven't used those types of glasses in a long time and I still think

22:48.400 --> 22:51.000
that all I see is cyan and magenta and that stuff.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.540
I mean, it would be awesome if they had some sort of glasses like that that I didn't see

22:55.540 --> 23:01.360
that but I've never, I haven't seen anything like that recently that doesn't affect the

23:01.360 --> 23:02.800
color.

23:02.800 --> 23:07.240
I went to a movie not too long ago that used one of the services that was a cyan and magenta

23:07.240 --> 23:09.600
but it was a very pale one.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.600
It was interesting.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.360
You really couldn't see it.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.840
But moving forward, shall we?

23:15.840 --> 23:16.840
Release dates.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.960
Yes, Wii has release dates.

23:18.960 --> 23:23.720
The US is still gonna have a lot of stuff coming out this week.

23:23.720 --> 23:27.760
Of course, because we're in the fourth quarter technically.

23:27.760 --> 23:33.080
So starting things off, we've got FIFA Soccer 12 on the Wii, coming out a little bit later

23:33.080 --> 23:35.640
than the rest of the platforms.

23:35.640 --> 23:40.360
Some re-releases from THQ, they've got a Beach Fun 2-pack, it's just some of their old party

23:40.360 --> 23:46.720
games, and a Game Show Fun pack which is Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, that's on the Wii.

23:46.720 --> 23:52.920
Sun Slinger from Valkon, it's a generic on-rail shooter game for the Wii.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.800
Quest for Zoo from Activision.

23:55.800 --> 24:01.080
Cabela's, there's the first of four Cabela's games this year.

24:01.080 --> 24:05.600
We've got Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012, it's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and

24:05.600 --> 24:09.640
of course they've got the Top Shot Elite bundles and the Swell with those.

24:09.640 --> 24:14.960
Another game from Activision, X-Men Destiny, which is kind of an X-Men themed brawler game.

24:14.960 --> 24:19.120
It's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

24:19.120 --> 24:26.600
Atelier Totri, The Adventurer of Arland, coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.

24:26.600 --> 24:31.400
Also on PC, Dragon Sang Complete Saga.

24:31.400 --> 24:38.800
On PS3, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, Classic Trilogy HD, re-release of some of those games

24:38.800 --> 24:40.920
in HD now.

24:40.920 --> 24:46.680
Child of Eden on PlayStation 3 this week, one of those games that does support 3D.

24:46.680 --> 24:52.520
Prevolution Soccer 2012, coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week, rest of the formats

24:52.520 --> 24:54.400
later on the year.

24:54.400 --> 24:59.440
Brunswick Pro Bowling 3DS for the Nintendo 3DS.

24:59.440 --> 25:04.440
Eco and Shadow Colossus Collection on PlayStation 3 finally making its way out this week, definitely

25:04.440 --> 25:05.440
a must-buy.

25:05.440 --> 25:15.840
FIFA Soccer 12 on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PSP, Xbox 360, 3DS, and the Wii.

25:15.840 --> 25:18.960
Of course, as I mentioned earlier, I believe the Wii is actually coming out later on.

25:18.960 --> 25:22.160
It's not supposed to be this week, I believe it's next week.

25:22.160 --> 25:29.680
Let's see here, Sulatorobo, Red the Hunter for Nintendo DS this week from XSeed.

25:29.680 --> 25:38.920
Air Conflict Secret Wars on Xbox 360, Driver San Francisco on PC, Touch and Play Collection

25:38.920 --> 25:42.800
for Nintendo DS, just kind of another mini-game collection.

25:42.800 --> 25:50.960
Sid Meier's Civ V, Game of the Year Edition on PC, and finally, one week from today, Tetris

25:50.960 --> 25:54.240
Axis on the 3DS.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.920
That's it for US, and then let's see here for Japan.

25:57.920 --> 26:01.280
I've got a few things coming out this week.

26:01.280 --> 26:08.040
Over there, Monster Hunter Frontier Online, the Forward 2 premier package coming out in

26:08.040 --> 26:10.320
Japan on Xbox 360.

26:10.320 --> 26:16.520
They also have a Monster Hunter console bundle over there, 250 gigabyte system, including

26:16.520 --> 26:19.800
an online trial pack.

26:19.800 --> 26:26.240
Game called Code 18 coming out over there in Japan, and looks like it may be another

26:26.240 --> 26:27.240
dating sim.

26:27.240 --> 26:33.720
That's from Cyber Front, yeah, definitely looks like a dating sim adventure game or

26:33.720 --> 26:35.720
something like that.

26:35.720 --> 26:39.000
Yeah, adventure game.

26:39.000 --> 26:46.040
Let's see, moving on, also we've got the collector's edition for the Monster Hunter Frontier Online

26:46.040 --> 26:52.440
Forward 2 premium package, and let's see, that's it for a 360.

26:52.440 --> 26:59.800
Moving on down here to PlayStation 3, I believe.

26:59.800 --> 27:04.880
We've got some weird games from Konami.

27:04.880 --> 27:11.480
Formula One 2011 in Japan, they're getting their release over there for that game.

27:11.480 --> 27:16.160
MLB Bobblehead, that's coming from Konami.

27:16.160 --> 27:26.880
Let's see here, Shin Sengoku Musou 6, that's coming out both regular and a premium box

27:26.880 --> 27:29.440
set as well.

27:29.440 --> 27:33.000
That's it for PlayStation 3.

27:33.000 --> 27:39.400
Next we've got, let's see here, nothing on the Vita yet, that would still be quite early

27:39.400 --> 27:41.400
for the Vita.

27:41.400 --> 27:54.400
PSP, a couple things on PSP, looks like Bullet Butlers coming out, Bullet Butlers from Boost

27:54.400 --> 27:58.080
On, that's coming out in both regular and limited edition.

27:58.080 --> 28:02.960
Also they're getting code 18 as well, regular and limited edition there.

28:02.960 --> 28:10.600
Dead End Orchestra Maneuvers in the Dead End, that's a weird title, that's coming out as

28:10.600 --> 28:13.680
well, regular and limited edition.

28:13.680 --> 28:17.840
Lots of stuff this week, let's see.

28:17.840 --> 28:30.240
Getting Iyu Densetsu Eo no Kiseki, that's both regular with a drama CD and limited edition

28:30.240 --> 28:31.240
as well.

28:31.240 --> 28:36.040
Evangelion Shin Genki Joban 3rd Impact.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.040
Oh great.

28:37.040 --> 28:43.320
More Eva Games, the series that will not die.

28:43.320 --> 28:50.280
Hakuisei Renee Shokoden, that's coming out as well.

28:50.280 --> 28:55.160
Man, lots of games this week on the PSP, I'm surprised.

28:55.160 --> 28:59.240
Holy crap, there's a ton of stuff.

28:59.240 --> 29:03.040
Let's see, also Neon Genesis Evangelion 3rd Impact.

29:03.040 --> 29:10.640
I'm assuming that's maybe a localized version, Asian version or something like that.

29:10.640 --> 29:18.040
Secret Game Portable, Yeti Best, that's coming out as well.

29:18.040 --> 29:27.240
And they're even doing a, I guess a branded memory stick duo or whatever for 3rd Impact.

29:27.240 --> 29:30.080
They love their Evangelion over there.

29:30.080 --> 29:41.440
And then finally, Wanda Fortune 2 and Tantei Buu Detective Club, that's coming out I guess

29:41.440 --> 29:42.440
as well.

29:42.440 --> 29:48.000
Lots of stuff on the PSP, which is kind of odd because in the US man, there's like maybe

29:48.000 --> 29:54.960
three titles this year left and that's it.

29:54.960 --> 30:01.600
And then on the Wii, not a whole lot, they're pretty much just getting that Biohazard Chronicles

30:01.600 --> 30:06.840
value pack, which is the Umbrella Chronicles and Dark Side Chronicles set, the two gun

30:06.840 --> 30:10.680
shooter games that they had, that's it for the Wii.

30:10.680 --> 30:27.640
And let's see, 3DS, few things, Hanatu Ikomo no Ritai Zukan, no idea what that is, but

30:27.640 --> 30:31.120
let's take a look here real quick.

30:31.120 --> 30:37.000
No idea what that is, looks like it has a butterfly on the cover.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.280
Maybe it's a bug collecting sim.

30:39.280 --> 30:45.880
Yeah, it's a bug collecting game.

30:45.880 --> 30:49.640
Bug collecting or maybe just photos or something, nature.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.040
Bird feeding, you collect the bugs and feed the birds.

30:52.040 --> 31:00.840
I think it's something about photography because it's showing they have stuff for shooting

31:00.840 --> 31:09.040
flowers and they've got a kind of like a collage, yeah it looks like just nature photos or something,

31:09.040 --> 31:14.760
some sort of, I don't know, very niche.

31:14.760 --> 31:22.520
And finally let's see Nintendo DS here, don't know if they've really got anything, oh actually

31:22.520 --> 31:27.480
it's kind of neat, they've got some re-releases on Playstation 2, Grand Theft Auto 3, Rock

31:27.480 --> 31:32.900
Stars Classic Edition, also San Andreas and Vice City Stories, all making their way out

31:32.900 --> 31:36.200
as well.

31:36.200 --> 31:47.040
Haru Kannaru Jinku no Kade 4, that's getting re-released as well.

31:47.040 --> 31:52.400
And Nintendo DS, nothing in Japan right now.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.400
Nintendo doesn't love you Japan.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.640
At least no DS's this week.

31:57.640 --> 32:04.400
Well how about we hop over a couple more oceans and get to Europe, sound good?

32:04.400 --> 32:06.920
In the UK, we have Stuff.

32:06.920 --> 32:13.720
On the 27th, Resident Evil Code Veronica X for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, Ico and Shadow

32:13.720 --> 32:21.960
of the Colossus Collection HD for PS3 on the 28th, also on the 28th Mercury HG, Roshard,

32:21.960 --> 32:28.640
The Binding of Isaac, Worms Ultimate Mayhem, Zelda Four Swords Anniversary Edition.

32:28.640 --> 32:34.640
On the 29th we have Katamari Amore on the iPhone, and on the 30th we have Game of Thrones

32:34.640 --> 32:45.240
Genesis, Child of Eden, Driver San Francisco, FIFA 12, We Sing UK Hits, and X-Men Destiny.

32:45.240 --> 32:48.240
That's pretty much it.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.240
Alright.

32:49.240 --> 32:51.920
You got anything else for us?

32:51.920 --> 32:54.520
Yeah, we've got some stuff here.

32:54.520 --> 32:58.840
Really, I think we should do the Classic Game of the Week.

32:58.840 --> 32:59.840
Really?

32:59.840 --> 33:00.840
Okay.

33:00.840 --> 33:01.840
Well then let's go ahead and do the Classic Game of the Week.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.840
As soon as I find the music.

33:03.840 --> 33:08.360
Since we're like, you know, flipping things around here and it's a very short show, might

33:08.360 --> 33:11.080
as well.

33:11.080 --> 33:20.920
Well then let's go ahead and get right into it.

33:20.920 --> 33:25.200
This is the Classic Game of the Week where I take you back in time in my TARDIS and show

33:25.200 --> 33:28.960
you games that you should have been playing, but did you play them?

33:28.960 --> 33:32.360
No, because you probably weren't born.

33:32.360 --> 33:35.040
Damn kids.

33:35.040 --> 33:41.920
Today's game is one called Quartet that anyone who actually is a fan of Project Diva might

33:41.920 --> 33:44.520
recognize the game.

33:44.520 --> 33:48.800
You know, Quartet came out in 1986 and it was an arcade game put out by Sega.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.840
You could have one to four players lead your characters through a base taken over by an

33:52.840 --> 33:54.080
army of robots.

33:54.080 --> 33:56.040
And it was set in the Fantasy Zone.

33:56.040 --> 34:01.080
As in Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier.

34:01.080 --> 34:05.160
In fact, Dan was telling me that Sega had this whole thing where their set of games

34:05.160 --> 34:08.720
back in the day were all set in the Fantasy Zone that they were going to say every one

34:08.720 --> 34:11.960
of their games were set there, but that didn't quite catch on.

34:11.960 --> 34:17.200
At any rate, you've got a character named Joe, Mary, Lee, or Edgar and you go through

34:17.200 --> 34:20.400
side-scrolling levels and you have to advance through the level and fight opponents that

34:20.400 --> 34:24.520
come out of portals in the walls and eventually defeat a boss that has the door case you can

34:24.520 --> 34:25.520
go to the next level.

34:25.520 --> 34:31.240
And you've got different power-ups like a jet pack and springs for jumping and boosting

34:31.240 --> 34:34.160
and different kinds of fun like that.

34:34.160 --> 34:38.440
So I'm going to go ahead and actually get the music playing since I didn't think about

34:38.440 --> 34:40.440
that so you can hear what it's like.

34:40.440 --> 34:45.920
I'm going to start it over so you can hear it from the beginning because this is actually

34:45.920 --> 34:51.160
one of the best pieces of gaming music ever.

34:51.160 --> 35:13.880
If it will play.

35:13.880 --> 35:17.560
This is from the Master System, so that's actually pretty good, but then again Master

35:17.560 --> 35:21.200
System games really did have a lot of great music.

35:21.200 --> 35:28.120
At any rate, you've got different weapon types, different orbs that will give you power-ups,

35:28.120 --> 35:32.760
but if it's another player's color, then it just gives you bonus points.

35:32.760 --> 35:36.680
And it came out around the same time as Gauntlet, sort of like I guess Sega's answer to Gauntlet.

35:36.680 --> 35:42.440
But it did come out on the Master System, but you could only play as Mary or Edgar and

35:42.440 --> 35:44.600
it was misspelled E-D-G-E-R.

35:44.600 --> 35:49.960
So it came out in Japan as Double Target, but over here it still came out as Quartet.

35:49.960 --> 35:53.440
There is also home versions.

35:53.440 --> 35:58.720
There were Commodore 64, Amstrad, CPC, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum.

35:58.720 --> 36:04.720
And the Okie Wrap and FM Funk music from the game were actually used later in the 1991

36:04.720 --> 36:06.680
Spider-Man video game.

36:06.680 --> 36:13.000
So Quartet 2 is an updated version that was done in a conversion kit that you could only

36:13.000 --> 36:16.640
play two players in the arcade one, but you could still select your characters.

36:16.640 --> 36:19.400
So that's the game of the week is Quartet.

36:19.400 --> 36:28.280
Now, I was mentioning that fans of Project D.Va should be able to recognize this song

36:28.280 --> 36:33.240
because a version of the song was used in Project D.Va 2nd.

36:33.240 --> 36:36.000
I know it was in Project D.Va Arcade, so I was going to play a little bit of that for

36:36.000 --> 36:42.160
you guys now, but if you stay tuned after this show, I'll play the whole thing.

36:42.160 --> 37:06.640
So here it goes.

37:06.640 --> 37:35.320
And that was the version from Project D.Va.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.960
Pretty cool, huh?

37:37.960 --> 37:38.960
Sure.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.960
What next?

37:40.960 --> 37:44.680
All right, let's move on along here.

37:44.680 --> 37:49.040
We've got a few more stories left.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.280
So let's see here.

37:50.280 --> 37:55.680
Since we were talking a little bit about Project D.Va, and it kind of reminds me of actually

37:55.680 --> 38:00.680
some of the Bahmani games, there's actually a new Bahmani, well, not technically a new

38:00.680 --> 38:04.200
Bahmani game, but a new game to the arcades, I should say.

38:04.200 --> 38:08.920
Dance Evolution, which was basically titled Dance Masters over here in the US, you may

38:08.920 --> 38:13.240
remember it as kind of the Kinect dancing game from Konami, that didn't really sell

38:13.240 --> 38:17.240
very well, but it was like Para, I guess.

38:17.240 --> 38:22.840
But now it is making full circle and going to the arcades, where they have an actual

38:22.840 --> 38:29.520
cabinet that's being location tested right now.

38:29.520 --> 38:37.820
And I love the first licensed song, because it does kind of sum up everything.

38:37.820 --> 38:47.520
So the first licensed song is Irony, Irony by Klarius, and a couple other Japanese songs,

38:47.520 --> 38:53.440
one from AKB48 and Morning Musume.

38:53.440 --> 38:58.960
And then of course, some of the Konami originals on the cabinet as well, Geisha's Dream by

38:58.960 --> 39:05.660
Naoki featuring Smell Decay, Into Your Heart, The Roughage Remix, Naoki featuring Yasmin,

39:05.660 --> 39:16.480
Keep on Movin' by NMR, Kimono Princess by Joon, My Summer Love by Mitsuo with Gala,

39:16.480 --> 39:24.920
and let's see, Open Your Eyes, Naoki Maida, featuring JB, and Still in My Heart by Naoki,

39:24.920 --> 39:28.440
and Unity by The Remembers.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.440
That's fun.

39:29.440 --> 39:33.840
We'd have to really do a lot of the upgrades to make it compete with just getting a home

39:33.840 --> 39:34.840
version.

39:34.840 --> 39:39.640
Well, it's basically, yeah, from the look of the cabinet, it's got a camera in there

39:39.640 --> 39:48.880
as well, and they didn't really show any sort of actual game stage, it's just basically

39:48.880 --> 39:53.840
the cabinet from the looks of it, and I'm thinking it's going to be very similar to

39:53.840 --> 39:58.560
how the home game played, it's basically just kind of in front of a camera.

39:58.560 --> 40:03.760
Unfortunately, they don't really have too much to go off of other than just a shot into

40:03.760 --> 40:07.280
the cabinet, which looks like it's just got an HD screen.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.720
They better have a lot of Eurobeat.

40:08.720 --> 40:10.000
That kind of stuff in there.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.520
Because honestly, that game just lends itself to Eurobeat.

40:12.520 --> 40:17.160
Yeah, I mean, looking at the screenshots, it looks just like a straight port of the

40:17.160 --> 40:22.200
game, so yeah, interesting I guess.

40:22.200 --> 40:27.480
I mean, I'd play it, and again, I like Dance Masters.

40:27.480 --> 40:35.520
I don't know if I would, but I just, it lacked some stuff as far as cues on what the hell

40:35.520 --> 40:36.520
to do.

40:36.520 --> 40:40.400
But I mean, if you're used to playing Para, I guess it's not too different, well, especially

40:40.400 --> 40:43.780
not too different if you're playing certain songs in the game, because the Para routines

40:43.780 --> 40:47.320
are basically the routines from the game.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.320
So yeah, I don't know.

40:49.320 --> 40:50.600
Well, that's still pretty neat.

40:50.600 --> 40:54.980
But I actually really want to see a machine before I pass judgment on it.

40:54.980 --> 40:59.040
So maybe we'll get one over here eventually.

40:59.040 --> 41:03.040
And in other news, now there is a game that I have mentioned to everybody before that's

41:03.040 --> 41:05.180
called Snatcher.

41:05.180 --> 41:12.880
And there was a radio drama called Dature, S-D-A-T-H-E-R, and the first two episodes

41:12.880 --> 41:15.020
of it have been translated.

41:15.020 --> 41:17.140
So that's actually pretty cool.

41:17.140 --> 41:23.700
And I will link that to the chat room so that anyone who is a Snatcher fan will be able

41:23.700 --> 41:26.520
to see it.

41:26.520 --> 41:32.800
I would actually just like for them to do another update of the game so I can play it

41:32.800 --> 41:33.800
again.

41:33.800 --> 41:38.520
Oh, maybe as soon as he finishes all the other damn projects he has on deck, like the Metal

41:38.520 --> 41:45.240
Gear Solid 3D game for 3DS that's still not out yet, or, oh, I don't know, the Metal Gear

41:45.240 --> 41:47.920
Rising game that's...

41:47.920 --> 41:52.520
I don't even know where the hell it happened with that game, I mean, it's maybe the end

41:52.520 --> 41:53.520
of the next year.

41:53.520 --> 41:58.960
And then of course he has his new Fox engine that he's working on games for, so it could

41:58.960 --> 42:02.120
be a while.

42:02.120 --> 42:09.160
Well, I would very much like to, see, that's the problem with talented people that get

42:09.160 --> 42:14.200
too much on their plate, is they don't get the right stuff on their plate, at least to

42:14.200 --> 42:15.200
come out anyway.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.080
Yes, I agree, Zeether, Snatcher kicks ass.

42:18.080 --> 42:24.800
I've actually got Snatcher for PS1, but of course it's all in Japanese, and my husband

42:24.800 --> 42:26.800
lost patience with it really quickly.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.560
But who knows.

42:28.560 --> 42:35.220
So let's go ahead and open up Ye Olde Skypline, I will change this to online.

42:35.220 --> 42:46.500
You can give us a call, our number is 1-866-877-GAME-OLR, and you will be live on air and we can embarrass

42:46.500 --> 42:48.840
the crap out of you.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.560
Ooh!

42:50.560 --> 42:51.560
Are you afraid?

42:51.560 --> 42:59.800
While we're waiting for calls to come in, just gonna read a couple other things, a third

42:59.800 --> 43:03.120
round of songs have been announced for D&D Revolution 2, in case you're interested in

43:03.120 --> 43:08.200
picking up the Wii version, I'm glad to see that DM Ashura is still getting work, he has

43:08.200 --> 43:15.680
a song in there called Aftershock, also of course Kay with Dirty Digital, Dummy by Ram,

43:15.680 --> 43:26.340
In Love With You, Kotaru featuring Aya, Sakura Storm by Ryu Star, also Delta Max by DM Ashura

43:26.340 --> 43:27.680
as well.

43:27.680 --> 43:35.320
It's really funny seeing all the old Bomani, DWI, step mania artists getting songs into

43:35.320 --> 43:36.960
these games nowadays.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.960
He said DWI.

43:38.960 --> 43:46.440
Yeah, fans with intensity stuff, it's old school, John's not old school.

43:46.440 --> 43:52.080
Well looks like no one's, oh we just got a caller, so I will go ahead and pick this up.

43:52.080 --> 43:55.360
Hello, you've reached OLR, who's this?

43:55.360 --> 43:57.640
Hi, it's CD Thunder.

43:57.640 --> 44:01.280
Hello CD Thunder, and a happy belated birthday to you.

44:01.280 --> 44:02.280
Thank you very much.

44:02.280 --> 44:05.360
Welcome, so what's up, what's on your mind?

44:05.360 --> 44:10.920
Not too much, just have a couple things to discuss.

44:10.920 --> 44:13.480
Okay.

44:13.480 --> 44:19.200
First thing is, I'd like to talk about one of my favorite video game characters of all

44:19.200 --> 44:20.200
time.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.200
And who is that?

44:21.200 --> 44:22.200
Mario.

44:22.200 --> 44:23.200
Oh.

44:23.200 --> 44:26.920
So why is Mario your favorite?

44:26.920 --> 44:27.920
It's one of my favorites.

44:27.920 --> 44:29.240
One of your favorites, okay.

44:29.240 --> 44:31.760
So what do you want to say about Mario?

44:31.760 --> 44:36.840
Well the reason I like Mario is because I really like his outfit.

44:36.840 --> 44:43.920
I love his hat and everything he can do with the fire flowers and all that stuff.

44:43.920 --> 44:48.760
Is the fire flower your favorite power up for him?

44:48.760 --> 44:52.160
For me it's the tanooki suit.

44:52.160 --> 44:57.080
It would be the fire flower and that feather that gives him the cape.

44:57.080 --> 44:58.080
Yeah.

44:58.080 --> 45:02.800
I'm actually really a fan of Pull's boot, not Pull's voice, I'm thinking of the little

45:02.800 --> 45:03.800
boot thing.

45:03.800 --> 45:04.800
The kuberu shoe.

45:04.800 --> 45:05.800
Kuberu, thank you.

45:05.800 --> 45:08.480
I don't think I've seen that before, actually.

45:08.480 --> 45:10.680
That's in Super Mario Brothers 3.

45:10.680 --> 45:11.680
Oh.

45:11.680 --> 45:17.200
Well, I, yeah, I mean, I haven't played many of the games.

45:17.200 --> 45:23.840
I mean, I play like Super Mario, the new Super Mario Brothers for the DS and a lot of others,

45:23.840 --> 45:29.120
but I just like everything about him.

45:29.120 --> 45:30.360
That's cool.

45:30.360 --> 45:34.800
So you said there were a couple of things you wanted to talk about, what was the other?

45:34.800 --> 45:37.800
The other one is, I want to talk about prototype.

45:37.800 --> 45:38.800
Prototype, okay.

45:38.800 --> 45:44.560
What I like about that is you're a guy who's basically a human weapon.

45:44.560 --> 45:48.800
You can do pretty much everything.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.440
So like, you could blow up the earth if you wanted to?

45:51.440 --> 45:55.360
What did you say?

45:55.360 --> 45:57.520
You could blow up the earth if you wanted to?

45:57.520 --> 46:03.880
Well, maybe, but I like how you can, what is it called?

46:03.880 --> 46:07.440
You can, yeah, you consume other people and you can actually turn them to them if you

46:07.440 --> 46:10.560
need to, to sneak around places.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.320
That sounds like episodes of Supernatural.

46:12.320 --> 46:15.800
Now are you looking forward to the sequel coming out next year?

46:15.800 --> 46:17.520
Prototype 2?

46:17.520 --> 46:26.040
I haven't actually seen anything about that, so I'm not sure what I feel on that yet.

46:26.040 --> 46:32.320
And what you basically do with your character is a lot of free running, the parkour stuff,

46:32.320 --> 46:38.080
because you can run up the walls and do flips and all that type of thing.

46:38.080 --> 46:40.080
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

46:40.080 --> 46:41.080
I didn't ever play it.

46:41.080 --> 46:42.080
Oh really?

46:42.080 --> 46:43.080
Yeah.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.080
I wasn't too busy playing WoW.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.080
Addicts?

46:45.080 --> 46:51.560
Rob's my dealer and I can't yell at him.

46:51.560 --> 46:55.720
I just wanted to see what you guys thought of Mario.

46:55.720 --> 46:58.320
What are your opinions on him?

46:58.320 --> 46:59.320
Iconic.

46:59.320 --> 47:03.360
That's all I can say.

47:03.360 --> 47:04.720
That's a good character, I guess.

47:04.720 --> 47:07.720
Good franchise for Nintendo.

47:07.720 --> 47:13.240
Well, yeah, that was pretty much all I wanted to call in about.

47:13.240 --> 47:17.360
And yeah, birthday was yesterday and I turned 19.

47:17.360 --> 47:18.360
Party time!

47:18.360 --> 47:19.360
Happy birthday!

47:19.360 --> 47:21.120
You're only two years away from the big party.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.520
Yeah, I know.

47:22.520 --> 47:23.520
It's scary.

47:23.520 --> 47:24.520
Well, you have a good one.

47:24.520 --> 47:25.520
Thanks for calling in.

47:25.520 --> 47:26.520
Uh huh.

47:26.520 --> 47:27.520
Bye.

47:27.520 --> 47:28.520
Bye bye.

47:28.520 --> 47:32.240
So, any other callers want to give us a call?

47:32.240 --> 47:38.120
You can call us at 877-GAME-OLR or reach us on Skype or Orange Lounge Radio.

47:38.120 --> 47:39.120
Please call.

47:39.120 --> 47:42.520
While we're waiting for more calls here.

47:42.520 --> 47:48.200
Kind of neat, Assassin's Creed, one of those games now that they're going to be adding

47:48.200 --> 47:52.560
more content to the Playstation 3 version in the form of an older game.

47:52.560 --> 47:56.600
Kind of like how Bioshock Infinite's going to have the original Bioshock in there.

47:56.600 --> 48:00.800
Assassin's Creed Revelations is going to have the original Assassin's Creed on the same

48:00.800 --> 48:04.520
disc because, you know, hey, the game doesn't use up all the blu-ray space and they can

48:04.520 --> 48:05.520
do that.

48:05.520 --> 48:09.520
And unfortunately they haven't really done anything to the original game as far as adding

48:09.520 --> 48:13.000
trophy support or anything like that, but hey, you get another game in case, you know,

48:13.000 --> 48:15.200
maybe you don't have the first Assassin's Creed.

48:15.200 --> 48:17.200
I don't know.

48:17.200 --> 48:19.080
Neat, I guess.

48:19.080 --> 48:25.200
Also, I was going to mention Final Fantasy XIV is actually getting some updates.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.200
We have a call.

48:26.200 --> 48:27.200
Can we hold that one for after?

48:27.200 --> 48:28.200
Sure.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.200
Okay.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.200
Hello, thank you for calling Orange Lounge Radio.

48:30.200 --> 48:31.200
Who is this?

48:31.200 --> 48:32.200
This is Kaijuto.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.200
Can you hear me?

48:33.200 --> 48:34.200
Yes, we can.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.200
Hi, Kaijuto.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.200
Long time no talk.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.200
Hey, what's up?

48:37.200 --> 48:38.200
This is what I was thinking.

48:38.200 --> 48:41.920
Really don't know what to talk about, but your last caller, he was talking about Mario

48:41.920 --> 48:43.720
and it made me think about something.

48:43.720 --> 48:46.640
Why the hell doesn't Mario have a kid yet?

48:46.640 --> 48:48.640
Like how old is he by now?

48:48.640 --> 48:49.640
About 40, 50?

48:49.640 --> 48:54.720
Yeah, but they say that sometimes obesity affects fertility.

48:54.720 --> 48:56.960
Ah.

48:56.960 --> 49:03.040
God maybe he seems to be a very well, maybe fungus people and humans aren't compatible.

49:03.040 --> 49:04.480
Yeah, maybe so.

49:04.480 --> 49:08.480
Yeah, I forgot that Princess Peach isn't necessarily from this dimension.

49:08.480 --> 49:15.920
Either that or she's produced spores, but they mutated and turned into goombas.

49:15.920 --> 49:21.480
And I don't know, I guess the next thing I'll talk about is games I'm looking forward to.

49:21.480 --> 49:25.760
I've been going over my game list, like what I plan on buying, and I just realized that

49:25.760 --> 49:29.400
I don't think I'm buying anything for the Xbox 360 for the rest of this year.

49:29.400 --> 49:30.400
Really?

49:30.400 --> 49:34.600
Yeah, I think everything that I'm buying is basically going to be for PlayStation 3.

49:34.600 --> 49:40.720
Battlefield 3, I'm getting for PlayStation 3 just because it's like single disc and your

49:40.720 --> 49:42.440
promise there's...

49:42.440 --> 49:45.400
Uh oh, sorry.

49:45.400 --> 49:49.400
Give us a call back, sorry.

49:49.400 --> 49:50.400
Alright.

49:50.400 --> 49:53.520
What was that?

49:53.520 --> 49:57.000
Definitely picked up a call by accident, so my bad.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
Okay.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.800
I'm going to try to call, um, ah.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.680
Yeah, this is ghetto ass broken radio.

50:05.680 --> 50:10.640
Sorry, I didn't mean, I called you again by accident, we're going to have Rob edit this

50:10.640 --> 50:11.640
out.

50:11.640 --> 50:12.960
I will call you back as soon as this call is over.

50:12.960 --> 50:13.960
How's that?

50:13.960 --> 50:14.960
Alright.

50:14.960 --> 50:17.960
Okay, thank you.

50:17.960 --> 50:24.800
Okay, now I'm trying to figure out how to accept the call again.

50:24.800 --> 50:25.800
Resume call.

50:25.800 --> 50:26.800
Hi, sorry.

50:26.800 --> 50:27.800
Are you, are you there?

50:27.800 --> 50:28.800
Do you have me here?

50:28.800 --> 50:29.800
Do you hear me?

50:29.800 --> 50:30.800
I'm so sorry.

50:30.800 --> 50:39.520
Um, I, we got another caller pop up and accidentally hit the answer button so it put you on hold.

50:39.520 --> 50:40.520
Yeah.

50:40.520 --> 50:41.520
No problem.

50:41.520 --> 50:44.560
So, my apologies, I'm normally not the one that handles the Skype line as you can tell.

50:44.560 --> 50:47.400
Yeah, I'm getting like double talk now.

50:47.400 --> 50:48.400
Oh, fun.

50:48.400 --> 50:49.400
Well.

50:49.400 --> 50:50.400
Oh, wait a second.

50:50.400 --> 50:51.400
Alright, there it is.

50:51.400 --> 50:52.400
Okay.

50:52.400 --> 50:53.400
I turned down, turned down my computer.

50:53.400 --> 50:54.400
That would help.

50:54.400 --> 50:55.400
Yeah.

50:55.400 --> 50:56.400
So, I'm sorry, what were you saying?

50:56.400 --> 50:59.320
Anyway, yes, so I mean, every game that I'm getting is pretty much going to be for PS3,

50:59.320 --> 51:01.360
I just realized that, so.

51:01.360 --> 51:03.160
I don't know, I don't think I'm the only one.

51:03.160 --> 51:07.560
I think maybe, ah, 2012 is going to be the year of PS3 maybe.

51:07.560 --> 51:11.240
Well, it seems like it's about time they did something right, huh?

51:11.240 --> 51:12.240
Yeah.

51:12.240 --> 51:13.240
It's about time.

51:13.240 --> 51:16.640
Well, you know, it's like we said, the system's only as good as the games that are on it.

51:16.640 --> 51:17.640
Yeah, that's true.

51:17.640 --> 51:18.640
Yep.

51:18.640 --> 51:19.640
Yep.

51:19.640 --> 51:20.640
Alrighty.

51:20.640 --> 51:21.640
Well.

51:21.640 --> 51:22.640
Goodnight.

51:22.640 --> 51:23.640
Alright, sorry for the mix-up.

51:23.640 --> 51:24.640
Yeah, it's no problem.

51:24.640 --> 51:25.640
Okay, buh-bye.

51:25.640 --> 51:34.720
Okay, now, um, I will try to get a hold of Zither again, who was calling and I was being

51:34.720 --> 51:35.720
a derp.

51:35.720 --> 51:39.200
Hello, Zither, are you there?

51:39.200 --> 51:42.640
Hi, it's Zither from the chat.

51:42.640 --> 51:43.640
Hello.

51:43.640 --> 51:49.000
Um, I was thinking of something to call about and I finally thought of something, um, you've

51:49.000 --> 51:50.800
heard of Retro Game Challenge, right?

51:50.800 --> 51:52.800
The DS game?

51:52.800 --> 51:53.800
Yeah.

51:53.800 --> 51:59.600
The, um, I've been watching the show that it's based on, Game Center CX, and it is awesome.

51:59.600 --> 52:03.560
It is just one of the best things I've ever watched, one of the best Japanese television

52:03.560 --> 52:04.560
shows I have ever watched.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.760
So what do you like about it?

52:06.760 --> 52:11.360
Um, it's really fun to watch because it has this guy struggling to get through the games

52:11.360 --> 52:17.840
to get to the end and it's just, it's just cool watching him constantly try to make it

52:17.840 --> 52:24.320
through and spending out these hours planning things out and getting through it.

52:24.320 --> 52:25.320
That sounds pretty cool.

52:25.320 --> 52:27.240
So it's just, you like the struggle.

52:27.240 --> 52:31.640
Yeah, it's, it's very, they make it like overly dramatic sometimes.

52:31.640 --> 52:36.000
Like, he'll be at like this impasse and they'll be like, and they'll be like, oh, how is he

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
going to get through this?

52:37.000 --> 52:39.640
Is he going to be able to beat this enemy that's giving him trouble?

52:39.640 --> 52:45.160
Like in one episode he was doing ghosts and goblins and the red demon was constantly giving

52:45.160 --> 52:49.400
him hell and it was like, how is he going to get past this guy?

52:49.400 --> 52:51.280
He's stuck in game over hell.

52:51.280 --> 52:56.760
Oh, that I can imagine too, because like that last level is especially crappy with the red

52:56.760 --> 52:57.760
demon.

52:57.760 --> 52:58.760
Oh yeah.

52:58.760 --> 53:01.440
And when he found out he had to do it all over again, he was like, I'm not going to

53:01.440 --> 53:02.440
do this.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.940
I'm going to just hand it over to one of the other guys.

53:03.940 --> 53:04.940
He's going to do it.

53:04.940 --> 53:05.940
It's.

53:05.940 --> 53:06.940
Oh yeah.

53:06.940 --> 53:09.720
He's going to beat the game and then it's like, no, go back.

53:09.720 --> 53:11.840
No, you have to do it again.

53:11.840 --> 53:14.880
That was, that game was like one of the ultimate in rage quits.

53:14.880 --> 53:16.860
Yeah, it's definitely.

53:16.860 --> 53:21.460
And um, he actually, I actually found out that the guy who was on, the guy who did,

53:21.460 --> 53:25.840
the guy on the show who does the games, playing the games, his name is Arino.

53:25.840 --> 53:31.840
He was actually in um, California at one point that like a couple of weeks ago he was doing

53:31.840 --> 53:38.940
a special tape special that was going to be him going to the U S and, and a lot of people

53:38.940 --> 53:40.080
showed up.

53:40.080 --> 53:42.600
That's pretty cool.

53:42.600 --> 53:43.600
Yeah.

53:43.600 --> 53:46.900
The retro game challenge game is also extremely fun.

53:46.900 --> 53:50.000
It's definitely one of my favorite DS games.

53:50.000 --> 53:54.840
I might have to check that out given, you know, my husband and I are like the huge game,

53:54.840 --> 53:56.200
old school game people.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.240
It's very good.

53:57.240 --> 54:00.280
It's got some, it's got some really, really good games in it.

54:00.280 --> 54:03.980
The sequel didn't come out here, but there's actually a group that's working on a fan translation

54:03.980 --> 54:04.980
for it.

54:04.980 --> 54:08.720
And so far from what I can tell, it looks pretty close to what we got here for the first

54:08.720 --> 54:09.720
game.

54:09.720 --> 54:11.720
That sounds awesome.

54:11.720 --> 54:13.080
Yeah.

54:13.080 --> 54:15.520
And uh, yeah, Snatcher, really good game.

54:15.520 --> 54:17.000
Snatcher is fantastic.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.360
I've still been trying to find a Sega CD copy.

54:19.360 --> 54:21.600
Oh yeah, it's really hard to find it.

54:21.600 --> 54:24.760
I've just had to emulate, but it's, it's really good.

54:24.760 --> 54:26.960
I, I really like it.

54:26.960 --> 54:27.960
The plot is great.

54:27.960 --> 54:32.800
I still, I need to get back to it because I've gotten pretty far into the, pretty decently

54:32.800 --> 54:35.200
far into the game, but it's really good.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.200
I like the music.

54:36.200 --> 54:38.480
I like the voice, the voice acting.

54:38.480 --> 54:42.280
It's very, very well done for a game that's from like the early nineties.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.920
The little Metal Gear cameo.

54:43.920 --> 54:46.440
Yes, Metal Gear walking around.

54:46.440 --> 54:52.640
I especially liked, um, the club, the Outer Heaven Club and when you were, when you went

54:52.640 --> 54:57.000
there, you got to pick a mask and I picked the Moai head and there was all the Konami

54:57.000 --> 55:03.000
characters there and, um, who was it, um, Gillian was like, I don't know if we fit in

55:03.000 --> 55:05.520
and Metal Gear is like, I think we fit in more than you think.

55:05.520 --> 55:08.960
And I kind of caught that subtle Gradius reference.

55:08.960 --> 55:10.400
Very, very cool.

55:10.400 --> 55:12.000
Yeah, that's super neat.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.560
Well, pretty cool.

55:13.560 --> 55:16.040
So you got anything else for us?

55:16.040 --> 55:17.200
No, nothing else.

55:17.200 --> 55:18.200
All right.

55:18.200 --> 55:21.120
Well, I'm sorry that I hung up on you earlier.

55:21.120 --> 55:22.120
It's all right.

55:22.120 --> 55:25.440
I attribute that to derp because it's the derpisode.

55:25.440 --> 55:27.160
It's mad buggy.

55:27.160 --> 55:29.480
Bug report.

55:29.480 --> 55:30.480
All right.

55:30.480 --> 55:31.480
All right.

55:31.480 --> 55:32.480
Later.

55:32.480 --> 55:33.480
Later.

55:33.480 --> 55:34.480
All right guys.

55:34.480 --> 55:35.480
You can give us a call.

55:35.480 --> 55:36.800
We'll take one more call.

55:36.800 --> 55:41.440
It's a eight seven seven game O L R. Do you have any other last minute stories for us?

55:41.440 --> 55:42.440
Yeah.

55:42.440 --> 55:43.440
I was going to finish up real quick.

55:43.440 --> 55:44.440
Yeah, that's right.

55:44.440 --> 55:45.440
The yeah.

55:45.440 --> 55:46.440
Yeah.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.440
Final Fantasy 14, you know, they didn't really fix the game yet all the way, but they did

55:48.440 --> 55:54.020
add chocobos and uh, you can get a three, they have three different chocobos stables

55:54.020 --> 55:59.400
in the game, um, which you can eat your very own chocobo whistle and you can ride chocobos

55:59.400 --> 56:01.140
pretty much anywhere in the game.

56:01.140 --> 56:06.720
Also they have added materia so you can add materia and augment your weapons as well.

56:06.720 --> 56:12.920
And then finally airships, um, have been added into the game as well so that you can actually

56:12.920 --> 56:14.480
ride across everything.

56:14.480 --> 56:15.480
I don't know.

56:15.480 --> 56:19.480
It's just really, you didn't have chocobos or airships in this game.

56:19.480 --> 56:21.280
I mean you had it in 11.

56:21.280 --> 56:24.960
Why is, should this be any different considering that you're reusing everything anyways?

56:24.960 --> 56:27.280
Well, we got another call in.

56:27.280 --> 56:29.640
This is the last call of the night.

56:29.640 --> 56:30.640
Hello.

56:30.640 --> 56:31.640
You have reached orange launch radio.

56:31.640 --> 56:32.640
Who is this?

56:32.640 --> 56:34.480
Yo, it's Xenocore from the LKC.

56:34.480 --> 56:35.480
How y'all doing?

56:35.480 --> 56:36.480
Doing good.

56:36.480 --> 56:37.480
How are you Xenocore?

56:37.480 --> 56:38.760
Uh, well rested from my trip.

56:38.760 --> 56:43.280
I think you might've heard a bit when I spoke on Bobby, but yeah, driving to Florida and

56:43.280 --> 56:45.000
back is no fun.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.520
Uh, that doesn't sound like fun at all.

56:47.520 --> 56:48.520
Yeah.

56:48.520 --> 56:52.680
Especially when it's just for family duties, not a real vacation, but anyway, we're here

56:52.680 --> 56:53.680
about games.

56:53.680 --> 56:54.680
Yep.

56:54.680 --> 56:55.680
So what is up?

56:55.680 --> 56:57.080
Uh, not much.

56:57.080 --> 57:02.360
I did want to include a small thing, uh, on top of, you know, uh, Arino playing old school

57:02.360 --> 57:03.840
games on Game Center CX.

57:03.840 --> 57:07.160
He also does do interviews with some of the game makers in Japan.

57:07.160 --> 57:10.160
He's already talked to the guys in charge of Castlevania.

57:10.160 --> 57:13.720
He talked to Kojima about Metal Gear and its history and other things like that.

57:13.720 --> 57:17.660
There's a lot of stuff that, like for instance, Kotaku is covering the gaming that he's doing

57:17.660 --> 57:21.640
and doing some awful voiceover on some of the stuff.

57:21.640 --> 57:27.280
But there's an account on, uh, YouTube that somebody has been putting all the fan subs

57:27.280 --> 57:29.360
that have been done online.

57:29.360 --> 57:33.440
And I put a link to one of them in chat, but, uh, they've got over 24 of the episodes already,

57:33.440 --> 57:37.400
including the one where he went to Korea and talked to some gamers over there as well.

57:37.400 --> 57:39.860
It is really an outstanding show.

57:39.860 --> 57:42.900
I'm going to have to check that out as, I mean, it sounds like something totally up

57:42.900 --> 57:43.900
my alley.

57:43.900 --> 57:47.640
I just had never, I mean, I've heard of it before, but I haven't ever seen any.

57:47.640 --> 57:48.640
Yeah.

57:48.640 --> 57:52.840
Right around 903 in chat, if you take that link, that'll give you the account name.

57:52.840 --> 57:56.400
I think it's like active circle or something like that, but he's putting all that stuff

57:56.400 --> 57:57.400
on there.

57:57.400 --> 57:58.400
You can give it a go.

57:58.400 --> 58:07.600
And, uh, the other thing, um, I'm still curious as to whether or not I should, as much as

58:07.600 --> 58:13.400
I love Space Marine, I've heard rumors that the multiplayer population has already died

58:13.400 --> 58:14.400
out.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.400
Really?

58:15.400 --> 58:16.400
It's kind of sucks.

58:16.400 --> 58:17.720
I'm not sure if that's accurate or not.

58:17.720 --> 58:21.960
I mean, it's probably just fanboys complaining, but I hope not because that game was awesome

58:21.960 --> 58:24.400
and I, I played it from game fly.

58:24.400 --> 58:27.920
I do want to get a full version of it, but I'm not going to do it if the multiplayer

58:27.920 --> 58:28.920
isn't there.

58:28.920 --> 58:30.200
Cause that's the only thing that's left in there for me.

58:30.200 --> 58:31.200
Yeah.

58:31.200 --> 58:34.200
Well, I mean, if the game doesn't give you what you want, what's the point, right?

58:34.200 --> 58:38.560
Well, it gave me everything I wanted, but it was a multi, the single player, you know,

58:38.560 --> 58:41.040
once you go through that, you pretty much know it as fun as it is.

58:41.040 --> 58:44.800
I'm not the kind of guy that can just do that repeatedly and get enjoyment out of it.

58:44.800 --> 58:45.800
So yeah.

58:45.800 --> 58:50.360
But, uh, I hope, I hope they make another one cause that was an outstanding representation

58:50.360 --> 58:51.880
of what to do with that franchise.

58:51.880 --> 58:54.240
So they can keep her fingers crossed, right?

58:54.240 --> 58:55.240
Mm hmm.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.240
Offer a little prayer.

58:56.240 --> 58:57.240
Yup.

58:57.240 --> 58:58.240
Yup.

58:58.240 --> 59:01.880
But, uh, awesome job today, guys, uh, sky isn't missing the thing.

59:01.880 --> 59:02.880
So good job.

59:02.880 --> 59:06.420
He actually just texted that he made it to San Francisco and I was going to reply that

59:06.420 --> 59:10.000
I'm hateful and jealous, but nah, that's okay.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.920
He has to stay in there and the audience with the rest of the granted lady Tron's playing,

59:13.920 --> 59:16.020
but he's going to get, you know, funk right all over him.

59:16.020 --> 59:21.880
So you know, yeah, he's going to come back smelling like pot and then he's going to get

59:21.880 --> 59:22.880
sick.

59:22.880 --> 59:23.880
No, I'm kidding.

59:23.880 --> 59:24.880
All right.

59:24.880 --> 59:25.880
Well thank you for calling.

59:25.880 --> 59:26.880
Did you have anything else?

59:26.880 --> 59:27.880
No, that's pretty much it.

59:27.880 --> 59:28.880
Pretty light today.

59:28.880 --> 59:29.880
So alrighty.

59:29.880 --> 59:31.880
Well you take care and we will hear from you next week maybe.

59:31.880 --> 59:36.300
Oh, hopefully next week we actually have a special guest on the show.

59:36.300 --> 59:37.300
Another host.

59:37.300 --> 59:38.300
It's Dan.

59:38.300 --> 59:39.300
So I guess he's not that special.

59:39.300 --> 59:41.700
I mean he's special, special to me.

59:41.700 --> 59:43.280
Just a little bit special.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.280
Just special.

59:44.280 --> 59:45.280
Okay.

59:45.280 --> 59:46.280
Bye bye.

59:46.280 --> 59:47.280
All right.

59:47.280 --> 59:48.280
Later.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.280
All right.

59:49.280 --> 59:52.560
That was our last call of the night and sorry anyone else who was trying to get in because

59:52.560 --> 59:56.800
believe it or not, we did have people trying to get in, but nope, that was it.

59:56.800 --> 59:59.680
And I actually do have another story.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:08.480
Just a little story that came to us courtesy, courtesy, courtesy of a tiger claw and that's

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:14.180
that Microsoft is allowing a small number of mistakenly banned Xbox 360 players back

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.360
on Xbox Live.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:23.140
So they actually, Steven Toulouse wrote a blog about that some of the suspensions were

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:27.360
mistakenly made by different software being used and so they are bringing those people

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.560
back there and banning them and will give them a free three month subscription to Xbox

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.600
Live Gold and 1600 Microsoft Points.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:40.160
And they said it was very specific issue and it happened between August 29th and September

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.160
9th.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.120
So they've got it lined up.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:49.280
So I guess that's nice of them saying, oh, we screwed up here.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.760
Do you have anything else for us?

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.080
Just one thing real quick and it's more of a PSA than anything.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.080
All right.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:03.340
Remember we talked, well, I talked about the Tommy Wee Show that I guess is something that's

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:09.040
running from Makima on YouTube and stuff like that.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:16.780
Well, they had the first episode featuring Tommy with so and it is fucking stupid.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:20.440
First off, it's a rip off of Mr. Science Theory 3000.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:27.000
Secondly, Tommy with so cannot form English sentences.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.280
He's just, it's just so fucking stupid.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.880
And the only humor that you'd find in this is that he's really stupid.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:40.880
So I mean, if you like watching stupid people play games, I'm sure there's plenty of videos

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:46.920
out there on the Internet of people playing games, but it is seriously a rip off of Mr.

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.520
Science Theory 3000 straight up to the set, to the logo, to everything.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.520
Wow.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.520
That's just.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:57.260
And it's not even to the fact that he's mocking a game being played.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:02.960
It's him playing a game while this alien's mocking him.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.280
And I mean, at one point he accidentally hits the PlayStation button and it goes to the

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:12.720
cross menu bar and he's just, how do I get out of this?

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.160
I mean, it's dumb, so please don't watch it.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.440
Just let it die in a fire.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.440
Lame.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:25.600
Well, that's it for OLR, but I'm actually going to go ahead and play, um, oh, actually,

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600
you know what?

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.600
So never mind.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.840
I'm not going to play anything, but I'm going to give everyone a little bitty tip.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.840
Stay tuned after the show and you will hear a blast from the past in the form of a modified

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.360
pump up the volume.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.960
So, uh, do you have any final thoughts?

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.960
Uh, no.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.960
Yeah.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.880
I don't have any either except that I'm just going to do some music for about an hour so

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.120
that you guys don't feel like we've gone, oh, don't want to.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.120
Okay.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.120
So anyway, thank you for listening.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:57.320
