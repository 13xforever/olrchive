00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,200
Tonight, September 4th, 2011, a former QA tester sues one developer.

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,420
Details on Dragon Quest X are soon to be revealed.

3
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:32,120
Will there soon be a museum dedicated to video games?

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,280
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of that show

5
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,440
where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,360
Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
We are live.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,680
It is Sunday, September the 4th of 2011.

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,240
It's Labor Day weekend and we're live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com where we are

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,920
live every week at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show,

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
although not tonight.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
He had the night off.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,640
He's at Dragon Con and I know he's going to have a full report on all of that next week.

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,720
In the meantime, let me introduce who we have here in studio.

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,000
My name is Rob Roberts and not joining me tonight, sadly.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,760
I know this might come as a surprise, but Dark Sakura is not here.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
She has the night off.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,880
She's in San Francisco.

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,020
If you guys know Maren from Las Vegas, she's in town visiting San Francisco.

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,680
So they're doing girly things in the city like going to have shrimp at Pier 39 and then

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,240
pillow fights and braiding each other's hair and chocolate sundaes and all that.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,320
So filling in tonight as hosts, we have a guest who used to come to the show all the

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,040
time then has been taking a little break.

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,520
So say hello, welcome back, whatever the case may be to Salacious Pop.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Hello.

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,680
How are you doing tonight Salacious Pop?

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm doing great.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
So, okay, for the listeners that don't know you, well, let me introduce, I'll come back

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,340
to you in a minute, but also it just wouldn't be a night at OLR without the one and only

30
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,340
tech master, Loki.

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Hello.

32
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,340
And everyone was wrong.

33
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,180
It was a big, and Loki, oh my gosh, we're having so much feeling that you're not plugged

34
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,180
in tonight.

35
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,180
Loki.

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,760
We're having a little bit of fail tonight and I'll get to that in a minute.

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,760
I'm sure everybody's like tonight.

38
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
What is that?

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Every night you have all our fail.

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Okay.

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Try again.

42
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Look.

43
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
All right.

44
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Tech master Loki.

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
And everybody had it wrong.

46
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
It wasn't anything.

47
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
It wasn't double bacon strips.

48
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,640
It was a double Western bacon cheeseburger from Carl's Jr or Hardee's I guess on the

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,680
East coast.

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,080
And he is talking to chat.orangelandtrader.com, our live chat room where we are live every

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
week.

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,680
Come join us sometime for a live show.

53
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,520
Although I will say tonight was, you know, usually the podcast people are like, man,

54
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,640
we get shafted because the live listeners, they get the music breaks and the live listeners

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,000
get that little bonus segment at the very end that isn't on the podcast and so on.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,240
Live listeners make out well tonight, podcast listeners, you got the better end of the deal

57
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,280
because we are 25 minutes late and starting tonight and the live listeners have been waiting.

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,920
It's a very struggling evening.

59
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Yes.

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,920
And we've just had tech.

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
We've had tech fail.

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,000
We've had can't get into the studio when Jamie's not here fail.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,200
We've just had all sorts of problems.

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,920
So I apologize, but, um, we'll find our rhythm eventually and, and put on a show.

65
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,360
So Dan is yelling at us in the living room to quit complaining.

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,680
So anyway, uh, let's go back to Salacious Pop and, um, you're here, but you haven't

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
been here a little while.

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,080
When was the last time you were on the show?

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,300
I want to say it was either April or before.

70
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,880
I think it's kind of funny that, uh, now that I actually live up in Sacramento where Studio

71
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:20,340
OLR is roughly, um, I'm on the show far less than I was before, even though I'm living

72
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,480
with one of the co-hosts.

73
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,320
So for those that are new to Orange Lawn Radio, maybe haven't heard you on the show before,

74
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,960
tell us a little bit about yourself.

75
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,840
Like what, what kind of games are you into?

76
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
What do you like?

77
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,940
Uh, I've been gaming since I was four or five.

78
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,880
My first system was an Atari 2600.

79
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,240
Um, most of my gaming was probably done during the SNES and PS1 generations.

80
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,640
I own all the systems and have a ton of games, but I don't really console game much anymore.

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm mostly a PC gamer.

82
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,120
I mostly, I'm more into gaming culture.

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,920
Um, those are my people, but as far as actually sitting down when we'll get to this, when

84
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,660
we get to my, um, gaming week, don't really play as much as I used to.

85
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,320
What do you mean by like gaming culture and those are my people when you say that?

86
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,520
Just the various fandoms and, you know, following the sort of, you know, I still follow the

87
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,760
news for games that I know I'm not going to play, but I still find it interesting and

88
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
yeah.

89
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,480
So, but, but there are some games you still do play today, right?

90
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
Of course.

91
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
Of course.

92
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,080
You still have all the, you have all the systems, 360, PS3, right?

93
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Yep.

94
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
The only one I didn't get this generation was the Wii.

95
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,480
So top, not missing much, uh, top three games ever, not to put you on the spot or anything,

96
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,400
but three, if you can't think of your top three, just like three really freaking great

97
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
games.

98
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Super Metroid.

99
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Good pick.

100
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Valkyrie profile.

101
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,160
That's a good pick too.

102
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,760
And street fighter alpha two.

103
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,400
Ooh, why alpha two and not just straight up two, which is the most notable, I suppose.

104
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:58,960
I think the alpha or zero series is the best street fighter has ever been as far as art

105
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,360
design play style, combo system, music, everything.

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,000
Dan came in here and give the big thumbs up.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,080
I think all is forgiven now.

108
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,480
All right.

109
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,680
So a welcome once again, salacious pop, and I know you have some, uh, big shoes to fill

110
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
and a you're even putting on the heels tonight just to, uh, fill in for dark soccer.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No, I'm kidding.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm kidding.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
But you will pet Shermie and plays a dark soccer.

114
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm sure.

115
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Yes.

116
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Sure.

117
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Me is still here.

118
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Sassy in her kitty bed is always pet.

119
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Sure.

120
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Me instead of dark Sakura.

121
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
What?

122
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
That's what it sounds like.

123
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,280
Cause in place of dark Sakura, Oh, shut up.

124
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
All right.

125
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Anyhow.

126
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
You guys are crazy.

127
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
All right.

128
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,400
We're going to get into how was your gaming week, but first we weren't here last week.

129
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,240
Not only have we had a little bit of fail and, and, uh, starting a little late tonight,

130
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,600
but we were not here at all last week.

131
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,920
Um, salacious pop and I were at Disneyland, which was awesome.

132
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,440
I don't have to tell you twice.

133
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Yep.

134
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,880
There's a lot of lolsy, funny stuff about the electronica event that happens at Disneyland.

135
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,440
Because if you guys don't know what electronica is, it happens, um, at Disneyland, uh, California

136
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,760
venture, the second park down there, Westcott, if you will, uh, it is, uh, an event that

137
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
happens at night.

138
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,960
Which is becoming more like the first park, to be honest.

139
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,920
Well, they, they, they're getting more of the thrill rides and so forth, and they're

140
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,360
doing this huge make over there and cars land and the most expensive ride they've ever done

141
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,280
is supposed to be at that park, but that's to get people to go there because a lot of

142
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
people weren't going there.

143
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
One of the things they do is electronica.

144
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,880
And we've talked about this on the show before, uh, go back to the E3 shows this year, because

145
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,360
we took Bobby, uh, for the first time to electronica.

146
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,120
They have a replica Flynn's arcade, where, uh, all the arcade machines from the 80s,

147
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,920
and they work great, because if they don't work great, they take them out.

148
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,080
We saw him removing a machine, which I thought was kind of funny, like-

149
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,840
Taking it out back to shoot it.

150
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,360
Apparently, apparently, I don't know what they do, but yeah, they have to take the machine

151
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,680
out of there, because they won't have any-

152
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,840
So he's a bit loose, take her out back, put her out of her misery.

153
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Fail machines.

154
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,040
And, uh, you know, all these cool little Tron decorations, and people dressed up in Tron

155
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,800
gear, and they're basically having like a giant rave, and, uh, playing like Daft Punk

156
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
and that sort of music.

157
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,840
I don't know, am I, am I saying everything correctly here, Salacious Pop, about electronica?

158
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,440
Yeah, sounds about right.

159
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,920
So we love electronica, because we're nerds, and we love Tron.

160
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,280
Like Tron is like one of the greatest Disney products there is, right?

161
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,360
Electronica was not supposed to be at the park anymore, it was supposed to finish not

162
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,040
long after the movie came out, and it's been extended time and time and time again.

163
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,980
And the most recent news on the net was it's being extended through spring 2012, which

164
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:34,000
that's great news, because, uh, that means, uh, you can enjoy Flynn's arcade, and the,

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,560
you know, perfect 80s actual arcade machines for just that much longer, and those of us

166
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,520
that are nerds and huge fans of Tron's are happy.

167
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,080
But while we were at the park, I was talking to an employee kind of candidly about electronica,

168
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,440
and he said, well yeah, you know, it's closing after Labor Day, and we were like, what?

169
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,560
It's closing after Labor Day, but we heard it was spring 2012, and we have like all these

170
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,080
people that we know that are coming to the park in October, like just to go to electronica

171
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,160
and check it out before it closes.

172
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,880
And he was like, well yeah, it's closing after Labor Day, and it's, you know, it's probably

173
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,360
going to come back in a different configuration.

174
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,960
And we were like, oh my gosh, so making posts to Facebook, angry friends making comments

175
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,360
about how could electronica close before they see it.

176
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,360
It was like telling a bunch of preschoolers that Santa Claus had died.

177
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Yeah, basically.

178
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,160
They were like, what, no!

179
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,080
It was, yeah, or just like just slapping ice cream out of their hand.

180
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Same reaction.

181
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
What is that?

182
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
What is that thing?

183
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Coning or whatever.

184
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,040
It's like that where you grab the top of the cone, that dumbass thing.

185
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
So it was stupid.

186
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,720
Yes, it was.

187
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:40,640
So anyhow, to make a long story short, too late, I know, we found out that yes, a lot

188
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,000
of electronica is closing after Labor Day, but for three weeks, then it's coming back

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
weekends only.

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,120
You have to understand, they're putting electronica in the Disney vault, and then they're going

191
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,600
to re-release it later on as a special edition, because that's what Disney does with everything.

192
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,220
So finally, we figured that out.

193
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,480
So my friends that are going to the park in October are happy because they'll get to see

194
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,760
it because they're going on a weekend, so it doesn't matter that it's weekends only.

195
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
It's fine.

196
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,920
Nick Latov was going to be going the week before it reopens, and now he's pissed.

197
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,120
So I'm not supposed to probably be talking about that on the show, but oh well, what

198
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
are you going to do?

199
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,080
And look at that, he just joined chat to stomp and pout with our chatters at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

200
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,280
So, yeah, so we had fun at Disneyland and electronica and all that, and so that's where

201
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,680
we were last week, and we just ended up having the show off, because Jamie was helping a

202
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,680
friend move, and you know, Logie's got the kids, so he enjoys a week off.

203
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,840
When electronica reopens after this three week renovation or whatever, it's going to

204
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,560
be smaller, right?

205
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,600
Because of all the construction they're doing, or was that just a-

206
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Oh, probably.

207
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
California Adventure's a mess right now.

208
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,440
And Flynn's Arcade, is that still going to be there, or do you think they're taking that

209
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
out?

210
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
I hope they don't take it out.

211
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,160
I don't know how it ties back into gaming, because I'll tell you what, if you're in Southern

212
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,280
California, I do think you need to see electronica at least once, because that arcade is awesome.

213
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,160
It's like, it's just like the arcade in the movie, and all the machines actually work,

214
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,200
and how often do you get to go to an arcade where the machines freaking work?

215
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,920
That's when Starrcade is ruined, they should make it permanent.

216
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,440
Dan is saying since Starrcade is ruined, they should just make it permanent.

217
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
They should.

218
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,880
They should move Flynn's into Starrcade.

219
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
But here's the rumors about the replacement.

220
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,480
I don't mean to turn this into a Disney podcast, but deal.

221
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,480
They're going to replace electronica with the mad tea party.

222
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Based off of the Tim Burton.

223
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,340
Based off of the terrible Tim Burton version of Alice in Wonderland.

224
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,400
But if you think about it, it's going to be so easy to convert.

225
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,320
All they have to do, get Zeus a mad hatter outfit, get all the dancers little, you know,

226
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,160
wacky colors and stuff, and then close Flynn's Arcade or turn it into a tea room or something.

227
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,680
I hope that doesn't happen.

228
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,920
I think Flynn's Arcade should stay a fixture, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

229
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Well, they need to move Flynn's Arcade to the part that's next to Space Mountain.

230
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,360
Because they're used to have Tron stuff in Tomorrowland.

231
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, you see, here's the thing, though, is that since Star Tours is all new, they want

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,340
all that business in the area or what have you.

233
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
So I don't know.

234
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
It would be nice.

235
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:06,160
But sadly, there's just not a lot of arcade love in the world anymore.

236
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,840
And I think that even at Disneyland you're seeing it.

237
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,560
Get rid of that stupid, imaginary, spinning piece of crap that was there.

238
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,020
How fucking badass would it be?

239
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,640
If they would take that dome and turn it into some type of, like, light disc battle.

240
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Like a battle arena.

241
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,240
Like a Tron battle arena.

242
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,760
Where there could be a ride where you go around in a little light bike or something and it

243
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
could just be all neon inside.

244
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,140
I mean, it would cost hella money to renovate that place, but it would be awesome.

245
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,080
Like a battle grid or something in Tomorrowland.

246
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
It would be so badass.

247
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,000
Or it would have been even more badass as if, well, I know people keep killing themselves

248
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,760
on the goddamn rides, but like, remember when they had the rocket rods and stuff like that

249
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,040
and it would go around on that, make that as a Tron.

250
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,920
In the 80s, it was a Tron thing.

251
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
The people mover had a Tron tunnel.

252
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
The light speed Tron tunnel.

253
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Yeah, I remember that.

254
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Back when the first Tron movie was new.

255
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
So it was very old.

256
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,100
I remember that, but remember the rocket rods went really fast.

257
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,820
So have like some sort of motorcycle ride thing that'd be sweet.

258
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,800
And you can find Marvel merchandise at Disneyland now because of, you know, not really a merger.

259
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
They bought Marvel outright.

260
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Right, yeah.

261
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,720
In a lot of the Disney merch stores, you can find Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, action

262
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,120
figures, the three 16 week games, all that stuff.

263
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,040
So we're going to see some of those themed rides because you know how like all these

264
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,960
Six Flags stuff have the DC rides.

265
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Yeah, that's right.

266
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,320
They have the Superman and Superman, Batman and all.

267
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,580
I again, I don't mean to turn this into a Disney podcast, but whatever.

268
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,720
It's an off night tonight anyway.

269
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Here's the thing.

270
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,940
I think if Disney ever does do a third gate in Anaheim, which they have the space for,

271
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,320
but it would mean California Adventure has got to be successful.

272
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,200
I think if they do a third park, they might do like a third park about like Marvel stuff

273
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,640
and it could even be a thrill ride park to compete with Magic Mountain.

274
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
But I don't know.

275
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,460
I'm not going to hold my breath.

276
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,940
And the Disney doesn't really have thrill parks because they're not very family friendly,

277
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
but I don't know.

278
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
I think one could be successful there.

279
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,840
I think that's what kind of California Adventure is kind of, it started off as, okay, we're

280
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,640
going to try everything that didn't really kind of fit in Disneyland.

281
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,040
And now it's like, ah, we need more Disneyland in here.

282
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,560
Coming to our chat room for some comments, the chat.orangelandtrady.com, at least the

283
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,160
chatters are into this tonight.

284
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,640
Tiger Claw says they will bring Electronica back when Tron 3 comes out.

285
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,040
You know, that's a distinct possibility.

286
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,960
I hope to God it's true they're making a Tron 3.

287
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,160
I heard the Bruce Boxliner interview that 2013, and they certainly have loaded it and

288
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,220
set it up for one in the Blu-ray.

289
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,600
So I really hope that does happen.

290
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,560
Dark Tetsuya says Rob should work for Disney Imagineering.

291
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,520
Act Def says if any Disney employee is listening, they should hire Rob as an Imagineer.

292
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
Oh, I would love that.

293
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,320
In fact, I would just turn everything into Tron in Tomorrowland.

294
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,800
Hey, I'm down.

295
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Autotopia, Nickatron.

296
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,640
I can Imagineer like Space Mountain Tron.

297
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,360
I can Imagineer like anything.

298
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,600
I mean, just whatever you need, I'll Imagineer.

299
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Build it?

300
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,040
No, I'm not really good at doing that part, but hell, I can imagine all sorts of crazy

301
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
things.

302
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,080
Okay, the last thing I'll say on Disney, Frisbee in our chat room at chat.orangelandtrady.com

303
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,080
says and have Rob host the new Disney podcast, Orange Lounge Disneyel.

304
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,440
Well, you know, we've been teasing the idea of a third podcast for a while and I will

305
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
say this isn't it.

306
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,200
But one of the ideas that was tossed around was doing like a Disney type podcast.

307
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,180
But the problem with that is that Disney is supposed to be a very family friendly thing.

308
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,840
And we have a lot of very foul mouths around.

309
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,400
So I don't know if the two worlds would combine very well.

310
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,880
I think there would be a niche audience for a Disney mature podcast like, you know, fuck

311
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,440
the kids Disneyland's for me like that would probably be the name of it.

312
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,000
But I don't know how well that would do and how much Disney would approve of something

313
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
like that.

314
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,720
So didn't happen.

315
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,200
Disneyland's just something we really like.

316
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
So anyhow, let's go back to games.

317
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,620
So we were off for a week.

318
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,120
So we don't have a lot of news in the show world tonight about what happened last week.

319
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,840
But I've got to talk about must say PAX happened.

320
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,760
But I don't think that was really PAX happened and surprisingly not a ton of news out of

321
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
PAX.

322
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,520
I mean, a lot of it was seen and so forth.

323
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Yes.

324
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,080
And expansions, a few things like that.

325
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,260
But nothing major.

326
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,160
And I was proven wrong.

327
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,000
You know, games analysts aren't always right.

328
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,600
I thought for sure Nintendo would announce those games, Xenoblade and so forth coming

329
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
out here.

330
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,040
They did not take the opportunity to at PAX.

331
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
I don't think it's happened.

332
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,600
They didn't do much of anything at PAX, did they?

333
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
No.

334
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,360
In fact, I didn't really hear even what they were showing at their booth.

335
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,320
I imagine it was all the 3DS stuff.

336
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,480
That's got to be what they were.

337
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,600
Well, they announced what some new 3DS stuff.

338
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,000
But we'll get into that later.

339
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,060
And then yeah, it's it's pretty and it's funny is they haven't really even announced the

340
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,960
dates yet for the two Mario games on the 3DS.

341
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,440
It's just we know it's November, December.

342
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,480
But you know, they've already announced everything up through the end of November.

343
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Where are those titles?

344
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,680
Oh, well, we'll we'll come back to that, you know, figure it out, you know, see how well

345
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,520
these other games do.

346
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,800
So the big news that happened last week was about a company I've been critical of on this

347
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
show in the past.

348
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
It was GameStop.

349
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,640
As I like I like Bobby's name for him.

350
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,000
I think I might Jack the name Evil G is what he always calls him on the show.

351
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I might call him that.

352
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,120
But I don't mean to disrespect the people working the front lines at the stores and

353
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
so forth.

354
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,360
Because, you know, I understand those of you that make very little money serving the customer

355
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,120
directly are in a very thankless job and my beef with Evil G is not with those people.

356
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,720
Although I some do get a bad rap and I have been to some stores where those guys are a

357
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
holes.

358
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,920
But that's not my beef.

359
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,800
My beef with GameStop has to do with a much higher management and some of the ways some

360
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,240
of the decisions they make and some of the ways that they run their company.

361
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,900
And funny enough a lot of that came to light this last week.

362
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,760
I'm sure I don't need to report this I'm sure all of you have heard this or read it on a

363
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
gaming blog somewhere.

364
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,460
But if you've been living in a cave I'll kind of sum it up for you.

365
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,640
New game was released last week.

366
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,520
I always say Deus Ex but it's Deus Ex Deus Ex.

367
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,960
And the PC version came out and it was announced on the Internet about two days before it came

368
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,240
out that it was going to come with a coupon so you get the game for free on on live which

369
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,160
of course is the streaming service that everybody laughed at three years ago until they showed

370
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,840
up at E3 and was like no really people you're going to stream these games over the Internet

371
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
and it fucking works.

372
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,840
And everybody's like holy fuck it does work.

373
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,800
Now on live's biggest challenge is they have no games like they have very few games on

374
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
their service.

375
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,360
But to get a new game like Deus Ex is a big coup for them.

376
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,660
So they want to show off their service try to get more people on on live and get people

377
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,080
buying games over there.

378
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,600
So they put in a coupon some type of partnership with Square Enix where you would be able to

379
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,320
get a free version of Deus Ex on on live with the PC version.

380
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,000
Well Evil G didn't like that because Evil G just recently bought one of these online

381
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,880
streaming companies a competitor of on live if you will and clearly plans to launch their

382
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,440
own service.

383
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,440
So an internal memo was leaked to the Internet where Evil G told their employees essentially

384
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,800
to go open all of the boxes of Deus Ex on the PC take out the code and throw them away.

385
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,880
And that's that.

386
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,200
And so obviously a lot of people not happy to know that the employees opened the product

387
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,040
and took something out of it and then sold it as new and then sold it as new.

388
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,280
Which is funny to me because this isn't a new policy at the G. This is not something

389
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
new for them.

390
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,860
We've heard for years on the Internet and so forth about how they open games let employees

391
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,200
rent them and take them home and then bring them back to the store and sell them as a

392
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
new game.

393
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,380
Sometimes they reshrink them.

394
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,440
This is nothing new but I guess for whatever reason this is what has pushed people over

395
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,520
the edge and I think what it is is that now it's really something of value came out of

396
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
the box.

397
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,960
You know that coupon for all practical purposes was a fifty dollar value although let's be

398
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,720
real I'm sure you can't cross save the on live servers don't talk to the PC yet.

399
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,340
So this on live thing and you're playing your normal version on the PC anyway.

400
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,420
This on live thing is really just a oh neat I have it I play it for five minutes and then

401
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,920
need I saw it I'm done.

402
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,880
Like I bet very very very very few people are truly using that coupon.

403
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,100
But because that coupon you feel like it's a fifty dollar value now evil G has ripped

404
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,200
that out of your hands and you're pissed.

405
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,240
And now there's an issue with the policy that they've been doing for years.

406
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,680
And so this all came to light and it's been really really bad for them.

407
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,260
Here's the surprising thing.

408
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,420
I'm slightly sympathetic towards GameStop.

409
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,560
I actually think it was kind of screwed up of Squeenix to include a competitor's coupon

410
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,120
and not tell evil G what they were doing.

411
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,640
The appropriate response is what GameStop did at the end of the day.

412
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,520
Finally the next day or maybe very late that day they said you know what we're taking this

413
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,680
game off our shelves altogether and we're sending the boxes back to Square Enix.

414
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,720
That's what should have been done in the first place.

415
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,440
If it had been done in the first place none of this would have ever happened.

416
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,760
They wouldn't have had the bad rap.

417
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,320
I mean sure there'd be people to go oh GameStop won't sell Deus Ex on the PC too good huh

418
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:57,300
but it's not like it's unheard of that a store doesn't sell a certain product right.

419
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,800
Like most RadioShacks don't sell video games.

420
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,920
If you go in there and ask for a copy of a new game on the PC and they say we don't have

421
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
it.

422
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,360
Well what the fuck you don't have it right.

423
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,840
You just oh OK I guess I'll go next door to Target or whatever right.

424
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,320
But what it did is it just brought this whole thing to light up.

425
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,840
You mean they're opening new things and then reselling them as new like who the fuck does

426
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
that.

427
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
Best Buy doesn't do that.

428
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Target doesn't do that.

429
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Walmart doesn't.

430
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,280
Because if you think about it like let's just take it to the extreme here what if they were

431
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:28,960
say there is some bonus download content that came with a game like say Gears of War something

432
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,640
like that comes with like a map pack or something like that and they say hey you know what we're

433
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,480
going to break open all the copies of Gears of War we're going to take it out and we're

434
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,480
going to sell that map pack separately and then we're also going to sell the game as

435
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,000
new.

436
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,680
So it's brought this policy of theirs to light and part of me of course is doing the Nelson

437
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,640
laugh pointing and going you know I've been telling you guys for a while this is part

438
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,760
of their crap policies and so forth but you know whatever I'm sure people will forget

439
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,960
about this in a couple weeks and continue to buy their games from there.

440
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,340
But it was interesting to kind of see that all come to light and I think the appropriate

441
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,660
response was what happened at the end of the day.

442
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,240
But unfortunately GameStop is too comfortable with let's open new things and then resell

443
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,480
them as new and finally the public was like wait a minute you can't do that.

444
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:17,460
When I go to Fry's and that's been done there's an open box that's cheaper that I buy because

445
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,460
the box has been opened.

446
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,460
That's the way it works right.

447
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,120
They thought that no one would know.

448
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,040
They thought that no one's going to know that they did this and then on top of that they

449
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,840
also thought hey you know what well and this is actually what they did because they they

450
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,680
made Square Enix apologize to them and they're like oh yeah we're OK with them taking that

451
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
stuff back.

452
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Yeah you know why?

453
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Because they're GameStop.

454
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,280
GameStop says oh no fucking you didn't we're not going to sell your fucking games anymore

455
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,200
and they're like oh wait a second we'll go ahead and take those games back we're sorry

456
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,140
we shouldn't have ever done that.

457
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,980
And we as the consumer have given GameStop that monopoly.

458
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,980
Oh yeah.

459
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,160
And if you want that shit to stop you need to take it away.

460
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,600
You need to take that monopoly away.

461
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
There is nothing.

462
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
I'm not going to hold my breath.

463
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
There is nothing.

464
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,800
Why do people go to GameStop in the first place.

465
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,940
Oh because you get a little bit extra download content and stuff like that.

466
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,940
Think about it.

467
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,500
Do you really care if you get an extra skin.

468
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,280
Oh if your hat is orange now instead of green or something like that.

469
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,400
I mean just they're not the only company out there that sells games.

470
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,940
They're not even the best company out there that sells games.

471
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:29,360
I mean they're just it's just something you know a product you can go to a bunch of other

472
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,600
stores and buy that product and guess what those stores didn't take out the coupons for

473
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
on live.

474
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,320
It's because they feel that they have this new service.

475
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,240
Well can you wait and see what's going to happen when that new streaming service comes

476
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,160
around.

477
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,640
That's going to be fun.

478
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,320
I think that it might have been on a Bobby Black Wolf show last week or the week before

479
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:58,720
someone had called in and said that they had worked at a indie game retail shop and that

480
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,200
they offered much better trade in credit for used games and GameStop did but they could

481
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,320
not get people to shop there because oh if I get the game at GameStop and my green dude

482
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,800
will get a costume code for a slightly lighter shade of green.

483
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,200
And people eat that shit up.

484
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,120
They do eat that shit up and it's sad.

485
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,000
It's sad because that's what they're such a big company now that they can make those

486
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,120
deals and those deals ensure more people come to those stores and it screws everybody else

487
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,680
out and even sometimes they'll be like yeah we want to have the exclusive on that special

488
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,560
edition or whatever or they'll put out some other thing and it's all funded by the publishers

489
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,800
because the publishers will do whatever the fuck they want because they're the majority.

490
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,200
If they don't have the GameStop business they go under.

491
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,800
Yeah if your game's not a GameStop that's a huge coverage of distribution that you've

492
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
lost.

493
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,080
I have a comment in our chat room at chat.ornislandry.com Cajudo in chat says in GameStop's defense

494
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,420
Square Enix and OnLive were in the wrong on the coupon side.

495
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,760
Both parties were not in the right.

496
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,480
I actually agree with that and I do think Square Enix needed to apologize to GameStop

497
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,480
because that wasn't cool to include a competitor's coupon.

498
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,160
This is truly a case of though two wrongs don't make a right because who got hurt in

499
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
the end?

500
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Did Square Enix get hurt?

501
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,280
Did GameStop get hurt?

502
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
No.

503
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
The buyers got hurt.

504
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,400
I don't really feel so bad for GameStop because their service is not live.

505
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,520
It's not done yet.

506
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
It's not even launched.

507
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,640
It's not even in a beta yet.

508
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,040
I don't feel bad for GameStop because they've been opening shit for years and reselling

509
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
it as new.

510
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,920
I understand that but I'm saying there's no reason they should have had to apologize to

511
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,080
them in the first place because it's like saying oh I'm gonna sell this at Walmart.

512
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,340
Walmart's like oh well we're gonna take the code out because we're gonna come out with

513
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,200
our own streaming service five years from now.

514
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,920
Oh well I'm sorry I didn't confirm with you to see if you have a streaming service coming.

515
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,680
I mean big fucking deal yeah you bought a company and you say it's coming out in the

516
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,120
spring of 2012 but is it really gonna come out then?

517
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,840
I mean this thing could be delayed till 2013 and really what?

518
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,880
First off, not that many people buy PC games in the first place and second off, not everybody's

519
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:06,860
gonna be using that coupon for the free game on OnLive so I just don't know.

520
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,000
If you're worried that your service is gonna be that much threatened by OnLive then you

521
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,880
better figure out some way to save yourselves because OnLive sure got a jump on you.

522
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,200
Alright I don't, go ahead.

523
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,120
They never, they didn't do this with Portal 2 which came with the Steam integration code.

524
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,440
But they don't have, well and actually that does make sense because it's, they're streaming,

525
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
they're talking about streaming.

526
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,720
See if there was some sort of streaming copy but that's, but they also have their digital

527
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,200
store that they do sell stuff in.

528
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,400
Anyhow all I gotta say is that as long as the consumer continues to give GameStop the

529
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,720
monopoly this shit's gonna happen but GameStop's scared because they're looking five years

530
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,760
ahead and I think they are a little worried and I think they should be to some extent.

531
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,160
You know stories like this aren't helping it's just pushing digital distribution up

532
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,440
faster and the life cycle of the GameStop store.

533
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,480
Think of it guys, GameStop is going to go the way of Blockbuster in five to ten years.

534
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Think about it.

535
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,280
Digital distribution is never gonna, it doesn't matter.

536
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,720
Just because it's just another segment of the business that's not gonna take over the

537
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
business.

538
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,640
And the reason why is because people like physical copies of things.

539
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,040
Some things though people can get away with getting digitally like certain games they,

540
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,520
I don't care about that.

541
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,240
And actually it's kind of the publishers fault a little bit because nowadays hell they're

542
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,960
not even throwing manuals in there it's just a case with a disk in it and that's it.

543
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,400
Alright I wanna get to this week's news but let me do a couple more comments from our

544
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
chat room.

545
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,200
After all it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

546
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,920
SonicM88 in our chat at chat.orangelandtrader.com says I also have a good friend who works at

547
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,200
GameStop so I'm a little partial.

548
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,800
And that's in response to something you said earlier.

549
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,840
I go to GameStop for the knowledge.

550
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,200
Their employees always know the most about gaming.

551
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,760
And so yeah you know I think every store is different in that capacity it just kind of

552
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,900
depends and there are I mean like I said at the top my always my beef is GameStop has

553
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,920
never been the front line employees.

554
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,400
It's like any other business.

555
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,440
Some of them are jerks and I don't want to shop at those stores but there are some really

556
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,040
decent people who work at GameStop and that are very knowledgeable about games.

557
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,840
However the bonehead mistakes of management such as what occurred here is just gonna hurt

558
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,040
all those people and it's unfortunate.

559
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,340
And I understand that it's good to have knowledgeable staff at your stores but at the same time

560
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,880
the consumer needs to educate themselves on games.

561
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,520
I mean you don't go blindly into obviously if you're going into a game store you kind

562
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,040
of have an idea of what you want.

563
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,840
I mean and we're talking in a day and age where there's the Internet.

564
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,440
I mean if you want to educate yourself on any about people who come into game stores.

565
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,360
Does Dan want a mic?

566
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,440
People who come into game stores ninety percent of time don't know a dick about what they

567
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
want.

568
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
OK.

569
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
Nothing.

570
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,120
You know what you want when you go into a game store.

571
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,200
But that's because you're an ultra gamer.

572
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,780
Most people come in they're just like oh and they come to you and they're like tell me

573
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,400
what's good.

574
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,560
That's why there's a GameStop.

575
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,400
That's why GameStop even exists because you can't get that at Best Buy because ninety

576
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,880
six percent of people who work at Best Buy don't work in the game section and the two

577
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,560
that do are never fucking there.

578
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,840
The reason GameStop exists it's not that they sell the most games and again it's not like

579
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,000
they sell them the best.

580
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,640
It's just that they're the one store left in the fucking world that you walk into and

581
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:38,480
it's just all games all the time and if it's any store with a staff that's worth a fuck

582
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,680
everyone there knows about all the games.

583
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Bring it back.

584
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Bring it back motherfucker.

585
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Do it!

586
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,920
Well then those type of people anyway should be shopping at Walmart anyways because they're

587
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:55,200
you know brainless drones that will just stumble right in to buy any game that you say is good.

588
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Well right but exactly.

589
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Yes!

590
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
They're not going to do the difference and all you have to do is educate yourself.

591
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,880
Hey well these people are stupid they're just going to buy whatever you tell them to and

592
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,160
they're like okay.

593
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,880
That's why GameStop exists.

594
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,120
That's why GameStop makes money and that's why GameStop is important because they've

595
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,500
got tremendous pull in the industry.

596
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,140
The people who go to Walmart are either just pointing and shooting and hoping for a good

597
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:22,360
game or it's someone like you who goes I ain't going to GameStop I'll just stop by Walmart

598
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,280
or Target and hope they have it on the shelf and just bag it.

599
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,480
But for the unwashed masses that's why you hope that you go to a specialty retailer with

600
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,200
a crew that knows about games.

601
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,920
And there's plenty of other specialty retailers out there.

602
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
Plan trade.

603
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,560
No no no no no.

604
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
Lots of indies.

605
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,640
Right right sure there's a couple.

606
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
Look at Sacramento.

607
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,500
How many plan trades do we have?

608
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,760
Do we even still have one?

609
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
Folsom's gone right?

610
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Yeah Folsom's gone.

611
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,040
Okay and how many indies do we have?

612
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Three?

613
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,560
A few.

614
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,940
You know there aren't many left and I think that's terrible because I loved independent

615
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,940
game stores.

616
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,940
Oh yeah.

617
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,320
That's the reason I ended up working at GameStop because I was going to use Funco Land at the

618
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,280
moment to teach myself to run an independent game store.

619
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,520
But the problem is is that you know the Akira wave hit and they just engulfed all the other

620
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,640
retailers and what killed GameStop was when they was when they got EB.

621
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,040
Because when they got EB there was no incentive to be a better company because they were the

622
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,280
fucking company.

623
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,560
And now they're only competing on an area where they're so concerned about oh the intangible

624
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,940
competition of this coupon.

625
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:40,440
Right OnLive was really really competing with GameStop's non-existent streaming service.

626
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
Good job guys.

627
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,920
Way to embrace the added value.

628
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,320
I'm sure all two dozen people who keep OnLive because of that coupon are going to never

629
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,440
go to GameStop again right?

630
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Dipshits.

631
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,640
Of course let's also remember that like seven GameStops still sell any amount of PC games

632
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
anyway.

633
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Fuck.

634
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
I'm done.

635
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,640
All right Dan's rant from the front lines.

636
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,000
He's been there in the front.

637
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,560
And I do think we need to also fairly you know in the chats there's some chatter in

638
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,140
our chat room fairly slap Square Enix on the wrist here too.

639
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,440
They are not without fault in this whole story.

640
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,360
Seriously Final Fantasy 14 what's going on?

641
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,760
It's really Final Fantasy 14's fault when all said and done but no seriously I mean

642
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
they do have a responsibility.

643
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:28,280
It was not cool of them to two days before springing on everybody including the retailers.

644
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,400
Oh by the way we're pushing OnLive in this.

645
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,600
You know that wasn't cool.

646
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,120
Uh you know I think it's cooler than you know say THQ going oh by the way we have this thing

647
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,480
where you have to buy the game new otherwise you got to pay ten dollars to play online

648
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,720
ha ha ha ha suckas.

649
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,680
By the way you need to be connected online all the time to play our game Ubisoft.

650
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,560
I agree and I agree all around.

651
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,680
I think we've given those companies fair razzings where they need to go.

652
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,240
I just want to say this on GameStop and then I swear we'll move into our gaming weeks and

653
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,240
so forth.

654
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,120
It's just like you know I still think the problem at the end of the day although I think

655
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,920
Dan does make a very good point that they're one of the few places left that's all about

656
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,080
the games and the completely clueless can at least kind of have an idea of a place where

657
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
to go.

658
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,540
I think even people like that when they hear about this in the mainstream media and it

659
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:23,180
was on CNN it was on CBS news dot com this was picked up by the mainstream media and

660
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,040
it's funny we have a story later tonight that's going to get into the lols about the local

661
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,840
news and how they can skew stories and so forth.

662
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,160
I think when they do this stuff and communicated to the masses the masses like oh GameStop's

663
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,800
ripping people off well I'm not going to go there anymore.

664
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:43,440
You know these people that are completely clueless about their games are also pretty

665
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,960
fickle and I think when they find out that there are other options available to them

666
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,840
you know this is this is a great opportunity for companies like Best Buy.

667
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,320
I think Target I'm trying to think of who's been trying to strengthen their gaming lately

668
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,720
I know we've heard the reports about the Best Buy's doing something and I think I want to

669
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,880
say there was a Target initiative too because they were doing buybacks to games and so forth.

670
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,800
In the end of the day this is going to work out really well for them.

671
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,440
It's about seizing this opportunity I think.

672
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,400
So anyhow I think Amazon don't they have new gaming stuff but Amazon's weird because they're

673
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,840
such a huge company but we never see them like they're just out and on the internet.

674
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,780
Well and I think if you listen to what Dana just said about people needing advice on like

675
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,960
what freaking games to buy I think that kind of answers the question as to why Amazon will

676
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,880
never be the only store.

677
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,520
It will always be an option for the people that know what they want for the people that

678
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,480
don't know what they want Amazon doesn't work.

679
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,720
And granted for the people that I would say listen to our show I mean I would hope that

680
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,600
a lot of them that are pretty knowledgeable of games that are coming out but if you're

681
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,320
not I mean there's message boards out there you know hey you know I'm interested in blah

682
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:01,640
blah blah blah blah you know what games would you recommend that I play.

683
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,400
Dan's yelling from the living room but we can't hear him so all right let's move on.

684
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,440
We talked like for a half hour about GameStop and that whole story last week I want to move

685
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
on.

686
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,480
Let's move on into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you have been playing.

687
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
Loki we'll start with you tonight.

688
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
So Star Stalker is not here.

689
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,060
How was your gaming week?

690
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,060
It was all right.

691
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,720
I still haven't been playing a whole lot of stuff.

692
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:29,800
I played a little bit more of VVVV and I have all the shiny objects except for one and it's

693
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,140
the probably one of the hardest ones to get.

694
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:43,320
It's four screens of dodging spikes and then you hit the top reverse and dodge four more

695
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,520
screens of spikes it makes you want to pull your hair out and I just said you know what

696
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,480
fuck it I know what I get for getting this I get the whole game upside down and I don't

697
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,320
give a fuck about playing this game again so that's it I'm done with that game and then

698
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,160
it's still a great game though it was a great game yes but and I understand it's supposed

699
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,240
to be really hard but it's just like I don't care I don't care it's like they're like ha

700
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:14,000
you have to go through four screens jump over this one little like ledge that yes I get

701
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,840
it my character can't jump but he can reverse gravity you think if you have the technology

702
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,560
to reverse gravity you can I don't know step over something but of course you know whatever

703
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,200
rules of the game so okay um but yeah I'm just not playing anymore because I don't care

704
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:35,680
to get to some secret laboratory or whatever that's got you know some bonus stuff I don't

705
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,440
care about whatever um played more Earth Defense Force inside Garmageddon I have my first character

706
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:49,440
leveled up to tier eight my tactical guy and I guess gotta start working on some of my

707
00:35:49,440 --> 00:36:01,120
other characters like my trooper jet and was it battle so very fun game still and hopefully

708
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,920
gonna be playing a little bit more co-op on that because I haven't gotten a chance to

709
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,880
lately been playing lots of Grand Theft Auto still still fun still trying to win as many

710
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,680
games as possible so I can get my ranks up because I not playing for about six months

711
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,280
drop me about 30 30 ranks in the rank death match so that kind of pissed me off a little

712
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:30,720
bit but nothing really I could do there just a lot of people not necessarily beating me

713
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,620
but played less game so if they you know have a streak of 10 or whatever counts a lot more

714
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:42,840
than what I get I have to I'd have like a streak of 30 and if I lose one it's just going

715
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:49,360
back just as far so it sucks cuz I played so many games and then what else did I play

716
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:59,960
not much download my 3ds NES games so have those on my 3ds now so played them though

717
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:14,440
trying to play something else on the iPod now that's pretty much it all right so pop

718
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:22,320
how was your gaming week mostly World of Warcraft a lot of World of Warcraft at the Flint's

719
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:29,320
arcade at Disneyland I got to play our type in an actual stand-up machine just as hard

720
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,640
as it is on the Super NES and every other incarnation of our type that's ever existed

721
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:41,800
also the classic I think this even this may even predate Street Fighter 1 by Capcom which

722
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:47,000
was an awful game but Konami's I think it's kung-fu master if anyone remembers that game

723
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,520
you're the little guy in the little white g with the black belt does you mean you are

724
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,040
kung-fu or something like that isn't yeah it's a tsunami fighter and these you are kung-fu

725
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,960
and like the big like yeah and I think the very first villain or combatant is like this

726
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,480
big chunky dude bald-headed that that game I'm I used to play the hell out of that game

727
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,700
at the pizza parlor when I was in junior high because you know we all played video games

728
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,480
at pizza parlors back then so yeah those two games were what I focused on it at Flint's

729
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,040
arcade there wasn't a lot there that really you know struck stuck out to me if they had

730
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:28,080
they had gauntlet and a bunch of other stuff but I've been checking out the games on Google

731
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,520
Plus because they just got their gaming API added and I've been playing believe it or

732
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,520
not a game I've had a lot of disdain for the Apple Store playing it on the iPad going I

733
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,160
don't get this why is everyone losing their mind over this game angry birds I'm playing

734
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,760
it right now actually on Dark Sakura's machine why oh that's very appropriate for not being

735
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,760
here why why angry birds I don't understand the allure of this game why why is does America

736
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,880
have and I'm assuming the rest the world to this sick fascination with angry birds it's

737
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,780
boring I don't know I I I am with you I played it it was alright it's kind of neat you know

738
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:09,440
yeah it's a physic puzzler and you launch birds in the things you need I but I don't

739
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,280
I'm not obsessed about it I like it was like it was alright you know it's cheap iPod game

740
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,320
as far as these iPod games go I like cut the rope but I wouldn't buy the guy on a t-shirt

741
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,140
and I've literally like while I was at Disneyland I saw like a ton of angry birds t-shirts they're

742
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:30,160
making a fucking movie based on this why why oh I know why because Hollywood's really run

743
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,080
out of ideas I mean it's like let's make a game I don't know if it's in our show role

744
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:43,000
but we've able is making a movie based on some like a doom clone no I didn't make our

745
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,760
show role because I saw it label and I was like it's like some doom clone it's like you

746
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,480
would never know it you know I didn't realize this obscure game is it's basically excuse

747
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,280
for him to make a zombie movie he's like okay what games a zombie thing okay I'm gonna base

748
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:04,420
my movie on this all right but we're we're we're digressing so slices pop you're playing

749
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:12,600
angry birds right now justify yourself look at your life look at your choice I know it's

750
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,360
it really takes just no brainpower to play this game you have unlimited retries you just

751
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,640
fling birds at shit until you kill all the pigs that's the whole game I know I have no

752
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,160
room to talk and there's a game I've been playing this didn't hit the pig when I aimed

753
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,600
it high so let's name it no and try it again no I did it and then like you're you know

754
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,880
it's now 3 in the morning and your iPhone is out of battery life I don't know I don't

755
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,560
get it but yeah I'm that and also I need to look up the name of it there for those

756
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:50,120
listening who enjoy bust a move or puzzle bobble it is as it is more appropriately called

757
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:59,400
there is a clone of that game on Google Plus called a ripoff of worms right there I'm not

758
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,960
sure but at the monkeys in it it was that monster world that character looked hideous

759
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,760
that was like a that was like a divine but not like a like Charlie the tuna dressed in

760
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,760
drag what was that like a monster world or something like that forget it it's called

761
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,360
for it's called bubble island and there's this little raccoon and he's like it plays

762
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,920
exactly like puzzle bobble bust a move so if you like like those games and have Google

763
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,420
Plus and you want to you can't really spam the shit out of people on Google Plus and

764
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,580
also Facebook has copied that format it all goes to a totally separate tab if you want

765
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,560
to support indie art or indie developers all they can do is make fucking clones of really

766
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,500
awesome games just you know the cash in then go right ahead is that iPhone developer game

767
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,400
loft or whatever they they thrive on ripping games off and they do it really well yeah

768
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,500
but that's that's the thing they do it really well I mean and to the point they fucking

769
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:56,880
got wow on an iPhone it's pretty pretty amazing I gotta say it's sad it's like you know it

770
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,160
would be like having Spielberg doing remakes of something we have we have some Angry Birds

771
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,000
defenders in our chat room at chat.com and every gamer does get a voice here act-def

772
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,640
says Angry Birds is fun not the best game ever Izzam says Angry Birds is just something

773
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,640
you can let your mind go numb on and waste time with Kaijuto says Angry Birds is the

774
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,840
best we all love to knock down stuff act-def says Angry Birds is fun because of the cute

775
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,840
destruction it happens in the game it's also like a puzzler so people like to knock things

776
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:31,080
over yeah I guess that's the allure of Jenga I don't know all right so Angry Birds fine

777
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:37,520
anything else Angry Birds wow the two games at Flynn's arcade and that oh um I play your

778
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:45,000
3ds when you're at work and I'm bored so what games on 3ds uh Metroid Ice Climbers uh Zelda

779
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,260
2 oh the ambassador games yeah the master were you kind of doing that thing where you'd

780
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,560
play them for five minutes and you go yep it's Zelda and then switch to another game

781
00:42:51,560 --> 00:43:00,760
yeah do you feel yourself needing to yell at Zelda 2 so why is this game so damn annoying

782
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,360
and games like that were easier when I was nine I don't know look look look there it

783
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,120
is like that it's not did you see that character like what the hell was that was that called

784
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:16,320
Monster Island it was like Charlie the Tuna in drag all right um all right so I guess

785
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,280
that's it for your yeah see wild ones that is a fucking ripoff right yeah that looks

786
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:26,000
like a worm it's a panda bear with a gun how could that game not be good all right moving

787
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,040
on I want to talk about my gaming week of which actually since you know I was out of

788
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,120
town I don't have a whole lot to talk about Flynn's arcade I played Frogger I don't know

789
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,880
why much much to Loki's dismay I love to play old school Frogger in an actual don't get

790
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,880
me wrong old school Frogger is cool I just don't see the need of the constant remakes

791
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,440
of Frogger I'm with you there because they weren't good and I played Donkey Kong Junior

792
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,800
like I've just been I don't know like I wanted to play that in the arcade hella bad and then

793
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,160
finally you could download that on your I know ironically enough that ended up being

794
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,480
one of the 3ds ambassador games and I played it there too and one of my whole like fun

795
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,280
it but it's funny I played it not even a day after I played the arcade version and I could

796
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,600
really see the difference like right away not like graphically but just in how the game

797
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,800
was a little easier on the NES than it was in the arcade that's for sure but that's you

798
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,480
can't like if you fall even a little bit from one platform to a platform that's underneath

799
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,680
you you die yeah you can't there's no yeah has to be you can do like a slight fall but

800
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,200
not not because I'm thinking it's like Mario where if it's not a pit where it just goes

801
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,240
off the bottom of the screen you can just jump down there no you're you die no yeah

802
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:34,000
so been playing some 3ds ambassador games as well played Metroid probably the longest

803
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,520
out of them all actually played Metroid for a little bit so that was kind of fun I do

804
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,240
loves me some Metroid and as far as other real games go I'll tell you what the game

805
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,680
that ate up the most of my time that wasn't wow was Civilization 5 I played an epic multiplayer

806
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,560
Civ 5 match over the weekend it went on for six hours me and two of my friends from the

807
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:58,600
Bay Area started up a game at 8 o'clock on Friday night and it was like 2 15 in the morning

808
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,960
and we were like oh my god it's like after one we should probably like go to bed so we

809
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,280
need to save the game and I don't even know if we're gonna be able to recover from the

810
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,140
save because like I couldn't save the game only the host could save the game so I really

811
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,640
hope we are able to restore from that save gamer it's gonna be very sad but at the same

812
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,340
time it was a lot of fun and just goes to show how freaking addicting that game was

813
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:26,160
but it was it was neat like I found that my two friends are very expansionistic whereas

814
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,120
I'm more about get five cities and make them just fucking fortresses and build them up

815
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,120
as best you can it's the year you know 1700 and they have laser beam technology or whatever

816
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,320
yeah actually yeah we had riflemen in the year 1500 we had to end the game around like

817
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,180
1600 of course we were on kind of dumb dumb difficulty because we didn't want the computer

818
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:49,560
to kick our ass too much so I don't know I just I love Civilization and the Civilization

819
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,840
series and Civ 5 is my favorite since the original so nothing will ever top the original

820
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:01,000
to me because I'm just stuck up that way but Civ 5 is pretty freaking great and I'm having

821
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,080
a lot of fun playing that online and I want to like do that again any iPhone games you've

822
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:11,800
been playing um tiny tower which whatever shut up don't don't taunt me I will say this

823
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,640
I've also been I besides Civ 5 and stuff and light light console stuff here and there keep

824
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,140
in mind guys my Xbox is still out of commission remember the hack it's been three weeks I

825
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:27,320
need to call Xbox tomorrow where's my money if they're even open it's Labor Day I don't

826
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:32,000
know so I only really have a ps3 and I was gone for most of the weeks that's why my gaming

827
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,240
week was a little bit sad but I will say this on Facebook speaking of sad I've got sucked

828
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:43,800
into sim social hanging my head in shame allowing I'm shaking my head in shame I know smh smh

829
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:50,640
it's just it's I will say this it's a pretty darn good ripoff of the sims and you know

830
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,120
I think everybody got addicted to the sims at some point not like there's definitely

831
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,480
varying levels of difficulty but okay why are you giving a big thumbs down slash spot

832
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:05,240
it was like a year maybe even two years after the sims one which came out what 2000 2001

833
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,880
came out it it had beaten mist as like the top selling pc game ever I played it for a

834
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,920
weekend I did not get it I thought it was so boring and I have not looked at the sims

835
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,320
franchise since and that was 10 years ago wow no I just I don't think people get sucked

836
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:27,520
into it like Jamie level Jamie plays a lot of sims but you know I played the first one

837
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,580
for a couple weeks and thought it was a lot of fun and you know kind of got sucked into

838
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,160
it and the lives of my little sims and now they have it on Facebook and of course here's

839
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:41,360
the thing I think they've done a good job of translating the sims into a Facebook game

840
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,880
even though the whole energy thing is very limiting but what can you do the game's free

841
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,980
you know there's got to be some limits but here's the thing I think sim social is also

842
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:54,560
like everything you fucking hate about a Facebook game is in this game like the spam on people's

843
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:00,540
walls and ask all your friends for a cookie or whatever and all this stuff like it's just

844
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:06,320
bullshit like how much this game fucks up your Facebook wall and this is why people

845
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:12,360
hate Facebook games like I really want sim social to be on Google Plus because I don't

846
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,480
think it will be because it can't be as invasive on Google Plus you're grinning over there

847
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,760
salacious pop yeah I have I have not added sim social to my Facebook in any way so it's

848
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,180
I don't technically have it installed or whatever it's called but if I go to my games tab on

849
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:30,680
Facebook there's at least 10 people that I know very well in real life that are like

850
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,000
join sim social and send me a little fluffy pillow because I'm trying to renovate my living

851
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,200
room and I need it for my couch send me a pillow and I just want to say like no I'll

852
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,680
send you fire to burn down your goddamn house stop bothering me they actually do have fury

853
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:51,640
anyway but yeah this is why people hate Facebook games it is the fastest growing game since

854
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,560
Farmville though it's the biggest it's going to be the biggest Facebook game since Farmville

855
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,560
I guarantee you don't you have to like mow your lawn to earn points yeah you can crop

856
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,320
all the grass and you have to you have to do that like if you don't want to actually

857
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,800
take care of your real lawn in real life you can mow your digital lawn well it's just like

858
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,200
okay not to get too tangeny too late but we went to go visit my mother this week because

859
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,440
it was my dad's birthday and you know my mother's a very animated character and she was talking

860
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,900
about her friend that plays Farmville right and what was she telling us about her friend

861
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,960
like her friend is afraid to leave the house she was going on vacation and she had to give

862
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,920
her daughter because I think this was a retired aged woman had to give her a 70 year old woman

863
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,080
had to get her 71 had to give her grown daughter her Facebook password so that her daughter

864
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,580
could log in once or twice a day to click on all of the farm to feed her chickens to

865
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:41,920
feed the chicken or they might die yeah she didn't want her farm to lose the progression

866
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:48,180
of points when she was on chickens yeah Farmville chickens I mean that's like what these games

867
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:53,340
have become to some people and if the chickens ever do die she could just take out a credit

868
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,800
card and buy five dollars worth of Zinga bucks and just respawn her chickens that's how they

869
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:05,060
make money yeah taking advantage of I'm very I'm very proud of my mother for not getting

870
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,140
sucked into all that she does she always she's very staunch I'm not getting on Facebook no

871
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:14,980
one wants to see my face but I don't know if I should say this on the show but she she

872
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:22,780
got she's on don't ask do not ask me she's on Twitter she got a Twitter account and she

873
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,440
asked me how to upload her picture to her Twitter account and she's following like Rosie

874
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,920
and and what share and stuff on Twitter and it's really cute but yeah she doesn't want

875
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,600
me I told her I would plug her Twitter and would get her some followers but she doesn't

876
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,100
want it she doesn't she she gets creeped out by people following so don't try to find her

877
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:44,800
guys she doesn't want to be found so but she's she's on there and it's really really funny

878
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,100
so I'm proud of my mother for finally embracing technology because for the longest time she

879
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,340
was one of those people that thought the CD-ROM drive was a coaster why are you paying two

880
00:50:53,340 --> 00:51:00,140
hundred bucks for the coaster so anyway let's move on then that's it for our gaming weeks

885
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:24,160
on Twitter so I guess that's it let's get into this week's gaming news after plenty

886
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,380
of talk of last week's news and our antics this week let's finally talk about what's

887
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:34,020
going on this week Loki this weekend was the call of duty XP event in LA it was kind of

888
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:40,500
their call of duty con if you will where they were talking about the new elite service and

889
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:47,700
also the hardened edition of modern warfare 3 so the first thing we're going to talk about

890
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:52,540
real quick is the hardened edition which thankfully this year it is only one special edition no

891
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:58,700
prestige this time around no RC car that's way overpriced or some cheap ass night vision

892
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:06,340
goggles that really are just some toys this time you get basically the game plus is a

893
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:13,580
field guide that it's over a hundred pages some avatar clothes or did you know animated

894
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:20,700
theme if you're on a PlayStation Network also one year of call of duty elite membership

895
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:31,100
which is apparently a $50 value and all that's gonna run you 80 bucks and I have to say you

896
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:39,300
know I did watch the least a part of their streaming coverage of the one they're talking

897
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,620
about the multiplayer and the elite service and I gotta say man they they really have

898
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:49,980
got their shit together as far as how to do an online community and how to give the fans

899
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:55,020
what they want for that it's it's kind of interesting because like you know what they're

900
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,980
not going to do too bad without infinity Ward I mean the old infinity Ward there's still

901
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:04,780
infinity Ward but in the game out but it's not all the old people from infinity Ward

902
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:08,700
but they got their shit together as far as online community and that's really what's

903
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,180
going to stand them apart from battlefield 3 elaborate a little more like why why is

904
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:18,140
it so awesome well there's a bunch of stuff to the offer for free and it's all on this

905
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:24,180
basically you can create clans you can you can it links in with Facebook you can find

906
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:31,460
your friends on Facebook and build to play games with them you can join up groups that

907
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:36,660
are necessarily like say for example I'm a fan of the Giants or something like that I

908
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:40,420
can play with other Call of Duty players that are fans of you know the San Francisco Giants

909
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:48,180
or whatever so nothing I'm a Giants fan I hate sports but they have that kind of stuff

910
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:55,060
they have where you can break down you can see what other players loadouts are like say

911
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:59,620
for example you you know playing against somebody and somebody kills you and you can see you

912
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:03,380
know you can pull up all this information all the hotspots on the map you can see what

913
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:07,480
their loadout was you can try their loadout if you want you can create your own game modes

914
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,380
you can upload those share them with friends they can tweak them they can you share them

915
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:20,300
back again you can capture 30-second clips and post them up in HD to share with friends

916
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:27,820
you can compete in tournaments you know for real prizes that of course that's the paid

917
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:32,800
service and they're gonna have different tournaments based on people's skill levels so it's not

918
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:40,580
gonna be just all you know crazy Call of Duty elite players and stuff like that they also

919
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:47,540
with the elite service you're gonna be able to get all the download content for for free

920
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,860
and you're gonna be able to get it first so they're gonna put out download content every

921
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,620
month instead of every quarter like they normally do everybody else you know that's not paying

922
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:59,660
for the elite service or doesn't buy the hardened edition you have to pay for that separately

923
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:06,580
and that's 60 bucks if you were to buy all that on top of you know the membership or

924
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:12,020
without the membership I guess so lots of it just is interesting and lots of different

925
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:17,220
you know game modes and basically just kind of they retweet you know their whole perk

926
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:22,220
system and stuff like that and it just sounded interesting for someone that I'm not really

927
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:26,420
into the series at all I mean it's just for me it feels like if I hadn't been playing

928
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:30,820
the first one and haven't been playing solid like you know like I do with Grand Theft Auto

929
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:36,420
I'm don't really feel comfortable playing Modern Warfare 3 you know I probably could

930
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:42,300
it's just you know some of those players play you know Call of Duty like I played Grand

931
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,980
Theft Auto so yeah DDR Dalla Billinor Chatham is with you I'm just not interested in the

932
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,800
Call of Duty series so you know and I'm not really into those games as well but I can

933
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,340
also see I recognize that they're huge games in the industry and that more importantly

934
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:00,060
where this succeeds other games might follow do you see something like this coming to other

935
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:05,220
games I hope so I would love this for like Grand Theft Auto it would be awesome there's

936
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,540
not that many people that play Grand Theft Auto multiplayer which I hope changes with

937
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:15,860
the next one but you know whenever that may be sooner than you think I think next year

938
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:20,580
for sure but I mean it would be great I would love that kind of stuff and they kind of had

939
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,900
something sort of like that with the whole social club with Rockstar Games and stuff

940
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,860
but it's not really in game it's more of just you go to a website and you can interact all

941
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:34,160
the stuff whereas this is actually in the game you can do all that before with Black

942
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,100
Ops I guess you could do that on the website but now it's actually in the game and you

943
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:47,000
can do everything you can on the website which is pretty awesome so yeah I hope I hope they

944
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,420
do that and I mean if it as long as it delivers on what they say because honestly prior to

945
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,980
this information I would have said Battlefield 3 is probably gonna be the better game and

946
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:02,060
I still think you know they're two different types of games but I mean it looks Battlefield

947
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:07,940
3 looks really good so if they have you know some decent multiplayer you know community

948
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:12,540
features and stuff like that it still might be you know a toss-up between the two but

949
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:17,020
don't you think most people just end up with both probably you know what and there's nothing

950
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:21,100
wrong with that you don't have to draw you know pick sides or anything I mean this isn't

951
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,760
a competition it's just it's a competition between develop or you know publishers and

952
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:29,140
developers and stuff but when the players come involved it just whatever buy what you

953
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:36,380
want I mean this is you don't have to make a choice it's whatever so some other things

954
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:41,540
they talked about go with the elite stuff real quick mobile apps they're gonna be putting

955
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,980
out some mobile apps so you could check out what your friends are doing and make all those

956
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:52,020
tweaks and stuff on your iPod or iPhone or your Android or whatever PC so they're gonna

957
00:57:52,020 --> 00:58:02,940
have that as well other fun stuff let's see here's the basically the bonuses that they're

958
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:07,100
gonna offer customers the first subscribers will get a year's worth of download content

959
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,420
for modern warfare 3 and they're saying it's over 20 pieces of content and they're gonna

960
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:16,420
be putting out monthly content drops instead of quarterly and they'll include new maps

961
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:21,560
new game modes with you know the value being 60 bucks elite subscribers will have access

962
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:26,720
to daily and weekly competitions and events which will offer both real and virtual prizes

963
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,660
subscribers will be able to level up their clans in competition so that's kind of cool

964
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:38,300
and and also see they'll have eight times more video sharing capacity than standard

965
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:43,540
users they'll have access to expert strategy and analysis including tips on guns maps perks

966
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:48,040
whatever that was one of the other things I kind of liked is you can level up your preferences

967
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:53,540
on different weapons so instead of just leveling up your character if I use like a p90 all

968
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:59,260
the time I would get skills you know be able to put scopes on it or whatever you know different

969
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:05,820
modifications which is kind of cool they're gonna have elite TV which is this like premium

970
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:13,540
service thing it's gonna have different different like shows I guess like Friday night fights

971
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:18,020
which they're gonna I guess it's being produced by Ridley and Tony Scott and they're gonna

972
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:22,580
put like different rivals like okay they're this one week is gonna be like Democrats versus

973
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,700
Republicans or something like that and so you can watch the games play out and that

974
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:31,600
kind of stuff they're gonna have noob tube I guess which is some clips or whatever that

975
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:38,300
are gonna be kind of they're gonna have people making commentary on them including Will Arnett

976
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:42,860
and Jason Bateman they're gonna be smack targeting over I guess user created videos from the

977
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:48,140
game so I mean that's kind of cool and that's definitely unique content I would say but

978
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:52,800
you know is it for everybody you know is it for like someone that you know like me that's

979
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,620
not really in the call do you serious yeah probably not but it's it's definitely some

980
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,820
stuff to kind of go hey that's kind of you know I'll have to check that out and a lot

981
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:04,180
of this stuff was for free you know you don't have to buy into the subscription there's

982
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:08,880
a lot of that stuff that's already available for free and if you want that additional stuff

983
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,420
later on you can buy into it I guess or buy the hardened edition you get all that for

984
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:17,620
free and then finally the announced of course you know with a big game like that they're

985
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:24,660
gonna be doing an exclusive Xbox 360 bundle it's gonna come with a modern warfare 3 branded

986
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:32,540
console and couple controllers 320 gigabyte hard drive also custom startup and loading

987
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:41,060
disk sounds and that'll be I guess they're also gonna say those controllers are also

988
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:46,260
available separately for 60 bucks and they're gonna be doing a new headset which is also

989
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:53,260
coming out non-branded modern warfare 3 for 70 bucks that also is a Bluetooth headset

990
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:59,420
and those are the new Microsoft headsets now be coming out for $3.99 probably around the

991
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:05,620
same time as this the system. Interesting comment on our chat on chat.org.com ddrdollarbill

992
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:11,300
says should this shit really be taken that seriously and cyberbeast says to some people

993
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,020
yeah and I'm kind of inclined to agree with cyberbeast because I think I think everybody's

994
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:20,780
kind of got their thing even in gaming you know like I'm sure some folks paid an insane

995
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:25,980
amount of money to import those plastic instruments from Japan and the Bomani games that came

996
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:30,500
with that or a World of Warcraft game comes out in a limited edition that has you know

997
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,660
the uber book and soundtrack and all that stuff and people sign up for that and they

998
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:39,940
have premium services as well I mean I think either you have your thing or none of it's

999
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:45,840
really interesting to you you play a variety of games and like I said the $50 a year may

1000
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:50,300
not be your thing especially if you're already paying for live you know that's already money

1001
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:55,500
out of your pocket but a lot of the services on there are free so I mean check out at least

1002
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,700
a free portion of it because why not I mean if you're playing it it sounds like it'd be

1003
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:05,460
a good value but I don't really think a lot of people need expert tips or need to watch

1004
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:11,660
Will Arnett make fun of videos I mean no one really needs that right and the download content

1005
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:15,420
bonus is kind of cool because you're saving some money if you're planning on buying all

1006
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:21,220
the download content I mean they're just trying to make money on the digital end because they're

1007
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:24,620
making a lot of money on the digital side and then once again you know the the only

1008
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:28,860
thing that kind of leaves a sour taste in my mouth would be you know the fact that this

1009
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:38,500
company puts it out as Activision so yeah it's like yeah I really want to support Activision

1010
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,800
I will say that you know again I'm not really into the series but I'm looking at the screenshot

1011
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:48,660
of the you know hardened edition that is a lot of crap for a game that's a lot of crap

1012
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:52,260
but I guess if I was really into this series I'd probably buy it I don't know if there's

1013
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,460
a limited edition for Skyrim I'm probably gonna get it you know we all have our things

1014
01:02:56,460 --> 01:03:00,940
yeah there is it comes with the map they actually sign me up there's actually is kind of funny

1015
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:07,780
the limited edition for Lord of the Rings war north comes with a an arrow quiver a leather

1016
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:13,300
quiver wow that's awesome also of note it sounds like this Call of Duty Expo thing was

1017
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,500
kind of a success for them too oh yeah I think so I definitely will be doing next year so

1018
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,260
very interesting whatever the next game is all right well let's shift gears a little

1019
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:24,140
bit and talk about Nintendo they are doing an event of their own now you know Tokyo doesn't

1020
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:28,740
or excuse me Nintendo does not usually participate in the Tokyo game show hey they don't usually

1021
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:33,220
go and this that's no new news they're not going this year either but they are going

1022
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:37,660
to be doing a special press conference it's gonna take place on September 13th and that's

1023
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:41,780
two days before the Tokyo game show now some folks are kind of reacting to this with what

1024
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:48,020
could it be this could be a new 3ds maybe because there's always there's that rumor

1025
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:51,180
going around right now that there's that 3ds is supposed to have a second analog stick

1026
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:58,020
and all that stuff to which I say no no no that can't be true I mean it might be true

1027
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:01,740
Nintendo's always working on something all the game companies are working on something

1028
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:07,260
you bet you you bet your ass Sony's I station for it even though they're not sure that's

1029
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,980
gonna piss off a lot of people and you think you think that price drop pissed off a lot

1030
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:16,460
of people putting out a new system with six months you know with the holidays still to

1031
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:21,460
come I have no doubt Nintendo is working on the next 3ds model for 2012 or 2013 they're

1032
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:25,540
not gonna be okay let me put take it from the like the PSP they're not gonna add another

1033
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,900
second analog sick because now you're gonna have games they're only gonna work on the

1034
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:33,740
one system and not the old 3ds well there was talk about at having an add-on that would

1035
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:36,860
plug it I don't know how it would work but it would plug into the existing DS and give

1036
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:41,280
you the extra analog stick it could work it could work I could see how they could do it

1037
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,160
you could plug something into the back of there like what the charger usually goes and

1038
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,820
kind of have it reach what you're grinning that reminds me of the logitech rumor that

1039
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:55,860
they were making a UMD accessory for the PlayStation go it's kind of funny huh it's I'm grinning

1040
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:59,460
cuz it reminded me that story here's the thing I think people are freaking out Nintendo doing

1041
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,720
a press conference before Tokyo game show is nothing new they do this all the time because

1042
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,940
they don't participate in Tokyo game show and what does Nintendo have going for them

1043
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:10,640
right now I already told you they're not gonna show the Wii U again I bet you that wasn't

1044
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,380
at PAX was it that's one I don't think so that's one thing I did call right they didn't

1045
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:17,620
show the Wii U at PAX something this show they don't have anything it's like a proof

1046
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:23,260
of concept still yeah exactly it's too soon so they're not showing it now either and they're

1047
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,020
not taking it Tokyo game show and it's not this so what else does Nintendo have going

1048
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:31,220
on right now the 3ds so this is probably where they're going to announce what we have to

1049
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:36,120
look forward to in 2012 whatever that might be I don't know it's probably too early to

1050
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:43,500
say so but I don't think a redo of the 3ds is one of them now if here's what I am here's

1051
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:48,980
what they could do is if it's true that they're going that direction they could announce the

1052
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:54,840
plug at this Tokyo like whatever plug is going to give you that second analog stick they

1053
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:59,460
could announce that and if that's announced then you fucking know what a new systems coming

1054
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:04,340
out in 2012 but I just my gut tells me no I think they still have to really prove this

1055
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:09,200
for you know it's kind of like one of those they've they've put it out there they need

1056
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:15,500
to stand behind it it's not good why why why would you do that because that's basically

1057
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:19,540
saying you know what we fucked up we should have put a second analog stick on there no

1058
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:24,500
you can't do that six months out you know you just say you know what damn it you know

1059
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:28,260
we should have put a second analog stick on it well our next console is going to have

1060
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:34,860
to have one you know it people will live I mean the PSP did just fine one analog stick

1061
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:40,420
granted it's suck you know that they're you know some games have to use the buttons to

1062
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:46,380
have a second analog stick but you know what we can use the touchpad as much as I hate

1063
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:50,780
doing it as a second analog stick or just make games that don't require a second analog

1064
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:56,860
stick gripper oh one in our chat room says pretty assuredly he's she he says it's a mother

1065
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:03,220
collection for the 3ds hi I wish my friend I don't think so yeah yeah they're gonna be

1066
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:09,720
announcing that also it's gonna be bundled with last story and you know I I would say

1067
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,940
so they're probably just gonna like focus on Kingdom Hearts maybe give a date for Kid

1068
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:18,900
Icarus and some of the stuff we already know about and maybe like a new Nintendo we have

1069
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:24,380
it there right now are no dates for Kid Icarus and the two Mario games well then maybe that's

1070
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:27,380
what we're gonna hear we're gonna get some dates finally I think that's what you're gonna

1071
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:32,820
get out of this and maybe a teaser of some Nintendo franchise coming back on the DS in

1072
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:37,360
2012 I would think like zero the fanboy in me really wants to say f-zero but not with

1073
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:42,320
Mario Kart still not out fan f-zero is still a ways out Pikmin seems like a pretty logical

1074
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:48,340
choice some type of Pikmin game or like a Donkey Kong on the on the 3ds they those seem

1075
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:55,860
like very logical candidates especially Pikmin Actraiser 3 he's trying to do to me don't

1076
01:07:55,860 --> 01:08:04,140
troll me all right other speaking of we screwed up so forth the ambassador program some more

1077
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:07,140
details came out on that we kind of referenced it at the top of the show but if you didn't

1078
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:11,220
hear the free Nintendo games are now available to those that bought the 3ds they came out

1079
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,740
a little early actually they came out the night before they were supposed to and I think

1080
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:20,260
that's because it was the first in Japan it was like the you know the 31st of August here

1081
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:25,140
and the full list of games that you can get for free NES games Super Mario Brothers Donkey

1082
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:31,020
Kong jr. balloon fight ice climber Legend of Zelda Metroid NES open tournament golf

1083
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:36,940
wrecking crew Yoshi and Zelda to the adventure of link those are the games that came out

1084
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:41,780
Yoshi by the way is not Yoshi's cookie it but it's a different puzzler it's it's kind

1085
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,820
of crap it's the one where Mario was on the bottom and you can flip the things around

1086
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:50,180
and you line up the characters and a little Yoshi eggs it's bad I played it I was like

1087
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:54,580
oh this was not a good puzzler game they kept trying to it's like they had really good success

1088
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:58,980
with Tetris and then dr. Mario isn't it a columns clone and columns isn't very good

1089
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:04,760
either I guess it's kind of like columns but not really Mario's at the bottom and he flips

1090
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,900
these platters around and that's that's what you're doing but I don't know I don't want

1091
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,340
to talk too much about Yoshi it's not worth your time they really should have just done

1092
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:16,140
dr. Mario see ya but you have five I would say in that list you have like five epic Nintendo

1093
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:23,980
games Mario Brothers Zelda Zelda to Metroid and out of Donkey Kong jr. balloon fight an

1094
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:28,620
ice climber probably one of those you go that's epic too is something that speaks to your

1095
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:35,980
interest and then the rest of those stinkers but you know whatever again but whatever I

1096
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:39,860
don't think I still I still to this day say Nintendo really didn't have to do anything

1097
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:45,320
yeah so for them I mean when you early adopt this is the risk you take and so I think it's

1098
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,900
neat that the games are out and that I didn't have to pay for them and I look forward to

1099
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:52,780
the advanced games as well but having metroid in my pocket is kind of rad not gonna lie

1100
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:58,000
it's kind of nice so looking forward to seeing how that multiplayer and all that stuff pulls

1101
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,020
out because it might make a game like ice climber way more fun to be able to like actually

1102
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,660
play that are they adding that later on I think so they were supposed to be doing that

1103
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:08,380
for the NES like same room multiplayer but no longer with the cords that you had on the

1104
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:13,740
Gameboy old school and all that and then of course as I already mentioned there are rumors

1105
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:19,340
about a redesigned 3ds it's coming from a French website 01.net and normally you would

1106
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:23,780
write that off as oh well who cares it's just some website to know what they're talking

1107
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:28,780
about however I believe this is the same website that talked about what else did they blow

1108
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:33,580
the lid on before they broke the Wii U and they broke the PS Vita and those specs so

1109
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:38,380
it's kind of one of those they were right on these so take this early this but that's

1110
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:43,460
where the whole rumor of the second stick comes from this the second analog stick rumor

1111
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:49,620
for the PSP original plague to that console for years and years and eventually there were

1112
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:53,460
leaked photos of what if they were all fake I can see him doing if they want to do like

1113
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:57,980
an Excel or something like that that doesn't piss me off big deal so it has a larger screen

1114
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:02,940
you know I'll I'll get over that but you know the change it so much to where oh we're gonna

1115
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:08,460
play a second analog so come on that's that's gonna piss people off yeah it's like the expression

1116
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:13,740
you've made your bed now lie in it you know Final Fantasy 14 and they're not just coming

1117
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:18,500
out with a new game yeah I mean it's just like well shouldn't this been part of the

1118
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:23,180
it's just like it's not as bad as like Wii motion plus or something like that but it

1119
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:27,220
is pretty bad it's like yeah we really should have had these extra sensors in there but

1120
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:31,900
we want to drop the crap you know the cost of this but now we're just like yeah we're

1121
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:36,580
gonna fuck you guys so um what made him change their mind though if this is true I still

1122
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:42,060
I mean I realize this website has a record and so forth you know people have said the

1123
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,820
same thing about us like why believe them when we were right on something early but

1124
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:50,340
um I don't know I there's still a big grain of salt I'm taking this with but I feel like

1125
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:55,100
well why would they suddenly change their mind maybe it's developer pressure maybe because

1126
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:59,380
the lack of games you know there's been a lack of games in the beginning here maybe

1127
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,540
it's because they're worried that they're not gonna be able to you know port the hardcore

1128
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:07,220
games over like some of these first person shooters or whatever the you know like a Call

1129
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:12,700
of Duty you know Modern Warfare 3 is not gonna be able to be on that because we're not gonna

1130
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:17,900
be sitting here after Christmas going there's a lack of games on the 3DS how could you be

1131
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:22,980
you have Mario Kart Mario Kid Icarus all coming out by the end of the year and a bunch of

1132
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:27,100
third party stuff those are pretty strong games and it's gonna be enough for the 3DS

1133
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:30,620
granted it should have been what the system launched with but whatever 3DS is gonna be

1134
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:34,980
in a much better position come December than it is currently you know what I mean like

1135
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:38,660
it's like I feel like this whole like there's no games for 3DS that's that arguments gonna

1136
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:44,980
get old at the end of the year and it's gonna be difficult to you know I wouldn't think

1137
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:50,140
that they would announce like a revision to their system right before the holiday yeah

1138
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:54,180
what that would be shooting yourself in the foot for real that would be just dumb of them

1139
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:59,740
to do but again like I said a minute ago they could be working on that and this French website

1140
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:03,940
might be right but that doesn't mean that's what they're announcing before the Tokyo Game

1141
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:07,700
Show Nintendo always does a press conference before the Tokyo Game Show because they don't

1142
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:13,820
participate I'll tell you what they're doing they're doing some sort of bundle it's like

1143
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:19,180
oh look it's a Mario console with Mario okay yeah that makes sense I'm with you yeah absolutely

1144
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:24,260
did they already announce something like that really and that's a red console but yeah I

1145
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:28,540
bundle makes sense perfect sense and I think I think there will be a tease of a new game

1146
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:34,660
in 2012 yeah we still have that Smash Brothers game and I want to play and this is weird

1147
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:39,900
I want to play that Lego City stories because that is fucking Grand Theft Auto I recognize

1148
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:43,940
Grand Theft Auto I played enough Grand Theft Auto to know what Grand Theft Auto is and

1149
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:48,220
that's fucking Grand Theft Auto and it also has the same moniker as the PSP Grand Theft

1150
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:52,300
Autos hold on a minute you don't care that it's Lego though and it's made by rockstar

1151
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:58,060
games I'll play that shit all right fair enough by the way we have some comments in our chat

1152
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:04,020
room going back to talking about the games that were in the ambassador pack let's see

1153
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:09,660
balloon fight act F says balloon fight is awesome and Sonic m88 says I love balloon

1154
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:13,780
fight and orange right says balloon fight is only good for balloon trips there's there's

1155
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:18,460
a lot of love for balloon fight in the chat and some some some in the middle of the road

1156
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:23,020
but yeah balloon fight if you never played it is basically Nintendo's joust ripoff you

1157
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:26,900
know joust the game where you you'll flap a little birdie it's like that but with balloons

1158
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:31,200
but yeah what made the game stand out was that it had this mode called balloon trip

1159
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:38,020
where now imagine joust as a side scrolling game that's what balloon trip is except it

1160
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:42,920
scrolls the wrong way too which is interesting it scrolls the other way but I think it's

1161
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:52,100
I think it's neat so all right so let's move on with some more news so I should pop a former

1162
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:58,300
take to interactive employee is suing them and is also trying to scrape up some other

1163
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:04,260
people that might have the same grievances as him for a class action suit is suing them

1164
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:11,540
for unpaid wages when he was a employee in their quality assurance department which is

1165
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:18,820
based in California and basically saying he worked overtime didn't get paid for it doesn't

1166
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:23,640
really say how he left the firm whether if he was laid off fired or quit but he says

1167
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:29,740
that there's a lot of unpaid wages owed to him and other people in the QA department

1168
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:34,640
that he's trying to get together for the class action suit also in the state of California

1169
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:41,060
they're very strict on if you work eight hour days you have to get a 30 minute lunch like

1170
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:44,900
by law legally they have to give you that and also breaks 15 minute breaks every couple

1171
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:49,740
of hours he's also saying he's saying that they basically said too bad so sad for you

1172
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:53,580
you don't get those lunches and breaks because of crunch time where they had to get a game

1173
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:58,020
out the door so I guess the QA department was written really hard and he's trying to

1174
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:03,740
sue them for the fact that they had that department run with no lunches or breaks and had people

1175
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:10,180
who weren't salary their hours hourly employees not getting paid for their overtime and he

1176
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:14,940
worked he started working there in December of 2006 it doesn't say when he left the firm

1177
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:20,660
and the case the original complaint was filed in June of 2010 so this is already a little

1178
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:25,420
over a year old but legal things are always so slow I always go to snail's pace and it

1179
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:31,540
looks like it hasn't been thrown out or anything so this may actually go to trial you know

1180
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:36,660
he's trying to scrounge up multiple people to both strengthen his case and also to get

1181
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:40,540
the class action thing going I kind of hope it does go to trial because I feel like I've

1182
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:45,180
got nothing else to say on this because I'm not in this dude's shoes you know and it's

1183
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:48,200
one of those cases where I think there's always you know there's three sides to every story

1184
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:54,420
right your side my side and the truth right and so I'm I kind of want something like this

1185
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:58,280
to go to trial just so we can kind of hear like I know we always hear those horror stories

1186
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:03,700
in the industry about you know what these claims he's making totally seems legit based

1187
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:11,460
on other things we've heard from other companies when I worked in a call center when we had

1188
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:18,620
you know like in a call center your your company has these service level agreements like you

1189
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:22,420
won't be on hold for more than two minutes all that bullcrap our wait times were like

1190
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:28,940
40 minutes so our metrics were total shit show and I was working 10 hour days and basically

1191
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:32,380
they said we're going to put you down for a 30 minute lunch but if you could only make

1192
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:39,900
it 20 eat fast and you know could you do that because we're really short on call coverage

1193
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:43,940
you know that's the kind of shit they pull in real sweatshop environments like a QA Center

1194
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:47,420
where you've got all of these testers trying to get a product out the door because it has

1195
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:52,100
to go gold in a certain amount of time I think basically what I'm saying is I've experienced

1196
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:58,580
that firsthand where I've worked at a job where management was like can you can you

1197
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:03,580
eat at your desk while working also this is such a tricky scenario because you do want

1198
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:07,380
to say you know yeah stick it to the man stick it to the corporation so forth and these things

1199
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:10,420
should be fair but then you kind of also look at the other hand and go well they'll probably

1200
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:14,020
just turn around out sources to another country because that's unfortunate where a lot of

1201
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:18,280
these jobs are going and I don't want to get too political and so forth but I mean that's

1202
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:24,260
just the world we're in right now you know what I mean and we've even heard of QA jobs

1203
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:30,460
being outsourced and so forth and I at the same time I don't think that it's right that

1204
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:36,180
somebody has to not claim time or you know not say the accurate time they worked or what

1205
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:41,060
have you but I think there needs to be better foresight in the planning of games and it's

1206
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:47,740
oh shock and awe mismanagement in all of these cases right mismanagement bad staffing planning

1207
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:52,780
bad you know what a shocker well yeah it's because the managers they're managing these

1208
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:59,020
employees probably get paid on how early the game is done and they get a bonus based on

1209
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:04,660
that so they want their bonus to be big because it's all about their pocket money and people

1210
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:09,500
fear that if they don't comply you know what and and such pop when you were in that situation

1211
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:15,780
what were you gonna do tell them no well in my case when I had to work the mandatory overtime

1212
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:21,780
I was paid for it but um yeah it's like this is really shitty and I want to walk out of

1213
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:25,740
this building for 30 minutes and clear my head but I can't because they're basically

1214
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:30,100
telling me that I don't get a lunch but I got rent to pay I got to pay bills I'm not

1215
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,540
just gonna flip them off and quit your job will end up overseas if you don't do it yeah

1216
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:41,020
so and that's like that's that's the real problem that's and is there an easy answer

1217
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:46,020
I don't know but I guess the the fact that this guy is making such a big complaint it

1218
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:52,020
sounds like this is a pretty widespread you know supported by management abuse of an entire

1219
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:56,860
department rather than you know an ugly week where they had to do sketchy things it sounds

1220
01:19:56,860 --> 01:20:00,660
like this was just really and the release the case that he's trying to present is that

1221
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:06,300
they you know it was run that the QA department was run very terribly based on on how long

1222
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:09,540
we've been doing this show or how long you all have been listening in the stories we

1223
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:13,660
read week in and week out about what happens in the gaming world does this lawsuit surprise

1224
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:22,380
anybody any anyone surprised now why not just comes with the industry exactly but does that

1225
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:29,120
make it right no well also um so he he's an ex take to interactive employee the division

1226
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:36,300
that he was in is now called visual concepts formerly 2k sports that held the Sega sports

1227
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:44,060
licenses so I can imagine in a that QA environment if you know EA's BS they're putting out the

1228
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:50,540
new Madden or whatever they need to get their game out in time for what EA is doing so basically

1229
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:55,860
all of the sports games that take two has put out since 2006 those are the games that

1230
01:20:55,860 --> 01:21:01,380
would have been affected by this QA department so I could definitely see how you know if

1231
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:05,380
Madden comes out and your game is supposed to come out a week before and you don't make

1232
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:09,860
your gold pressing of it then that's Monday down the drain well let's let's see it go

1233
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:14,740
to trial I want to see I might might I want to see this case defended I want to see what

1234
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:18,900
happens I want to say that for once can we not settle out of court and let's let's do

1235
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:22,980
it the good old American way and waste taxpayer monies on the on an actual courtroom trial

1236
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:27,860
lawsuit because this is something I'm generally I would like to see how this plays out but

1237
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:33,380
it'll get settled they all do yeah if they take this unless this guy's totally full of

1238
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:39,660
crap and he doesn't have the documentation it very well could be and we just don't know

1239
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:44,500
but I think it says something that we look at this and we go yeah not too surprising

1240
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:49,620
right I mean so I think we're kind of saying well this doesn't sound like it's full of

1241
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:53,220
shit I mean it could be in this case we don't know this guy this guy could just be a bitter

1242
01:21:53,220 --> 01:22:01,660
Betty but we don't know that's why it has to go to trial so we can find out anyway let's

1243
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:05,740
move on with more gaming news oh yeah well we thought it was gonna be a short show tonight

1244
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:13,100
we're already an hour and a half into part a anyhow we'll go quick on you watch so Sony

1245
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:19,940
is talking smack about Microsoft yeah when when they're are they not basically their

1246
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:24,720
comment is publishers are getting the living crack or living crap kicked out of them by

1247
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:32,600
Microsoft according to Rob Dyer Sony's SVP of public relations yes he is an expert of

1248
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:37,820
everything that Microsoft does basically there is a recent interview concerning Microsoft's

1249
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:46,140
publishing policies basically the thing that he was pissed off about was Microsoft's content

1250
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:52,580
submission and release policy which forbids its games from being released first or with

1251
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:59,780
exclusive content on other platforms so for example titles for Xbox 360 must ship at least

1252
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:06,320
simultaneously with other video game platforms and must have at least or have at least feature

1253
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:12,940
and content parity on disk with other video game platform versions in all regions where

1254
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:17,380
the title is available if these conditions are not met Microsoft reserves the right to

1255
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:22,620
not allow content to be released on the Xbox 360 it's actually interesting for a few reasons

1256
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:28,300
because I know for a fact like was a Dead Space 2 and stuff they had you know content

1257
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:35,820
that was on the blu-ray version of you know the for the ps3 and that wasn't on 360 version

1258
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:45,180
you mean like what it was the HD remake of Dead Space the Wii one that they had you know

1259
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:51,980
the on-rails shooter one they had that and then also I believe on the battlefield 3 might

1260
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:56,860
have something there's is like the original battlefield 1942 I think was supposed to be

1261
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:02,180
on one of this it's a lot of EA games they'll do that where they'll have exclusive thingies

1262
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:07,420
so but we don't know if this is really true or not right this is according to their policy

1263
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:13,180
I don't know of course you know Xbox is defending them they're saying we're a little biased

1264
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:19,460
so obviously we're gonna look to our product or to protect our own space as best we can

1265
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:24,740
and get exclusivity in other words we're gonna bully the shit out of everyone so that we

1266
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:28,920
don't die it's like I think I think what Chris and other representatives at Microsoft are

1267
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:33,820
doing is protecting inferior technology and this is according to that Rob Dyer again if

1268
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:39,020
they I think they want to dumb it down and keep it as pedestrian as possible so that

1269
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:43,260
if you want to do anything on blu-ray or if you have extra content above nine gigs or

1270
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:48,140
you want to do anything of that nature you better sure as heck remember that Microsoft

1271
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:55,620
can't handle that I just bickering ballots it's almost like the exact same story the

1272
01:24:55,620 --> 01:25:00,060
salacious pop just read except this time it's not the manager it's Microsoft using their

1273
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:04,500
whole to strong arm developers to get what they want because they're out there in the

1274
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:09,680
marketplace more than PlayStation but see here's here's where I kind of question this

1275
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:14,900
whole thing I have a big question mark about this not just the examples you gave but Japan

1276
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:21,540
Microsoft can't get away with this in Japan no how could they possibly and maybe even

1277
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:24,900
Europe I don't know what the sales numbers look like in Europe but I think you know America's

1278
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:29,620
the only place for the Xbox really dominates the ps3 and that gap is closing I think is

1279
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:34,420
important to note too so this might be Microsoft's way to kind of make sure that the Xbox doesn't

1280
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:39,540
die but it's going to have the reverse effect isn't it like I look at this ago this is just

1281
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:43,100
done this is already if this is already in effect I don't think it's really hurting the

1282
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:49,940
many I don't know it's just but if Sony were to do the same thing who loses the consumer

1283
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:54,740
well that's what here's what you didn't just do then it's pretty simple and they were done

1284
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:59,980
this is you put out free download content you put a voucher in in the game and you get

1285
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:05,140
free download content on PlayStation 3 it falls within all that no here's what you do

1286
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:10,740
you make your game for the PlayStation 3 and fuck the 360 I mean if that's if you think

1287
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:15,600
you've got a good enough game I mean PlayStation 3 is allowed to have good exclusives and they

1288
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:22,180
do have good exclusive souls and little big planet yeah but sometimes it it helps to have

1289
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:26,760
the whole market share of Xbox 360 as well because you know they have more of a market

1290
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:31,560
share than the PlayStation 3 and yeah there's good exclusives coming on to the PlayStation

1291
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:36,740
but I mean if it's that minor of a thing if you're just adding a few extra missions or

1292
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:40,220
whatever you can do is free yellow content it still falls within the requirements that

1293
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:45,860
they want and you can still market it as an exclusive I'm not trying to come off as a

1294
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:50,540
Sony fanboy either because I do love a lot of what Microsoft's done with Xbox I mean

1295
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:55,860
obviously Xbox Live Arcade is something everybody's trying to copy now Xbox Live set the bar and

1296
01:26:55,860 --> 01:27:01,100
so forth granted I liked Microsoft a lot more before my account was hacked for 125 bucks

1297
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:05,140
I've been able to play for three weeks but I digress there's a lot of things that Microsoft

1298
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:10,820
does right but the unfortunate thing is this type of act of desperation is almost what

1299
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:15,020
this sounds like I think that quote about trying to make up for inferior technology

1300
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:18,480
really hits the nail on the head yeah it's kind of like they're using their clout in

1301
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:24,860
the marketplace to bring the PlayStation down to their level because they're not capable

1302
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:29,260
of coming up to Sony's level hardware wise perfect example and I'm sure this hasn't been

1303
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:35,980
announced yet rage rages on one blu-ray on the PlayStation 3 rages on three to four DVDs

1304
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:42,620
on the Xbox 360 that sucks it's not a big deal I don't give a shit about this deal I

1305
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:47,980
don't give a shit fantasy 13 was on several DVDs didn't really change the game lost odyssey

1306
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:56,180
yeah wasn't it the atlas game Catherine that came out there isn't room on a 360 360 disc

1307
01:27:56,180 --> 01:28:02,540
for the Japanese dialogue with English subtitles so because they can't fit it on the 360 version

1308
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:06,820
they took it off of the ps3 version is that right or else or else the 360 words and what's

1309
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:13,260
gonna sell it think so because I mean I've seen you know ISO rips of that and Catherine's

1310
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:20,500
not that big a game it's like it's 40 45 gigs I mean they've got room but I I just think

1311
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:26,420
they didn't bother sometimes they just don't put the extra language track in there I mean

1312
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:29,860
a lot of video games don't put the Japanese language tracks in sometimes game fighting

1313
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:34,380
games and so forth do but you know the the speech in that is very short but you know

1314
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:38,780
most role-playing games out there don't and I don't have it's not an RPG but most RPGs

1315
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:42,660
don't bother with the second track it's actually kind of really cool when they have it there

1316
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:49,180
you know and you can play in either language but very rare right so anyway I guess we'll

1317
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:54,460
see if this kind of holds out to be I don't I want to say if it holds out to be true but

1318
01:28:54,460 --> 01:29:02,120
it I guess we are hearing it is kind of fact but you have some cases where it's not so

1319
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:06,180
yeah I mean I don't know when this one effect if it's just something that they just now

1320
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:10,940
put out but all I know is like I know that there's been titles and I think there's some

1321
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:20,860
that haven't come out yet I actually I know another perfect example for was it of course

1322
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:27,580
now that the titles of disappear Bioshock Infinite is going to have the first Bioshock

1323
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:34,060
game on disk for the PlayStation 3 version not so much on the 360 because they have the

1324
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:39,860
extra space for that but I know EA think had I want to say is 19 Battlefield 1942 I'm not

1325
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:43,500
sure if that was on the PlayStation 3 version of Battlefield 3 but one of these games is

1326
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:48,340
coming out had they did a few of these like that were had like another game on the disk

1327
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:52,700
because they have so much space Microsoft's got to be but I mean look Microsoft's got

1328
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:57,780
to be a little worried because it for the first time in this whole generation of games

1329
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:03,300
where it's been PS3 versus Xbox we were hearing a lot more favorable things about the or about

1330
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:10,860
the PlayStation 3 back in May was a May when Portal 2 and Mortal Kombat came out most people

1331
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:14,820
opted to get those games on the PlayStation 3 and that was really the first time you were

1332
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:19,500
hearing that because you had an extra character on the PlayStation 3 version Kratos right

1333
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:23,380
of Mortal Kombat and when it came to Portal 2 you had the whole steam integration and

1334
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:28,180
a free copy on the PC I mean which wasn't even remotely close to what the 360 could

1335
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:35,260
offer and again I'm not trying to dog on 360 360 is is proven the better system and then

1336
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:40,820
a PlayStation 3 in some cases but you know I think now it's going to a point where Xbox

1337
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:46,260
can't just kind of rest on their laurels of well we were the cheaper system for so long

1338
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:49,980
that more people have Xboxes in their houses than they do PlayStations because that gap

1339
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:53,580
is slowly closing at the end of the day it's going to be the games that speak for themselves

1340
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:57,380
it's going to take developers if these rules are true is standing up to these rules and

1341
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:03,180
saying forget it we can survive as a PlayStation 3 exclusive it worked for Demon Souls it worked

1342
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:10,660
for you know whatever other first-party Sony games are out there and 3d game heroes and

1343
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:18,300
so forth so guys you know in chat says la noir wouldn't have so much DLC if they ran

1344
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:23,940
it on PlayStation 3 only and maybe sometimes the DLC is part of the whole plan we're gonna

1345
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:29,300
get you to pay 60 bucks and then another 20 paid unlock exactly paid unlock content all

1346
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:34,180
right quickly let's talk about a Wii game that's right a new Wii game more information

1347
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:38,940
coming out on it tonight Square Enix is going to be revealing more information about Dragon

1348
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:47,460
Quest on Ustream at 2 p.m. Japan time September 5th that's 10 o'clock Pacific tonight so in

1349
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:51,260
about two hours they'll be starting that event who knows we might still be live at this pace

1350
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:56,260
tonight but they're probably gonna be showing more information on Dragon Quest 10 although

1351
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:59,960
it could be a new announcement they announced a long time ago some of you forgot Dragon

1352
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,580
Quest 10 is going to be coming on the Wii they said that back in 2008 but they have

1353
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:08,700
yet to show off anything about the game it's going to be interesting to see if they stick

1354
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:14,500
to their guns and they put this game out on the Wii relatively late in the Wii's lifecycle

1355
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:17,740
because they would have to announce this and really have a date ready to go relatively

1356
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:23,420
soon I worry it's gonna suffer a little bit from what Dragon Quest 8 suffered from and

1357
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:27,460
that was it came out he was on the ps2 right towards the end it was on the ps2 at the very

1358
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:31,500
very end and it's the same thing that hurt Final Fantasy 12 both those games came out

1359
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:35,940
I don't think very far apart from each other and both those games you know for the hardcore

1360
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:39,380
gamer got overlooked a little bit because everybody was putting 360s and Wiis in their

1361
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:46,180
homes and so forth just 360s and other new stuff 7 was ps1 right so they've been really

1362
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:50,460
like those games don't have really come out as often as they used to know and the Dragon

1363
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:54,860
Quest 9 was on the DS obviously and now 10 is you know was announced some time ago on

1364
01:32:54,860 --> 01:33:00,980
the Wii because for a while there especially back in 2008 it seemed like the Wii was everything

1365
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:04,700
it's going to be interesting to see if they stuck to that or if maybe one of the announcements

1366
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:09,460
we're getting today is and it might show up on other systems I kind of don't think they'll

1367
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:14,820
do that keep in mind Dragon Quest is still a very Japanese centric game yeah Dragon Quest

1368
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:18,980
9 everyone went clown shit for that game in Japan and over here like people that know

1369
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:22,900
what Dragon Quest is bought it but it wasn't the phenomenon that it wasn't that it was

1370
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:28,860
over there you can I bet your ass it's not coming out on Xbox period it's just not you

1371
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:36,780
know it's a Japanese game and Xbox is not what it is here PlayStation 3 I just don't

1372
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:41,500
think so I don't think they have a need to maybe Dragon Quest 11 probably not Dragon

1373
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:48,980
Quest 10 well I mean different studio obviously but through the 360 did have Blue Dragon which

1374
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:55,340
was by what mist Walker studio and also the artwork was Akira Toriyama who did Dragon

1375
01:33:55,340 --> 01:34:00,220
Ball Z and Dragon Quest so there's that connection there it wouldn't be unheard of it came out

1376
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:04,700
on the 360 because we've had a game that looks like it already true true all right so we'll

1377
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:09,100
see what happens by the time most of you are hearing this on the podcast actually we'll

1378
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:12,940
have more information on that so be looking for that on Labor Day by the way just real

1379
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:17,380
quick there is going to be a Dragon Quest 10 trailer in the Wii anniversary collection

1380
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:21,260
I mean this just really strengthens that yes they're committed to the Wii I don't know

1381
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:26,980
if you've heard but they are bundling I think it's 1 2 3 and the Super Nintendo remakes

1382
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:32,820
of 1 & 2 are all going to be on a Wii anniversary debt disc it's very it's like that Mario collection

1383
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:37,380
they did it's like that for Dragon Quest which is cool but it won't be it won't be on the

1384
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:42,380
U.S. to be fair though it's still more content that was on that fucking Mario disc hey Lisa

1385
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:45,980
you know what they put more than one game on there guess what Nintendo you could have

1386
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:52,780
done that those discs they can hold more than a Super NES ROM well it's just 1 2 & 3 I would

1387
01:34:52,780 --> 01:35:01,640
have loved to see that rip one meg it's like okay I'm looking for a disc I'm I wish that

1388
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:05,180
anniversary collection would come out in the U.S. actually I really love the first Dragon

1389
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:14,420
Quest game excuse me Dragon Warrior remember so all right anyhow that is coming out by

1390
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:19,700
the time most of you guys hear this so look for it so let's pop a couple weeks ago we

1391
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:25,800
we reported on a story about the video game history museum project and how they were trying

1392
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,660
to get the money they needed to get the thing off the ground the video game history museum

1393
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:33,460
is I think it's not like it's just three or four dudes that are running this and they

1394
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:38,460
usually have an exhibit at the classic gaming Expo in Las Vegas where they would have floor

1395
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:47,420
space for their video game history pieces and all the information there and they really

1396
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:53,180
wanted to give this thing a permanent home somewhere in the Silicon Valley near the San

1397
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:58,780
Jose sort of you know the southern Bay Area of California which of course is where Apple

1398
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:04,100
and Google and eBay and all of those companies are located I'm also I think EA is down there

1399
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:11,140
and I'd awesome so that's that's where it's going to be and their Kickstarter was a success

1400
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:18,980
and the story is that they are $20,000 over what they initially wanted I got the oh I

1401
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:24,420
had the Kickstarter page open but I closed it but it's like I think they had 700 donors

1402
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:34,140
and the target goal was 30,000 on their Kickstarter page and now they're at 50 something so yeah

1403
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:40,540
no real update yet as to you know whether like what what the building's gonna look like

1404
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:44,580
or if they actually have a space for it like bought if they're gonna buy the plot to build

1405
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:49,860
it on but yeah they made their money so hopefully within maybe a couple years we'll have a permanent

1406
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:57,800
video game Hall of Fame history museum in California for us to go to why remember kind

1407
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:02,180
of reporting on this a couple weeks ago and it sounded kind of cool at the time so I'm

1408
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:07,140
glad they kind of you know got their kinks worked out what have you so what do you say

1409
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:11,660
road trip actually I've seen their exhibit at Classic Gaming Expo before and it's pretty

1410
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:16,420
cool so I think it's neat that they're kind of going to have a place for this and if you

1411
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:23,580
go to their Kickstarter page which I can find and post into chat if you dare certain landmarks

1412
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:31,180
if you donate 10 20 $50 and so on there are perks that you get once the museum is a reality

1413
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:36,840
like a ticket to admission or something like VIP a ticket to get in first before everyone

1414
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:44,420
else or whatever yeah creative most most Kickstarter pages are like that right right all right

1415
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:48,060

1472
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:30,200
game of the week even though dark soccer is not here we're still gonna do one but first

1473
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:33,780
we have a couple more stories to cover let me actually read a couple comments from chat

1474
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:38,960
because during the release date some of our chatters were talking act deft found the size

1475
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:42,980
of the Mario collection on the Wii that Loki was asking about which is basically the lost

1476
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:51,500
levels ROM right act F says the American version of the game is 13.31 megabytes great waste

1477
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:56,860
of fourth you know was at 4,000 megabytes on a you know over 4,000 megabytes on a goddamn

1478
01:43:56,860 --> 01:44:02,140
DVD is seriously that layer don't forget some games like Mario Galaxy and Xenoblade are

1479
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:06,580
doing they should have put on a dual layer that just to be extravagant that this great

1480
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:11,340
there has so little on it you can literally put your fingers and rub it all over the disk

1481
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:14,820
and it would be just fine you know what you could do is if you you know if you were into

1482
01:44:14,820 --> 01:44:21,340
the the backup quote unquote you know what I'm saying you could do a GameCube size disc

1483
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:26,180
and put the ROM on that and load it off a GameCube disk but with the we know it was

1484
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:32,720
a we disk I don't know it's just that's pathetic is what it is they really should just really

1485
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:38,540
say no matter why you mad though and then lastly let's see a cyber beast is talking

1486
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:42,740
about I really need the Nyko or Nikko zoom that's the whole thing on the connect and

1487
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:46,700
yeah I got delayed wasn't supposed to be coming a hole would have been out already if it was

1488
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:53,340
coming out in time but it's September now well and Japan's getting it and I I want one

1489
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:57,880
too I it's I think so many people are interested in that and by the way if you haven't heard

1490
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:02,140
of that that's the thing that you can actually put on your connect and it will help a smaller

1491
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:05,300
room be more effective with the we like it's just it's basically like a wide-angle lens

1492
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:10,280
basically for your connect the connect and it's a great idea and I wonder if Microsoft

1493
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:14,500
isn't going to just kind of change the connect because it seems like one of the this is so

1494
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:19,460
badly needed you know so we'll see all right anyhow let's move on with a couple more quick

1495
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:28,460
stories for you guys Loki avalanche the developers behind the just cause series they have some

1496
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:35,660
comments regarding DRM they believe it's a threat to the entertaining experience basically

1497
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:46,540
was it a Christopher Sundberg he said if a DRM system constantly needs to be defended

1498
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:51,940
something must be wrong as a developer you will never win over any fans if you constantly

1499
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:58,420
let everyone know how much it costs to develop a game and how much money you lose I don't

1500
01:45:58,420 --> 01:46:03,860
like always on DRM solutions at all since they offer nothing to the consumer if you

1501
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:09,820
continuously give something extra for registering and being online and award them for actually

1502
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:15,880
playing a pain for and playing your game it'd be different but always on DRM says thank

1503
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:20,420
you for buying our game we trust you as far as we can throw you and yeah that kind of

1504
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:25,140
makes sense and I love how Ubisoft likes to spin it oh well you know what if you buy our

1505
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:31,860
game and this isn't even necessarily always on stuff this is I would say going to the

1506
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:37,060
the little codes that you have with your new games where you get multiplayer we're offering

1507
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:42,940
you free multiplayer with this code no you would have had multiplayer in there anyways

1508
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:48,020
but you're being a dick is what it is you just don't want people you know to be on your

1509
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:57,220
online service if they didn't buy the game new whatever I just it's stupid well isn't

1510
01:46:57,220 --> 01:47:02,580
it true that when all this DRM stuff kind of the person that loses is the people that

1511
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:07,820
are buying these games legitimately exactly and I I'm very curious and I will definitely

1512
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:14,220
be reporting on that how quickly the DRM gets cracked on driver it will be fast I guarantee

1513
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:21,620
it all right well before we get to the classic game of the week tonight we have a new segment

1514
01:47:21,620 --> 01:47:25,820
here on orange lounge radio because you know we just see we see too many new stories that

1515
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:30,140
are like this and so we just need to give it its own segment on the show and it's called

1516
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:46,060
local news making gamers look bad that's right local game for local news making gamers look

1517
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:52,420
bad and for tonight's local news making gamers look bad we're going to go to the station

1518
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:59,320
WSB TV channel 2 and where are they located they're in Georgia but I don't think they're

1519
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:03,500
in Atlanta station I think they're like northern Georgia so we're gonna get to a story that

1520
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:09,740
they ran this week that I captured some of the gaming blogs about pornographic drawings

1521
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:14,980
that were found inside a used Wii game and I know what you're thinking this isn't really

1522
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:20,220
a news story I really this makes it on the news yet no this is this is the whole point

1523
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:26,100
of this segment it's local news making gamers look bad so yes it does have to do with gaming

1524
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:30,220
because it's your local news station oh it isn't Atlanta station it's action news 2 in

1525
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:34,020
Atlanta oh Bobby had had a show tonight he would have been all over this this is in his

1526
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:39,380
backyard this isn't by the way the town and remember this in the back your mind coming

1527
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:45,100
Georgia and that's c-u-m-m-i-n-g like I'm coming right that's exactly where the story

1528
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:52,700
takes place so here we go pornographic drawings from action news 2 in Atlanta when a six-year-old

1529
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:57,940
boy found pornographic drawings inside the box of a Nintendo Wii game the packaging says

1530
01:48:57,940 --> 01:49:02,660
it's suitable for everyone channel Napier Viteri is live tonight in Forsyth County with

1531
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:07,600
the discovery parents were not prepared to explain Amy and I apologize for the audio

1532
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:12,420
is very very low on this I might have to fix it in post-production a little bit but again

1533
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:21,720
the local internet news is very not good at equalizing their audio so sorry Jervita Tracy

1534
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:26,260
Turner bought her six-year-old son this game at a local GameStop it says on the on the

1535
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:31,420
outside of the box rated E for everyone but what he found inside is for mature adults

1536
01:49:31,420 --> 01:49:37,020
only let's find this one Tracy Turner has a stack of kid-friendly video games for six-year-old

1537
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:46,400
JT and four-year-old Madison the kids are cute I'm not gonna talk bad about the kids

1538
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:51,060
and it's it's cute that they do have these Wii games that they play so her son pick out

1539
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:54,700
this game for their Wii system it's rated by the way it's this the game they're showing

1540
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:57,740
I don't know why they don't name it this is kind of like when the local news here did

1541
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:01,760
the story on us and then never named our station remember that they were doing the story on

1542
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,620
podcasting and they interviewed us but they never said it was Orange Lawns radio they

1543
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:08,980
just said these are three local guys that do podcasts about video games never named

1544
01:50:08,980 --> 01:50:14,300
it the game that they're looking at here is Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games okay E

1545
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:18,340
for everyone appropriate for all ages but when her son and some of his friends opened

1546
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:23,420
the box the images he found inside were anything but they were extremely inappropriate it was

1547
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:28,440
very of sexual nature Turner showed me the drawings on the inside cover they show sexually

1548
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:33,960
suggestive images and detailed human anatomy my favorite part is that they show and I realize

1549
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:38,000
it's a radio show but they're showing parts of the picture cropped yeah but they're very

1550
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:42,560
cropped so it just looks like it looks like these happy little faces and somebody does

1551
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:45,980
have some artistic talent here it looks like some it looks like someone just drew stick

1552
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:50,620
figures with like a giant dong or something on it with like it with like a sharpie marker

1553
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:55,660
exactly exactly not prepared for to answer the questions of what was going on in the

1554
01:50:55,660 --> 01:51:00,260
picture so Turner tells me she called GameStop to let them know what was included in their

1555
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:04,380
merchandise she says an employee thanked her for calling and hung up she even called the

1556
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:08,300
corporate office but tells me she got the same response it kind of shocking because

1557
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:13,300
I expected them to like have a little bit more of a reaction like I did oh my gosh that's

1558
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:19,420
bonus content okay you should be thanking us oh well didn't you know GameStop has the

1559
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:24,980
exclusive with Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games you get free wiener pics with every

1560
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:29,700
purchase how much sex goes on at the Olympics in real life okay I'll have you know that

1561
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:35,420
we should charge the extra for those wiener pics you bring it to us I apologize you know

1562
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:40,420
I'm so sorry you know like let me see you know like something else and we just did not

1563
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:45,620
receive that I took the game cover and went to the GameStop in coming wow this is investigative

1564
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:50,660
journalism and I love this shot of the reporter walking in the GameStop like I'm gonna go

1565
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:54,620
march on in there and get to the bottom of what happened here to the same employee who

1566
01:51:54,620 --> 01:51:59,180
took Turner's call she says no one apologized that you just said thanks for letting us know

1567
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:03,840
and then hung up I actually apologized to her five times I also called the corporate

1568
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:08,700
office and someone told me they would get back to me these compelling shots of the reporter

1569
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:12,980
on her iPhone like I'm calling them right now and I'm looking very intently at the phone

1570
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:20,900
motive I just wanted them to say I'm sorry I got an email from GameStop's corporate office

1571
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:25,340
this evening asking me for Turner's information so they can look into what happened further

1572
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:29,580
as for Turner she tells me from now on she's going to buy new games spend a few more dollars

1573
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:34,100
so she can avoid this happening again we're live in Forsyth County Amy Napier-Viteri channel

1574
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:39,060
2 action news Nightbeat that's it it's propaganda propaganda from the developers and the publishers

1575
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:42,700
of these games they're just trying to get people to think you know what if I buy used

1576
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:47,900
I'm gonna get fucking dick pics in my my games buy new no dick pics in new games here's the

1577
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:55,380
thing I I'm not making fun of the mother because she has a legitimate complaint yes she she

1578
01:52:55,380 --> 01:53:00,380
really does I mean the fact that it's on the fucking news in Atlanta is a little weird

1579
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:06,060
to me like okay but let's let's be real well let's let's just it's probably one of those

1580
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:11,580
things where she went to GameStop she got kind of like well thanks she got an apathetic

1581
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:16,780
and then so she went to one of those consumer activists you know that things and the local

1582
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:22,760
the local news feeds on that shit the local news feeds on that fucking like call the news

1583
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:28,060
center and and whatever show it is that works and sometimes you know they do they do help

1584
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:33,380
out like in cases of this isn't one of those cases that really need is like yeah that's

1585
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:38,700
unfortunate but but this is just a seized opportunity I mean for local news station

1586
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:43,980
this is really okay look at the what what does she want she wanted GameStop to fucking

1587
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:49,200
say sorry about that man like any of us in the GameStop employees shoes you know what

1588
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:53,260
to say I'm really sorry to hear about that ma'am if you wouldn't wouldn't mind bringing

1589
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:57,140
the game back to the store we'll get you a full refund or we'll get you a replacement

1590
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:02,300
copy Dan you're shaking your head no you disagree get Dan a mic it's like we did get Dan a mic

1591
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:08,140
you disagree that the woman who would have just laughed at her you would have been like

1592
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:12,340
you got a game with drawings in it you're stupid and then hung up damn well that's not

1593
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:18,460
what you would have done I would have actually cop to drawing him would you have done it

1594
01:54:18,460 --> 01:54:23,260
in a humorous way though no I don't know I would have had her if she was mad I would

1595
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:27,120
have just told her to bring the game but yeah exactly thank you Dan you bring the game back

1596
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:32,060
and we'll replace the game or give you I would have replaced the game I just would have wanted

1597
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:35,860
to see what was done on the inside of the cover come on yes you would you replace the

1598
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:42,220
game and or give her money back give her a different manual it's it's a used game anyway

1599
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:46,020
like fucking GameStop makes hella money on those games you could have afforded to give

1600
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:51,700
more that's added value that's like a deus ex coupon but better all right you're not

1601
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:56,420
helping Dan no no I never help all right but you know to be honest and now it's on the

1602
01:54:56,420 --> 01:55:00,660
local news because she didn't get that apology or that reaction that any one of us with a

1603
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:05,860
shred of customer service in us knows that she should have had just an apology yeah so

1604
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:10,060
it sounds like the GameStop employee that obviously looked at the bass back of the disc

1605
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:17,740
to make sure it was scratched when they took the trade in failed to notice the PP drawings

1606
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:21,140
on the inside cover that the previous owner drew in there when he wanted to get his five

1607
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:25,780
bucks used credit which you know okay wake up call maybe GameStop needs to be thumbing

1608
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:29,620
through those pages I mean I wouldn't have thought to oh I better look through the manual

1609
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:34,360
to make sure no one drew a dick in here you know and to be fair the person who probably

1610
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:38,500
drew it probably forgot it was in there like if you do something stupid before usually

1611
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:42,940
before you sell a game back like remember back when it was cartridges and like if you

1612
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:46,440
name your character cunt like you're going to erase you're going to have the courtesy

1613
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:50,980
probably to erase that file before you say oh all right some of you won't you get yeah

1614
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:55,780
you get a game from blockbuster and it's like boobs butts turd it's like Oregon Trail but

1615
01:55:55,780 --> 01:56:01,540
you just name your Final Fantasy six characters after it I'm sorry you know they're like how

1616
01:56:01,540 --> 01:56:05,900
old is six and four maybe they wouldn't know what's really going on but I would have like

1617
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:10,780
I would really ha ha that's funny yeah but here's my point guys is that is that this

1618
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:16,480
really isn't a big issue the woman has a legitimate complaint a manager needs to spank an associate

1619
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:21,420
at the front line of game stop here and this this could be done Dan but it doesn't need

1620
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:25,420
to be on the fucking news gamers are dirty ass people though and that well and that's

1621
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:29,860
what this new story is conveyed it's like gamers are all sex crazed maniacs who draw

1622
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:37,140
pee-pees in Mario and Sonic at the Mario's got a pee-pee it gets way better than that

1623
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:41,180
I cannot even tell you the amount of times I was pulling in a system for trade and I

1624
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:47,700
popped open the disk drawer and there was porn in it it was a lot and not like you know

1625
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:52,920
you know fake porn either like real fucking hardcore porn and you're just like really

1626
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:57,460
pal you couldn't have like open it up and pulled your you know your disk out and put

1627
01:56:57,460 --> 01:57:01,780
it away I just to get a reaction out of you though you know it was like people they were

1628
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:07,420
always like I can't believe oh my god you know you'd give them the disk you'd wipe off

1629
01:57:07,420 --> 01:57:13,860
your hands I swear to god I opened a disk once as a CD case and there was a cock ring

1630
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:21,220
inside I'm not even fucking with you and you can tell cuz it's got that funky latex e condom

1631
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:31,100
smell sort of thing going on oh my god close it is handed back said that's yours drugs

1632
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:37,160
there have been you know joints and shit in cases gamers are dirty ass people so someone

1633
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:43,220
graffiting inside their game cases and forgetting about it that's nothing PSP memory cards were

1634
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:47,380
awesome if you ever audited them the ones that we took on trade I bet you that like

1635
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:53,500
50% of them had porn on them we sold one to a kid once his mom came back she was so mad

1636
01:57:53,500 --> 01:58:00,860
at us she's like don't you check this it's like no take it home format it you know if

1637
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:04,060
you're if you're 14 year old decided he was gonna look around on it and keep it on his

1638
01:58:04,060 --> 01:58:11,900
PSP that's because he's a 14 year old who's not like LSD or something like that exactly

1639
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:16,180
so so you're saying you're what I'm hearing out of you Dan is that it could have been

1640
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:22,300
a lot fucking worse and this is nothing yeah gamers are skeevy fucking terrible people

1641
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:26,860
you guys all know you are all right we got a new name for the segment here it's orange

1642
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:35,720
lounge radio featuring Dan making gamers look bad I had a friend confide in me that he had

1643
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:41,620
to call Netflix because he wanted to send back his copy of there will be blood or kill

1644
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:48,740
bill 2 and he just accidentally put there will be cock yeah it no case it was like it

1645
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:54,740
was like it was like boner bros 12 return of the skater teens or whatever and he's like

1646
01:58:54,740 --> 01:59:00,820
I Netflix hello there's a movie on the way to you and their little return cardboard night

1647
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:05,100
I have the movie here I sent you the wrong thing and they're like oh this happens all

1648
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:11,120
the time we'll send it back how do you make that mistake like I would imagine the pictures

1649
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:19,640
a lot different between you know what what movie was it do you remember it was as far

1650
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:25,540
as a porn as far as porn names go it was not a tasteful one I'll put it that way I'm not

1651
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:29,340
the porn like the actual Netflix movie let's just there's a big difference between like

1652
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:37,220
sense and sensibility and sniffing balls like big difference between what those DVDs probably

1653
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:43,340
look like you know yeah and he was worried that there that the disc web whatever it at

1654
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:50,200
Netflix Netflix is all automated so it would have sent that on to the next person in their

1655
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:54,860
queue and they would have ended up on a local news so he did his due diligence and called

1656
01:59:54,860 --> 01:59:58,980
and said there's porn on the way to you but yeah this yeah this stuff happens all the

1657
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:05,080
time doesn't surprise me and I imagine the person who bought the sonic game at full retail

1658
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:09,100
you know was up late at night and like this game is terrible so he took the instruction

1659
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:13,320
booklet he's like here's what I think of this game he just threw a big dick this game is

1660
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:22,500
cock and then he put it away that's why what happened fantastic we need to go back to a

1661
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:29,380
time when gaming was much simpler and easier back before people were drawing penises and

1662
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:33,340
instruction manual I just kidding people have always been drawing penises and instruction

1663
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:37,580
manuals right it's a classic game of the week every week here on the program Dark Sakura

1664
02:00:37,580 --> 02:00:40,500
takes a trip into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks you all should

1665
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:45,660
be playing this week but she's not here so not this week so this week Salacious Pop is

1666
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:50,140
going to take a trip into Dark Sakura's gaming vault and pull out a game that he thinks you

1667
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:55,460
all should be playing this week Salacious Pop what is the classic game of the week I'm

1668
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:59,940
finally giving up the whole Sierra Online classic PC thing I've sort of written that

1669
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:07,100
into the ground so I'm taking it to Lagoon on the Super Nintendo all right let's hear

1670
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:17,140
some music from Lagoon so Lagoon got its notoriety because it was a RPG that came out

1671
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:23,260
near the beginning of the console's life obviously those of us that remember when this Super

1672
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:29,680
Nintendo launched there was Final Fantasy 2 or 4 that was a launch title the really

1673
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:35,180
big heavy hitter RPGs like Chrono Trigger Final Fantasy 3 didn't come until much later

1674
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:39,260
in this in the SNES's life cycle. Final Fantasy 2 wasn't technically a launch title but it

1675
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:43,380
would be that launch window it was it was the Christmas that turn that Nintendo loves

1676
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:49,080
launch window yeah so Lagoon came out within a year or a year and a half when there wasn't

1677
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:55,780
really much in the way of RPGs to play after you've beaten Final Fantasy Lagoon was a top

1678
02:01:55,780 --> 02:02:06,020
down sort of think like Zelda style game it was a pretty unabashed Wanderers of Ys clone

1679
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:09,900
before there was a Zelda game on the Super Nintendo it's important to say because Link

1680
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:14,580
to the Past didn't come out till that was like the next Christmas or the Christmas after

1681
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:19,500
and the Ys games which I think came out on the TurboGrafx-16 wasn't a system that most

1682
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:27,180
people owned really so Lagoon is pretty much a clone as it's sort of like Secret of Mana

1683
02:02:27,180 --> 02:02:34,340
that style of action RPG I played this game I didn't actually beat it I borrowed it from

1684
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:39,260
a friend and I played it for about a week and had to give it up give it back but uh

1685
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:46,140
yeah the plot is that you live in Wakeland which is a very lush beautiful world of you

1686
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:53,300
know water and everything and this evil wizard has been poisoning the water by the underground

1687
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:58,020
castle of Lagoon which is where all of the magical water comes from he poisoned it because

1688
02:02:58,020 --> 02:03:04,140
he wants to raise a big bad demon very cookie cutter JRPG plot line I remember this game

1689
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:07,660
very vividly I love this game too in fact I want to do this classic game at some point

1690
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:14,360
but it's very Zelda-esque and uh so yeah so you of course are raised to be the champion

1691
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:18,460
of light for no reason you're just raised to be this hero that's been prophesized you

1692
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:23,180
know so don't ask questions about the story this is Super NES RPG you are the hero of

1693
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:28,300
light and so yeah so the water's been poisoned the evil wizard has taken the castle of Lagoon

1694
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:31,940
out of from the bottom of the sea and he's made it float up into the sky you have to

1695
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:37,060
go eventually go from village to village and level up and beat dungeons and get treasure

1696
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:44,500
and eventually you go up to the final dungeon the castle and the opening sort of has a sort

1697
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:51,300
of anime intro or as much as you could do on the Super Nintendo and for those of us

1698
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:56,260
that are familiar with YIS the art style they have like the big anime bright eyes that were

1699
02:03:56,260 --> 02:04:01,500
that was in Wanderers of YIS so that's kind of how the art direction was a bit just a

1700
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:09,940
competent RPG not really groundbreaking it was kind of buggy a lot the boss battles were

1701
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:14,160
actually pretty hard if you didn't know how to avoid the little bullets that they would

1702
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:19,980
shoot at you so it was difficult until you figured it out this game also came out on

1703
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:26,260
the Sharp X68000 which was a Sharp PC home computer product that was released only in

1704
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:30,100
Japan I was saying nobody had that here yeah that only came out in Japan I think it kind

1705
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:36,580
of bombed there it only had a life cycle of a couple years but this was a game that came

1706
02:04:36,580 --> 02:04:41,660
out for that esoteric system so I'm sure that Dark Sakura would like that it was published

1707
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:51,060
by Kemco who also put out a lot of the Warner Brothers Bugs Bunny and Snoopy games I believe

1708
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:54,980
they also did the Drakken games Drakken and Dragons view yeah and that was one of the

1709
02:04:54,980 --> 02:05:03,740
also another Super NES RPG where it was kind of your option if you were an RPG freak like

1710
02:05:03,740 --> 02:05:07,740
me your options were limited I had Drakken my parents bought me Drakken when I got a

1711
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:11,860
Super Nintendo for that Christmas I got Super Mario World because it comes with it and Drakken

1712
02:05:11,860 --> 02:05:15,860
because that was the game that the Sears person told them to buy or Montgomery Ward or wherever

1713
02:05:15,860 --> 02:05:21,780
they bought my Super Nintendo so yeah so Lagoon if you've never played it it's a competent

1714
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:28,620
top-down action RPG that a lot of you know gamers my age ended up playing just because

1715
02:05:28,620 --> 02:05:35,220
you know any port in a storm and it wasn't terrible by any means one additional audio

1716
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:41,380
clip that I wanted to have you play is when you kill the boss you know you just hack and

1717
02:05:41,380 --> 02:05:47,780
add in a dies it had this this sort of shriek that played when you killed the boss and every

1718
02:05:47,780 --> 02:05:52,300
boss whether it was a robot or a dinosaur made the same noise let's play it and see

1719
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:57,460
if we can recognize what wave file this is so here goes the boss but you always skip

1720
02:05:57,460 --> 02:06:05,100
ahead a little bit to the actual path here yeah here we go he's exploiting this first

1721
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:15,140
boss by finding a spot in the back of the room here we go sounds like an elephant it

1722
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:20,780
is it is the wholesome stage elephant sound industry from Street Fighter 2 whether that

1723
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:25,580
came first in Lagoon copied it or probably what happened this actually happens quite

1724
02:06:25,580 --> 02:06:29,940
a bit in the gaming industry where there's these public domain sound clip files that

1725
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:35,100
you will find sometimes like you know how even public domain just like sound like archives

1726
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:39,220
that they buy so it's like usually there's little samples of like yeah boy or things

1727
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:42,900
like that that you hear like in a DDR song that then you'll hear later in a game somewhere

1728
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:50,540
else and it's really weird like I want to say one of the big DR songs you hear the samples

1729
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:57,460
somewhere else it's really weird Max 300 the fire that whole thing like those those clips

1730
02:06:57,460 --> 02:07:02,380
you hear those elsewhere so anyway yes I just thought it was funny that I didn't put this

1731
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:06,900
together at the time but you have the boss noise when you kill a boss is the elephant

1732
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:13,700
cry and awesome stage Street Fighter 2 nice but the the dungeons in this you know had

1733
02:07:13,700 --> 02:07:17,500
some pretty clever map design more clever than it probably had any right to you know

1734
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:22,780
you could get lost but it was a it was a pretty fast paced game you didn't really have to

1735
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:28,300
grind too much you just hit from town to dungeon and there was always something to do so all

1736
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:35,540
right good pick classic game of the week everybody Lagoon from Kemko Seika for the Super Nintendo

1737
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:40,340
although technically it was also released on the x8600 was the name of the sharp sharp

1738
02:07:40,340 --> 02:07:44,940
computer yeah over in Japan and there it is your classic game of the week good job Dark

1739
02:07:44,940 --> 02:07:48,340
Sakura would be very proud did you did you screen your pick with her in advance I know

1740
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:52,140
she she knew you were gonna do it but she know what game you're picking no I think she'll

1741
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:56,900
like it she'll approve all right we're gonna take a quick break here though guys um gosh

1742
02:07:56,900 --> 02:08:00,740
I thought it was gonna be a show short tonight part a has been two hours and eight minutes

1743
02:08:00,740 --> 02:08:04,600
it's like the longest part a I think I've seen in a long time so good thing it's a three

orange laundry calm when we come back after this break with more of orange lounge radio

1748
02:08:28,940 --> 02:08:34,100
welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio we are live here on this Sunday evening September

1749
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:42,380
4th of 2011 Labor Day weekend with the 426th episode of our program we're gonna we're running

1750
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:46,780
long to a little long tonight part a was about two hours I don't think part b will be quite

1751
02:08:46,780 --> 02:08:51,420
as long and we had a late start life tonight too which I know doesn't affect the podcast

1752
02:08:51,420 --> 02:08:55,700
ease but good thing it's a three day weekend let's just put it that way we don't have to

1753
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:59,380
get up early for work tomorrow during the break I had walked out in the living room

1754
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:03,580
and I watched Dan was watching some playthroughs on YouTube which I thought was kind of neat

1755
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:09,380
he was watching a Zelda link to the past which is a classic from the Super Nintendo days

1756
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:13,100
we need to really have a retro night back at the house salacious pop and play something

1757
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:18,540
retro and play through like I always kind of thought like I don't want to say it's weird

1758
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:22,080
to like watch playthroughs because I get the allure of that you know like who doesn't like

1759
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:26,140
to sit and watch someone else play a video game and the Internet's made that very interesting

1760
02:09:26,140 --> 02:09:29,340
where you can kind of do all that through YouTube and so forth but I don't know I like

1761
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:33,340
to kind of get my hands on and play and all that stuff and so I kind of want to do a play

1762
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:37,740
through Super Metroid or something retro I'd love to record a let's play and put on YouTube

1763
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:42,580
but I do not have the attention span you don't have the attention to that you too this was

1764
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:50,420
a short game 30 hours of let's play of Tetris you know I did a four block we're done we

1765
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:53,960
could do a let's play you want to do a let's play we'll do that someday it'd be fun pick

1766
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:57,340
a game that's only a couple hours we could do Metroid one I could be Metroid one and

1767
02:09:57,340 --> 02:10:02,660
about if I kind of remind what I'd have to do is I have to play through it the day before

1768
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:06,240
and then I could do a play through the night of and once I kind of remember where everything's

1769
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:09,860
at least one of those things you never forget but like you kind of want to play it one time

1770
02:10:09,860 --> 02:10:13,500
refresh your memory I could probably play through it in a couple hours once I just kind

1771
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:18,260
of remember where everything's at you know that amnesia game that's big on steam oh god

1772
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:22,700
where if you if you are in pitch blackness you go crazy and there's the scary monster

1773
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:28,380
that you have to hide from it the let's play of though of that of that game are hilarious

1774
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:33,580
because there are people that are just like in tears hiding in the closet scary it's a

1775
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:37,420
scary it's a scary and the for the people that record commentary of that what they're

1776
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:42,660
doing in the game amnesia let's plays look for the one on YouTube that has a couple hundred

1777
02:10:42,660 --> 02:10:48,100
thousand hits and you will laugh because this poor man he's he thinks that he's really dying

1778
02:10:48,100 --> 02:10:52,780
in real life he's very scared I need to find some sound clips from some of those and play

1779
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:56,440
them on the show I bet they're hilarious they're like the reaction videos to two two girls

1780
02:10:56,440 --> 02:11:05,620
one cup right something like that all right let's move on with some rapid fire news and

1781
02:11:05,620 --> 02:11:10,740
we'll start off with Loki can I give us some quick news yes there's some rumors I mean

1782
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:14,380
this is kind of a given that there will be like an epic Mickey tube something did pretty

1783
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:19,320
well but coming from a really I thought it didn't do too well from what I heard it pretty

1784
02:11:19,320 --> 02:11:25,860
well for a Wii game all right of course there there's some surveys going around asking people

1785
02:11:25,860 --> 02:11:32,460
what their preferred packaging for epic Mickey to would be and a little bit because some

1786
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:39,500
details are kind of derived based on that apparently epic Mickey to will feature Oswald

1787
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:47,380
the lucky rabbit as well it almost looks like as another playable character and you know

1788
02:11:47,380 --> 02:11:51,540
looks like it that they may do some sort of split screen with that as well and it looks

1789
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:59,100
like that Oswald can use his ears is kind of like a helicopter no real word of course

1790
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:06,100
you know one I'm sure this is maybe like a 2012 holiday game if it's being worked on

1791
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:14,220
right now but they're probably not happy that this leaked if it is holiday 2012 yes so yeah

1792
02:12:14,220 --> 02:12:17,300
I mean it's definitely something that they're working on could it be something where they're

1793
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:20,900
just gauging interest and it may not actually be being made at all or do you think something

1794
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:25,300
like this happens I mean because games aren't developed overnight so maybe this one of those

1795
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:29,740
things where the games are ready in development it's like you know I don't know about that

1796
02:12:29,740 --> 02:12:33,820
I would think they're actually working on it says like the the screenshot that they

1797
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:38,940
have is now we would like to show you a few more packages for Disney's epic Mickey to

1798
02:12:38,940 --> 02:12:43,900
video game please indicate which package design makes you most interested in purchasing Disney

1799
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:50,060
epic Mickey to I think the third one is the best out of those I agree with you yes which

1800
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:54,660
is just the two guys kind of it's not really an action shot everything else is an action

1801
02:12:54,660 --> 02:12:58,740
shot and that except that second one where they're kind of jumping off into the two you

1802
02:12:58,740 --> 02:13:02,900
can't really see their faces which is a little weird to me yeah I don't like the best shot

1803
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:10,260
third one's pretty good yeah here we are taking the survey all right what else this is kind

1804
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:15,740
of cool apparently cat or was it mad cats has announced that they're going to be doing

1805
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:21,660
some official licensed major league gaming controllers now normally if it were the case

1806
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:26,540
of you know the major league gaming I wouldn't give a shit about it and their fight stick

1807
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:30,360
it's expensive it just looks like one of the normal mad cats fight sticks that they put

1808
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:34,820
out for you know a street fighter or something like that that's fine but what makes me interested

1809
02:13:34,820 --> 02:13:39,900
though is actually their controller the controller that they've got out yes it's wired but it's

1810
02:13:39,900 --> 02:13:43,620
got a neat bunch of neat features like for example you're able to swap out the analog

1811
02:13:43,620 --> 02:13:50,500
sticks if you want and you can swap them between basically the playstation 3 and the xbox 360

1812
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:57,300
ones also you'll be able to swap out the d-pad and you can put in either playstation 3 or

1813
02:13:57,300 --> 02:14:02,940
you know the 360 d-pad that is awesome whoa whoa whoa whoa so I could have playstation

1814
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:14,420
3 controls on my 360 yes style controls I'm just I'm a little bit flabbergasted I'm partially

1815
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:19,700
kind of like why haven't we seen this before like the 360 would be great if it had the

1816
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:25,140
playstation 3's controller yeah and it also includes placement so like for example you

1817
02:14:25,140 --> 02:14:30,760
could put you know the analog sticks you can move them around or whatever if you want really

1818
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:35,580
Dan's saying they used to make a controller like that I just don't even remember old school

1819
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:39,900
playstation era no prices have been announced yet but these controllers include the base

1820
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:45,900
controller two pro module d-pads one that's you know like the xbox 360 one that's like

1821
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:51,380
the playstation 3 for analog sticks you know two that are like the 360 to they're like

1822
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:58,620
the ps3 two faceplates a matte finish or glossy finish a braided three meter cable that actually

1823
02:14:58,620 --> 02:15:02,960
screws onto the controller integrated weight compartment so you can adjust the weights

1824
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:08,440
on there it's getting more expensive and pro case that the whole thing is stored in plus

1825
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:14,420
they're saying that they're gonna be able to sell additional add-ons later on like customize

1826
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:20,860
you know analog how much they haven't said I do know that the fight stick is like 150

1827
02:15:20,860 --> 02:15:28,120
bucks so I would hope that this is around the same price as a regular controller although

1828
02:15:28,120 --> 02:15:33,140
I'd imagine it's probably around like 70 80 bucks yeah I was gonna say that looks 69.99

1829
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:39,060
right there that's not bad if it's 69.99 because regular controllers are 60 bucks so 10 bucks

1830
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:44,400
extra yeah that might be worth it yeah I'm uh yeah yeah and dark tattoo is in our chat

1831
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:50,140
room see saying see I thought Rob might like this considering the 360s d-pad is ass exactly

1832
02:15:50,140 --> 02:15:58,100
I I do like this actually interesting all right all right and then last but not least

1833
02:15:58,100 --> 02:16:03,620
dance central to the announced some tracks for that and actually some of these are pretty

1834
02:16:03,620 --> 02:16:10,660
awesome they had a way what is love oh my god yes it's awesome that by the that's that

1835
02:16:10,660 --> 02:16:14,140
song from the club guys the Saturday night live the night at the Roxbury that's what's

1837
02:16:21,980 --> 02:16:30,080

1838
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:36,580
a sure featuring little John and ludicrous yeah so not bad it's got a pretty kick-ass

1839
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:41,060
song list so far definitely interested in this game no surprise there had a way was

1840
02:16:41,060 --> 02:16:45,520
love that's gonna be easiest routine ever can't wait just pop your head back and forth

1841
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:50,080
that had if that's not in there this whole this whole game is a sham and I'm gonna write

1842
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:53,980
harmonics and tell them so they've got a head no head bobbing and what is love your game

1843
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:59,260
is they've got to have that at least in part of it I mean come on you gotta that it's only

1844
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:04,340
that song famous it wasn't the song itself right right all right well I got some news

1845
02:17:04,340 --> 02:17:09,140
for you guys it starts off with news on Zelda Skyward Sword there's going to be a $70 bundle

1846
02:17:09,140 --> 02:17:12,860
that comes I'm sorry to interrupt you real quick go ahead I was gonna say they do member

1847
02:17:12,860 --> 02:17:16,420
have that mode or maybe doesn't just answer you but where you can create your own routine

1848
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:21,820
so maybe I don't think that was in dance I don't think it's just dance damn it all right

1849
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:27,060
there's going to be a $70 Zelda Skyward Sword bundle and it comes with the Wii remote plus

1850
02:17:27,060 --> 02:17:32,060
it's a gold one that's good for those that never did buy a Wii remote plus including

1851
02:17:32,060 --> 02:17:35,500
myself I never bothered with the attachment or anything but this is one of those like

1852
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:40,380
all-in-one Wii controllers so IDK I might have to pick this up I'm not sure yet I'm

1853
02:17:40,380 --> 02:17:44,540
still not kind of sure how I feel about Zelda Skyward Sword but you do you have to have

1854
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:49,180
the Wii motion plus you really should get one of those I don't know if I'd spend the

1855
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:54,340
extra money well it's not bad I mean the controller itself is gonna be what 40 so I might as well

1856
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:58,420
get the game I just bought Wii motion pluses so you know a big deal my controllers a little

1857
02:17:58,420 --> 02:18:04,060
longer now just so you know it also comes with a CD from the Zelda 25th anniversary

1858
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:09,380
concert this all comes out on November 20th they are saying that the initial print of

1859
02:18:09,380 --> 02:18:14,860
both the Wii controller and just the regular game by itself will have the CD that's pretty

1860
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:20,620
cool and the gold the gold wiimotes kind of neat I guess if you're into color collecting

1861
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:25,060
burnout crash coming out of Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and the date has been

1862
02:18:25,060 --> 02:18:30,260
set September 20th and that'll set you back either 800 Microsoft points which is 10 bucks

1863
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:36,900
or $9.99 on PlayStation Network so you can save a whole penny radiant silver gun is coming

1864
02:18:36,900 --> 02:18:42,220
to Xbox Live Arcade and it's been dated for September 14th 1200 Microsoft points that's

1865
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:47,100
15 bucks no word on a PlayStation Network version but yeah it's it's not just a port

1866
02:18:47,100 --> 02:18:51,760
I believe this is like a little remake it's gonna have an online two-player co-op Saturn

1867
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:58,900
and arcade style game variants different graphical modes an Ikaruga scoring system it's gonna

1868
02:18:58,900 --> 02:19:04,820
say that was a big Saturn game when the Saturn tried to you know survive here and I think

1869
02:19:04,820 --> 02:19:09,500
that's a former or previous class game of the week oh I'm sure I'm sure Jamie probably

1870
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:13,860
has highlighted every treasure made game at some point so radiant silver gun on Xbox Live

1871
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:20,020
Arcade I know anybody who's a fan of shooters at all has got to be at least a little curious

1872
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:25,980
about this if not just downright excited so all right let's move on slice pop professor

1873
02:19:25,980 --> 02:19:33,340
Layton for we're getting it we're getting it soon we're getting it in October it is

1874
02:19:33,340 --> 02:19:39,480
called professor Layton and the last specter it is the fourth game in the series it was

1875
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:44,620
just announced that we're getting it on the 3ds even though it's not technically a 3ds

1876
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:51,380
game on October 17th and it's at the Japanese version of the game came out with a little

1877
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:56,580
sort of Gaiden side story thing within this within the same cartridge called professor

1878
02:19:56,580 --> 02:20:01,460
Layton's London life RPG we are getting that as well translated so we're getting the bonus

1879
02:20:01,460 --> 02:20:13,940
game along with the proper sequel this October and also in a quickfire news we have a bundle

1880
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:22,020
coming out for the Kinect which is going to come with child of Eden and the price point

1881
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:27,360
is going to be $150 I'm not sure if that's how much how much is the Kinect right now

1882
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:37,300
by itself retail 100 150 Loki do you know off the top of your head is it 150 150 yeah

1883
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:46,900

1884
02:20:46,900 --> 02:20:51,540
correctly yeah I'm not seeing a date on this story going out of me but yeah if you loved

1885
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:58,380
rez which is an amazing music and special effects game child of Eden it believe it or

1886
02:20:58,380 --> 02:21:04,980
not is easier to play with a controller but seeing how so yeah seeing how the Kinect interface

1887
02:21:04,980 --> 02:21:09,780
interfaces with the game is neat but yeah so the Kinect is getting the bundle game child

1888
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:14,900
of Eden soon I talked about this when I first reviewed child of Eden but I honestly think

1889
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:22,140
it's going to be better on the move but that's just me yeah and finally let's see if I can

1890
02:21:22,140 --> 02:21:30,980
pronounce this right d3 is coming out with new Oni Chimbara Oni Chimbara thank you game

1891
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:39,100
basically you are bikini clad Japanese school girls it looks like it's kind of a like a

1892
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:45,380
bastard on Dreamcast or Devil May Cry slasher game very gory you're basically bikini school

1893
02:21:45,380 --> 02:21:51,060
girls killing zombies and when you kill a zombie blood everywhere blood splash oh god

1894
02:21:51,060 --> 02:21:58,900
so much blood bikini and a cowboy hat yep and where it's an Xbox exclusive game coming

1895
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:06,220

1896
02:22:06,220 --> 02:22:11,300
but it sounds like something we do yeah oh yeah so if it comes out over there then maybe

1897
02:22:11,300 --> 02:22:16,980
we'll get the sequel here and babes killing zombies what's not to love and they're the

1898
02:22:16,980 --> 02:22:19,980
first game is kind of lame but the second one looks a little bit better because it's

1899
02:22:19,980 --> 02:22:23,540
not just zombies you're fighting it's like actual monsters and stuff so it looks a little

1900
02:22:23,540 --> 02:22:31,260
bit like a little bit like bullet which but not quite as cool all right I want to throw

1901
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:36,540
one more plug for the upcoming indie segment here on the show I'm was finally go figure

1902
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:39,380
the week we're not here I'm finally getting some bites on this so I think we're ready

1903
02:22:39,380 --> 02:22:43,900
to roll this out next week but I do want to say one more time before we roll out the segment

1904
02:22:43,900 --> 02:22:48,140
if you have an indie game if you're developing one or you know people who are and they could

1905
02:22:48,140 --> 02:22:52,940
be for a PC it could be for Xbox Live any arcade it could be iOS I don't really care

1906
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:57,060
as long as you're independent we want to feature more independent games here on the show after

1907
02:22:57,060 --> 02:23:01,460

1910
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:13,300
your game is worthy of being highlighted on the show in a new segment that I really hope

1911
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:18,020
will start next week because I did get several interested people like it's when it rains

1912
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:21,780
it pours right I wasn't getting anything for a couple weeks and a lot last week so I'm

1913
02:23:21,780 --> 02:23:28,140
really excited so we'll be getting into that very soon also one more plug for tweets tonight

1914
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:35,020
twitter.com slash o l r we'll be getting to those shortly but first couple more stories

1915
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:40,260
according to Howard Stringer he is saying that the PlayStation Network is bouncing back

1916
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:48,900
way Howard Stern the stock shock jock DJ Stringer Oh Stringer not Stern he is basically saying

1917
02:23:48,900 --> 02:23:53,380
the PlayStation Network is more secure and better than ever and added that the company

1918
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:58,460
is working to expand the service which has added three million new customers since the

1919
02:23:58,460 --> 02:24:10,740
attack and sales have actually increased relative to the pre-attack levels so interesting told

1920
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:20,260
you people would forget about it in a few months yeah well that's very not surprising

1921
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:24,900
that everybody's going to forgive and forget after a few months except maybe those people

1922
02:24:24,900 --> 02:24:31,180
who sold back their systems in a fit I don't know but I you know what I honestly think

1923
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:35,180
might be happening I think people stole all the Sony information has been using it to

1924
02:24:35,180 --> 02:24:40,020
hack the Xboxes like I think that's why the Xbox like I could swear I had different passwords

1925
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:44,940
on 360 and PlayStation Network but now I'm thinking maybe I didn't and maybe that's how

1926
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:53,060
my Xbox was hacked I don't know but just interesting so all right anyhow story for you guys about

1927
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:56,420
something that was announced at E3 this year that had a lot of people very excited it was

1928
02:24:56,420 --> 02:25:01,660
the PlayStation 3D display bundle yes remember when they were going to be selling the monitor

1929
02:25:01,660 --> 02:25:06,420
with resistance 3 for $4.99 but then when they were like actually we're not gonna put

1930
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:10,460
resistance 3 in there we're gonna put a motor storm apocalypse in there and some retailers

1931
02:25:10,460 --> 02:25:14,140
were like well fuck you we're gonna be of resistance 3 anyway so that way they pre-order

1932
02:25:14,140 --> 02:25:21,500
with us well actually this is interesting Sony has apparently made this their plan the

1933
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:28,340
whole time resistance 3 is going to be included with any 3d display that was pre-ordered before

1934
02:25:28,340 --> 02:25:35,280
September 30th motor storm though will be included no matter what so that's why Walmart

1935
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:39,780
Amazon and GameStop were putting out all these deals I guess the whole time Sony was like

1936
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:44,780
yeah you can offer this deal and so it was to look like a pre-order I don't know is it

1937
02:25:44,780 --> 02:25:49,100
a brilliant marketing scheme or do you feel a little used or and who cares it's just a

1938
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:55,660
TV I don't think it's selling as well as they'd hoped really well come on it's a $499 piece

1939
02:25:55,660 --> 02:26:01,340
of yeah but it's 3d and it comes with two games it's 24 inch it's not that bad that's

1940
02:26:01,340 --> 02:26:05,500
perfect for like a dorm room I would love yes in college for a dorm room but then you

1941
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:11,620
gotta buy another pair of glasses if you wanna you know it it's expensive and there's a small

1942
02:26:11,620 --> 02:26:17,020
part of me that's interested but then I go but if I kick down like another $300 I could

1943
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:20,120
just get like a large 3d they're just trying to they're just trying to get you to buy now

1944
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:23,620
but then you wait wait just a little longer and you can get like you're gonna be able

1945
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:31,940
to get a you know full-size HDTV that supports 3d you know for less money and think of how

1946
02:26:31,940 --> 02:26:36,020
fast the technology is evolving I mean right now they have they're trying to sell us on

1947
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:39,820
these active shutter glasses which I've used them and they gave you a headache and they

1948
02:26:39,820 --> 02:26:44,940
don't have Sony TV too but just wait until they've come out with some technology where

1949
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:48,540
well they already have it out but you know where it becomes more mainstream where it's

1950
02:26:48,540 --> 02:26:55,060
either the non shutter glasses because each one of those is fucking $70 $70 for a pair

1951
02:26:55,060 --> 02:26:59,780
of glasses wow when you can you know I hope they got that the technology that they use

1952
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:06,540
for you know the Disney stuff or whatever and in theaters with those cheap ass $5 glasses

1953
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:12,660
you know that's what needs to become mainstream yeah so I can't steal a pair of glasses from

1954
02:27:12,660 --> 02:27:16,500
the theaters and use them on these TVs oh yeah cuz no they're active shutter no but

1955
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:23,220
it's not what the fucking like Sega Master System used that's what all the old 3d systems

1956
02:27:23,220 --> 02:27:30,720
used it was active shutter technology you know even way back to the Vectrex was active

1957
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:39,580
shutter you know the old school 3d stuff in IMAX was active shutter stuff but what they

1958
02:27:39,580 --> 02:27:44,900
need if they just you know really adopt that format with those cheaper glasses I think

1959
02:27:44,900 --> 02:27:48,900
that'd be the way to go because then it's not a big deal to get I think people will

1960
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:51,460
be more interested in that it's like okay I only have to drop money on this it's like

1961
02:27:51,460 --> 02:27:56,180
well if I want to watch 3d my family I've got to drop you know another I had to buy

1962
02:27:56,180 --> 02:28:04,100
another four pairs of glasses and there's another $300 hmm I don't know slices pop what

1963
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:09,900
do you think about these TVs do you think this is something I should get for the house

1964
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:14,340
knowing us we'll just save up and go to fries and get the real the real deal we don't need

1965
02:28:14,340 --> 02:28:17,900
the TV we don't need the starter kit I guess that's true that's kind of where I'm at with

1966
02:28:17,900 --> 02:28:23,680
this so all right for college kids I guess if you're in college did you need a 3d TV

1967
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:27,940
that will fit in a door I need a 3d TV in my dorm room amongst all the college expenses

1968
02:28:27,940 --> 02:28:32,300
well hey you know what my Super Nintendo and it wasn't that wasn't even the cutting edge

1969
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:37,060
thing Nintendo's the the kids upstairs had a Nintendo 64 and they were like the most

1970
02:28:37,060 --> 02:28:41,340
popular kids in the dorm but I was probably second popular with my Mario Kart nights in

1971
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:45,660
the dorm room yeah and Duke Nukem 3d I mean just wait I mean if they're putting out if

1972
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:51,900
Sony is able to put out a monitor for $499 and Sony I mean they're known for being pretty

1973
02:28:51,900 --> 02:28:57,220
high and as far as price points go on their products just wait there's gonna be they're

1974
02:28:57,220 --> 02:29:02,540
gonna be able to do that I just the right now people aren't putting out 3d TVs that

1975
02:29:02,540 --> 02:29:07,580
are 24 inches because who the fuck's gonna buy that I mean if you're gonna buy an HD

1976
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:11,620
TV and have a 3d it's gonna be something that's being you know used in your living room you're

1977
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:16,780
gonna want it to be pretty big so if there's a demand for it people put it out and they'll

1978
02:29:16,780 --> 02:29:21,460
put it out cheaper and it'll be better technology so just wait you don't need to jump in the

1979
02:29:21,460 --> 02:29:27,300
3d right away all right let's visit the mailbag and see what you guys think after all we are

1980
02:29:27,300 --> 02:29:31,340
the show where every gamer has a voice I'd like to share your voices not just through

1981
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:35,020
chat but through email and Twitter and so forth mailbag at orangelandtrader.com this

1982
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:40,420
place you can send us emails to get your longer thoughts out more than 140 characters and

1983
02:29:40,420 --> 02:29:44,340
salacious pop sitting in for trying to fill Jamie's shoes tonight it's gonna go ahead

1984
02:29:44,340 --> 02:29:52,220
and take over the mailbag okay our first email tonight is from Oscar and he writes I wasn't

1985
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:59,020
drunk Oscar I swear haha hi guys hugs I miss you all and it's been a while since I wrote

1986
02:29:59,020 --> 02:30:03,940
in so here goes first off as you saw on Twitter I was in Disney World for a week and just

1987
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:08,860
returned on Monday the 22nd I remember Rob mentioning something about electronica in

1988
02:30:08,860 --> 02:30:14,420
Disneyland and being the huge fan that I am of Tron legacy I was looking forward to seeing

1989
02:30:14,420 --> 02:30:19,180
something like that at Disney World it turns out that there was nothing Tron related there

1990
02:30:19,180 --> 02:30:23,660
other than some blu-ray discs of the movie on some store shelves what exactly did I miss

1991
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:29,540
out on Tron was on the monorail for a short time but nothing but a painting really Disney

1992
02:30:29,540 --> 02:30:34,260
World they didn't do anything for Tron there it's true also I've always wondered why there

1993
02:30:34,260 --> 02:30:39,980
isn't a Kingdom Hearts attraction at any of the parks probably because it's I'm wondering

1994
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:45,060
that too that's a brilliant question I it's like Disney refuses to acknowledge it maybe

1995
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:50,540
because it's a more square you probably have to share the characters money royalties with

1996
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:56,180
square well first off I think funny that he brought up electronica it makes me feel justified

1997
02:30:56,180 --> 02:30:59,540
for the 10-minute tangent in part a but I think we kind of covered it in part a so I

1998
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:02,660
don't think I need to elaborate further but as far as Kingdom Hearts I will tell you the

1999
02:31:02,660 --> 02:31:08,900
one thing one thing do two things I've ever seen Kingdom Hearts related in the park once

2000
02:31:08,900 --> 02:31:13,700
I was a store called off the page in California adventure and now I go there every time because

2001
02:31:13,700 --> 02:31:17,940
when I was there once I saw a Sora figurine and it was one of those like nice ceramic

2002
02:31:17,940 --> 02:31:21,620
figurines going for like a hundred bucks like it was that type of quality like a ceramic

2003
02:31:21,620 --> 02:31:26,060
doll and I really wish I bought it and I regret not buying it and that's the only thing

2004
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:31,020
Kingdom Hearts related I've ever seen in the park besides number two some parents drop

2005
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:35,420
brought their little kid once dressed to Sora and I saw them standing in line for the haunted

2006
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:38,500
mansion they were from Australia you know how sometimes little kids want to dress up

2007
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:41,700
and big kids can't dress up by the way they don't let you in Disneyland you have to be

2008
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:46,500
like seven or under if you want to wear a costume unless it's Halloween and you're at

2009
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:51,020
the Halloween party but we saw some Australian parents bring in their like six-year-old in

2010
02:31:51,020 --> 02:31:56,040
a Sora costume and it was adorable and even if you ask a Disney cast member that's working

2011
02:31:56,040 --> 02:32:03,060
at those memorabilia stores that are really into Disney lore they never really heard of

2012
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:07,420
Kingdom Hearts it's not on the radar for a lot of Disney employees it's a shame. Dark

2013
02:32:07,420 --> 02:32:12,780
Tetsuya says there was a Sora statue in interventions and that I wouldn't you know I don't go in

2014
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:17,700
interventions a lot I gotta be honest interventions kind of weak and they really need to convert

2015
02:32:17,700 --> 02:32:23,100
the building into something interesting but I wouldn't be surprised that they had a nod

2016
02:32:23,100 --> 02:32:26,460
to Sora in there as well especially because last time I was in there which is a couple

2017
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:31,840
years ago they had Xbox 360 units that were the exact same things that were on the E3

2018
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:39,140
show floor earlier that year so you know that's they get some use out of those year-round.

2019
02:32:39,140 --> 02:32:42,420
Does no one else think that a ride of some sort would be pretty awesome again this is

2020
02:32:42,420 --> 02:32:47,540
in regards to Kingdom Hearts or is it just something that Square Enix is holding back

2021
02:32:47,540 --> 02:32:53,460
on for when they launch their own amusement park smirk or sigh I guess my dream shall

2022
02:32:53,460 --> 02:33:00,020
suffice for now. I would assume Disney Sea in Tokyo has more but that's of course a huge

2023
02:33:00,020 --> 02:33:03,460
assumption and I don't really know I would have to rely on a Japanese listener who maybe

2024
02:33:03,460 --> 02:33:07,460
has been there to tell me if Kingdom Hearts has more of a presence there I'm assuming

2025
02:33:07,460 --> 02:33:11,900
but I could be wrong. Secondly while I do think that sending bees to Nintendo would

2026
02:33:11,900 --> 02:33:17,520
be pretty amusing I cannot do so due to me being absolutely terrified of them maybe Operation

2027
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:22,460
Rainfall members can send bottles of their tears instead. I like that. Was it a campaign

2028
02:33:22,460 --> 02:33:27,260
to send bees to Nintendo? It was on the show a couple weeks ago. And I'm going to end this

2029
02:33:27,260 --> 02:33:32,420
email with one last question regarding 3DS colors. You guys mentioned that the flare

2030
02:33:32,420 --> 02:33:37,300
red 3DS would be coming out in the US in early September. The thing is I'm holding out for

2031
02:33:37,300 --> 02:33:42,220
the release of the purple 3DS that was shown on the floor at E3. That thing looked freaking

2032
02:33:42,220 --> 02:33:48,860
beautiful and he included a link to it and it does it's a gorgeous sexy it's very Prince

2033
02:33:48,860 --> 02:33:55,180
Joker shade of deep purple like yeah it's like the cool purple it's a metallic purple

2034
02:33:55,180 --> 02:34:00,180
not like the like girl it's not let's not lavender it is that's a kid at Chris color

2035
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:05,340
if I ever saw one I and I didn't you know and I was at E3 that year to have an eggplant

2036
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:12,020
purple right there eggplant wizard yeah like that I I wish I remembered seeing that because

2037
02:34:12,020 --> 02:34:18,340
that is a sexy 3DS well I may consider getting the flare red system is there any word on

2038
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:21,940
more colors coming out in the near future no they've announced anything other than the

2039
02:34:21,940 --> 02:34:26,100
flare red one and they're not going to I just wait for them wait their announcement yeah

2040
02:34:26,100 --> 02:34:30,500
wait for that Tokyo event because that could be but that's you know that's probably gonna

2041
02:34:30,500 --> 02:34:38,100
be more Japan but you never know I would still say hold out until after the Tokyo event which

2042
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:44,500
won't be that long after the flare red DS is out anyway 3DS is out anyway besides you

2043
02:34:44,500 --> 02:34:49,620
probably want to hold out anyways until you know more games come out because they could

2044
02:34:49,620 --> 02:34:53,460
and I hope they don't do it but they could very well even though they've been saying

2045
02:34:53,460 --> 02:34:58,500
Mario Mario 3d land and Mario Kart and be out this year they could very well go up that's

2046
02:34:58,500 --> 02:35:03,980
next year now you watch it could it could well they haven't said anything yet makes

2047
02:35:03,980 --> 02:35:11,460
me wonder thank you as always for reading Oscar so that's the first email next we have

2048
02:35:11,460 --> 02:35:16,540
and I I really don't want to be rude to this person this was written in by Holly Holly

2049
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:23,700
D the first or the two-thirds of the email is basically just a verbatim talking about

2050
02:35:23,700 --> 02:35:30,100
the Deus Ex GameStop removing the code controversy so the first 30 minutes of this show sure

2051
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:34,900
is really for you Holly sure I'm not going to read it just because it's it's literally

2052
02:35:34,900 --> 02:35:41,060
just saying what happened and how there was a leaked memo and blah blah blah so the commentary

2053
02:35:41,060 --> 02:35:46,680
seriously I've been off GameStop for a while but I still went in and look now and then

2054
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:51,020
and I still considered buying things from there but coupled with what sky has been saying

2055
02:35:51,020 --> 02:35:56,900
lately in this referring to the code scandal with Deus Ex well this is the final straw

2056
02:35:56,900 --> 02:36:06,180
no more now now it's power gamer Best Buy or online retailers GameStop can stop it yeah

2057
02:36:06,180 --> 02:36:10,500
I mean we kind of talked to death about it the first 30 minutes of the show but I think

2058
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:15,660
what Holly saying in her email echoes what quite a few people are thinking this week

2059
02:36:15,660 --> 02:36:21,140
it will be interesting I would like to go back and ask these people in a year did you

2060
02:36:21,140 --> 02:36:27,420
stick with it I would ask myself that near to did I stick with it or did I break down

2061
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:31,340
because GameStop had some stupid exclusive that I had to have I'm trying to think get

2062
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:36,500
a Skyrim exclusive I'm gonna be so goddamn I don't remember the last time I ever I was

2063
02:36:36,500 --> 02:36:42,580
in a GameStop me neither for anything I think I remember the last game I look when we go

2064
02:36:42,580 --> 02:36:46,780
in the mall I'm not gonna you know I we've gone in the mall and looked but it's more

2065
02:36:46,780 --> 02:36:50,740
of a well what's what's new what's I forget what games are out you know even though I

2066
02:36:50,740 --> 02:36:54,820
do this show sometimes I forget I think the last time I was in there well one times I

2067
02:36:54,820 --> 02:37:02,860
remember was when I was picking up extra copies of episodes from Liberty City just to stock

2068
02:37:02,860 --> 02:37:08,340
the other machines we have but I don't think I don't think I bought a new game from them

2069
02:37:08,340 --> 02:37:15,860
for a long time I don't remember the last thing I bought at one do you I don't remember

2070
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:20,860
usually when we go in it's to see what they what obscure thing that they have for 360

2071
02:37:20,860 --> 02:37:24,340
or ps3 that's used at a decent price and usually oh that's price too high for a used game and

2072
02:37:24,340 --> 02:37:28,740
we leave mm-hmm I still have a gift card there it's like that same story every time isn't

2073
02:37:28,740 --> 02:37:34,180
it I like their magazine and sometimes we're just fucking bored and you want to go window

2074
02:37:34,180 --> 02:37:38,460
shop you know like even though everything I said about the place is just kind of whatever

2075
02:37:38,460 --> 02:37:42,340
it's here let's just go in and look I'm not gonna buy anything but I'll look and sometimes

2076
02:37:42,340 --> 02:37:47,020
you know and then this goes for a lot of places they may have good deals on like rock band

2077
02:37:47,020 --> 02:37:51,700
equipment or something like that if you need some of that I mean because it's so dirt cheap

2078
02:37:51,700 --> 02:38:02,100
nowadays okay and our final email is from Chiggers this is sent through our comment

2079
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:08,180
system on the site reading an article recently on IGN entitled what games have taught me

2080
02:38:08,180 --> 02:38:13,580
and it got me thinking about historical facts in games as a way of teaching kids they referred

2081
02:38:13,580 --> 02:38:18,860
to one nest game at North and South which I which I have as an example can you think

2082
02:38:18,860 --> 02:38:23,700
of any other more recent games that have historical facts and whether or not you think it would

2083
02:38:23,700 --> 02:38:28,260
be used more in today's games as a teaching tool I can think of like God a war would be

2084
02:38:28,260 --> 02:38:35,260
good for like mythology I mean well you know it makes a stretch but okay no I won't be

2085
02:38:35,260 --> 02:38:41,540
right we're aware of like you know what different gods were Titans were the pantheon is accurate

2086
02:38:41,540 --> 02:38:46,540
Athena Aries that's all all the edutainment games that I think of that I learned shit

2087
02:38:46,540 --> 02:38:51,120
from is obviously very old and dated I think of Oregon Trail Carmen San Diego number munchers

2088
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:55,780
absolutely Carmen San Diego math blasters but all that shit's old but at the same time

2089
02:38:55,780 --> 02:39:01,260
actually a lot of that shit is still around like I believe math blasters still exist in

2090
02:39:01,260 --> 02:39:06,720
some form I want to say Oregon trails been working trails been remade now it's a Facebook

2091
02:39:06,720 --> 02:39:12,000
game and kids have that on 3ds right now this year yeah so a lot of those games actually

2092
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:16,240
still exist like they've been updating them forget we just don't follow them because we're

2093
02:39:16,240 --> 02:39:23,060
not six or seven anymore except the occasional retro cool oh lol Oregon Trail on Facebook

2094
02:39:23,060 --> 02:39:27,680
ha ha ha I made slashes pop die of dysentery right like that's that's about the extent

2095
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:31,520
of it but who really sits down to play an edutainment game I don't think I learned anything

2096
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:37,980
from Oregon Trail you learned that if you killed 4,000 pounds of Buffalo you can only

2097
02:39:37,980 --> 02:39:44,020
take 10 pounds of it back I learned that that was fun yes you learned where what where where

2098
02:39:44,020 --> 02:39:50,540
did where does the Oregon Trail start yeah independence Missouri and that's why I remember

2099
02:39:50,540 --> 02:39:55,260
that from the game see I learned nothing from the Oregon Trail of course I hope I got that

2100
02:39:55,260 --> 02:39:58,380
right or I'm gonna sound hella stupid I guess I didn't learn anything for the Oregon Trail

2101
02:39:58,380 --> 02:40:05,460
whatsoever it starts in Florida no I'm not I need to click on this IGN article and see

2102
02:40:05,460 --> 02:40:09,380
what what's actually being quoted here but I'll come on you know there's nothing valuable

2103
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:18,800
there for those that played Bioshock the first one the whole story of rapture the under under

2104
02:40:18,800 --> 02:40:25,220
the sea city was based off of and Rand the fountainhead Atlas shrugged the objectivism

2105
02:40:25,220 --> 02:40:30,460
approach to politics which is some pretty highbrow adult concepts you wouldn't really

2106
02:40:30,460 --> 02:40:36,100
know who and Rand is from playing that game but the antagonist was Andrew Ryan obviously

2107
02:40:36,100 --> 02:40:43,180
a play on her name so that was a game developer saying let's take this whole you know way

2108
02:40:43,180 --> 02:40:47,340
of thinking that a lot of adults you apply to their politics and make a video game based

2109
02:40:47,340 --> 02:40:52,540
on based on it I don't know that that was kind of an intellectual angle for a game did

2110
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:56,900
you play Bioshock did you pick up on any of that I played a little bit of it but I more

2111
02:40:56,900 --> 02:41:01,460
picked up because I didn't get to that killer twist ending that everybody talks about because

2112
02:41:01,460 --> 02:41:05,700
I'm terrible at first-person shooters I was more like wow this game is really good-looking

2113
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:10,580
great game yeah I know I know well here's the thing now that you just told me that if

2114
02:41:10,580 --> 02:41:14,520
I wait for Bioshock infinite on PlayStation 3 I can get the first game for free yeah that's

2115
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:21,420
like in a year it's over a year from now dude just seriously is played is there a skill

2116
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:25,620
level where like any dope can get through yeah you can play it on easy okay yeah and

2117
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:29,980
is it like you pray where you never die that's the only reason I could play okay you die

2118
02:41:29,980 --> 02:41:34,700
fucking die but there's respawn points and it's not like you're dead forever I mean all

2119
02:41:34,700 --> 02:41:40,140
right I could do that yeah and steam has had like Bioshock what to on sale for eight bucks

2120
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:44,540
you get one free two I wasn't a big fan of although I should really go back and play

2121
02:41:44,540 --> 02:41:51,380
it but one was great it was a great game that's why I'm so for infinite looks it looks great

2122
02:41:51,380 --> 02:41:57,660
I just can't wait to play it didn't the romancing the throne games talk about like the empires

2123
02:41:57,660 --> 02:42:03,780
of China and Mongolia and all that those words that historical yes but a great comment from

2124
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:06,980
somebody who just joined our chat room but didn't change their nickname so it's just

2125
02:42:06,980 --> 02:42:13,500
anonymous person in chat says the civilization series excellent point the Civ series are

2126
02:42:13,500 --> 02:42:20,220
amazing Dan just handed me a copy of Bioshock on the PlayStation 3 from the vault and gave

2127
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:26,540
me that here take it look so I guess I'm playing Bioshock it's all right I'll fucking keep

2128
02:42:26,540 --> 02:42:32,060

2129
02:42:32,060 --> 02:42:47,780
I think she had my copy of clue for like two years they can't hear you they can't hear

2130
02:42:47,780 --> 02:42:52,460
you Dan all right moving on yeah so that's it for the mailbag all right thanks thanks

2131
02:42:52,460 --> 02:42:57,020
for writing in thanks for reading tonight mailbag at orange lounge radio.com if you

2132
02:42:57,020 --> 02:42:59,940
want to do that in the future I like that I can't believe I didn't think of that answer

2133
02:42:59,940 --> 02:43:03,820
I just talked about that my freaking week civilization games absolutely you learn about

2134
02:43:03,820 --> 02:43:08,060
some of the great leaders and you know sometimes there sometimes the units that they get that

2135
02:43:08,060 --> 02:43:13,580
are special talk about their culture or kind of something to that culture you know you're

2136
02:43:13,580 --> 02:43:17,900
not going to learn detailed facts but sometimes you're playing scenarios and things like that

2137
02:43:17,900 --> 02:43:22,460
and maybe even that's a great answer maybe some of the World War II like Call of Duty

2138
02:43:22,460 --> 02:43:26,460
games or a battlefield games from you may learn a little bit about history and stuff

2139
02:43:26,460 --> 02:43:36,060
there hmm all right moving on let's talk about the F use of the week oh every week here on

2140
02:43:36,060 --> 02:43:41,340
the program we get angsty why because we can we have a microphone and your attention so

2141
02:43:41,340 --> 02:44:02,380
we're going to rant that's what people do Loki wants to start us off tonight fuck you

2142
02:44:02,380 --> 02:44:07,320
to the mark system for those who are unaware of what the mark system is think of it like

2143
02:44:07,320 --> 02:44:12,860
an enhanced version of the Dewey decimal system or like a bibliography for everything in the

2144
02:44:12,860 --> 02:44:19,860
goddamn world I fucking have to learn that shit this week and it was boring as hell it's

2145
02:44:19,860 --> 02:44:26,160
like libraries are so fucking old school get with the times they have to like it's ridiculous

2146
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:31,260
all the crap that they break down about each individual thing and mainly I was looking

2147
02:44:31,260 --> 02:44:36,440
for DVDs and games but oh my god is boring and I had to learn the Dewey decimal system

2148
02:44:36,440 --> 02:44:39,580
for a little bit which actually Dewey decimal system isn't as complicated as I thought which

2149
02:44:39,580 --> 02:44:45,100
is great but I still don't care so fuck you though slashes pop do you have any F use the

2150
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:53,140
week this might be taking from your F use but F you to giant huge spiders that like

2151
02:44:53,140 --> 02:44:58,660
to make webs above our front door so we have to not walk into them he's big I don't want

2152
02:44:58,660 --> 02:45:04,740
to I need to spray acid on him or the pesticide the raid he's a bits of big spider you need

2153
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:09,420
to open the door spray it and close it real fast no I'm gonna do it from the patio oh

2154
02:45:09,420 --> 02:45:14,100
that's a good idea stun him with Windex follow up with Buck spray afterwards so I did that

2155
02:45:14,100 --> 02:45:19,180
with the fly it it basically knocked the fly out of the air he couldn't fly anymore got

2156
02:45:19,180 --> 02:45:23,060
him with a ray turned upside down who knew what we were gonna learn bug killing trips

2157
02:45:23,060 --> 02:45:27,700
on tonight tips on tonight's orange launch radio yeah he hides up in the corner in the

2158
02:45:27,700 --> 02:45:31,260
day then he just parks in the middle of his huge ass web at night and he's like you walk

2159
02:45:31,260 --> 02:45:36,340
into us I believe your face it's a big fucking spider people it is a bit like I if the spider

2160
02:45:36,340 --> 02:45:44,580

2163
02:45:57,220 --> 02:46:01,860
said oh yeah the cats didn't you know shit and pee everywhere and we turned on our PCs

2164
02:46:01,860 --> 02:46:06,340
in the bed and we look at our our headsets that we use for ventrilo on World of Warcraft

2171
02:46:38,740 --> 02:46:43,460

2172
02:46:43,460 --> 02:46:49,080
they just ate ate our headsets for fun ass asshole cap just to just teach us a lesson

2173
02:46:49,080 --> 02:46:52,680
yeah and then we're by the way we're leaving again at the end of the month yeah for another

2174
02:46:52,680 --> 02:46:57,060
four or five days I saw you shut the door to the office last night I saw oh I did yeah

2175
02:46:57,060 --> 02:46:59,820
were you afraid of that happened I thought maybe you were afraid of that happening overnight

2176
02:46:59,820 --> 02:47:05,580
I left I left my computer on my computer's loud okay I'm see I'm seeding torrents who

2177
02:47:05,580 --> 02:47:12,820
what porn did you get all right moving on going on to my F use funny enough not the

2178
02:47:12,820 --> 02:47:18,860
F use I was thinking of the F you I'm thinking of tonight F you to the fact that this morning

2179
02:47:18,860 --> 02:47:25,620
I was supposed to get up at 9 a.m. but I set my alarm on a weekday alarm on my iPhone the

2180
02:47:25,620 --> 02:47:29,060
same one as my work alarm you know something's just changed the time on the alarm I'm not

2181
02:47:29,060 --> 02:47:32,580
thinking it yeah I was only set for weekdays you're supposed to meet some people for brunch

2182
02:47:32,580 --> 02:47:37,060
at 10 30 we go to gay brunch every Sunday I try to I get a text message at 10 20 we

2183
02:47:37,060 --> 02:47:42,900
have a table it's in the back but the text message woke me up to a off fuck like this

2184
02:47:42,900 --> 02:47:48,340
I think that's what you heard this morning right that's what you woke up to yeah oops

2185
02:47:48,340 --> 02:47:52,940
so if you to myself so yeah we had to flake and say that we are lazy slugs and we we slept

2186
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:58,180
and I missed brunch the sound of gay man judgment coming through the phone you could just you

2187
02:47:58,180 --> 02:48:08,100
could just feel it you know you know what I'm talking about all right now moving on

2188
02:48:08,100 --> 02:48:13,780
more news stories and then the Twitter and skype line coming up at 1 877 game olr toll-free

2189
02:48:13,780 --> 02:48:24,500
numbers back this week hooray so there's been a new break in the console hacking scene if

2190
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:31,220
you will apparently there is now a new exploit called the reset glitch hack that allows any

2191
02:48:31,220 --> 02:48:41,220
Xbox 360 any from now before and in the future to be turned into a JTAG console period apparently

2192
02:48:41,220 --> 02:48:48,220
it is an exploit that cannot be patched and people have already found a way to that sounds

2193
02:48:48,220 --> 02:48:53,780
pretty definitive they've run away or found a way to load this program called Zell which

2194
02:48:53,780 --> 02:48:59,220
is kind of like a front end for they don't have any read was like rebooters yet which

2195
02:48:59,220 --> 02:49:04,140
means you can't run a custom firmware on it yet but right now you can launch homebrew

2196
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:09,460
stuff and they have a video someone actually running a Nintendo 64 emulator on their slim

2197
02:49:09,460 --> 02:49:16,780
and already different people out there and you know the mod scene of already created

2198
02:49:16,780 --> 02:49:22,020
new tools to enable people to do that so it's a matter of time before the JTAG prices drop

2199
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:31,020
and people will be able to do more crazy homebrew stuff or piracy I guess you know a lot of

2200
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:35,700
people are using for piracy well at least right now there's no way to take JTAGs online

2201
02:49:35,700 --> 02:49:41,740
without them being banned immediately once people figure a way around that then yeah

2202
02:49:41,740 --> 02:49:52,220
so it's interesting you have a JTAG so it doesn't matter I don't know I'm just I don't

2203
02:49:52,220 --> 02:49:56,660
know like it's it's I talked about this on the last show which is two weeks ago about

2204
02:49:56,660 --> 02:50:00,820
when I talked about how I finally did the Wii because joystick put the instructions

2205
02:50:00,820 --> 02:50:04,260
up that made it look so easy and it's kind of like you know I have to really have a reason

2206
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:07,940
to do it and now my reason for at least the Wii is being able to play shit that Nintendo

2207
02:50:07,940 --> 02:50:13,180
won't release in this country it's kind of nice so I don't know I don't have a reason

2208
02:50:13,180 --> 02:50:21,060
yet to do that to my 360 but well my 360 I use a lot for editing Grand Theft Auto so

2209
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:25,380
I use it to test stuff instead of having the burn discs every time it's back in the day

2210
02:50:25,380 --> 02:50:29,940
when I first started doing Grand Theft Auto mods I did have the burn discs every time

2211
02:50:29,940 --> 02:50:35,620
and I had a stack of discs that were just ridiculous so it does save me a lot of money

2212
02:50:35,620 --> 02:50:40,660
in that sense plus you can do mods and trainers and stuff like that on games and it's kind

2213
02:50:40,660 --> 02:50:47,000
of fun alright moving on to a game series that I'm sure a lot of people are very excited

2214
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:50,300
about this is going to be a system seller I'm not even kidding for the PlayStation Vita

2215
02:50:50,300 --> 02:50:57,500
a lot of people are going to be excited about this Persona 4 Persona 4 now this was already

2216
02:50:57,500 --> 02:51:02,260
a PlayStation 2 game but they are going to be actually making a portable port of this

2217
02:51:02,260 --> 02:51:07,140
it's going to be out in Japan in 2012 they're going to be enhancing some things new animation

2218
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:11,940
one new character new voice acting wireless support where you can call others if you think

2219
02:51:11,940 --> 02:51:16,460
you're about to die in a dungeon and so forth crazy also announced however which is very

2220
02:51:16,460 --> 02:51:23,060
interesting a Persona fighting game it's by Arc System Works you know them Blazblue right

2221
02:51:23,060 --> 02:51:28,660
it's Persona 4 the ultimate in my account my Onaka arena it's going to hit arcades in

2222
02:51:28,660 --> 02:51:33,140
spring of 2012 apparently PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions will come out later in the

2223
02:51:33,140 --> 02:51:40,180
summer so persona fans have a lot to be excited about so yeah I have persona 3 the hella edition

2224
02:51:40,180 --> 02:51:45,060
that came out for the ps2 because it came out twice persona 3 in the second edition

2225
02:51:45,060 --> 02:51:48,660
and then I hear that the PSP port of persona 3 that came out a year or two ago is even

2226
02:51:48,660 --> 02:51:51,900
better than that and aren't those games like I haven't gotten really into a lot of persona

2227
02:51:51,900 --> 02:51:55,660
games aren't they very big on like it's it's kind of like a do whatever you want type of

2228
02:51:55,660 --> 02:52:00,920
RPG isn't it some are a lot of them run on a like a calendar system where you do you

2229
02:52:00,920 --> 02:52:06,240
have a certain amount of time in a day to do something but persona 4 address some pretty

2230
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:12,060
adult concepts that aren't really that controversial but they are because video games are for kids

2231
02:52:12,060 --> 02:52:17,660
of course that they handled very maturely and I'm glad that that content is there but

2232
02:52:17,660 --> 02:52:21,480
yeah and I have persona 4 for the ps2 I didn't know that collector's edition yet said it's

2233
02:52:21,480 --> 02:52:25,320
on our shelf never touched it now this edition for the vitamin is what may as well wait for

2234
02:52:25,320 --> 02:52:28,500
the new one it's got more shit in it the adult content he's talking about is dick pics of

2235
02:52:28,500 --> 02:52:34,340
course drawn in the instruction manual of course of course tastefully tastefully all

2236
02:52:34,340 --> 02:52:40,220
right anyhow so let's just pop why don't you give us another news story this was pretty

2237
02:52:40,220 --> 02:52:48,620
huge on the internet last week maybe a week before basically a fan YouTube or a flash

2238
02:52:48,620 --> 02:52:56,500
animation of Super Mario Brothers with portal gun because of portal to portal gun is awesome

2239
02:52:56,500 --> 02:53:01,700
everyone watched it on Newgrounds or YouTube and everyone laughed and it was great well

2240
02:53:01,700 --> 02:53:05,660
a student let me play a little clip here in the background so you can hear the noises

2241
02:53:05,660 --> 02:53:14,820
a studio it's a two-man team that calls themselves stab yourself so stab yourself studios oh

2242
02:53:14,820 --> 02:53:18,980
what a pleasant name they are make that's like one of the old-school Nintendo emulators

2243
02:53:18,980 --> 02:53:26,020
remember Nestle and Genesis yeah charming names they are making Mario Super Mario Brothers

2244
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:31,480
with a portal gun for real they are working on it hopefully valve and I won't shut it

2245
02:53:31,480 --> 02:53:37,380
down but um they have a proof of concept so valve will just hire him yeah okay yeah absolutely

2246
02:53:37,380 --> 02:53:42,800
valve will just hire him to make a Mario clone that has the portal guns in it watch that's

2247
02:53:42,800 --> 02:53:47,060
how valve responds to things and they have sort of an alpha proof of concept YouTube

2248
02:53:47,060 --> 02:53:52,060
up and you can see what the game plays like and it looks pretty awesome it's nice it's

2249
02:53:52,060 --> 02:53:59,480
cool of course is it gonna be one of those games you play for five minutes and you're

2250
02:53:59,480 --> 02:54:05,500
like well I know on Newgrounds there was the big um I'm it's Super Mario Brothers but you

2251
02:54:05,500 --> 02:54:09,780
can play it as Samus and Kid Icarus and one of the contra dudes Super Mario crossover

2252
02:54:09,780 --> 02:54:13,740
it reminds me of that yeah it does a little bit but yeah they're saying that they're working

2253
02:54:13,740 --> 02:54:17,300
on it and they've got a YouTube channel up for progress but who knows if this will ever

02:54:17,300 --> 02:54:24,900
see the light of day or it's gonna go shut it down we'll see yeah all right just a couple

2255
02:54:24,900 --> 02:54:28,220
more news stories for you guys before we get to calls there should really get Gordon Ramsay

2256
02:54:28,220 --> 02:54:35,380
to do the announcements for when they're gonna shut it down you're thinking Hell's Kitchen

2257
02:54:35,380 --> 02:54:40,060
right yeah Gordon Ramsay yeah oh yeah no I've seen that show it's like that show has been

2258
02:54:40,060 --> 02:54:45,900
on how long it is terrible and it's on season eight or nine so particular every challenge

2259
02:54:45,900 --> 02:54:49,780
ends with a tie I know this isn't I do video games but I gotta say like what wait what

2260
02:54:49,780 --> 02:54:54,740
what shows this Hell's Kitchen it's been the same fucking show for nine years like it really

2261
02:54:54,740 --> 02:55:00,020
has like at least something like Survivor or Big Brother has the different people they

2262
02:55:00,020 --> 02:55:04,020
get into the different conflicts there's different twists and so forth but in Hell's Kitchen

2263
02:55:04,020 --> 02:55:09,740
the twists don't even matter like you I I just turned it on randomly one day I had no

2264
02:55:09,740 --> 02:55:15,580
idea who the fuck any of the people were what season it even was but I was just like lol

2267
02:55:25,420 --> 02:55:31,960

02:55:31,960 --> 02:55:36,580
San Francisco called Culinary Academy he's trying to get on that show okay so he's trying

2270
02:55:40,820 --> 02:55:43,580
show that's right people tell me I should be on Big Brother and I'm like I'm not cute

2271
02:55:43,580 --> 02:55:47,380
enough for Big Brother but then they point out well you know Adam's on there here's a

2272
02:55:47,380 --> 02:55:51,660
tip for anybody that's going on Hell's Kitchen that menu is always the same learn how to

2273
02:55:51,660 --> 02:55:56,660
cook the things on the goddamn menu and you'll be fine that's it it's always the same there's

2274
02:55:56,660 --> 02:56:01,020
always a fucking risotto there's always a fucking like chicken there's always a fish

2275
02:56:01,020 --> 02:56:06,140
entree it's always the same goddamn thing just learn how to cook that you're done you're

2276
02:56:06,140 --> 02:56:10,980
set you're gonna have your own fucking restaurant and don't talk back I think you need to go

2277
02:56:10,980 --> 02:56:16,020
on Hell's Kitchen I don't know how to cook although if I did I would learn how to cook

2278
02:56:16,020 --> 02:56:20,100
the risotto and cook all that shit and they way he's like he's all this is what risotto

2279
02:56:20,100 --> 02:56:23,020
supposed to taste like that's right bitch that's right you should have done it this

2280
02:56:23,020 --> 02:56:29,060
way and you just don't call me if you fucking call me a bitch no I wouldn't talk to him

2281
02:56:29,060 --> 02:56:33,740
though I'd talk to the other people that when you piss them off I love the stunt cake shows

2282
02:56:33,740 --> 02:56:38,980
where they have to make this huge SpongeBob SquarePants with like a fucking Ferris wheel

2283
02:56:38,980 --> 02:56:44,500
and like a waterfall you know Food Network challenge or whatever it's always it's always

2284
02:56:44,500 --> 02:56:48,580
a cake once they replace the host and host is terrible and it's it's always awesome when

2285
02:56:48,580 --> 02:56:52,100
because they have to carry it from the kitchen to the judgment table sometimes the whole

2286
02:56:52,100 --> 02:56:56,620
thing was fucking fall over there's $300 a cake on the floor there are two Food Network

2287
02:56:56,620 --> 02:56:59,820
shows I can actually watch one of them is the old-school Iron Chef from Japan which

2288
02:56:59,820 --> 02:57:05,180
I don't even think they show anymore on food TV or it's a the cooking channel now and then

2289
02:57:05,180 --> 02:57:10,060
I watch I can watch Unwrapped with Mark Summers because Mark Summers I was really in a Top

2290
02:57:10,060 --> 02:57:17,660
Chef until I got to replace of it replays are no new shows oh that's a bummer easy thing

2291
02:57:17,660 --> 02:57:24,120
yeah I watched a ton of Food Network a ton of food when I lived with him Nelly would

2292
02:57:24,120 --> 02:57:27,780
come over and they would watch Food Network like that's how I got to watching some of

2293
02:57:27,780 --> 02:57:31,060
these shows because I just be kind of sitting there I go I fucking food looks so fucking

2294
02:57:31,060 --> 02:57:36,740
good oh my god oh my god this shows about oh my god it's an unwrapped on Pringles died

2295
02:57:36,740 --> 02:57:40,940
what to have and watch a lot of Food Network and it's great it's I like watching Chopped

2296
02:57:40,940 --> 02:57:45,140
because it's like a mini Iron Chef it's actually pretty good I like it's pretty cool hosted

2297
02:57:45,140 --> 02:57:50,240
by Ted Allen from your Queer Eye I really wish that shows on TV I love that show it's

2298
02:57:50,240 --> 02:57:58,480
sad it's gone I do I understand so my guilty pleasure shows are makeover shows I love makeover

2299
02:57:58,480 --> 02:58:03,780
shows you know it's not necessarily people makeover Loki is the straight one on the show

2300
02:58:03,780 --> 02:58:10,580
you know not necessarily people makeover shows it's like you know like the car makeover shows

2301
02:58:10,580 --> 02:58:15,180
you know like there's my ride there's a home there's a house makeover show I don't watch

2302
02:58:15,180 --> 02:58:20,140
that but but like they have a restaurant impossible now it's a restaurant makeover show do you

2303
02:58:20,140 --> 02:58:26,460
watch Extreme Makeover no did you watch The Swan no no I don't I don't watch the people

2304
02:58:26,460 --> 02:58:32,220
makeover so I like I like them like building stuff you know like I used to watch Junkyard

2305
02:58:32,220 --> 02:58:36,700
Wars and stuff like that you know stuff where they're taking a pit my rides kind of dumb

2306
02:58:36,700 --> 02:58:41,820
I mean they're like 50 TVs in there it doesn't make any sense but like I like watching them

2307
02:58:41,820 --> 02:58:47,900
you know do stuff to cars and like you remake them and stuff like I used to watch the the

2308
02:58:47,900 --> 02:58:51,980
Jesse James one or whatever monster garage and stuff like that you know those shows are

2309
02:58:51,980 --> 02:58:58,340
awesome yeah and Queer Eye was a good show I liked that show it was it was good you know

2310
02:58:58,340 --> 02:59:02,260
because the people that were on the show like the five guys that they had there were great

2311
02:59:02,260 --> 02:59:05,900
and now they have all their own stuff and Ted Allen's awesome he's one of the best people

2312
02:59:05,900 --> 02:59:11,840
on the show the Blondes on Dancing with the Stars Carson the blonde who was in charge

2313
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:17,140
of clothes I think he's yeah he's on Dancing with the Stars and people it's so funny because

2314
02:59:17,140 --> 02:59:20,660
people are not even talking about like when Lance Bass a gay guy was on Dancing with the

2315
02:59:20,660 --> 02:59:24,020
Stars you know middle America was all oh my god I can't believe why don't they partner

2316
02:59:24,020 --> 02:59:27,580
you with another man it's so gross it's a family show like people aren't even fucking

2317
02:59:27,580 --> 02:59:31,560
talking about Carson because they totally upped the ante by putting a transgender person

2318
02:59:31,560 --> 02:59:36,140
on this year with Chaz Bono it's like no one no one cur that you're gay because we got

2319
02:59:36,140 --> 02:59:41,860
a transgender and they're oh my god it's ruining Americana and all this bullshit like just

2320
02:59:41,860 --> 02:59:47,120
how are we talking about before I don't remember now I don't know but my point is if Chaz

2321
02:59:47,120 --> 02:59:55,700
Bono wants to dance god damn it let him dance shut the fuck up just because you can't dance

2322
02:59:55,700 --> 02:59:58,620
and they'll have Gordon Ramsay come out and yell at him yes and that'll be that'll bring

2323
02:59:58,620 --> 03:00:02,860
it back to the top story there you go but I do I do hope Asa Case comes back this fall

2324
03:00:02,860 --> 03:00:06,820
because I miss that show the way it ties into video games is there's a fucking DS game for

2325
03:00:06,820 --> 03:00:12,740
every one of these goddamn shows we just mentioned Iron Chef and it was terrible yes I played

2326
03:00:12,740 --> 03:00:16,980
that at PAX one year it was it was better than Cooking Mama yeah but it ended up being

2327
03:00:16,980 --> 03:00:24,020
terrible all right can we move on low key with the gaming news story we can move on

2328
03:00:24,020 --> 03:00:28,580
EA is trying to downplay the whole origin exclusivity of their their titles they're

2329
03:00:28,580 --> 03:00:33,900
basically saying competition and choice go hand in hand so the fact that we only distribute

2330
03:00:33,900 --> 03:00:41,280
our own games on our own platform I don't see that he explained that basically the company

2331
03:00:41,280 --> 03:00:45,780
is in discussions with other publishers that have their games on origin but EA's key focus

2332
03:00:45,780 --> 03:00:51,340
is to develop an oppressive consumer experience where people are happy to play and buy game

2333
03:00:51,340 --> 03:00:55,420
you're just fucking competing with valve okay just stop dancing around it you're trying

2334
03:00:55,420 --> 03:00:59,660
to compete with valve and it's just an awkward situation because you publish valve games

2335
03:00:59,660 --> 03:01:07,460
as well so whatever so battlefield 3 won't be on there oh big big deal you know what

2336
03:01:07,460 --> 03:01:15,740
I don't care you know I heard a story later in the week though about I guess valve games

2337
03:01:15,740 --> 03:01:22,220
are now showing up on origin yeah the PC ones like the actual physical games that EA published

2338
03:01:22,220 --> 03:01:33,700
are showing up on their site but not any digital stuff all right one more story for you guys

2339
03:01:33,700 --> 03:01:38,700
Square Enix is going to be expanding and they're expanding Eidos Montreal they're going to

2340
03:01:38,700 --> 03:01:44,020
be adding 350 employees over the next few years up to 2015 of course they're not saying

2341
03:01:44,020 --> 03:01:48,740
exactly what it is they're developing they haven't really officially announced this either

2342
03:01:48,740 --> 03:01:54,260
but there's a report that's out there from la press affair it's a French name la press

2343
03:01:54,260 --> 03:01:59,700
a a fairies I don't know le press affair that talks about how they're going to double in

2344
03:01:59,700 --> 03:02:03,860
size and accommodate these employees their report says that a tentative agreement was

2345
03:02:03,860 --> 03:02:11,260
made between Eidos Square Enix and all that and investment Quebec that will give them

2346
03:02:11,260 --> 03:02:16,580
tax credits and a 2 million subsidy to square and you know I think this is important to

2347
03:02:16,580 --> 03:02:22,080
point out because with all these news of game studios closing and going under it's nice

2348
03:02:22,080 --> 03:02:28,700
to hear about some expanding isn't it Montreal Eidos I believe is making the fourth thief

2349
03:02:28,700 --> 03:02:33,620
game remember the thief series that's one of the big games they're working on so that's

2350
03:02:33,620 --> 03:02:39,740
pretty cool and of course I'm sure their secret products and all that good stuff so all right

2351

2361
03:03:48,380 --> 03:03:54,340

2362
03:03:54,340 --> 03:04:00,620
talk to us about tonight well first off I'm still really mad about electronica not going

2363
03:04:00,620 --> 03:04:05,300
to be you know up and running when I go to Anaheim in a couple weeks I told well what

2364
03:04:05,300 --> 03:04:10,420
about Oscar what about what about Oscar who emailed us saying that he went to Disney World

2365
03:04:10,420 --> 03:04:14,580
expecting to see a version of it there and he got the shaft he got Tron on blu-ray that's

2366
03:04:14,580 --> 03:04:22,020
what he got well you know that's a good movie so I mean get something out of it I'm gonna

2367
03:04:22,020 --> 03:04:27,700
go there and I'm not gonna get anything because there won't be a store there won't be no I

2368
03:04:27,700 --> 03:04:32,220
said go to D Street the D Street store has like the Tron jackets are all the hats and

2369
03:04:32,220 --> 03:04:36,860
jackets haven't you seen my Tron jacket like didn't you see that you were like oh you haven't

2370
03:04:36,860 --> 03:04:43,620
seen the hat oh you saw the four different jacket my jacket is awesome did you see that

2371
03:04:43,620 --> 03:04:48,740
picture of me on Facebook with the disc and everything forget it no you need to go find

2372
03:04:48,740 --> 03:04:54,500
it but I need the jacket apparently like now there's some awesome yeah there's a windbreaker

2373
03:04:54,500 --> 03:04:58,840
there's a jacket there's a parka there's a but they're really expensive well get a Tron

2374
03:04:58,840 --> 03:05:04,540
parka that's awesome well okay since you were I'm gonna find that picture on Facebook in

2375
03:05:04,540 --> 03:05:09,500
my jacket and while you talk about whatever else you want to talk about tonight oh um

2376
03:05:09,500 --> 03:05:16,100
the other thing is I like origin over steam I've decided so even though a lot of people

2377
03:05:16,100 --> 03:05:21,780
have been slamming origin you are a fan of it why is this I just think it looks cleaner

2378
03:05:21,780 --> 03:05:27,740
um it's easier to navigate in my opinion I've been playing Mass Effect 2 on it it's prettier

2379
03:05:27,740 --> 03:05:38,380
was that I'm it's prettier yes and that's all that matters usually for me so because

2380
03:05:38,380 --> 03:05:44,580
it's prettier and I can navigate it and I don't know I just like it better I wish more

2381
03:05:44,580 --> 03:05:54,060
things were on it like VVVVVVV or a portal loaded through it I'd be cool but no no it's

2382
03:05:54,060 --> 03:05:59,740
not there but I still like it better I sent you a link by the way are you at your computer

2383
03:05:59,740 --> 03:06:05,420
or did you leave no I left oh because I said I sent you my computer I sent you a link to

2384
03:06:05,420 --> 03:06:10,420
that picture of the jacket I don't want to go by my computer I don't want to see me get

2385
03:06:10,420 --> 03:06:17,580
group kids I've never been group kids so do you think okay then do you think people are

2386
03:06:17,580 --> 03:06:22,460
just being unnecessarily rude to origin because of all these stories about how you know they're

2387
03:06:22,460 --> 03:06:28,300
kind of trying to bully their way in with exclusives and making people use it for battlefield

2388
03:06:28,300 --> 03:06:33,620
3 which is gonna be a huge game and all that or is it just like you don't care it's really

2389
03:06:33,620 --> 03:06:39,200
more that you know steam's been around so long everybody loves steam and here's something

2390
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:43,380
new and nobody wants to try it because it's not steam and so now that they're trying to

2391
03:06:43,380 --> 03:06:48,380
pull well we want to put our own games only on our service that's offensive to these people

2392
03:06:48,380 --> 03:06:55,700
that like steam only I mean it's not like GameStop's freaking platform that sucks because

2393
03:06:55,700 --> 03:07:01,100
it's GameStop and they're terrible it's just EA and they used to be terrible but Activision

2394
03:07:01,100 --> 03:07:07,680
has that title now so we can be okay with EA people need to realize that Microsoft came

2395
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:12,900
out with their game purchase client game for windows yeah games games for windows which

2396
03:07:12,900 --> 03:07:18,540
was a steam clone and they had exclusives I think it was the only way to buy fable 3

2397
03:07:18,540 --> 03:07:22,160
or fable 2 at the very beginning and no one cared because it was just an ugly application

2398
03:07:22,160 --> 03:07:26,940
that didn't have a library and it had game room making sure that no one cared because

2399
03:07:26,940 --> 03:07:31,980
it was just a fable game so it was overhyped and not worth the money well yeah that and

2400
03:07:31,980 --> 03:07:36,980
even the third-party games that they got licensed to sell on their store the library wasn't

2401
03:07:36,980 --> 03:07:42,660
there so like oh you could buy fable 3 or Arkham Asylum which is a great game but between

2402
03:07:42,660 --> 03:07:48,860
the two I'm not gonna start giving them my money through their you know game platform

2403
03:07:48,860 --> 03:07:54,460
so you think people actually have good games you think you think people need to cut origin

2404
03:07:54,460 --> 03:08:02,060
a break and just check it out already yeah I mean you don't have to get all upset because

2405
03:08:02,060 --> 03:08:06,900
you were going to buy battlefield on steam no well you're not gonna use your steam client

2406
03:08:06,900 --> 03:08:12,500
it's a big deal you'll still get it anyway and origins not that bad like I'll install

2407
03:08:12,500 --> 03:08:17,380
it and check it out white and orange I just don't I don't like having like five different

2408
03:08:17,380 --> 03:08:20,460
stores on my computer I already have the games for windows thing which granted I don't even

2409
03:08:20,460 --> 03:08:24,580
use it well you can delete that I know I can delete that but that's I I have game room

2410
03:08:24,580 --> 03:08:28,340
believe it or not I bought game room stuff for my PC so I kind of have to keep it to

2411
03:08:28,340 --> 03:08:34,540
play that but otherwise you know steam but if origin sells a crazy ass like two dollar

2412
03:08:34,540 --> 03:08:38,780
game sale if they have the state if they have the sales like steam does I will definitely

2413
03:08:38,780 --> 03:08:45,020
I might have to do it yeah I don't want to but I will all right well anything else you

2414
03:08:45,020 --> 03:08:48,940
want to talk about me you can have two things running it's fine I have steam and origin

2415
03:08:48,940 --> 03:08:53,700
running all the time together they're friends all right well is there anything else you

2416
03:08:53,700 --> 03:08:59,180
want to talk about tonight me to talk I'm working on Pokemon right now too so I'm like

2417
03:08:59,180 --> 03:09:05,660
trying to divide my time easily between this phone call Pokemon World of Warcraft hard

2418
03:09:05,660 --> 03:09:15,140
I have a Pokemon question for me Klotov if I were to buy one of these two things and

2419
03:09:15,140 --> 03:09:21,780
it was going because I've never played Pokemon so I'm okay oh my god yeah so leave right

2420
03:09:21,780 --> 03:09:26,220
now the studio and go to what time is it there's something's got to be open that can sell you

2421
03:09:26,220 --> 03:09:35,140
it between either black and white or heart gold and soul silver I have to pick one of

2422
03:09:35,140 --> 03:09:39,180
the one of the two generations and that's going to be my definitive Pokemon experience

2423
03:09:39,180 --> 03:09:43,580
which one do you think I should get black and white black and white black and white

2424
03:09:43,580 --> 03:09:48,980
I think it's amazing like soul silver and heart gold are pretty cool because you can

2425
03:09:48,980 --> 03:09:53,700
get like all the old starters and it's all nostalgic but if you haven't played them before

2426
03:09:53,700 --> 03:10:00,540
you're not gonna get nostalgic for that crap and black and white is just overall better

2427
03:10:00,540 --> 03:10:05,580
made like they actually have the sprites that move it's very annoying playing one of those

2428
03:10:05,580 --> 03:10:10,460
games it's like I do an attack well my guy is frozen but he slightly moves forward because

2429
03:10:10,460 --> 03:10:15,060
he tackled you and it's stupid but at least he's like kind of wobble around and they have

2430
03:10:15,060 --> 03:10:22,140
animations and I felt the story was kind of darker too which is which was neat and plus

2431
03:10:22,140 --> 03:10:26,140
everything that I like comes out download wise is going to be for the newest ones and

2432
03:10:26,140 --> 03:10:33,220
not for the old ones anymore so like you'd be stuck with no cool downloads no special

2433
03:10:33,220 --> 03:10:39,460
events just plain old silver and gold but remain to be more fun than they used to be

2434
03:10:39,460 --> 03:10:44,840
but not worth it black and white act deaf in our chat room agrees black or white what

2435
03:10:44,840 --> 03:10:48,900
act deaf in our chat room agrees get pokemon black or white because I just heard from pokemon

2436
03:10:48,900 --> 03:10:53,460
phantom that gen 2 which would be silver and gold is like the best but I guess that's a

2437
03:10:53,460 --> 03:10:59,580
lot of nostalgia talking so I'll yeah I'll pick up white oh which color are you gonna

2438
03:10:59,580 --> 03:11:04,820
get oh I'm not I don't know I still need to use that card for the evil store so I might

2439
03:11:04,820 --> 03:11:12,380
pick up one of those oh it's like like I want you to get pokemon but not in that way all

2440
03:11:12,380 --> 03:11:16,620
right I feel really disgusted me glaDOS you guys are gonna have to talk offline I gotta

2441
03:11:16,620 --> 03:11:21,980
get to other calls tonight fine whatever all right bye enjoy getting cake from your group

2442
03:11:21,980 --> 03:11:27,860
all right hopefully he'll see that picture too and he'll be very hateful let's get to

2443
03:11:27,860 --> 03:11:30,600
another call there's more calls coming in hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

2444
03:11:30,600 --> 03:11:37,940
hey guys it's ddr dollar bill ddr dollar bill what's on your mind not much first off great

2445
03:11:37,940 --> 03:11:42,700
show tonight thank you a little long but that's all right it's labor day that's cool it's much

2446
03:11:42,700 --> 03:11:50,580
for fun that way all right I'll just make a sort of brief but uh they had a sale this

2447
03:11:50,580 --> 03:11:56,700
week at Best Buy where they were so enchanted even for $10 oh yeah I heard about that huh

2448
03:11:56,700 --> 03:12:03,620
yeah I I was like me and about three other co-workers were busy going to Best Buy website

2449
03:12:03,620 --> 03:12:07,620
and trying our best to get our hands it again because they were they were just being sold

2450
03:12:07,620 --> 03:12:16,820
out or back ordered everywhere it's just insane um but I did pick up a copy eventually and

2451
03:12:16,820 --> 03:12:24,580
I want to say I was impressed but at the same time I wasn't well let's let's break it down

2452
03:12:24,580 --> 03:12:29,020
let's start with the bad why why why did you leave with a feeling of me why weren't you

2453
03:12:29,020 --> 03:12:35,100
impressed because I was trying with the kinetic controllers and waving my hands and it didn't

2454
03:12:35,100 --> 03:12:43,300
feel responsive it really didn't feel responsive right like I couldn't I the controls confused

2455
03:12:43,300 --> 03:12:47,700
me a bit because I couldn't tell even from a tutorial which was to lock on what was the

2456
03:12:47,700 --> 03:12:52,780
auto fire what was this it was just bizarre please tell me you tried the controller at

2457
03:12:52,780 --> 03:13:00,140
some point though uh not yet but only because I figured it's part since eventually I got

2458
03:13:00,140 --> 03:13:04,580
the hang of it and since I was used to playing rez a lot I'm like okay now I got the hang

2459
03:13:04,580 --> 03:13:10,060
of let's just play like rez yeah try try try the controller it's just like rez at some

2460
03:13:10,060 --> 03:13:15,940
point try the controller you'll you'll be like okay this isn't so bad and plus it is

2461
03:13:15,940 --> 03:13:20,500
instead of because there's different uh scoreboards for connect versus controller and so forth

2462
03:13:20,500 --> 03:13:28,100
so you do get something out of it true I mean the opening visuals although a little long

2463
03:13:28,100 --> 03:13:32,780
were very good I mean I loved it and I did love some of the uh backgrounds and graphics

2464
03:13:32,780 --> 03:13:39,100
used and the music was okay it's just I didn't really pay attention to it because it's just

2465
03:13:39,100 --> 03:13:42,780
it didn't seem to blend in so I couldn't hear the music I was just too busy focusing on

2466
03:13:42,780 --> 03:13:48,140
the screen uh I think the problem is that so many people were talking so much hype about

2467
03:13:48,140 --> 03:13:53,960
it I felt like I felt like I was gonna get this game and I was gonna go outside and start

2468
03:13:53,960 --> 03:13:57,740
touching people and healing them because I always get the way the god power or something

2469
03:13:57,740 --> 03:14:03,660
like maybe maybe the artsiness of the game was was hyped up too much yeah which is probably

2470
03:14:03,660 --> 03:14:09,460
explains why I didn't like braid so much like I still love braid it's a great game I mean

2471
03:14:09,460 --> 03:14:14,520
yeah some people like the people like to smell their own farts like are really into oh braid

2472
03:14:14,520 --> 03:14:18,800
is an experience but yeah I just think braid is a solid game like it's a for like a download

2473
03:14:18,800 --> 03:14:24,780
title it's just it's fun it wasn't bad it was just it was like the gameplay itself was

2474
03:14:24,780 --> 03:14:33,260
nice the hype killed it the hype killed it the hype killed it yes and the ambiguous storyline

2475
03:14:33,260 --> 03:14:43,560
sort of left me feeling let me feel a sense of blue balls like what the hell just happened

2476
03:14:43,560 --> 03:14:48,160
all right well let's let's try to wrap on a positive note what did you enjoy on child

2477
03:14:48,160 --> 03:14:51,680
of eden what you said you were left with mixed feelings so there was some good what was the

2478
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:56,920
good that you liked um the fact that like I said after I got used to connect controls

2479
03:14:56,920 --> 03:15:02,660
and use the gameplay I figured okay it's kind of like rez but a little easier because rez

2480
03:15:02,660 --> 03:15:08,080
at a few points got to be really insanely hard to the point of where you had a time

2481
03:15:08,080 --> 03:15:14,140
everything precisely otherwise it just didn't work so but child of eden just played a lot

2482
03:15:14,140 --> 03:15:18,900
easier and flowed a little better so you know I was okay with it I thought it was a good

2483
03:15:18,900 --> 03:15:22,500
game I just didn't think was god's gift game but I thought it was a really good game though

2484
03:15:22,500 --> 03:15:27,320
well I think the best news of all is you only paid ten dollars for it most people paid fifty

2485
03:15:27,320 --> 03:15:35,040
so yeah and the craziest part was the pre-owned was 35 uh that's a little backwards I know

2486
03:15:35,040 --> 03:15:41,300
I wonder how many people bought those just to sell them back to another store make some

2487
03:15:41,300 --> 03:15:50,520
money all right uh ddr dollar bill any other thoughts tonight um I had them and they went

2491
03:16:03,680 --> 03:16:06,640
of these tweets here I've been neglecting the twitter because the phone's actually been

2492
03:16:06,640 --> 03:16:13,300
uh uh lighting up here uh steve merryfield uh tweets us saying olr just got tickets to

2493
03:16:13,300 --> 03:16:18,100
video games live here in salt lake city have any of you been to see it it will be my first

2494
03:16:18,100 --> 03:16:22,080
uh yes I've been to see it it was the first time I ever met salacious pop for like five

2495
03:16:22,080 --> 03:16:26,920
seconds was at video games live actually um right remember yeah in person I mean I knew

2496
03:16:26,920 --> 03:16:30,760
you online but it was the first time I met you in person because I I found spike and

2497
03:16:30,760 --> 03:16:35,920
you were with spike I think and no I was with uh frat mad actually yeah and uh I was like

2498
03:16:35,920 --> 03:16:39,360
but I knew I knew I've known him for a long time we've been following each other on live

2499
03:16:39,360 --> 03:16:44,480
journal for years and then right when we shook hands the lights went down yes to go sit but

2500
03:16:44,480 --> 03:16:49,160
the show itself was a lot of fun um I think it's a very fun high energy show whereas like

2501
03:16:49,160 --> 03:16:55,280
uh the final fantasy dear friends was very much a night out at the opera uh tommy talarico

2502
03:16:55,280 --> 03:17:00,260
puts on a fun show and he's definitely about fun and bringing music you know and fusing

2503
03:17:00,260 --> 03:17:05,020
fun we did an interview with him and I don't remember what episode number it is I'm sure

2504
03:17:05,020 --> 03:17:09,200
it's on the olr wiki somewhere and it was a few years ago so it's back there I was in

2505
03:17:09,200 --> 03:17:14,720
the episode 200 somewhere probably uh but it was great and uh you check that it was

2506
03:17:14,720 --> 03:17:19,580
a long interview uh maybe somebody in chat will shout it out if some of the olr historians

2507
03:17:19,580 --> 03:17:29,640
who know their wiki really well uh will find that so um yeah so uh I thought I had a really

2508
03:17:29,640 --> 03:17:33,400
good time at video games live and so I think it's worth seeing at least once in your life

2509
03:17:33,400 --> 03:17:39,080
uh do you agree alan did you like video games live yeah no yeah good stuff all right let's

2510
03:17:39,080 --> 03:17:42,080
go to the phones you're getting another call hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this

2511
03:17:42,080 --> 03:17:49,880
yo it's zino core from the okc how y'all doing hello okc zino core what is up buddy not much

2512
03:17:49,880 --> 03:17:53,940
not much I hope everybody's been paying attention to what the hell good old gains has been doing

2513
03:17:53,940 --> 03:17:57,760
lately because I've been playing the hell out of my copy of wind commander one and two

2514
03:17:57,760 --> 03:18:01,840
I have not had the chance to bring this up I was thinking of it during the break and

2515
03:18:01,840 --> 03:18:06,160
I forgot thank you for reminding me I did play good old games this week I finally made

2516
03:18:06,160 --> 03:18:08,960
an account on there but do you know it wasn't the wing commander thing that put me over

2517
03:18:08,960 --> 03:18:12,960
the edge although I think that's awesome it was the fact that they were giving away Ultima

2518
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:17,920
4 quest of the avatar for free oh yeah that's right I did hear about that one too god I

2519
03:18:17,920 --> 03:18:21,920
miss the Ultima series it was a great series I mean yes I realize there's still Ultima

2520
03:18:21,920 --> 03:18:26,960
online and all that stuff but man the Ultima series is a great series and you know you

2521
03:18:26,960 --> 03:18:30,640
know they were gonna make a tenth one a few years ago and they just it was a canceled

2522
03:18:30,640 --> 03:18:34,960
project yeah it was a 3d a full 3d engine and everything and I think it just got too

2523
03:18:34,960 --> 03:18:40,840
big for what they were planning on yeah it's unfortunate but yes I made a GOG account this

2524
03:18:40,840 --> 03:18:47,320
week to get my copy of Ultima 4 even though I could probably download a copy on an abandonware

2525
03:18:47,320 --> 03:18:51,760
site somewhere but what I love about good old games or at least so far that I've experienced

2526
03:18:51,760 --> 03:18:57,440
is that they have the little DOS box thing fine-tuned to work like I don't have to think

2527
03:18:57,440 --> 03:19:02,760
about all these settings on how to emulate it just works and I like that I like that

2528
03:19:02,760 --> 03:19:07,440
it just works yeah it's worth the six bucks especially with the Wing Commander packs that

2529
03:19:07,440 --> 03:19:12,180
you're getting both Wing Commander one and two and the secret missions I think for one

2530
03:19:12,180 --> 03:19:18,320
both one and two and on top of that they actually have the I what I think is the game development

2531
03:19:18,320 --> 03:19:23,000
Bible for Wing Commander one and two because it covers every character every facet of the

2532
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:28,600
game through Wing Commander one secret operations Wing Commander two and three so it's like

2533
03:19:28,600 --> 03:19:34,020
good lord it's the 50 megabyte PDF file what the hell's in this thing and it literally

2534
03:19:34,020 --> 03:19:37,620
it's like the the resource document for a game design so it's like that that's kind

2535
03:19:37,620 --> 03:19:42,600
of cool you know it on top of my purchase of Crusader Nora Morrison it's like I got

2536
03:19:42,600 --> 03:19:46,160
to give props to these guys are finally getting the games I want to buy from them so yeah

2537
03:19:46,160 --> 03:19:51,160
yeah so yeah good old games is you know if you if you are like why don't they make games

2538
03:19:51,160 --> 03:19:53,880
like they used to or you just want to play something from your youth that doesn't seem

2539
03:19:53,880 --> 03:19:57,200
to work on the computer check out good old games I will say this their library isn't

2540
03:19:57,200 --> 03:20:02,320
vast right now like one of the first games I went to go look up on good old games because

2541
03:20:02,320 --> 03:20:06,760
I like I would have paid 10 bucks for this game if I could find it it's a Sid Meier game

2542
03:20:06,760 --> 03:20:12,000
that's not civilization it's not even colonization and this is actually one of the games he said

2543
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:16,540
he he in retrospect says it wasn't very good because they try to be too ambitious with

2544
03:20:16,540 --> 03:20:22,680
it but I disagree and it's covert action Sid Meier's covert action is like this James Bond-ish

2545
03:20:22,680 --> 03:20:28,120
type of game and its problem was that it was basically four separate games all thrown together

2546
03:20:28,120 --> 03:20:34,420
but I love covert action and I was hoping it was on good old games but it's not I was

2547
03:20:34,420 --> 03:20:39,720
hoping they pick up that one game spy craft that they ran back in like the early 90s that

2548
03:20:39,720 --> 03:20:43,840
was all full motion video and stuff and all James Bond-esque even had live torture in

2549
03:20:43,840 --> 03:20:48,640
there it's kind of weird it's done in our chat by the way is verifying it still free

2550
03:20:48,640 --> 03:20:53,200
right now is at the time we're recording and put a link in chat at GOG.com for Ultima 4

2551
03:20:53,200 --> 03:21:00,840
if you want to check it out yeah so everybody go get it now go on do it now anyway that's

2552
03:21:00,840 --> 03:21:04,320
all I had make sure you love your old games guys as I show your old games some love I

2553
03:21:04,320 --> 03:21:08,000
think that was a great tip thank you for bringing it up because I want to mention GOG but I

2554
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:12,040
got sidetracked with all the Disney talk well here I am putting you back on check all right

2555
03:21:12,040 --> 03:21:18,760
thank you very much I appreciate it looking out for us take care all right bye all right

2556
03:21:18,760 --> 03:21:25,560
interesting we've had a lot of calls that are tonight kind of endorsing online services

2557
03:21:25,560 --> 03:21:31,360
it's kind of neat so wow some people in chat remember covert action I feel loved DDR dollar

2558
03:21:31,360 --> 03:21:35,360
bill says fuck yeah and Kai's you know says covert action is the best I love that game

2559
03:21:35,360 --> 03:21:42,760
oh my god act-deaf to by the way also went in the wiki and found it was episode 285 from

2560
03:21:42,760 --> 03:21:49,800
June 29th 2008 had the Tommy Tallarico interview that would have been right around our seventh

2561
03:21:49,800 --> 03:21:56,720
anniversary show it was probably the weekend before so there you go 285 as to where you

2562
03:21:56,720 --> 03:22:04,360
can find episode 285 come into chat that or associate calm at some point and hell I might

2563
03:22:04,360 --> 03:22:08,960
have it still somewhere but I'm sure is it some folks like dark to see and so forth have

2564
03:22:08,960 --> 03:22:15,600
the old episodes and it might even be on the ol archive dot TK our FTP server thanks to

2565
03:22:15,600 --> 03:22:21,240
the generosity of the web people to put it on including VX Jason XV is just the man that

2566
03:22:21,240 --> 03:22:27,400
helps our website have a place to be up to our FTP some time ago so we haven't actually

2567
03:22:27,400 --> 03:22:32,680
deleted anything from the FTP in like one or two years so you might it might still be

2568
03:22:32,680 --> 03:22:37,900
on the FTP I'm just not sure so one thing that I thought was funny about that video

2569
03:22:37,900 --> 03:22:44,120
games live performance we went to is that I feel that Bay Area geeks are kind of pretentious

2570
03:22:44,120 --> 03:22:51,600
and how serious you know they take everything and that video games live was where they debuted

2571
03:22:51,600 --> 03:22:58,440
their orchestra performance of the time scar Oh scar of time scar time from Chrono Cross

2572
03:22:58,440 --> 03:23:03,840
and they they it was like a medley with a big song from Chrono Trigger and it was like

2573
03:23:03,840 --> 03:23:09,560
the world premiere and everyone of course loved it but we were all so serious in the

2574
03:23:09,560 --> 03:23:14,120
audience that like no no one made a peep because it was such an awesome moment for those those

2575
03:23:14,120 --> 03:23:19,200
beautiful songs to be played but I think Tommy Tallarico was like like he didn't like it's

2576
03:23:19,200 --> 03:23:23,040
like they're all just dead in the audience but we were just all in there and I was just

2577
03:23:23,040 --> 03:23:27,120
really into it like they are it very people don't fuck around yeah and he kept for us

2578
03:23:27,120 --> 03:23:31,180
to play this next song everyone stand up say yeah and like pump your fists and we're like

2579
03:23:31,180 --> 03:23:36,160
we don't do that here bro we're very serious we don't hoot and holler in San Francisco

2580
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:41,320
we're serious business I think that kind of went against his personality but I mean but

2581
03:23:41,320 --> 03:23:47,860
also I I Tommy does great things I'm not slamming what he does but I think to do that like like

2582
03:23:47,860 --> 03:23:53,920
fist pump for Chrono Cross not really like you fist pump for Halo you fist pump for you

2583
03:23:53,920 --> 03:23:57,480
know those those other types of high energy games I'm not saying that Chrono Cross is

2584
03:23:57,480 --> 03:24:00,400
a boring game or whatever but it's just you know role-playing games are a little different

2585
03:24:00,400 --> 03:24:06,720
it's art damn it yes yes thank you it's art damn it all right there's hella people in

2586
03:24:06,720 --> 03:24:11,320
our chat room that are like fuck yeah free Ultima 4 I will say this I had Ultima 4 on

2587
03:24:11,320 --> 03:24:18,280
the NES it was so good like it's just it's hard as fuck but it is good it's a good game

2588
03:24:18,280 --> 03:24:23,480
all right anyhow back to tweets we keep being derailed from tweets tonight let's see going

2589
03:24:23,480 --> 03:24:30,160
to redertainment which game coming out holiday do you think will be the biggest bust I think

2590
03:24:30,160 --> 03:24:35,680
Skyrim will disappoint but uncharted 3 will sell poorly oh that's an interesting question

2591
03:24:35,680 --> 03:24:40,320
entertainment says which game do you think will be the biggest bust this holiday I actually

2592
03:24:40,320 --> 03:24:45,480
disagree I think Skyrim is gonna do awesome but that's total fanboy in me what do you

2593
03:24:45,480 --> 03:24:51,040
think Loki you're grinning over there what what game do you think will be a bust Skylanders

2594
03:24:51,040 --> 03:24:57,400
I fucking hate Skylanders I hope it burns oh is that the the game with the pets and

2595
03:24:57,400 --> 03:25:04,480
stuff it's a game from Activision starring Spyro Skylanders yes you ran it about this

2596
03:25:04,480 --> 03:25:12,460
before fuck that burns and fire um I'm see I would have said Star Wars connect but they

2597
03:25:12,460 --> 03:25:18,240
already bumped it to 2012 so now I'm in a predicament what do I say is going to disappoint

2598
03:25:18,240 --> 03:25:21,760
this holiday I don't know I feel like everything that might have disappointed got bumped to

2599
03:25:21,760 --> 03:25:25,280
Christmas I don't think I can say the 3ds because it's no longer got the Vita to compete

2600
03:25:25,280 --> 03:25:30,880
with well I could say one but it's probably just a no-brainer Silent Hill but yeah but

2601
03:25:30,880 --> 03:25:36,400
I don't even consider that like a big title with high expectations I I don't know I don't

2602
03:25:36,400 --> 03:25:46,040
know what would possibly disappoint so then I reloaded somebody's gonna really hate me

2603
03:25:46,040 --> 03:25:51,600
for saying this I think the game will be great but Dance Central too I think that I don't

2604
03:25:51,600 --> 03:25:57,360
think it's gonna be quite as huge of a deal as the first one and it's because the market

2605
03:25:57,360 --> 03:26:02,200
has been saturated because now you have the Just Dance and so far I hope it doesn't but

2606
03:26:02,200 --> 03:26:05,560
I don't know there's this weird part of me that's kind of like I don't think it's gonna

2607
03:26:05,560 --> 03:26:09,800
make waves like the first one did I hope I'm wrong I hope I'm wrong because I really like

2608
03:26:09,800 --> 03:26:14,120
those games but I just think the markets gonna be very saturated and I'm a little worried

2609
03:26:14,120 --> 03:26:19,880
Knights of the Old Republic MMO you are just going for the throat and all of those wow

2610
03:26:19,880 --> 03:26:25,000
players that are really don't like wow and want Knights of the Old Republic to just finally

2611
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:29,040
take me away from wow please Jesus God six years have been playing this shed be the promised

2612
03:26:29,040 --> 03:26:33,940
land and they're gonna play and it's gonna be like oh no this isn't the solution I was

2613
03:26:33,940 --> 03:26:42,440
looking for that's that's a clever response I like that all right anyhow moving on to

2614
03:26:42,440 --> 03:26:48,880
other tweets spazinator sends us a very interesting tweets well it finally happened I have become

2615
03:26:48,880 --> 03:26:54,200
an ex-bot fuck Sony I'll pirate their shit before I buy any of their stuff again sorry

2616
03:26:54,200 --> 03:26:59,320
I won't be in chat personal stuff going on now if you've been listening to orange on

2617
03:26:59,320 --> 03:27:02,600
radio for the past I don't know a couple of years spazinator calls in pretty reliably

2618
03:27:02,600 --> 03:27:06,720
once a month if not a little more often that and talks about the latest going on on PSN

2619
03:27:06,720 --> 03:27:10,000
especially the video marketplace but he's also run into some major issues when it comes

2620
03:27:10,000 --> 03:27:14,640
to he's had like three of them break down on him so I'm very curious to see what sent

2621
03:27:14,640 --> 03:27:19,140
him over the edge like was it one more breakdown was it one bad customer service call like

2622
03:27:19,140 --> 03:27:23,540
I've got to know like what fucking just because that and I wouldn't I would not see those

2623
03:27:23,540 --> 03:27:28,200
tweets coming from spazinator like what fucking broke him like I've got to know I've got to

2624
03:27:28,200 --> 03:27:33,160
know right yeah and he had problems where he would buy games and then he would get a

2625
03:27:33,160 --> 03:27:37,600
new console but they wouldn't unlock his games for him yeah yeah he had a lot of problems

2626
03:27:37,600 --> 03:27:43,240
with them I don't know so pod culture sent us a tweet that says hello from dragon con

2627
03:27:43,240 --> 03:27:46,800
so we want to say hello right back to pod culture sorry you and bobby couldn't get

2628
03:27:46,800 --> 03:27:51,240
on the show tonight we had a late start live we miss you guys and congrats on your parsec

2629
03:27:51,240 --> 03:27:58,240
award that you won for your podcast the tardis interruptus the name escaped me for a minute

2630
03:27:58,240 --> 03:28:03,440
there but thank you the doctor who podcast moving on to some tweets from tiger claw a

2631
03:28:03,440 --> 03:28:07,080
couple tweets here I read this right before the show this is fascinating to me League

2632
03:28:07,080 --> 03:28:13,140
of Legends shutting down mac support tweets tiger claw a story that after a year of beta

2633
03:28:13,140 --> 03:28:17,160
testing riot games is just canceling mac off support for League of Legends it will be ending

2634
03:28:17,160 --> 03:28:22,200
at midnight on Tuesday they've said quote our current approach regarding the mac platform

2635
03:28:22,200 --> 03:28:27,840
won't guarantee the quality and frequent updates we deliver today on the pc they're not ruling

2636
03:28:27,840 --> 03:28:31,680
out a mac version in the future they say they are committed to building a solution that

2637
03:28:31,680 --> 03:28:35,300
will work on the mac in the long run but it will take some time the shutdown will be effective

2638
03:28:35,300 --> 03:28:40,960
midnight on September 6 now the beta testers who used League of Legends they can either

2639
03:28:40,960 --> 03:28:45,000
get a full refund if they use the store or they can keep their accounts open and play

2640
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:50,320
on a pc all the mac players will get a code for a champion pack a mac player means that

2641
03:28:50,320 --> 03:28:54,360
the majority of the logins came from the mac client those have to also be redeemed before

2642
03:28:54,360 --> 03:28:58,160
Tuesday so if you're a mac player League of Legends go get your free ship before they

2643
03:28:58,160 --> 03:29:06,280
shut it down right pretty much is what it is that's a bummer uh let's see also another

2644
03:29:06,280 --> 03:29:11,580
tweet here uh he sent us a tweet about that whole comcast story it's not directly related

2645
03:29:11,580 --> 03:29:17,840
to games but did you hear about how comcast uh in a nutshell hurricane irene happened

2646
03:29:17,840 --> 03:29:22,120
and shut down the power and comcast won't refund people for it because they say that's

2647
03:29:22,120 --> 03:29:31,320
an act of god but if you don't believe in god tricky tricky uh no you're right it could

2648
03:29:31,320 --> 03:29:36,160
be i don't know but i'm sorry i don't believe in god so they consider a hurricane part of

2649
03:29:36,160 --> 03:29:40,600
that but here's the thing i also kind of why don't you just call it act of nature you can't

2650
03:29:40,600 --> 03:29:45,440
dispute it is nature whatever i'm not going to get into that because it's way too controversial

2651
03:29:45,440 --> 03:29:50,560
for our little video game show however i will say this i i it's not that i'm siding with

2652
03:29:50,560 --> 03:29:54,480
comcast in this i kind of just think you should do the goodwill thing and you know it was

2653
03:29:54,480 --> 03:29:57,680
a pretty big event you should just chip in the extra extra couple days internet and suck

2654
03:29:57,680 --> 03:30:04,680
it up but i mean you guys you guys power outages are gonna happen and like you will be without

2655
03:30:04,680 --> 03:30:10,680
cable tv and you know i understand that's gonna happen but they're you know the power

2656
03:30:10,680 --> 03:30:16,720
company doesn't charge me for power that i'm using when there's no power and you know what

2657
03:30:16,720 --> 03:30:20,800
comcast could easily fucking bury their goddamn lines in the ground we wouldn't have any of

2658
03:30:20,800 --> 03:30:27,520
this problem i i i do think they should just suck it up and do it out of goodwill but i

2659
03:30:27,520 --> 03:30:31,920
also at the same time i'm just saying you know what they're these are risks you take

2660
03:30:31,920 --> 03:30:37,320
and i kind of think it's justified a little bit i think it's bad at customer relations

2661
03:30:37,320 --> 03:30:45,600
but it's it's it's not a illegal business decision i just think it's not gonna keep

2662
03:30:45,600 --> 03:30:50,440
people in their good graces that's all

2663
03:30:50,440 --> 03:30:55,120
when i worked at pac bell and we had a two or three day outage of dsl broadband in a

2664
03:30:55,120 --> 03:31:00,840
certain area or just just like our email service went down for a couple days we would say okay

2665
03:31:00,840 --> 03:31:05,440
you're paying 20 bucks a month it was down for three days i have supervisor approval

2666
03:31:05,440 --> 03:31:11,480
to refund you for seven cents and of course the customer would go completely batshit but

2667
03:31:11,480 --> 03:31:15,960
it's like this this is in our it's in our terms of terms and conditions that we have

2668
03:31:15,960 --> 03:31:22,120
outages right and you're agreeing to deal with that right all right sorry it's probably

2669
03:31:22,120 --> 03:31:26,080
not the popular response you were hoping from us angry people at olr but you know we you

2670
03:31:26,080 --> 03:31:30,460
have to kind of look at both sides of it i'm just happy that the hurricane didn't end up

2671
03:31:30,460 --> 03:31:35,280
being as horrific as they thought i mean yes i understand vermont flooded and some people

2672
03:31:35,280 --> 03:31:42,120
were in bad situations and that really sucks however i'm glad it wasn't as terrible as

2673
03:31:42,120 --> 03:31:45,800
they were saying in the beginning right like we were thinking it was going to be even worse

2674
03:31:45,800 --> 03:31:52,720
so i'm just really glad it wasn't even worse anyhow uh one more tweet from tiger claw and

2675
03:31:52,720 --> 03:31:55,600
this is interesting because it's about i didn't hear about this for the show tonight but i

2676
03:31:55,600 --> 03:32:03,080
guess there is an uncharted 3 trailer that is uh out and it is a portuguese trailer and

2677
03:32:03,080 --> 03:32:11,280
they did a version of it that i guess i guess the way they translated the trailer or whatever

2678
03:32:11,280 --> 03:32:17,040
and the way the voices sound and so forth isn't going over very well in brazil and they're

2679
03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:21,120
going to naughty dogs forums to just basically yell at people and say that you know you don't

2680
03:32:21,120 --> 03:32:24,400
even know what the hell you're doing basically it's kind of like you know when you get a

2681
03:32:24,400 --> 03:32:30,480
really bad english dub here like come on who didn't see one of those videos for heavy rain

2682
03:32:30,480 --> 03:32:35,520
jason jason like you know and it was very obviously french people doing english accents

2683
03:32:35,520 --> 03:32:38,720
you know it's kind of like that similar thing but we take a lot of that for granted because

2684
03:32:38,720 --> 03:32:44,320
you know if it's english the most you know between that and japanese like the two languages

2685
03:32:44,320 --> 03:32:50,460
used in most games we just take for granted that uh the other languages probably sound

2686
03:32:50,460 --> 03:32:58,920
all right too and this is a case where it doesn't so there you go all right and a couple

2687
03:32:58,920 --> 03:33:05,840
more tweets here uh dart ditsuya tweeted us and said here's confirmation the anaheim move

2688
03:33:05,840 --> 03:33:09,840

2689

2690
03:33:16,720 --> 03:33:22,480
