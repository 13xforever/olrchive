20540	28000	bans for theft, and is the Wii U running into problems?
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	35000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of that show
35000	39000	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39000	45000	We are live on this Sunday night and you can head over to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
45000	47000	if you want to participate live in our chatroom.
47000	50000	If you want to hear the stream, hopefully you're already on the stream,
50000	52000	but I'll say it for the sake of the podcast listeners,
52000	55000	you can tune in Sunday nights at www.allgames.com
55000	59000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
59000	62000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
62000	66000	First off, say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
66000	67000	Hi.
67000	68000	How are you, Miss Summers?
68000	69000	Hungry.
69000	71000	You're hungry, but it looks like you're eating over there,
71000	73000	so you're getting that hunger problem fixed, right?
73000	74000	Yes.
74000	75000	It's very nutritious.
75000	76000	Nutritious, delicious?
76000	79000	It's brown rice and tempeh with okonomiyaki sauce.
79000	81000	I love brown rice and vegetables.
81000	82000	Really?
82000	83000	Alright, no.
83000	84000	It's worse than dog food?
84000	85000	Really?
85000	87000	Dog it, chow.
87000	90000	Also, say hello to the one, the only, tech master, Loki.
90000	91000	Hello.
91000	92000	And how are you, Loki?
92000	93000	I'm fine.
93000	96000	And of course, to answer the question in our chat room,
96000	99000	what did you get for dinner tonight?
99000	104000	Well, I got another double bacon western burger,
104000	106000	but I'm not even really that hungry,
106000	109000	but I figured if I don't eat something, I'm going to be hungry later,
109000	112000	because I had a big lunch, but it was round one.
112000	118000	If I don't eat anything between 1 o'clock and 11 o'clock or whatever,
118000	120000	I'll probably be starving by 11.
120000	124000	You know what I had to hold me over for tonight's show is a frappuccino.
124000	126000	That's the food I had this week.
126000	129000	But I will be getting something more substantial after the show.
129000	131000	Hey, it's pumpkin spice frappuccino.
131000	132000	It's really good.
132000	133000	Alright.
133000	135000	What is your kick with pumpkin spice lately?
135000	136000	This is my favorite time of year.
136000	137000	I love pumpkin.
137000	138000	I love pumpkin pie.
138000	141000	They have pumpkin pop tarts now, and oh my gosh,
141000	144000	they now make Hershey's Kisses that are pumpkin spice flavored.
144000	147000	It's heaven.
147000	149000	It's great.
149000	150000	And they don't pay me to say that.
150000	151000	It really is that good.
151000	153000	Or to quote Rob from Wow last night,
153000	154000	it tastes like world peace.
154000	156000	It did taste like world peace.
156000	157000	Alright, we do have a guest on tonight's show.
157000	159000	At least he's going to join us for at least the first half here.
159000	161000	And it's someone that used to come to OLR all the time,
161000	164000	but we have not seen her in a very, very long time.
164000	167000	I think you guys will be pleasantly surprised to hear back on the show,
167000	169000	Miss Irene is joining us tonight.
169000	170000	How are you?
170000	171000	I'm good.
171000	173000	You guys might've known her as Rice Princess about a hundred episodes ago,
173000	176000	but I think she has left that name behind.
176000	179000	You know, it's okay to use it for Orange Land Radio,
179000	181000	because that's how people know me here.
181000	184000	I don't understand when you do want a nickname.
184000	186000	Like when does Prince want to be Prince?
186000	187000	He's always Prince.
187000	189000	Oh yeah, I'm like Prince 2.0.
189000	190000	Alright.
190000	191000	Well, welcome back to the show Rice Princess.
191000	192000	Thank you.
192000	194000	What's new in your world?
194000	197000	Let me have you reintroduce yourself for those that are like newer to Orange
197000	200000	Land Radio who weren't here a hundred episodes ago.
200000	202000	You're a gamer girl, obviously.
202000	203000	Sort of.
203000	205000	I mean, like, yeah, I don't know.
205000	206000	I've kind of...
206000	208000	What, you don't play games anymore?
208000	209000	I thought you did.
209000	211000	It's not that I'm not interested in playing games.
211000	213000	I just don't have time.
213000	214000	But I would if I could.
214000	216000	Have you been playing anything lately?
216000	217000	No.
217000	218000	Really?
218000	219000	No.
219000	221000	I thought you and your boyfriend had a Wii,
221000	224000	and at least were playing stuff on that, or is it mostly him?
224000	225000	It's mostly him.
225000	227000	I have a Gamefly account, and he'll get games,
227000	228000	and then I'll watch him play them,
228000	231000	but I just don't have the energy to play anything.
231000	232000	Well, then get off the show.
232000	233000	I'm just kidding.
233000	235000	But you do love your classic games at least, right?
235000	236000	I do.
236000	239000	And I mean, like I said, I will play games when I have the time.
239000	240000	Just I'm very busy.
240000	241000	Alright.
241000	243000	You kind of sound like a lot like Salacious Pop last week who mentioned
243000	245000	when he was here that he's more into like gaming culture.
245000	246000	Yes.
246000	247000	That's kind of the thing.
247000	248000	Yeah.
248000	249000	So that's kind of where you're at too.
249000	251000	Well, what would you say are like some of the best video games ever made?
251000	252000	Your favorites?
252000	255000	Well, like my favorite is Chrono Trigger.
255000	261000	Final Fantasy Tactics is like it's pretty close to Chrono Trigger.
261000	262000	Super Metroid.
262000	265000	Just like really from the Super Nintendo era,
265000	267000	most of the games on the Super Nintendo.
267000	269000	Like Super Nintendo was just like perfect gaming, wasn't it?
269000	270000	That was the golden system.
270000	271000	Yes, it was.
271000	273000	I agree in many ways.
273000	275000	I don't know if gaming will ever be that good ever again.
275000	277000	Like gaming is just different now.
277000	278000	Oh, yeah.
278000	279000	It just is.
279000	281000	Especially like a game I was playing this week that I'll get into later
281000	284000	in my gaming week is like it's like interacting with a movie now.
284000	288000	It's like it's like it's not I mean, it's not a bad thing.
288000	291000	It's just you know, and maybe this is a little bit of get off my lawn
291000	294000	syndrome, but it's just not the same like it was.
294000	295000	No, no, you know.
295000	299000	OK, so if you have been listening for a while, you know that I hate
299000	303000	Microsoft and like the Xbox systems that they have.
303000	305000	But we actually ended up buying one.
305000	309000	Like I finally allowed my boyfriend to let to have one in the house,
309000	311000	which is a huge deal because when you were on the show before,
311000	314000	you were very staunch, anti Microsoft, anti Xbox.
314000	316000	Yes, but.
316000	317000	Oh, what?
317000	318000	Yes, I am.
318000	322000	No, no, I just mean console wise, like I don't like Microsoft,
322000	324000	but the Wii is a piece of shit.
324000	326000	The PS3 is way too much and they don't have any good games.
326000	328000	And it's just he really wanted one.
328000	331000	And I'm like, fine, you know, I can't hold them back any longer.
331000	334000	It kind of I have to admit that it's probably the best system out right
334000	335000	now, console wise.
335000	339000	So but when we get games on that console,
339000	341000	I really feel like an idiot, like a retard.
341000	343000	Like, I don't know what I'm doing.
343000	346000	They're all first person shooter controls.
346000	350000	And like you kind of have to go to game college to to like learn the
350000	351000	controls on these games.
351000	352000	It's crazy.
352000	354000	You want to go back and just play puzzle fighter?
354000	356000	I want two buttons on my controller.
356000	357000	God damn it.
357000	360000	I'm tired of all this stupid bullshit.
360000	362000	But no, I mean,
362000	366000	I guess it just takes a little bit more effort to learn how to play a game.
366000	367000	But I don't know.
367000	369000	Some of the games are pretty good.
369000	371000	Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here on the show tonight?
371000	373000	Usually our guests want to plug something.
373000	375000	No, not really.
375000	378000	OK. Thought I thought I'd offer.
378000	379000	All right.
379000	382000	Well, you'll be joining us throughout the show and offer your witty insight
382000	384000	and commentary. Please do.
384000	386000	Maybe as we continue on throughout tonight's show.
386000	387000	Dark Soccer wants her mic back.
387000	391000	I really like your Avengers T-shirt.
391000	393000	Thank you very much.
393000	394000	All right.
394000	397000	I just looked over and saw Ms. Marvel and it made me happy.
397000	401000	I want to get into a couple discussion topics before we get into tonight's
401000	403000	gaming weeks and all that, how we always start off the show.
403000	405000	But I have to mention this at some point.
405000	407000	Today's a very big day.
407000	409000	I have to address the elephant in the room.
409000	411000	It is September 11th, 2011,
411000	414000	which obviously 10 years ago was a horrible,
414000	417000	horrible day that we should never forget.
417000	420000	I was fortunate when I was 17 years old.
420000	423000	I got to go to the Trade Center and I have a very vivid memory of being on
423000	424000	the roof of the Trade Center.
424000	427000	But I drove by it with a big hole in it.
427000	430000	Oh, when you it was right after the bottom floor got bombed.
430000	431000	Oh, gosh.
431000	433000	That's when I was 17.
433000	436000	Wow. And it's just, you know, the whole thing,
436000	441000	watching it on TV was just just just so difficult and everything.
441000	446000	And, you know, we have a lot of listeners in New York City and Washington
446000	448000	and back east and all those places that were affected.
448000	452000	And it's like, you know, the impact we felt three thousand miles away.
452000	455000	I can't even imagine just that experience.
455000	457000	So, you know, we should never forget what happened.
457000	460000	However, it is important, you know, video games.
460000	463000	It's something that we do to escape sometimes the pains the real world.
463000	465000	I know when I have a shitty day at work,
465000	468000	I like to come home and blast things on my Xbox. It's fun.
468000	472000	So, you know, if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise just kick the cat.
472000	474000	Stop. You do not. You love your cat.
474000	476000	If we can make you laugh on what is otherwise,
476000	479000	she wouldn't feel it. No, she wouldn't.
479000	483000	I do pet her with my foot, though, so I don't have to bend over.
483000	488000	As I was saying, if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise kind of a tough day for some people,
488000	492000	then I think we've done our job. So and fuck terrorists like seriously.
492000	497000	Fuck them. They suck. So if we do what we do.
497000	500000	Then they don't get it. We can commemorate something else today.
500000	506000	That's right. Let's move on, because something else monumental happened today 31 years ago.
506000	511000	And you know what that is? Loki was born, everybody. It's Loki's birthday.
511000	514000	Yay. Happy birthday, Loki.
514000	522000	So in commemoration, it looks like Irene has actually brought over some bacon cupcakes for Loki.
522000	524000	I love this. Did you get a picture up on the website?
524000	525000	Yes, I did. Awesome.
525000	528000	They should be on orangejonesradio.com. Go look at it now.
528000	533000	I'll eat them later. I can't eat them right now. I'm too full from the other bacon stuff.
533000	536000	I really shouldn't have eaten that. It was too much.
536000	540000	It's like milkshake or bacon burger.
540000	544000	It's like bacon burger. Should have gone with the milkshake.
544000	548000	So any good video game related loot for your birthday or not yet?
548000	557000	Nope. Well, someone, I really hate not remembering. Someone gifted me Xbox Live code last night.
557000	560000	I didn't get to check what it was for yet.
560000	569000	So that's kind of cool. You'll have to check that out. Let's see.
569000	579000	I was going to look up real quick. Ryan Belnap gifted me something from Xbox Live.
579000	585000	I will go check that out and I really appreciate it. I didn't really get on my Xbox today.
585000	589000	It was like last night sucked. My cat was being an asshole.
589000	594000	So I didn't get it. Hardly any sleep. Maybe a few hours.
594000	601000	Today I ended up sleeping in and then it was out to lunch and then came back.
601000	606000	I was messing with Grand Theft Auto stuff. Didn't get a chance to boot it back up again.
606000	611000	Well, I hope your birthday is awesome and congratulations.
611000	612000	Thank you.
612000	620000	We're all in our 30s now. So it's the podcast. Oh, not Irene, but you're just visiting tonight.
620000	625000	So yeah, we're now the podcast for those in their mid 30s. Awesome.
625000	628000	Whatever. I understand what's hip and cool nowadays.
628000	631000	Except for toy trends, I don't understand that crap.
631000	638000	I think they're just making all sorts of weird shit up now and kids are just buying it and I don't get it.
638000	646000	You know what? When kids are maybe about one and a half and younger, they don't care.
646000	651000	They'll play with the box, save some money and buy them a box.
651000	656000	I seem to recall, Josh, your kid really loved the Kinect calibration card.
656000	658000	Still does.
658000	660000	Still does. The wacky, creepy happy face.
660000	663000	They're like, babies are like cats.
663000	669000	You can go buy the most expensive cat toy ever, but they don't care. They want to play with the twist ties and the box.
669000	671000	So if you drop them from six feet, they'll land on all fours?
671000	675000	No. I said they're like cats. I didn't say they were cats.
675000	679000	And besides that, it's not like they have clear vision until they're, you know, 10 months old anyway.
679000	684000	It is pretty true that they do like all sorts of random stuff.
684000	690000	Usually, I mean, he'll chase after sunlight on the floor.
690000	692000	So pretty much anything amuses him.
692000	696000	Save money, everybody. Don't buy them toys. Buy them twist ties.
696000	701000	There you go. All right, going to a couple of discussion topics here before we get into our gaming weeks.
701000	704000	I want to mention this comment from our chat room. Of course, the chat room is always live with us.
704000	706000	chat.orangelaundry.com
706000	710000	This, I think, is an interesting follow-up to what I believe Irene was saying a minute ago
710000	714000	when she was kind of talking about how she had a distaste for Xbox for so long
714000	717000	and kind of just got over it and has one in the house now.
717000	720000	I like this comment from Eric K. I'm curious what you guys think about it.
720000	724000	I'm more loyal to games than systems anyway.
724000	728000	Kind of an interesting comment, and I see Irene shaking her head over there.
728000	730000	What do you think of that comment?
730000	732000	I was nodding my head.
732000	734000	Shaking it up and down, of course.
734000	736000	Yes, of course.
736000	738000	No, I mean, I can understand that.
738000	744000	Well, really, okay, when we grew up, we only had one system in the house at a time.
744000	748000	We didn't have a Genesis and a Super Nintendo and all that stuff.
748000	751000	I think we all grew up in families that couldn't afford that.
751000	753000	Except for you.
753000	756000	No, I didn't have a Genesis and a Nintendo and all that stuff at the same time.
756000	758000	I only ever had Nintendo systems.
758000	760000	I had a Nintendo, Super Nintendo.
760000	762000	Well, I lied because then I had a PlayStation, but I didn't have a 64.
762000	764000	Yeah, I've been pretty loyal to Nintendo.
764000	766000	I threw away a 64 one day.
766000	768000	Oh my gosh.
768000	772000	Well, I bought it from my ex-girlfriend's brother at the time, and then I was just like,
772000	774000	I don't want this, so I threw it away.
774000	776000	You just threw it away.
776000	778000	Exactly.
778000	780000	No, it wasn't even, it was way later.
780000	784000	I just decided one day I didn't want it anymore, so I threw it away. Carry on, carry on.
784000	786000	No, it was way later.
786000	790000	We're talking like in the 2000s when I bought the Super Nintendo 64.
790000	794000	It wasn't, you know, it wasn't a new system by any means.
794000	800000	We still had our Clicca vision when I was a kid, and then we got, my dad got me a NES,
800000	806000	and then I had a SNES, and then I traded with my friend and had his Genesis for a while,
806000	812000	traded back, and then rented a TurboGrafx for like my graduation deal or something.
812000	818000	And then my friend's, my roommate's boyfriend left his PlayStation in the room
818000	820000	because he didn't have a TV in my dorm room.
820000	826000	So I did have multiple systems, but it was because of circumstance.
826000	830000	So I think it all goes with the golden rule of gaming, going back to the comment, you know,
830000	834000	what we always say here on Orange Andrea, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.
834000	836000	Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
836000	842000	I was very much, you know, an Xbox hater for the first generation of Xbox systems,
842000	846000	but then after that, it was just kind of alright.
846000	850000	Well, when I borrowed my friend's Genesis, he had a power-based converter
850000	854000	and tons of Master System games too, so.
854000	857000	I think PlayStation 3 is coming an awfully long way too.
857000	860000	You know, when they first came out, they were kind of the laughing stock of the industry,
860000	864000	and for many good reasons, but you know, despite the hack earlier this year,
864000	868000	which I still say, Microsoft isn't as invulnerable as all y'all think.
868000	871000	Remember, I had $150 stolen just last month.
871000	873000	I have a follow-up on that I'm going to get to in a minute, by the way.
873000	876000	But I think PlayStation 3 is coming off a long way since then.
876000	878000	I think they got a lot of really good stuff going for them there.
878000	882000	Obviously, Little Big Planet is like one of my favorite games ever to come out this generation,
882000	884000	so lots of good stuff.
884000	886000	Anyhow, other things I want to talk about.
886000	888000	I guess I'll mention the Xbox Live hack.
888000	890000	Okay, if you go back about, what, four weeks ago on the show,
890000	893000	I talked about how I had money stolen from my Xbox Live account,
893000	898000	called Microsoft, was told that in 21 days, they'd get the money back and whatever.
898000	902000	I got an email from them about 25 days after.
902000	906000	It was about Wednesday, saying that they, you know, apologized for the inconvenience,
906000	910000	duh-duh-duh, but they did the investigation and that they concluded it was indeed fraudulent
910000	913000	and I will be getting the money back on my account.
913000	919000	And then they sent me like three separate codes for one month of Xbox Live Gold.
919000	923000	So I guess the cool thing is, even though I haven't been able to play my Xbox for the past 21 days,
923000	927000	25 days, month basically, I got the codes.
927000	931000	So now I got to extend out my Xbox Live Gold for three months.
931000	936000	So I guess that's cool, but I'm still waiting for the money because the email I got said,
936000	940000	it may take up to 10 days for the money to actually get credited to your credit card or whatever.
940000	943000	And I'm just like, oh my God, it's been over a month.
943000	945000	That's 150 bucks I had to eat for a month.
945000	949000	I mean, luckily I have a savings account, but it's just kind of irritating.
949000	955000	I mean, really, it takes that long to figure out that a different IP and different MAC address,
955000	961000	Xbox, probably in another country, logged in and did it, you know, it's just, come on.
961000	964000	But whatever, at least it's on the path to getting fixed
964000	967000	and I was able to finally play the 360 this week a little bit.
967000	970000	I'll talk in a moment about some things I was playing on there.
970000	973000	One other thing I want to bring up because I was thinking about this today.
973000	977000	I was at Fry's, which obviously is a big retailer out here on the West Coast,
977000	981000	a big electronics store, and was looking at 3DS games randomly.
981000	985000	And, you know, Star Fox 64 just came out.
985000	988000	And I was looking at the Namco Generations had just come out as well,
988000	992000	which is, you know, for us folks that like our retro games, it's like a Pac-Man reimagining,
992000	995000	Pac-Man Championship Edition, I think Galaga.
995000	999000	It's a Pac-Man and Galaga Legions, or Dimensions, I'm sorry.
999000	1002000	Yeah, you know, Dimensions, so it's all like 3D and all that stuff.
1002000	1003000	And I was really tempted to get it.
1003000	1004000	Don't.
1004000	1007000	Well, here's the thing, I looked at the price tag and I was like, it's 40 bucks.
1007000	1008000	40 bucks?
1008000	1010000	3DS games are 40 bucks.
1010000	1012000	I get that, but...
1012000	1013000	I know, it's Pac-Man.
1013000	1021000	It's interesting to me because they just recently cut the cost of the 3DS from $250 to $160.
1021000	1023000	But I don't know if that's really the problem.
1023000	1024000	The problem are those games.
1024000	1025000	Those games are too expensive.
1025000	1026000	I'll talk to my Namco guy.
1026000	1030000	He's like, dude, I got tons of 3DS games.
1030000	1032000	Well, I just ended up giving them away to my friends.
1032000	1034000	I'm like, sweet, cool, send me some.
1034000	1037000	I mean, I'm not gonna say no to that, that's for sure.
1037000	1042000	But for the masses and everybody out there, and even other games, like Star Fox 64,
1042000	1044000	I might have considered buying it if it was 20 bucks.
1044000	1045000	Yeah, you know why?
1045000	1053000	It's because they claim that it takes extra development time to develop the extra dimension
1053000	1055000	or whatever it is.
1055000	1058000	Or maybe the dev kids cost a little bit more.
1058000	1063000	No, the cost more for the other dimension is a load of turd because they came out and
1063000	1068000	they said any game that uses a z-axis in calculation, you can easily adapt it to 3DS.
1068000	1070000	Well, yeah, it's just another virtual camera.
1070000	1072000	It's ridiculous.
1072000	1076000	Anybody who says that that extra dimension should cost more money is full of crap.
1076000	1079000	No, it's just because it's a new generation, they think they can up the prices.
1079000	1081000	And I think that's gonna be the problem holding it back.
1081000	1086000	You know, and it's interesting to me because there's been a lot of talk lately about how
1086000	1090000	stubborn Nintendo has been and how much they have really not liked the mobile gaming stuff
1090000	1097000	because 99-cent Angry Birds has been cheapening, quote-unquote, the game industry as a whole.
1097000	1101000	And I'm kind of like, well, I don't think 99-cent Angry Birds is the reason why I feel
1101000	1104000	like a $40 Pac-Man Galaga game is a rip-off.
1104000	1107000	I don't care how many dimensions the fucking game has.
1107000	1111000	I'm just like, $40 is a lot.
1111000	1116000	Nintendo's dumb in the sense that they think that a game like Angry Birds, a very basic
1116000	1121000	physics puzzler game, I mean, didn't take that much to develop.
1121000	1126000	I mean, it was probably just a couple guys in a room, you know, putting it together real quick.
1126000	1129000	Done. Game, you just create levels and you're done.
1129000	1134000	They could make a Super Mario Bros. game, like a Super Mario Bros. episodic game running
1134000	1139000	on the All-Stars engine or something like that and make new levels in a level editor,
1139000	1142000	charge 99-cents, and people eat that shit up.
1142000	1144000	You could have just like 20 levels in it.
1144000	1146000	It wouldn't take that long to even make.
1146000	1148000	You don't have to do anything new.
1148000	1149000	Just make new levels.
1149000	1151000	Done. 99-cents.
1151000	1153000	You put it right out there, everyone will buy that shit.
1153000	1158000	The price of all these games really has to make me stop and think about what I really want.
1158000	1163000	I mean, you know, even $60 for a 360 or PlayStation 3 game is asking a lot of money.
1163000	1166000	And there's only a certain kind of game that I'm willing to pay that for.
1166000	1170000	Gone are the days that you would just pick up a game on a whim.
1170000	1171000	You know what I mean?
1171000	1173000	Like, remember when you just, yeah, pick up a game on a whim.
1173000	1175000	It looks interesting. I'll try it.
1175000	1178000	You know, those days really seem gone.
1178000	1181000	Looking at the holiday, there's so many games coming out and I'm really having to choose,
1181000	1183000	like, okay, I gotta drop 60 bucks on all these games.
1183000	1186000	What am I actually gonna buy? Skyrim.
1186000	1194000	See, that's the thing, though, is, yes, gone are the days of buying something on a whim,
1194000	1198000	not necessarily playing something on a whim, especially some, you know,
1198000	1204000	how easy it is to pirate things nowadays on certain systems.
1204000	1206000	Yeah, but that's a whole nother Oprah.
1206000	1207000	You know what I mean?
1207000	1210000	Like, it's just, not even going into the piracy angle.
1210000	1212000	Let's just say that most people don't do that.
1212000	1214000	I don't, I don't...
1214000	1216000	A lot of stuff, like, I'll look at games, you know, they're coming out, I'm like,
1216000	1219000	hey, you know what, that'd be kind of cool to get, but then I ask myself,
1219000	1220000	am I really gonna play this?
1220000	1224000	Because I have a lot of games that I buy and end up not really playing or finishing or something,
1224000	1230000	and I figure I should just finish the ones I have first and then buy the ones I really want
1230000	1234000	and end up just not missing the ones I end up skipping on.
1234000	1237000	You know, interesting comment in our chat room.
1237000	1242000	Part Machine in our chat says, if people played PC games, this would not be a problem.
1242000	1248000	Interesting that that comment is said because one of the places where I do buy things on a whim,
1248000	1253000	just because they're cheap and they look interesting, is Steam.
1253000	1256000	You know, I bought a game on there for like $1.50 the other day.
1256000	1260000	Why? Because it was $1.50 and it was a puzzler and it looked interesting and I like puzzle games.
1260000	1263000	And if it sucks, eh, it's only $1.50, right?
1263000	1271000	So, funny enough, that is the place where I tend to spend a little more frivolously.
1271000	1274000	So, I don't... maybe he's right.
1274000	1281000	Well, just like, you know, like virtual console stuff. Remember, virtual console stuff is like $6 a pop for NES games.
1281000	1288000	I mean, fuck, you can get those NES games in NES form on cartridges for a lot cheaper than that.
1288000	1292000	And I just, I don't see the point, especially when they're not doing anything.
1292000	1296000	They're dumping a ROM into an emulator. Why should I give you money for that?
1296000	1298000	I can go download that for free.
1298000	1302000	Is this a rant about the Mario 25th Anniversary Collection disc?
1302000	1306000	Oh! Well, that's just stupid. And I knew that from the get-go.
1306000	1313000	I'm like, okay, whoever buys this is retarded because all it is is it's just, it's literally a port of the game and they did nothing to it.
1313000	1315000	Nothing at all to the game.
1315000	1321000	And, oh, it has a soundtrack in there, but because it says Mario 25th Anniversary Edition, people are gonna eat that stuff up.
1321000	1327000	And you know what? That right there, that game is a perfect analogy of Nintendo and its consumer base.
1327000	1331000	People will bitch and moan that they don't get their import game in there, but you know what?
1331000	1337000	You're the same dumb fuckers that are buying a game that they didn't change, that they released on the system a long time ago,
1337000	1342000	and they're selling for, I'm guessing, more than what the game actually costs anyways.
1345000	1350000	You only have yourself to blame for Nintendo having $40 games on the 3DS.
1350000	1355000	It's because you're an idiot and you will buy this $30 Mario game. That's literally wrong.
1355000	1360000	They could have put it on the Virtual Console, sold it for $10, and went with it in the same damn game.
1360000	1364000	But no, Nintendo being smart, they said, hey, you know what? We're gonna charge $30 for it.
1364000	1367000	We'll call it limited edition. We're actually gonna make it limited.
1367000	1372000	And now that shit goes on eBay for like $80 because people are dumb.
1372000	1376000	Well, at the same token, today I said no to buying that game.
1376000	1381000	I looked at the game and I said, this looks really good, but I'm gonna wait for it to end up in the clearance bin.
1381000	1385000	Yeah, and I know, I mean, I said the same thing about the Mario game. I'm like, eh, screw it.
1385000	1390000	But at the same time, a lot of other people didn't, and they're all sold out.
1390000	1397000	And I understand, yeah, they may have been quite limited, but we're talking limited as in a few hundred thousand copies.
1397000	1402000	I mean, that's a lot of money that they made from a ROM.
1402000	1408000	Speaking of PC games, that chat comment has me thinking, and Steam and Good Deals, I've gotta plug this.
1408000	1413000	I just, I have to. As a fan of this game, Civilization V is on sale right now.
1413000	1417000	And probably by the time the podcastees hear this, the sale will probably be done, because I think it was just the weekend.
1417000	1420000	But at least for the live folks, it's like $12.50 right now for Civ V.
1420000	1423000	My favorite Civilization since the original, for real.
1423000	1427000	That's the game that last week on the show I said I was up until 2 in the morning playing one night,
1427000	1430000	because, wow, where did the time go? With friends.
1430000	1436000	So, if you like strategy games, even in the slightest, or if you've ever enjoyed a Civilization game a little bit,
1436000	1439000	you should drop the money to check it out. For real.
1439000	1444000	So, anyhow, I guess we should move on and talk about our gaming weeks.
1444000	1447000	So, we always like to start off the show with talking about our gaming weeks,
1447000	1450000	even if we're not really starting the show with it, but whatever, play along.
1450000	1451000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1451000	1453000	I played WoW.
1453000	1455000	WoW? What a different week for you.
1455000	1458000	I got Rebecca Black to 80.
1458000	1461000	I think it's funny you have a character named Rebecca Black that hasn't had a change.
1461000	1462000	I made it as a total joke.
1462000	1464000	That hasn't had a change your name yet.
1464000	1469000	No. Well, I'm not gonna pay to change your name. If they want me to change your name, they're gonna give me a free name change.
1469000	1470000	They usually do.
1470000	1474000	And then I'm gonna name her Becca Black.
1474000	1476000	Or maybe Lady Ark Music.
1476000	1477000	Friday?
1477000	1478000	Friday, that'd be funny.
1478000	1483000	Well, I was gonna change Fatty Cakes to Ursulal, but I like Fatty Cakes.
1483000	1487000	And then I played some Tiny Tower and Sims.
1487000	1491000	I played Sims 3 and the stupid other Sims.
1491000	1493000	This freaking addicting as I thought.
1493000	1494000	Sims Facebook.
1494000	1496000	I just completely rearranged my house while you were here.
1496000	1500000	Sims Facebook is one of those things I am ashamed to admit I play.
1500000	1501000	It's fun.
1501000	1503000	No, it's terrible.
1503000	1508000	It's great. It's really actually just like playing Sims except, you know, you can't rotate your house.
1508000	1512000	Here's the thing. They have got to cool it with the posting to the wall and all that stuff.
1512000	1519000	Like, I thought that they went after the makers of Farmville because that shit was spamming everything too much.
1519000	1523000	And you can't tell me. Sims Social, like, Slices Pop was telling me.
1523000	1529000	He tried to find a video that he posted to my wall and he couldn't find it amongst all the bullshit Sims Social posts.
1529000	1532000	And you can block the app, but that only goes so far.
1532000	1535000	Like, then when you go to the page, it doesn't show anything.
1535000	1538000	You keep having to load because that Sims Social posts so much stuff.
1538000	1539000	I mean, it's just...
1539000	1545000	I want the game to come out on Google Plus because at least Google Plus kind of exiles that all to one.
1545000	1547000	Like, the game stuff all has to be on a separate page.
1547000	1548000	Yeah.
1548000	1552000	I really want Sims Social on Google Plus, but they probably won't bring it there for that reason.
1552000	1557000	That's probably how they've got an assload of players is because it's all over Facebook.
1557000	1559000	And people are like, the Sims? I love that game.
1559000	1563000	I'm pissed off that my mother hasn't become my neighbor and I'm going to fuss at her.
1563000	1564000	No, I'm kidding.
1564000	1571000	But I'm apparently, though, in the game, randomly dating, like, one of my old friends from the AOL days.
1571000	1575000	I am actually a dating Mistress Tia, if you remember her from the show.
1575000	1580000	We're boyfriend and girlfriend in Sims Social, and she came over for some woohoo the other day.
1580000	1585000	I can't woohoo my girlfriend in-game because she doesn't have a double bed, but we can play in the bathtub.
1585000	1587000	Wow!
1587000	1590000	You can click on the bathtub and woohoo in the bathtub.
1590000	1594000	It's going to be one of those weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1594000	1596000	I found the mod, by the way, for Sims 3.
1596000	1598000	Wait, don't you have a spa in your house? You can't woohoo in the spa?
1598000	1599000	At her house.
1599000	1600000	Trust me, you can woohoo in the spa.
1600000	1601000	At her house.
1601000	1602000	Oh, okay. I see.
1602000	1609000	But I did find there's a patch for Sims 3 where you can change woohoo to fuck.
1609000	1610000	Nice.
1610000	1618000	And they're finally breaking the animations where they're doing items with custom animations, so everyone look toward Sexy Sims 2 for new mods.
1618000	1622000	Because I had a ton of them on Sims 2 because I'm a little prevert.
1622000	1632000	I also played some Osotatakeo Endon while I was at school because I was bored.
1632000	1636000	I started reading a book, but I don't like it, so I'm not going to read it anymore.
1636000	1642000	I have to write a review on it, so look on Geek Life for the Too Long Didn't Read.
1642000	1643000	Alright.
1643000	1644000	Plug.
1644000	1647000	Let's move on to Techmaster Loki. How was your gaming week?
1647000	1653000	Didn't play a ton of different things, mainly just Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon.
1653000	1660000	I'm starting to level up my jet character now, so that's at level 5, I believe.
1660000	1666000	And my tactical's at 8, and just playing a little bit more of that.
1666000	1670000	We were trying to play some of the remixed missions on Inferno.
1670000	1674000	It's as hard as Inferno on the first game, which is really hard.
1674000	1678000	Then more Grand Theft Auto stuff. I've been messing around with that.
1678000	1686000	And made some new mods that no one's done yet, so I'll have to work on that stuff later on.
1686000	1689000	What else did I play?
1689000	1696000	I think that's pretty much it. I tried that vid rhythm once, and it was just kind of like, eh.
1696000	1701000	Which didn't end up being a game. Although the app itself is kind of a neat concept.
1701000	1707000	It's a fun little, huh, neat. You run it and you go, huh, neat.
1707000	1711000	But it's not a game, and I was kind of disappointed by that.
1711000	1716000	Because I wanted Harmonix to do an awesome frequency game on the iPhone.
1716000	1719000	That didn't happen. I'm sad.
1719000	1725000	There's nothing really rhythm about it. It's just vid record clip.
1725000	1728000	Vid clippin'.
1728000	1730000	Pretty much, yeah.
1730000	1731000	Anything else in your gaming week?
1731000	1732000	That's it.
1732000	1736000	I know, Irene, you said you've been very busy at school lately.
1736000	1740000	Is there anything that you have been playing in the past week or so that you want to acknowledge?
1740000	1742000	Guild Wars.
1742000	1746000	Oh, you've been playing Guild Wars. Like old school Guild Wars, huh? How's that been going for you?
1746000	1751000	Well, it's been going well.
1751000	1755000	What do you do in Guild Wars? Why do you keep playing Guild Wars?
1755000	1765000	Because it's free and I don't have a lot of time to play, so I won't feel like a stupid bitch if I pay $15 a month for a game that I never play.
1765000	1771000	So Guild Wars, I've always kind of called the game, at least there's always Guild Wars.
1771000	1776000	You know, when you have to quit WoW and Final Fantasy XI or whatever your MMO addiction is of choice,
1776000	1783000	at least there's always Guild Wars if you've bought it at some point, whether it be back when it first came out or one of those ridiculous Steam sales.
1783000	1787000	If Final Fantasy XI goes free to play, I don't know where my life's going to take me then.
1787000	1791000	Well, not to change the subject, but there's an interesting rumor I've come across.
1791000	1798000	They did a survey for the Final Fantasy XI player base about what systems people are playing Final Fantasy XI on.
1798000	1806000	And people are drawing conclusions from this that Final Fantasy XI is looking to ditch the PlayStation 2 because that's what's holding it back, tech-wise.
1806000	1813000	If Final Fantasy XI could ditch the PlayStation 2, they could do all new textures, the game could get an overhaul.
1813000	1820000	That would be very interesting because then Final Fantasy XI could hypothetically look like Final Fantasy XIV but not suck.
1820000	1822000	It'd be very interesting.
1822000	1825000	Why don't we just get rid of Final Fantasy XIV and just pretend it doesn't exist?
1825000	1832000	Tell everybody, hey, you know what? I know you bought Final Fantasy XIV. We're just going to make it XI.
1832000	1838000	We'll call it XIV. We'll just upgrade XI to XIV.
1838000	1847000	Let me go back to Guild Wars for a minute because I got to say, I am really excited looking at the Guild Wars 2 footage even though it doesn't really look like Guild Wars 1 at all.
1847000	1852000	And I know you can kind of start earning stuff for Guild Wars 2 in Guild Wars right now.
1852000	1856000	Are you excited about Guild Wars 2 at all?
1856000	1860000	Fuck yes, I am. Oh my god, it looks so awesome. I'm so excited.
1860000	1862000	Why does it look so good?
1862000	1873000	Because it's not WoW. Every other fucking MMO that's come out in the past five years, all cheap imitations of WoW, this does not even remotely look like WoW.
1873000	1880000	They really try to go out of their way in their developer stuff to really say, this isn't like other MMOs.
1880000	1884000	We're trying to not approach this like other MMOs. We're not trying to emulate other MMOs.
1884000	1888000	But my only issue with that is that's what everybody else has said too and it just ends up being WoW.
1888000	1897000	But you know what, they're able to back up their claims. If you look at the gameplay footage, if you look at the screen art, all that stuff, you know that it's different from WoW.
1897000	1899000	So it's not just another WoW clone.
1899000	1902000	Is that supposed to be a 2011 release or is that not until next year?
1902000	1906000	They haven't even done beta for it. So it's not going to be out for a while.
1906000	1909000	Gotcha. Well good, that's one less game I have to buy this year.
1909000	1914000	It looks pretty awesome from the stuff I've seen.
1914000	1921000	I'm way more interested in that than even like Old Republic. Sorry Star Wars fans, but Guild Wars 2 looks awesome.
1921000	1924000	Yeah, I could talk for hours about it, but I won't.
1924000	1927000	Oh, but you should. Why don't you start right now?
1927000	1929000	And then you're just going to cut off my mic.
1929000	1933000	Alright. Anyhow, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
1933000	1934000	Nope.
1934000	1942000	Alright. My gaming week. I finally, after like weeks and weeks, and I know this is old news to a lot of you, but this is why I've been playing.
1942000	1950000	I played L.A. Noire finally for the first time, which was what I was referring to earlier when I said I was playing a game that felt like playing a movie a little bit.
1950000	1956000	And yeah, L.A. Noire. Wow. I gotta say though, I like it more than I thought I would.
1956000	1963000	I'm not usually super into these Grand Theft Auto games and certainly there's components of L.A. Noire that kind of feels like, oh, it's Grand Theft Auto in the 40s.
1963000	1968000	But that's really just like the driving around stuff and a little bit of the combat stuff.
1968000	1975000	I liked the interrogation and the clue finding and all that stuff, even though I am so fucking terrible at interrogations.
1975000	1980000	I can't believe how much I bombed what is supposed to be like the easiest fucking case in the game.
1980000	1985000	And I think my biggest issue is I am unable to figure out why there is truth.
1985000	1990000	Well, I figured it out, but at the beginning I couldn't figure out why you have truth, doubt, and lie.
1990000	1992000	Because I was like, isn't doubt and lie like the same thing?
1992000	1994000	Either they're telling the truth or they're not.
1994000	2001000	I mean, there's no middle ground, but what it is is that lie means you have the evidence to back it up, that it's a lie.
2001000	2003000	And doubt means you just don't believe them.
2003000	2011000	But, you know, even in the first case where it's so, like their expressions are like over the top, like you can really read them.
2011000	2016000	I was, I got every single question wrong my first time. Like multiple times.
2016000	2018000	Like while I was trying to figure out what's going on.
2018000	2021000	Thankfully the game didn't be all like, you lose, game over.
2021000	2027000	It just kind of, I just got yelled at repeatedly by the boss and finally I got through it, figured out the right answers.
2027000	2034000	But, um, I liked the expressions and the faces look really neat.
2034000	2038000	And the voice acting is well done too. So, you're laughing over there, Irene.
2038000	2042000	Yeah, I mean, the, you know, faces looked neat.
2042000	2043000	Have you played it at all?
2043000	2046000	I have not played it, but I watched one of our friends play it.
2046000	2048000	And I think it's a stupid game.
2048000	2049000	Why do you think it's stupid?
2049000	2053000	It's corny. It's just, I mean like, okay, so you chase after a guy.
2053000	2060000	All right, fun. And then you like interrogate and it's just, it feels unnatural when you're trying to interrogate them.
2060000	2067000	And then if you do it wrong, that stupid ass sergeant guy just like is crazy and he yells at you like he's a psycho.
2067000	2072000	I don't know. And that just wasn't the point when I tuned out because I didn't care.
2072000	2077000	It's just, it's, it's almost like being on a game show because like you find out right away if you fucked up or not.
2077000	2082000	Like you hit the button and right away it just fades up. Incorrect. And you hear a little doo doo doo.
2082000	2085000	And I'm like, God damn it.
2085000	2086000	Yeah.
2086000	2089000	And then they'll yell at you like the chicks all, get out of my store, you're an asshole.
2089000	2093000	I'm like, but you totally looked like you were lying, bitch.
2093000	2095000	Set your store on fire now.
2095000	2101000	See, that's where the game needed more Grand Theft Auto because like, bitch, I'm gonna set this store on fire then.
2101000	2106000	But I couldn't do that because you're supposed to be a cop and cops don't set things on fire randomly, you know.
2106000	2109000	Yeah. Elianore is not Grand Theft Auto.
2109000	2118000	I listened to Dan play the whole thing cause I was in here and I was like, wow, this is historically accurate given the dialogue.
2118000	2125000	And then like I saw the ending, I'm not going to spoil, but I was like, what? That's the ending.
2125000	2128000	Well, they had to leave it for DLC, I guess. I don't know the ending, but.
2128000	2133000	I'm not, no, I'm just gonna say it's what? When, when you see it, that's all.
2133000	2141000	Well, we'll see. I don't know. I have the attention span of a three year old, so I don't know if I'll get that far, but I'll probably at least play it a few more times before I return it back to Loki.
2141000	2145000	I've only had it for like two months. What's another month gonna, gonna hurt?
2145000	2149000	It's funny you say that because a three year old was watching me play well last night and she would not stop asking me questions.
2149000	2151000	Really? What kind of questions is a three year old asking?
2151000	2153000	I was an ice crown too, which was really boring.
2153000	2155000	What kind of questions does a three year old ask about World of Warcraft?
2155000	2159000	Are those bad guys? Yes, they're bad guys. I like bad guys. They're strong.
2159000	2169000	Yeah, but I have to beat up the bad guys, so I'm stronger than they are. Oh, well you're pretty cool too, but that bad guy's a big bug. Do they eat other bugs?
2169000	2171000	You're playing, you're playing Horde, right?
2171000	2173000	No. Playing Alliance.
2173000	2175000	Oh, well then nevermind.
2175000	2183000	Also, you have to remember, Horde isn't the bad guys. It's just an alternative lifestyle. No, I don't know what you'd call it.
2183000	2191000	It's the other, it's just the other faction, you know. Either you're a goat person or you're a cow person. It's just whatever.
2191000	2193000	Space goat, coast to coast.
2193000	2195000	Exactly. Exactly.
2195000	2207000	Other games I've played this week besides L.A. Noire. I revisited the Wii a little bit this week because if you were listening to the show a couple weeks ago, I hacked my Wii and I have a drive now that I'm loading all my games to, which I'm, they're my games.
2207000	2215000	I've been dumping them to the drive just because I can. I don't know, I just thought it would be fun. And now I never have to get up from the couch.
2215000	2223000	Yeah, it's actually forced me to revisit a lot of old Wii games I haven't played in years, so I'm actually kind of glad I did it.
2223000	2234000	And these are all games I've talked about on the show years and years ago when I first bought them. But I played Geometry Wars for a little while today, because you know Geometry Wars had the Wii version, but it's really weird because you have to actually point, you don't have two analogs on the Wii, right?
2234000	2246000	So you have one analog and then you actually point on the screen for your other analog. And the nice thing about it, I don't know, it's a different way to control it. It's kind of cool, you can actually just point at the ships and it's, I don't know.
2246000	2253000	But I like that the game had all sorts of different maps, all sorts of different types of modes. It's a fun game.
2253000	2265000	And then I was randomly playing New Super Mario Brothers Wii today. Why? Because I could. And it was, they really just tried to remake Mario 3 with that game, I think.
2265000	2267000	As minimal effort as possible.
2267000	2269000	Well, it's not a bad game, though.
2269000	2270000	No, it's not a bad game.
2270000	2272000	It's actually a pretty, one of the better games on the Wii.
2272000	2288000	But see, that's the point. The point is, you don't have to spend a lot of development money to make a game. You could put out, you know, something that's very similar to another game, just change up the levels and then you don't charge as much. I don't know.
2288000	2305000	So, let's see, what else did I play this week besides revisiting the Wii? Oh, 360! Since that's up and running again, I played Insane Twisted Shadow Planet. Because I was really into that game and then the Xbox got hacked and I was pissed off, so I played a little more of that.
2305000	2313000	And it's getting to the point where it's getting a lot harder, but I basically have determined that this is like Metroid, but kind of like more of a puzzler. Which is kind of awesome.
2313000	2316000	So, yeah, Insane Twisted Shadow Planet. I think you would actually really like it.
2316000	2319000	Oh, did you try it, Irene?
2319000	2323000	I've tried it. It's okay. That's the one where the robot flies around and he has to use his different like...
2323000	2324000	The spaceship.
2324000	2325000	Yes.
2325000	2326000	Yes, yes, that's it.
2326000	2327000	Yeah, it's alright.
2327000	2329000	Yeah? I like it. It's really fun.
2329000	2330000	Yeah.
2330000	2344000	So, I'm in the ice world right now, which supposedly the game's only supposed to take like seven or eight hours to beat, but some of it's like really hard. Like, the difficulty really amped up really fast from the ocean level to the snow level, I noticed, is kind of interesting.
2344000	2346000	I didn't even know there were other levels.
2346000	2348000	Oh, yeah. Oh, did you just play the demo?
2348000	2349000	Yeah, just the...
2349000	2361000	Yeah, there's more. Like, kind of like how in Metroid you had, you know, the fire area where Ridley was and then like the plant area where, you know, Kraid was. Something similar to that.
2361000	2364000	So, not nearly as good, but I mean, yeah. No, I know what you mean.
2364000	2381000	No, it's not. Like, the thing is Metroid kind of had the characters to kind of stick out and everything in Insane Twisted Shadow Planet kind of just looks like film noir and because it's so vague as to what the story really is, like, it doesn't have that strong character that Nintendo has a lot of their games.
2381000	2384000	But the game itself is still worth it. Absolutely.
2384000	2386000	Yeah, the environment's pretty immersive. I mean...
2386000	2387000	Yeah, and the art style's pretty rad.
2387000	2388000	Yeah.
2388000	2389000	It's pretty good.
2389000	2396000	Alright, so that's going to do it for my gaming week. I think that's enough for that. Let's quickly mention some housekeeping here.
2396000	2405000	Join us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us on Twitter. Also, you can follow us on Facebook at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
2405000	2410000	We will be here back again next week with a show, but we will not be here in...
2410000	2421000	Oh, I'm sorry. I will not be here in two weeks, but I believe they're going to have a show without me. So tune in to hear more on that because I'm going to San Francisco and I'm not going to be here in two weeks.
2421000	2424000	So I think they're trying to find a guest host or something.
2424000	2425000	I want to go with you.
2425000	2429000	I already bought the tickets. I'm sorry. You're expensive.
2429000	2434000	Yeah, that's okay. I have to thank you on air, by the way.
2434000	2435000	Why?
2435000	2437000	For my present for kitty sitting.
2437000	2440000	Oh, and at the Disneyland show when we were gone last time.
2440000	2444000	I has a Duffy now. It's a Duffy purse, but he's cute and he lives on my wall.
2444000	2450000	There you go. Glad you like it. Thank you for house-sitting the cats who chewed up the $50 headphones I own while we were gone.
2450000	2452000	Well, someone left them on the floor.
2452000	2458000	I didn't, you know, you don't think, oh, I got to make sure that the cord isn't dangling a little bit from my desk.
2458000	2462000	Honestly, if I had known, I would have taken care of it.
2462000	2463000	I can't expect you to know.
2463000	2466000	Can you tell me that you've watched that trailer that I just linked you to?
2466000	2468000	No, I haven't. Uh, what is this all about?
2468000	2474000	This is the brand new trailer for Saints Row the Third. It's highlighting their third gang called the Deckers.
2474000	2477000	Oh boy. All right. Let's check this out before we get into the news.
2477000	2481000	You're going to like this. You may have to buy Saints Row the Third.
2481000	2482000	I'm already thinking I have to buy it.
2482000	2484000	I think you should. And this, this is.
2484000	2487000	All right. I'm looking at a trailer rated M. Here we go.
2490000	2491000	And this makes for a great rate.
2491000	2501000	Oh my God.
2501000	2507000	They are dressed up in Tron like gear, like their jackets are all glowing, glowing blue.
2507000	2508000	Keep watching.
2508000	2527000	All right.
2527000	2540000	What? Oh, no. Keep watching. Okay. They're all racing on cars.
2540000	2552000	Oh, yeah. Oh, please tell me they're going to get on light pipes and shit.
2552000	2566000	Wow. They're not even like trying to hide the fact what inspires this, are they?
2566000	2568000	Dude, they're going to get sued right now.
2568000	2570000	I can't wait to play this fucking game.
2570000	2574000	How is this at all like the other two games?
2574000	2575000	I'm, I'm just confused.
2575000	2576000	You don't understand.
2576000	2584000	Because, because with Saints Row, they've decided to just say, you know what, fuck it. We're not even going to just try to be a real game anymore.
2584000	2590000	This is all about excess. This game is just excessive. It's unnecessary and excessive.
2590000	2594000	Each trailer, they go more over the top than the last one.
2594000	2601000	And this, I don't know how you're going to get more over the top than going into a virtual world and fighting stuff Tron style.
2601000	2603000	It's awesome.
2603000	2606000	I want, I want now.
2606000	2612000	Tiger Claw in our chat room also points out the fact that they're called the Deckards is a reference to Blade Runner.
2612000	2618000	So it's not just Tron that's inspiring this, although visually it's certainly very, very Tron-esque.
2618000	2620000	So yeah, Harrison Ford was Deckard.
2620000	2628000	So anyhow, here's the thing. I'm almost sold on Saints Row 3, but it's also one of those, you know what, I don't want to buy into trailers.
2628000	2633000	Just, I'm going to wait for the game to come out, see the reviews, see Loki's review. Very important.
2633000	2635000	I know he thinks he's going to love it.
2635000	2641000	I got to hear, look, dude, dude, what I was listening to Bobby's show before we were live tonight, right?
2641000	2646000	As I usually do on the car ride over and Madden came out this past week, which is usually like a huge release.
2646000	2652000	Apparently Madden has, I mean, I don't really play the Madden games, but I know they're huge and everybody buys them.
2652000	2659000	And they're very important, very, very high profile games. Probably only second to like a Call of Duty game.
2659000	2668000	And apparently the menus fucking freeze and shit. Like just basic shit is broken in Madden, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing.
2668000	2673000	There's literally nothing that this game could do to make me not want to buy it.
2673000	2677000	I mean, there's nothing. Absolutely nothing.
2677000	2681000	And come out and say the next gang is My Little Ponies and I wouldn't fucking care.
2681000	2685000	Although that would probably make me want to buy the game even more because it's so ridiculous.
2685000	2691000	What if you have to play Raiden for the rest of the game? Would you like play it still?
2691000	2692000	Yes.
2692000	2694000	Oh, okay.
2694000	2696000	I don't even understand, what?
2696000	2698000	Wasn't that his name from Metal Gear Solid 2?
2698000	2700000	Oh, okay. I see.
2700000	2702000	Was that his name? Raiden?
2702000	2703000	Yes.
2703000	2705000	Okay. Nevermind.
2705000	2713000	Alright. BlackWolf is in chat actually and points out deckers are also the term in Shadowrun for the grid hackers.
2713000	2715000	So lots of references there.
2715000	2717000	That is very true. I've played one.
2717000	2719000	Yes, I did play Shadowrun.
2719000	2723000	Alright, well thank you for derailing the show with that trailer. It's actually very interesting looking.
2723000	2727000	Alright, let's actually get into the news we were planning on discussing tonight. 45 minutes into the show.
2727000	2734000	And we'll start off with almost an immediate follow up to something last week that came up at the end of the show. Right, Loki?
2734000	2738000	Yes, last week right before the end of the show they were doing an announcement.
2738000	2745000	Square Enix was talking about Dragon Quest X. Or at least they were going to make an announcement about Dragon Quest.
2745000	2750000	That announcement was Dragon Quest X Online. It is an online RPG.
2750000	2757000	And it is going to be, I'm not sure if it's still being, it looks like it's still being developed by level 5.
2757000	2761000	And of course they're responsible for Dragon Quest VIII and IX.
2761000	2767000	The game is coming out on the Wii. Also I guess it's being developed for the Wii U as well.
2767000	2777000	And I guess they're saying also they're considering the 3DS as some form of character transfers or something like that.
2777000	2784000	It does of course require an internet connection being that it's an online MMO.
2784000	2792000	And it's going to require a fee as well. So there's going to be some sort of usage fee for that.
2792000	2796000	It's kind of interesting because there's really no MMOs on the Wii.
2796000	2802000	And considering the Wii is pretty much at the end of its life cycle already that's kind of weird.
2802000	2810000	Yeah, I got to admit. We were talking about this briefly on the show last week because the press conference is about to start when we ended the show last week.
2810000	2817000	And so I drive home, I get home, I go in the house and I fire up my reader to look at what news I missed while the show was going on.
2817000	2822000	And there's an announcement about Dragon Quest X and I'm like, oh Dragon Quest X is going to be online? On the Wii?
2822000	2830000	Wait a minute, wait a minute. Online? Wii? Syntax error? I don't understand. How does this compute? You just divided by zero.
2830000	2843000	The Monster Hunter game over there was, I believe, had paid online as well. I'm thinking though that this is mainly just going to be a Wii U game.
2843000	2846000	But that they're like, well you know what, we're going to make it.
2846000	2848000	Since we promised it on the Wii.
2848000	2853000	Let's make a version also for the Wii because, you know, we still have a user base for that.
2853000	2862000	It's like a Zelda-esque type of thing because remember Zelda Twilight Princess was a launch title but they had to make the GameCube version because they had originally announced it for GameCube and it was kind of the same hardware.
2862000	2868000	Yeah, really more like, oh it was ready for the GameCube but they delayed it so they could put it as a Wii launch title.
2868000	2872000	That's exactly what they're doing here with Dragon Quest X.
2872000	2886000	But that whole MMO thing, they haven't said MMO, right? Because when I was looking at some of the stuff and reading about it, it felt more like White Knight Chronicles to me, which kind of was a single player game that had a huge multiplayer component.
2886000	2895000	Or like, Phantasy Star Universe. I don't consider that game really an MMO. It's kind of like, I don't know how else to explain it. It's like multiplayer.
2895000	2896000	It's Momo-ish.
2896000	2898000	Yeah, it's Momo-ish but it's not, I don't know.
2898000	2912000	I guess. So they would probably have an offline component as well. I don't know if it's going to be online only, but when I hear usage fees and requires the internet, that screams MMO to me.
2912000	2922000	GameGuru in our chatroom says, from the makers of Final Fantasy XIV, from the publishers of Final Fantasy XIV, it is a different studio putting this together, right?
2922000	2927000	Level 5 had nothing to do with Final Fantasy XIV, or any Final Fantasy game for that matter, that I can think of.
2927000	2935000	So, no. These are different teams, it's important to say. I get your joke, but hopefully the MMO experience doesn't completely suck.
2935000	2946000	Or whatever online adventuring experience they come up with, which I'm convinced is going to be more like White Knight Chronicles, which was kind of, like that game's really kind of a cult kind of game.
2946000	2951000	It didn't really break through, but there's definitely a player base playing that game.
2951000	2962000	But, once again, this also begs one simple question. This game is definitely niche. It is very, very niche.
2962000	2968000	You're talking about an online game. First off, an online MMO on the Wii. Not a lot of people are going to bite on that.
2968000	2979000	And, it's an RPG. A Japanese-style RPG on the Wii. That's talk about narrowing the user base down quite a bit.
2979000	2989000	And yet, no Last Story or Xenoblade or anything like that over here. But, yet, they're going to bring that out.
2989000	3000000	DDR Dollar Bill in the chatroom says, Explain how you guys define MMORPG. Here's the thing, I mean, obviously it's a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, right?
3000000	3003000	But the reason why Phantasy Star Universe kind of doesn't fall out of that category.
3003000	3004000	Not Roleplay.
3004000	3011000	MMORPG. Yes and no. Here's the thing. And I'm not saying it's a bad game. God no.
3011000	3017000	Phantasy Star Online, we wouldn't have fucking MMOs if it wasn't for that and Ultima Online.
3017000	3026000	But Phantasy Star Universe or any of those games, it's kind of like you have lobbies where you can interact with people and then you have the game.
3026000	3029000	You form your parties in the lobby and then you really go play the game.
3029000	3033000	But you have chat. You have voice chat. And that was a big component.
3033000	3039000	But there's nothing else. There's no game component really in those lobbies outside of shops.
3039000	3040000	And playing hockey.
3040000	3042000	There's no PVP.
3042000	3043000	And playing hockey.
3043000	3045000	I don't know. That's why...
3045000	3047000	And the giant choo-choo rocket level.
3047000	3048000	I don't know.
3048000	3057000	Well, I think that it better be an MMO because what am I paying online then for? Because the Wii, it's online and it's free.
3057000	3061000	Why would I have to pay to play a game I just bought online?
3061000	3062000	Because MMOs, you pay to play.
3062000	3069000	Well, yeah, MMOs you pay to play. But if it's not an MMO, if we're just talking about a game with some 4 player, 16 player online...
3069000	3071000	And White Knight Chronicles doesn't charge.
3071000	3072000	Yeah.
3072000	3074000	And the sequel's actually coming out here, which surprised me.
3074000	3077000	Sequel's coming out here and also includes the original on the same disc.
3077000	3080000	Yeah, as it did in all the other countries too.
3080000	3081000	Yeah.
3081000	3082000	Interesting.
3082000	3084000	So for those that missed the first one. I did play the first one. I didn't play a lot of the...
3084000	3085000	You didn't play a lot last week.
3085000	3086000	Oh, did it?
3086000	3087000	Or...
3087000	3088000	I might pick it up.
3088000	3089000	It's either last week or this week.
3089000	3097000	The first one's not bad. It had its challenges. And it's weird because you can't actually do the online component until you've played single player for quite some time.
3097000	3103000	It's weird. It's a weird game, but I bet it's a lot bigger in Japan than it is here.
3103000	3108000	And just like Dragon Quest, you know this shit's gonna be crazy in Japan. All these games are.
3108000	3113000	Oh yeah. I don't doubt it's gonna do well in Japan, but their user base is different than what it is over here.
3113000	3120000	Unfortunately, over here, they really wanted to get consoles out, so they got consoles to all these non-gamers because the whole thing was,
3120000	3123000	oh, we're gonna expand our audience to non-gamers.
3123000	3125000	Yeah, how fucking well did that work out for you guys?
3125000	3128000	A bunch of non-gamer people that aren't buying your games.
3128000	3130000	Great idea.
3130000	3135000	And then you totally ignored your hardcore gamer user base in the process.
3135000	3139000	Yeah, that's gonna work out really well for you for this next console as well.
3139000	3144000	It's just, I don't think it's gonna do very well.
3144000	3148000	I mean, just look at all the other niche hardcore games that have been out there.
3148000	3153000	RPGs and, you know, non-RPGs, they just haven't done well.
3153000	3159000	And I understand this is gonna be published probably by, I don't know if it's Square Enix, I'm guessing Nintendo,
3159000	3164000	because they did the last Dragon Quest game and Dragon Quest Monsters 2 and stuff like that.
3164000	3169000	So if it's published by Nintendo, I mean, there'll be some more marketing behind that,
3169000	3175000	but it's gonna be tough, especially convincing people.
3175000	3179000	First off, I don't know, it'll be tough.
3179000	3182000	I just need to really see more of the game before I can really make a call.
3182000	3187000	I gotta play the game, see some reviews, see some trailers that aren't just cut scenes.
3187000	3188000	Oh, you skeptic.
3188000	3191000	No, I mean, I just love Dragon Quest VIII.
3191000	3195000	Oh my god, that game was so fucking good on the PlayStation, but, you know, I just...
3195000	3196000	We'll see.
3196000	3198000	Again, if it's worth the pain.
3198000	3201000	But it sounds like there's gonna be still at least a full single-player game,
3201000	3203000	and that part I kinda like, at least.
3203000	3204000	I mean, Phantasy Star Universe is the same way.
3204000	3206000	Yeah, if it's got that, then that's fine.
3206000	3210000	Then it's worth a purchase, because then you don't have to play the online portion of it.
3210000	3216000	And if they're gonna go the whole Phantasy Star online route, then that's fine.
3216000	3223000	But it's just if they're going just an MMO route, that's gonna be a difficult sell.
3223000	3227000	Alright, well, let's see if this is going to be a difficult sell to people.
3227000	3232000	It's basically been confirmed by Nintendo that it is true.
3232000	3235000	Some of the rumors that were rumbling last week and the week before is playing out.
3235000	3239000	And you can thank Famitsu Magazine for leaking an earlier picture of this.
3239000	3243000	It is a 3DS circle pad attachment.
3243000	3251000	The 3DS will plug into this kind of, it looks like a docking bay sort of thing that has, yes, another analog stick on the right-hand side.
3251000	3258000	Along with this announcement came an announcement that they are making Monster Hunter tri-G on the 3DS,
3258000	3262000	which, you know, requires a second analog controller just the way the game is.
3262000	3268000	So now it's kind of confusing is, did they do this circle attachment just to get the Monster Hunter game,
3268000	3271000	or is this the future of the 3DS right here?
3271000	3278000	And so, you know, a lot of early adopters of the system, now, at least I can speak myself, now I'm getting a little pissed.
3278000	3281000	Like, I wasn't pissed when they cut the price.
3281000	3288000	I especially wasn't pissed when they said, we're gonna cut the price and to help ease the pain, we're gonna throw you 20 free virtual console games.
3288000	3289000	Cool, fine, I'm fine.
3289000	3298000	But now that my original 3DS may be just kind of now irrelevant and I'm gonna have to buy this extra attachment for it,
3298000	3302000	if I have to buy, I mean, I don't know if I would play a Monster Hunter game,
3302000	3306000	but if this ends up being the norm, which I worry it could be?
3306000	3311000	They're, they're obviously, I mean, if Nintendo's making a peripheral for this game,
3311000	3316000	and I know Monster Hunter's gonna be big in Japan, it's if it even comes out over here,
3316000	3321000	if they're making a peripheral for this, you better damn well believe that it's gonna be used for something other than just one game.
3321000	3325000	I mean, why even bother if it's gonna be for just one game?
3325000	3331000	And yeah, as you said, the cost thing, you didn't give me free games because you dropped the price of the system,
3331000	3335000	you know what, you didn't even have to do that, because I understand the price is gonna drop,
3335000	3340000	yeah, it was a little bit sooner than I had thought, but whatever, you know what, that's so bad, too well.
3340000	3345000	Whatever, so I bought the system back in March, I had it a few months with no games,
3345000	3350000	and you know, you dropped it and it gave me some free virtual console games, which I've not played.
3350000	3355000	And, you know, that's fine, but this is gonna split your user base in half now.
3355000	3361000	Now, this is great, because now everyone thinks that the system is gonna be redesigned, whether it is or not,
3361000	3366000	and all the people that are thinking about, hey, you know, I really need to pick up a 3DS this holiday
3366000	3370000	to pick up some, you know, Mario and Mario Kart games and stuff like that,
3370000	3375000	and whatever else they have coming for the 3DS, people are gonna wait.
3375000	3377000	It's gonna be interesting to see what Nintendo says to this press conference,
3377000	3381000	because I'm looking at our chatroom, of course, it's lighting up on this story, chat.orangelandradio.com,
3381000	3387000	if you want to join us live. Zether in chat says, as of now, that add-on is only for Monster Hunter tri-G.
3387000	3392000	And I'm kind of going, okay, yeah, as of now, but there's certainly that skeptic in me that's saying,
3392000	3395000	but now that that's out there, who else might use it?
3395000	3399000	Now, granted, just because the peripheral exists doesn't mean everybody's gonna use it,
3399000	3405000	like I think of, okay, that Metroid pinball game had that rumble pack in the DS, remember that thing?
3405000	3409000	That was a real flash in the pan, right? And I don't think any other games really used it.
3409000	3411000	Yeah, there's a bunch of games that used it.
3411000	3414000	Were there? Huh, I thought there were like one or two.
3414000	3419000	Not a lot, but that thing right there, though, that's not necessary to play the game.
3419000	3423000	Rumble, eh, whatever, so my system doesn't rumble. That's not a big deal.
3423000	3425000	None of them do nowadays anyways.
3425000	3431000	But a second analog stick is kind of important. That's like saying, oh, you know, we added some buttons.
3431000	3436000	In fact, that does add a couple shoulder buttons to the thing as well, and a trigger, I think.
3436000	3440000	So that's a big deal, because now you have dual analogs,
3440000	3445000	so you could do first-person shooters on that system quite well now.
3445000	3449000	I do want to point out it is not only adding a second analog stick. I haven't mentioned this.
3449000	3452000	There's also going to be shoulder buttons on it.
3452000	3455000	And what's also interesting that some have pointed out,
3455000	3462000	this little docking bay now will make your 3DS match the configuration of a Wii U controller.
3462000	3466000	Not saying that it can serve as a replacement for a Wii U controller yet,
3466000	3473000	but some folks are going, isn't that interesting that now it matches the configuration of a Wii U controller?
3473000	3480000	And could it be all this call about, gee, what do you mean the system's only going to come with one Wii U controller
3480000	3482000	and we're not going to buy a second controller separately?
3482000	3484000	Could this be the path we're going down?
3484000	3487000	Yep. That's exactly what they're doing.
3487000	3490000	Because you know when that controller first came out,
3490000	3494000	listen to the episodes of OLR leading up to the reveal of the Wii U,
3494000	3498000	because it's very interesting, because we were theorizing and theorizing,
3498000	3502000	and then all of a sudden it just kind of dawned on us that, duh,
3502000	3508000	everything we have heard about this was clearly just the Wii U controller is a freaking DS without the top screen.
3508000	3511000	That's what the Wii U controller is. And a few more buttons.
3511000	3515000	Well, here's your few more buttons now. It's very interesting,
3515000	3520000	and this Nintendo conference that's coming up, what, tomorrow?
3520000	3522000	Going to be very interesting.
3522000	3525000	So, I just can't wait to hear their rational-
3525000	3531000	I just- I want to see if they only announce the Monster Hunter thing for this,
3531000	3537000	or if they say a new Pokemon game, and the Pokemon game's going to use two analog sticks too,
3537000	3540000	because then it's over, all the games are using it.
3540000	3544000	It's not just one game. I mean, come on, it's a peripheral that, you know,
3544000	3546000	I think a lot of developers would be like,
3546000	3551000	hey, that's awesome, now we don't have to do some crazy control scheme with the touch screen or whatever.
3551000	3554000	I mean, it would make a lot of games easy to port over.
3554000	3556000	Especially stuff that they're going to be doing on the Vita,
3556000	3560000	and then porting over to the 3DS and stuff like that, it would make it a lot easier.
3560000	3565000	But, at the same time, you should have fucking thought of this when you're designing your system.
3565000	3568000	Hey, I don't know, let's see, there's the PSP.
3568000	3570000	What was the number one bitch about the PSP?
3570000	3573000	It doesn't have a fucking second analog stick.
3573000	3577000	What'd you think, hey, you know what, maybe people want a second analog stick.
3577000	3583000	Huh, could that be possibly what people want, since they're saying I want a second analog stick.
3583000	3586000	Nah, that's not what they want, they just want one analog stick.
3586000	3590000	That's what we're going to do, we're just going to leave them with just one analog stick.
3590000	3594000	Oh damn, you know, a big game comes out that needs a second analog stick.
3594000	3598000	Ah, crap, we better make another adjustment to this.
3598000	3602000	Yeah, I'd be pissed even if it isn't an accessory or whatever.
3602000	3607000	Not only does it make it, you know, how the fuck am I supposed to carry that around with me now?
3607000	3610000	It's not going to fucking fit in my pocket.
3610000	3616000	Now, again, we have to really wait until after Nintendo makes the official announcement,
3616000	3619000	because I think it's still, even though we have the picture and everything,
3619000	3622000	it's still too early to say what the point of this is.
3622000	3626000	Is this a Monster Hunter add-on or is this, we don't know.
3626000	3631000	But we're all looking at it going, gosh, it makes your 3DS look like a Wii U controller,
3631000	3634000	yeah, a lot of people want to have that second analog stick,
3634000	3638000	we've heard rumors about a 3DS redesign anyway,
3638000	3641000	it would all add up, this is probably happening.
3641000	3644000	I kind of akin this to, and I see some folks in chat are talking about,
3644000	3649000	well not every peripheral goes on forever, like the e-reader, printer and so forth,
3649000	3652000	and I go, and none of these are ever required, but then I go,
3652000	3655000	but what about the Wii Plus motion thing?
3655000	3656000	Wii Motion Plus.
3656000	3658000	Wii Motion Plus didn't come out until later,
3658000	3661000	and now it's like if you want to play the new Zelda game, you have to have it.
3661000	3664000	So it would not be unheard of for Nintendo to require this in the future.
3664000	3667000	This is more along the lines of Wii Motion Plus than it is the e-reader.
3667000	3672000	E-reader, those are all gimmicky things that weren't necessary, like the rumble pack.
3672000	3676000	That's not necessary to play a DS game, it was just a gimmicky thing.
3676000	3678000	The e-reader was actually a really kind of cool idea, I gotta say.
3678000	3681000	It was a cool idea, but it was still a gimmick.
3681000	3684000	You could have done something else, you know, to...
3684000	3688000	How awesome was it to have an old school NES game on five cards in your pocket?
3688000	3690000	That was kind of cool, I'm sorry.
3690000	3695000	Yeah, it's pretty cool, but at the same time though, this is another analog stick.
3695000	3701000	This is adding another joystick. This is very significant.
3701000	3705000	And it's a few extra buttons on there, which by the way,
3705000	3707000	it's kind of interesting now that I think of it,
3707000	3711000	it's probably gonna use that IR port that's on the back of that fucking 3DS
3711000	3714000	that everyone's like, what the hell's this IR port for?
3714000	3715000	Great.
3715000	3718000	But, it's just...
3718000	3719000	Alright.
3719000	3723000	I mean, we've got more stories to talk about, you know, the 3DS and...
3723000	3725000	Well, let me bring some of these up real quick.
3725000	3729000	3DS, obviously the price cut happened and a lot of you are very happy about it.
3729000	3731000	How many of you are happy about it?
3731000	3735000	Over 260% are buying this now than were before.
3735000	3741000	3DS sold 185,000 units between the price cut and the month's end.
3741000	3745000	That's a 260% increase over that same time period in July.
3745000	3749000	So it does mean that this has motivated sales a little more
3749000	3752000	and this is a trend that's gonna continue through Christmas, guaranteed.
3752000	3757000	I still think, especially now that the Vita's not around this Christmas,
3757000	3759000	this thing's gonna sell like crazy over the holidays.
3759000	3762000	Despite all this other crap we're talking about.
3762000	3767000	Soccer moms don't know about... Soccer moms are not reading Famitsu magazine in Japan.
3767000	3773000	I honestly think that the whole thing with the 3DS was really very carefully planned.
3773000	3776000	They knew they didn't have a good thing out quite yet
3776000	3779000	but at least at the higher price anyway with the intention of dropping the price
3779000	3782000	because they knew it would...
3782000	3784000	I mean, sales would happen after a price drop.
3784000	3785000	I don't think so.
3785000	3789000	I kinda actually disagree because I think Nintendo saw the reception at E3
3789000	3792000	and was like, holy shit, we've struck gold with this thing.
3792000	3793000	We gotta get it out now.
3793000	3796000	And they put it out in some ways too soon.
3796000	3801000	But where I will hit is that I think the strategy all along was a build up to Christmas.
3801000	3805000	I think they released it at the end of the fiscal year to pad the low sales a wee
3805000	3807000	and then it's gonna just...
3807000	3811000	The price drop, on the other hand, I don't think that was planned.
3811000	3813000	No, because if they were planning on doing...
3813000	3815000	Well, no one plans on dropping the price of that.
3815000	3817000	I mean, they've gotta be selling at a loss now.
3817000	3823000	And if they weren't selling at a loss and they had that much of a margin in there,
3823000	3826000	they could have fit a second fuckin' analog stick in there.
3826000	3829000	I mean, an analog stick doesn't cost hardly anything.
3829000	3832000	It's maybe $10 to put in that system.
3832000	3834000	I doubt it's even $10.
3834000	3836000	I've bought replacements for my PSP.
3836000	3841000	The 3DS production cost is $101 per unit.
3843000	3844000	Wow.
3844000	3847000	So, including overhead...
3847000	3849000	They're probably still pulling a profit on it.
3849000	3852000	So they could have charged $10 extra dollars in what they're charging now
3852000	3854000	and added a second analog stick all along.
3854000	3855000	And you know what?
3855000	3856000	Hey, guess what, Nintendo?
3856000	3859000	It's a good thing to have things on your system,
3859000	3861000	like say a second analog stick that,
3861000	3864000	yeah, you know what, you may not have a use for it right now,
3864000	3867000	but publishers would probably want that.
3867000	3870000	You know, it makes development of games a little bit easier.
3870000	3873000	There's some funky right analog stick using the touch screen.
3873000	3876000	I find this fascinating, one other little thing about the DS family,
3876000	3880000	because this is about DSi XL, which is still out, still selling,
3880000	3882000	at the same price as the 3DS.
3882000	3886000	I was at Fry's today, and Salacious Pop really wants a DSi XL,
3886000	3889000	because, you know, he has a lot of DS games and he just kind of wants one.
3889000	3891000	I'm not going to question if somebody wants something.
3891000	3893000	You know, and has been talking about it,
3893000	3897000	but it's the same price as the 3DS right now, which I find fascinating.
3897000	3899000	And it's not dead.
3899000	3900000	It's far from it.
3900000	3906000	They've just announced that on September 18th there will be a metallic rose DSi XL.
3906000	3907000	It's fucking pink.
3907000	3910000	It's a fucking pink DSi, and it's coming out on September 18th.
3910000	3912000	You know what, I kind of want it.
3912000	3917000	In the same way that I wanted my pink advance that I have the afterburner in,
3917000	3918000	I kind of want this now.
3918000	3919000	I mean, you know, whatever.
3919000	3922000	The DSi XL, you know, the screens are really big, it's kind of nice, whatever,
3922000	3926000	but it is weird that it's the same price as the 3DS.
3926000	3928000	That's a little weird to me.
3928000	3930000	DS Lite, by the way, are still on shelves.
3930000	3932000	There's a really pretty blue one.
3932000	3936000	99 bucks for DS Lite.
3936000	3939000	That's interesting to me.
3939000	3941000	Huh, all right.
3941000	3942000	I don't get empty.
3942000	3945000	You know what, these people that buy this pink system that's coming out,
3945000	3948000	the same price as the 3DS,
3948000	3950000	you deserve all those high-priced games and shit.
3950000	3953000	All right, well, we're going to revisit all of this again next week
3953000	3956000	because the Nintendo press conference is happening in a couple days,
3956000	3958000	and who knows what curveballs are going to come out of that.
3958000	3960000	There could be that.
3960000	3964000	I mean, if a Pokémon game is announced, good lord, it's...
3964000	3965000	They already have a Pokémon game.
3965000	3966000	What Pokémon game would...
3966000	3968000	Not 3D.
3968000	3972000	I'm sorry, yes, they have a Pokémon, but it's a Pokémon...
3972000	3974000	It's like Pokémon Snap.
3974000	3977000	Pokémon Snap is not really a Pokémon game, you know what I mean?
3977000	3980000	Like, they need a Pokémon magenta, and Pokémon...
3980000	3985000	There's no Pokémon game that's going to need a second analog stick.
3985000	3987000	Maybe you just haven't thought of it yet.
3987000	3989000	A Pokémon first-person shooter.
3989000	3991000	That would be all sorts of lame.
3991000	3993000	No, that would be awesome, are you kidding?
3993000	3995000	No, it would be stupid.
3995000	4000000	Pokémon first-person shooter, wasn't that pretty much Pokémon Snap?
4000000	4001000	Pretty much.
4001000	4004000	Because you're shooting from a first-person perspective.
4004000	4005000	Oh, get out.
4005000	4007000	You know what, no, I agree.
4007000	4009000	It was a first-person shooter.
4009000	4011000	You just shot photos of them and not, you know,
4011000	4015000	shooting them dead with bullets into their, you know, cute little fuzzy heads.
4015000	4017000	I'm just saying Goldeneye would have been that much better
4017000	4019000	if it was Pikachu killing people.
4019000	4020000	Just saying.
4022000	4024000	Anyhow, let's move on.
4024000	4026000	Dark Sakura.
4026000	4027000	How about Crytek?
4027000	4028000	Fail.
4028000	4034000	Um, one of their, I guess, former employees decided
4034000	4037000	that they were going to go off on Tumblr.
4037000	4041000	There's an anonymous account which I took the liberty
4041000	4043000	of reblogging everything on our Tumblr.
4043000	4044000	Hint, hint, hint.
4044000	4046000	Orangelangeradio.tumblr.com.
4046000	4054000	And, basically, he's listing this whole, just crazy line of stuff
4054000	4056000	that, you know, they've done that's illegal.
4056000	4060000	Going over this, he said, I'm going to read a little bit.
4060000	4064000	From the outside, Crytek produces some of the most graphically pleasing games around.
4064000	4068000	Those being Far Cry, Crysis, Crysis, Warhead, and Crysis 2.
4068000	4070000	Four games in ten years.
4070000	4075000	The work of the individuals should be proud of what they've done.
4075000	4080000	But they've basically said that there's a bullying mentality given at the CEO levels.
4080000	4085000	Where they're delivered lines like, you should be proud to work for Crytek,
4085000	4088000	yet demanding six months of crunch time due to project management failures.
4088000	4093000	This caused certain members of staff to suffer both in medical and personal ways.
4093000	4097000	And he's listing, alright, this polluted the work atmosphere that resulted in the resignation
4097000	4102000	and or unlawful firing of global talent manager, global head of resourceful humans,
4102000	4106000	lead game designer, lead community manager, community manager, lead researcher,
4106000	4112000	storyboard and concept artist, and a whole list of developers and designers.
4112000	4120000	And, so basically, the article, you know, he's just there on Tumblr pretty much blasting them.
4120000	4124000	I mean, nothing really specifically listed, just said that a lot of senior staff was made redundant
4124000	4130000	and that employees were, quote, allowed to work longer hours and weekend days.
4130000	4134000	Which, again, Crytek's a German developer in violation of German law.
4134000	4144000	Now, the co-founder, Avni Yearly, said, and he spoke with Develop about these practices
4144000	4147000	and said that they were misleading accusations and, quote,
4147000	4151000	is very distressing for us to think that an individual thinks we've been treating them unfairly.
4151000	4156000	It's very disappointing. So, I actually found a rebuttal on the same Tumblr.
4156000	4163000	And he goes on saying, as previously mentioned, we do not aim to mislead or give erroneous opinions
4163000	4167000	as this would ultimately decrease the strength on which the blog was first created.
4167000	4171000	And it is nothing but bring into doubt the levels of truth featured within.
4171000	4177000	So, he said, if German labor codes were being met and strictly adhered to,
4177000	4184000	there would be no need for the successful court cases against Crytek GmbH in which a company lawyer was present.
4184000	4190000	Crytek, if you can provide proof that no one has ever successfully claimed compensation due to an illegal firing,
4190000	4192000	then please do so. You cannot.
4192000	4196000	And, so basically, just going on. You can read this all if you want to.
4196000	4201000	I've linked them both on our Tumblr. But it's, like, it really goes long.
4201000	4205000	And he's talking, just, this is clearly somebody who was there.
4205000	4211000	It's one of those cases where I think you go, okay, you know, you read this and you go,
4211000	4215000	well, another person complaining about the development industry, what a shock.
4215000	4222000	It's probably true. But then you look at it and you go, well, he probably does have a lot of bitterness issues.
4222000	4223000	Obviously, something happened there.
4223000	4225000	None of this reads like anyone bitter.
4225000	4228000	I just, I still think the answer's probably in the middle somewhere.
4228000	4233000	It's probably, you know, and I think I just said this two weeks ago on the show in a very similar story.
4233000	4239000	There's your side of the story, my side of the story, and the truth somewhere in the middle.
4239000	4241000	It's probably what's happening here, too.
4241000	4245000	Well, there's another line on here, though, that I think is a very good point.
4245000	4248000	Enforcing weekend work and expecting them to come in are two different things.
4248000	4251000	As an employee, you know that if you aren't showing the drive and ambition to become a team player,
4251000	4255000	your direct line manager may take a negative stance on your progression in the company.
4255000	4261000	So basically, it's talking about the impact it has on home life, on employee well-being,
4261000	4266000	which is actually something that I think is a big problem here in the U.S., to be perfectly honest.
4266000	4271000	But I don't, I really don't read any bitterness into any of this.
4271000	4277000	This is someone who loved his job or her job and was proud of the work that they did
4277000	4285000	and found that the entire, just from reading the whole thing, found that the work environment is what soured it.
4285000	4291000	They're very proud of their work, very proud of what they did, but it was all environmental.
4291000	4296000	Well, it'll be interesting to see if this anonymous person is forced to reveal themselves later on or what happens.
4296000	4298000	I just want to end it with the last line.
4298000	4305000	We make and made great games, and we just want to see the atmosphere and blatant disregard for employee morale improve.
4305000	4307000	All right.
4307000	4309000	So, more power to you. Good luck.
4309000	4310000	Let's move on.
4310000	4317000	All right. So, we talked a little bit about Ubisoft and their different DRM that they're going to have for upcoming games.
4317000	4327000	One of the first ones that was going to take place on console was this new Uplay Passport thing that they were doing with Driver San Francisco.
4327000	4331000	Problem was, it didn't quite go as planned.
4331000	4342000	Driver San Francisco on Xbox 360 was supposed to include a Uplay Passport code required to access multiplayer beyond a 48 hour trial period.
4342000	4349000	However, they forgot to put the codes in many of the copies that went out.
4349000	4352000	Brilliant work.
4352000	4356000	Yes. So, what ended up happening, and this is only really in North America.
4356000	4362000	What ended up happening, though, is the people that bought it, you can actually get the Passport for free.
4362000	4365000	You just either sign in and there's two options.
4365000	4376000	There's one to start my two day free trial, which will not expire now, or select Uplay Passport Purchase, which will be provided at no charge.
4376000	4385000	So, if you wanted to right now, you could purchase that game for, you know, used or whatever and still get online for free.
4385000	4387000	Because they fucked up.
4387000	4389000	So basically the whole thing just went out the window.
4389000	4396000	Yes, on the Xbox 360 at least. Still going on the Playstation 3, because they didn't forget that one.
4396000	4400000	But, Xbox 360 at least, they forgot.
4400000	4402000	Well, that's nice and fair.
4402000	4408000	And, surprisingly, the game got pretty good reviews. I didn't think it would be that well, but it did alright.
4408000	4417000	Also, From Dust on PC had that wonderful online, you have to be always online in order to play the game.
4417000	4420000	Well, now they have a patch that removes that DRM.
4420000	4424000	So, the title can be played in offline mode as well now.
4424000	4429000	I guess a follow up to that had come up a couple weeks ago.
4429000	4434000	I know that some people were pissed that an extra layer of DRM was added to the Steam version.
4434000	4436000	Not cool.
4436000	4445000	Alright, well, moving on to a story about Xbox and some bans going on on Xbox Live.
4445000	4452000	Apparently, Xbox has actually put out a statement this week that they did ban quite a few users this week.
4452000	4456000	And it was a result of, theft was the keyword they used.
4456000	4463000	The company, quote, discovered users who were illegitimately accessed Xbox Live Marketplace downloadable content.
4463000	4469000	This access was intentional and not accidental, constituting a blatant violation of the terms of use for the service.
4469000	4473000	But they won't give any more specifics about what's going on.
4473000	4479000	I guess it's known around the internet that there are some ways that you can steal the stuff and Microsoft is finally clamped down on it.
4479000	4483000	It's not entirely stealing, but yeah, there is a way.
4483000	4485000	What do you mean it's not entirely stealing?
4485000	4498000	It has to do with different profiles. People basically importing a profile over downloading that content and then, you know, it's basically recovering a profile.
4498000	4500000	Oh, it's like content sharing.
4500000	4501000	Yes.
4501000	4503000	I wonder if somebody did that when my account was hacked.
4503000	4505000	Because you know I have a lot of games.
4505000	4506000	Yeah.
4506000	4507000	So I wonder if they did that.
4507000	4515000	Basically, it's recovering a profile. So you have like people made certain profiles, say they bought like Grand Theft Auto as a games on demand thing.
4515000	4527000	And so what happens is you recover that profile and you can put it on your system and you can play offline, you know, without that profile and you know, because it's on your system.
4527000	4529000	At least I think that's how we're never tried it.
4529000	4541000	I want to say that there's got to be some type of hack that goes there because like for instance, when my one 360 red ringed and I had to get another, I put on the hard drive with all my old games on it.
4541000	4551000	And if I wasn't connected to the internet, my game would show up as a demo at first, but then it would turn into the real game after I was like signed in.
4551000	4556000	So I think something happens there where it's just the demo version, but when Xbox Live talks to it.
4556000	4561000	So I'm not sure how they're pulling that off. There's got to be something a little shady there.
4561000	4568000	I was hoping at first that this meant they caught the people that were stealing all the people's money, but I guess it doesn't sound like that.
4568000	4570000	And Microsoft still has not said anything about that.
4570000	4578000	No, they, in fact, there's a forum I browse all the time that had a section where they were swapping games like that and it's gone.
4578000	4584000	That whole forum section is no longer, which I'm guessing they just banned everybody.
4584000	4585000	Nice.
4585000	4586000	Yeah.
4586000	4590000	Alright, so this is one of those cases where you don't want to share.
4590000	4598000	Maginomicon in our chat says, I wonder if that also applies to the free Fable 2 glitch that happened a few months ago.
4598000	4601000	I seem to remember that. I don't think so.
4601000	4602000	No.
4602000	4607000	No, because that was a legitimate mistake on Microsoft's part that a lot of people went in and just took advantage of.
4607000	4610000	But at the end of the day, that was Microsoft's fault for leaving that switch open.
4610000	4614000	People weren't like hacking their consoles or going around to get it.
4614000	4617000	They had put it up on the marketplace for free.
4617000	4618000	It was kind of their own damn fault.
4618000	4622000	They were mad, but, you know, be mad at whoever did that.
4622000	4624000	Don't be mad at the people who took advantage of it.
4624000	4627000	So, alright.
4627000	4630000	Alright, moving on.
4630000	4633000	Dark Soccer, why don't you move on to the next story for us?
4633000	4635000	Yeah.
4635000	4640000	Okay, the next story actually has to do with Pinball FX.
4640000	4645000	This is the developer says that Microsoft is pretty okay in their book.
4645000	4652000	Basically, it's kind of putting down on team meat for what they said, putting down Microsoft.
4652000	4658000	And there's a quote on here from Millkirk, who is then studio's vice president of marketing.
4658000	4661000	It says, they totally have the right to talk about it.
4661000	4665000	It's terrible they had a bad experience like that, but where we're coming from, when is enough enough?
4665000	4666000	Let it go already.
4666000	4671000	So basically, they're just like, why are you trying to put them down?
4671000	4679000	We're not trying to discredit that you've had a bad time from this, but that it's time to get over it, time to move on.
4679000	4682000	And so they're apparently sniping back and forth like children.
4682000	4685000	It was interesting to read.
4685000	4690000	I don't know if the tweets are still up, but they're archived around on the internet somewhere, I'm sure.
4690000	4699000	And it was really one of those cases where I read it and I went, really? Like people don't think more about the fact that everybody is watching these two companies fight?
4699000	4702000	It wasn't very flattering for either one, I think.
4702000	4707000	But there was obviously a lot of very, it's like anybody who fights on Twitter or on Facebook or whatever.
4707000	4712000	It's just emotions are running high, so you don't think before you click post and then later you sort of regret it.
4712000	4722000	But it was nice to see that it all ended with a, you know, how about a super meat boy skin for pinball or whatever they had said at the end that they kissed, made up, cuddled.
4722000	4732000	Well, yeah, well, it's even says on here that, you know, they're like good for them, they had a good time, you know, that's great for them.
4732000	4734000	Right.
4734000	4736000	I mean, that's what the meat boy people said.
4736000	4737000	Mm hmm.
4737000	4738000	So, I mean, it's working out in the end.
4738000	4742000	But you should have seen the tweets because the tweets were the equivalent of fuck you, you fucking fuck.
4742000	4744000	Like, that's really how they read to me.
4744000	4746000	Oh, like I said, children.
4746000	4747000	Yeah.
4747000	4751000	So, but it's like someone smacked them on the hand and said, now make nice.
4751000	4755000	Well, those are, well, this is the internet, you guys look dumb right now.
4755000	4757000	Well, and they're two great games too.
4757000	4758000	Yeah.
4758000	4760000	I love both those games, pinball FX2 and meat boys.
4760000	4761000	It was kind of sad.
4761000	4764000	It's like watching your friends fight and you're just sitting there helpless.
4764000	4765000	You can't do anything about it.
4765000	4766000	You know what I mean?
4766000	4767000	I know how that feels.
4767000	4768000	I know.
4768000	4769000	There you go.
4769000	4770000	Alright, let's move on.
4770000	4772000	Travel the world and check out some release dates.
4772000	4775000	What is coming out to a console near you?
4775000	4777000	Loki, let's start in the US.
4777000	4781000	The US is actually, well, it's still continuing on with quite a few games coming out.
4781000	4789000	Starting on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, we have NHL 12 coming from EA.
4789000	4794000	Also this week, was it from Twisted Pixel?
4794000	4797000	The Gun Stringer for Kinect.
4797000	4802000	And of course you get, was it Fruit Ninja Kinect in there as well.
4802000	4807000	So if you're interested in those games, that's this week.
4807000	4810000	White Knight Chronicles 2 is coming out this week as well.
4810000	4813000	That also includes the first game that's on Playstation 3.
4813000	4818000	Camping Mama, Outdoors Adventure on Nintendo DS.
4818000	4823000	Yes, she is still making games about different things other than cooking.
4823000	4825000	New Cooking Mama coming out later this year.
4825000	4828000	Thor, God of Thunder on the 3DS.
4828000	4832000	It was basically the same version as the ones back in May, but now for the 3DS.
4832000	4835000	Deck of Sports Extreme coming out for the 3DS.
4835000	4839000	Bit.Trip Saga, which is the collection of all the Bit.Trip games.
4839000	4841000	That's on the 3DS this week as well.
4841000	4844000	Puzzler Mind Gym on the 3DS.
4844000	4849000	Bit.Trip Complete, which is on the Wii, and that also includes the soundtrack for the game as well.
4849000	4853000	Call of Juarez the Cartel on PC.
4853000	4858000	Red Orchestra 2, Heroes of Stalingrad on PC.
4858000	4865000	Nicktoons MLB, that's on the Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
4865000	4870000	The God of War Origins collection on PS3 coming out this week.
4870000	4874000	Pooka Power Up, that's on Nintendo DS.
4874000	4877000	Aren't Pookas the little guys in Dig Dug?
4877000	4879000	Oh, no.
4879000	4883000	Oh, Pooka P-U-C-C, I was thinking P-O-O-K-A.
4883000	4885000	Is it P-U-C-C-A?
4885000	4886000	Yeah.
4886000	4887000	That's like the candy.
4887000	4889000	Well, when I heard it, I thought Dig Dug.
4889000	4891000	Silly English language.
4891000	4900000	Emily the Strange Strangress on the Nintendo DS.
4900000	4902000	There's some Dual Packs coming out for the PSP.
4902000	4904000	I don't know what I'm aware of here.
4904000	4910000	Mega Man Dual Pack, I believe that's Mega Man Power Up Legends and Mega Man...
4910000	4913000	There is a Mega Man X game as well.
4913000	4915000	That's on PSP.
4915000	4920000	Then Monster Hunter Freedom Dual Pack, that's the two Monster Hunter Freedom games that were out on the PSP over here.
4920000	4925000	And that is it.
4925000	4929000	Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there.
4929000	4934000	On the Xbox 360 on September 15th, Dunamis 15 is coming out.
4934000	4941000	That is not a series I recognize over here, but it is an adventure game that's coming out on the 15th.
4941000	4948000	I don't think it's actually the 15th game in a series, but you do get bikini-clad anime girls as part of it.
4948000	4950000	Actually, she's wearing a little bra.
4950000	4951000	They're kind of cute.
4951000	4953000	I don't know what type of game this is.
4953000	4957000	Probably another type of sim game, but it looks like it has these mystery elements.
4957000	4960000	I need to stop trying to guess what these games are, because I'm probably getting it horrifically wrong.
4960000	4962000	But it is kind of fun to guess.
4962000	4965000	Otherwise, though, probably not a game we're going to get over here.
4965000	4967000	So that's really it on the 360 this week.
4967000	4972000	Going to the PlayStation 3, they're getting that same game, and that's really it on the PlayStation 3.
4972000	4976000	There's some more stuff coming next week, just so you guys know.
4976000	4982000	And then going to the handhelds real quick.
4982000	4985000	Trying to pull up the PSP releases here.
4985000	4988000	God Eater Burst gets a price reduction.
4988000	4995000	Otherwise, as far as new games go, there's Gekka, Rioran, Romance comes out from Idea Factory this week.
4995000	5001000	And this game, it looks like it could be based off an anime.
5001000	5002000	I'm not sure.
5002000	5005000	I just know one of these screenshots says,
5005000	5007000	Dessert, Prohibited Fruits Scenario.
5007000	5012000	So apparently, there's no no fruits in this game.
5012000	5015000	I don't really know how else to say that.
5015000	5017000	Prohibited Fruits Scenario is an awesome band name.
5017000	5018000	Right?
5018000	5021000	And on the 3DS this week, nothing.
5021000	5022000	Nothing on the 3DS.
5022000	5025000	But next week, Frogger, Loki's favorite.
5025000	5026000	So that's it.
5026000	5028000	Next week is going to pick up a little more in Japan.
5028000	5030000	But for right now, really nothing else.
5030000	5032000	Dark Sakura!
5032000	5037000	Well, in other news, this is of course coming out in the UK.
5037000	5042000	On the 13th, we have Hard Reset and Red Orchestra, Heroes of Stalingrad.
5042000	5049000	And on the 14th, we have From Dust, Radiant Silvergun for Xbox Live Arcade, Renegade Ops, TrackMania 2.
5049000	5052000	And on the 15th, Moto Heroes.
5052000	5054000	Alrighty.
5054000	5055000	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
5055000	5058000	Then we got the classic game of the week.
5058000	5059000	But first, Loki.
5059000	5060000	Yes.
5060000	5066000	Infinity Ward is going to get their day in court next year in May on the 7th.
5066000	5073000	This is, of course, the whole trial where they were suing Activision for royalties unpaid.
5073000	5078000	They're seeking $125 million in unpaid royalties from the sales of Modern Warfare 2.
5078000	5083000	And also wish to reclaim their contractual rights to the Modern Warfare brand.
5083000	5086000	Can you imagine if they win that?
5086000	5089000	That's going to be some interesting shit right there.
5089000	5090000	I don't think they're going to.
5090000	5092000	I'm excited one of these is finally going to court.
5092000	5095000	Like, we always hear settle, settle, settle, settle, settle.
5095000	5098000	But like now, oh man, Michael Jackson popcorn eating gift.
5098000	5100000	You know which one I'm talking about, right?
5100000	5101000	You've seen that animated file.
5101000	5103000	That's going to be me while this thing's in the courtroom.
5103000	5110000	Because even though this isn't a series I'm a big huge fan of, I'm, I'm, I'm excited to see somebody do battle with Activision.
5110000	5112000	It's going to be interesting.
5112000	5113000	Any bets?
5113000	5115000	I don't think there's bets on the court.
5115000	5116000	I don't think they're going to get.
5116000	5118000	They probably will get their royalties.
5118000	5120000	I don't know if they're going to get the Modern Warfare 2 stuff.
5120000	5123000	And even if they did, they just renamed the damn franchise.
5123000	5124000	Right.
5124000	5125000	I don't think they're going to get the same thing though.
5125000	5127000	Call of Heroes.
5127000	5128000	No, they'll still be Call of Duty.
5128000	5131000	It'll just be, you know.
5131000	5136000	Modernized Warness or something.
5136000	5138000	Warfare Modern.
5138000	5140000	Exactly.
5140000	5143000	Well, Sony created a new job this week.
5143000	5153000	They hired a chief information security officer, which probably makes sense considering, oh, you know, they had that huge information breach earlier this year when their system got hacked.
5153000	5156000	Well, they're not fucking around with who they've hired for the position.
5156000	5160000	They have hired a former US Homeland Security official.
5160000	5165000	It's Phillip Teitinger is the new chief information security officer at PlayStation Network.
5165000	5168000	No word as to exactly what that person does.
5168000	5173000	However, what I'm assuming is that he's going to make sure that system never gets hacked again.
5173000	5177000	Because if it does get hacked again, they'll probably hire someone new instead.
5177000	5179000	So, yep.
5179000	5183000	Apparently, he's not just that, but he's also going to be a senior vice president.
5183000	5188000	So, I imagine he'll have a say in some of the higher level goings ons of the companies.
5188000	5192000	He will be reporting to an executive VP in the company.
5192000	5206000	And, of course, Sony is making no really hold backs saying that they are confirming that it's because of the PSN breach saying, quote, we are looking to bolster our network security even further.
5206000	5210000	So, they are going to make sure that doesn't happen again.
5210000	5214000	Because if it does happen again, it's going to be really, really bad for everybody.
5214000	5220000	Alright, let's go back to a simpler time when the systems weren't being hacked.
5220000	5223000	And our credit card information wasn't saved on the console.
5223000	5227000	Remember when we had consoles and we didn't have to put our credit cards right on?
5227000	5231000	Remember when your consoles didn't have the memory capacity to save anything?
5231000	5232000	Exactly.
5232000	5237000	Well, I think this week's classic game did have a memory capacity of some sort.
5237000	5239000	But not on the console.
5239000	5241000	It was about 16 blocks big. That was it.
5241000	5242000	Yeah.
5242000	5245000	So, let's take a trip down memory lane with a segment we always do.
5245000	5247000	The classic game of the week.
5247000	5256000	Dark Soccer is going to dive into the gaming vault head first and pull out a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be re-experiencing this game all over again.
5256000	5264000	I got to say, this week is kind of one of those weeks where you go, really? Dark Soccer has been doing this for about 150 weeks and she never did this game?
5264000	5269000	Kind of on purpose, but this morning's conversation over breakfast really inspired.
5269000	5273000	So, what is the classic game of the week that surprisingly has never come up before?
5273000	5276000	It's Final Fantasy VII.
5276000	5286000	Final Fantasy VII came out, well, it started development in 1994 and it was supposed to be on the SNES and then to the Nintendo 64.
5286000	5294000	But when PlayStation came out, they hopped right on it because the Nintendo 64 couldn't handle the storage.
5294000	5301000	It was designed and produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi and the music was by Uematsu, which we all know.
5301000	5305000	But this is the first one that Yoshitaka Amano didn't do the character designs for.
5305000	5309000	It was done by Tetsuya Nomura.
5309000	5314000	So, this is one of my favorite games of all time for the record, I would say.
5314000	5323000	So basically, you're this emo boy named Cloud with his hair in his face and he goes around being pissed off and not so talkative.
5323000	5331000	And he runs into this whole bag named Aerith and this really cute girl named Tifa, who's really sweet and nice.
5331000	5338000	And then kind of a vampire-y dude named Vincent who you find in a coffin.
5338000	5342000	Well, my team freaking had Vincent all the damn time.
5342000	5346000	And Yuffie? Yuffie was fun and she had the Conformer?
5346000	5351000	Can I for real say the first time I played through this game, I never got Vincent.
5351000	5355000	I didn't even know he was in the game because the internet wasn't really around the back then.
5355000	5357000	I mean, it was, but nobody used it like they do now.
5357000	5366000	You know, and it's, I didn't have Vincent and I had Aerith in my party as one of my main people that I would constantly use.
5366000	5369000	So let's just say I wasn't happy by the time this two rolled around.
5369000	5373000	I was legit, like I wasn't sad, I was fucking mad.
5373000	5376000	I have my save file still where she dies.
5376000	5379000	Spoiler, she gets ganked by Sephiroth. Ew.
5379000	5382000	I mean, a lot of people were pissed off and sad.
5382000	5386000	Look at Aerith. She's a man stealing hoe bag.
5386000	5392000	Aerith dies is kind of like the video game equivalent of Darth Vader as Luke's father.
5392000	5394000	We all fucking know.
5394000	5399000	Yeah, but at any rate, you know, it's one of my favorite games.
5399000	5402000	I bred chocobos like you would not believe.
5402000	5409000	Yeah, you can breed chocobos and you race them and if you get the black chocobo, it can run over like the, over the mountains.
5409000	5415000	You can get another one that runs over the oceans and then you can get the gold chocobo that runs over everything and then you get the airship.
5415000	5422000	And there's, you know, all the little drama, the little side stories that end up like, especially with Vincent.
5422000	5429000	You know, the whole Lucretia thing being Aerith's mom, Sephiroth's mom and a bunch of crap.
5429000	5434000	But this game has some of my favorite music in it too, Rob. You should totally play.
5434000	5440000	Sure, we'll go back from the battle sound there and check out, let's see, you marked this as your favorite song.
5440000	5442000	This is my favorite in the game.
5442000	5447000	Just a little bit of it.
5447000	5450000	This is the first Jenova battle theme.
5450000	5453000	This is like my favorite music in the whole damn game.
5453000	5456000	And then my second favorite is actually more Jenova music.
5456000	5460000	The one that basically takes the battle theme and kind of redoes it.
5460000	5461000	If you don't mind.
5461000	5462000	Sure, I'll go to that one too.
5462000	5463000	Let's see.
5463000	5465000	And then I'll keep going with.
5465000	5467000	Here we go, here's a clip.
5467000	5474000	It takes it so minimalist and then just makes it super dramatic.
5477000	5479000	Anyway, so you've got all these other characters.
5479000	5481000	You've got Barret who cusses.
5481000	5484000	And Sid who has the best line in the whole game.
5484000	5487000	Is sit down in your chair and drink your goddamn tea.
5487000	5492000	Which ended up being quoted in like AOL chats for years and years and years.
5492000	5496000	And of course there's Red13 who is a kind of a lion-y looking guy.
5496000	5500000	And CatShe which for the record that is how it's pronounced.
5500000	5502000	Because it's Celtic.
5502000	5504000	It's not Cait Sith, it's CatShe.
5504000	5506000	Just thought I'd let you know.
5506000	5507000	I'm muddying the whole internet now.
5507000	5509000	I love Cait Sith, what are you talking about?
5509000	5513000	Who ends up being like a Tarte controlling the body and everything.
5513000	5518000	And of course there's Sephiroth because Sephiroth is what you got.
5518000	5520000	And by the way the story still makes no fucking sense to this day.
5520000	5521000	Yes it does.
5521000	5525000	Okay, because basically it's like the whole Shinra, the big corporation in charge.
5525000	5528000	Is sucking the life dry out of the planet.
5528000	5531000	And they're using the energy to do genetic experiments.
5531000	5534000	And they find this alien thing that lands.
5534000	5536000	And they're using that in their experiments too.
5536000	5538000	Hence Sephiroth.
5538000	5540000	Who's fucking crazy go nuts.
5540000	5542000	So anyway.
5542000	5544000	He uh.
5544000	5547000	He decides he's gonna do what Jenova came to do.
5547000	5549000	And that's destroy every fucking thing.
5549000	5551000	And Aerith's like uh uh bitch.
5551000	5553000	Even though you know she's a hoebag.
5553000	5555000	What?
5559000	5561000	I got corrected by my husband.
5561000	5564000	Danny came in and said sit your ass down in that chair and drink your god damn tea.
5564000	5566000	Yes.
5566000	5567000	Um.
5567000	5570000	Which by the way I did do a little bit of a double take.
5570000	5572000	The first time I was playing through this game and the game said shit.
5572000	5574000	I was like they can do that in games now.
5574000	5575000	Apparently.
5575000	5576000	Welcome to the Playstation.
5576000	5577000	Right.
5577000	5579000	Um so at any rate.
5579000	5582000	For a little bit more in the development side of that.
5582000	5583000	Uh.
5583000	5585000	Basically there are a lot of people involved in this.
5585000	5587000	This is a really big deal.
5587000	5588000	Um.
5588000	5592000	It uh was designed on Power Animator and Soft Image 3D.
5592000	5594000	Which is early 3D.
5594000	5595000	Ooh.
5595000	5597000	This is before my eye kids.
5597000	5600000	You know before you could just download 3D software.
5600000	5601000	You know.
5601000	5602000	For fun.
5602000	5603000	And uh.
5603000	5604000	But they.
5604000	5606000	The story was pretty much.
5606000	5607000	Um.
5607000	5609000	Pretty much what they had in mind for the Famicom.
5609000	5612000	But they were able to develop it a lot more and bring the 3D in.
5612000	5613000	Um.
5613000	5616000	They also included um previews of other games.
5616000	5617000	Um.
5617000	5620000	Basically the demo disc was a pack in with Tobol No. 1.
5620000	5621000	In Japan.
5621000	5624000	Which Tobol No. 1 was also a good game.
5624000	5627000	And uh had previews of Bushido Blade and Saga Frontier.
5627000	5630000	And uh there were just lots of cool stuff.
5630000	5633000	There was a PC version that came out um on Windows.
5633000	5635000	But it was uh.
5635000	5636000	Really.
5636000	5639000	And when it came out for systems at the time.
5639000	5641000	It was really uh.
5641000	5642000	Requirement heavy.
5642000	5644000	It really pushed systems.
5644000	5646000	And it played really slow.
5646000	5647000	It was.
5647000	5648000	Molasses.
5648000	5649000	Um.
5649000	5652000	Although now I've found that people have done um.
5652000	5654000	Different uh.
5654000	5655000	Patches form.
5655000	5657000	Where they have the Advent Children thing.
5657000	5660000	There's a whole Advent Children remake.
5660000	5661000	Um.
5661000	5663000	Using the Final Fantasy 7 PC version.
5663000	5665000	They've reskinned.
5665000	5666000	The music.
5666000	5667000	They've done uh.
5667000	5668000	HD versions.
5668000	5669000	It's pretty crazy.
5669000	5671000	And then I saw someone actually um.
5671000	5673000	Going through and using the um.
5673000	5675000	Unreal Engine to re-render whole scenes.
5675000	5677000	And I was hoping that someone was like.
5677000	5679000	There's a fan remake project out there too.
5679000	5680000	But they haven't.
5680000	5681000	Uh.
5681000	5683000	Really put anything concrete out there.
5683000	5684000	So.
5684000	5686000	I was really disappointed with that.
5686000	5687000	But I mean.
5687000	5688000	Like.
5688000	5689000	You've heard the music.
5689000	5690000	It's fantastic.
5690000	5691000	I've got the soundtrack.
5691000	5692000	It's wonderful.
5692000	5693000	Now there's um.
5693000	5695000	A few things about this game.
5695000	5696000	That.
5696000	5697000	I got an old.
5697000	5698000	I have a strategy guide.
5698000	5700000	That was based off the Japanese version.
5700000	5703000	So I really wanted to play the Japanese version for a while.
5703000	5705000	And so I finally got to borrow my friends.
5705000	5706000	And there's this little thing.
5706000	5708000	I was telling you about it this morning Rob.
5708000	5710000	These little things called Test Zero.
5710000	5712000	That look like blocky Dobermans.
5712000	5715000	And if you go into the gold saucer in the prison.
5715000	5716000	And go in the well.
5716000	5717000	They hide out in the well.
5717000	5718000	There's three of them.
5718000	5719000	It's a random encounter.
5719000	5720000	And if you keep attacking them.
5720000	5722000	And attacking and attacking and attacking and attacking.
5722000	5723000	Um.
5723000	5724000	They will uh.
5724000	5728000	They just beg for their life the whole time.
5728000	5731000	And then when you kill them you get like a million experience.
5731000	5733000	So you can like power level.
5733000	5734000	But it's not in the US one.
5734000	5735000	I tried.
5735000	5736000	Not in the US one.
5736000	5737000	Um.
5737000	5738000	There were.
5738000	5739000	Safe.
5739000	5740000	There were.
5740000	5741000	This was in the days of Dex files.
5741000	5742000	You know.
5742000	5743000	When you could download.
5743000	5744000	When you had the Dex drives.
5744000	5745000	You could download the uh.
5745000	5747000	Memory card data.
5747000	5748000	Is uh.
5748000	5749000	I got.
5749000	5750000	I always got the Tifa date.
5750000	5751000	Because I hated Aerith.
5751000	5754000	But I downloaded like a safe file that had all the other dates.
5754000	5756000	You could do a date with Aerith.
5756000	5757000	The ho-bag.
5757000	5758000	You could do a date with Barret.
5758000	5760000	And a date with Yuffie.
5760000	5761000	Which.
5761000	5762000	The Barret date was just.
5762000	5763000	Funny.
5763000	5764000	Total bromance.
5764000	5765000	Anyway.
5765000	5766000	Um.
5766000	5769000	And you play the whole game to find out the clouds fucking nuts.
5769000	5771000	And Sephiroth is even crazier.
5771000	5772000	And uh.
5772000	5773000	Aerith is dead.
5773000	5775000	Which is the best part of the game.
5775000	5776000	Um.
5776000	5777000	But yeah.
5777000	5781000	There's been rumors of Squeenix doing a remake.
5781000	5782000	And they said they would.
5782000	5785000	There's people who said they would love to dedicate the time to it.
5785000	5787000	To do it with the Final Fantasy 13 style.
5787000	5789000	So basically doing it in Unreal Engine.
5789000	5790000	Um.
5790000	5792000	There are other games related to the series.
5792000	5793000	There's Crisis Core.
5793000	5798000	Which is basically the tale of Zax and Chibi Cloud.
5798000	5800000	And there's uh.
5800000	5801000	George of Cerberus.
5801000	5803000	Which is a shooting game.
5803000	5807000	Well kind of first person shooter-y starring Vincent.
5807000	5811000	Which I sadly have but have not yet set down to play.
5811000	5812000	Um.
5812000	5814000	There were the phone games.
5814000	5815000	Remember?
5815000	5816000	What was it?
5816000	5817000	Um.
5817000	5818000	After Crisis?
5818000	5819000	Before Crisis.
5819000	5820000	Before Crisis.
5820000	5821000	That was it.
5821000	5822000	Yeah.
5822000	5823000	Um.
5823000	5824000	It was Before Crisis.
5824000	5825000	Um.
5825000	5826000	And then there's any.
5826000	5827000	There's you know.
5827000	5828000	The Advent Children Complete.
5828000	5829000	The DVD thing.
5829000	5830000	Which is awesome.
5830000	5835000	Actually the ending song has a cameo by Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance.
5835000	5836000	Just wanted.
5836000	5837000	Only in the Japanese version.
5837000	5838000	Which is stupid.
5838000	5839000	But anyway.
5839000	5840000	Um.
5840000	5841000	Just one of the best games ever.
5841000	5842000	And of course.
5842000	5843000	Um.
5843000	5846000	Amano went back and did a lot of special art.
5846000	5847000	Um.
5847000	5849000	As promotional material for Final Fantasy 7.
5849000	5851000	So uh.
5851000	5852000	I.
5852000	5853000	I.
5853000	5856000	The only ones that I have of those are what's in my huge mungus Amano art book.
5856000	5857000	Um.
5857000	5858000	But you can find them online.
5858000	5859000	They're out there.
5859000	5861000	And so that's Final Fantasy 7.
5861000	5862000	It's considered.
5862000	5863000	I mean.
5863000	5867000	I think 6 was a more solid game.
5867000	5870000	But 7 is what sits on.
5870000	5871000	I.
5871000	5872000	I.
5872000	5873000	I'll put it this way.
5873000	5877000	I owned two games before I even had a Playstation that I could say was mine.
5877000	5880000	One of them was Final Fantasy 7 and the other one was um.
5880000	5882000	A Dragon Ball GT Final Bout.
5882000	5884000	Which I wish I'd kept on.
5884000	5888000	Held onto because it was worth money and I traded it for uh.
5888000	5889000	What's that?
5889000	5892000	Blue Stinger on Dreamcast for the Japanese version.
5892000	5894000	But that's it.
5894000	5896000	Those are the two games I owned.
5896000	5897000	Alright.
5897000	5898000	There it is.
5898000	5901000	Your classic game of the week everybody.
5901000	5903000	Final Fantasy 7.
5903000	5908000	As we listen to Dark Soccer and Dan have a fight about what they did and they didn't
5908000	5909000	own.
5909000	5910000	Anyhow.
5910000	5911000	Uh.
5911000	5913000	That's gonna do it for part A of Orange Lawn Studio.
5913000	5914000	But don't go anywhere you guys.
5914000	5917000	We're gonna come back for more of Orange Lawn Studio with part B.
5917000	5918000	Where we're gonna talk about uh.
5918000	5923000	One internet service provider might be throttling your bandwidth when it comes to games.
5923000	5926000	Also we're gonna talk about some possible serious problems with the Wii U.
5926000	5928000	It might not really work.
5928000	5929000	Oh shit.
5929000	5930000	And of course rapid fire news.
5930000	5932000	Your tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r.
5932000	5936000	Your emails at mailbagatorangelawnsradio.com and your calls on the skype line.
5936000	5938000	All when we come back with more of Orange Lawn Studio.
5938000	5939000	But before we go to our break tonight.
5939000	5943000	I gotta say I believe Irene unfortunately is going to be leaving us.
5943000	5947000	Um. Because uh. She's uh. Got like homework and like real world stuff.
5947000	5948000	Mhm.
5948000	5949000	Geez.
5949000	5951000	But uh. Thanks for sitting in on the show.
5951000	5952000	I'm sorry you didn't get to talk too much.
5952000	5953000	But.
5953000	5954000	That's okay. I talked enough.
5954000	5955000	It's. It's nice to hear from you.
5955000	5956000	Don't be a stranger.
5956000	5957000	Sure.
5957000	5960000	Is there any uh. Parting words you want to say to our listeners tonight?
5960000	5962000	Not really. No.
5962000	5963000	Okay. Well then get out.
5963000	5964000	Bye.
5964000	5965000	I'm just kidding.
5965000	5966000	Well thanks for being here.
5966000	5968000	And uh. Maybe we'll hear you at least if not on OLR in the future.
5968000	5970000	Maybe a future episode of Hoard House.
5970000	5974000	Or somewhere in the Orange Lounge Radio family of programming.
5974000	5975000	Indeed.
5975000	5976000	Alright.
5976000	5977000	Alright.
5977000	5978000	Alright. So. There you go.
5978000	5979000	Uh. We're going to take a break guys.
5979000	5980000	But don't go anywhere.
5980000	5983000	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5989000	5991000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5991000	5993000	We are live on this Sunday evening.
5993000	5995000	September the 11th of 2011.
5995000	5999000	With the 427th episode of our show.
5999000	6001000	And we just had a fun Part A there.
6001000	6004000	Acknowledging the fact that it is Loki's birthday today.
6004000	6005000	And if you missed that in Part A.
6005000	6007000	Uh. Irene showed up tonight.
6007000	6008000	She's left sadly.
6008000	6010000	But uh. She brought Loki some bacon.
6010000	6012000	Well they're not. They're bacon cupcakes.
6012000	6013000	But basically she's.
6013000	6014000	Bacon garnished.
6014000	6015000	Bacon garnished cupcakes.
6015000	6017000	Like there's not bacon inside the cupcakes.
6017000	6019000	But it is pretty good I guess.
6019000	6021000	We finally dived into him during the break and ate them.
6021000	6023000	We have a present in here now.
6023000	6024000	So there you go.
6024000	6026000	Dan the man is here in studio joining us.
6026000	6027000	What have you been playing lately Dan?
6027000	6029000	Dan of course. Dark Soccer's husband.
6029000	6030000	What have you been up to?
6031000	6032000	I'm working.
6032000	6034000	You're working? You're not playing games?
6034000	6035000	I haven't got to play many games.
6035000	6036000	What is up with that?
6036000	6038000	Everybody's been saying that tonight.
6038000	6040000	I've been working too much to play games.
6040000	6041000	I understand though.
6041000	6044000	I know you just recently started employment again.
6044000	6045000	And all that good stuff so.
6045000	6046000	But that's good. That's a good thing.
6046000	6049000	I did just pick up a copy of Left 4 Dead 2.
6049000	6050000	Yeah.
6050000	6052000	But I'm like too cheap to pay for Xbox Live.
6052000	6055000	After getting it for free for the last six years.
6055000	6056000	Right.
6056000	6058000	And I'm kind of like oh man.
6058000	6060000	Three months is 25 bucks?
6060000	6062000	Screw Xbox Live.
6062000	6064000	Why didn't you guys go over to PlayStation 3 then?
6064000	6067000	Because none of the people I play games with have a PlayStation 3.
6067000	6069000	You know I um.
6069000	6072000	I apologize. I forget who said this in chat.
6072000	6074000	It's just a question that came up and it scrolled by.
6074000	6076000	But it was while Dark Soccer was doing the classic game of the week.
6076000	6077000	So I couldn't bring it up.
6077000	6080000	But to summarize the question was.
6080000	6082000	If a game is available on multiple platforms.
6082000	6086000	Including PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
6086000	6090000	What goes into your decision to decide what console you get the game on?
6090000	6092000	And for me.
6092000	6095000	Certainly price weighs into it and bonus features and things of that sort.
6095000	6099000	But it's really about like where are my friends playing?
6099000	6103000	And most of the time if it's online they're probably on Xbox Live.
6103000	6107000	But there have been games that I've bought on PlayStation 3 for the simple fact.
6107000	6110000	I am not going to use the fucking Xbox controller to play this game.
6110000	6113000	My decision for playing some of these is who can I borrow it from?
6115000	6118000	I'm kind of the opposite. I like the 360 controller.
6118000	6120000	Really? Aw. But for some games I can't stand it.
6120000	6124000	Like Super Street Fighter 4. I bought it on the PlayStation 3 simply because.
6124000	6126000	Can't fucking stand the Xbox 360 controller for fighters.
6126000	6128000	That's why God made arcade sticks.
6128000	6130000	Yeah but I don't want to buy an arcade stick.
6130000	6131000	Yes you do.
6131000	6132000	I kind of do. You're right.
6132000	6134000	Told ya.
6134000	6137000	There are some games I would like to play with an arcade joystick.
6137000	6140000	Alright so Left 4 Dead 2. I'm going to get back into that.
6140000	6141000	I guess you've got some friends.
6141000	6144000	I've never really started on that. I played like the demo.
6144000	6147000	I've liked both Left 4 Deads and I was always like.
6147000	6150000	Yeah it's like a first person shooter.
6150000	6153000	Seems like it might be kind of cool if I was playing with other people.
6153000	6155000	But it's no fun to play by yourself.
6155000	6159000	I've watched Salacious Pop play a little bit of that and it looks interesting.
6159000	6162000	But I tried to play it and I am fucking terrible at it.
6162000	6166000	It's easy to find more people that have it in the system link.
6166000	6169000	It's such a team based game. I just bring the team down.
6169000	6173000	Well the problem is one of the people we're going to play with is in Washington.
6173000	6177000	We don't have that long of an ethernet cable.
6177000	6181000	If anyone has an 800 mile ethernet cable, hook it up.
6181000	6184000	Actually X-Link Kai. You can do that.
6184000	6186000	That's system link over the internet.
6186000	6188000	Oh yeah like the game spy tunnel thing they used to do.
6188000	6189000	Yeah.
6189000	6190000	Nice.
6190000	6196000	The one component that I have a hard time defining when I would buy a game for is the PC.
6196000	6198000	Because I'm kind of like.
6198000	6200000	Oh PC games are usually pretty niche.
6200000	6203000	And a lot of times the games I buy on the PC are only on the PC.
6203000	6206000	Diablo 3 would be a good example.
6206000	6209000	Although it's very likely Diablo 3 is coming to console.
6209000	6210000	I'm not going to wait for it.
6210000	6212000	I want it when it fucking comes out.
6212000	6214000	And I bought Starcraft 2 on PC.
6214000	6216000	I bought Civilization 5 on PC.
6216000	6218000	Those games only exist on PC.
6218000	6226000	The cross platform stuff, I tend to gravitate towards the console strictly because I like to curl up on the couch.
6226000	6227000	Play the game.
6227000	6230000	Like I don't know. There's just PC games has a different.
6230000	6231000	Maybe it's ridiculous. I don't know.
6231000	6236000	But just like sitting in the office chair playing my PC games is not the same to me as being on the couch.
6236000	6237000	I love Steam.
6237000	6238000	All lazy.
6238000	6244000	Yeah and Steam will occasionally have those really fucking good sales that will make me want to buy a game on it.
6244000	6245000	So.
6245000	6246000	That was broken.
6246000	6251000	But like Portal is a good example of a game I bought on PC because it was a really good fucking deal.
6251000	6253000	I prefer playing it on PC.
6253000	6256000	I mean for me it's just easier to control even with my trackball mouse.
6256000	6257000	Now that's a keyboard mouse thing right?
6257000	6258000	Yeah.
6258000	6259000	Yeah.
6259000	6265000	I play, but see I played Portal on my PC because it looked better but I used a 360 controller.
6265000	6267000	Interesting. Okay.
6267000	6270000	I tried playing it with a 360 controller and I just didn't like it.
6270000	6271000	It wasn't very intuitive to me.
6271000	6275000	Yeah I played DC Universe on the PC but I played with a controller.
6275000	6280000	Now I was, you know, I was stuck on using a controller forever like when I played Final Fantasy XI.
6280000	6281000	I used a controller.
6281000	6284000	I had all my macros queued to my trigger buttons and everything.
6284000	6295000	And I played PSO, you know, with a controller and it wasn't until I started playing World of Warcraft that I started playing keyboard and mouse.
6295000	6301000	Something that came up on this week's Hoard House, Plug Plug, the show I do all about, all things World of Warcraft at www.hoardhouse.com.
6301000	6303000	Never too seriously though with Extifer.
6303000	6307000	One of the things he brought up this week was that his brother in law likes to play World of Warcraft.
6307000	6309000	I guess something he's been getting into on a PS3 controller.
6309000	6311000	And like it actually kind of works.
6311000	6317000	And the way it, it's very similar to how Final Fantasy XI played on the PlayStation 2 controller where you have to kind of macro things to buttons.
6317000	6318000	But it actually kind of works.
6318000	6320000	He was doing quests with them and everything.
6320000	6324000	I guess the only thing that gets a little wonky I think he said was the camera gets a little weird.
6324000	6325000	I can see that.
6325000	6326000	But I found that to be very interesting.
6326000	6331000	But you know if he's fast enough with macro attacks I bet using a controller would make it really good for PvP.
6331000	6333000	Yeah. Could be very interesting.
6333000	6336000	Because I can't do PvP because I can't mouse turn with my mouse.
6336000	6340000	I just do hide in the corner while everyone else does PvP.
6340000	6343000	That's why the big battlegrounds are fun.
6343000	6345000	Yeah that's why. I like the big battlegrounds.
6345000	6351000	Yeah so I guess it's really just a number of factors that go into the decision.
6351000	6354000	I can't like sit here and say, oh I would always go PS3.
6354000	6355000	Because I don't.
6355000	6357000	It just kind of, where's everyone else going to be?
6357000	6359000	What kind of game is it?
6359000	6361000	Where am I going to be playing it the most?
6361000	6362000	All those things kind of weigh into it.
6362000	6366000	For me I really just prefer almost anything on Xbox 360.
6366000	6373000	The controller feels pretty comfortable to my hand because I have to have a slightly wider reach on the PS3.
6373000	6378000	And the way that the little parts that stick out sit on my hand is because of my surgery really.
6378000	6380000	So it's hard for me.
6380000	6381000	I will say this.
6381000	6383000	I'm glad I have the choice.
6383000	6387000	And I realize not everyone invests in the 360 and the PS3.
6387000	6391000	And a high end PC capable of running today's games.
6391000	6393000	I realize not everybody can juggle all those things.
6393000	6400000	But you know I like that I'm fortunate enough where I have been able to have all those so I can make the decision.
6400000	6405000	For the record I just got completely light headed once the sugar hit my brain.
6405000	6406000	From those cupcakes.
6406000	6407000	I know.
6407000	6408000	Good times.
6408000	6409000	And my stomach aches.
6409000	6411000	The butter and the buttercream is kind of making me feel sick.
6411000	6412000	I only ate one.
6412000	6413000	I'm eating it anyways.
6413000	6416000	I had a frappuccino on the way in here and that was enough sugar so I didn't need it.
6416000	6420000	We'll get you the other lid for that other container.
6420000	6423000	You guys all know how I feel about pumpkin and pumpkin spice frappuccinos are back.
6423000	6425000	I want a pumpkin spice muffin right the hell now.
6425000	6428000	No I've been wanting one since breakfast.
6428000	6429000	So.
6429000	6432000	You better go now before all the Starbucks close.
6432000	6433000	So tomorrow.
6433000	6434000	You know what?
6434000	6436000	They should have had pumpkin at um.
6436000	6439000	No because I didn't like the pumpkin at Pinkberry.
6439000	6441000	Oh I love the pumpkin at Pinkberry.
6441000	6442000	It was good.
6442000	6443000	It wasn't as good.
6443000	6444000	Anyway.
6444000	6445000	Yeah.
6445000	6447000	Let's get into rapid fire news.
6447000	6448000	Back to gaming news.
6448000	6451000	A lot of quick stories we want to talk about with you guys.
6451000	6454000	Before we get to some of the other stuff.
6454000	6456000	Loki start us off.
6456000	6459000	Just like they did with the Resident Evil series.
6459000	6464000	They're going to be bringing HD remakes of Devil May Cry 1, 2, and 3.
6464000	6467000	To the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.
6467000	6470000	And this is coming to us from an ESRB leak.
6470000	6471000	Or well.
6471000	6473000	A rating I guess.
6473000	6475000	It leaked out that they were putting that stuff out.
6475000	6476000	But.
6476000	6479000	It's been rated for all three games.
6479000	6480000	On um.
6480000	6481000	On the consoles.
6481000	6482000	So.
6482000	6483000	Uh.
6483000	6485000	Very interesting that those will be coming out.
6485000	6486000	And uh.
6486000	6487000	They're kind of the trend lately.
6487000	6490000	Just do some HD remakes and.
6490000	6492000	Pop them up on there and people will buy them.
6492000	6493000	So.
6493000	6495000	Look for an announcement I'm sure.
6495000	6497000	Soon.
6497000	6498000	Um.
6498000	6500000	And the kind that go along with that.
6500000	6501000	Crisis.
6501000	6505000	Rumor to be coming to the new consoles.
6505000	6506000	Um.
6506000	6508000	Now has um.
6508000	6513000	I guess it's going to be coming to the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this October.
6513000	6516000	Also coming I believe from a leak as well.
6516000	6517000	Um.
6517000	6520000	And of course these games are going to be remastered.
6520000	6523000	They're going to be also available in 3D.
6523000	6524000	And they're.
6524000	6528000	They announced that they're going to be 1600 Microsoft points or 1999.
6528000	6529000	Um.
6529000	6530000	So that's kind of cool.
6530000	6531000	And those will be coming soon.
6531000	6534000	And the original crisis was a really good game.
6534000	6535000	Just.
6535000	6539000	I couldn't finish mine on the PC because.
6539000	6540000	Well.
6540000	6542000	It wouldn't let me.
6542000	6544000	Bad glitches.
6544000	6546000	And then last but not least.
6546000	6548000	There's this trend.
6548000	6550000	I wouldn't say it's a.
6550000	6551000	Big trend.
6551000	6552000	But uh.
6552000	6554000	Something that they call swatting.
6554000	6555000	It's a griefing trend.
6555000	6559000	Basically one of the Xbox Live mods.
6559000	6561000	I had this happen to him.
6561000	6566000	Swatting is where somebody basically calls up the FBI or tips off you know the police
6566000	6568000	or whatever that.
6568000	6571000	A certain person that you say may want to grief.
6571000	6576000	Has you know bombs or hostages or whatever in their house.
6576000	6580000	And of course since police have to take things like that seriously.
6580000	6584000	They go and storm the guys house and.
6584000	6585000	What not.
6585000	6586000	Um.
6586000	6589000	So yeah apparently this guy had it happened and.
6589000	6590000	They.
6590000	6594000	The police chief believes that the griefers hacked into a nine one one text messaging
6594000	6596000	service to pull off.
6596000	6597000	Um.
6597000	6598000	The griefing.
6598000	6602000	So they're all we have officers respond in lights and sirens.
6602000	6606000	To call they think is an emergency in progress and they get there only to find out it's a
6606000	6607000	hoax.
6607000	6609000	So apparently that's fucked up.
6609000	6612000	There's a hundred hundred documented cases.
6612000	6615000	So far the FBI is tracking so.
6615000	6619000	All the way from like Oregon to Florida.
6619000	6623000	That is so fucked up to do that like that in juvenile that better fucking come around
6623000	6627000	to bite these people in the ass because not only is it just fucked up to do to somebody
6627000	6630000	but that is such a waste of money because the police department the fire department
6630000	6632000	all that they've got to take that shit seriously you know.
6632000	6637000	And that's thousands of dollars of our money that's spent on these laws and it's not fucking
6637000	6638000	funny.
6638000	6639000	You know what I mean.
6639000	6640000	It's just sad.
6640000	6641000	Very unfortunate.
6641000	6647000	Although I'd have to ask is how the fuck do they get the guy's address.
6647000	6649000	That's a very good question.
6649000	6654000	Unfortunately probably more hacking of some sort or could it be as simple as the guys
6654000	6655000	in the yellow or the white pages.
6655000	6657000	Does that even exist anymore.
6657000	6659000	I guess there are still phone books.
6659000	6663000	Yeah they they drop a phone book off at my doorstep every once in a while.
6663000	6666000	This is a big advertisement for all the companies so you know what.
6666000	6669000	The day and age that we live in right now with the Internet I just throw that shit in
6669000	6670000	the garbage.
6670000	6671000	The phone book's a waste of money.
6671000	6672000	It's unfortunate.
6672000	6673000	Anyhow.
6673000	6675000	Moving on to some more news.
6675000	6677000	The Sim social we mentioned earlier.
6677000	6682000	It is currently a more active game than Farmville on Facebook.
6682000	6687000	So Sim social is now actually surpassed Farmville in the amount of daily active users.
6687000	6693000	The Sim social is seeing an average of nine point three million active users per day.
6693000	6697000	They play on the average three times a day in 15 to 20 minute increments.
6697000	6699000	Of course if you're dark soccer that's backwards.
6699000	6703000	She plays 15 to 20 times a day in three minute increments.
6703000	6704000	Just kidding.
6704000	6705000	That's pretty true.
6705000	6707000	Okay I'm not kidding.
6707000	6711000	Anyhow Farmville still has eight point one million people but the most popular game on
6711000	6712000	Facebook right now.
6712000	6714000	Cityville also by Zynga.
6714000	6717000	Thirteen point nine million users a day.
6717000	6722000	The only app that gets more traffic than that is Windows Messenger Live which is somehow
6722000	6723000	integrated into Facebook.
6723000	6725000	I've never even used that.
6725000	6726000	There you go.
6726000	6730000	So what isn't said is how much fucking wall spam has gone out because of this app.
6730000	6734000	It's one of those things I hate that I play it but I can't stop playing.
6734000	6735000	Argh.
6735000	6737000	I would block people that did that.
6737000	6741000	Here's a game that I can't be sad about enjoying because it's really fucking good.
6741000	6742000	Little Big Planet 2.
6742000	6745000	Well okay so I haven't really played the sequel like I've played the original.
6745000	6746000	But I will at some point.
6746000	6747000	It just went on sale.
6747000	6748000	I need to get it.
6748000	6751000	Little Big Planet 2 just got its move patch.
6751000	6752000	I guess it's.
6752000	6753000	I could loan it to you.
6753000	6754000	It's not.
6754000	6755000	Oh that'd be great.
6755000	6758000	It's not going live just yet until the move pack goes out.
6758000	6764000	But update 1.06 is out which does release some new censors.
6764000	6766000	Some limiting players on homebrew levels.
6766000	6769000	You can control the basic game with the move controller now.
6769000	6775000	So all that stuff is setting up to take away for the move support officially in Little
6775000	6779000	Big Planet 2 which comes with the move pack very very very soon.
6779000	6784000	Lastly if you build games a little more seriously than Little Big Planet 2.
6784000	6786000	Not to say Little Big Planet is a serious business.
6786000	6788000	But this is real serious business.
6788000	6790000	Raw source code of popular games.
6790000	6791000	How popular?
6791000	6795000	Wolfenstein 3D Platinum and Doom Classic.
6795000	6796000	Don't worry guys.
6796000	6797000	This is legit.
6797000	6800000	ID Software actually released the source codes themselves.
6800000	6803000	You can go get the source codes for these games.
6803000	6805000	And there you go.
6805000	6808000	It's update 2.1.
6808000	6812000	And you can go grab the source code and tinker away at that.
6812000	6815000	I'd be excited to see what kind of games come out of that.
6815000	6819000	I think the Wolfenstein code had been released before and this is some type of upgrade.
6819000	6821000	But there you go.
6821000	6822000	Moving on Dark Soccer.
6822000	6823000	What do you have for us?
6823000	6825000	How about some DJ Max Technica?
6825000	6827000	I know that you like that game right?
6827000	6828000	I do.
6828000	6829000	The arcade game is pretty awesome.
6829000	6831000	What's coming to the Vita?
6831000	6833000	It's going to be.
6833000	6837000	Yeah it's actually DJ Max Technica going to be out on the Vita.
6837000	6841000	There is not a date yet but they say it looks like it's going to be really hard.
6841000	6844000	And that it's going to use both the touch screen and the rear touch panel.
6844000	6845000	So who knows?
6845000	6849000	That makes a lot of sense considering that you know when I heard about this I was like
6849000	6852000	oh yeah cause the game is basically on a giant touch screen.
6852000	6853000	It's basically Elite Beat Agents.
6853000	6855000	Yeah.
6855000	6857000	And then other news.
6857000	6866000	Microsoft says 42% of US Xbox Live Gold members watch an average of an hour of video content a day.
6866000	6870000	And that's including Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Zune on Xbox 360.
6870000	6876000	So it looks like there are going to be quite a bit more going on.
6876000	6881000	In fact it was reported by Terry Farrell, not to be confused with the lady that played Judzia Dax.
6881000	6887000	Who is the Senior Product Manager of Xbox Live Entertainment.
6887000	6889000	This report comes from him.
6889000	6894000	So they're going to definitely be working to up that in the fall dashboard update.
6894000	6898000	And then sad, sad, sad news.
6898000	6903000	Game writing pioneer Bill Kunkel passed away.
6903000	6904000	Very sad.
6904000	6906000	He died on September 4th.
6906000	6908000	He was the Game Doctor.
6908000	6910000	Does that sound familiar to anybody?
6910000	6914000	I totally remember the Game Doctor columns from the old magazines from back in the...
6914000	6916000	Oh god that was like the 80s.
6916000	6917000	Computer Gaming World.
6917000	6919000	Video Game Computer Entertainment, right?
6919000	6920000	Yep.
6920000	6925000	And the original Electronic Games, not to be confused with Electronic Gaming Monthly.
6925000	6926000	Yeah.
6926000	6927000	Oh yeah.
6927000	6928000	The Commodore 64 magazines.
6928000	6929000	We had them all.
6929000	6930000	That and the Commodore 64 magazines.
6930000	6932000	But Bill wasn't a part of those.
6932000	6933000	I don't think.
6933000	6936000	Well he was 61 years old.
6936000	6940000	And he'd been working on video game columns since 1978.
6940000	6943000	And he co-founded EGM.
6943000	6946000	Wow.
6946000	6948000	He will be missed.
6948000	6952000	As I understand it, he was working right up until the unfortunate...
6952000	6954000	Because the death was unexpected as I hear.
6954000	6958000	So he was still doing some work on websites and so forth.
6958000	6960000	So it's surprising.
6960000	6961000	It's very unfortunate.
6961000	6963000	I'm pulling up a list of other things that he worked on.
6963000	6967000	Because he said he also did stuff for DC and Marvel.
6967000	6977000	Actually also worked with KKWD, Fogg Studios, Metropolis Media.
6977000	6978000	Busy guy.
6978000	6979000	Lots of stuff.
6979000	6984000	And did a lot of the strategy guides for Prima.
6984000	6985000	Oh wow.
6985000	6994000	Maximo Carnage, Descent, FPS Baseball, Gex, Die Hard Trilogy, NFL Quarterback Club 98, Madden 64, and Brady.
6994000	6996000	So he was actually getting into game development at some point.
6996000	6999000	He did Madden 64 for a Brady game. Sorry.
6999000	7001000	Oh I see. Okay. Interesting.
7001000	7004000	So yeah, pretty crazy stuff.
7004000	7005000	It's too bad.
7005000	7006000	Yeah.
7006000	7007000	Too bad.
7007000	7009000	Well that's it for our quick news tonight.
7009000	7012000	So let's get back into more news.
7012000	7014000	I don't know why we have the quick news and then the long news.
7014000	7016000	But I don't know. It's just the way we've been doing it.
7016000	7018000	Whatever. Let's move on. Loki.
7018000	7030000	So you may remember that during Gamescom they announced that the PSP is going to be getting a new version out in Europe that was going to be Sans Wi-Fi.
7030000	7037000	And we're kind of wondering why they went ahead and did this seeing as the Vita is going to be coming out soon.
7037000	7040000	Well one of the things that they're trying to do is target teens.
7040000	7043000	They're saying it's all for the audience.
7043000	7049000	If we're going to take PSP very young, teens and much younger, they're happy to just play the game.
7049000	7054000	If taking Wi-Fi out is the price to pay, we're happy to do it.
7054000	7062000	And they also believe that the price point will give the console a much needed sales bump, especially during the upcoming holiday season.
7062000	7070000	And they're saying that at 99 euro it'll make a great Christmas gift.
7070000	7075000	Of course the new system is dubbed the E1000.
7075000	7087000	Honestly, if you're really looking for a PSP system, you can buy a new system for less than that with Wi-Fi.
7087000	7091000	But it's what the gamers want, Loki. It's what the 13 year old gamers want.
7091000	7094000	Wi-Fi doesn't cost that much. I mean, come on.
7094000	7101000	And you know what? Teenagers nowadays have smartphones. They have iPods, iPhones, whatnot.
7101000	7104000	Teenagers do not need a PSP. They need a school book.
7104000	7109000	I understand that, but they are connected to the internet.
7109000	7112000	It's like they're saying, well, teenagers are just happy to play the game.
7112000	7115000	Yes, some of them are just happy to play the games.
7115000	7125000	But you know what? You can still buy one of your older PSP systems and have that functionality in there for the same price, if not cheaper.
7125000	7137000	Have you heard that whole, not to deviate too much from the story, but have you heard that whole story about how the kids at some schools in certain districts are now, instead of getting textbooks, they get iPads with the books on them?
7137000	7142000	Because, believe it or not, a $600 iPad or whatever, well, what's the lowest one cost? Maybe $400?
7142000	7147000	Those iPads are cheaper than some of the textbooks for all those classes combined.
7147000	7150000	It's like the iPad is becoming a cheaper alternative. It's crazy.
7150000	7151000	To the textbooks.
7151000	7162000	Yep. How about this? How about instead of spending $500 on an iPad, which granted is a good piece of technology, but how about you spend it on a cheaper e-reader and you can put those books on there?
7162000	7166000	Dude, you can get HP touch pads for $100. They should have got in on that deal.
7166000	7175000	I mean, if it's reading just books, that's all it's doing, I think there's cheaper alternatives out there than just that.
7175000	7190000	Or, here's an idea, pretty much everybody, you know, nowadays in school and stuff, and I know that there's people out there that are, you know, without a substantial income, but you gotta admit, most people probably have a PC at home.
7190000	7191000	Right.
7191000	7200000	You know, the majority of people out there have a PC. Just give it to them in like a PDF format or something like that. I guess if you're bringing it to the school, but...
7200000	7207000	What are the authors of those books? I mean, a desktop. You could have a desktop computer at each one of these desk...
7207000	7208000	I think a lot do now.
7208000	7212000	Yes, and then just have the book on there.
7212000	7221000	Geez. Alright, going to our chatroom at chat.orangetonshade.com, taking you back to what the story was originally about before we got on that tangent, ToaGak in our chatroom says,
7221000	7236000	You want to know what my PSP is used for? 99% WiFi, 1% games. You know, I've heard that a lot. Not so much the teenage crowd, but the college crowd really loves that the PSP is a web browser, an MP3 player, and it happens to play games.
7236000	7244000	And I've said this a million times on the show before. I'm starting to sound like a broken record. The PSP's biggest strength was always the fact that it didn't just do games.
7244000	7249000	It did, well, like their little tagline, it only does everything, and that really is Sony's strength.
7249000	7252000	It's not going to do much, though, when it doesn't have WiFi.
7252000	7259000	Exactly. So it's like, it only does nothing, is what this system does.
7259000	7270000	I just don't understand what the point is, because it will help bump sales. I don't know about the Europe region, but in the US and North America, there's not a lot of PSP games coming out.
7270000	7273000	There's like five. Five for the whole fourth quarter.
7273000	7280000	I was fascinated to go to Fry's today, as I was talking about before, and see that they are still selling the PSP movies.
7280000	7282000	You can still buy PSP movies.
7282000	7286000	Yeah, probably got them for a good deal, because no one's selling them anymore.
7286000	7288000	Five to ten bucks.
7288000	7297000	Sony was the only one for the longest time that was putting out movies on that system. The last movie I remember on the UMD format was 2012.
7297000	7305000	That's a Sony title, so obviously that makes sense why that would be on there. Well, it sort of makes sense.
7305000	7310000	Those things are dirt cheap now. They're definitely not manufacturing them anymore.
7310000	7325000	Yeah, I don't understand the point. Of course they want their system to sell well, but I think removing a pretty integral feature from the system that, once again, with the whole PSP Go and stuff,
7325000	7331000	you don't need to reinvent the system to help it sell. Why are you going to spend more money on a system that does less?
7331000	7339000	That's the whole point here. Why would I spend more money on a system that doesn't have Wi-Fi when I can use this in preferred, but you know what?
7339000	7349000	Those so-called teenagers probably don't give a shit that it's a little bit used, and it will come with games for less than that.
7349000	7357000	In fact, I think I was taking a look here. I saw some new, well, some used PSP systems on eBay.
7357000	7367000	We'll see here. They've got the Giga pack or whatever. $65 starting on those used.
7367000	7377000	Also, if you just want the PSP Slim, they have the Slim with Crysis Core, the Final Fantasy VII bundle or whatever, and silver. $89.
7377000	7383000	And I know that the Euros, that's almost one and a half times the US dollar.
7383000	7393000	I mean, shit, you can buy a new system here for $129.99, brand new. And they're region-free, so why not?
7393000	7396000	Or at this point, you might as well just wait for the Vita.
7396000	7398000	Alright, we'll get something else.
7398000	7404000	Well, moving on to a totally different topic. This is about not getting between somebody and their bandwidth.
7404000	7411000	You know, nothing gets the internet rabble-rabble more than hearing about internet service providers and their recent restrictions.
7411000	7419000	Well, this has to do with a Canadian provider, actually. It has to do with Rogers Cable and Telcom, who's Canada's largest broadband provider.
7419000	7427000	Apparently, they had some complaints from World of Warcraft players saying that the World of Warcraft traffic was being throttled.
7427000	7434000	Now, oh my gosh, that just goes double so. Do not get between, and I say this as a Warcraft player, do not get between me and my WoW.
7434000	7438000	Do not try to limit my bandwidth and lower my ping times.
7438000	7444000	And there was accusations that Rogers was apparently throttling the bandwidth and so forth.
7444000	7454000	Rogers has admitted that the game's online traffic might actually trip the monitors that kind of monitor this stuff and result in throttling.
7454000	7459000	They are calling this inadvertent, but that doesn't fix the problem.
7459000	7462000	I guess Canadian regulators have even gotten involved.
7462000	7466000	The Canadian Gamers Organization, I didn't even know that existed. That's kind of cool.
7466000	7470000	They actually filed an inquiry into the practices of this company.
7470000	7480000	So I guess what happens is because you've got the peer-to-peer traffic going on in World of Warcraft, it's being misclassified as something more nefarious.
7480000	7483000	By the way, the same thing apparently is happening in Call of Duty Black Ops.
7483000	7492000	I guess the rule is that if something is transmitting 80 kbps or more, it is what is enabling the throttling.
7492000	7498000	So, now Rogers says that the games can all run underneath that rate.
7498000	7503000	So those who are experiencing the throttling must be running some type of other application with the gaming.
7503000	7507000	But I kind of sit there and go, what about Ventrilo and some of the other stuff?
7507000	7515000	I'm notorious for playing WoW and surfing the web at the same time. Just put a renew on somebody and then go alt-tab and check my email.
7515000	7528000	Anyhow, let's see. I guess the co-founder of the Canadian Gamer Organization said,
7528000	7542000	quote, rather than fixing the issue and actively whitelisting gaming systems to ensure they are not affected, Rogers is continuing to rely on consumer input and complaints rather than put forth the active testing needed to ensure compliance with CRTC policy.
7542000	7546000	We believe this approach is inappropriate under these circumstances.
7546000	7556000	So the Canadian Gamer Organization is going to ask for a new law requiring providers like Rogers to have a formal way for customers to report complaints.
7556000	7560000	Canadians are pissed and you don't hear that very often.
7560000	7565000	Honestly, I think I would be too.
7565000	7571000	Oh yeah, you don't get between somebody and their WoW. You just don't. Call of Duty, all those people.
7571000	7577000	Especially, the shitty thing is that it is legitimate use of the internet and it's being throttled.
7577000	7587000	Like, I understand why they want to throttle bandwidth and so forth, but you know, unfortunately, legit people pay the cost of somebody else.
7587000	7592000	All the time, the common thing. Same thing we've said about DRM time and time again.
7592000	7595000	Let's get to the emails.
7595000	7599000	Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.
7599000	7603000	DarkSocker is going to dive into the email bag and pull out a few of her favorite emails.
7603000	7605000	Ew, it's so sticky!
7605000	7607000	Alright, the first one.
7607000	7611000	Hi all, just wanted to point out that you could actually surf the net on the DS.
7611000	7618000	They just didn't release the attachments in the USA. When I was in Japan, I bought it and it was one of the ones that used the GBA slot in a different way.
7618000	7626000	As for the 3DS vs Vita, well, I just got a 3DS. The PSP never appealed to me. I love the 3DS.
7626000	7633000	Although I did buy mine on eBay for $195 for 3DS games included and the Nintendo Ambassador program.
7633000	7637000	With the Vita, and by the way, it's V-I-T-A, not D-A.
7637000	7647000	It would have to pull off something really impressive because Netflix on my 3DS is awesome.
7647000	7652000	Not going to buy another system if the one I have now can do it already and that's from Holly D.
7652000	7662000	You know what, that is correct. I could have sworn we would have made that clear because I was aware that the DS had a web browser but only on the DS's that had the eShop.
7662000	7670000	And that would start with the DSi and above. However, I do remember that I did forget that Japan did have a cart.
7670000	7673000	Actually, I found one for sale at the local dimple.
7673000	7674000	The US also had a cart.
7674000	7675000	Did they really?
7675000	7681000	Yes, it came with a memory expansion slot that goes in the Game Boy Advance slot.
7681000	7683000	Well, I did forget about the browser and the cartridge.
7683000	7684000	But still terrible.
7684000	7687000	Yeah, I don't like browsing the web on the 3DS either.
7687000	7688000	It is terrible.
7688000	7690000	It's clunky, I don't know.
7690000	7692000	Well, moving forward.
7692000	7693000	Needs to be optimized. Ok.
7693000	7698000	Evening. I would have sent this last week but didn't realize you had a Labor Day weekend show.
7698000	7702000	Anyhow, I see the mobile game Flight Control is now available for WiiWare.
7702000	7708000	Fairly nice to have this one on a full display with local multiplayer, although the lack of versus is somewhat disappointing.
7708000	7716000	Also, it really puts the infamous Wii Remote jitter front and center.
7716000	7721000	Sorry, I believe last year Firemint was supposed to have a PS Move version of the game.
7721000	7723000	Did they say why this never came out in North America?
7723000	7724000	And that's from Robert M.
7724000	7726000	No, and I got to admit, I'm not very familiar with that game.
7726000	7727000	What is it called again?
7727000	7728000	Flight Control?
7728000	7729000	Hmm.
7729000	7731000	Loki, is this a game you know about?
7731000	7739000	I think Flight Control is one of those air traffic controller games where you control the different planes that are taking off and stuff.
7739000	7741000	I think they have that kind of stuff on the iPod.
7741000	7742000	It might have been a WiiWare game.
7742000	7744000	It said it was originally a mobile game.
7744000	7745000	Yeah.
7745000	7748000	I'm looking at a trailer here for the game.
7748000	7754000	I'm so visual, I need to see this here.
7754000	7755000	Oh!
7755000	7756000	See?
7756000	7759000	Once I see it, this is based on an iPad game.
7759000	7764000	This is where you draw the path of the planes and you don't want them to collide.
7764000	7767000	This is based off an iPad game.
7767000	7768000	See?
7768000	7769000	I just had to see it.
7769000	7770000	I do know this game.
7770000	7773000	I didn't know that they had ported it to anything besides the iPad.
7773000	7777000	That part's news to me.
7777000	7778000	So there you go.
7778000	7781000	Sorry, I don't know the other answer to your question.
7781000	7782000	I'm sorry.
7782000	7785000	Rob, you're going to need to pull up this email because apparently there's a YouTube link.
7785000	7786000	I'm going to copy it to you.
7786000	7788000	Yeah, just copy the YouTube link to me.
7788000	7790000	But I will read you the...
7790000	7794000	Let me just paste it to you real quick.
7794000	7796000	Live radio, kids.
7796000	7797000	It's what we're all about here.
7797000	7798000	Hey, I'm fast.
7798000	7800000	With my damn trackball.
7800000	7802000	Do I play it now or when you say?
7802000	7803000	After this.
7803000	7805000	I'll go ahead and read this.
7805000	7807000	Yo homies, Xenocore here.
7807000	7812000	I'm sad that I just discovered this song, but you must use this for Listless this Sunday.
7812000	7813000	Okay?
7813000	7814000	For Listless?
7814000	7816000	This is from the Rubber Bandits, Horse Outside.
7816000	7817000	And don't use the clean version.
7817000	7818000	This song is freaking awesome.
7818000	7820000	I think they're talking about Cage Match.
7820000	7821000	Oh, yeah.
7821000	7822000	It's probably Cage Match.
7822000	7823000	But, hey.
7823000	7830000	Don't be going fucking dumb stuff and around like one of them covers, you know?
7830000	7833000	Dudes with accents.
7833000	7839000	Let me forward a little bit here.
7839000	7843000	Yeah, I think this is something for the Cage Match segment, not the...
7843000	7844000	Veto.
7844000	7845000	That's it.
7845000	7847000	I'll check it out later.
7847000	7848000	Veto.
7848000	7849000	Not when we're live on air.
7849000	7850000	Okay.
7850000	7851000	Well, that's it.
7851000	7852000	That's it?
7852000	7853000	That's it.
7853000	7854000	We need more emails.
7854000	7857000	Well, the other one was someone trying to get us to, like, post his stuff, and I'm like,
7857000	7858000	no.
7858000	7860000	Yeah, yeah.
7860000	7861000	Orangelauntrader.com.
7861000	7862000	Free plugs.
7862000	7863000	You have to disguise for free plugs.
7863000	7864000	I'm not free.
7864000	7865000	All right.
7865000	7866000	All right.
7866000	7868000	Let's get to the part of the show where we...
7868000	7870000	It costs a lot of money to be this cheap.
7870000	7873000	Let's get to the part of the show where we get ranty.
7873000	7877000	It's the FUs of the week, and we do them here on the show because we can.
7877000	7896000	FU to finding out about emo crap during the show.
7896000	7897000	Ugh.
7897000	7898000	Loki.
7898000	7903000	Fucking my cat for being an asshole.
7903000	7904000	Um.
7904000	7905000	I don't know.
7905000	7908000	FU to the fact that this weekend was shorter than last weekend.
7908000	7910000	No, FU to the three-hour nap I took yesterday.
7910000	7914000	This is the first weekend in forever where I had literally nothing planned on Saturday.
7914000	7917000	It was amazing to just sit at home all day and veg.
7917000	7918000	But what did I do?
7918000	7921000	I napped literally the whole damn day away.
7921000	7923000	But I feel really rested, and I feel great.
7923000	7925000	So, I guess I needed it.
7925000	7928000	But FU to what felt like a wasted day.
7928000	7929000	All right.
7929000	7933000	A few more news stories for you guys, then we're gonna open it up to you guys via Twitter,
7933000	7937000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R, and our Skype line at 1877 game O-L-R.
7937000	7940000	But don't call yet, because we still have a few more stories to get through.
7940000	7942000	Yeah, Origin has been doing pretty well.
7942000	7949000	EA's new, um, kind of e-commerce site for streaming game.
7949000	7953000	Well, not really streaming games, but downloading digital games and stuff like that.
7953000	7956000	They have four million client installs.
7956000	7962000	That doesn't really translate into purchases, but it's been installed on four million computers.
7962000	7966000	They're gonna be adding third-party content very soon.
7966000	7978000	And, of course, they're saying that it will use its collection of 130 million users and various payment methods to attract third-party games to Origin.
7978000	7981000	So, wait a second.
7981000	7989000	So, what they're saying is they have four million client installs, yet 130 million users?
7989000	7991000	That doesn't really make sense to me.
7991000	7992000	Whatever.
7992000	7999000	I guess they're talking about maybe the Electronic Arts site and how they have that, like, uh...
7999000	8004000	Oh, like when you do Dragon Age and stuff? You have to sign up for their stupid online thing?
8004000	8007000	Yeah, I like how they count all those players in there.
8007000	8012000	They don't have a choice. They have to sign up on that site in order to play those games.
8012000	8019000	It's not like, oh, I love EA. I'm gonna totally register an account with them because they're awesome,
8019000	8021000	and I love their products, and I really...
8021000	8023000	You have no choice.
8023000	8026000	But I like how they skew that. That's awesome.
8026000	8038000	And then, of course, there's some information from Origin regarding a new remake of Syndicate, that series.
8038000	8045000	Apparently, it's gonna be done by the developer Starbreeze, who did Escape from Butcher Bay and The Darkness.
8045000	8053000	And I guess they're showing off some stuff. Some stuff, I guess, leaked out from their website.
8053000	8059000	Looks interesting. They're saying that the story's penned by the guy that did the Crysis 2 script,
8059000	8062000	and he also wrote some books and stuff.
8062000	8070000	Also, that it's supposed to debut next week in the Game Reactor magazine, which is a Swedish publication.
8070000	8082000	And, I don't know, it looks kinda cool. So, I guess, check out the EA Origins store if you wanna catch some details on that,
8082000	8087000	or just check out the web, because it's leaked out.
8087000	8094000	Alright. I have yet to use the Origins store, but I remember we got a call last week saying it's not that bad, you guys.
8094000	8099000	But it is interesting that it has so many installs, but isn't that because it's kind of forced on people?
8099000	8100000	I don't know.
8100000	8107000	Well, Origin, I mean, some of it's probably voluntary. Some of it was, didn't it become Origin, like it was something else,
8107000	8110000	and then it just translated over to Origin?
8110000	8116000	God, well, whenever I hear Origin, I think about the old school publishing house, or studio, that would make,
8116000	8118000	like the old Ultimate games are all Origin.
8118000	8119000	Yeah, I think that's what this is.
8119000	8123000	No. No, no, no, no. This is Steam. This is their Steam competitor.
8123000	8127000	Well, I understand that, but Origin was that company, and now it's the site.
8127000	8131000	Right, EA sucked them up, and then never used the name, and now they just brought back the name for this,
8131000	8136000	but the two uses of the name have nothing to do with each other. Does that make sense?
8136000	8138000	Oh, yeah, it makes sense.
8138000	8149000	Anyhow, Wii U, this has been some big news talking about this week, and, you know, while this reeks of being a rumor,
8149000	8154000	this is coming from that French site that's been getting a lot of smoking guns lately.
8154000	8161000	They've become quite the site to get the early gossip, because they leaked the news about the Vita, right, I think?
8161000	8165000	They leaked the news about the extra thing on the 3DS, which now we have a picture of,
8165000	8171000	and now they're talking about this, so take it with a grain of salt, but it's very interesting we're writing the Wii U.
8171000	8178000	Apparently, they're saying that Nintendo is having big problems getting the Wii U up and running.
8178000	8183000	Apparently, the Wii U is not up to wanting to do what Nintendo needs it to do.
8183000	8188000	It's not just running the console, but beaming the data to the touchscreen controller as well.
8188000	8194000	Apparently, developers that are working on the console, they use tethers to ensure that the communication,
8194000	8200000	so basically it has to do with the wireless aspect of it, and right now the developers have to use a wire to the controller
8200000	8203000	to make sure the information gets across fast enough.
8203000	8207000	Even then, apparently things aren't still working out that well.
8207000	8214000	Progress is halted daily with repeated software updates for the pad. Hmm, interesting.
8214000	8218000	Apparently, these problems are causing a delay in the console's launch.
8218000	8223000	Originally, they had been looking at June 2012, but now they're saying September 2012,
8223000	8229000	which to me, personally, I would have said, well, that was the timeframe I was thinking for the system anyways.
8229000	8231000	That doesn't seem like such a huge setback.
8231000	8238000	Now, obviously, you can't prove these allegations. Nintendo, even though the blogs are trying to get them to comment,
8238000	8241000	they're not going to. They're going to say, we don't comment on re-imagination and speculation,
8241000	8248000	but it definitely kind of says, hmm, maybe this is not going to be ready by the time it needs to roll out,
8248000	8251000	or at least it's going to be really gimped.
8251000	8256000	So I'm sure Loki's just ready to unfold on this one, right, Loki? What do you think of hearing all this?
8256000	8266000	It's still really early. I mean, I don't know. It's hard to say. I mean, it's not good.
8266000	8275000	I mean, I just don't know. I just don't know if it's really going to end up being true.
8275000	8280000	Obviously, they're not going to launch the system if it's, you know, not going to work.
8280000	8286000	If it's flat doesn't work, they're not going to launch it, but might they have to downgrade it a little bit to get it to work?
8286000	8290000	Or I guess it could go the other way around. They'd have to upgrade it to get it to work too, huh?
8290000	8296000	I'm not sure which way it goes. Do you downgrade the processing power so that way there's not as much data to transmit?
8296000	8300000	Or do you upgrade, I guess, finding the balance?
8300000	8305000	But it is interesting that the PlayStation 3 kind of does this with the PSP right now.
8305000	8309000	It's a little lag though. I mean, it wouldn't, the technology has to get a little bit better than that.
8309000	8314000	I don't know how it's going to work with the PS3 and the Vita, but you know, it's a little bit laggy.
8314000	8317000	And obviously, they don't want that on the Wii U.
8317000	8325000	So, I'm wondering though what it uses because I was just looking this up.
8325000	8334000	Just a theory here. One reason why we may be seeing the whole 3DS getting a second analog stick is maybe they're just not going to put out the controller at all.
8334000	8349000	It's just going to use the 3DS and because the 3DS has 802.11g, it's a lot more bandwidth than say, ad hoc wireless, which I'm not really sure what speed that's at, but I don't think it's as fast as wireless g.
8349000	8357000	So, if that's the case, then they'd be able to fit more data through there. Plus, it's a smaller screen. Maybe? I don't know.
8357000	8363000	Interesting comment from Imaginomicon in chat. In all fairness, Kinect had basically the same situation.
8363000	8367000	That is, it couldn't do what they initially advertised and was eventually gimped.
8367000	8372000	Weren't there early rumors about the Kinect that the Kinect couldn't see certain races and things like that?
8372000	8375000	Yeah, that's not true though.
8375000	8378000	Okay, that was just bad PR for Microsoft.
8378000	8382000	They're all, oh, I can't see black people. No, that's not true.
8382000	8384000	Well, obviously I can now, but you know.
8384000	8396000	Well, it could before. It was just like, if you're playing on, you know, it depends on where you're playing. If you're playing with something with a lot of light interference or if it's too dark or something like that.
8396000	8401000	Well, I can't play Kinect in the dark either. I mean, you gotta have some, you know, some light.
8401000	8409000	So, it was stupid because it was like, well, actually it won't detect anybody in those lighting conditions and not necessarily just people of a certain race.
8409000	8412000	So, yeah, that was just...
8412000	8421000	But I do seem to recall that it seemed like the Kinect, I want to say there was a story about how they did have to kind of change the Kinect too.
8421000	8429000	Well, I think they dropped the resolution down so they could have more bandwidth to go between the sensor and, you know, the system.
8429000	8443000	But, you know, that's just a little bit of data going back and forth via like USB, but this isn't even close to that. This is going to be like streaming video and inputs and stuff like that.
8443000	8448000	You're talking about being able to play games streaming from your console onto the...
8448000	8459000	Which, I don't understand why it's not possible. I mean, you can do it on the PSP, but you can do it on the PSP over the internet and over that 802.11g.
8459000	8468000	So, maybe like I said before, more bandwidth there and allow you to be able to do what you can't do on the console.
8468000	8472000	Although, why couldn't you make the controller connect to your WiFi network?
8472000	8480000	Hey, then you can even add it. So, hey, look, you can surf the web on this controller, but it's not going to let you do that.
8480000	8484000	All right, well, let's move on with a few more stories before we get to the Twitter topics and phone calls.
8484000	8488000	I'm expecting to hear about this and some phone calls tonight.
8488000	8489000	Dark Soccer, our next story.
8489000	8496000	Well, how about the scariest Xbox 360 game? Ooh, what do you think it would be?
8496000	8500000	Scariest Xbox 360 game? I don't know.
8500000	8510000	Well, it looks that the major vote goes for Dead Space 2. That that is considered to be the scariest game.
8510000	8526000	And this is coming just ahead of... What they did is they actually tested core and casual gamer's heart rate, sweat levels and body temperature, while playing Alan Wake, Resident Evil 5, Dead Space 2, and Condemned.
8526000	8528000	It was sad that Yaris wasn't included in there.
8528000	8533000	Well, that would have been just... That would have been nausea inducing, not scary.
8533000	8536000	How about connectable? Some of those fuckers are pretty frightening.
8536000	8543000	They said that core gamers dealt better with the scares than the apparently wussy casual players.
8543000	8549000	But they all experienced rapidly increased heart rate, stunted breathing, and a rise in skin temperature.
8549000	8560000	And there were pretty vocal about some of it too, like one of them started screaming, oh my god, oh my god, this shit is so scary.
8560000	8565000	It sounds like Shane when they're playing Silent Hill or something.
8565000	8576000	Other games that were considered but not found scary enough were Left 4 Dead 2, Gears of War 2, Condemned 2, Fear 1 and 2, Dead Space 1, and Silent Hill Homecoming, Alone in the Dark, and Mass Effect 2.
8576000	8579000	But they aren't scary enough to be.
8579000	8587000	I told you about how Silent Hill Homecoming made me basically scream like a little girl and go shut the front door that had blown open from the wind, and oh my god, that was a horrible night.
8587000	8588000	Hearts.
8588000	8594000	Like who sits at home alone in the dark and plays Silent Hill? You're just asking for it.
8594000	8599000	Well, remember when Miklotov was visiting a while back and played through Silent Hill 2?
8599000	8605000	And we were all curled up in your living room, like on the couch, in the dark, watching him play.
8605000	8607000	I don't think I was in there.
8607000	8614000	Actually, no, you weren't. You weren't there. I was there, and it was like, I think Irene was there.
8614000	8617000	And, um, Eddie. I think Eddie was there.
8617000	8619000	But yeah, that was pretty funny.
8619000	8621000	Well, Christopher was there.
8621000	8623000	Because it was when you were living with Christopher.
8623000	8625000	Ah, no, I probably just was out.
8625000	8626000	Yeah, you were gone.
8626000	8629000	I was probably on a hot date.
8629000	8632000	While you nerds were playing Silent Hill.
8632000	8634000	Dude, that shit was awesome.
8634000	8635000	Loki.
8635000	8642000	Um, so of course, you know, one of the pioneers of Project $10 was EA.
8642000	8645000	And EA's been doing this for a while now.
8645000	8650000	Since June of last year, starting with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.
8650000	8657000	They were including, basically, a voucher in their new games that allowed you to get online access.
8657000	8660000	Their online pass, if you will.
8660000	8665000	And if you bought the game used, well, that might not be in there.
8665000	8669000	And so you would have to pay $10 to be able to play online.
8669000	8679000	Well, EA has come out and said that they have made between $10 and $15 million from online pass.
8679000	8686000	And apparently the revenues they said that they derived from that haven't been dramatic.
8686000	8692000	Um, but since they initiated the program, but it's not a failure at all.
8692000	8697000	And when you consider that, that's spread across quite a few games.
8697000	8703000	You know, Tiger Woods, NCAA football, both years for NCAA football and Madden.
8703000	8705000	EA does a lot of sports games.
8705000	8709000	EA, MMA, um, lots of stuff.
8709000	8715000	I don't think any non-sports games have been part of this so far, but it's just been sports games.
8715000	8722000	But also figure, though, that nowadays, especially the EA Sports MMA and some of the older games,
8722000	8729000	it is still cheaper to buy the game with the $10 pass and use rather than buying it new.
8729000	8734000	So, you know, some people might not really think of it as a big deal.
8734000	8742000	And really, they only have to, that's about 1 million people that have bought into this.
8742000	8745000	They've split that across, you know, over five games or whatever.
8745000	8750000	That's, you know, quite a significant amount, I guess.
8750000	8755000	But 200,000 per title, you know, split across platforms and stuff.
8755000	8759000	Wow, they, you know, despite, what do you want to call the number, big or small or whatever,
8759000	8762000	EA made money appear out of nowhere.
8762000	8764000	Yeah, good for them. It's not deserving.
8764000	8769000	I don't think that they need that money because, once again, you know, their complaint was,
8769000	8772000	oh, well, those people that buy the game used, you know.
8772000	8775000	The tax breaks they're getting from the government just aren't enough.
8775000	8776000	Did you read about that this week?
8776000	8778000	Oh, yeah, I read about that.
8778000	8782000	Yeah, and their excuse, well, those people that are buying used, you know,
8782000	8788000	we can't support the online, you know, if they're buying the game used because we don't see any of their revenue.
8788000	8794000	Yeah, that's a nice way to spin it except for the fact that the person that first bought that game brand new
8794000	8798000	already paid you that money to, you know, keep up your network.
8798000	8805000	So, too damn bad. Suck it up. You're EA. You can survive.
8805000	8810000	Well, if you really want to stick it to these developers, you could just say, and publishers and so forth,
8810000	8813000	you could just say, fuck it, I'm not even going to play these games anymore.
8813000	8815000	I'm going to stick to free shit.
8815000	8818000	Or, if you want to play those games, don't play them online.
8818000	8824000	And I'm not talking about piracy. I'm talking about actually designed to be free to play games.
8824000	8830000	And I'm not talking about a crappy little Facebook game like SimSocial, which is a crap that I love.
8830000	8836000	Anyway, but this is a game. It's a free to download game. It's in beta right now.
8836000	8838000	And it's a game called Oniken.
8838000	8846000	Oniken is, I guess, a tribute to challenging 8-bit action games from the NES.
8846000	8850000	They say that the game is actually NES hard.
8850000	8854000	And there's a little clip here I'm going to play in studio, and I think Dark Sakura would be into this
8854000	8859000	because it looks a bit like the guy's weapon he's using is very Strider-esque.
8859000	8863000	But, yeah, once again, this is not like a NES ROM. This is actually-
8863000	8864000	Oh my god, it does look like a cipher.
8864000	8871000	Doesn't it? This is actually designed to be a game on the PC that is just NES tribute, NES style hard.
8871000	8874000	I don't know if that means, like, we're talking La-Mulana.
8874000	8875000	For what?
8875000	8878000	It's like buying a command element.
8878000	8879000	No, not to me.
8879000	8881000	Well, like, the backgrounds.
8881000	8884000	Oh, yeah, the artwork is very Bionic command element style.
8884000	8886000	The gameplay, no, nothing like it, though.
8889000	8890000	It looks really fun, though.
8892000	8894000	Fast forward to some of these other levels.
8894000	8899000	Dude, that almost looks like a rip of the Ninja Gaiden sprite from the original game.
8899000	8901000	Like, they just switched it up a little bit.
8901000	8904000	Like, even his stance and the way he moves and stuff like that.
8904000	8905000	A little bit, huh?
8905000	8909000	Apparently, what's available right now to play three missions in the game.
8909000	8914000	Oniken, again, is the name of the game. O-N-I-K-E-N.
8914000	8918000	Lots of good visuals and so forth if you want to check it out for yourself.
8918000	8925000	Oniken.net. H-T-T-P colon slash slash W-W-W dot O-N-I-K-E-N dot net.
8925000	8928000	And I will go ahead and paste that in chat for the live listeners.
8928000	8931000	Those of you on the podcast, I hope you were writing quickly.
8931000	8936000	Or maybe I can get Dark Soccer to Tumblr or at least the video there, so you guys can check that out.
8936000	8940000	Did you link it? Oh, there it is. Yeah. Okay, I'll put it on the thing.
8940000	8941000	Cool.
8942000	8944000	That was kind of fun. I had to check that out.
8945000	8946000	Big Brother Blade?
8946000	8947000	I like the fact that it's free.
8947000	8951000	Or Ogre Blade? Maybe? Ogre Blade?
8951000	8954000	Free is my favorite word. Absolutely.
8955000	8958000	How about we open up the phone line and take some of your calls right now.
8958000	8961000	1-877-GAME-OLR. Speaking of free, you can call us free on that line.
8961000	8964000	Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8964000	8966000	If you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight,
8966000	8970000	or if you have something gaming related that we haven't quite got to yet,
8970000	8972000	we will talk about that as well.
8972000	8979000	Meanwhile, we're going to fire up the Twitter and get to some of your tweets this week at Twitter dot com slash O-L-R.
8979000	8981000	Going to the tweets real quick.
8981000	8983000	JVMon sent us a tweet tonight.
8983000	8985000	When did WoW, Warcraft, get so fun?
8985000	8989000	I can't stop playing. I blame you. Hugs and kisses.
8989000	8991000	When Cataclysm hit?
8991000	8998000	It's so interesting because to a lot of the hardcore, so to speak, Cataclysm was not so well received.
8998000	9000000	So it's very interesting.
9000000	9006000	I think the changing of the level 1 to 60 areas, though, is great for those that weren't quite yet into WoW.
9006000	9009000	So, I think that was kind of cool, I guess.
9009000	9012000	But yeah, Cataclysm hasn't been all bad news.
9012000	9018000	It's just I think the early game is much more improved than the end game was, if that makes sense.
9018000	9020000	Anyhow, we've got calls coming in, so let's go to it.
9020000	9022000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9022000	9024000	It's the one and only Ranma.
9024000	9026000	Hey, Ranma. What's on your mind, buddy?
9026000	9030000	Oh, last week's podcast. That's what's on my mind tonight.
9030000	9032000	Why is that? It was long, wasn't it?
9032000	9046000	Yes, yes, it was long, and that was the first time in history I've had to listen to it again just to absorb all that big G bullshit, you know what I'm saying?
9046000	9055000	Yeah, last week's show was long because we had an almost additional segment of the show just about the evil G shenanigans.
9055000	9058000	It was something else, and really good discussion last week.
9058000	9064000	An impromptu appearance from Dan in the middle of that discussion, who was on the front lines for some time. It was good.
9064000	9068000	What'd you think of all that, though? Surely you have an opinion.
9068000	9080000	Coming from somebody who has worked in retail and for big chain companies, I strongly believe that Square Enix didn't do anything wrong.
9080000	9085000	The big G is just butthurt, and they're blowing smoke up people's asses.
9085000	9097000	I don't know. I do think it was in bad form for Squeenix to spring that on people, and I think GameStop had the right to know what was in that box and choose not to sell it.
9097000	9107000	And, you know, as I said, I don't want to repeat myself from last week, but as I said, the correct answer was what they finally did too late was just push the game back to Squeenix and refuse to sell it.
9107000	9110000	If they'd just done that to begin with, there wouldn't have been a problem.
9110000	9116000	To be perfectly honest, I do not believe the whole 48 hours thing.
9116000	9128000	Now, during my time working in these big chain companies, when companies like Square, Nintendo, and everybody else, when they're going to do something like that, they send a notice out.
9128000	9135000	Usually about two to three weeks prior before do this.
9135000	9143000	So, I really believe that the big G knew about this, but they were just waiting what to do, what to do.
9143000	9153000	So, I feel that they decide, oh, let's wait about this time, pull the code out, and just start all of this.
9153000	9162000	Part of it could have been a publicity stunt, which I find hard to, but from my retail experience, I don't believe that they just found out two days prior.
9162000	9168000	Because if I'm sick of not understanding how any other chain had an issue with it, you know what I'm saying?
9168000	9172000	It does seem like the memo went out to pull those codes really early on.
9172000	9174000	Like, you know, I don't know, I don't know.
9174000	9178000	But what do you think, though, did you buy Deus Ex on PC out of curiosity?
9178000	9180000	No.
9180000	9182000	Okay, let's assume you had.
9182000	9183000	Yes.
9183000	9186000	Do you think you would have used that coupon for OnLive?
9186000	9188000	Probably not, no.
9188000	9201000	I kind of theorized that I don't think that coupon's really that big a deal, because I think people are going to go use it to kind of check out OnLive and go, ooh, that's kind of neat, and play it for five minutes, and then be done with it, because the games don't really tie.
9201000	9207000	It's not like, I don't know, Portal or something. I don't know, it's not as rich as that kind of connection.
9207000	9213000	But it was just the whole thought that, oh my gosh, you're taking out a $50 coupon.
9213000	9221000	And here's another thing, remember Valve did the same thing, I don't remember the big G having an issue with it.
9221000	9226000	I don't believe the whole spin on how they had this agreement with Valve, you know?
9226000	9236000	Because to be perfectly honest, let's say Square Enix says, oh, because of this, we're no longer selling our products to you.
9236000	9242000	And you know, since Square Enix is one of the big players out there, it would not surprise me if other manufacturers were like, you know?
9242000	9250000	But that's a note, I don't think it's as easy as that, because, you know, Evil G, or as I like to call him, the Evil Genus.
9250000	9258000	The Evil Genus has a huge hold on, you know, the share of the games that they push through is gigantic.
9258000	9265000	True, but I prefer to call them gazpacho stop.
9265000	9267000	I'm sure we could sit here and think of names all day.
9267000	9268000	I know.
9268000	9274000	Alright, alright. Do you have any other thoughts you want to get out before we let you go and get more calls?
9274000	9276000	I've said my thoughts, and one more thing.
9276000	9277000	Yes.
9277000	9285000	Now, whenever they do these price drops, and I know on one episode Arrow was questioning about the whole DS price drop thing.
9285000	9295000	By consumer law, if there is a price drop within 30 days of the price, wherever you bought it from, by law, they have to give you the difference.
9295000	9296000	State or federal.
9296000	9297000	State or federal.
9297000	9298000	What?
9298000	9303000	There's no if, ands, or buts about it. If there's a price drop within 30 days, they have to give you the difference.
9303000	9304000	State or federal law.
9304000	9305000	They don't.
9305000	9306000	That doesn't sound like a law at all.
9306000	9308000	That could be a state.
9308000	9310000	It's consumer law. It's one of the things I had to learn about.
9310000	9314000	But is that consumer law for New York, or is it for federal?
9314000	9317000	That might be the deal, Rama. It might be, because I've never heard of that here either.
9317000	9324000	Well, I do know it's New York state law. Also, same thing in Jersey, Connecticut, and a bunch of other states.
9324000	9330000	It would not surprise me if it was a federal law, but you know how some people do that whole federal law dance thing.
9330000	9334000	It's one of those things we don't get out here on the West Coast, like hurricanes.
9334000	9337000	Which I slept through, by the way.
9337000	9345000	I heard a lot of people did, but I don't mean to make light of a bad situation, because unfortunately, people in Vermont did not fare as well as people in New York City, from what I understand.
9345000	9346000	Pretty much.
9346000	9347000	Hope everybody's alright.
9347000	9348000	Alright, we're gonna let you go, Rama.
9348000	9349000	Thank you.
9349000	9350000	Alright, take care, buddy.
9350000	9351000	Alright, bye.
9351000	9352000	Bye.
9352000	9357000	Alright, I want to go to this aside real quick before we take another call. We've got more calls coming in, but I want to do this real quick.
9357000	9362000	Because we were talking about scary games earlier, and several people in the chatroom brought up Amnesia.
9362000	9369000	And here's the thing, though. The story of The Dark Soccer Road was about 360 games, and Amnesia is a PC-only game.
9369000	9372000	However, it goes without saying that Amnesia is a pretty scary game.
9372000	9376000	And Salacious Pop has been telling me about reaction videos on YouTube.
9376000	9378000	This is a big thing people like to do on YouTube, is reaction videos.
9378000	9383000	Like, I'm sure we've all seen, like, Grandma Watches Two Girls One Cup for the First Time reaction videos, right?
9383000	9388000	But apparently there's reaction video of, like, frat boys playing Amnesia.
9388000	9392000	Well, I asked Salacious Pop to go find me some.
9392000	9395000	So, I've never seen these. This could be a horrible statement.
9395000	9398000	But I want to try playing one of these on air here.
9398000	9399000	So, this is, um...
9399000	9400000	What is this called here?
9400000	9403000	I don't want your stupid advertisement. Let me get through the advertisement.
9403000	9407000	This is Funny Freakouts here, to Amnesia.
9407000	9410000	So, let me, um, get to this.
9410000	9413000	And, uh, let's see.
9413000	9415000	A Funtage, I guess they're calling this.
9415000	9417000	I want to get to... He says a minute thirty-three.
9417000	9419000	So, let me start it there.
9419000	9437000	Oh, shit!
9437000	9438000	Shut up, shut up!
9438000	9439000	In there, in there!
9439000	9442000	Jump in, jump in! Close the door! Close the door! Close the door!
9442000	9444000	Close the door! Close the door!
9444000	9445000	Fuck!
9445000	9447000	No! Don't think!
9447000	9452000	Don't be crouched, crouched, crouched. Don't just...
9452000	9454000	Really carefully, carefully, guys.
9454000	9455000	Oh my god!
9455000	9456000	Shut up!
9456000	9458000	Oh, oh, Jesus Christ!
9458000	9460000	Oh, Jesus Christ!
9460000	9463000	No! No! Run! Run! Run!
9463000	9464000	Run! Where do I go?
9464000	9466000	I hide in there! I hide over here!
9466000	9470000	I love you!
9470000	9471000	Jesus!
9471000	9478000	Run!
9478000	9484000	See, that's the problem, is that when you do 360 only games, you can't include amnesia.
9484000	9486000	I don't want to pay twenty bucks for that.
9486000	9490000	Oh, I have amnesia. You should come over, and we should make a reaction video to amnesia.
9490000	9493000	Because we'll both scream like twelve-year-old girls, we will.
9493000	9496000	I want it, but I don't want to pay twenty bucks for it.
9496000	9498000	I have it. You should come over one night.
9498000	9500000	Like, we could do this on Halloween.
9500000	9501000	Okay.
9501000	9505000	I was, I, who was I, were we talking about this at breakfast, or was I talking about with Salacious Pop?
9505000	9506000	I'm getting old, I forget things.
9506000	9507000	We were talking about it this morning.
9507000	9511000	We were talking about it at breakfast, because, uh, we were talking about Castlevania, or something.
9511000	9512000	Yeah.
9512000	9515000	And I was like, no, we gotta play something really scary, we gotta play amnesia.
9515000	9517000	Which I have yet to, I bought it, but I haven't played it yet.
9517000	9520000	So, like, you'd get some genuine reactions out of me.
9520000	9525000	Okay, I'll do that, I'll be down for that.
9525000	9533000	We might have to have an OLR Halloween special, kind of like, like Nickelodeon would do the Mark Summers Halloween mansion or whatever.
9533000	9538000	We'll have to do Amnesia Night with Dark Sakura, Rob Roberts, and maybe Loki.
9538000	9539000	You hear?
9539000	9541000	You know when I scream when my voice goes away?
9541000	9544000	Salacious Pop, be quiet.
9544000	9545000	Alright.
9545000	9548000	Let's get to some more calls.
9548000	9550000	We've made these people wait through amnesia reaction videos.
9550000	9553000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9553000	9555000	Hey, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto, can you hear me?
9555000	9557000	Yes, we can. Hi, Kaijuto, what's up?
9557000	9563000	Hey, not much, I just wanted to tell you, Rob, last week you spoke about the game Covert Action.
9563000	9565000	Yes, Sid Meier's Covert Action.
9565000	9567000	Yeah, that was actually a favorite game.
9567000	9569000	And that's the CIA calling you right now.
9569000	9570000	Hello?
9570000	9572000	Hi, we can hear you.
9572000	9579000	Okay, anyway, that was a favorite game of mine, too, and I found it about three years ago.
9579000	9587000	You can play it for free online on the PC, and also, you might like this, you'll be able to play it on your Nintendo DS.
9587000	9588000	What?
9588000	9589000	If you have an R4 card.
9589000	9590000	What?
9590000	9591000	I actually play it while I'm in the bathroom.
9591000	9594000	What?
9594000	9596000	Doing some espionage of your own.
9596000	9600000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where I do my best work, man.
9600000	9604000	So yeah, if you have an R4 card, it's really simple, I'm pretty sure Loki can help you out.
9604000	9612000	You get the R4 card, you get the Covert Action ROM somewhere online where you can find it, and then there's like some type of application.
9612000	9616000	I think it, because I have a few of them on my R4, so I don't know which one it is.
9616000	9626000	I think it's the Apple II emulator that you can put on your DS with the R4 that gives you the Covert Action, or it might be one of the others, but it's really easy to find.
9626000	9628000	Wow.
9628000	9629000	Interesting.
9629000	9630000	I don't have an R4 cartridge.
9630000	9631000	I have a spare R4.
9631000	9634000	I'm saying maybe Loki will let me borrow one of his.
9634000	9635000	That's awesome.
9635000	9636000	I loved Covert Action.
9636000	9637000	I don't know what it is about that game either.
9637000	9640000	Dude, Sid Meier, he's the man.
9640000	9642000	He's just, he's played so many good games.
9642000	9644000	And he doesn't like that game for some reason.
9644000	9649000	I think you mentioned yesterday, people said that it was like too many games in one.
9649000	9654000	Sid Meier, that was actually Sid Meier said that they tried to do too much in one game.
9654000	9665000	It was like four separate games that none of them were really fully realized, and you know, and to be fair, the driving game was always kind of dumb anyway.
9665000	9674000	Like the best part was the actual one where you broke in to the facilities, and then there was the cryptogram, that's really easy, and then the switchboard puzzles, the logic puzzles.
9674000	9678000	For the record, Civ V is on sale for 75% off right now.
9678000	9680000	At the top of the show, where were you?
9680000	9684000	Not listening because I don't play Civ, but I'm repeating it.
9684000	9686000	Alright, fair enough. It's worth repeating.
9686000	9691000	And my favorite part of the game was the fact that you can play it over and over again.
9691000	9699000	Like there's always like some type of game tree that you can follow that's never the same kind of like choose your own adventure looks.
9699000	9702000	And that's what I liked about it the most, but definitely check it out.
9702000	9707000	And the cool thing is that when you play the, remember the little top-down game where you're like running through the building?
9707000	9708000	Yeah, that part was like the best.
9708000	9716000	Yeah, that, with this hack on the DS, you could actually use the direction pad to play that version of the game.
9716000	9723000	Now, ActDeftInChat says piracy lounge radio. No, no, I legit own this game back in the day, thank you very much.
9723000	9729000	And just to let them know, the game is officially free online. It's not like you're pirating the game.
9729000	9732000	There's somewhere where they provide it to you for free.
9732000	9740000	And also the Apple II emulator is just a free application for the R4, so it's not really any piracy going on.
9740000	9741000	Nice.
9741000	9743000	This is all just like freeware that's available to you.
9743000	9752000	Oh, this just occurred to me. You know what covert action is like? It's like where in the world is Carmen Sandiego with guns?
9752000	9754000	Okay, this game looks awesome.
9754000	9756000	Oh, it's Cthulhu Saves the World.
9756000	9757000	Yeah, I've never played it.
9757000	9759000	Yeah, those are on Xbox Live in the marketplace.
9759000	9762000	I'm going to hang up and let you get to your next call.
9762000	9766000	Thank you for being courteous, Kaijuto. That's very nice of you. Take care, buddy.
9766000	9769000	Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death 7 are three bucks.
9769000	9774000	Yeah, I want to say there was a story one week. I don't remember how long ago.
9774000	9781000	They sold more on Steam of those games in one weekend than they did the entire time the game was on Xbox Live in the arcade.
9781000	9782000	Wow.
9782000	9785000	But of course, the games are really cheap. They're fun. They're cute.
9785000	9790000	They're definitely a throwback to the old school Super Nintendo RPGs with humor.
9790000	9793000	I like the Cthulhu one because Cthulhu is cute.
9793000	9797000	So you have to check. Did you ever see Hello Cthulhu? Yes, I have.
9797000	9799000	It's like the Hello Kitty doll, but it's Cthulhu.
9799000	9804000	Well, it's it's actually Cthulhu ending up in the Sanrio universe and corrupting Hello Kitty.
9804000	9807000	They personally did like a few of them, but they're super funny.
9807000	9811000	Would that look like the Hello Kitty in the Ursula outfit doll that I bought Salacious Pop?
9811000	9818000	No, it's just a super cute Cthulhu, like a little SD Sanrio-style Cthulhu hanging out with a goth-doubt kitty.
9818000	9822000	I still really want you to have your World of Warcraft character named Ursulol.
9822000	9827000	Well, maybe I'll remake Fatty Cakes into Ursulol, but Fatty Cakes is a good name, too.
9827000	9828000	I'll make Ursulol.
9828000	9831000	All right, let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange and Orange Radio. Who's this?
9831000	9832000	Legend is off of you.
9832000	9834000	Hey, buddy. How you doing?
9834000	9836000	Pretty good, as usual.
9836000	9838000	Good, good. What's up?
9838000	9853000	I guess what I wanted to bring up was the fact that Activision is kind of like trying to get the folks currently on the fence like myself from Modern Warfare 3 on the PC by just like re-adding things that they took out.
9853000	9858000	Case in point, LAN support, in addition to adding dedicated servers.
9858000	9867000	So it's like, I don't know, on one hand, they're trying to make amends, but on the other, you know, I have to believe it has to be like a bait and switch.
9867000	9871000	Interesting, because I remember hearing that they took it out, but I did not hear about them putting it back in.
9871000	9873000	That was for Modern Warfare 2.
9873000	9875000	Interesting.
9875000	9880000	Yeah, so Modern Warfare 3 will actually have LAN support.
9880000	9890000	Well, you know, Blizzard is a huge part of Activision, obviously, and they've come under fire lately because, what, Starcraft 2 does not have the LAN, and Diablo 3 is not going to have it either.
9890000	9894000	Yeah, they're all going to be online for better or for worse.
9894000	9898000	I hate to say it, but I sort of support it with Diablo 3. I don't know.
9898000	9906000	Here's the thing, like, the thing with Diablo 3 is that, let's face it, Diablo 2 was hacked to hell and back, and it, like, you can't play that game online with strangers.
9906000	9909000	It's so broken. You can really only play with people you trust.
9909000	9916000	I think if they had kept, like, a LAN campaign separate from an online campaign, they could have done it, you know?
9916000	9920000	It's kind of disappointing, but, eh, there's always Torchlight 2.
9920000	9922000	Well, that does help.
9922000	9926000	The $20 price tag that was confirmed this week helps, too.
9926000	9946000	Right now, I guess I could, I'll probably give them the benefit of the doubt, but seeing that this is Activision and the fact that they reneged on it back in Modern Warfare 2, when they promised that they were going to have dedicated servers and so forth, only to find out a few weeks before launch that it was quite the opposite.
9946000	9947000	Right.
9947000	9950000	So I don't want to, it's like, I don't want to get fooled again.
9950000	9955000	Um, what did you think of the whole Call of Duty expo that they did, the Call of Duty XP or whatever?
9955000	9961000	I heard bits and pieces, like, people actually doing paintball matches to some of the maps in there.
9961000	9969000	I mean, it's like, I guess they're trying to hype it up to the point where, you know, it's all marketing at this point.
9969000	9988000	I mean, the idea is that Call of Duty is for, you know, quote unquote, kind of like the douchebags game of choice in that regard, whereas Battlefield 3 is mostly for the hardcore, the hardcore nerd gamer that plays these types of FPSs like Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.
9988000	9994000	That's the type of, that's the type of demographic I see EA targeting, you know, with BF3.
9994000	9995000	Right.
9995000	10005000	Whereas Call of Duty is kind of like the dumbed down, basic, um, that's like the one that they're trying to get everyone on board with.
10005000	10008000	It was like a frat boy type game.
10008000	10013000	I know I'm generalizing and you can, you know, you can sue me if you want, but I'm just...
10013000	10014000	No, it's fine.
10014000	10021000	I'm so uneducated on all those games and it's not that I dislike them, they're just not my thing and I'm stuck at them.
10021000	10022000	I'm so terrible at them.
10022000	10029000	It's like some people in DDR, some people think DDR is just, what the hell is that music that's coming out of that machine, you know, and not everybody gets it.
10029000	10041000	Right, right, but I mean, I guess what Activision is banking on is the mere fact that they can sell a shitload of copies of that game, of Modern Warfare, without having to change a lot.
10041000	10055000	And hoping that, you know, as long as you hype it up to the point where they kind of need to have it or else they're going to be the, you know, the unluckiest kid in the block without their copy of Call of Duty.
10055000	10068000	It's kind of like they're trying to create a mindset where you have to one-up your friend or your neighbors and get, you know, and covet that copy of Call of Duty that he has.
10068000	10081000	Whereas Battlefield 3, on the other hand, is going for more detail, more replay, more, let's just say, a lot more features than what Activision is offering.
10081000	10082000	Let's be real.
10082000	10085000	Actually, it's aiming towards being a simulator.
10085000	10086000	Let's be real.
10086000	10087000	A military simulator.
10087000	10089000	Let's be real. Aren't most people just going to get both?
10089000	10096000	Yeah, you're right, they're going to get both, but I could see a lot of those, you know, uneducated, regular token gamers.
10096000	10099000	They're going to just get Modern Warfare 3.
10099000	10102000	Like the really hardcore ones, they're going to get both.
10102000	10105000	They're going to balance time in between the two.
10105000	10106000	Yeah.
10106000	10110000	It's kind of like there's so much I want to play this holiday season.
10110000	10112000	Well, isn't that the case every holiday?
10112000	10121000	Somehow I will have to juggle my time between Skyrim, Diablo 3, Torchlight 2, and God knows it all, I'm forgetting, the Mario Kart on the 3DS.
10121000	10124000	I thought Diablo 3 wasn't coming out this year.
10124000	10125000	I think it will.
10125000	10131000	They haven't said one way or the other, but the friends and family beta is going on right now, which means the public beta is probably next month.
10131000	10135000	I think they're going to announce at BlizzCon that it's coming out within the next month.
10135000	10138000	Why wouldn't they try to make End of Year and have a huge thing?
10138000	10141000	Because Blizzard hasn't released anything else this year.
10141000	10144000	They don't release Diablo, they've released nothing.
10144000	10150000	And they still have to get the expansion pack for Starcraft 2, which is probably next year anyways.
10150000	10151000	That's probably next year.
10151000	10160000	Actually, I didn't make the show world, but there was a story, Blizzard has committed to six games in familiar IPs over the next three years.
10160000	10168000	And most people are speculating that's the two Starcraft 2, Diablo 3 and an expansion, and two WoW expansions.
10168000	10170000	That's it?
10170000	10171000	Which makes sense.
10171000	10176000	And most of them are going to, and pretty much all of them are going to be on PC unless they do like second hand ports.
10176000	10181000	I guarantee Diablo 3 will end up on consoles, it's just not going to be the same time as PC.
10181000	10187000	Yeah, and this is why you always want to, with Blizzard it's always PC or nothing.
10187000	10195000	People forget, Diablo was on the Playstation, Starcraft was on the 64, well some things are better left forgotten.
10195000	10202000	Yeah, some things are better left forgotten than Blizzard's half-assed ports of their properties back in the day.
10202000	10204000	Warcraft comes to mind.
10204000	10210000	It's been 15 years since Diablo on the Playstation 1, so you know, it's worth a try.
10210000	10213000	See, I enjoyed it on my PC, enough said.
10213000	10217000	Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show and have fun.
10217000	10219000	Alright, take care buddy.
10219000	10220000	Have a good one.
10220000	10224000	I think he's going to be broke this holiday season too, I forgot to ask him how much money he plans to spend.
10224000	10226000	Alright, sadly that's going to do it for the Skyplan.
10226000	10229000	I want someone with money to get me a Moonkin hatchling.
10229000	10231000	They're what, 10 bucks?
10231000	10232000	Yeah.
10232000	10234000	Not too bad. But it's virtual pets.
10234000	10237000	I know. That's what I said, I want someone else to get it.
10237000	10240000	How about I donate $10 to a charity in your honor?
10240000	10241000	Okay.
10241000	10242000	Alright.
10242000	10243000	Dude, what the hell?
10243000	10247000	Alright, moving on, I want to finish up the tweet so we can finish up the show tonight.
10247000	10249000	We just had a handful of other tweets.
10249000	10254000	An interesting one from Tigerclaw, tweeting OLR at twitter.com slash OLR.
10254000	10259000	Study suggests virtual goods purchasing differs by ethnicity.
10259000	10266000	Oh boy, this could be a, alright, let's see what this is all about.
10266000	10272000	This is a report for, this is an article from Gamasutra that we were linked to on twitter by user Tigerclaw305.
10272000	10280000	New study published Friday by mobile game community MocoSpace suggests that virtual goods purchasing behavior may be affected by ethnicity.
10280000	10289000	A survey of anonymous data from 40,000 mobile social gamers revealed that both Caucasians and African Americans over indexed on virtual goods spendings.
10289000	10298000	Caucasians in particular were responsible for 26% of virtual goods purchases made during the study period, despite representing only 18% of those studied.
10298000	10304000	African Americans made up 36% of the respondents and made 38% of the purchases.
10304000	10312000	Those calling those Hispanic under indexed despite compromising 31% of the sample pool, they made only 21% of the purchases.
10312000	10316000	Alright, what does this all mean? You know, numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers. What does this mean?
10316000	10324000	According to MocoSpace CEO Justin Siegel, the rapid growth of virtual goods industry means that it, quote, makes sense to really start segmenting it.
10324000	10330000	Quote, we've started to sort our data by a number of criteria, including ethnicity and gender.
10330000	10342000	Over time, this sort of information will change how mobile game developers and publishers create content and market their titles, something that already happening in console and online gaming industry.
10342000	10354000	I'm not really understanding, like, how, but whatever. People get paid to break that data down, just so you know. Somebody got paid to do that study.
10354000	10362000	Last tweet to us tonight from WatchDragon. Beat Space Marine on hard. What is Space Marine? Is that just Halo?
10362000	10365000	No, it's Warhammer 4K Space Marine.
10365000	10372000	Aha! That would explain the rest of this tweet. I play the tabletop Warhammer. It's true to the story and fluff.
10372000	10379000	And fluff. Very cool. Thank you for educating me, Loki, because I did not pick that up.
10379000	10385000	I did not play Warhammer tabletop. The only Warhammer I've ever played was that MMO they put out a couple years ago.
10385000	10387000	You played Warhammer tabletop, didn't you, Darkseid?
10387000	10389000	Hell no. I dated someone who did.
10389000	10390000	Oh, that's-
10390000	10391000	So sick of those stupid little-
10391000	10395000	Oh, you had figurine trauma in that relationship.
10395000	10396000	Yes, because-
10396000	10400000	I tried playing Warhammer 4K Space Marine.
10400000	10401000	Did you?
10401000	10412000	Warhammer 4K Space Marine was more of the larger scale battles, smaller scale figurines. The actual Space Marines were 6mm tall figurines.
10412000	10418000	I did not paint those. I tried painting them and I'm like, fuck that. It's too damn small.
10418000	10419000	Alright.
10419000	10423000	And I threw it all away. Because I'm like, I don't get this game.
10423000	10428000	I haven't played Dungeons and Dragons in like four years. I should play some time. I don't know. I just sound like a total nerd.
10428000	10432000	Maybe I didn't throw it away. I think I might have it in a box somewhere.
10432000	10438000	Alright. That does it for Twitter topics tonight. Tweet us for next week. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
10438000	10441000	Let's go to Loki and see if he has any last minute stories.
10441000	10447000	Um, just real quick. Rookies won't appear in NBA 2K12 until lockout's over.
10447000	10451000	So, there's gonna be an update or something like that for free once-
10451000	10452000	Lockouts are ruining everything.
10452000	10458000	Once that happens, you won't be able to play as, you know, till it happens you won't be able to play as the rookies.
10458000	10464000	Um, there's some mysterious move game in development from the people that did Linker in Shadows.
10464000	10472000	Remember that really weird dog flying thing with the basset hound and the shadow creatures that look like the squid from The Matrix or whatever?
10472000	10475000	Actually, I don't remember that and it's probably for the best.
10475000	10482000	Probably is kinda artsy. Um, so now they have a teaser, uh, trailer thing on YouTube.
10482000	10487000	I don't even know if it's really a teaser, but it's a thing called the Odd Forest.
10487000	10494000	And it basically looks like some sort of move game where you're interacting with objects by touching them and stuff.
10494000	10505000	I would almost go and say, you know, they could very well be like trying to put some sort of, you know, touch sensitive glove or something in play.
10505000	10513000	Cause it's almost like all this stuff is just, you know, focusing on the textures of different things and obviously with the movie you're not gonna be able to feel any of that.
10513000	10519000	So, I don't know. But right now, weird video that's online so you can check it out.
10519000	10524000	And that's pretty much it.
10524000	10529000	Alright, well this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10529000	10532000	So, Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. Your final thought tonight?
10532000	10534000	Duffy.
10534000	10541000	My final thought tonight is tacos! Again. And baking cupcakes causing sugar headaches.
10541000	10543000	Those cupcakes single-handedly are gonna make me diabetic.
10543000	10544000	I have a sugar headache right now.
10544000	10548000	I know, right? That's why I ran to get water during one of the reports. Crazy.
10548000	10551000	Anyway, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10551000	10557000	My final thought is I made a flamethrower in Grand Theft Auto. And no one else has.
10557000	10559000	And happy birthday once again.
10559000	10560000	Thank you.
10560000	10562000	So, hope you had a good one.
