14486	23742	September 11, 2011 Details leak on the new 3DS Circle Pad Xbox Live issues bans for theft And is the Wii U running into problems?
31755	38478	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of that show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38958	46161	We are live on this Sunday night and you can head over to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to participate live in our chat room.
46961	58926	If you want to hear the stream, hopefully you're already on the stream, but I'll say it for the sake of the podcast listeners, you can tune in Sunday nights, www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
59366	62492	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
62672	65938	First off, say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
66298	66338	Hi.
66599	67180	How are you, Ms.
67220	67500	Summers?
68129	68469	Hungry.
68870	69530	You're hungry?
69790	73012	But it looks like you're eating over there, so you're getting that hunger problem fixed, right?
73072	73293	Yes.
73713	74694	It's very nutritious.
75174	76015	Nutritious, delicious?
76175	78857	It's brown rice and tempeh with okonomiyaki sauce.
78957	80197	I love brown rice and vegetables.
81678	81979	Really?
83019	83840	It's worse than dog food.
85041	85681	Dog-a-chow.
86782	89664	Also say hello to the one, the only, Tech Master, Loki!
89804	90044	Hello.
90364	91025	And how are you, Loki?
91625	92186	I'm fine.
92486	96709	And of course, to answer the question in our chat room, what did you get for dinner tonight?
98403	105770	Um, well, I got another double bacon western burger, but I'm not even really that hungry.
105830	110094	But I figured, you know, if I don't eat something, I'm going to be hungry later because I had a big lunch, but it was around 1.
110134	119202	And, you know, if I don't eat anything between 1 o'clock and, you know, 11 o'clock or whatever, I'll probably be starving by 11.
120601	132037	You know what I had to hold me over for tonight's show is a Frappuccino That's the food I had this week But I will be getting something more substantial after the show Hey, it's pumpkin spice Frappuccino, it's really good
132785	134966	Why is your kick with pumpkin spice lately?
135166	136107	This is my favorite time of year.
136127	136727	I love pumpkin.
136747	137547	I love pumpkin pie.
137968	139208	They have pumpkin Pop-Tarts now.
139748	144211	And oh my gosh, oh my gosh, they now make Hershey's Kisses that are pumpkin spice flavored.
144751	146872	It's heaven.
147592	148253	It's great.
149113	150293	And they don't pay me to say that.
150374	151434	It really is that good.
151754	154616	Or to quote Rob from WOW last night, it tastes like world peace.
154636	155696	It did taste like world peace.
156076	159438	All right, we do have a guest on tonight's show, at least going to join us for at least the first half here.
159818	160438	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
176790	180831	It's okay to use it for Orange Lounge Radio because that's how people know me here.
181332	184853	I don't understand your nickname.
184893	186153	When does Prince want to be Prince?
186233	186993	He's always Prince.
187233	188334	Yeah, I'm like Prince 2.0.
189754	191095	Welcome back to the show, Rice Princess.
191375	191815	Thank you.
192535	193575	What's new in your world?
194656	199277	Let me have you reintroduce yourself for those that are newer to Orange Lounge Radio who weren't here 100 episodes ago.
199637	201038	You're a gamer girl, obviously.
202278	203238	Sort of.
203599	204439	Yeah, I don't know.
204579	204999	I've kind of
205734	207295	What, you don't play games anymore?
207555	207995	I thought you did.
208015	211157	It's not that I'm not interested in playing games, I just don't have time.
212478	213659	But I would if I could.
213819	214940	Have you been playing anything lately?
215700	215920	No.
216421	216761	Really?
217801	218302	Not, no.
218662	222684	I thought you and your boyfriend had a Wii and at least were playing stuff on that, or is it mostly him?
223725	224606	It's mostly him.
224866	230209	We have a Gamefly account and he'll get games and then I'll watch him play them, but I just don't have the energy to play anything.
230229	231110	Well, then get off the show.
231130	231690	I'm just kidding.
232451	234692	But you do love your classic games at least, right?
235311	237113	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
251289	252110	Your favorites.
252270	254231	Well, my favorite is Chrono Trigger.
255691	256832	Final Fantasy Tactics.
258192	259573	It's pretty close to Chrono Trigger.
261494	262214	Super Metroid.
262614	267777	Just really from the Super Nintendo era, most of the games on the Super Nintendo.
267797	269237	Super Nintendo was just perfect gaming, wasn't it?
269257	270738	That was the golden system.
270838	271939	Yes, it was.
272099	273019	I agree in many ways.
273159	275060	I don't know if gaming will ever be that good ever again.
275540	277041	Gaming is just different now.
277521	278464	Oh yeah, it just is.
278544	281993	Especially a game I was playing this week that I'll get into later in my gaming week.
282595	284159	It's like interacting with a movie now.
284239	284400	It's not...
286604	287844	I mean, it's not a bad thing.
288385	294226	It's just, you know, and maybe this is a little bit of get off my lawn syndrome, but it's just not the same like it was.
294526	305270	No, no, you know, okay, so if you have been listening for a while, you know that I hate Microsoft and like the Xbox systems that they have, but we actually ended up buying one.
305790	308911	Like, I finally allowed my boyfriend to have one in the house.
308951	314173	Which is a huge deal because when you were on the show before, you were very staunch anti-Microsoft, anti-Xbox.
314233	314973	Yes, but...
316388	317149	Oh, what?
317389	317989	Yes, I am.
318129	319810	No, no, I just mean console-wise.
319950	321411	Like, I don't like Microsoft.
322332	323953	But the Wii is a piece of shit.
324193	326434	The PS3 is way too much, and they don't have any good games.
326694	329016	And it's just, he really wanted one, and I'm like, fine.
329136	331277	You know, I can't hold them back any longer.
331297	335559	I have to admit that it's probably the best system out right now, console-wise.
335940	341703	But when we get games on that console, I really feel like an idiot, like a retard.
341763	343224	Like, I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
343504	351548	They're all first person shooter controls and you kind of have to go to game college to learn the controls on these games.
351608	352188	It's crazy.
352308	354689	You want to go back and just play Puzzle Fighter HD Turbo all day?
354729	357030	I want two buttons on my controller, god damn it.
357351	360792	I'm tired of all this stupid bullshit.
361673	367175	I guess it just takes a little bit more effort to learn how to play a game, but I don't know.
367315	368196	Some of the games are pretty good.
368216	371497	Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here on the show tonight?
371557	372878	Usually our guests want to plug something.
374089	374850	No, not really.
375350	375610	Okay.
375810	376831	Thought I'd offer.
377011	377851	Oh, no, it's fine.
377911	378372	Yeah.
378872	379152	All right.
379712	383094	Well, you'll be joining us throughout the show and offer your witty insight and commentary.
383194	383594	Please do.
384095	384335	Maybe.
384495	385875	As we continue on throughout tonight's show.
386136	387196	DarkSakura wants her mic back.
387516	388977	I really like your Avengers t-shirt.
391178	391779	Thank you very much.
393909	395550	I just looked over and saw Ms.
395590	396670	Marvel and it made me happy.
418001	441732	I was fortunate when I was 17 years old I got to go to the Trade Center and I have a very vivid memory of being on the roof of the Trade Center but I drove by it with a big hole in it oh and you it was right after the bottom floor got bombed oh gosh when I was 17 wow and it's just you know the whole thing watching on a phone TV was just just just so difficult and everything and
442152	457413	and you know we have a lot of listeners in New York City and back east and all those places that we're affected and it's like you know the impact we felt 3,000 miles away I can't even imagine just that experience so you know we should never forget what happened
457993	458694	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
474951	499715	uh if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise you wouldn't feel it no she wouldn't i do pet her with my foot though so i don't have to bend over as i was saying if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise kind of a tough day for some people uh then i think we've done our job so and uh fuck terrorists like seriously fuck them they suck so if we do what we do then they don't get it we can commemorate something else today
500134	500674	That's right.
500794	505977	Let's move on because something else monumental happened today, 31 years ago.
506498	507258	And you know what that is?
508219	509540	Loki was born, everybody.
509580	510940	It's Loki's birthday.
511481	512081	Yay.
512121	513582	Happy birthday, Loki.
514402	522787	So in commemoration, it looks like Irene has actually brought over some bacon cupcakes for Loki.
522827	523148	I love this.
523168	524328	Did you get a picture up on the website?
524348	524588	Yes, I did.
524949	525249	Awesome.
525869	527630	They should be on orangejonesradio.com.
527730	528310	Go look at it now.
528350	529270	I'll eat them later.
529430	530271	I can't eat them right now.
530291	532311	I'm too full from the other bacon stuff.
534032	535052	I really shouldn't have eaten that.
535112	535773	It was too much.
535793	540394	It was like, milkshake or bacon burger.
540414	541495	And I was like, bacon burger.
542755	543795	Should have gone for the milkshake.
544076	547997	So, any good video game related loot for your birthday or not yet?
548417	548617	Nope.
549237	550258	Well, someone...
552039	553460	I really hate not remembering.
554321	557783	Someone gifted me an Xbox Live code last night.
558384	562948	I didn't get to check what it was for yet.
563668	564569	So that's kind of cool.
566671	568092	You'll have to check that out.
568272	568812	Let's see...
572352	573934	I was going to look up real quick.
573994	579059	Ryan Belknap gifted me something from Xbox Live.
579560	582603	I will go check that out, and I really appreciate it.
582723	585666	I didn't really get on my Xbox today.
585706	588089	It was like, last night sucked.
588129	590972	My cat was being an asshole, so I didn't get it.
591172	593795	Heartland-y sleep, like maybe a few hours.
594715	607604	And, um, he just, today I ended up sleeping in and then it was like out to lunch and then came back and started messing with Grand Theft Auto stuff, so didn't get a chance to boot it back up again, but, oh well.
608125	611507	Well, I hope your birthday is awesome and, uh, congratulations.
611727	612028	Thank you.
612248	620013	We're all, we're all in our 30s now, so, uh, it's the, it's the podcast, oh, not, not, uh, Irene, but Chloe, you're just, you're just visiting tonight.
620774	623296	So, yeah, we're now the podcast for those in their mid-30s.
624767	625088	Awesome.
625629	626049	Whatever.
626230	627993	I understand what's hip and cool nowadays.
628013	629616	Except for Toy Trends.
629776	631058	I don't understand that crap.
631219	638191	I think they're just making all sorts of weird shit up now and kids are just buying it and I don't get it.
639113	639613	You know what?
640554	646178	When kids are maybe about one and a half and younger, they don't care.
647279	651142	They'll play with the box, save some money, and buy them a box.
651182	656425	I seem to recall Josh, your kid, really loved the Kinect calibration card.
656465	656906	Still does.
658687	659327	For real.
659387	660688	The wacky, creepy, happy face.
660728	661429	Babies are like cats.
663737	666918	You can go buy the most expensive cat toy ever, but they don't care.
666958	668998	They want to play with the twist ties and the box.
669019	671019	So if you drop them from six feet, they'll land on all fours?
671479	671619	No.
672499	673280	I said they're light cats.
673320	674340	I didn't say they were cats.
675820	679061	And besides that, it's not like they have clear vision until they're, you know, ten months old anyway.
679361	683923	It is pretty true that they do like all sorts of random stuff.
684123	688344	Usually, I mean, he'll chase after sunlight on the floor.
690222	691749	So pretty much anything amuses him.
692753	693758	Save money, everybody.
693979	694762	Don't buy them toys.
694883	695506	Buy them twist ties.
695967	698109	I'm more loyal to games than systems anyway
723909	727392	Kind of an interesting comment, and I see Irene shaking her head over there.
727412	728512	What do you think of that comment?
729773	731394	I was nodding my head.
732495	733976	Shaking it up and down, of course.
734036	734617	Yes, of course.
736018	738059	No, I mean, I can understand that.
739760	743943	Well, really, okay, when we grew up, we only had one system in the house at a time.
744003	747606	We didn't have a Genesis and a Super Nintendo and all that stuff.
747786	750608	I think we all grew up in families that couldn't afford that.
751403	751803	Except for you.
752684	755385	No, I didn't have a Genesis and Nintendo and all that stuff at the same time.
755706	755986	Oh, okay.
756046	757547	I only ever had Nintendo systems.
757767	759188	I had Nintendo, Super Nintendo.
759448	761629	Well, I lied because then I had a PlayStation, but I didn't have a 64, so.
762310	762610	Yeah.
763010	764111	I've been pretty loyal to my Nintendo.
764231	765251	I threw away 64 one day.
765352	765912	Oh my gosh.
766348	772809	Well, I bought it from my ex-girlfriend's brother at the time, and then I was just like, I don't want this, so I threw it away.
772829	774770	So you just threw it away.
774850	777310	Okay, we know who came from the richest household.
777510	777830	Exactly.
777850	779731	No, it wasn't even, it was way late.
779751	782711	I just decided one day I didn't want it anymore, so I threw it away.
782791	783651	Carry on, carry on.
783671	785232	No, it was way later.
785632	790112	Like, we're talking like in the 2000s when I bought the stupid Nintendo 64.
790173	791453	It wasn't, you know...
793072	795173	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
810098	812239	for like my graduation deal or something.
812760	819444	And then my roommate's boyfriend left his PlayStation in the room because he didn't have a TV in my dorm room.
820004	823546	So I did have multiple systems, but it was because of circumstance.
826908	829390	So I think it all goes with the golden rule of gaming.
829430	833892	Going back to the comment, you know, what we always say here on Orange Lounge Radio, system is only as good as the games that are on it.
834152	835093	Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.
836693	844880	I was very much an Xbox hater for the first generation of Xbox systems, but then after that, it was just kind of alright.
846201	852647	Well, when I borrowed my friend's Genesis, he had a PowerBase converter and tons of Master System games too, so...
854189	857291	I think PlayStation 3 is coming an awfully long way, too.
857331	861494	When they first came out, they were kind of the laughingstock of the industry, and for many good reasons.
861574	868139	But despite the hack earlier this year, which I still say, Microsoft isn't as invulnerable as all y'all think.
868219	871161	Remember, I had $150 stolen just last month.
871221	873002	I have a follow-up on that I'm going to get to in a minute, by the way.
873622	876484	But I think PlayStation 3 is coming off a long way since then.
876524	878365	I think they've got a lot of really good stuff going for them there.
878526	882048	Obviously, LittleBigPlanet is one of my favorite games ever to come out this generation.
883009	883529	Lots of good stuff.
883989	886071	Anyhow, other things I want to talk about.
886372	887993	I guess I'll mention the Xbox Live hack.
888093	893358	If you go back about four weeks ago on the show, I talked about how I had money stolen from my Xbox Live account.
893719	898003	Called Microsoft, was told that in 21 days they'd get the money back and whatever.
899127	912671	I got an email from them about 25 days after, it was about Wednesday, saying that they apologized for the inconvenience, but they did the investigation and that they concluded it was indeed fraudulent and I will be getting the money back on my account.
913211	918272	And then they sent me like three separate codes for one month of Xbox Live Gold.
918872	926616	So, I guess the cool thing is, even though I haven't been able to play my Xbox for the past 21 days, 25 days, month, basically, I got the codes.
926976	930718	So, now I got to extend out my Xbox Live Gold for three months.
930738	939883	So, I guess that's cool, but I'm still waiting for the money because the email I got said, it may take up to 10 days for the money to actually get credited to your credit card or whatever.
939903	942084	And I'm just like, oh my God, it's been over a month.
942544	944805	That's 150 bucks I had to eat for a month.
945086	946866	I mean, luckily I have a savings account, but it's just...
948307	969014	kind of irritating I mean really it takes that long to figure out that a different IP and different MAC address Xbox probably in another country logged in and did it you know it's just come on but whatever at least it's on the path to getting fixed and I was able to finally play the 360 this week a little bit I'll talk in a moment about some things I was playing on there
970140	972160	One other thing I want to bring up because I was thinking about this today.
973381	980962	I was at Fry's, which obviously is a big retailer out here on the West Coast, a big electronics store, and was looking at 3DS games randomly.
981642	983883	And, you know, Star Fox 64 just came out.
984843	993645	And I was looking at the Namco Generations that just came out as well, which is, you know, for us folks that like our retro games, it's like a Pac-Man reimagining, Pac-Man Championship Edition.
993685	994825	I think Galaga...
995265	997027	It's the Pac-Man and Galaga Legions.
998268	999128	Dimensions, I'm sorry.
999649	1001891	Yeah, Dimensions, so it's all 3D and all that stuff.
1001911	1003212	And I was really tempted to get it.
1003492	1003712	Don't.
1004092	1004893	Well, here's the thing.
1004933	1006534	I looked at the price tag and I was like, it's $40.
1006735	1006534	$40?
1006795	1007996	3DS games are $40.
1008076	1009477	I get that, but... I know, it's Pac-Man.
1013360	1019866	It's interesting to me because they just recently cut the cost of the 3DS from $250 to $160.
1019906	1023149	But I don't know if that's really the problem.
1023229	1024330	The problem are those games.
1024370	1025451	Those games are too expensive.
1025471	1026712	I'll talk to my Namco guy.
1026772	1030195	He's like, dude, I got tons of 3DS games.
1030775	1032337	I just ended up giving them away to my friends.
1032357	1034058	I'm like, sweet, cool, send me some.
1034218	1034739	I mean...
1035379	1037421	I'm not gonna say no to that, that's for sure.
1037481	1044028	But for the masses and everybody out there, and even other games, like Star Fox 64, I might have considered buying if it was $20.
1044128	1045609	Yeah, you know why?
1045710	1054799	It's because they claim that it's like, oh, well, it takes extra development time and stuff to develop the extra dimension or whatever it is.
1055359	1058940	or maybe the dev kids cost a little more.
1058980	1068563	The cost more for the other dimension is a load of turd because they came out and they said any game that uses a z-axis in calculation you can easily adapt it to 3D.
1068743	1070263	It's just another virtual camera.
1070724	1071664	It's ridiculous.
1072504	1075805	Anybody who says that that extra dimension should cost more money is full of crap.
1075825	1078806	No, it's just because it's a new generation they think they can up the prices.
1079346	1081508	and I think that's going to be the problem holding it back.
1081748	1096499	You know, and it's interesting to me because there's been a lot of talk lately about how stubborn Nintendo has been and how much they have really not liked the mobile gaming stuff because 99 Cent Angry Birds has been cheapening quote unquote the game industry as a whole.
1097339	1104186	and I'm kind of like, well, I don't think 99 Cent Angry Birds is the reason why I feel like a $40 Pac-Man Galaga game is a rip-off.
1104326	1106549	I don't care how many dimensions the fucking game has.
1107009	1110433	I'm just like, $40 is a lot.
1110733	1118881	Nintendo's dumb in the sense that they think that a game like Angry Birds, a very basic physics puzzler game, I mean...
1119582	1120142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1149150	1149450	Done.
1149470	1151212	99 cents.
1151252	1153253	You put it right out there, everyone will buy that shit.
1153333	1158617	The price of all these games really has to make me stop and think about what I really want.
1158657	1162920	I mean, even $60 for a 360 or PlayStation 3 game is asking a lot of money.
1163301	1166363	And there's only a certain kind of game that I'm willing to pay that for.
1167003	1169886	Gone are the days that you would just pick up a game on a whim.
1170686	1171207	You know what I mean?
1171347	1173649	Like, remember when you just, yeah, pick up a game on a whim.
1173689	1174429	It looks interesting.
1174449	1174930	I'll try it.
1175310	1177071	You know, those days really seem gone.
1178592	1183676	Looking at the holiday, there's so many games coming out, and I'm really having to choose, like, okay, I gotta drop 60 bucks on all these games.
1183757	1184737	What am I actually gonna buy?
1185118	1185618	Skyrim.
1186138	1187239	See, that's the thing, though, is...
1188300	1203819	Yes, gone are the days of buying something on a web, not necessarily playing something on a web, especially some, you know, how easy it is to pirate things nowadays on certain systems, so...
1204199	1206102	Yeah, but that's a whole nother Oprah.
1206122	1206683	You know what I mean?
1208586	1210328	Not even going into the piracy angles.
1210368	1212331	Let's just say that most people don't do that.
1212471	1212812	I don't.
1213473	1214494	Well, there's a lot of stuff.
1214514	1216297	I'll look at games that are coming out.
1216317	1217198	I'm like, hey, you know what?
1217258	1218100	That'd be kind of cool to get.
1218120	1218861	But then I ask myself...
1219281	1234163	I'm really going to play this because I have a lot of games that I buy and end up not really playing or finishing or something and I figure I should just finish the ones I have first and then buy the ones I really want and end up just not missing the ones I end up skipping on.
1234741	1236763	You know, interesting comment in our chatroom.
1237103	1242007	PartMachine in our chat says, if people played PC games, this would not be a problem.
1242567	1250794	Interesting that that comment is said because one of the places where I do buy things on a whim, just because they're cheap and they look interesting, is Steam.
1253055	1256538	You know, I bought a game on there for like $1.50 the other day.
1256638	1256878	Why?
1256898	1260241	Because it was $1.50 and it was a puzzler and it looked interesting and I like puzzle games.
1260715	1263196	And if it sucks, it's only $1.50, right?
1263597	1270140	So funny enough, that is the place where I tend to spend a little more frivolously.
1271020	1271541	So I don't...
1273035	1273856	Maybe he's right.
1274817	1276838	Well, just like, you know, like virtual console stuff.
1276878	1278019	Remember virtual console stuff?
1278419	1280741	It's like six bucks a pop for NES games.
1280801	1287506	I mean, fuck, you can get those NES games in NES form on cartridges for a lot cheaper than that.
1287927	1290469	And I just, I don't see the point.
1290549	1291970	Especially when they're not doing anything.
1292230	1293951	They're dumping a ROM into an emulator.
1294832	1295913	Why should they give you money for that?
1296573	1298115	I can go download that for free.
1298275	1301818	Is this a rant about the Mario 25th anniversary collection disc?
1302018	1302118	Oh!
1303459	1305000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1327674	1328495	Thanks for watching!
1345262	1349866	You only have yourself to blame for Nintendo having $40 games on the 3DS.
1349926	1353909	It's because you're an idiot and you will buy this $30 Mario game.
1353929	1354850	That's literally wrong.
1354950	1359975	They could have put it on the Virtual Console, sold it for $10, and would have been the same damn game.
1360275	1364038	But no, Nintendo being smart, they said, hey, you know what, we're going to charge $30 for it.
1364078	1365179	We'll call it Limited Edition.
1365199	1366400	We're actually going to make it Limited.
1366760	1370784	And now that shit goes on eBay for like $80 because people are dumb.
1372034	1376255	Well, at the same token, today I said no to buying that game.
1376455	1380015	I looked at the game and I said, this looks really good, but I'm going to wait for it to end up in the clearance bin.
1380956	1383636	Yeah, and I know, I mean, I said the same thing about the Mario game.
1383656	1384616	I'm like, eh, screw it.
1385136	1389337	But at the same time, a lot of other people didn't, and they're all sold out.
1389757	1396698	And I understand, yeah, they may have been quite limited, but we're talking limited as in a few hundred thousand copies.
1396978	1400879	I mean, that's a lot of money that they made from a ROM.
1402359	1407681	Speaking of PC games that Chat Comet has me thinking and Steam and Good Deals, I've got to plug this.
1407901	1410342	I just, I have to as a fan of this game.
1411323	1417345	Civilization 5 is on sale right now and probably by the time the podcasties hear this, the sale will probably be done because I think it was just the weekend.
1417625	1420486	But at least for the live folks, it's like $12.50 right now for Civ 5.
1421206	1423327	My favorite Civilization since the original, for real.
1423567	1424768	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1424808	1425128	I played WoW.
1453877	1455718	Wow, what a different week for you.
1455818	1456899	I got Rebecca Black to 80.
1456979	1460801	I think it's funny you have a character named Rebecca Black.
1460821	1462102	I made it as a total joke.
1462522	1463783	It hasn't had to change your name yet.
1464203	1464384	No.
1465244	1466685	Well, I'm not going to pay to change your name.
1466745	1468686	If they want me to change your name, they're going to give me a free name change.
1469046	1469707	They usually do.
1469967	1471868	And then I'm going to name her Becca Black.
1474130	1475591	Or maybe Lady Arc Music.
1475851	1476291	Friday.
1476951	1477852	Friday, that'd be funny.
1478993	1482016	I was going to change Fatty Cakes to Ursulol, but I like Fatty Cakes.
1483797	1486860	And then I played some Tiny Tower and Sims.
1487300	1490483	I played Sims 3 and the stupid other Sims.
1492064	1496088	I just completely rearranged my house while you were here.
1496764	1497644	Sim's social, like...
1521989	1528873	Slash's Pop was telling me he tried to find a video that he posted to my wall and he couldn't find it amongst all the bullshit SimSocial posts.
1529274	1531955	And you can block the app, but that only goes so far.
1532075	1534697	Like, then when you go to the page, it doesn't show anything.
1534717	1538119	You keep having to load because that SimSocial posts so much stuff.
1538159	1539000	I mean, it's just...
1540040	1547206	I want the game to come out on Google Plus because at least Google Plus kind of exiles that all to one, like the game stuff all has to be on a separate page.
1547806	1551849	So I really want SimSocial on Google Plus, but they probably won't bring it there for that reason.
1552209	1558214	That's probably how they've got an assload of players is because it's all over Facebook and people are like, the Sims?
1558594	1559575	I love that game.
1559655	1562697	I'm pissed off that my mother hasn't become my neighbor and I'm going to fuss at her.
1563337	1563798	No, I'm kidding.
1564518	1584938	but um I'm apparently though in the game randomly dating like one of my old friends from the AOL days I am uh I'm actually a dating mistress Tia if you remember her from the show we're we're boyfriend and girlfriend in SimSocial and uh she came over for some woohoo the other day I can't woohoo my girlfriend in game because she doesn't have a double bed but we can play in the bathtub
1586875	1587475	Wow!
1588536	1590656	You can click on the bathtub and woohoo in the bathtub.
1590736	1594137	It's gonna be one of those weeks here on Orange Slouch Radio.
1594378	1595778	I found a mod, by the way, for Sims 3.
1595818	1597379	Wait a minute, don't you have a spa in your house?
1597419	1598659	You can't woohoo in the spa?
1598819	1599319	At her house.
1599359	1600660	Trust me, you can woohoo in the spa.
1600700	1601220	At her house.
1601600	1601900	Oh, okay.
1602340	1602600	I see.
1603060	1607602	But I did find there's a patch for Sims 3 where you can change woohoo to fuck.
1610219	1635222	and they're finally breaking the animations where they're doing items with custom animations so everyone look toward Sexy Sims 2 for new mods because I had a ton of them on Sims 2 because I'm a little prevert I also played some Osutatakayo Endon while I was at school because I was bored and I started reading a book but I don't like it so I'm not going to read it anymore
1636522	1637625	I have to write a review on it.
1637686	1640554	So look on Geek Life for the Too Long Didn't Read.
1641852	1642232	Alright.
1642973	1643213	Plug.
1643653	1645594	Let's move on to Techmaster Loki.
1645634	1647255	How was your gaming week?
1647375	1649356	Didn't play a ton of different things.
1649696	1652777	Mainly just Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon.
1653378	1659581	I'm starting to level up my Jet character now, so that's at level 5, I believe.
1660341	1665724	And, you know, my Tactical's at 8, and just playing a little bit more of that.
1665744	1669646	We were trying to play some of the Remix missions on Inferno, and it was just...
1670206	1673128	It's as hard as Inferno in the first game, which is really hard.
1674329	1675890	Then more Grand Theft Auto stuff.
1676110	1683415	I've been messing around with that and made some new mods that no one's done yet, so I'll have to work on that stuff later on.
1686598	1687438	What else did I play?
1689700	1690801	I think that's pretty much it.
1690921	1695544	I tried that vid rhythm once, and it was just kind of like, eh.
1696825	1699607	Which didn't end up being a game, which although the app itself
1700316	1700916	Thanks for watching!
1720714	1722235	There's nothing really rhythm about it.
1722295	1724977	It's just vid record clip.
1726558	1727218	Vid clipping.
1727818	1728619	Pretty much, yeah.
1729900	1730760	Anything else in your gaming week?
1731020	1732321	That's it.
1732781	1735363	I know, Irene, you said you've been very busy at school lately.
1736023	1739185	Is there anything that you have been playing in the past week or so that you want to acknowledge?
1740706	1741407	Guild Wars.
1742427	1744829	Oh, you've been playing Guild Wars, like old school Guild Wars, huh?
1744849	1745629	How's that been going for you?
1747690	1750332	Well, it's been going well.
1751954	1753276	What do you do in Guild Wars?
1753316	1754618	Why do you keep playing Guild Wars?
1755659	1764290	Because it's free and I don't have a lot of time to play, so I won't feel like a stupid bitch if I pay $15 a month for a game that I never play.
1765410	1782258	so Guild Wars, Guild Wars I've always kind of called the game at least there's always Guild Wars you know when you have to quit WoW and Final Fantasy XI or whatever your MMO addiction is a choice at least there's always Guild Wars if you've bought it at some point whether it be back when it first came out or one of those ridiculous Steam sales
1782478	1783338	Thanks for watching!
1798144	1806349	and people are drawing conclusions from this that Final Fantasy XI is looking to ditch the PlayStation 2 because that's what's holding it back, tech-wise.
1806769	1813494	If Final Fantasy XI could ditch the PlayStation 2, they could do all new textures, the game could get an overhaul.
1813894	1820278	That would be very interesting because then Final Fantasy XI could hypothetically look like Final Fantasy XIV but not suck.
1821489	1824072	Let me just get rid of Final Fantasy XIV.
1824132	1825394	Just pretend it doesn't exist.
1825974	1827035	Tell everybody, hey, you know what?
1828016	1829578	I know you bought Final Fantasy XIV.
1831380	1832061	We're just going to make it XI.
1834280	1835181	We'll call it 14.
1835221	1837702	We'll just upgrade 11 to 14.
1838202	1847507	11 other M. Let me go back to Guild Wars for a minute because I've got to say I am really excited looking at the Guild Wars 2 footage even though it doesn't really look like Guild Wars 1 at all.
1848228	1852530	And I know you can kind of start earning stuff for Guild Wars 2 in Guild Wars right now.
1852850	1853991	Are you excited about...
1854721	1855682	Guild Wars 2 at all?
1873564	1901254	they really try to go out of their way in their developer stuff to really say like it's it's this isn't like other MMOs and we're trying to not approach this like other MMOs we're not trying to emulate other MMOs but my only issue with that is that that's what everybody else has said too and it just ends up being wow but you know what they're able to back up their claims if you look at the gameplay footage if you like look at the screen art all that stuff you know that it's different from wow so it's not just another wow clone is that supposed to be a 2011 release or is that not till next year
1901929	1923463	uh no they haven't even done beta for it oh so it's not going to be out for a while gotcha yeah well good that's one less game i have to buy this year yeah because i i will yeah it looks looks pretty awesome from the stuff i've seen yeah i'm way more interested in that than even like old republic sorry star wars fans but i'm just i guild wars 2 looks awesome yeah i could talk for hours about it but i won't
1924215	1924755	Oh, but you should.
1924855	1925776	Why don't you start right now?
1927397	1928898	And then you're just going to cut off my mic.
1929138	1929378	All right.
1930478	1932700	Anyhow, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
1933580	1933820	Nope.
1934140	1934381	All right.
1935101	1935781	My gaming week.
1936762	1941965	I finally, after like weeks and weeks, and I know this is old news to a lot of you, but this is what I've been playing.
1942245	1942765	I played L.A.
1942825	1949789	Noire finally for the first time, which was what I was referring to earlier when I said I was playing a game that felt like playing a movie a little bit.
1950029	1950850	And yeah, L.A.
1950890	1951270	Noire.
1951970	1956111	Wow, I gotta say though, I like it more than I thought I would.
1956151	1960773	I'm not usually super into these Grand Theft Auto games, and certainly there's components of L.A.
1960833	1967915	Noire that kind of feels like, oh, it's Grand Theft Auto in the 40s, but that's really just like the driving around stuff, and a little bit of the combat stuff.
1968215	1974577	I liked the interrogation and the clue finding and all that stuff, even though I am so fucking terrible at interrogations.
1974797	1979979	I can't believe how much I bombed what is supposed to be the easiest fucking case in the game.
1980526	1981307	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2003923	2009546	But, you know, even in the first case where it's so, like, their expressions are, like, over the top.
2009866	2011226	Like, you can really read them.
2011767	2015088	I was, I got every single question wrong my first time.
2015388	2016509	Like, multiple times.
2016689	2018070	Like, I was trying to figure out what's going on.
2018330	2021171	Thankfully, the game didn't be all like, you lose, game over.
2021231	2026994	It just kind of, I just got yelled at repeatedly by the boss and finally I got through it, figured out the right answers.
2027554	2031916	But, um, I liked the expressions and the faces look really...
2033476	2033696	Neat.
2033956	2035437	And the voice acting's well done, too.
2035757	2037517	So, you're laughing over there, Irene.
2037977	2041578	Yeah, I mean, the, you know, faces looked neat.
2041638	2042439	Have you played it at all?
2042959	2045900	I have not played it, but I watched one of our friends play it.
2046080	2047620	And I think it's a stupid game.
2047720	2049021	Why do you think it's stupid?
2049041	2049781	It's corny.
2049921	2052922	It's just, I mean, like, okay, so you chase after a guy.
2053282	2053762	All right.
2054182	2054622	Fun.
2054802	2056163	And then you, like, interrogate.
2056243	2056763	And it's just...
2057483	2067452	It feels unnatural when you're trying to interrogate them and then if you do it wrong that stupid ass sergeant guy just like is crazy and he yells at you like he's a psycho.
2067812	2068112	I don't know.
2068573	2072056	And that just was the point when I tuned out because I didn't care.
2073157	2077421	It's almost like being on a game show because like you find out right away if you fucked up or not.
2077481	2079302	Like you hit the button and right away it just fades up.
2079743	2080263	Incorrect.
2080323	2081644	And you hear a little doo doo doo.
2082065	2084427	And I'm like god damn it.
2085737	2086097	Yeah.
2086217	2087898	And then they'll yell at you like the chicks.
2087958	2088938	I'll get out of my store.
2088998	2089659	You're an asshole.
2089679	2092100	I'm like, but you totally look like you were lying, bitch.
2093680	2095721	Set your store on fire now.
2095841	2100763	See, that's where the game needed more Grand Theft Auto because like, bitch, I'm going to set the store on fire then.
2101143	2106065	But I couldn't do that because you're supposed to be a cop and cops don't set things on fire randomly, you know?
2106265	2106565	Yeah.
2106825	2108526	Eleanor is not Grand Theft Auto.
2109972	2117697	I listened to Dan play the whole thing because I was in here and I was like, wow, this is historically accurate given the dialogue.
2118337	2119638	And then I saw the ending.
2119958	2122179	I'm not going to spoil, but I was like, what?
2123820	2124381	That's the ending.
2125481	2127042	Well, they had to leave it for DLC, I guess.
2127062	2127743	I don't know the ending.
2127783	2128703	No, I'm not going to tell you.
2128743	2130745	I'm just going to say, it's what?
2131725	2132145	When you see it.
2132346	2132606	That's all.
2132866	2133006	Okay.
2133513	2133973	Well, we'll see.
2134053	2134374	I don't know.
2134474	2141037	I have the attention span of a three-year-old, so I don't know if I'll get that far, but I'll probably at least play it a few more times before I return it back to Loki.
2142178	2143499	I've only had it for like two months.
2143519	2145160	What's another month going to hurt?
2145180	2149262	It's funny you say that because a three-year-old was watching me play WoW last night, and she would not stop asking me questions.
2149742	2150003	Really?
2150063	2151203	What kind of questions does a three-year-old ask?
2151223	2152884	I was in Icecrown, too, which was really boring.
2153024	2155286	What kind of questions does a three-year-old ask about World of Warcraft?
2155306	2156266	Are those bad guys?
2156386	2157207	Yes, they're bad guys.
2157527	2158527	I like bad guys.
2158567	2159228	They're strong.
2160845	2164470	I'm like, yeah, but I have to beat up the bad guys so I'm stronger than they are.
2165051	2168856	Oh, well, you're pretty cool too, but that bad guy's a big bug.
2168896	2169957	Do they eat other bugs?
2169977	2171479	Well, you're playing Horde, right?
2171619	2171799	No.
2172060	2172240	No?
2172460	2173141	I'm playing Alliance.
2173522	2174303	Oh, well, then never mind.
2176892	2180134	Also, you have to remember, Horde isn't the bad guys.
2180415	2182416	It's just an alternative lifestyle.
2182456	2185098	No, I don't know what you'd call it.
2185158	2186399	It's just the other faction.
2187620	2190542	Either you're a goat person or you're a cow person.
2190602	2191442	It's just whatever.
2191802	2193404	Space goat, coast to coast.
2194224	2194664	Exactly.
2195345	2196826	Other games I've played this week besides L.A.
2196866	2197146	Noire.
2197227	2207495	I revisited the Wii a little bit this week because if you were listening to the show a couple weeks ago, I hacked my Wii and I have a drive now that I'm loading all my games to, which they're my games.
2207855	2211758	I've been dumping them to the drive just because I can.
2211878	2212239	I don't know.
2212279	2213099	I just thought it would be fun.
2213580	2215321	And now I never have to get up from the couch and...
2217022	2222366	Yeah, it's actually forced me to revisit a lot of old Wii games I haven't played in years.
2222406	2223607	So I'm actually kind of glad I did it.
2223647	2226509	And these are all games I've talked about on the show years and years ago when I first bought them.
2226849	2228790	But I played Geometry Wars for a little while today.
2228810	2232613	Because you know Geometry Wars had the Wii version, but it's really weird because you have to actually point.
2232953	2234634	You don't have two analogs on the Wii, right?
2234874	2239337	So you have one analog and then you actually point on the screen for your other analog.
2239818	2242700	And the nice thing about it, I don't know, it's a different way to control it.
2242860	2243380	It's kind of cool.
2243420	2246202	You can actually just point at the ships and it's, I don't know.
2246882	2251546	But I like that the game had all sorts of different maps, all sorts of different types of modes.
2251607	2252427	It's a fun game.
2253308	2256491	And then I was randomly playing New Super Mario Bros.
2256531	2256971	Wii today.
2257432	2257752	Why?
2258453	2259073	Because I could.
2259493	2259834	And it was...
2261431	2264013	They really just tried to remake Mario 3 with that game, I think.
2265594	2267215	As minimal effort as possible.
2267235	2268616	Well, it's not a bad game, though.
2269256	2269996	No, it's not a bad game.
2270016	2272158	It's actually one of the better games on the Wii.
2272178	2273078	But see, that's the point.
2273399	2276961	The point is you don't have to spend a lot of development money to make a game.
2277041	2284286	You could put out something that's very similar to another game, just change up the levels, and then you don't charge as much.
2286207	2286487	I don't know.
2289384	2295349	Um, so, let's see, what else did I play this week besides revisiting the Wii?
2295529	2295889	Oh, 360!
2296329	2300052	Since that's up and running again, I played Insane Twisted Shadow Planet.
2300072	2304736	Because I was really into that game, and then the Xbox got hacked, and I was pissed off, so I played a little more of that.
2305236	2311401	And it's getting to the point where it's getting a lot harder, but I basically have determined that this is like Metroid, but kind of like more of a puzzler.
2311821	2312622	Which is kind of awesome.
2312942	2314803	So, yeah, Insane Twisted Shadow Planet.
2314903	2316144	I think you would actually really like it.
2316164	2316545	Yeah.
2317265	2318926	Oh, did you try it, Irene?
2319086	2319546	I've tried it.
2319686	2320206	It's okay.
2320387	2322848	That's the one where the robot flies around and he has to use his different app.
2322868	2324148	The spaceship.
2324268	2324469	Yes.
2324649	2325469	Yes, yes, that's it.
2326049	2326970	Yeah, it's all right.
2327050	2327270	Yeah?
2327550	2327750	Yeah.
2327790	2328070	I like it.
2328170	2329271	It's really fun.
2329611	2329791	Yeah.
2330531	2337735	So, I'm in the ice world right now, which supposedly the game's only supposed to take like seven or eight hours to beat, but some of it's like really hard.
2338715	2344138	The difficulty really amped up really fast from the ocean level to the snow level, I noticed, is kind of interesting.
2344158	2344238	Yeah.
2344565	2345346	and I'll see you next time.
2361818	2362058	DarkSakura,
2383803	2384344	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2405642	2423956	uh we will be here back again next week with a show but we will not be here in oh i'm sorry i will not be here in two weeks but i believe they're gonna have a show without me so tune in to hear more on that because i'm going to san francisco and i'm not going to be here in two weeks so i think they're trying to find a guest host or something
2424281	2424881	I want to go with you.
2424901	2426981	I already bought the tickets.
2427021	2427422	I'm sorry.
2428282	2429082	You're expensive.
2430302	2430742	That's okay.
2431982	2433863	I have to thank you on air, by the way.
2434063	2434243	Why?
2434563	2436763	For my present for kitty sitting.
2437263	2440184	Oh, at the Disneyland show we were gone last time.
2440224	2441444	I have a Duffy now.
2441704	2443804	It's a Duffy purse, but he's cute and he lives on my wall.
2444205	2444665	There you go.
2445305	2445845	Glad you like it.
2445905	2450246	Thank you for house-sitting the cats who chewed up the $50 headphones I own while we were gone.
2450306	2451606	Well, someone left them on the floor.
2451886	2452206	I didn't.
2453069	2458131	You know, you don't think, oh, I gotta make sure that the cord isn't dangling a little bit from my desk.
2458331	2461692	Honestly, if I had known, I would have taken care of it.
2461712	2462412	I can't expect you to know.
2463192	2465853	Please tell me that you've watched that trailer that I just linked you to.
2466253	2466933	No, I haven't.
2467633	2468374	What is this all about?
2468394	2470474	This is the brand new trailer for Saints Row the Third.
2470554	2473695	It's highlighting their third gang called the Deckers.
2474155	2476716	Oh boy, alright, let's check this out before we get into the news.
2477616	2478437	You're gonna like this.
2478657	2479637	You may have to buy it.
2480257	2480937	Saints Row the Third.
2480977	2482438	I'm already thinking I have to buy it.
2482478	2483338	I think you should.
2484899	2485839	Alright, I'm looking at trailer.
2485899	2486399	Rate it down.
2486439	2486859	Here we go.
2488240	2491721	I know this makes for great ratings.
2491841	2492681	Oh my god.
2492821	2499163	That punk kid is the cyber god who just crashed your helicopter.
2502096	2508842	they are dressed up in Tron like gear like their jackets are all glowing blue keep watching alright
2528683	2529723	Oh no, keep watching.
2529763	2531324	Okay, they're all racing on cars.
2532244	2532464	Oh no.
2532484	2532744	Oh yes.
2532784	2535425	Oh please tell me they're gonna get on light pipes and shit.
2535465	2540287	Wow, they're not even like trying to hide the fact what inspires this, are they?
2564417	2568841	I can't wait to play this fucking game.
2569001	2572604	How is this at all like the other two games?
2573965	2576087	I'm just confused.
2576167	2580732	Because with Saints Row, they've decided to just say, you know what?
2581012	2581472	Fuck it.
2581492	2583734	We're not even going to just try to be a real game anymore.
2583794	2585576	This is all about excess.
2586036	2587337	This game is just excessive.
2588218	2590159	It's unnecessary and excessive.
2590439	2594882	Each trailer, they go more over the top than the last one.
2595302	2600686	I don't know how you're going to get more over the top than going into a virtual world and fighting stuff Tron style.
2602087	2602947	It's awesome.
2604188	2605509	I want now.
2607130	2635619	TigerClaw in our chatroom also points out the fact that they're called the Deckards is a reference to Blade Runner so it's not just Tron that's inspiring this although visually it's certainly very very Tron-esque so yeah Harrison Ford was Deckard so anyhow here's the thing I'm almost sold on Saints Row 3 but it's also one of those you know what I don't want to buy into trailers just I'm gonna wait for the game to come out see the reviews see Loki's review very important I know he thinks he's gonna love it but
2636079	2659051	I gotta hear, look, dude, dude, what, I was listening to Bobby's show before we were live tonight, right, as I usually do on The Car Ride Over, and Madden came out this past week, which is usually, like, a huge release, apparently Madden has, I mean, I don't really play the Madden games, but I know they're huge, and everybody buys them, and they're very important, very, very high profile games, probably only second to, like, a Call of Duty game
2660672	2675345	and apparently the menus fucking freeze and shit like just basic shit is broken in Madden it sounds like from what I'm hearing it's like there's literally nothing that this game could do to make me not want to buy it I mean there's nothing
2676332	2681135	absolutely nothing and come out and say the next gang is My Little Ponies and I wouldn't fucking care.
2681575	2684697	Although that would probably make me want to buy the game even more because it's so ridiculous.
2684917	2687098	What if you have to play Raiden for the rest of the game?
2687419	2690060	Would you like play it still?
2691241	2691541	Yes.
2691961	2692722	Oh, okay.
2694222	2694823	I don't even understand.
2694843	2695063	What?
2695803	2697604	Wasn't that his name from Metal Gear Solid 2?
2698725	2699486	Oh, okay.
2699566	2699846	I see.
2699886	2700746	Was that his name?
2700906	2701187	Raiden?
2702167	2702487	Yes.
2702767	2703008	Okay.
2703948	2704448	Never mind.
2704669	2705409	Womp, womp, womp.
2708297	2734118	Blackwolf is in chat actually and points out deckers are also the term in Shadowrun for the grid hackers so lots of references that is very true I've played one yes I did play Shadowrun alright well thank you for derailing the show with that trailer it's actually very interesting looking alright let's actually get into the news we were planning on discussing tonight 45 minutes into the show and we'll start off with almost an immediate follow up to something last week that came up at the end of the show right Loki?
2734727	2735389	Dragon Quest X
2743147	2745689	Or at least they're going to make an announcement about Dragon Quest.
2746370	2748792	That announcement was Dragon Quest X Online.
2749252	2750593	It is an online RPG.
2751354	2757199	And it is going to be... I'm not sure if it's still being... It looks like it's still being developed by Level 5.
2758160	2761063	And, of course, they're responsible for Dragon Quest VIII and IX.
2762744	2764326	The game is coming out on the Wii.
2764646	2767208	Also, I guess it's being developed for the Wii U as well.
2768169	2768329	And...
2771195	2777459	I guess they're saying also they're considering the 3DS as some form of character transfers or something like that.
2780001	2787906	It does of course require an internet connection being that it's an online MMO and it's going to require a fee as well.
2788686	2790988	So there's going to be some sort of usage fee for that.
2792849	2795631	It's kind of interesting because there's really no MMOs on the Wii and
2797813	2801616	Considering the Wii's pretty much at the end of its life cycle already, that's kind of weird.
2802357	2809723	Yeah, I gotta admit, we were talking about this briefly on the show last week because the press conference was about to start when we ended the show last week.
2810144	2821113	And so I drive home, I get home, I go into the house, and I fire up my reader to look at what news I missed while the show was going on, and there's an announcement about Dragon Quest X, and I'm like, oh, Dragon Quest X is gonna be online?
2821673	2822214	On the Wii?
2822534	2823195	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
2823775	2828159	Online, Wii, syntax error, I don't understand, how does this compute?
2828860	2830141	You just divided by zero.
2831022	2837888	The Monster Hunter game over there was, I believe, had paid online as well.
2839950	2845613	I'm thinking, though, that this is mainly just going to be a Wii U game, but that they're like, well, you know what, we're going to make it.
2846033	2847534	Since we promised it on the Wii.
2848034	2852936	Let's make a version also for the Wii because, you know, we still have a user base for that.
2852956	2854257	It's like a Zelda-esque type of thing.
2854277	2861780	Because remember, Zelda Twilight Princess was a launch title, but they had to make the GameCube version because they had originally announced it for GameCube, and it was kind of the same hardware.
2861801	2862721	Yeah, really, more like...
2862961	2868377	Oh, it was ready for the GameCube, but they delayed it so they could put it as a Wii launch title.
2868417	2870623	Exactly what they're doing here with Dragon Quest X.
2872156	2872596	It's Momomish
2896431	2898513	Yeah, it's Momo-ish, but it's not... Yeah, I guess.
2898893	2901915	So they would probably have an offline component as well.
2902035	2911962	I don't know if it's going to be online only, but when I hear usage fees and requires the internet, that screams MMO to me.
2912959	2922067	Game Guru in our chatroom says, from the makers of Final Fantasy XIV, from the publishers of Final Fantasy XIV, it is a different studio putting this together, right?
2922087	2926912	Level 5 had nothing to do with Final Fantasy XIV or any Final Fantasy game for that matter that I can think of.
2927412	2929254	So, no, these are different teams.
2929294	2930014	It's important to say.
2930415	2934999	I get your joke, but hopefully the MMO experience doesn't completely suck.
2935599	2946221	or whatever online adventuring experience they come up with, which I'm convinced is going to be more like White Knight Chronicles, which was kind of... That game's really kind of a cult kind of game.
2946281	2950682	It didn't really break through, but there's definitely a player base playing that game.
2951082	2956163	But once again, this also begs one simple question.
2956903	2959464	This game is definitely niche.
2959904	2960164	It is...
2961464	2962305	Very, very niche.
2962325	2964546	You're talking about an online game.
2964706	2966527	First off, an online MMO on the Wii.
2967228	2968589	Not a lot of people are going to bite on that.
2968909	2970770	And it's an RPG.
2971230	2974352	A Japanese-style RPG on the Wii.
2974392	2978755	That's talk about narrowing the user base down quite a bit.
2979735	2985859	And yet, no Last Story or Xenoblade or anything like that over here.
2986840	2988160	But yet, they're going to bring that out.
2988180	2988561	Yeah.
2989401	2993626	DDR Dollar Bill in the chatroom says, explain how you guys define MMORPG.
2994066	3000433	Here's the thing, I mean, obviously it's a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, right?
3000473	3003977	But the reason why Phantasy Star Universe kind of doesn't fall out of that category...
3005338	3006880	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3023453	3026634	Where you can interact with people and then you have the game.
3026674	3029215	You form your parties in the lobby and then you really go play the game.
3029515	3030855	But you have chat.
3031195	3031875	You have voice chat.
3032356	3033556	And that was a big component.
3033656	3034596	But there's nothing else.
3034696	3038878	There's no game component really in those lobbies outside of shops.
3039278	3040138	And playing hockey.
3040298	3041758	There's no PvP.
3042258	3043499	And playing hockey.
3043559	3044499	I don't know.
3045219	3047200	And the giant choo-choo rocket level.
3047600	3048280	I don't know.
3048360	3054583	Well, I think that it better be an MMO because what am I paying for online then for?
3055024	3057065	Because the Wii, it's online and it's free.
3057205	3061207	Why would I have to pay to play a game I just bought online?
3061227	3062747	Because MMOs you pay to play.
3062908	3068430	Well, yeah, MMOs you pay to play, but if it's not an MMO, if we're just talking about a game with some four-player, 16-player online...
3070251	3071953	White Knight Chronicles White Knight Chronicles
3089548	3090228	Thanks for watching!
3109699	3110260	Thank you for watching!
3130462	3135445	and then you totally ignored your hardcore gamer user base in the process.
3135905	3139126	Yeah, that's going to work out really well for you for this next console as well.
3141721	3144563	It's just... I don't think it's going to do very well.
3144863	3148465	I mean, just look at all the other niche hardcore games that have been out there.
3149446	3152368	RPGs and non-RPGs.
3152768	3153809	They just haven't done well.
3154029	3158052	And I understand this is going to be published probably by... I don't know if it's Square Enix.
3158092	3164015	I'm guessing Nintendo because they did the last Dragon Quest game and Dragon Quest Monsters 2 and stuff like that.
3165717	3169359	So if it's published by Nintendo, I mean, there'll be some more marketing behind that, but...
3171224	3172784	It's gonna be tough.
3172884	3174985	Especially convincing people.
3176125	3178185	First off, I don't know.
3178425	3178865	It'll be tough.
3179005	3182146	I just need to really see more of the game before I can really make a call.
3182406	3187267	I gotta play the game, see some reviews, see some trailers that aren't just cutscenes.
3187807	3188287	No, it's not.
3188427	3190808	I mean, I just... Like, I love Dragon Quest VIII.
3190888	3193188	Oh my god, that game was so fucking good on the PlayStation.
3193268	3195709	But, you know, I just... We'll see.
3196949	3197889	Again, if it's worth paying...
3198109	3202651	but it sounds like there's going to be still at least a full single player game and that part I kind of like at least.
3202671	3204252	I mean, Phantasy Star Universe is the same way.
3204272	3221900	Yeah, if it's got that then that's fine and it's worth a purchase because then you don't have to play the online portion of it and if they're going to go the whole Phantasy Star online route then that's fine but it's just if they're going just an MMO route that's going to be a difficult sell.
3222860	3224262	3DS Circle Pad Attachment
3243241	3250848	The 3DS will plug into this kind of, it looks like a docking bay sort of thing that has, yes, another analog stick on the right-hand side.
3251588	3262197	Along with this announcement came an announcement that they are making Monster Hunter Tri-G on the 3DS, which, you know, requires a second analog controller just the way the game is.
3262638	3268403	So now what's kind of confusing is, did they do this circle attachment just to get the Monster Hunter game,
3268903	3270003	or is this the future of the 3DS
3298972	3321370	If I have to... I mean, I don't know if I would play a Monster Hunter game, but if this ends up being the norm, which I worry it could be... They're obviously... I mean, if Nintendo's making a peripheral for this game, and I know Monster Hunter's gonna be big in Japan, if it even comes out over here, if they're making a peripheral for this, you better damn well believe that's gonna be used for something other than just one game.
3321970	3324913	I mean, why even bother if it's gonna be for just one game?
3325593	3327214	And, yeah, as you said...
3328135	3331116	The cost thing, you didn't give me free games because you dropped the price of the system.
3331156	3331556	You know what?
3331596	3332377	You didn't have to do that.
3332417	3335058	Because I understand the price is going to drop.
3335098	3336838	Yeah, it was a little bit sooner than I had thought.
3336918	3337619	But whatever.
3337639	3337999	You know what?
3338019	3339639	That's too well.
3340340	3340620	Whatever.
3340880	3342600	So I bought the system back in March.
3342640	3344661	I had it a few months with no games.
3345221	3349863	And I dropped it, and they gave me some free virtual console games, which I've not played.
3350583	3351764	And that's fine.
3351924	3355025	But this is going to split your user base in half now.
3355405	3374859	Now, this is great, because now everyone thinks that the system is going to be redesigned, whether it is or not, and all the people that are thinking about, hey, I really need to pick up a 3DS this holiday to pick up some Mario and Mario Kart games and stuff like that, and whatever else they have coming for the 3DS, people are going to wait.
3375519	3380120	It's going to be interesting to see what Nintendo says to this press conference because I'm looking at our chatroom, of course, is lighting up on this story.
3380180	3382241	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to join us live.
3383041	3387642	Zether in chat says, as of now, that add-on is only for Monster Hunter Tri-G.
3388162	3395204	And I'm kind of going, okay, yeah, as of now, but there's certainly that skeptic in me that's saying, but now that that's out there, who else might use it?
3395524	3399625	Now granted, just because the peripheral exists doesn't mean everybody's going to use it.
3399705	3404407	Like I think of, okay, that Metroid pinball game had that rumble pack in the DS.
3404467	3405287	Remember that thing?
3405307	3406767	That was a real flash in the pan, right?
3407288	3409188	And I don't think any other games really used it.
3409328	3410829	Yeah, there's a bunch of games that used it.
3410849	3411209	Were there?
3411409	3411529	Yeah.
3412029	3413671	Huh, I always thought there were like one or two.
3413731	3419158	Not a lot, but see that thing right there though, that's not necessary to play the game.
3419438	3421941	Rumble, eh, whatever, so my system doesn't rumble.
3421961	3423102	That's not a big deal.
3423603	3424964	None of them do nowadays anyways.
3426126	3427868	But a second analog stick is kind of important.
3427908	3429149	That's like saying, oh, you know,
3430350	3445275	we added some buttons in fact that does add a couple shoulder buttons to the thing as well and a trigger I think so that's a big deal because now you have dual analogs so you can do first person shooters on that system quite well now
3445815	3446936	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3473252	3482100	and could it be all this call about, gee, what do you mean the system's only going to come with one Wii U controller and we're not going to buy a second controller separately?
3482520	3484562	Could this be the path we're going down?
3484662	3484922	Yep.
3486523	3487624	That's exactly what they're doing.
3487644	3501056	Because you know when that controller first came out, listen to the episodes of OLR leading up to the reveal of the Wii U because it's very interesting because we were theorizing and theorizing and then all of a sudden it just kind of dawned on us that like,
3501716	3508287	Duh, everything we have heard about this was clearly just the Wii U controller is a freaking DS without the top screen.
3508648	3509870	That's what the Wii U controller is.
3510050	3510971	And a few more buttons.
3511512	3513035	Well, here's your few more buttons now.
3513916	3515599	It's very interesting.
3517082	3521804	This Nintendo conference that's coming up tomorrow is going to be very interesting.
3523684	3526645	I just can't wait to hear their rationalization.
3527886	3538410	I want to see if they only announce the Monster Hunter thing for this or if they say a new Pokemon game and the Pokemon game is going to use two analog sticks too because then it's over.
3538470	3539350	All the games are using it.
3540414	3541476	It's not just one game.
3560695	3565200	But at the same time, you should have fucking thought of this when you're designing your system.
3565461	3566061	Hey, I don't know.
3566141	3566602	Let's see.
3567002	3568204	There's the PSP.
3568544	3570626	What was the number one bitch about the PSP?
3570806	3572869	It doesn't have a fucking second analog stick.
3573349	3573830	What'd you think?
3573870	3574450	Hey, you know what?
3574771	3577193	Maybe people want a second analog stick.
3577774	3583098	Huh, could that be possibly what people want since they're saying I want a second analog stick?
3583518	3585099	Nah, that's not what they want.
3585139	3586620	They just want one analog stick.
3586640	3587380	That's what we're going to do.
3587400	3589642	We're just going to leave them with just one analog stick.
3590443	3591123	Oh, damn.
3591403	3594305	You know, a big game comes out that needs a second analog stick.
3595026	3595666	Ah, crap.
3595686	3598148	We better make another adjustment to this.
3598628	3602591	Yeah, I'd be pissed even if it is an accessory or whatever.
3603031	3607014	Not only does it make it, you know, how the fuck am I supposed to carry that around with me now?
3608275	3609556	It's not going to fucking fit in my pocket.
3611277	3621727	Now, again, we have to really wait until after Nintendo makes the official announcement because I think it's still, I mean, even though we have the picture and everything, it's still too early to say what the point of this is.
3621887	3625330	Is this a Monster Hunter add-on or is this, we don't know.
3626131	3630495	But we're all looking at it going, gosh, it makes your 3DS look like a Wii U controller.
3631476	3633858	Yeah, a lot of people want to have that second analog stick.
3634758	3637400	We've heard rumors about a 3DS redesign anyway.
3638601	3639381	It would all add up.
3639421	3640562	This is probably happening.
3640662	3648847	I kind of akin this to – and I see some folks in chat are talking about, well, not every peripheral goes on forever, like the e-reader, printer, and so forth.
3648867	3651448	But I go – and none of these are ever required.
3651468	3654410	But then I go, but what about the Wii Plus motion thing?
3654930	3655810	Wii Motion Plus.
3656370	3659911	Wii Motion Plus didn't come out until later and now it's like if you want to play the new Zelda game you have to have it.
3660371	3664032	It would not be unheard of for Nintendo to require this in the future.
3664052	3667673	This is more along the lines of Wii Motion Plus than it is the e-reader.
3668313	3671854	Those are all gimmicky things that weren't necessary like the Rumble Pack.
3672054	3674735	That's not necessary to play a DS game.
3674835	3675735	It was just a gimmicky thing.
3675755	3677916	The e-reader was actually a really kind of cool idea.
3677956	3680956	It was a cool idea but it was still a gimmick.
3680996	3682677	You could have done something else to...
3683837	3687718	How awesome was it to have an old school NES game on five cards in your pocket?
3687818	3689239	That was kind of cool, I'm sorry.
3690039	3695080	Yeah, it's pretty cool, but at the same time, though, this is another analog stick.
3695140	3697461	This is adding another joystick.
3697481	3700201	This is very significant.
3701662	3703182	And it's a few extra buttons on there.
3703602	3706403	Which, by the way, is kind of interesting now that I think of it.
3706983	3710804	It's probably going to use that IR port that's on the back of that fucking 3DS.
3710984	3712905	Everyone's like, what the hell is this IR port for?
3714239	3714620	Great.
3715420	3719224	But it's just... Alright.
3720105	3722107	We've got more stories to talk about.
3722127	3725250	The 3DS and... Let me bring some of these up real quick.
3725270	3728833	3DS, obviously the price cut happened and a lot of you are very happy about it.
3728893	3730074	How many of you are happy about it?
3730795	3733818	Over 260% are buying this now than were before 3DS.
3735479	3741760	3DS sold 185,000 units between the price cut and the month's end.
3741820	3745841	That's a 260% increase over that same time period in July.
3745921	3752442	So it does mean that this has motivated sales a little more, and this is a trend that's going to continue through Christmas, guaranteed.
3753003	3758904	I still think, especially now that the Vita's not around this Christmas, this thing's going to sell like crazy over the holidays.
3760244	3767089	Despite all this other crap we're talking about, soccer moms don't know about... Soccer moms are not reading Famitsu magazine in Japan.
3767770	3772853	I honestly think that the whole thing with the 3DS was really very carefully planned.
3773434	3779298	They knew they didn't have a good thing out quite yet, but at least at the higher price anyway with the intention of dropping the price.
3779638	3780779	Because they knew it would...
3782304	3784126	I mean, sales would happen after a price drop.
3784326	3785527	I don't think so.
3785687	3792072	I kind of actually disagree because I think Nintendo saw the reception at E3 and was like, holy shit, we've struck gold with this thing.
3792092	3793213	We've got to get it out now.
3793534	3795735	And they put it out in some ways too soon.
3796136	3800840	But where I will hear is that I think the strategy all along was a build-up to Christmas.
3801180	3806304	I think they released it at the end of the fiscal year to pad the low sales of Wii and then it's going to just...
3807225	3810747	The price drop, on the other hand, I don't think that was planned.
3810927	3814928	No, because if they were planning on doing it, well, no one plans on dropping the price of that.
3815028	3817149	I mean, they've got to be selling it at a loss now.
3817830	3826193	And if they weren't selling it at a loss and they had that much of a margin in there, they could have fit a second fucking analog stick in there.
3826213	3829154	I mean, an analog stick doesn't cost hardly anything.
3829194	3832076	It's maybe $10 to put in that system.
3833061	3833922	I doubt it's even $10.
3834823	3836706	I've bought replacements for my PSP.
3836746	3839329	The 3DS production cost is $101 per unit.
3839590	3839670	Wow.
3839690	3840251	So, including overhead...
3847305	3848586	They're probably still pulling a profit on it.
3848726	3853608	So they could have charged 10 extra dollars in what they're charging now and added a second analog stick all along.
3853908	3854528	And you know what?
3855269	3856169	Hey, guess what, Nintendo?
3856369	3860291	It's a good thing to have things on your system, like say a second analog stick.
3860711	3861452	Yeah, you know what?
3861492	3866674	You may not have a use for it right now, but publishers would probably want that.
3867554	3869515	It makes development of games a little bit easier.
3869675	3873097	Instead of having to do some funky right analog stick using the touchscreen.
3873331	3874012	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3897711	3898432	and it's not dead.
3899112	3899913	It's far from it.
3900033	3905696	They've just announced that on September 18th there will be a metallic rose DSiX.
3905756	3906517	It's fucking pink.
3906797	3910520	It's a fucking pink DSi and it's coming out on September 18th.
3910720	3911560	I kind of want it.
3912301	3916704	In the same way that I wanted my pink Advance that I have the Afterburner in.
3917484	3918345	I kind of want this now.
3918405	3919486	I mean, you know, whatever.
3919606	3921427	The DSiX, you know, the screens are really big.
3921467	3922448	It's kind of nice, whatever.
3922488	3925350	But it is weird that it's the same price as the 3DS.
3926210	3927131	That's a little weird to me.
3928212	3929953	DS Lights, by the way, are still on shelves.
3929973	3931114	There's a really pretty blue one.
3932575	3933796	99 bucks for DS Light.
3935998	3936899	It's interesting to me.
3939501	3939702	Huh.
3940102	3940422	Alright.
3940883	3941984	I don't get empty.
3942404	3942704	You know what?
3942904	3946548	These people that buy these, you know, this pink system that's coming out, same price as the 3DS...
3948482	3950505	You deserve all those high-priced games and shit.
3950585	3958436	Alright, well, we're gonna revisit all of this again next week because the Nintendo press conference is happening in a couple days and who knows what curveballs are gonna come out of that.
3958817	3962101	There could be that... I mean, if a Pokemon game is announced...
3963018	3964939	They already have a Pokemon game.
3965099	3966340	What Pokemon game?
3966420	3967161	Not 3D.
3968702	3969002	I'm sorry.
3969162	3973605	Yes, they have a Pokemon, but it's like Pokemon Snap.
3973945	3976026	Pokemon Snap is not really a Pokemon game.
3976086	3977407	You know what I mean?
3977467	3979348	They need a Pokemon Magenta.
3980329	3983451	There's no Pokemon game that's going to need a second analog stick.
3986252	3987633	Maybe you just haven't thought of it yet.
3987653	3988914	A Pokemon first-person shooter.
3989074	3990775	That would be all sorts of lame.
3991416	3992297	No, that would be awesome.
3992437	3992857	Are you kidding?
3992877	3993998	No, it would be stupid.
3995956	3997817	Pokemon First Person Shooter.
3998077	4000179	Wasn't that pretty much Pokemon Snap?
4000539	4001139	Pretty much.
4001159	4004542	Because you're shooting from a first person perspective.
4004902	4005482	Oh, get out.
4005502	4006103	You know what?
4006203	4007283	No, I agree.
4007463	4008564	It was a first person shooter.
4008944	4014668	You just shot photos of them and not, you know, shooting them dead with bullets into their, you know, cute little fuzzy heads.
4015388	4018991	I'm just saying Goldeneye would have been that much better if it was Pikachu killing people.
4019131	4019571	Just saying.
4022293	4024394	Anyhow, let's move on.
4024835	4025435	DarkSakura.
4025899	4026740	How about Crytek?
4027441	4028041	Fail!
4030223	4037411	One of their, I guess, former employees decided that they were going to go off on Tumblr.
4037771	4043296	There's an anonymous account, which I took the liberty of reblogging everything on our Tumblr.
4043697	4044257	Hint, hint, hint.
4044358	4046159	OrangeLoungeRadio.tumblr.com
4047501	4056130	and basically is listing this whole just crazy line of stuff that they've done that's illegal.
4057411	4060434	Going over this, he said, I'm going to read a little bit.
4060855	4069163	From the outside, Crytek produces some of the most graphically pleasing games around, those being Far Cry, Crysis, Crysis, Warhead, and Crysis 2, 4 games in 10 years.
4070024	4075208	The work of the individual responsible, the individual should be proud of what they've done.
4075908	4088417	But they basically said that there's a bullying mentality given at the CEO levels where they're delivered lines like, you should be proud to work for Crytek yet demanding six months of crunch time due to project management failures.
4089077	4092820	This caused certain members of staff to suffer both in medical and personal ways.
4093340	4111433	and he's listing, alright, the splitted the work atmosphere that resulted in the resignation and or unlawful firing of global talent manager, global head of resourceful humans, lead game designer, lead community manager, community manager, lead researcher, storyboard and concept artist and a whole list of developers and designers.
4113150	4130200	and so basically the article you know he's just there on Tumblr pretty much blasting them I mean nothing really specifically listed just said that a lot of senior staff was made redundant and that employees were quote allowed to work longer hours and weekend days
4130760	4134061	which, again, Crytek's a German developer in violation of German law.
4136062	4151227	Now, the co-founder, Avni Yerli, said, and he spoke with Develop about these practices and said that they were misleading accusations and, quote, is very distressing for us to think that an individual thinks we've been treating them unfairly.
4151287	4152288	It's very disappointing.
4152848	4155429	So I actually found a rebuttal on the same Tumblr.
4157632	4184253	and he goes on saying as previously mentioned we do not aim to mislead or give erroneous opinions as this would ultimately decrease the strength on which the blog was first created and it is nothing but bring into doubt the levels of truth featured within so he said if German labor codes were being met and strictly adhered to there would be no need for the successful court cases against Crytek GmbH in which a company lawyer was present
4185094	4190838	Crytek, if you can provide proof that no one has ever successfully claimed compensation due to an illegal firing, then please do so.
4191218	4191658	You cannot.
4193179	4194500	And so basically just going on.
4194960	4196501	You can read this all if you want to.
4196541	4197662	I've linked them both on our Tumblr.
4198382	4201744	But it really goes long.
4201824	4204906	And he's talking just... This is clearly somebody who was there.
4206727	4211490	It's one of those cases where I think you go, okay, you read this and you go, well...
4212059	4214440	Another person complaining about the development industry.
4214480	4215221	What a shock.
4215401	4216461	It's probably true.
4217022	4222124	But then you look at it and you go, well, he probably does have a lot of bitterness issues.
4222224	4223525	Obviously something happened there.
4223645	4225006	None of this reads like anyone bitter.
4225206	4228448	I just, I still think the answer's probably in the middle somewhere.
4228988	4233350	It's probably, you know, and I think I just said this two weeks ago on the show on a very similar story.
4233870	4238893	There's your side of the story, my side of the story, and the truth somewhere in the middle.
4239173	4240534	It's probably what's happening here too.
4241400	4244723	Well, there's another line on here, though, that I think is a very good point.
4244923	4247885	Enforcing weekend work and expecting them to come in are two different things.
4248445	4254930	As an employee, you know that if you aren't showing the drive and ambition to become a team player, your direct line manager may take a negative stance on your progression in the company.
4255510	4265878	So basically, it's talking about the impact it has on home life, on employee well-being, which is actually something that I think is a big problem here in the U.S., to be perfectly honest.
4266699	4266919	But...
4269022	4271083	I really don't read any bitterness into any of this.
4271103	4284768	This is someone who loved his job or her job and was proud of the work that they did and found that the entire, just from reading the whole thing, found that the work environment is what soured it.
4285668	4289710	They're very proud of their work, very proud of what they did, but it was all environmental.
4291380	4295982	We'll be interesting to see if this anonymous person is forced to reveal themselves later on or what happens.
4296222	4297483	I just want to end it with the last line.
4298303	4304046	We make and made great games and we just want to see the atmosphere and blatant disregard for employee morale improve.
4305846	4306167	Alright.
4307467	4308067	More power to you.
4308247	4308588	Good luck.
4308908	4309408	Let's move on.
4310054	4310354	All right.
4312115	4317418	So we talked a little bit about Ubisoft and their different DRM that they're going to have for upcoming games.
4317998	4326603	One of the first ones that was going to take place on console was this new Uplay Passport thing that they were doing with Driver San Francisco.
4328114	4330836	The problem was it didn't quite go as planned.
4331696	4341883	Driver San Francisco on Xbox 360 was supposed to include a Uplay passport code required to access multiplayer beyond a 48-hour trial period.
4342924	4348828	However, they forgot to put the codes in many of the copies that went out.
4351329	4351950	Brilliant work.
4352250	4362474	Yes, so what ended up happening, and this is only really in North America, what ended up happening, though, is the people that bought it, you can actually get the passport for free.
4362895	4365596	You just either sign in, and there's two options.
4365636	4376760	There's one to start my two-day free trial, which will not expire now, or select Uplay Passport Purchase, which will be provided at no charge.
4377121	4377281	So,
4378081	4385136	If you wanted to right now, you could purchase that game for used or whatever and still get online for free.
4386018	4387381	Because they fucked up.
4387621	4389204	So basically the whole thing just went out the window.
4389918	4391459	Yes, on the Xbox 360 at least.
4391519	4400121	Still going on the PlayStation 3 because they didn't forget in that one, but Xbox 360 at least they forgot.
4400141	4402382	Well, that's nice and fair.
4402982	4404683	And surprisingly, the game got pretty good reviews.
4405083	4408084	I didn't think it would be that well, but it did all right.
4409005	4416913	Also, FromDust on PC had that wonderful online, you have to be always online in order to play the game.
4417273	4419796	Well, now they have a patch that removes that DRM.
4420477	4423620	So the title can be played in offline mode as well now.
4426395	4429077	I guess a follow-up to that had come up a couple weeks ago.
4429137	4434300	I know that some people were pissed that an extra layer of DRM was added to the Steam version.
4435041	4435601	Not cool.
4437703	4444827	Alright, well, moving on to a story about Xbox and some bans going on on Xbox Live.
4445228	4455975	Apparently, Xbox has actually put out a statement this week that they did ban quite a few users this week and it was a result of theft was the keyword they used.
4456956	4462981	The company, quote, discovered users who were illegitimately accessed Xbox Live Marketplace downloadable content.
4463341	4469426	This access was intentional and not accidental, constituting a blatant violation of the terms of use for the service.
4469766	4473509	But they won't give any more specifics about what's going on.
4473569	4479954	I guess it's known around the internet that there are some ways that you can steal the stuff and Microsoft has finally clamped down on it.
4479974	4483037	It's not entirely stealing, but yeah, there is a way.
4483993	4485714	What do you mean it's not entirely stealing?
4485774	4487836	I wonder if somebody did that when my account was hacked.
4503567	4504867	And I'll see you next time.
4527734	4528835	At least I think that's how it works.
4528875	4529315	Never tried it.
4529395	4533336	I want to say that there's got to be some type of hack that goes there.
4533376	4550682	For instance, when my 1360 red-ringed and I had to get another, I put on the hard drive with all my old games on it, and if I wasn't connected to the internet, my game would show up as a demo at first, but then it would turn into the real game after I was signed in.
4551642	4556708	So I think something happens there where it's just the demo version, but when Xbox Live talks to it.
4557028	4558770	So I'm not sure how they're pulling that off.
4558790	4561253	There's got to be something a little shady there.
4561994	4568882	I was hoping at first that this meant they caught the people that were stealing all the people's money, but I guess it doesn't sound like that.
4568942	4570824	And Microsoft still has not said anything about that.
4570844	4571504	No, they, in fact...
4572065	4572726	DarkSakura.com
4587903	4590486	Alright, so this is one of those cases where you don't want to share.
4592187	4598772	Majinomicon in our chat says, I wonder if that also applies to the Free Fable 2 glitch that happened a few months ago.
4599433	4600674	I seem to remember that.
4600734	4601855	I don't think so.
4602195	4610803	No, because that was a legitimate mistake on Microsoft's part that a lot of people went in and just took advantage of, but at the end of the day, that was Microsoft's fault for leaving that switch open.
4610843	4614506	People weren't hacking their consoles or going around to get it.
4615046	4616407	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4638024	4640525	Okay, the next story actually has to do with Pinball FX.
4641306	4645248	This is the developer says that Microsoft is pretty okay in their book.
4645848	4652131	Basically, it's kind of putting down on Team Meat for what they said, putting down Microsoft.
4653432	4658714	And there's a quote on here from Mel Kirk, who is Zen Studio's Vice President of Marketing.
4659154	4661636	It says, they totally have the right to talk about it.
4661716	4665657	It's terrible they had a bad experience like that, but where we're coming from, when is enough enough?
4665718	4666438	Let it go already.
4666898	4671645	So basically, they're just like, why are you trying to put them down?
4671685	4679194	We're not trying to discredit that you've had a bad time from this, but that it's time to get over it, time to move on.
4680276	4682519	And so they're apparently sniping back and forth like children.
4684460	4685500	It was interesting to read.
4685980	4690341	I don't know if the tweets are still up, but they're archived around on the internet somewhere, I'm sure.
4690881	4694182	It was really one of those cases where I read it and I went, really?
4694242	4699183	People don't think more about the fact that everybody is watching these two companies fight?
4699383	4702964	It wasn't very flattering for either one, I think.
4703344	4707425	It's like anybody who fights on Twitter or on Facebook or whatever.
4707785	4712286	Emotions are running high, so you don't think before you click post, and then later you sort of regret it.
4713166	4721689	But it was nice to see that it all ended with a, you know, how about a super meat boy skin for pinball or whatever they had said at the end that they kissed and made up and cuddled.
4722169	4729471	Well, yeah, well, it even says on here that, you know, they're like good for them.
4729491	4730371	They had a good time.
4730631	4732212	You know, that's great for them.
4733669	4733849	Right.
4734229	4735890	I mean, that's what the meat boy people said.
4736670	4742332	So, I mean, it's working on the end, but it did seem kind of- Well, you should have seen the tweets, because the tweets were the equivalent of, fuck you, you fucking fuck.
4742552	4744393	Like, that's really how they read to me.
4744753	4744913	Oh.
4745734	4746634	Like I said, children.
4747014	4747214	Yeah.
4747554	4751556	So, but it's like someone smacked them on the hand and said, now make nice.
4752096	4755139	Well, just the internet went... You guys look dumb right now.
4756160	4757721	And they're two great games, too.
4758221	4761444	I love both those games, Pinball FX 2 and Meat Boy, so it's kind of sad.
4761504	4764467	It's like watching your friends fight and you're just sitting there helpless.
4764487	4765508	You can't do anything about it.
4765908	4766589	I know how that feels.
4767890	4768390	There you go.
4769671	4770372	Alright, let's move on.
4770412	4773495	Travel the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out
4774386	4775647	Loki, let's start in the U.S.
4793544	4797486	White Knight Chronicles 2 is coming out this week as well.
4797526	4800907	That also includes the first game that's on PlayStation 3.
4815874	4832610	Camping Mama Outdoors Adventure on Nintendo DS Yes, she is still making games about different things other than cooking New Cooking Mama though coming out later this year Thor God of Thunder on the 3DS It was basically the same version as the ones back in May but now for the 3DS
4833471	4857748	DECA Sports Extreme coming out for the 3DS, Bit.Trip Saga, which is the collection of all the Bit.Trip games that's on the 3DS this week as well Puzzler Mind Gym on 3DS, Bit.Trip Complete, which is on the Wii, and that also includes the soundtrack for the game as well Call of Juarez the Cartel on PC, Red Orchestra 2, Heroes of Stalingrad on PC
4859348	4877533	Nicktoons MLB, that's on the Xbox 360, Wii, and DS The God of War Origins Collection on PS3 coming out this week Puka Power Up, that's on Nintendo DS Aren't Pukas the little guys in Dig Dug?
4878234	4882795	Oh, no Oh, Puka P-U-C-C, I was thinking P-O-O-K-A
4883547	4884488	Silly English language!
4884528	4884728	Mm-hmm.
4895432	4900155	Emily the Strange, Strangerous on the Nintendo DS.
4900495	4902617	There's some dual packs coming out for the PSP.
4902637	4903818	I was unaware of here.
4904018	4905199	Mega Man Dual Pack.
4905339	4912303	I believe that's Mega Man Pirate Legends and Mega Man... There was a Mega Man X game as well.
4913544	4914345	That's on PSP.
4914725	4916466	Then Monster Hunter Freedom Dual Pack.
4916566	4919568	That's the two Monster Hunter Freedom games that were out on the PSP over here.
4922210	4923431	And that is it.
4925971	4928512	Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there.
4928952	4933773	On the Xbox 360 on September 15th, Dunamis 15 is coming out.
4933813	4939555	That is not a series I recognize over here, but it is an adventure game that's coming out on the 15th.
4941255	4947476	I don't think it's actually the 15th game in a series, but you do get bikini-clad anime girls as part of it.
4947596	4949257	Actually, she's like wearing a little bra.
4949997	4950657	They're kind of cute.
4951238	4952419	I don't know what type of game this is.
4952479	4953820	Probably another type of sim game.
4953840	4956261	But it looks like it has these mystery elements.
4956401	4956762	I don't know.
4957082	4960084	I need to stop trying to guess what these games are because I'm probably getting it horrifically wrong.
4960384	4961385	But it is kind of fun to guess.
4962525	4964627	Otherwise, though, probably not a game we're going to get over here.
4965507	4967409	So that's really it on the 360 this week.
4967449	4971772	Going to the PlayStation 3, they're getting that same game, and that's really it on the PlayStation 3.
4972552	4974774	There's some more stuff coming next week, just so you guys know.
4976475	4979637	And then going to the handhelds real quick.
4982318	4985259	Trying to pull up the PSP releases here.
4985800	4988381	God Eater Burst gets a price reduction.
4988721	4995024	Otherwise, as far as new games go, there's Gekka Rioran Romance comes out from Idea Factory this week.
4995764	4996645	And this game...
4998847	5000788	It looks like it could be based off an anime.
5001429	5002129	I'm not sure.
5002970	5005372	I just know one of these screenshots says, Dessert.
5005552	5007274	Prohibited fruits scenario.
5007734	5010737	So apparently, there's no no fruits in this game.
5012618	5012838	DarkSakura!
5032788	5037230	Well, in other news, this is, of course, coming out in the UK.
5037950	5042532	On the 13th, we have Hard Reset and Red Orchestra, Heroes of Stalingrad.
5043333	5049195	And on the 14th, we have From Dust, Radiant Silver Gun for Xbox Live Arcade, Renegade Ops, Trackmania 2.
5049916	5051476	And on the 15th, Moto Heroes.
5053617	5054078	Alrighty.
5054318	5058119	Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we got the classic game of the week.
5058219	5059180	But first, Loki.
5059679	5059859	Yes.
5061000	5066345	Infinity Ward is going to get their day in court next year in May on the 7th.
5067506	5073851	This is, of course, the whole trial where they were suing Activision for royalties unpaid.
5073892	5083540	They're seeking $125 million in unpaid royalties from the sales of Modern Warfare 2 and also wish to reclaim their contractual rights to the Modern Warfare brand.
5084781	5085662	Thank you for watching!
5101644	5103645	That's going to be me while this thing's in the courtroom.
5103665	5110388	Because even though this isn't a series I'm a big, huge fan of, I'm excited to see somebody do battle with Activision.
5110428	5111269	It's going to be interesting.
5112409	5112909	Any bets?
5114170	5115571	We should place bets on the courtroom.
5115591	5118092	I don't think they're going to get... They probably will get their royalties.
5118212	5120533	I don't know if they're going to get the Modern Warfare 2 stuff.
5120613	5122974	And even if they did, they'd just rename the damn franchise.
5123534	5124695	It'll still be the same thing, though.
5125135	5127116	Call of Heroes.
5127136	5128257	No, it'll still be Call of Duty.
5128317	5130778	It'll just be... You know...
5131565	5134748	Modernized Warnis or something.
5136369	5137430	Warfare Modern.
5138410	5139051	Exactly.
5140232	5143574	Well, Sony created a new job this week.
5143694	5153402	They hired a chief information security officer, which probably makes sense considering, oh, you know, they had that huge information breach earlier this year when their system got hacked.
5153762	5156724	Well, they're not fucking around with who they've hired for the position.
5157145	5158826	They have hired a former U.S.
5158926	5160287	Homeland Security official.
5160347	5160868	It's Philip
5161408	5188606	Titanjer is the new chief information security officer at PlayStation Network no word as to exactly what that person does however what I'm assuming is that he's going to make sure that system never gets hacked again because if it does get hacked again they'll probably hire someone new instead so yep apparently he's not just that but he's also going to be a senior vice president so I imagine he'll have a say in some of the higher level goings-ons of the companies so
5189006	5192468	He will be reporting to an executive VP in the company.
5193028	5206436	And of course, Sony is making no really holdbacks saying that they are confirming that it's because of the PSN breach saying, quote, we are looking to bolster our network security even further.
5207256	5209998	So they are going to make sure that doesn't happen again.
5210698	5214380	Because if it does happen again, it's going to be really, really bad for everybody.
5215905	5224432	Alright, let's go back to a simpler time when the systems weren't being hacked and our credit card information wasn't saved on the console.
5224712	5227634	Remember when we had consoles and we didn't have to put our credit cards right on?
5227874	5231297	Remember when your consoles didn't have the memory capacity to save anything?
5231377	5232057	Exactly.
5232438	5238302	Well, I think this week's classic game did have a memory capacity of some sort, but it was about 16 blocks big.
5238322	5238943	That was it.
5238963	5239043	Yeah.
5242085	5242405	DarkSakura.com
5264529	5269715	Kind of on purpose, but this morning's conversation over breakfast really inspired.
5269935	5273319	So what is the classic game of the week that surprisingly has never come up before?
5273600	5274421	Final Fantasy VII.
5277304	5280868	Final Fantasy VII came out, well it started development in 1994.
5280928	5284252	And it was supposed to be on the SNES and then to the Nintendo 64.
5286093	5291997	But when PlayStation came out, they hopped right on it because the Nintendo 64 couldn't handle the storage.
5294438	5300861	It was designed and produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi, and the music was by Uematsu Uchiyono.
5300901	5305424	But this was the first one that Yoshitaka Amano didn't do the character designs for.
5305924	5308406	It was done by Tetsuya Nomura.
5309786	5314111	So, uh, this is one of my favorite games of all time, for the record, I'll say.
5314951	5325542	Um, so basically, you're this emo boy named Cloud with his hair in his face, and, uh, he goes around being pissed off and not so talkative, and he runs into this whole bag named Aerith.
5327223	5327864	Tifa, Vincent
5342597	5342997	And Yuffie?
5343157	5343878	Yuffie was fun?
5344038	5345639	And she had, like, the conformer?
5346219	5350783	Can I for real say, the first time I played through this game, I never got Vincent.
5351103	5355286	I didn't even know he was in the game, because I didn't... The internet wasn't really around in the back then.
5355306	5357227	I mean, it was, but nobody used it like they do now.
5357607	5365632	You know, and it's... I didn't have Vincent, and I had Aerith in my party as one of, like, my main people that I would constantly use.
5366053	5368754	So let's just say I wasn't happy by the time this two rolled around.
5368935	5370976	I was legit... Like, I wasn't sad.
5371076	5371716	I was fucking mad.
5373157	5375639	I have my save file still where she dies.
5375939	5378401	Spoiler, she gets ganked by Sephiroth.
5379622	5382163	A lot of people were pissed off and sad.
5382203	5384605	Look at Aerith.
5384785	5386286	She's a man-stealing ho-bag.
5386586	5391910	Aerith dies is kind of like the video game equivalent of Darth Vader as Luke's father.
5391970	5393091	He kills Dumbledore.
5393111	5394171	We all fucking know.
5394632	5394912	Yeah.
5396293	5399715	But at any rate, it's one of my favorite games.
5400255	5402297	I bred Chocobos like you would not believe.
5402777	5408999	Yeah, you can breed chocobos and you race them and if you get the black chocobo it can run over the mountains.
5409459	5415181	You can get another one that runs over the oceans and then you can get the gold chocobo that runs over everything and then you get the airship.
5416021	5416482	And, uh...
5417842	5428568	There's, you know, all the little drama, the little side stories, especially with Vincent, the whole Lucretia thing, being Sephiroth's mom and a bunch of crap.
5429248	5431730	But this game has some of my favorite music in it, too.
5431790	5433651	Rob, you should totally play.
5434951	5440434	Sure, we'll go back from the battle sound there and check out, let's see, you marked this as your favorite song.
5440674	5441615	This is my favorite in the game.
5444737	5445417	Just a little bit of it.
5447695	5449716	This is the first Jenova battle theme.
5450376	5452937	This is like my favorite music in the whole damn game.
5453797	5456458	And then my second favorite is actually more Jenova music.
5456838	5459639	The one that basically takes the battle theme and kind of redoes it.
5460360	5460860	If you don't mind.
5461080	5462020	Sure, I'll go to that too.
5462320	5462801	Let's see.
5463121	5466162	And then I'll keep going with... Here we go.
5466182	5466542	Here's a clip.
5471191	5474372	It takes it so minimalist and then just makes it super dramatic.
5477513	5479354	Anyway, so you've got all these other characters.
5479734	5481035	You've got Barret, who cusses.
5481875	5484596	And Sid, who has the best line in the whole game.
5484616	5487437	It's, sit down in your chair and drink your goddamn tea.
5488477	5512670	which ended up being quoted in like AOL chats for years and years and years and of course there's Red13 who is a kind of a lion-y looking guy and Katshi which for the record that is how it's pronounced because it's Celtic it's not Kate Sith it's Katshi so I'll let you know I'm muddying the whole internet now I love Kate Sith what are you talking about who ends up being like a Turk controlling the body and everything
5513400	5517762	Um, so yeah, this, and of course, you know, there's Sephiroth, because, you know, Sephiroth is what you got.
5518102	5520343	And by the way, the story still makes no fucking sense to this day.
5520483	5521004	Yes, it does.
5522124	5540492	Okay, because basically, it's like the whole Shinra, the big corporation in charge, is sucking the life dry out of the planet, and they're using the energy to do genetic experiments, and they're using, they find this alien thing that lands, and they're using that in their experiments too, hence Sephiroth, who's fucking crazy gonuts.
5541413	5541933	So anyway...
5543408	5549392	He, uh, he decides he's gonna do what Jenova came to do, and that's destroy every fucking thing.
5549872	5550913	And Aerith's like, uh-uh, bitch.
5551733	5553534	Even though, you know, she's a hobag.
5554215	5554375	What?
5559676	5560837	I got corrected by my husband.
5560857	5563718	Dan came in and said, sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.
5564059	5566860	Yes.
5567240	5571983	Which, by the way, I did do a little bit of a double take the first time I was playing through this game and the game said shit.
5572043	5573724	I was like, they can do that in games now?
5574205	5574605	Apparently.
5575125	5576006	Welcome to the PlayStation.
5576026	5576126	Right?
5578068	5585272	So, at any rate, for a little bit more in the development side of that, basically, there are a lot of people involved in this.
5585312	5586873	This is a really big deal.
5588193	5593696	It was designed on Power Animator and Softimage 3D, which is early 3D.
5594236	5596097	Ooh, this is before my kids.
5597798	5601360	You know, before you could just download 3D software, you know, for fun.
5602191	5612154	And, uh, but they, the story was pretty much, um, pretty much how, what they had in mind for the Famicom, but they were able to develop it a lot more and bring the 3D in.
5613095	5616195	Um, they also included, um, previews of other games.
5616436	5623658	Um, basically the demo disc was a pack-in with Tobal number one in Japan, which Tobal number one was also a good game.
5624495	5626997	and I had previews of Bushido Blade and Saga Frontier.
5628378	5629880	And there were just lots of cool stuff.
5629900	5642230	There was a PC version that came out on Windows, but it was really, when it came out for systems at the time, it was really requirement heavy.
5642791	5645733	It really pushed systems and it played really slow.
5645873	5647615	It was molasses.
5648727	5657471	Although now I've found that people have done different patches for them where they have the Advent Children thing.
5657671	5663113	There's a whole Advent Children remake using the Final Fantasy VII PC version.
5664053	5665334	They've re-skinned, re-musiced.
5666294	5668515	They've done HD versions.
5668655	5669416	It's pretty crazy.
5669776	5675218	And then I saw someone actually going through and using the Unreal Engine to re-render whole scenes.
5675919	5691059	and I was hoping that someone was like there's a fan remake project out there too but they haven't really put anything concrete out there so I was really disappointed with that but I mean you've heard the music it's fantastic I've got the soundtrack it's wonderful
5692000	5699342	Now there's a few things about this game that I got an old, I have a strategy guide that was based off the Japanese version.
5700082	5702642	So I really wanted to play the Japanese version for a while.
5703363	5707524	And so I finally got to borrow my friends and there's this little thing, I was telling you about it this morning, Rob.
5708324	5711984	These little things called Test Zero that look like blocky Dobermans.
5712665	5718426	And if you go into the Gold Saucer in the prison and go in the well, they hide out in the well, there's three of them, it's a random encounter.
5719186	5736113	and if you keep attacking them and attacking and attacking and attacking and attacking they will they'll just beg for their life the whole time and then when you kill them you get like a million experience so you can like power level but it's not in the US one I tried not in the US one
5737133	5740954	There were... This was in the days of dex files.
5741575	5746376	You know, when you had the dex drives and you could download the memory card data.
5748317	5754159	I always got the Tifa date because I hated Aerith, but I downloaded a save file that had all the other dates.
5754519	5756940	You could do a date with Aerith, the Hobag.
5757340	5759740	You could do a date with Barret and a date with Yuffie.
5760221	5762381	The Barret date was just funny.
5762581	5763242	Total bromance.
5763502	5763742	Anyway...
5765683	5768145	And you play the whole game to find out that Cloud's fucking nuts.
5769145	5770366	And Sephiroth is even crazier.
5771267	5772148	And Aerith is dead.
5772908	5773829	Which is the best part of the game.
5776551	5781234	But yeah, there's been rumors of Squeenix doing a remake.
5781694	5784937	And there's people who said they would love to dedicate the time to it.
5785217	5787879	To do it with the Final Fantasy XIII style.
5787899	5789240	So basically doing it in Unreal Engine.
5790660	5792501	There are other games related to the series.
5792521	5798004	There's Crisis Core, which is basically the tale of Zax and Chibi Cloud.
5799445	5803327	And there's Dirge of Cerberus, which is a shooting game.
5803827	5810530	Well, kind of first-person shooter-y, starring Vincent, which I sadly have but have not yet set down to play.
5812371	5813932	There were the phone games.
5814412	5814793	Remember?
5814893	5815733	What was it?
5816493	5817094	After Crisis?
5817114	5817194	Yeah.
5818195	5818736	Before Crisis.
5818756	5820758	Before Crisis, that was it, yeah.
5820798	5822500	It was before Crisis.
5824102	5829208	And then there's the Advent Children Complete, the DVD thing, which is awesome.
5829749	5835335	And actually the ending song has a cameo by Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance.
5835395	5835776	Just thought I'd...
5836169	5837591	Only in the Japanese version, which is stupid.
5837691	5838031	But anyway.
5840074	5841095	Just one of the best games ever.
5841115	5848363	And of course, Amano went back and did a lot of special art as promotional material for Final Fantasy VII.
5849504	5850025	So, uh...
5852723	5856184	The only ones that I have of those are what's in my huge mungus Amano art book.
5856665	5857985	But you can find them online.
5858005	5858405	They're out there.
5859325	5861186	And so that's Final Fantasy VII.
5861406	5866128	It's considered... I mean, I think VI was a more solid game.
5867448	5888836	but 7 is what sits on I'll put it this way I owned two games before I even had a Playstation that I could say was mine one of them was Final Fantasy 7 and the other one was Dragon Ball GT Final Battle which I wish I'd kept on held on to because it was worth money and I traded it for what's that?
5889457	5895699	Blue Stinger on Dreamcast for the Japanese version but that's it those are the two games I owned
5896534	5896894	All right.
5897595	5897955	There it is.
5897995	5899657	Your classic game of the week, everybody.
5900918	5907965	Final Fantasy VII as we listen to DarkSakura and Dan have a fight about what they did and they didn't own.
5910107	5913290	Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lawn Show.
5913310	5914150	But don't go anywhere, you guys.
5914170	5920977	We're going to come back for more of Orange Lawn Show with Part B where we're going to talk about one internet service provider might be throttling.
5921397	5922918	Your bandwidth when it comes to games.
5923278	5927701	Also, we're going to talk about some possible serious problems with the Wii U. It might not really work.
5928262	5928862	Oh, shit.
5929342	5930503	And of course, rapid fire news.
5930723	5936187	Your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR, your emails at mailbag at orangelandreale.com, and your calls on the Skype line.
5936347	5937928	All when we come back with more of Orange Landreale.
5938208	5947534	But before we go to our break tonight, I got to say, I believe Irene, unfortunately, is going to be leaving us because she's got like homework and like real world stuff.
5948095	5948335	Mm-hmm.
5948615	5949135	Oh, jeez.
5949435	5950896	But thanks for sitting in on the show.
5950956	5953557	I'm sorry you didn't get to talk too much, but... That's okay.
5953577	5954137	I talked enough.
5954617	5955618	It's nice to hear from you.
5955738	5956598	Don't be a stranger.
5957078	5957278	Sure.
5957479	5960300	Is there any parting words you want to say to our listeners tonight?
5961260	5961820	Not really, no.
5962220	5962480	Okay.
5962661	5963301	Well, then get out.
5963321	5963541	Bye.
5963601	5964021	I'm just kidding.
5964961	5965722	Well, thanks for being here.
5965902	5973705	And maybe we'll hear you at least, if not on OLR in the future, maybe a future episode of Horde House or somewhere in the Orange Lounge Radio family of programming.
5974528	5974889	Indeed.
5975130	5975430	All right.
5975771	5976052	All right.
5976152	5976372	All right.
5976773	5977756	So there you go.
5978176	5979820	We're going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere.
5979840	5982506	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5988976	5991539	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5991599	5999066	We are live on this Sunday evening, September the 11th of 2011, with the 427th episode of our show.
5999807	6004031	And we just had a fun Part A there, acknowledging the fact that it is Loki's birthday today.
6004131	6007114	And if you missed that in Part A, Irene showed up tonight.
6007174	6010557	She's left, sadly, but she brought Loki some bacon...
6011258	6012599	Dan, the man is here in studio joining us.
6012619	6013620	What have you been playing lately, Dan?
6013640	6014780	Dan, of course, Dark Sakura's husband.
6014800	6015721	What have you been up to?
6015741	6015961	I'm working.
6032850	6034191	You're not playing games?
6034551	6035692	I haven't got to play many games.
6035792	6036792	What is up with that?
6036873	6038333	Everybody's been saying that tonight.
6038373	6040115	I've been working too much to play games.
6040935	6041595	I understand, though.
6041635	6044897	I know you just recently started employment again and all that good stuff.
6045418	6045938	But that's good.
6046058	6046579	That's a good thing.
6046919	6048620	I did just pick up a copy of Left 4 Dead 2.
6049140	6049400	Yeah.
6049821	6055004	But I'm too cheap to pay for Xbox Live after getting it for free for the last six years.
6055404	6055704	Right.
6055824	6058786	So now I'm kind of like, oh man, three months is $25?
6058846	6058926	Yeah.
6060467	6061768	Screw Xbox Live.
6061888	6063609	Why didn't you guys go over to PlayStation 3 then?
6064790	6067132	Because none of the people I play games with have a PlayStation 3.
6067632	6070214	You know, I apologize.
6070254	6071915	I forget who said this in chat.
6071975	6076998	It's just a question that came up and it scrolled by, but it was while DarkSakura was doing the Classic Game of the Week, so I couldn't bring it up.
6077519	6089767	But to summarize, the question was, if a game is available on multiple platforms, including PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, what goes into your decision to decide what console you get the game on?
6090507	6117327	and for me certainly price weighs into it and bonus features and things of that sort but it's really about like where are my friends playing and most of the time if it's online they're probably on Xbox Live but there have been games that I bought on PlayStation 3 for the simple fact I am not going to use the fucking Xbox controller to play this game my decision for playing some of these is who can I borrow it from I'm kind of the opposite I like the 360 controller
6118416	6118736	Really?
6119117	6120598	But for some games I can't stand it.
6120618	6126122	Like Super Street Fighter 4, I bought it on the PlayStation 3 simply because I can't fucking stand the Xbox 360 controller for fighters.
6126142	6127423	That's why God made arcade sticks.
6127843	6129724	Yeah, but I don't want to buy an arcade stick.
6130285	6130705	Yes, you do.
6131125	6132026	I kind of do, you're right.
6132867	6133247	Told ya.
6134188	6136810	There are some games I would like to play with an arcade joystick.
6138271	6140452	Alright, so Left 4 Dead 2, gonna get back into that.
6140472	6141213	I guess you got some friends.
6141253	6142534	I've never really started on that.
6142634	6146136	I played the demo of both Left 4 Deads and I was always like...
6147509	6149209	Yeah, it's like a first-person shooter.
6150230	6154611	Seems like it might be kind of cool if I was playing with other people, but it's no fun to play by yourself.
6155151	6161713	I've watched Salacious Pop play a little bit of that, and it looks interesting, but I tried to play it, and I am fucking terrible at it.
6161873	6165654	You just need to find more people that have it in the system link.
6165834	6167095	It's such a team-based game.
6167235	6168235	I just bring the team down.
6169415	6171896	Well, the problem is one of the people we're going to play with is in Washington.
6172950	6176154	We just don't have that long of an Ethernet cable.
6177316	6180560	If anyone has an 800-mile Ethernet cable, hook it up.
6180941	6183664	Actually, XLink Kai, you can do that.
6183865	6185507	That's system link over the Internet.
6185767	6187930	Oh, yeah, like the GameSpy tunnel thing they used to do?
6188070	6188291	Yeah.
6188871	6189092	Nice.
6189793	6212223	but the one component that I have a hard time kind of defining like when I would buy a game for is the PC because I'm kind of like oh PC games are usually pretty niche and a lot of times like games I buy on the PC or only on the PC Diablo 3 would be a good example like although it's very likely Diablo 3 is coming to console I'm not gonna wait for it like I want it like when it fucking comes out so
6212663	6237189	and about Starcraft 2 on PC about Civilization 5 on PC those games only exist on PC the cross-platform stuff I tend to gravitate towards the consoles strictly because I like to curl up on the couch play the game like I don't know there's just PC games has a different maybe it's ridiculous I don't know but just like sitting in the office chair playing my PC games is not the same to me as being on the couch I love Steam all lazy
6237609	6243970	Yeah, but then, yeah, and Steam will occasionally have those really fucking good sales that will make me want to buy a game on it.
6244631	6244831	So.
6245111	6245671	I was broken.
6246131	6246291	So.
6246831	6251172	But, like, Portal's a good example of a game I bought on PC because it was a really good fucking deal.
6251212	6252832	I prefer playing it on PC.
6253052	6255733	I mean, for me, it's just easier to control, even with my trackball mouse.
6255833	6257353	Now, that's a keyboard mouse thing, right?
6257433	6257954	Yeah.
6259194	6259954	Yeah.
6259974	6264095	I played Portal on my PC because it looked better, but I used a 360 controller.
6264275	6264395	Hmm.
6265783	6267304	Interesting, okay.
6267744	6270005	I tried playing it with a 360 controller and I just didn't like it.
6270325	6271465	It wasn't very intuitive to me.
6271485	6274187	Yeah, I played DC Universe on the PC, but I played with a controller.
6275167	6278588	Now, I was, you know, I was stuck on using a controller forever.
6278608	6280969	Like when I played Final Fantasy XI, I used a controller.
6280989	6283731	I had all my macros cued to my trigger buttons and everything.
6284531	6288973	And I played PSO, you know, with a controller.
6289293	6293935	And it wasn't until I started playing World of Warcraft that I started playing keyboard and mouse.
6295163	6301726	Something that came up on this week's Horde House, plug, plug, the show I do all about, all things World of Warcraft at www.hordehouse.com.
6301766	6303107	Never too seriously, though, with Extifer.
6303887	6309549	One of the things he brought up this week was that his brother-in-law likes to play World of Warcraft, I guess something he's been getting into, on a PS3 controller.
6309890	6311070	And, like, it actually kind of works.
6311130	6317173	And the way it, it's very similar to how Final Fantasy XI played on the PlayStation 2 controller, where you have to kind of macro things to buttons.
6317653	6318673	But it actually kind of works.
6318733	6320074	He was doing quests with them and everything.
6320094	6324416	I guess the only thing that gets a little wonky, I think, he said was the camera gets a little weird.
6324736	6325237	I can see that.
6325417	6326680	But I found that to be very interesting.
6326900	6330687	But you know, if he's fast enough with macro attacks, I bet using controller would make him really good for PvP.
6331778	6333400	Yeah, could be very interesting.
6333420	6335682	Because I can't do PvP because I can't mouse turn with my mouse.
6337103	6340126	I just do hide in the corner while everyone else does PvP.
6341948	6343489	That's why the big battlegrounds are fun.
6343569	6344110	Yeah, that's why.
6344210	6345151	I like the big battlegrounds.
6345511	6350916	Yeah, so I guess it's really just a number of factors that go into the decision.
6350996	6354720	I can't sit here and say, oh, I would always go PS3 because I don't.
6355240	6355721	It just kind of...
6356221	6357602	Where's everyone else going to be?
6357702	6359122	What kind of game is it?
6359202	6360843	Where am I going to be playing it the most?
6361223	6362364	All those things kind of weigh into it.
6362444	6366565	For me, I really just prefer almost anything on Xbox 360.
6366625	6372868	The controller feels pretty comfortable to my hand because I have to have a slightly wider reach on the PS3.
6373808	6378330	And the way that the little parts that stick out sit on my hand is because of my surgery, really.
6379270	6380291	So it's hard for me.
6380831	6381451	I will say this.
6381632	6391217	I'm glad I have the choice, and I realize not everyone invests in the 360 and the PS3 and a high-end PC capable of running today's games.
6391557	6400402	I realize not everybody can juggle all those things, but I like that I'm fortunate enough where I have been able to have all those so I can make the decision.
6401496	6405117	For the record, I just got completely lightheaded once the sugar hit my brain.
6405597	6406337	From those cupcakes?
6406737	6407077	I know.
6407257	6407997	Good times.
6408478	6409138	And my stomach aches.
6409158	6411358	The butter and the buttercream is kind of making me feel sick.
6411438	6412298	I only ate one.
6412318	6412979	I'm eating it anyway.
6413039	6416159	I had a frappuccino on the way in here and that was enough sugar so I didn't need it.
6416239	6419720	We'll get you the other lid for another lid for that other container.
6419800	6422681	You guys all know how I feel about pumpkin and pumpkin spice frappuccinos.
6422901	6425241	I want a pumpkin spice muffin right the hell now.
6425781	6427742	No, I've been wanting one since breakfast.
6429262	6431624	You better go now before all the Starbucks close.
6433065	6433426	You know what?
6433486	6438770	They should have had pumpkin at... No, because I didn't like the pumpkin at Pinkberry.
6439811	6441012	Oh, I love the pumpkin at Pinkberry.
6441032	6441452	It was good.
6442353	6443194	It wasn't as good.
6443254	6444935	Anyway, let's move on.
6446476	6447577	Let's get into rapid fire news.
6447777	6448938	Back to gaming news.
6449178	6453202	A lot of quick stories we want to talk about with you guys before we get to some of the other stuff.
6455243	6455864	Loki, start us off.
6457094	6462846	Just like they did with the Resident Evil series, they're going to be bringing HD remakes of Devil May Cry 1, 2, and 3.
6464810	6466710	to the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.
6493835	6496318	Look forward to an announcement I'm sure soon.
6498600	6506109	And to kind of go along with that, Crysis, rumored to be coming to the new consoles, now has...
6508703	6512245	I guess it's going to be coming to the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this October.
6513025	6516007	Also coming, I believe, from a leak as well.
6517628	6519989	And, of course, these games are going to be remastered.
6520009	6522450	They're going to be also available in 3D.
6523291	6526492	And they announced that they're going to be 1,600 Microsoft points or 1,999.
6529194	6529954	So that's kind of cool.
6530875	6531675	And those will be coming soon.
6531835	6533756	And the original price, this was a really good game.
6533836	6534096	Just...
6535897	6541124	I couldn't finish mine on the PC because, well, it wouldn't let me.
6542766	6543487	Bad glitches.
6544869	6549675	And then, last but not least, there's this trend, I wouldn't say it's a
6551092	6552553	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6568206	6568947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6584068	6585489	and whatnot.
6586170	6597539	So yeah, apparently this guy had it happen and the police chief believes that the griefer is hacked into a 911 text messaging service to pull off the griefing.
6598060	6606306	So we have officers responding lights and sirens to a call they think is an emergency in progress and they get there only to find out it's a hoax.
6607807	6608828	That's fucked up.
6608868	6613972	There's 100 documented cases so far the FBI is tracking.
6614933	6617075	All the way from Oregon through Florida.
6618976	6621058	That is so fucked up to do that.
6621078	6622219	Freaking juvenile.
6622259	6624721	That better fucking come around to bite these people in the ass.
6624741	6628824	Because not only is it just fucked up to do to somebody, but that is such a waste of money.
6628884	6632227	Because the police department, the fire department, they've got to take that shit seriously, you know?
6632647	6636850	And that's thousands of dollars of our money that's spent on these lols.
6636890	6638632	And it's not fucking funny, you know what I mean?
6639132	6639933	It's just sad.
6640653	6641394	Very unfortunate.
6641834	6644857	Although I'd have to ask is how the fuck did they get the guy's address?
6646826	6647926	That's a very good question.
6648467	6651848	Unfortunately, probably more hacking of some sort.
6652748	6655269	Could it be as simple as the guys in the white pages?
6655869	6657090	Does that even exist anymore?
6657110	6658050	I guess it does.
6658070	6659051	There are still phone books.
6659431	6662952	Yeah, they drop a phone book off at my doorstep every once in a while.
6663272	6664893	It's just a big advertisement for all the companies.
6664933	6665573	So you know what?
6666053	6669855	In the day and age that we live in right now with the internet, I just throw that shit in the garbage.
6669875	6670895	A phone book's a waste of money.
6671295	6671935	It's unfortunate.
6672836	6673076	Anyhow.
6673716	6674797	Moving on to some more news.
6675358	6682523	The SimSocial we mentioned earlier, it is currently a more active game than FarmVille on Facebook.
6682563	6686847	So SimSocial has now actually surpassed FarmVille in the amount of daily active users.
6687207	6692451	The SimSocial is seeing an average of 9.3 million active users per day.
6692991	6697175	They play, on the average, three times a day in 15 to 20 minute increments.
6697195	6699216	Of course, if you're DarkSakura, that's backwards.
6699256	6702419	She plays 15 to 20 times a day in three minute increments.
6703707	6729777	That's pretty true Okay, I'm not kidding Anyhow, Farmville still has 8.1 million people But the most popular game on Facebook right now Cityville, also by Zynga 13.9 million users a day The only app that gets more traffic than that Is Windows Messenger Live Which is somehow integrated into Facebook I've never even used that There you go What isn't said is how much fucking wall spam Has gone out because of this app
6730984	6734265	It's one of those things I hate that I play it, but I can't stop playing ARG.
6735285	6736725	I would block people that did that.
6736926	6740686	Here's a game that I can't be sad about enjoying because it's really fucking good.
6740746	6741507	LittleBigPlanet 2.
6742167	6746148	Well, okay, so I haven't really played the sequel like I've played the original, but I will at some point.
6746288	6747248	It just went on sale.
6747288	6748348	I need to get it.
6748408	6751489	LittleBigPlanet 2 just got its Move patch.
6752089	6753310	I could loan it to you.
6753690	6754630	That would be great.
6755130	6766360	It's not going live just yet until the Move Pack goes out, but Update 1.06 is out, which does release some new sensors, some limiting players on homebrew levels.
6766680	6769183	You can control the basic game with the Move Controller now.
6769283	6778150	So all that stuff is setting up to take away for the Move Support officially in LittleBigPlanet 2, which comes with the Move Pack very, very, very soon.
6779391	6787833	Lastly, if you build games a little more seriously than LittleBigPlanet 2, not to say LittleBigPlanet isn't serious business, but this is real serious business.
6788473	6790713	Raw source code of popular games.
6790773	6791433	How popular?
6791913	6795314	Wolfenstein 3D Platinum and Doom Classic.
6795774	6796574	Don't worry, guys.
6796654	6797534	This is legit.
6797754	6800535	ID Software actually released the source codes themselves.
6800895	6802935	You can go get the source codes for these games.
6804135	6805116	And there you go.
6805196	6805836	It's update 2.1.
6809162	6822442	and you can go grab the source code and tinker away at that I'd be excited to see what kind of games come out of that I think the Wolfenstein code had been released before and this is some type of upgrade but there you go moving on DarkSakura what do you have for us
6823746	6824726	DJ Max Technica
6841171	6844273	and that it's going to use both the touchscreen and the rear touch panel.
6844573	6845074	So who knows?
6845594	6851818	That makes a lot of sense considering that, you know, when I heard about this, I was like, oh yeah, because the game is basically on a giant touchscreen.
6852038	6853239	It's basically Elite Beat Agents.
6853459	6853679	Yeah.
6855720	6865426	And then other news, Microsoft says 42% of US Xbox Live Gold members watch an average of an hour of video content a day.
6866426	6869628	And that's including Hulu Plus, Netflix and Zoom on Xbox 360.
6869668	6869748	Yeah.
6870969	6876091	So it looks like there are going to be quite a bit more going on.
6876591	6887354	In fact, it was reported by Terry Farrell, not to be confused with the lady that played Judzia Dax, who is the senior product manager of Xbox Live Entertainment.
6887954	6888914	This report comes from him.
6889094	6894116	So they're going to definitely be working to up that in the fall dashboard update.
6895717	6898519	And then, sad, sad, sad news.
6899800	6903502	Game writing pioneer Bill Kunkel passed away.
6904243	6904803	Very sad.
6904863	6906384	He died on September 4th.
6907045	6908666	He was the Game Doctor.
6909106	6910627	Does it sound familiar to anybody?
6910767	6916231	I totally remember the Game Doctor columns from the old magazines from back in the, oh God, that was the 80s.
6916251	6917352	Computer gaming world?
6918433	6919814	Video game computer entertainment, right?
6920314	6946654	Yep And the original Electronic Games, not to be confused with Electronic Gaming Monthly Yeah Oh yeah, I remember those magazines, we had them all That and the Commodore 64 magazines, but Bill wasn't a part of those I don't think Well, he was 61 years old And he'd been working on video game columns since 1978 And he co-founded EGM Wow He will be missed
6948350	6975588	as I understand it he was working right up until the unfortunate because the death was unexpected as I hear so he was still doing some work on websites and so forth so it's surprising it's very unfortunate I'm pulling up a list of other things that he worked on because he said he also did stuff for DC and Marvel actually also worked with KKWD Fog Studios Metropolis Media
6977503	6978224	Lots of stuff.
6979605	6983088	And did a lot of the strategy guides for Prima.
6984128	6984429	Oh, wow.
6984849	6993256	Maximum Carnage, Descent, FPS Baseball, Gex, Die Hard Trilogy, NFL Quarterback Club 98, Madden 64, and Brady.
6993696	6996518	So he was actually getting into game development at some point.
6996618	6998700	He did Madden 64 for a Brady game.
6999240	6999661	Oh, I see.
6999701	6999941	Okay.
6999961	7000561	Interesting.
7001062	7001382	Interesting.
7001582	7003323	So yeah, pretty crazy stuff.
7004064	7004544	It's too bad.
7005084	7005725	Yeah, too bad.
7006605	7006926	All right.
7007426	7009427	Well, that's it for our quick news tonight.
7009507	7012209	So let's get back into more news.
7012610	7015832	I don't know why we have the quick news and the long news, but that's just the way we've been doing it.
7016252	7016672	Whatever.
7016732	7017633	Let's move on, Loki.
7019714	7030098	So, you may remember that during Gamescom they announced that the PSP is going to be getting a new version out in Europe that was going to be Sans Wi-Fi.
7030759	7037262	And I'm kind of wondering why they went ahead and did this seeing as the Vita is going to be coming out soon.
7038162	7041685	Well, one of the things that they're trying to do is target teens.
7042466	7043606	It's all for the audience.
7043646	7049070	If we're going to take PSP very young, teens and much younger, they're happy to just play the game.
7049290	7054094	If taking Wi-Fi out is the price to pay, we're happy to do it.
7056456	7062160	They also believe that the price point will give the console a much-needed sales bump, especially during the upcoming holiday season.
7062980	7069582	and they're saying that at, you know, 99 euro, it'll make a great Christmas gift.
7070502	7074844	Of course, the new system's dubbed the E1000.
7074924	7082066	Honestly, I mean, if you're really looking for a PSP system, you can buy...
7083837	7084237	DarkSakura.com
7105120	7108984	I understand that, but they are connected to the internet.
7109124	7111806	It's like they're saying, well, teenagers are just happy to play the game.
7112267	7115730	Yes, some of them are just happy to play the games, but you know what?
7116371	7125179	You can still buy one of your older PSP systems and have that functionality in there for the same price, if not cheaper.
7125796	7136679	Have you heard that whole, not to deviate too much from the story, but have you heard that whole story about how the kids at some schools in certain districts are now, instead of getting textbooks, they get iPads with the books on them?
7137460	7141841	Because, believe it or not, a $600 iPad or whatever, well, what's the lowest one cost?
7141861	7142061	Maybe $400?
7142901	7146822	Those iPads are cheaper than some of the textbooks for all those classes combined.
7147262	7149103	It's like the iPad is becoming a cheaper alternative.
7149503	7150303	It's crazy.
7150543	7151364	To the textbooks.
7151704	7151864	Yep.
7152364	7152944	How about this?
7153064	7162628	How about instead of spending $500 on an iPad, which granted is a good piece of technology, but how about you spend it on a cheaper e-reader and you can put those books on there?
7162648	7164309	Dude, you can get HP touchpads for $100.
7164389	7166310	They should have got in on that deal.
7166950	7174753	I mean, if it's reading just books, that's all it's doing, I think there's cheaper alternatives out there than just that.
7175214	7176214	Or here's an idea.
7177677	7186183	Pretty much everybody nowadays in school and stuff, and I know that there's people out there that are without a substantial income.
7186964	7189986	But you gotta admit, most people probably have a PC at home.
7190927	7192928	The majority of people out there have a PC.
7194189	7196551	Just give it to them in a PDF format or something like that.
7196571	7198172	I guess if you're bringing it to school.
7200223	7205106	A desktop, you could have a desktop computer at each one of these desks.
7205166	7208288	I think a lot do now.
7208408	7212031	Yes, and then just have the book on there.
7212971	7213331	Jeez.
7214012	7219375	All right, going to our chatroom at chat.orange.com, taking you back to what the story was originally about before we got on that tangent.
7219896	7224018	Toagak in our chatroom says, you want to know what my PSP is used for?
7224038	7224739	99% Wi-Fi, 1% games.
7227200	7228021	I've heard that a lot.
7228121	7235987	Not so much the teenage crowd, but the college crowd really loves that the PSP is a web browser, an MP3 player, and it happens to play games.
7236368	7239090	And I've said this a million times on the show before.
7239110	7240531	I'm starting to sound like a broken record.
7240831	7244474	The PSP's biggest strength was always the fact that it didn't just do games.
7244514	7249138	It did, well, like their little tagline, it only does everything, and that really is Sony's strength.
7249758	7252200	It's not going to do much, though, when it doesn't have Wi-Fi.
7252561	7253181	Exactly.
7253701	7255463	So it's like, it only does nothing.
7257867	7258807	is what this system does.
7259087	7262649	I just don't understand what the point is because they're all, well, help bump sales.
7263729	7270171	I don't know about the Europe region, but in the US and North America, there's not a lot of PSP games coming out.
7270371	7271271	There's like five.
7271871	7273292	Five for the whole fourth quarter.
7274293	7280037	I was fascinated to go to Fry's today as I was talking about before and see that they are still selling the PSP movies.
7281078	7282559	You can still buy PSP movies.
7282799	7286342	Yeah, probably got them for a good deal because no one's selling them anymore.
7286482	7288384	Yeah, five to ten bucks tops.
7288424	7292427	Sony was the only one for the longest time that was putting out movies on that system.
7292447	7295669	The last movie I remember on the UMD format was 2012.
7296170	7296250	And...
7299432	7302734	That's a Sony title, so obviously that makes sense why that would be on there.
7302874	7304855	Well, it sort of makes sense.
7305295	7307776	But, I mean, those things are dirt cheap now.
7308056	7309957	They're definitely not manufacturing them anymore.
7309997	7312679	But, yeah, I don't understand the point.
7312699	7315460	I mean, of course they want their system to sell well, but...
7317265	7338850	I think removing a pretty integral feature from the system that once again you know with the whole PSP Go and stuff you don't need to reinvent the system to help itself I mean why are you gonna spend more money on a system that does less I mean that's the whole point here why would I spend more money on a system that doesn't have Wi-Fi when I can yeah use this in preferred but you know what
7340905	7345109	Those so-called teenagers probably don't give a shit that it's a little bit used.
7346070	7349153	And it will come with games for less than that.
7349513	7351735	In fact, I think I was taking a look here.
7351955	7356740	I saw some used PSP systems on eBay.
7357981	7359202	We'll see here.
7359882	7361904	They've got the Gigapack or whatever. $65.
7363866	7364386	and many more.
7390113	7392595	And they're region-free, so why not?
7392715	7394276	Or at this point, you might as well just wait for the Vita.
7396357	7396658	All right.
7396858	7397478	Or get something else.
7398239	7400820	Well, moving on to a totally different topic.
7400860	7404043	This is about not getting between somebody and their bandwidth.
7404083	7410627	You know, nothing gets the internet rabble-rabbled more than hearing about internet service providers and their recent restrictions.
7411107	7413869	Well, this has to do with a Canadian provider, actually.
7413889	7419413	It has to do with Rogers Cable and Telcom, who's Canada's largest broadband provider.
7419873	7427396	Apparently, they had some complaints from World of Warcraft players saying that the World of Warcraft traffic was being throttled.
7427437	7429517	Now, oh my gosh, that just goes double so.
7429597	7434140	Do not get between, and I say this as a Warcraft player, do not get between me and my WoW.
7434580	7437581	Do not try to limit my bandwidth and lower my ping times.
7438161	7443944	And there was accusations that Rogers was apparently throttling the bandwidth and so forth.
7444624	7454428	Rogers has admitted that the game's online traffic might actually trip the monitors that kind of monitor this stuff and result in throttling.
7454488	7459230	They are calling this inadvertent, but that doesn't fix the problem.
7460011	7462392	I guess Canadian regulators have even gotten involved.
7462672	7465853	The Canadian Gamers Organization, I didn't even know that existed.
7465893	7466493	That's kind of cool.
7466833	7470175	They actually filed an inquiry into the practices of this company.
7471176	7479863	So I guess what happens is because you've got the peer-to-peer traffic going on in World of Warcraft, it's being misclassified as something more nefarious.
7480184	7483246	By the way, the same thing apparently is happening in Call of Duty Black Ops.
7483967	7491874	I guess the rule is that if something is transmitting 80k BPS or more, it is what is enabling the throttling.
7493075	7498259	So, now Rogers says that the games can all run underneath that rate.
7498599	7503202	So, those who are experiencing the throttling must be running some type of other application with the gaming.
7503623	7507005	But I kind of sit there and go, well, what about like Ventrilo and some of the other stuff?
7507025	7511448	And I'm notorious for playing WoW and surfing the web at the same time.
7511949	7515271	Just put a renew on somebody and then, you know, go alt tab and check my email.
7515972	7516672	So, yeah.
7517953	7519814	Anyhow, let's see.
7520454	7542567	I guess the co-founder of the Canadian Gamer Organization said, "...rather than fixing the issue and actively whitelisting gaming systems to ensure they are not affected, Rogers is continuing to rely on consumer input and complaints rather than put forth the active testing needed to ensure compliance with CRTC policy.
7542967	7546469	We believe this approach is inappropriate under these circumstances."
7546969	7555737	So the Canadian Gamers Organization is going to ask for a new law requiring providers like Rogers to have a formal way for customers to report complaints.
7556358	7560201	So Canadians are pissed and you don't hear that very often.
7560842	7561522	Yeah.
7562243	7565206	So now, honestly, I think I would be, too.
7566467	7566707	Oh, yeah.
7566747	7568128	You don't get between somebody in there.
7568148	7568388	Wow.
7568428	7569009	You just don't.
7569049	7569549	Yeah.
7569569	7570210	Call of Duty.
7570430	7571131	Those people, you know.
7572613	7577116	The shitty thing is that it is legitimate use of the internet and it's being throttled.
7577316	7585122	I understand why they want to throttle bandwidth and so forth, but unfortunately, legit people pay the cost.
7585562	7586323	Somebody else.
7588164	7589665	All the time, the common thing.
7589765	7592107	Same thing we've said about DRM time and time again.
7593748	7594789	Let's get to the emails.
7595635	7603323	Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelaundry.com DarkSakura's gonna dive into the email bag and pull out a few of her favorite emails.
7603683	7604444	Ew, it's so sticky!
7606164	7606844	Alright, the first one.
7607384	7611045	Hi all, just wanted to point out that you could actually surf the net on the DS.
7611605	7613725	They just didn't release the attachments in the USA.
7613845	7617686	When I was in Japan, I bought it and it was one of the ones that used the GBA slot in a different way.
7618366	7623407	As for the 3DS versus Vita, well, I just got a 3DS.
7623447	7624667	The PSP never appealed to me.
7624767	7625708	I love the 3DS.
7626308	7633109	Although I did buy mine on eBay for $195 with 3DS games included and the Nintendo Ambassador program.
7633729	7639673	with the Vita, and by the way, it's V-I-T-A, not D-A.
7641754	7647118	It would have to pull off something really impressive because Netflix on my 3DS is awesome.
7647498	7651581	Not going to buy another system if the one I have now can do it already, and that's from Holly D.
7653422	7654342	You know what, that is correct.
7654362	7661826	I could have sworn we would have made that clear, because I was aware that the DS had a web browser, but only on the DSs that had the eShop.
7662266	7664967	And that would start with the DSi and above.
7665267	7669549	However, but I do remember what I did forget, that Japan did have a cart.
7670430	7672451	They actually, I found one for sale at the local dimple.
7672771	7674332	The US also had a cartridge.
7674352	7674972	Did they really?
7675092	7675353	Yes.
7675573	7676433	I didn't know that.
7676573	7678534	It came with a memory expansion slot.
7678855	7680896	Or a memory expansion that goes in the Game Boy Advance slot.
7680916	7683297	Well, I did forget about the browser and the cartridge.
7683377	7684758	But still terrible.
7684878	7687199	I don't like browsing the web on the 3DS either.
7687860	7688620	It is terrible.
7688640	7689261	It's clunky.
7689301	7689621	I don't know.
7689901	7691162	Well, moving forward.
7691382	7692142	Needs to be optimized.
7692362	7692543	Okay.
7693583	7693883	Evening.
7694304	7698026	I would have sent this last week, but didn't realize you had a Labor Day weekend show.
7698686	7701848	Anyhow, I see the mobile game Flight Control is now available for WiiWare.
7702388	7708292	Fairly nice to have this one on a full display with local multiplayer, although the lack of verses is somewhat disappointing.
7708792	7712434	Also, it really puts the infamous Wii Remote jitter...
7714375	7715475	Jitterfront and Center.
7715936	7716176	Sorry.
7716896	7720537	I believe last year FireMint was supposed to have a PS Move version of the game.
7720897	7722978	Did they say why this never came out in North America?
7723038	7726539	And that's from Robert M. No, and I gotta admit, I'm not very familiar with that game.
7726559	7727299	What is it called again?
7727379	7728199	Flight Control?
7728859	7729599	Hmm.
7729639	7731440	Loki, is this a game you know about?
7731560	7739482	I think Flight Control is one of those air traffic controller games where you control the different planes that are taking off and stuff.
7739502	7741043	I think they have that kind of stuff on the iPod.
7741063	7742223	It might have been a WiiWare game.
7742583	7744104	It said it was originally a mobile game.
7745205	7747787	I'm looking at a trailer here for the game.
7748628	7751210	I'm so visual I need to see this here.
7754473	7754693	Oh!
7755233	7755594	See?
7755774	7758476	Once I see it, this is based on an iPad game.
7759537	7763880	This is where you draw the path of the planes and you don't want them to collide.
7764181	7765322	This is based off an iPad game.
7767677	7768558	See, I just had to see it.
7769058	7769819	I do know this game.
7770839	7773521	I didn't know that they had ported it to anything besides the iPad.
7773561	7774522	That part's news to me.
7777324	7777844	So there you go.
7778105	7781567	Sorry, I don't know the other answer to your question.
7781607	7782007	I'm sorry.
7782568	7785009	Rob, you're going to need to pull up this email because apparently there's a YouTube link.
7785029	7786410	I'm going to copy it to you.
7786851	7788172	Yeah, just copy the YouTube link to me.
7788432	7792635	But I will read you the... Let me just paste it to you real quick.
7792655	7792735	Sure.
7795029	7797030	Live Radio Kids, that's what we're all about here.
7797550	7798290	Hey, I'm fast.
7799110	7800131	With my damn trackball.
7800551	7801771	Do I play it now or when you say?
7802652	7804512	After this, I'll go ahead and read this.
7804933	7806653	Yo homies, Xenocore here.
7807353	7811415	I'm sad that I just discovered this song, but you must use this for Listless this Sunday.
7812195	7812535	Okay?
7813776	7815856	This is from the Rubber Bandits, Horse Outside.
7816297	7818577	And don't use the clean version, this song is freaking awesome.
7818777	7820078	I think they're talking about Cage Match.
7820838	7822399	Oh, yeah, it's probably Cage Match.
7823320	7824020	But, hey.
7824060	7824681	Dudes with accents.
7824701	7826262	Let me forward a little bit here.
7826282	7829304	Yeah, I think this is something for the Cage Match segment, not the... Veto!
7829324	7829564	That's it.
7829584	7830785	I'll check it out later.
7830845	7831005	Veto.
7831025	7832086	Not when we're live on air.
7850250	7850670	Well, that's it.
7851171	7851571	That's it?
7851891	7852212	That's it.
7852292	7853072	We need more emails.
7853112	7857116	Well, the other one was someone trying to get us to, like, post his stuff, and I'm like, no.
7857636	7859718	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com.
7859758	7860398	Free plugs.
7861619	7862600	You have to disguise your free plugs.
7862640	7863321	I'm not free.
7863561	7863801	All right.
7865503	7865823	All right.
7866143	7869306	Let's get to the part of the show where we... It costs a lot of money to be this cheap.
7870467	7872909	Let's get to the part of the show where we get ranty.
7872949	7876492	It's the FUs of the week, and we do them here on the show because we can.
7892962	7896005	F you to finding out about emo crap during the show.
7897046	7897366	Puh.
7899008	7899288	Loki.
7899889	7901390	Fuck you, my cat, for being an asshole.
7903946	7905287	Um, I don't know.
7905767	7907829	F you to the fact that this weekend was shorter than last week.
7907889	7910150	No, F you to the three hour nap I took yesterday.
7910451	7914493	This is the first weekend in forever where I had literally nothing planned on Saturday.
7914553	7917075	It was amazing to just sit at home all day and veg.
7917515	7918156	But what did I do?
7918256	7920477	I napped literally the whole damn day away.
7921078	7922759	But I feel really rested and I feel great.
7923680	7924880	So, I guess I needed it.
7925781	7927422	But F you to what felt like a wasted day.
7928803	7936934	Alright, a few more news stories for you guys, then we're going to open it up to you guys via Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7936974	7939277	But don't call yet, because we still have a few more stories to get through.
7940218	7941881	Origin has been doing pretty well.
7942241	7943242	EA's new...
7945305	7945686	DarkSakura.com
7962846	7965608	They're going to be adding third-party content very soon.
7966569	7977618	And, of course, they're saying that it will use its collection of 130 million users and various payment methods to attract third-party games to Origin.
7979079	7980720	So, wait a second.
7981421	7985724	So what they're saying is they have 4 million client installs, yet 130 million users?
7985744	7985804	Yes.
7989056	7990197	That doesn't really make sense to me.
7991577	7991857	Whatever.
7992418	7996039	I guess they're talking about maybe their electronic arts site.
7996139	8004163	Oh, like when you do Dragon Age and stuff, you have to sign up for their stupid online thing.
8004203	8006444	I like how they count all those players in there.
8007064	8008265	They don't have a choice.
8008365	8011866	They have to sign up on that site in order to play those games.
8011926	8014348	It's not like, oh, I love EA.
8014508	8017289	I'm going to totally register an account with them because...
8018001	8022682	They're awesome, and I love their products, and you have no choice.
8023562	8024722	But I like how they skew that.
8024942	8025542	That's awesome.
8027063	8037465	And then, of course, there's some information from Origin regarding a new remake of Syndicate, that series.
8038085	8044806	Apparently, it's going to be done by the developer Starbreeze, who did Escape from Butcher Bay and The Darkness.
8046968	8049211	and I guess they're showing off some stuff.
8051553	8053234	Some stuff, I guess, leaked out from their website.
8053875	8055056	Looks interesting.
8055276	8059459	They're saying the story's penned by the guy that did the Crisis 2 script.
8060360	8062382	And he also wrote some books and stuff.
8062922	8069828	Also, that it's supposed to debut next week in the Game Reactor magazine, which is a Swedish publication.
8070949	8073571	And, I don't know, it looks kind of cool.
8073891	8076033	So, I guess...
8077881	8084445	Check out the EA Origins store if you want to catch some details on that or just check out the web because it's leaked out.
8087346	8087706	All right.
8088787	8092929	I have yet to use the Origins store, but I remember we got a call last week saying it's not that bad, you guys.
8094390	8099072	But it is interesting that it has so many installs, but isn't that because it's kind of forced on people?
8099913	8100193	I don't know.
8100407	8103471	Well, Origin, I mean, some of it's probably voluntary.
8103531	8110320	Some of it was, didn't it become Origin like it was something else and then it just translated over to Origin?
8110360	8118209	God, whenever, well, whenever I hear Origin, I think about the old school publishing house or studio that would make games, like the old Ultimate games were all Origin.
8118250	8119231	Yeah, I think that's what this is.
8119591	8120552	No, no, no, no, no.
8120612	8121593	This is Steam.
8121814	8122535	This is their Steam.
8122895	8127260	Well, I understand that, but Origin was that company, and now it's the site.
8127280	8131384	Right, EA sucked them up and then never used the name, and now they just brought back the name for this.
8131465	8134148	But the two uses of the name have nothing to do with each other.
8135269	8135910	Does that make sense?
8136370	8137131	Oh, yeah, it makes sense.
8139133	8144896	Anyhow, Wii U, this has been some big news talking about this week.
8145137	8153661	And, you know, while this reeks of being a rumor, this is coming from that French site that's been getting a lot of smoking guns lately.
8153862	8160365	They've become quite the site to get the early gossip because they leaked the news about the Vita, right?
8160505	8160846	I think.
8161206	8164988	They leaked the news about the extra thing on the 3DS, which now we have a picture of.
8165388	8166709	And now they're talking about this.
8166809	8177779	This, so take it with a grain of salt, but it's very interesting regarding the Wii U. Apparently, they're saying that Nintendo is having big problems getting the Wii U up and running.
8178220	8182503	Apparently, the Wii U is not up to wanting to do what Nintendo needs it to do.
8182904	8188008	It's not just running the console, but beaming the data to the touchscreen controller as well.
8188028	8191552	Apparently, developers that are working on the console, they use tethers,
8192012	8197255	To ensure that the communication, so basically it has to do with the wireless aspect of it.
8197535	8202938	And right now the developers have to use a wire to the controller to make sure the information gets across fast enough.
8203959	8206860	Even then, apparently things aren't still working out that well.
8207181	8211603	Progress is halted daily with repeated software updates for the pad.
8212143	8213084	Hmm, interesting.
8213785	8218072	Um, apparently these problems are causing a delay in the console's launch.
8218472	8222699	Originally, they had been looking at June 2012, but now they're saying September 2012, which to me...
8224990	8228754	I personally, I would have said, well, that was the time frame I was thinking for the system anyway.
8228774	8231116	So that doesn't seem like such a huge setback.
8231736	8234739	Now, obviously, you can't prove these allegations.
8234919	8239183	Nintendo, even though the blogs are trying to get them to comment, they're not going to.
8239203	8241165	They're going to say, we don't comment on rumors and speculation.
8241505	8247551	But it definitely kind of says, hmm, maybe this is not going to be ready by the time it needs to be.
8247551	8248071	It's hard to say.
8248171	8248952	It's not good.
8248972	8249432	I just don't know...
8272102	8275065	I just don't know if it's really going to end up being true.
8275145	8279809	Obviously, they're not going to launch the system if it's not going to work.
8279829	8281991	Yeah, if flat doesn't work, they're not going to launch it.
8282051	8286135	But might they have to downgrade it a little bit to get it to work?
8286395	8288457	Or I guess it could go the other way around.
8288477	8290378	They'd have to upgrade it to get it to work too, huh?
8290418	8291920	I'm not sure which way it goes.
8291980	8296324	Do you downgrade the processing power so that way there's not as much data to transmit?
8296444	8297424	Or do you upgrade?
8298245	8299967	I guess it's finding the balance.
8300467	8316694	but it is interesting that the PlayStation 3 kind of does this with the PSP right now it's a little lag though I mean it wouldn't the technology has to get a little bit better than that I don't know how it's going to work with the PS3 and the Vita but you know it's a little bit laggy and obviously they don't want that on the Wii U
8317523	8321027	So I'm wondering, though, what it uses.
8322148	8325051	Because I was just looking this up.
8325311	8326393	Just a theory here.
8326413	8334381	The reason why we may be seeing the whole 3DS getting a second analog stick is maybe they're just not going to put out the controller at all.
8335541	8336061	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8356584	8356824	Maybe?
8356844	8357364	I don't know.
8357625	8359706	Interesting comment from Imaginomicon in chat.
8360046	8362907	In all fairness, Kinect had basically the same situation.
8363007	8367309	That is, it couldn't do what they initially advertised and was eventually gimped.
8367709	8372372	Weren't there early rumors about the Kinect that the Kinect couldn't see certain races and things like that?
8372472	8374973	Yeah, that's not true, though.
8375413	8379035	Okay, that was just bad PR for Microsoft.
8379075	8380355	Oh, it can't see black people.
8380596	8381496	No, that's not true.
8382048	8384271	Well, obviously I can now, but, you know.
8384431	8385733	Well, it could before.
8385773	8390318	It was just like if you're playing on, you know, it depends on where you're playing.
8390338	8393162	If you're playing with something with a lot of light interference or, you know, if it's...
8394794	8398236	I can't play Connect in the Dark either.
8398296	8401598	I mean, you gotta have some, you know, some light.
8401618	8409342	So, it was stupid because it was like, well, actually, it won't detect anybody in those lighting conditions and not necessarily just people of a certain race.
8409462	8411724	So, yeah, that was just...
8412324	8429330	But I do seem to recall that it seemed like the Kinect... I want to say there was a story about how they did have to kind of change the Kinect too, so... Well, I think they dropped the resolution down so they could have more bandwidth to go between the sensor and the system, but...
8431019	8431700	Thanks for watching!
8449800	8451481	I don't understand why it's not possible.
8451642	8458806	I mean, you can do it on the PSP, but you can do it on the PSP over the internet and over that 802.11g.
8459086	8467872	So maybe, like I said before, more bandwidth there and allow you to be able to do what you can't do on the console.
8467912	8471655	Although, why couldn't you make the controller connect to your Wi-Fi network?
8472255	8473536	Hey, then you can even add it.
8473576	8478800	So, hey, look, you can surf the web on this controller, but it's not going to let you do that.
8480140	8484122	Alright, well let's move on with a few more stories before we get to the Twitter topics and phone calls.
8484182	8487544	I'm expecting to hear about this and some phone calls tonight.
8487964	8488785	DarkSakura, next story.
8489845	8493527	Well, how about the scariest Xbox 360 game?
8493567	8494407	What do you think it would be?
8496588	8498549	Scariest Xbox 360 game?
8499330	8499650	I don't know.
8500865	8505148	Well, it looks that the major vote goes for Dead Space 2.
8505248	8510151	That that is considered to be the scariest game.
8511111	8526121	And this is coming just ahead of what they did is they actually tested core and casual gamers' heart rate, sweat levels, and body temperature while playing Alan Wake, Resident Evil 5, Dead Space 2, and Condemned.
8526201	8528242	It was sad that Yaris wasn't included in there.
8530099	8532781	That would have been nausea-inducing, not scary.
8533881	8534941	How about Connectimals?
8535001	8536462	Some of those fuckers are pretty frightening.
8536782	8543265	They said that core gamers dealt better with the scares than the apparently wussy casual players.
8543925	8548787	But they all experienced rapidly increased heart rate, stunted breathing, and a rise in skin temperature.
8550608	8550768	And...
8553502	8557103	There were pretty vocal about some of it too.
8557223	8560244	Like one of them started screaming, oh my god, oh my god, this shit is so scary.
8560264	8565125	It sounds like Shane when they're playing Silent Hill or something.
8565865	8575428	Other games that were considered but not found scary enough were Left 4 Dead 2, Gears of War 2, Condemned 2, Fear 1 and 2, Dead Space 1, and Silent Hill Homecoming, Alone in the Dark, and Mass Effect 2.
8578318	8606040	I told you about how Silent Hill Homecoming made me basically scream like a little girl and go shut the front door that had blown open from the wind and oh my god that was a horrible night hearts like who sits at home alone in the dark and plays Silent Hill you're just asking for it remember when Miklatov was visiting a while back and played through Silent Hill 2 and we were all curled up in your living room like on the couch in the dark watching him play I don't think I was in there
8606977	8607878	Actually, no, you weren't.
8607918	8608498	You weren't there.
8608638	8616022	I was there, and it was like, I think Irene was there, and Eddie, I think Eddie was there.
8617382	8618143	But yeah, it was pretty funny.
8619483	8622665	Well, Christopher was there, because it was when you were living with Christopher.
8622965	8624606	Ah, no, I probably just was out.
8624926	8625466	Yeah, you were gone.
8626567	8631149	I was probably on a hot date while you nerds were playing Silent Hill.
8632310	8633130	Dude, that shit was awesome.
8633590	8634771	All right, Loki.
8636116	8642462	Um, so of course, you know, one of the pioneers of Project $10 was EA.
8643023	8649589	And EA's been doing this for a while now, since June of last year, starting with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.
8650570	8660039	They were including basically a voucher in their new games that allowed you to get, you know, online access, their online pass, if you will.
8660899	8669023	and if you bought the game used, well, that might not be in there and so you would have to pay $10 to be able to play online.
8669143	8674865	Well, EA has come out and said that they have made between $10 and $15 million from online pass and
8681569	8692337	Apparently the revenues they said that they derived from that haven't been dramatic since they initiated the program, but it's not a failure at all.
8693077	8697260	And when you consider that, that's spread across quite a few games.
8698201	8703425	Tiger Woods, NCAA football, both years for NCAA football and Madden.
8703705	8704946	EA does a lot of sports games.
8705066	8705867	EA, MMA...
8709167	8709788	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8733809	8761313	and really they only have to that's you know 1 million about 1 million people that have bought into this so split that across you know over 5 games or whatever that's you know quite a significant amount I guess but 200,000 per title you know split across platforms and stuff wow they you know despite what do you want to call the number big or small or whatever EA made money appear out of nowhere
8762461	8763301	Yeah, good for them.
8763482	8764402	It's not deserving.
8764562	8771566	I don't think that they need that money because, once again, their complaint was, oh, well, those people that buy the game used.
8771706	8774768	The tax breaks they're getting from the government just aren't enough.
8774848	8776408	Did you read about that this week?
8776428	8777289	Oh, yeah, I read about that.
8777789	8786694	Yeah, and their excuse, well, those people that are buying used, we can't support the online if they're buying the game used because we don't see any of their revenue.
8788012	8797243	Yeah, that's a nice way to spin it except for the fact that the person that first bought that game brand new already paid you that money to keep up your network.
8798604	8799646	It's too damn bad.
8800406	8800927	Suck it up.
8801968	8802609	You're EA.
8803009	8803850	You can survive.
8805580	8806501	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8829978	8831919	Anyway, but this is a game.
8832739	8834180	It's a free-to-download game.
8834240	8837461	It's in beta right now, and it's a game called Oniken.
8838361	8845223	Oniken is, I guess, a tribute to challenging 8-bit action games from the NES.
8846364	8858068	They say that the game is actually NES hard, and there's a little clip here I'm going to play in studio, and I think DarkSakura would be into this because it looks a bit like the guy's weapon he's using is very Strider-esque.
8859813	8862374	But yeah, once again, this is not like a NES ROM.
8862654	8863955	Oh my god, it does look like a Cypher.
8864876	8865216	Doesn't it?
8865776	8871559	This is actually designed to be a game on the PC that is just NES tribute, NES style hard.
8871619	8874821	I don't know if that means like, we're talking La Mulana or what.
8875221	8877282	It's like Bionic Commando.
8877982	8879043	No, not to me.
8879623	8880704	Well, like the backgrounds.
8881164	8883445	Oh yeah, the artwork is very Bionic Commando.
8883465	8884426	It's about the gameplay.
8884446	8885586	No, nothing like it though. ...
8888968	8889969	It looks really fun though.
8891972	8893454	Fast forward to some of these other levels.
8894035	8898881	Dude, that almost looks like a rip of the Ninja Gaiden sprite from the original game.
8898921	8900864	Like they just switched it up a little bit.
8900944	8903607	Like even his stance and the way he moves and stuff like that.
8903848	8904589	A little bit, huh?
8905029	8908870	Apparently what's available right now to play, three missions in the game.
8909950	8913571	Oniken, again is the name of the game, O-N-I-K-E-N.
8914371	8917032	Lots of good visuals and so forth.
8917092	8925534	If you want to check it out for yourself, oniken.net, H-T-T-P, colon slash slash, www.oniken.net.
8925614	8928075	And I will go ahead and paste that in chat for the live listeners.
8928155	8930356	Those of you on the podcast, I hope you were writing quickly.
8931736	8935959	or maybe I can get DarkSakura to Tumblr at least the video there so you guys can check that out.
8936680	8937520	Did you link it?
8937641	8938121	Oh, there it is.
8938181	8938401	Yeah.
8938541	8940523	Okay, I'll put it on the thing.
8940883	8941183	Cool.
8942344	8942984	That was kind of fun.
8943185	8943905	I had to check that out.
8945266	8946087	Big Brother Blade?
8946407	8947568	I like the fact that it's free.
8947588	8948108	Or Ogre Blade?
8949229	8949549	Maybe?
8950330	8950830	Ogre Blade?
8951651	8952972	Free is my favorite word.
8953812	8954413	Absolutely.
8955694	8958175	How about we open up the phone line and take some of your calls right now?
8958195	8961477	1-877-GAME-OLR Speaking of free, you can call us free on that line.
8961897	8964418	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8964638	8971782	If you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight or if you have something gaming related that we haven't quite got to yet, we will talk about that as well.
8972302	8977005	Meanwhile, we're going to fire up the Twitter and get to some of your tweets this week at twitter.com.
8979667	8980747	Going to the tweets real quick.
8981308	8982729	Jvmon sent us a tweet tonight.
8983129	8985531	When did WoW, Warcraft, get so fun?
8985972	8987153	I can't stop playing.
8987473	8988154	I blame you.
8988254	8988954	Hugs and kisses.
8989995	8990896	When Cataclysm hit.
8991716	8998442	It's so interesting because to a lot of the hardcore, so to speak, Cataclysm was not so well received.
8998942	8999963	So it's very interesting.
9000263	9005668	I think the changing of the level 1 to 60 areas, though, is great for those that weren't quite yet into WoW.
9006337	9008538	So, I think that was kind of cool, I guess.
9010018	9012059	But yeah, Cataclysm hasn't been all bad news.
9012119	9018021	It's just I think the early game is much more improved than the end game was, if that makes sense.
9018721	9020562	Anyhow, we got calls coming in, so let's go to it.
9020602	9021642	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9021662	9022062	Who's this?
9022683	9023843	It's the one and only Ranma.
9024003	9024423	Hey, Ranma.
9024443	9025083	What's on your mind, buddy?
9026164	9029045	Oh, last week's podcast.
9029065	9030285	That's what's on my mind tonight.
9030745	9031326	Why is that?
9031406	9032226	It was long, wasn't it?
9033140	9041899	Yes, yes, it was long, and that was the first time in history I've had to listen to it again just to absorb all that...
9043936	9045236	Big G Bullshit
9074321	9079168	I strongly believe that Square Enix didn't do anything wrong.
9080049	9084376	The big G is just butt hurt and they're blowing smoke up people's asses.
9085825	9086285	I don't know.
9086646	9091009	I do think it was in bad form for Squeenix to spring that on people.
9091469	9096653	And I think GameStop had the right to know what was in that box and choose not to sell it.
9097074	9106921	And as I said, I don't want to repeat myself from last week, but as I said, the correct answer was what they finally did too late was just push the game back to Squeenix and refuse to sell it.
9107822	9110044	If they'd just done that to begin with, there wouldn't have been a problem.
9110748	9115750	To be perfectly honest, I do not believe the whole 48 hours thing.
9116031	9127896	Now, during my time working in these big chain companies, when companies like Square, Nintendo, and everybody else, when they're going to do something like that, they send a notice out.
9128497	9134259	Usually about two to three weeks prior, before do this.
9135520	9137581	So, I really believe that
9138763	9142965	The Big G knew about this, but they were just waiting what to do, what to do.
9143405	9153051	So, I feel that they decided, oh, let's wait about this time, pull the code out, and just start all it is.
9153491	9157153	Part of it could have been a publicity stunt, which I find hard to...
9158226	9162507	But from my retail experience, I don't believe that they just found out two days prior.
9162887	9164308	That's a good point.
9164328	9167688	Because I don't understand how any other chain had an issue with it.
9167808	9168349	You know what I'm saying?
9168369	9172650	It does seem like the memo went out to pull those codes really early on.
9172950	9174110	Like, you know, I don't know.
9174830	9175970	But what do you think, though?
9176511	9178811	Did you buy Deus Ex on PC out of curiosity?
9179591	9179851	No.
9180912	9182292	Okay, let's assume you had.
9182852	9183052	Yes.
9183932	9186073	Do you think you would have used that coupon for OnLive?
9187366	9190527	Probably not, no.
9190608	9192729	I don't think that coupon's really that big a deal.
9192789	9201092	I think people are going to go use it to check out on live and go, ooh, that's kind of neat, and play it for five minutes and then be done with it.
9201112	9203854	It's not like Portal or something.
9204174	9207035	It's not as rich as that kind of connection.
9207515	9211898	But it was just the whole thought that, oh my gosh, they're taking out a $50 coupon.
9213746	9215207	And here's another thing.
9215267	9216947	Remember, Valve did the same thing.
9217087	9220889	I don't remember the big G having an issue with it.
9221129	9225271	I don't believe the whole spin on how they had this agreement with Valve, you know.
9226311	9235695	Because to be perfectly honest, let's say Square Enix says, oh, because of this, we're no longer selling our products to you.
9236718	9242581	and you know since Square Enix is one of the big players out there, it would not surprise me if other manufacturers were like, you know?
9242861	9243361	That's a note.
9244042	9258449	I don't think it's as easy as that because, you know, Evil G, or as I like to call him, the Evil Genius, the Evil Genius has a huge hold on, you know, the share of the games that they push through is gigantic.
9259009	9261711	True, but I prefer to call them Gazpacho Stop.
9265239	9267321	I'm sure we could sit here and think of names all day.
9267741	9267981	I know.
9290399	9290999	of the price.
9291759	9294840	Wherever you bought it from, by law, they have to give you the difference.
9295040	9296160	State or federal?
9296340	9297020	State or federal?
9298200	9298420	What?
9299001	9300281	There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
9300341	9303321	If there's a price drop within 30 days, they have to give you the difference.
9303341	9304502	State law or federal law?
9304762	9308462	That doesn't sound like a law at all.
9308522	9309202	It's consumer law.
9309242	9310663	It's one of the things I had to learn about.
9310703	9314243	But is that consumer law for New York or is it for federal?
9314843	9315804	That might be the deal, Rama.
9315844	9317544	It might be because I've never heard of that here either.
9318205	9320668	I do know it's New York State law.
9320989	9323873	Also, same thing in Jersey, Connecticut, and a bunch of other states.
9324113	9330122	So it would not surprise me if it's a federal law, but you know how some people do that whole federal law dance thing.
9330162	9333447	It's one of those things we don't get out here on the West Coast, like hurricanes.
9335353	9336794	Which I slept through, by the way.
9337455	9338356	I heard a lot of people did.
9338416	9340798	I don't mean to make light of a bad situation.
9341259	9344542	Unfortunately, people in Vermont did not fare as well as people in New York City, from what I understand.
9345342	9345803	Pretty much.
9345943	9346624	Hope everybody's alright.
9346644	9348025	Alright, we're going to let you go, Ranma.
9348665	9348946	Thank you.
9349246	9349646	Take care, buddy.
9350527	9350847	Bye.
9351868	9352129	All right.
9352829	9355512	I want to go into this aside real quick before we take another call.
9355532	9362137	We got more calls coming in, but I want to do this real quick because we were talking about scary games earlier, and several people in the chat room brought up Amnesia.
9363038	9363999	And here's the thing, though.
9364019	9368803	The story of the Dark Sakura was about 360 games, and Amnesia is a PC-only game.
9368883	9369364	However—
9369844	9370404	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9393290	9394171	I've never seen these.
9394211	9398134	This could be a horrible segment, but I want to try playing one of these on air here.
9399875	9400735	What is this called here?
9401356	9402417	I don't want your stupid advertisement.
9402437	9403317	Let me get through the advertisement.
9403637	9407280	This is Funny Freakouts Here to Amnesia.
9408641	9410182	Let me get to this.
9412564	9413224	Let's see.
9413324	9415305	A Funtage, I guess they're calling this.
9415366	9415966	He says a minute 33.
9416026	9416867	Let me start it there.
9432908	9435810	Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, no, good, good, good.
9435830	9436410	Shut up, shut up.
9436450	9442212	In there, in there, hide, in there, get in there, jump in, jump in, close the door, close, close both doors, both doors, both doors, stop, stop, close, close, close, close.
9442232	9442632	No, don't take it.
9442652	9455858	Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
9456405	9458126	Oh, oh, Jesus Christ!
9458266	9459726	Oh, Jesus Christ!
9459767	9460467	No!
9460507	9460807	No!
9461007	9461527	Run!
9461647	9462048	Run!
9462308	9462728	Run!
9463068	9463388	Run!
9463588	9465089	Where do I go?
9465309	9465969	I hide in there!
9466209	9467530	I hide over here!
9467630	9468590	I love you!
9469651	9470131	Jesus!
9474133	9475213	Run!
9478835	9483377	See, that's the problem, is that when you do 360-only games, you can't include amnesia.
9484537	9485838	I don't want to pay 20 bucks for that.
9486517	9487277	I have amnesia.
9487297	9492540	You should come over and we should make a reaction video to amnesia because we'll both scream like 12-year-old girls.
9492640	9492880	We will.
9493220	9495961	I want it, but I don't want to pay 20 bucks for it.
9496262	9496682	I have it.
9496822	9498102	You should come over one night.
9499103	9500203	We could do this on Halloween.
9500423	9501264	Okay.
9502404	9504905	Were we talking about this at breakfast or was it talking about with Salacious Pop?
9504985	9505446	I'm getting old.
9505486	9506006	I forget things.
9506206	9507107	We talked about it this morning.
9507127	9511354	We talked about it at breakfast because we were talking about Castlevania or something.
9511454	9513457	I was like, no, we got to play something really scary.
9513497	9517002	We got to play Amnesia, which I have yet to... I bought it, but I haven't played it yet.
9517523	9519806	So you'd get some genuine reactions out of me.
9520106	9521128	Okay, I'll do that.
9521168	9521669	I'll be down for that.
9525137	9527699	We might have to have an OLR Halloween special.
9527979	9530821	Kind of like Nickelodeon would do.
9530841	9533362	The Mark Summers Halloween mansion or whatever.
9533403	9537925	We'll have to do Amnesia Night with DarkSakura, Rob Roberts, and maybe Loki.
9538146	9538426	You hear?
9539547	9541988	You know when I scream to when my voice goes away?
9542008	9542549	Be quiet.
9544090	9544450	All right.
9545711	9547072	Let's get to some more calls.
9548192	9550754	We've made these people wait through amnesia reaction videos.
9550774	9551735	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9551755	9552035	Who's this?
9554025	9554626	Hey, what's up, guys?
9554666	9555226	This is Kaijudo.
9555246	9555687	Can you hear me?
9555847	9556388	Yes, we can.
9556408	9557048	Hiya, Kaijudo.
9557068	9557389	What's up?
9558229	9558770	Hey, not much.
9558810	9563095	I just wanted to tell you, Rob, last week you spoke about the game Covert Action.
9563515	9565197	Yes, Sid Meier's Covert Action.
9565697	9566678	Yeah, that was actually my favorite game.
9566698	9568540	And that's the CIA calling you right now.
9569822	9569982	Hello?
9570002	9570102	Hello?
9570990	9571811	Hi, we can hear you.
9572371	9578677	Okay, anyway, that was a favorite game of mine too, and I found it about three years ago.
9580118	9588765	You can play it for free online on the PC, and also, you might like this, you'll be able to play it on your Nintendo DS if you have an R4 card.
9589486	9591828	I actually play it while I'm in the bathroom.
9594030	9595731	Doing some espionage of your own.
9595771	9597753	Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where I do my best work, man.
9599901	9602301	So yeah, if you have an R4 card, it's really simple.
9602321	9603682	I'm pretty sure Loki can help you out.
9603802	9611843	You get the R4 card, you get the covert action ROM somewhere online where you can find it, and then there's like some type of application.
9611883	9615684	I think it, because I have a few of them on my R4, so I don't know which one it is.
9615724	9625926	I think it's the Apple II emulator that you can put on your DS with the R4 that gives you the covert action, or it might be one of the others, but it's real easy to find.
9625946	9626486	Wow.
9627947	9629989	I don't have an R4 cartridge.
9630149	9631330	I have a spare R4.
9631350	9633251	Maybe Loki will let me borrow one of his.
9634552	9635112	That's awesome.
9635232	9636093	I loved Covert Action.
9636133	9637514	I don't know what it is about that game either.
9637874	9640116	Dude, Sid Meier, he's the man.
9640576	9642258	He's made so many good games.
9642978	9644579	And he doesn't like that game for some reason.
9644799	9649020	I think you mentioned yesterday people said that it was like too many games in one.
9649180	9654883	Sid Meier, that was actually Sid Meier said that they tried to do too much in one game.
9654943	9660004	It was like four separate games that none of them were really fully realized.
9660585	9665366	And to be fair, the driving game was always kind of dumb anyway.
9665767	9669368	The best part was the actual one where you broke in to the facilities.
9669388	9669468	Yeah.
9669628	9670729	Cryptogram, Switchboard Puzzles, Logic Puzzles
9699782	9700443	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9715117	9716317	to play that version of the game.
9716617	9719558	Now, Actdeft in chat says Piracy Lounge Radio.
9719698	9722439	No, no, I legit own this game back in the day.
9722499	9723419	Thank you very much.
9723659	9727860	And just to let them know, the game is officially free online.
9727900	9729081	It's not like you're pirating the game.
9729881	9732222	There's somewhere where they provide it to you for free.
9732662	9733302	And also, the...
9734557	9735637	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9752771	9754092	Okay, this game looks awesome.
9755153	9756313	Oh, it's Cthulhu Saves the World.
9756714	9757454	Yeah, I've never played it.
9757534	9759716	Yeah, those are on Xbox Live Indie Marketplace.
9759776	9762417	I'm going to hang up and let you get to your next call.
9762618	9764139	Thank you for being courteous, Kaijudo.
9764159	9764859	That's very nice of you.
9765359	9765860	Take care, buddy.
9766280	9769542	Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death 7 are three bucks.
9771263	9772864	I want to say there was a story one week.
9773104	9773885	I don't remember how long ago.
9774225	9781290	They sold more on Steam of those games in one weekend than they did the entire time the game was on Xbox Live Indie Arcade.
9781790	9782031	Wow.
9782431	9783793	But of course, the games are like really cheap.
9783813	9784234	They're fun.
9784595	9784975	They're cute.
9784995	9789302	They're definitely a throwback to the old school Super Nintendo RPGs with humor.
9790023	9792267	I like the Cthulhu one because Cthulhu is cute.
9793569	9794931	Did you ever see Hello Cthulhu?
9796790	9797250	Yes, I have.
9797290	9798771	It's like the Hello Kitty doll, but it's Cthulhu.
9798951	9803192	Well, it's actually Cthulhu ending up in the Sanrio universe and corrupting Hello Kitty.
9804393	9804533	Cool.
9804553	9806694	The person only did like a few of them, but they're super funny.
9806774	9811015	Would that look like the Hello Kitty in the Ursula outfit doll that I bought Salacious Pop?
9811575	9813416	No, it's just a super cute Cthulhu.
9814396	9818458	Like a little SD Sanrio style Cthulhu hanging out with a gothed out kitty.
9818638	9821919	I still really want you to have your World of Warcraft character named Ursulol.
9822532	9825293	Well, maybe I'll remake Fatty Cakes into Ursula.
9825333	9826733	But Fatty Cakes is a good name, too.
9827534	9828134	I'll make Ursula.
9828174	9829434	Alright, let's go to another call.
9829494	9830354	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
9830374	9830715	Who's this?
9831355	9832215	Legend of Zaku here.
9832255	9832715	Hey, buddy.
9832735	9833275	How you doing?
9834056	9835376	Pretty good, as usual.
9836116	9836436	Good, good.
9836456	9836756	What's up?
9838457	9838537	Uh...
9839198	9853404	I guess what I wanted to bring up was the fact that Activision is kind of like trying to get the folks currently on the fence like myself from Modern Warfare 3 on the PC by just like re-adding things that they took out.
9853645	9857986	Case in point, LAN support, in addition to adding dedicated servers.
9858026	9863149	So it's like, I don't know, on one hand they're trying to make a man's brand, on the other it's
9864680	9866862	I have to believe it has to be a bait and switch.
9867122	9871326	Interesting, because I remember hearing that they took it out, but I did not hear about them putting it back in.
9871386	9873228	That was for Modern Warfare 2.
9873828	9874269	Interesting.
9875370	9879673	Yeah, so Modern Warfare 3 will actually have land support.
9879974	9889322	We know Blizzard is a huge part of Activision, obviously, and they've come under fire lately because StarCraft 2 does not have the land, and Diablo 3 is not going to have it either.
9890089	9893171	Yeah, they're all going to be online for better or for worse.
9893612	9897295	I hate to say it, but I sort of support it with Diablo 3.
9897575	9897895	I don't know.
9898175	9898676	Here's the thing.
9899256	9903019	The thing with Diablo 3 is that, let's face it, Diablo 2 was hacked to hell and back.
9903660	9906022	You can't play that game online with strangers.
9906122	9906862	It's so broken.
9907163	9909004	You can really only play with people you trust.
9909384	9915609	I think if they had kept a LAN campaign separate from an online campaign, they could have done it.
9916010	9918672	It's kind of disappointing, but there's always Torchlight 2.
9920458	9921319	Well, that does help.
9921859	9925902	The $20 price tag that was confirmed this week helps too.
9927203	9946396	Right now, I guess I could I'll probably give them the benefit of the doubt, but seeing this Activision and the fact that they reneged on it back in Modern Warfare 2 when they promised that they were going to have dedicated servers and so forth, only to find out a few weeks before launch that it was quite the opposite.
9947397	9948978	So I don't want to get fooled again.
9951144	9955028	What did you think of the whole Call of Duty Expo that they did, the Call of Duty XP or whatever?
9955108	9961014	I heard bits and pieces, like people actually doing paintball matches to some of the maps in there.
9961955	9968442	I mean, it's like, I guess they're trying to hype it up to the point where, you know, it's all marketing at this point.
9968722	9968903	Mm-hmm.
9969443	9988958	I mean, the idea is that Call of Duty is for, you know, quote-unquote kind of like the douchebags game of choice in that regard, whereas Battlefield 3 is mostly for the hardcore nerd gamer that plays these types of FPSs like Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.
9988998	9994261	That's the type of demographic I see EA targeting, you know, with BF3.
9995382	9998425	Whereas Call of Duty is kind of like the dumbed-down, basic...
10000219	10004127	That's like the one they're trying to get everyone on board with.
10005029	10006391	It was like a frat boy type game.
10008154	10013558	I know I'm generalizing, and you can sue me if you want, but I'm just... No, it's fine.
10014018	10018221	I'm so uneducated on all those games, and it's not that I dislike them.
10018241	10020923	They're just not my thing, and I suck at them.
10020943	10021803	I'm so terrible at them.
10022083	10023304	It's like some people in DDR.
10023344	10027547	Some people think DDR is just... What the hell is that music that's coming out of that machine?
10027587	10028668	You know, and not everybody gets it.
10028688	10029388	Right, right.
10029408	10030069	But I mean, the...
10030789	10040999	I guess what Activision is banking on is the mere fact that they can sell a shitload of copies of that game, of Modern Warfare, without having to change a lot.
10041980	10049008	And hoping that as long as you hype it up to the point where they kind of need to have it, are also going to be the...
10051242	10054845	The Unluckiest Kid in the Block without their copy of Call of Duty.
10055545	10068115	It's kind of like they're trying to create a mindset where you have to one-up your friend or your neighbors and covet that copy of Call of Duty that he has.
10069656	10076081	Whereas Battlefield 3, on the other hand, is going for more detail, more replay, more
10077335	10081297	Let's just say a lot more features than what Activision is offering.
10081437	10085360	It's aiming towards being a simulator.
10085420	10086680	A military simulator.
10087241	10088681	Are most people just going to get both?
10089662	10090262	Yeah, you're right.
10090282	10091203	They're going to get both.
10091283	10099447	But I could see a lot of those uneducated regular token gamers are going to just get Modern Warfare 3.
10100648	10102469	The really hardcore ones, they're going to get both.
10102989	10105031	They're going to balance time in between the two.
10105371	10105551	Yep.
10107132	10110677	It's kind of like there's so much I want to play this holiday season.
10110777	10112499	Well, isn't that the case every holiday?
10112859	10119927	Somehow I will have to juggle my time between Skyrim, Diablo 3, Torchlight 2, and God knows what else I'm forgetting.
10120208	10121389	Mario Kart on the 3DS.
10121950	10124393	I thought Diablo 3 wasn't coming out this year.
10124653	10125213	I think it will.
10126014	10131637	They haven't said one way or the other, but the friends and family beta is going on right now, which means the public beta is probably next month.
10132137	10135359	I think they're going to announce at BlizzCon that it's coming out within the next month.
10136100	10138721	Why wouldn't they try to make end of year and have a huge thing?
10138741	10141382	Because Blizzard hasn't released anything else this year.
10141843	10145004	They don't release Diablo, they've released nothing.
10145044	10150127	And they still have to get the expansion pack for StarCraft 2, which is probably next year anyways.
10150307	10152009	Diablo 3 and an expansion and two WoW expansions.
10169540	10169980	That's it.
10170080	10171881	Which makes sense.
10172061	10175862	And pretty much all of them are going to be on PC unless they do second-hand ports.
10176723	10179023	I guarantee Diablo 3 will end up on consoles.
10179243	10181104	It's just not going to be the same time as PC.
10182244	10186726	Yeah, and this is why you always want to, with Blizzard, it's always PC or nothing.
10187186	10189967	People forget Diablo was on the PlayStation.
10190447	10191348	StarCraft was on the 64.
10191408	10194789	Some things are better left forgotten.
10195249	10195389	Yeah.
10195973	10202179	Yeah, some things are better left forgotten than Blizzard's half-assed ports of their properties back in the day.
10202739	10204381	You know, Warcraft comes to mind.
10205061	10209825	It's been 15 years since Diablo on the PlayStation 1, so it's worth a try.
10210446	10212988	I enjoyed it on my PC.
10213108	10213529	Enough said.
10213829	10216931	Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show and have fun.
10217711	10218412	Alright, take care, buddy.
10219012	10219532	Have a good one.
10219992	10221813	I think he's gonna be broke this holiday season, too.
10221833	10223754	I forgot to ask him how much money he plans to spend.
10224355	10226016	Alright, sadly, that's gonna do it for the Skyplane.
10226036	10228357	I want someone with money to get me a Moonkin Hashling.
10230058	10230818	They're what, ten bucks?
10230978	10231278	Yeah.
10231599	10232259	That's not too bad.
10232779	10234420	But it's virtual pets.
10234720	10235060	I know.
10235080	10237202	That's why I said I want someone else to do it.
10237222	10239443	How about I donate ten dollars to a charity in your honor?
10239463	10239803	Uh-oh.
10241098	10241358	Okay.
10241478	10241778	All right.
10241798	10242599	Dude, what the hell?
10243359	10244219	All right, moving on.
10244519	10246480	I want to finish up the tweets so we can finish up the show tonight.
10247140	10248841	We just had a handful of other tweets.
10249501	10253743	An interesting one from Tiger Claw tweeting OLR at twitter.com slash OLR.
10254103	10258845	Study suggests virtual goods purchasing differs by ethnicity.
10259145	10263127	Oh boy, this could be a... All right, let's see what this is all about.
10265920	10271762	This is an article from Gamasutra that we were linked to on Twitter by user TigerClaw305.
10272602	10280105	New study published Friday by mobile game community MocoSpace suggests that virtual goods purchasing behavior may be affected by ethnicity.
10280805	10289247	A survey of anonymous data from 40,000 mobile social gamers revealed that both Caucasians and African Americans over-indexed on virtual goods spendings.
10289667	10298249	Caucasians in particular were responsible for 26% of virtual goods purchases made during the study period, despite representing only 18% of those studied.
10298790	10301150	African Americans made up 36% of the respondents and made 38% of the purchases.
10304591	10311934	Those calling those Hispanic under-indexed despite compromising 31% of the sample pool, they made only 21% of the purchases.
10312474	10313634	All right, what does this all mean?
10314054	10315275	Numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers.
10315315	10315895	What does this mean?
10316475	10324378	According to MocoSpace CEO Justin Siegel, the rapid growth of virtual goods industry means that it, quote, makes sense to really start segmenting it.
10324798	10326819	I'm not really understanding, like, how, but whatever.
10349963	10352225	People get paid to break that data down, just so you know.
10352365	10353545	Somebody got paid to do that study.
10355487	10357548	Last tweet to us tonight from WatchDragon.
10358229	10360270	Beat Space Marine on hard.
10360330	10361090	What is Space Marine?
10361110	10361771	Is that just Halo?
10362792	10365213	No, it's Warhammer 4 UK Space Marine.
10365433	10367575	Aha, that would explain the rest of this tweet.
10367995	10369796	I play the tabletop Warhammer.
10369936	10371397	It's true to the story and fluff.
10372818	10373238	And fluff.
10374920	10375360	Very cool.
10376721	10379143	Thank you for educating me, Loki, because I did not pick that up.
10379843	10381524	I did not play Warhammer Tabletop.
10381564	10384666	The only Warhammer I've ever played was that MMO they put out a couple years ago.
10385147	10386748	You played Warhammer Tabletop, didn't you, DarkSakura?
10386788	10387348	Hell no.
10387608	10388649	I dated someone who did.
10389450	10395014	Oh, that's... So sick of those stupid little... Oh, you had figurine trauma in that relationship.
10395254	10400497	Yes, because... I tried playing Warhammer 40k Space Marine.
10400837	10405080	Warhammer 40k Space Marine was more of the larger scale... Well...
10406221	10411849	Larger scale battles, smaller scale figurines, the actual Space Marines are 6mm tall figurines.
10412510	10413451	I did not paint those.
10414012	10416936	I tried painting them, I'm like, fuck that, it's too damn small.
10418647	10419007	Alright.
10419167	10420248	And I threw it all away.
10420628	10422749	Because I'm like, I don't get this game.
10422769	10425030	I haven't played Dungeons and Dragons in like four years.
10425250	10426191	I should play sometime.
10426331	10426631	I don't know.
10426711	10428311	God, I sound like a total nerd.
10428351	10429252	Maybe I didn't throw it away.
10429592	10431453	I think I might have it in a box somewhere.
10432553	10432894	Alright.
10433514	10434974	That does it for Twitter topics tonight.
10435054	10435875	Tweet us for next week.
10435915	10437656	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10437996	10440337	Let's go to Loki and see if he has any last minute stories.
10441918	10446181	Just real quick, rookies won't appear in NBA 2K12 until lockout's over.
10448362	10450804	There's going to be an update or something like that for free.
10450884	10452124	Lockouts are ruining everything.
10452305	10454846	Once that happens, you won't be able to play as the rookies.
10458129	10464115	Um, there's a mysterious move game in development from the people that did, uh, Linger in Shadows.
10464135	10472584	Remember that really weird dog flying thing with the basset hound and the shadow creature that looked like the squid from the Matrix or whatever?
10472604	10474786	Actually, I don't remember that and it's probably for the best.
10475512	10477474	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10498460	10521342	they could very well be like trying to put some sort of touch sensitive glove or something in the play because almost like all this stuff is just focusing on the textures of different things and obviously with the movie you're not going to be able to feel any of that so I don't know but right now weird video that's online so you can check it out and that's pretty much it
10524565	10528649	Alright, well, this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10528969	10530590	So, DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
10530670	10531591	Your final thought tonight.
10532412	10532812	Duffy.
10534494	10536615	My final thought tonight is tacos!
10537056	10537316	Again.
10538177	10540118	And bacon cupcakes, causing sugar headaches.
10541399	10543321	Those cupcakes, single-handedly, are going to make me diabetic.
10543361	10544602	I have a sugar headache right now.
10544722	10545123	I know, right?
10545143	10547465	That's why I ran to get water during one of the reports.
10547925	10548365	Crazy.
10548886	10551228	Anyway, Loki, your final thought tonight.
10551656	10556918	My final thought is I made a flamethrower in Grand Theft Auto and no one else has.
10557778	10558998	And happy birthday once again.
10559158	10559458	Thank you.
10560018	10561399	So I hope you had a good one.
