2
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:38,478

00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:06,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,180
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you, Ms.

9
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Summers?

10
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:08,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Hungry.

11
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,530
[SPEAKER_10]: You're hungry?

12
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,012
[SPEAKER_10]: But it looks like you're eating over there, so you're getting that hunger problem fixed, right?

13
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:13,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

14
00:01:13,713 --> 00:01:14,694
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very nutritious.

15
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:16,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Nutritious, delicious?

16
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:18,857
[SPEAKER_07]: It's brown rice and tempeh with okonomiyaki sauce.

17
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:20,197
[SPEAKER_10]: I love brown rice and vegetables.

18
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:21,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

19
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:23,840
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worse than dog food.

20
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:25,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Dog-a-chow.

21
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:29,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Also say hello to the one, the only, Tech Master, Loki!

22
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:30,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

23
00:01:30,364 --> 00:01:31,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And how are you, Loki?

24
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fine.

25
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:36,709
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, to answer the question in our chat room, what did you get for dinner tonight?

26
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:45,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, well, I got another double bacon western burger, but I'm not even really that hungry.

27
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,094
[SPEAKER_09]: But I figured, you know, if I don't eat something, I'm going to be hungry later because I had a big lunch, but it was around 1.

28
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:59,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, if I don't eat anything between 1 o'clock and, you know, 11 o'clock or whatever, I'll probably be starving by 11.

29
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:12,037
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I had to hold me over for tonight's show is a Frappuccino That's the food I had this week But I will be getting something more substantial after the show Hey, it's pumpkin spice Frappuccino, it's really good

30
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:14,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is your kick with pumpkin spice lately?

31
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,107
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my favorite time of year.

32
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:16,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I love pumpkin.

33
00:02:16,747 --> 00:02:17,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I love pumpkin pie.

34
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:19,208
[SPEAKER_10]: They have pumpkin Pop-Tarts now.

35
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:24,211
[SPEAKER_10]: And oh my gosh, oh my gosh, they now make Hershey's Kisses that are pumpkin spice flavored.

36
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:26,872
[SPEAKER_10]: It's heaven.

37
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:28,253
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

38
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:30,293
[SPEAKER_10]: And they don't pay me to say that.

39
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:31,434
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is that good.

40
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:34,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Or to quote Rob from WOW last night, it tastes like world peace.

41
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:35,696
[SPEAKER_10]: It did taste like world peace.

42
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:39,438
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we do have a guest on tonight's show, at least going to join us for at least the first half here.

43
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:40,438
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

44
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,831
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay to use it for Orange Lounge Radio because that's how people know me here.

45
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:04,853
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand your nickname.

46
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,153
[SPEAKER_10]: When does Prince want to be Prince?

47
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:06,993
[SPEAKER_10]: He's always Prince.

48
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:08,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm like Prince 2.0.

49
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:11,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back to the show, Rice Princess.

50
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:11,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

51
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:13,575
[SPEAKER_10]: What's new in your world?

52
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:19,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me have you reintroduce yourself for those that are newer to Orange Lounge Radio who weren't here 100 episodes ago.

53
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:21,038
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a gamer girl, obviously.

54
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:23,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.

55
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.

56
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:24,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I've kind of

57
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:27,295
[SPEAKER_10]: What, you don't play games anymore?

58
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:27,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought you did.

59
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:31,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that I'm not interested in playing games, I just don't have time.

60
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,659
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would if I could.

61
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you been playing anything lately?

62
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:35,920
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

63
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:36,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

64
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:38,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Not, no.

65
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:42,684
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought you and your boyfriend had a Wii and at least were playing stuff on that, or is it mostly him?

66
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:44,606
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mostly him.

67
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:50,209
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a Gamefly account and he'll get games and then I'll watch him play them, but I just don't have the energy to play anything.

68
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then get off the show.

69
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,690
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

70
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,692
[SPEAKER_10]: But you do love your classic games at least, right?

71
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:57,113
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

72
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Your favorites.

73
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my favorite is Chrono Trigger.

74
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:16,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy Tactics.

75
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,573
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty close to Chrono Trigger.

76
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Metroid.

77
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:27,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Just really from the Super Nintendo era, most of the games on the Super Nintendo.

78
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:29,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Nintendo was just perfect gaming, wasn't it?

79
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:30,738
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the golden system.

80
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:31,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was.

81
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree in many ways.

82
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,060
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if gaming will ever be that good ever again.

83
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaming is just different now.

84
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:38,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it just is.

85
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially a game I was playing this week that I'll get into later in my gaming week.

86
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:44,159
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like interacting with a movie now.

87
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:44,400
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not...

88
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:47,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's not a bad thing.

89
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:54,226
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just, you know, and maybe this is a little bit of get off my lawn syndrome, but it's just not the same like it was.

90
00:04:54,526 --> 00:05:05,270
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, you know, okay, so if you have been listening for a while, you know that I hate Microsoft and like the Xbox systems that they have, but we actually ended up buying one.

91
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I finally allowed my boyfriend to have one in the house.

92
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:14,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is a huge deal because when you were on the show before, you were very staunch anti-Microsoft, anti-Xbox.

93
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:14,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but...

94
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:17,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what?

95
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:17,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I am.

96
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:19,810
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I just mean console-wise.

97
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't like Microsoft.

98
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:23,953
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Wii is a piece of shit.

99
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,434
[SPEAKER_06]: The PS3 is way too much, and they don't have any good games.

100
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:29,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just, he really wanted one, and I'm like, fine.

101
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:31,277
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I can't hold them back any longer.

102
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:35,559
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to admit that it's probably the best system out right now, console-wise.

103
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,703
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we get games on that console, I really feel like an idiot, like a retard.

104
00:05:41,763 --> 00:05:43,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

105
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:51,548
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all first person shooter controls and you kind of have to go to game college to learn the controls on these games.

106
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:52,188
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

107
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,689
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to go back and just play Puzzle Fighter HD Turbo all day?

108
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I want two buttons on my controller, god damn it.

109
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:00,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tired of all this stupid bullshit.

110
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:07,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it just takes a little bit more effort to learn how to play a game, but I don't know.

111
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:08,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the games are pretty good.

112
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:11,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here on the show tonight?

113
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:12,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually our guests want to plug something.

114
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:14,850
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not really.

115
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

116
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Thought I'd offer.

117
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:17,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, it's fine.

118
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:18,372
Yeah.

119
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:19,152
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

120
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you'll be joining us throughout the show and offer your witty insight and commentary.

121
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:23,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Please do.

122
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:24,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

123
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:25,875
[SPEAKER_10]: As we continue on throughout tonight's show.

124
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,196
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura wants her mic back.

125
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:28,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like your Avengers t-shirt.

126
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:31,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

127
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I just looked over and saw Ms.

128
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Marvel and it made me happy.

129
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:21,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I was fortunate when I was 17 years old I got to go to the Trade Center and I have a very vivid memory of being on the roof of the Trade Center but I drove by it with a big hole in it oh and you it was right after the bottom floor got bombed oh gosh when I was 17 wow and it's just you know the whole thing watching on a phone TV was just just just so difficult and everything and

130
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:37,413
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know we have a lot of listeners in New York City and back east and all those places that we're affected and it's like you know the impact we felt 3,000 miles away I can't even imagine just that experience so you know we should never forget what happened

131
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:38,694
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

132
00:07:54,951 --> 00:08:19,715
[SPEAKER_10]: uh if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise you wouldn't feel it no she wouldn't i do pet her with my foot though so i don't have to bend over as i was saying if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise kind of a tough day for some people uh then i think we've done our job so and uh fuck terrorists like seriously fuck them they suck so if we do what we do then they don't get it we can commemorate something else today

133
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:20,674
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

134
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:25,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on because something else monumental happened today, 31 years ago.

135
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:27,258
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what that is?

136
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:29,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki was born, everybody.

137
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,940
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Loki's birthday.

138
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

139
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:33,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy birthday, Loki.

140
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:42,787
[SPEAKER_10]: So in commemoration, it looks like Irene has actually brought over some bacon cupcakes for Loki.

141
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:43,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I love this.

142
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:44,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you get a picture up on the website?

143
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:44,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did.

144
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:45,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

145
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:47,630
[SPEAKER_07]: They should be on orangejonesradio.com.

146
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Go look at it now.

147
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll eat them later.

148
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't eat them right now.

149
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm too full from the other bacon stuff.

150
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I really shouldn't have eaten that.

151
00:08:55,112 --> 00:08:55,773
[SPEAKER_09]: It was too much.

152
00:08:55,793 --> 00:09:00,394
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, milkshake or bacon burger.

153
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,495
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, bacon burger.

154
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:03,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Should have gone for the milkshake.

155
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So, any good video game related loot for your birthday or not yet?

156
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:08,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

157
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:10,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, someone...

158
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I really hate not remembering.

159
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:17,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone gifted me an Xbox Live code last night.

160
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:22,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get to check what it was for yet.

161
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:24,569
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

162
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:28,092
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have to check that out.

163
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:28,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see...

164
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:33,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to look up real quick.

165
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:39,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Ryan Belknap gifted me something from Xbox Live.

166
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I will go check that out, and I really appreciate it.

167
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:45,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't really get on my Xbox today.

168
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:48,089
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, last night sucked.

169
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,972
[SPEAKER_09]: My cat was being an asshole, so I didn't get it.

170
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Heartland-y sleep, like maybe a few hours.

171
00:09:54,715 --> 00:10:07,604
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, he just, today I ended up sleeping in and then it was like out to lunch and then came back and started messing with Grand Theft Auto stuff, so didn't get a chance to boot it back up again, but, oh well.

172
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I hope your birthday is awesome and, uh, congratulations.

173
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:12,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

174
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:20,013
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all, we're all in our 30s now, so, uh, it's the, it's the podcast, oh, not, not, uh, Irene, but Chloe, you're just, you're just visiting tonight.

175
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:23,296
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, we're now the podcast for those in their mid-30s.

176
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:25,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

177
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:26,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

178
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand what's hip and cool nowadays.

179
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:29,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for Toy Trends.

180
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand that crap.

181
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:38,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're just making all sorts of weird shit up now and kids are just buying it and I don't get it.

182
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:39,613
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

183
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:46,178
[SPEAKER_07]: When kids are maybe about one and a half and younger, they don't care.

184
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,142
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll play with the box, save some money, and buy them a box.

185
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:56,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I seem to recall Josh, your kid, really loved the Kinect calibration card.

186
00:10:56,465 --> 00:10:56,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Still does.

187
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,327
[SPEAKER_10]: For real.

188
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:00,688
[SPEAKER_10]: The wacky, creepy, happy face.

189
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:01,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Babies are like cats.

190
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:06,918
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go buy the most expensive cat toy ever, but they don't care.

191
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,998
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to play with the twist ties and the box.

192
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:11,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you drop them from six feet, they'll land on all fours?

193
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:11,619
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

194
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:13,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I said they're light cats.

195
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't say they were cats.

196
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And besides that, it's not like they have clear vision until they're, you know, ten months old anyway.

197
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:23,923
[SPEAKER_09]: It is pretty true that they do like all sorts of random stuff.

198
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:28,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually, I mean, he'll chase after sunlight on the floor.

199
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,749
[SPEAKER_09]: So pretty much anything amuses him.

200
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:33,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Save money, everybody.

201
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:34,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't buy them toys.

202
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:35,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Buy them twist ties.

203
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:38,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm more loyal to games than systems anyway

204
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:07,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of an interesting comment, and I see Irene shaking her head over there.

205
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:08,512
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of that comment?

206
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:11,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I was nodding my head.

207
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:13,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Shaking it up and down, of course.

208
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:14,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, of course.

209
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:18,059
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean, I can understand that.

210
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, really, okay, when we grew up, we only had one system in the house at a time.

211
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:27,606
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have a Genesis and a Super Nintendo and all that stuff.

212
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:30,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we all grew up in families that couldn't afford that.

213
00:12:31,403 --> 00:12:31,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for you.

214
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:35,385
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I didn't have a Genesis and Nintendo and all that stuff at the same time.

215
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:35,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

216
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I only ever had Nintendo systems.

217
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I had Nintendo, Super Nintendo.

218
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:41,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I lied because then I had a PlayStation, but I didn't have a 64, so.

219
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

220
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been pretty loyal to my Nintendo.

221
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I threw away 64 one day.

222
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:45,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

223
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:52,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I bought it from my ex-girlfriend's brother at the time, and then I was just like, I don't want this, so I threw it away.

224
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:54,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So you just threw it away.

225
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we know who came from the richest household.

226
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:57,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

227
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,731
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it wasn't even, it was way late.

228
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:02,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I just decided one day I didn't want it anymore, so I threw it away.

229
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Carry on, carry on.

230
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:05,232
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was way later.

231
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:10,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, we're talking like in the 2000s when I bought the stupid Nintendo 64.

232
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,453
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't, you know...

233
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:15,173
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

234
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:32,239
[SPEAKER_07]: for like my graduation deal or something.

235
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:39,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my roommate's boyfriend left his PlayStation in the room because he didn't have a TV in my dorm room.

236
00:13:40,004 --> 00:13:43,546
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did have multiple systems, but it was because of circumstance.

237
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:49,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it all goes with the golden rule of gaming.

238
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Going back to the comment, you know, what we always say here on Orange Lounge Radio, system is only as good as the games that are on it.

239
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:55,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

240
00:13:56,693 --> 00:14:04,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I was very much an Xbox hater for the first generation of Xbox systems, but then after that, it was just kind of alright.

241
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:12,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when I borrowed my friend's Genesis, he had a PowerBase converter and tons of Master System games too, so...

242
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:17,291
[SPEAKER_10]: I think PlayStation 3 is coming an awfully long way, too.

243
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:21,494
[SPEAKER_10]: When they first came out, they were kind of the laughingstock of the industry, and for many good reasons.

244
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:28,139
[SPEAKER_10]: But despite the hack earlier this year, which I still say, Microsoft isn't as invulnerable as all y'all think.

245
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:31,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, I had $150 stolen just last month.

246
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:33,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a follow-up on that I'm going to get to in a minute, by the way.

247
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,484
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think PlayStation 3 is coming off a long way since then.

248
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they've got a lot of really good stuff going for them there.

249
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:42,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, LittleBigPlanet is one of my favorite games ever to come out this generation.

250
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:43,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of good stuff.

251
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:46,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, other things I want to talk about.

252
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:47,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I'll mention the Xbox Live hack.

253
00:14:48,093 --> 00:14:53,358
[SPEAKER_10]: If you go back about four weeks ago on the show, I talked about how I had money stolen from my Xbox Live account.

254
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:58,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Called Microsoft, was told that in 21 days they'd get the money back and whatever.

255
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:12,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I got an email from them about 25 days after, it was about Wednesday, saying that they apologized for the inconvenience, but they did the investigation and that they concluded it was indeed fraudulent and I will be getting the money back on my account.

256
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:18,272
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they sent me like three separate codes for one month of Xbox Live Gold.

257
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:26,616
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I guess the cool thing is, even though I haven't been able to play my Xbox for the past 21 days, 25 days, month, basically, I got the codes.

258
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:30,718
[SPEAKER_10]: So, now I got to extend out my Xbox Live Gold for three months.

259
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:39,883
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I guess that's cool, but I'm still waiting for the money because the email I got said, it may take up to 10 days for the money to actually get credited to your credit card or whatever.

260
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:42,084
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just like, oh my God, it's been over a month.

261
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:44,805
[SPEAKER_10]: That's 150 bucks I had to eat for a month.

262
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:46,866
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, luckily I have a savings account, but it's just...

263
00:15:48,307 --> 00:16:09,014
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of irritating I mean really it takes that long to figure out that a different IP and different MAC address Xbox probably in another country logged in and did it you know it's just come on but whatever at least it's on the path to getting fixed and I was able to finally play the 360 this week a little bit I'll talk in a moment about some things I was playing on there

264
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,160
[SPEAKER_10]: One other thing I want to bring up because I was thinking about this today.

265
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:20,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at Fry's, which obviously is a big retailer out here on the West Coast, a big electronics store, and was looking at 3DS games randomly.

266
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:23,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, Star Fox 64 just came out.

267
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:33,645
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was looking at the Namco Generations that just came out as well, which is, you know, for us folks that like our retro games, it's like a Pac-Man reimagining, Pac-Man Championship Edition.

268
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:34,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Galaga...

269
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:37,027
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Pac-Man and Galaga Legions.

270
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:39,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Dimensions, I'm sorry.

271
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Dimensions, so it's all 3D and all that stuff.

272
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:43,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was really tempted to get it.

273
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:43,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't.

274
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:44,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the thing.

275
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,534
[SPEAKER_10]: I looked at the price tag and I was like, it's $40.

276
00:16:46,735 --> 00:16:46,534
$40?

277
00:16:46,795 --> 00:16:47,996
[SPEAKER_10]: 3DS games are $40.

278
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:49,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that, but... I know, it's Pac-Man.

279
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,866
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting to me because they just recently cut the cost of the 3DS from $250 to $160.

280
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:03,149
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know if that's really the problem.

281
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:04,330
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem are those games.

282
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Those games are too expensive.

283
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:06,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll talk to my Namco guy.

284
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:10,195
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, dude, I got tons of 3DS games.

285
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:12,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I just ended up giving them away to my friends.

286
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:14,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, sweet, cool, send me some.

287
00:17:14,218 --> 00:17:14,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

288
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:17,421
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not gonna say no to that, that's for sure.

289
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:24,028
[SPEAKER_10]: But for the masses and everybody out there, and even other games, like Star Fox 64, I might have considered buying if it was $20.

290
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know why?

291
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:34,799
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because they claim that it's like, oh, well, it takes extra development time and stuff to develop the extra dimension or whatever it is.

292
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:38,940
[SPEAKER_09]: or maybe the dev kids cost a little more.

293
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:48,563
[SPEAKER_10]: The cost more for the other dimension is a load of turd because they came out and they said any game that uses a z-axis in calculation you can easily adapt it to 3D.

294
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:50,263
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just another virtual camera.

295
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:51,664
[SPEAKER_10]: It's ridiculous.

296
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody who says that that extra dimension should cost more money is full of crap.

297
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,806
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's just because it's a new generation they think they can up the prices.

298
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,508
[SPEAKER_10]: and I think that's going to be the problem holding it back.

299
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:16,499
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and it's interesting to me because there's been a lot of talk lately about how stubborn Nintendo has been and how much they have really not liked the mobile gaming stuff because 99 Cent Angry Birds has been cheapening quote unquote the game industry as a whole.

300
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:24,186
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm kind of like, well, I don't think 99 Cent Angry Birds is the reason why I feel like a $40 Pac-Man Galaga game is a rip-off.

301
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:26,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care how many dimensions the fucking game has.

302
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:30,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just like, $40 is a lot.

303
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:38,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo's dumb in the sense that they think that a game like Angry Birds, a very basic physics puzzler game, I mean...

304
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:40,142
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

305
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:09,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Done.

306
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,212
[SPEAKER_09]: 99 cents.

307
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,253
[SPEAKER_09]: You put it right out there, everyone will buy that shit.

308
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:18,617
[SPEAKER_10]: The price of all these games really has to make me stop and think about what I really want.

309
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, even $60 for a 360 or PlayStation 3 game is asking a lot of money.

310
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:26,363
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's only a certain kind of game that I'm willing to pay that for.

311
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:29,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Gone are the days that you would just pick up a game on a whim.

312
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:31,207
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

313
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:33,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, remember when you just, yeah, pick up a game on a whim.

314
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:34,429
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks interesting.

315
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:34,930
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try it.

316
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,071
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, those days really seem gone.

317
00:19:38,592 --> 00:19:43,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking at the holiday, there's so many games coming out, and I'm really having to choose, like, okay, I gotta drop 60 bucks on all these games.

318
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:44,737
[SPEAKER_10]: What am I actually gonna buy?

319
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:45,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Skyrim.

320
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:47,239
[SPEAKER_09]: See, that's the thing, though, is...

321
00:19:48,300 --> 00:20:03,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, gone are the days of buying something on a web, not necessarily playing something on a web, especially some, you know, how easy it is to pirate things nowadays on certain systems, so...

322
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:06,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but that's a whole nother Oprah.

323
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:06,683
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

324
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:10,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Not even going into the piracy angles.

325
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:12,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just say that most people don't do that.

326
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:12,812
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't.

327
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:14,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's a lot of stuff.

328
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,297
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll look at games that are coming out.

329
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:17,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, hey, you know what?

330
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,100
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be kind of cool to get.

331
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,861
[SPEAKER_09]: But then I ask myself...

332
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:34,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really going to play this because I have a lot of games that I buy and end up not really playing or finishing or something and I figure I should just finish the ones I have first and then buy the ones I really want and end up just not missing the ones I end up skipping on.

333
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:36,763
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, interesting comment in our chatroom.

334
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:42,007
[SPEAKER_10]: PartMachine in our chat says, if people played PC games, this would not be a problem.

335
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:50,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting that that comment is said because one of the places where I do buy things on a whim, just because they're cheap and they look interesting, is Steam.

336
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:56,538
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I bought a game on there for like $1.50 the other day.

337
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:56,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

338
00:20:56,898 --> 00:21:00,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it was $1.50 and it was a puzzler and it looked interesting and I like puzzle games.

339
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:03,196
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it sucks, it's only $1.50, right?

340
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:10,140
[SPEAKER_10]: So funny enough, that is the place where I tend to spend a little more frivolously.

341
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,541
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't...

342
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:13,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe he's right.

343
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:16,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, just like, you know, like virtual console stuff.

344
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:18,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember virtual console stuff?

345
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,741
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like six bucks a pop for NES games.

346
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:27,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, fuck, you can get those NES games in NES form on cartridges for a lot cheaper than that.

347
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:30,469
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just, I don't see the point.

348
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:31,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially when they're not doing anything.

349
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,951
[SPEAKER_09]: They're dumping a ROM into an emulator.

350
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:35,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Why should they give you money for that?

351
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:38,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I can go download that for free.

352
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:41,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this a rant about the Mario 25th anniversary collection disc?

353
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:42,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

354
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,000
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

355
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:08,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

356
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:29,866
[SPEAKER_09]: You only have yourself to blame for Nintendo having $40 games on the 3DS.

357
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:33,909
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because you're an idiot and you will buy this $30 Mario game.

358
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:34,850
[SPEAKER_09]: That's literally wrong.

359
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,975
[SPEAKER_09]: They could have put it on the Virtual Console, sold it for $10, and would have been the same damn game.

360
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:44,038
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, Nintendo being smart, they said, hey, you know what, we're going to charge $30 for it.

361
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:45,179
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll call it Limited Edition.

362
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:46,400
[SPEAKER_09]: We're actually going to make it Limited.

363
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And now that shit goes on eBay for like $80 because people are dumb.

364
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:56,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at the same token, today I said no to buying that game.

365
00:22:56,455 --> 00:23:00,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I looked at the game and I said, this looks really good, but I'm going to wait for it to end up in the clearance bin.

366
00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:03,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I know, I mean, I said the same thing about the Mario game.

367
00:23:03,656 --> 00:23:04,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, eh, screw it.

368
00:23:05,136 --> 00:23:09,337
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, a lot of other people didn't, and they're all sold out.

369
00:23:09,757 --> 00:23:16,698
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand, yeah, they may have been quite limited, but we're talking limited as in a few hundred thousand copies.

370
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's a lot of money that they made from a ROM.

371
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:27,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of PC games that Chat Comet has me thinking and Steam and Good Deals, I've got to plug this.

372
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:30,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I have to as a fan of this game.

373
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:37,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Civilization 5 is on sale right now and probably by the time the podcasties hear this, the sale will probably be done because I think it was just the weekend.

374
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,486
[SPEAKER_10]: But at least for the live folks, it's like $12.50 right now for Civ 5.

375
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:43,327
[SPEAKER_10]: My favorite Civilization since the original, for real.

376
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:44,768
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

377
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:45,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I played WoW.

378
00:24:13,877 --> 00:24:15,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, what a different week for you.

379
00:24:15,818 --> 00:24:16,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I got Rebecca Black to 80.

380
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:20,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's funny you have a character named Rebecca Black.

381
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:22,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I made it as a total joke.

382
00:24:22,522 --> 00:24:23,783
[SPEAKER_10]: It hasn't had to change your name yet.

383
00:24:24,203 --> 00:24:24,384
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

384
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:26,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm not going to pay to change your name.

385
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,686
[SPEAKER_07]: If they want me to change your name, they're going to give me a free name change.

386
00:24:29,046 --> 00:24:29,707
[SPEAKER_10]: They usually do.

387
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,868
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm going to name her Becca Black.

388
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe Lady Arc Music.

389
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:36,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Friday.

390
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:37,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Friday, that'd be funny.

391
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:42,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to change Fatty Cakes to Ursulol, but I like Fatty Cakes.

392
00:24:43,797 --> 00:24:46,860
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I played some Tiny Tower and Sims.

393
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Sims 3 and the stupid other Sims.

394
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:56,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I just completely rearranged my house while you were here.

395
00:24:56,764 --> 00:24:57,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Sim's social, like...

396
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:28,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Slash's Pop was telling me he tried to find a video that he posted to my wall and he couldn't find it amongst all the bullshit SimSocial posts.

397
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:31,955
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can block the app, but that only goes so far.

398
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:34,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, then when you go to the page, it doesn't show anything.

399
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:38,119
[SPEAKER_10]: You keep having to load because that SimSocial posts so much stuff.

400
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's just...

401
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:47,206
[SPEAKER_10]: I want the game to come out on Google Plus because at least Google Plus kind of exiles that all to one, like the game stuff all has to be on a separate page.

402
00:25:47,806 --> 00:25:51,849
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really want SimSocial on Google Plus, but they probably won't bring it there for that reason.

403
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:58,214
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably how they've got an assload of players is because it's all over Facebook and people are like, the Sims?

404
00:25:58,594 --> 00:25:59,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that game.

405
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:02,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pissed off that my mother hasn't become my neighbor and I'm going to fuss at her.

406
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:03,798
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

407
00:26:04,518 --> 00:26:24,938
[SPEAKER_07]: but um I'm apparently though in the game randomly dating like one of my old friends from the AOL days I am uh I'm actually a dating mistress Tia if you remember her from the show we're we're boyfriend and girlfriend in SimSocial and uh she came over for some woohoo the other day I can't woohoo my girlfriend in game because she doesn't have a double bed but we can play in the bathtub

408
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:27,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow!

409
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:30,656
[SPEAKER_07]: You can click on the bathtub and woohoo in the bathtub.

410
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:34,137
[SPEAKER_10]: It's gonna be one of those weeks here on Orange Slouch Radio.

411
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:35,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I found a mod, by the way, for Sims 3.

412
00:26:35,818 --> 00:26:37,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute, don't you have a spa in your house?

413
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:38,659
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't woohoo in the spa?

414
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:39,319
[SPEAKER_10]: At her house.

415
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me, you can woohoo in the spa.

416
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,220
[SPEAKER_07]: At her house.

417
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:41,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

418
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,600
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

419
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:47,602
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did find there's a patch for Sims 3 where you can change woohoo to fuck.

420
00:26:50,219 --> 00:27:15,222
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're finally breaking the animations where they're doing items with custom animations so everyone look toward Sexy Sims 2 for new mods because I had a ton of them on Sims 2 because I'm a little prevert I also played some Osutatakayo Endon while I was at school because I was bored and I started reading a book but I don't like it so I'm not going to read it anymore

421
00:27:16,522 --> 00:27:17,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to write a review on it.

422
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:20,554
[SPEAKER_07]: So look on Geek Life for the Too Long Didn't Read.

423
00:27:21,852 --> 00:27:22,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

424
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:23,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Plug.

425
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:25,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on to Techmaster Loki.

426
00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:27,255
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your gaming week?

427
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't play a ton of different things.

428
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:32,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly just Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon.

429
00:27:33,378 --> 00:27:39,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm starting to level up my Jet character now, so that's at level 5, I believe.

430
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:45,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, my Tactical's at 8, and just playing a little bit more of that.

431
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:49,646
[SPEAKER_09]: We were trying to play some of the Remix missions on Inferno, and it was just...

432
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:53,128
[SPEAKER_09]: It's as hard as Inferno in the first game, which is really hard.

433
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:55,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Then more Grand Theft Auto stuff.

434
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:03,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been messing around with that and made some new mods that no one's done yet, so I'll have to work on that stuff later on.

435
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:07,438
[SPEAKER_09]: What else did I play?

436
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's pretty much it.

437
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:15,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried that vid rhythm once, and it was just kind of like, eh.

438
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:19,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Which didn't end up being a game, which although the app itself

439
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:20,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

440
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:42,235
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing really rhythm about it.

441
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:44,977
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just vid record clip.

442
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Vid clipping.

443
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:48,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much, yeah.

444
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else in your gaming week?

445
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,321
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

446
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:55,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, Irene, you said you've been very busy at school lately.

447
00:28:56,023 --> 00:28:59,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anything that you have been playing in the past week or so that you want to acknowledge?

448
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:01,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Guild Wars.

449
00:29:02,427 --> 00:29:04,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you've been playing Guild Wars, like old school Guild Wars, huh?

450
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:05,629
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that been going for you?

451
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's been going well.

452
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:13,276
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you do in Guild Wars?

453
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:14,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you keep playing Guild Wars?

454
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:24,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's free and I don't have a lot of time to play, so I won't feel like a stupid bitch if I pay $15 a month for a game that I never play.

455
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:42,258
[SPEAKER_10]: so Guild Wars, Guild Wars I've always kind of called the game at least there's always Guild Wars you know when you have to quit WoW and Final Fantasy XI or whatever your MMO addiction is a choice at least there's always Guild Wars if you've bought it at some point whether it be back when it first came out or one of those ridiculous Steam sales

456
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:43,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

457
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:06,349
[SPEAKER_10]: and people are drawing conclusions from this that Final Fantasy XI is looking to ditch the PlayStation 2 because that's what's holding it back, tech-wise.

458
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:13,494
[SPEAKER_10]: If Final Fantasy XI could ditch the PlayStation 2, they could do all new textures, the game could get an overhaul.

459
00:30:13,894 --> 00:30:20,278
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be very interesting because then Final Fantasy XI could hypothetically look like Final Fantasy XIV but not suck.

460
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:24,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just get rid of Final Fantasy XIV.

461
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:25,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Just pretend it doesn't exist.

462
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:27,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell everybody, hey, you know what?

463
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:29,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you bought Final Fantasy XIV.

464
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,061
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to make it XI.

465
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,181
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll call it 14.

466
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:37,702
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just upgrade 11 to 14.

467
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:47,507
[SPEAKER_10]: 11 other M. Let me go back to Guild Wars for a minute because I've got to say I am really excited looking at the Guild Wars 2 footage even though it doesn't really look like Guild Wars 1 at all.

468
00:30:48,228 --> 00:30:52,530
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know you can kind of start earning stuff for Guild Wars 2 in Guild Wars right now.

469
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you excited about...

470
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:55,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Guild Wars 2 at all?

471
00:31:13,564 --> 00:31:41,254
[SPEAKER_10]: they really try to go out of their way in their developer stuff to really say like it's it's this isn't like other MMOs and we're trying to not approach this like other MMOs we're not trying to emulate other MMOs but my only issue with that is that that's what everybody else has said too and it just ends up being wow but you know what they're able to back up their claims if you look at the gameplay footage if you like look at the screen art all that stuff you know that it's different from wow so it's not just another wow clone is that supposed to be a 2011 release or is that not till next year

472
00:31:41,929 --> 00:32:03,463
[SPEAKER_10]: uh no they haven't even done beta for it oh so it's not going to be out for a while gotcha yeah well good that's one less game i have to buy this year yeah because i i will yeah it looks looks pretty awesome from the stuff i've seen yeah i'm way more interested in that than even like old republic sorry star wars fans but i'm just i guild wars 2 looks awesome yeah i could talk for hours about it but i won't

473
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:04,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but you should.

474
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:05,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you start right now?

475
00:32:07,397 --> 00:32:08,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're just going to cut off my mic.

476
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:09,378
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

477
00:32:10,478 --> 00:32:12,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

478
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:13,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

479
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,381
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

480
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:15,781
[SPEAKER_10]: My gaming week.

481
00:32:16,762 --> 00:32:21,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I finally, after like weeks and weeks, and I know this is old news to a lot of you, but this is what I've been playing.

482
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:22,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I played L.A.

483
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:29,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Noire finally for the first time, which was what I was referring to earlier when I said I was playing a game that felt like playing a movie a little bit.

484
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:30,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, L.A.

485
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Noire.

486
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, I gotta say though, I like it more than I thought I would.

487
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:40,773
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not usually super into these Grand Theft Auto games, and certainly there's components of L.A.

488
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:47,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Noire that kind of feels like, oh, it's Grand Theft Auto in the 40s, but that's really just like the driving around stuff, and a little bit of the combat stuff.

489
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:54,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked the interrogation and the clue finding and all that stuff, even though I am so fucking terrible at interrogations.

490
00:32:54,797 --> 00:32:59,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe how much I bombed what is supposed to be the easiest fucking case in the game.

491
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:01,307
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

492
00:33:23,923 --> 00:33:29,546
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, even in the first case where it's so, like, their expressions are, like, over the top.

493
00:33:29,866 --> 00:33:31,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you can really read them.

494
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:35,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I was, I got every single question wrong my first time.

495
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, multiple times.

496
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:38,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I was trying to figure out what's going on.

497
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Thankfully, the game didn't be all like, you lose, game over.

498
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:46,994
[SPEAKER_10]: It just kind of, I just got yelled at repeatedly by the boss and finally I got through it, figured out the right answers.

499
00:33:47,554 --> 00:33:51,916
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um, I liked the expressions and the faces look really...

500
00:33:53,476 --> 00:33:53,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Neat.

501
00:33:53,956 --> 00:33:55,437
[SPEAKER_10]: And the voice acting's well done, too.

502
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:57,517
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you're laughing over there, Irene.

503
00:33:57,977 --> 00:34:01,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, the, you know, faces looked neat.

504
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:02,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you played it at all?

505
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:05,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not played it, but I watched one of our friends play it.

506
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's a stupid game.

507
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think it's stupid?

508
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:09,781
[SPEAKER_06]: It's corny.

509
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:12,922
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, I mean, like, okay, so you chase after a guy.

510
00:34:13,282 --> 00:34:13,762
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

511
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:14,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun.

512
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you, like, interrogate.

513
00:34:16,243 --> 00:34:16,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just...

514
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:27,452
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels unnatural when you're trying to interrogate them and then if you do it wrong that stupid ass sergeant guy just like is crazy and he yells at you like he's a psycho.

515
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:28,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

516
00:34:28,573 --> 00:34:32,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And that just was the point when I tuned out because I didn't care.

517
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:37,421
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost like being on a game show because like you find out right away if you fucked up or not.

518
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:39,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you hit the button and right away it just fades up.

519
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:40,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Incorrect.

520
00:34:40,323 --> 00:34:41,644
[SPEAKER_10]: And you hear a little doo doo doo.

521
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:44,427
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like god damn it.

522
00:34:45,737 --> 00:34:46,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

523
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,898
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they'll yell at you like the chicks.

524
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:48,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll get out of my store.

525
00:34:48,998 --> 00:34:49,659
[SPEAKER_10]: You're an asshole.

526
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,100
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, but you totally look like you were lying, bitch.

527
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Set your store on fire now.

528
00:34:55,841 --> 00:35:00,763
[SPEAKER_10]: See, that's where the game needed more Grand Theft Auto because like, bitch, I'm going to set the store on fire then.

529
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:06,065
[SPEAKER_10]: But I couldn't do that because you're supposed to be a cop and cops don't set things on fire randomly, you know?

530
00:35:06,265 --> 00:35:06,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

531
00:35:06,825 --> 00:35:08,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Eleanor is not Grand Theft Auto.

532
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:17,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I listened to Dan play the whole thing because I was in here and I was like, wow, this is historically accurate given the dialogue.

533
00:35:18,337 --> 00:35:19,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I saw the ending.

534
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:22,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to spoil, but I was like, what?

535
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,381
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the ending.

536
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:27,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they had to leave it for DLC, I guess.

537
00:35:27,062 --> 00:35:27,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know the ending.

538
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:28,703
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not going to tell you.

539
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:30,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to say, it's what?

540
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:32,145
[SPEAKER_07]: When you see it.

541
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:32,606
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

542
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:33,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

543
00:35:33,513 --> 00:35:33,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll see.

544
00:35:34,053 --> 00:35:34,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

545
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:41,037
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the attention span of a three-year-old, so I don't know if I'll get that far, but I'll probably at least play it a few more times before I return it back to Loki.

546
00:35:42,178 --> 00:35:43,499
[SPEAKER_10]: I've only had it for like two months.

547
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,160
[SPEAKER_10]: What's another month going to hurt?

548
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,262
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny you say that because a three-year-old was watching me play WoW last night, and she would not stop asking me questions.

549
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:50,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

550
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:51,203
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of questions does a three-year-old ask?

551
00:35:51,223 --> 00:35:52,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in Icecrown, too, which was really boring.

552
00:35:53,024 --> 00:35:55,286
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of questions does a three-year-old ask about World of Warcraft?

553
00:35:55,306 --> 00:35:56,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Are those bad guys?

554
00:35:56,386 --> 00:35:57,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they're bad guys.

555
00:35:57,527 --> 00:35:58,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I like bad guys.

556
00:35:58,567 --> 00:35:59,228
[SPEAKER_07]: They're strong.

557
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:04,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, but I have to beat up the bad guys so I'm stronger than they are.

558
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:08,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, you're pretty cool too, but that bad guy's a big bug.

559
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:09,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they eat other bugs?

560
00:36:09,977 --> 00:36:11,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're playing Horde, right?

561
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:11,799
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

562
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,240
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

563
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing Alliance.

564
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:14,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, then never mind.

565
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:20,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, you have to remember, Horde isn't the bad guys.

566
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:22,416
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just an alternative lifestyle.

567
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:25,098
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't know what you'd call it.

568
00:36:25,158 --> 00:36:26,399
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the other faction.

569
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Either you're a goat person or you're a cow person.

570
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:31,442
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just whatever.

571
00:36:31,802 --> 00:36:33,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Space goat, coast to coast.

572
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:34,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

573
00:36:35,345 --> 00:36:36,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Other games I've played this week besides L.A.

574
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:37,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Noire.

575
00:36:37,227 --> 00:36:47,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I revisited the Wii a little bit this week because if you were listening to the show a couple weeks ago, I hacked my Wii and I have a drive now that I'm loading all my games to, which they're my games.

576
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:51,758
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been dumping them to the drive just because I can.

577
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:52,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

578
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:53,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought it would be fun.

579
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,321
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I never have to get up from the couch and...

580
00:36:57,022 --> 00:37:02,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's actually forced me to revisit a lot of old Wii games I haven't played in years.

581
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:03,607
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm actually kind of glad I did it.

582
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:06,509
[SPEAKER_10]: And these are all games I've talked about on the show years and years ago when I first bought them.

583
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,790
[SPEAKER_10]: But I played Geometry Wars for a little while today.

584
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know Geometry Wars had the Wii version, but it's really weird because you have to actually point.

585
00:37:12,953 --> 00:37:14,634
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have two analogs on the Wii, right?

586
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:19,337
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have one analog and then you actually point on the screen for your other analog.

587
00:37:19,818 --> 00:37:22,700
[SPEAKER_10]: And the nice thing about it, I don't know, it's a different way to control it.

588
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,380
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of cool.

589
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,202
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually just point at the ships and it's, I don't know.

590
00:37:26,882 --> 00:37:31,546
[SPEAKER_10]: But I like that the game had all sorts of different maps, all sorts of different types of modes.

591
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:32,427
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fun game.

592
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:36,491
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I was randomly playing New Super Mario Bros.

593
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:36,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii today.

594
00:37:37,432 --> 00:37:37,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

595
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:39,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I could.

596
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:39,834
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was...

597
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:44,013
[SPEAKER_10]: They really just tried to remake Mario 3 with that game, I think.

598
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:47,215
[SPEAKER_10]: As minimal effort as possible.

599
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:48,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not a bad game, though.

600
00:37:49,256 --> 00:37:49,996
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not a bad game.

601
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:52,158
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually one of the better games on the Wii.

602
00:37:52,178 --> 00:37:53,078
[SPEAKER_09]: But see, that's the point.

603
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:56,961
[SPEAKER_09]: The point is you don't have to spend a lot of development money to make a game.

604
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:04,286
[SPEAKER_09]: You could put out something that's very similar to another game, just change up the levels, and then you don't charge as much.

605
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:06,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

606
00:38:09,384 --> 00:38:15,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so, let's see, what else did I play this week besides revisiting the Wii?

607
00:38:15,529 --> 00:38:15,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, 360!

608
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:20,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Since that's up and running again, I played Insane Twisted Shadow Planet.

609
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:24,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I was really into that game, and then the Xbox got hacked, and I was pissed off, so I played a little more of that.

610
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:31,401
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's getting to the point where it's getting a lot harder, but I basically have determined that this is like Metroid, but kind of like more of a puzzler.

611
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:32,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is kind of awesome.

612
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:34,803
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, Insane Twisted Shadow Planet.

613
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:36,144
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you would actually really like it.

614
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:36,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

615
00:38:37,265 --> 00:38:38,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, did you try it, Irene?

616
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:39,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I've tried it.

617
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:40,206
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

618
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:42,848
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one where the robot flies around and he has to use his different app.

619
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:44,148
[SPEAKER_06]: The spaceship.

620
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:44,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

621
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:45,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes, that's it.

622
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:46,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's all right.

623
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?

624
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:47,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

625
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.

626
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,271
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really fun.

627
00:38:49,611 --> 00:38:49,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

628
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:57,735
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'm in the ice world right now, which supposedly the game's only supposed to take like seven or eight hours to beat, but some of it's like really hard.

629
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:04,138
[SPEAKER_10]: The difficulty really amped up really fast from the ocean level to the snow level, I noticed, is kind of interesting.

630
00:39:04,158 --> 00:39:04,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

631
00:39:04,565 --> 00:39:05,346
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'll see you next time.

632
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:22,058
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

633
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:44,344
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

634
00:40:05,642 --> 00:40:23,956
[SPEAKER_10]: uh we will be here back again next week with a show but we will not be here in oh i'm sorry i will not be here in two weeks but i believe they're gonna have a show without me so tune in to hear more on that because i'm going to san francisco and i'm not going to be here in two weeks so i think they're trying to find a guest host or something

635
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:24,881
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go with you.

636
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:26,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I already bought the tickets.

637
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:27,422
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

638
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:29,082
[SPEAKER_10]: You're expensive.

639
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:30,742
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

640
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:33,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to thank you on air, by the way.

641
00:40:34,063 --> 00:40:34,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

642
00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:36,763
[SPEAKER_07]: For my present for kitty sitting.

643
00:40:37,263 --> 00:40:40,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, at the Disneyland show we were gone last time.

644
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:41,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Duffy now.

645
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:43,804
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Duffy purse, but he's cute and he lives on my wall.

646
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:44,665
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

647
00:40:45,305 --> 00:40:45,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Glad you like it.

648
00:40:45,905 --> 00:40:50,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for house-sitting the cats who chewed up the $50 headphones I own while we were gone.

649
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:51,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, someone left them on the floor.

650
00:40:51,886 --> 00:40:52,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't.

651
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:58,131
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you don't think, oh, I gotta make sure that the cord isn't dangling a little bit from my desk.

652
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, if I had known, I would have taken care of it.

653
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:02,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't expect you to know.

654
00:41:03,192 --> 00:41:05,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Please tell me that you've watched that trailer that I just linked you to.

655
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:06,933
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I haven't.

656
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:08,374
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this all about?

657
00:41:08,394 --> 00:41:10,474
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the brand new trailer for Saints Row the Third.

658
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:13,695
[SPEAKER_09]: It's highlighting their third gang called the Deckers.

659
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:16,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh boy, alright, let's check this out before we get into the news.

660
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:18,437
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna like this.

661
00:41:18,657 --> 00:41:19,637
[SPEAKER_09]: You may have to buy it.

662
00:41:20,257 --> 00:41:20,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Saints Row the Third.

663
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:22,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm already thinking I have to buy it.

664
00:41:22,478 --> 00:41:23,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you should.

665
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:25,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I'm looking at trailer.

666
00:41:25,899 --> 00:41:26,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Rate it down.

667
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:26,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

668
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,721
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this makes for great ratings.

669
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:32,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

670
00:41:32,821 --> 00:41:39,163
[SPEAKER_00]: That punk kid is the cyber god who just crashed your helicopter.

671
00:41:42,096 --> 00:41:48,842
[SPEAKER_10]: they are dressed up in Tron like gear like their jackets are all glowing blue keep watching alright

672
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:09,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, keep watching.

673
00:42:09,763 --> 00:42:11,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, they're all racing on cars.

674
00:42:12,244 --> 00:42:12,464
Oh no.

675
00:42:12,484 --> 00:42:12,744
Oh yes.

676
00:42:12,784 --> 00:42:15,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh please tell me they're gonna get on light pipes and shit.

677
00:42:15,465 --> 00:42:20,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, they're not even like trying to hide the fact what inspires this, are they?

678
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:48,841
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait to play this fucking game.

679
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:52,604
[SPEAKER_06]: How is this at all like the other two games?

680
00:42:53,965 --> 00:42:56,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just confused.

681
00:42:56,167 --> 00:43:00,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Because with Saints Row, they've decided to just say, you know what?

682
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:01,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck it.

683
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:03,734
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not even going to just try to be a real game anymore.

684
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:05,576
[SPEAKER_10]: This is all about excess.

685
00:43:06,036 --> 00:43:07,337
[SPEAKER_10]: This game is just excessive.

686
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,159
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unnecessary and excessive.

687
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:14,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Each trailer, they go more over the top than the last one.

688
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:20,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how you're going to get more over the top than going into a virtual world and fighting stuff Tron style.

689
00:43:22,087 --> 00:43:22,947
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

690
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:25,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I want now.

691
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:55,619
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw in our chatroom also points out the fact that they're called the Deckards is a reference to Blade Runner so it's not just Tron that's inspiring this although visually it's certainly very very Tron-esque so yeah Harrison Ford was Deckard so anyhow here's the thing I'm almost sold on Saints Row 3 but it's also one of those you know what I don't want to buy into trailers just I'm gonna wait for the game to come out see the reviews see Loki's review very important I know he thinks he's gonna love it but

692
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:19,051
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta hear, look, dude, dude, what, I was listening to Bobby's show before we were live tonight, right, as I usually do on The Car Ride Over, and Madden came out this past week, which is usually, like, a huge release, apparently Madden has, I mean, I don't really play the Madden games, but I know they're huge, and everybody buys them, and they're very important, very, very high profile games, probably only second to, like, a Call of Duty game

693
00:44:20,672 --> 00:44:35,345
[SPEAKER_10]: and apparently the menus fucking freeze and shit like just basic shit is broken in Madden it sounds like from what I'm hearing it's like there's literally nothing that this game could do to make me not want to buy it I mean there's nothing

694
00:44:36,332 --> 00:44:41,135
[SPEAKER_09]: absolutely nothing and come out and say the next gang is My Little Ponies and I wouldn't fucking care.

695
00:44:41,575 --> 00:44:44,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Although that would probably make me want to buy the game even more because it's so ridiculous.

696
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:47,098
[SPEAKER_06]: What if you have to play Raiden for the rest of the game?

697
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:50,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like play it still?

698
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:51,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

699
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:52,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

700
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:54,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even understand.

701
00:44:54,843 --> 00:44:55,063
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

702
00:44:55,803 --> 00:44:57,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that his name from Metal Gear Solid 2?

703
00:44:58,725 --> 00:44:59,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

704
00:44:59,566 --> 00:44:59,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

705
00:44:59,886 --> 00:45:00,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that his name?

706
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:01,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Raiden?

707
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:02,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

708
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:03,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

709
00:45:03,948 --> 00:45:04,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

710
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:05,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Womp, womp, womp.

711
00:45:08,297 --> 00:45:34,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Blackwolf is in chat actually and points out deckers are also the term in Shadowrun for the grid hackers so lots of references that is very true I've played one yes I did play Shadowrun alright well thank you for derailing the show with that trailer it's actually very interesting looking alright let's actually get into the news we were planning on discussing tonight 45 minutes into the show and we'll start off with almost an immediate follow up to something last week that came up at the end of the show right Loki?

712
00:45:34,727 --> 00:45:35,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon Quest X

713
00:45:43,147 --> 00:45:45,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Or at least they're going to make an announcement about Dragon Quest.

714
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,792
[SPEAKER_09]: That announcement was Dragon Quest X Online.

715
00:45:49,252 --> 00:45:50,593
[SPEAKER_09]: It is an online RPG.

716
00:45:51,354 --> 00:45:57,199
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is going to be... I'm not sure if it's still being... It looks like it's still being developed by Level 5.

717
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, they're responsible for Dragon Quest VIII and IX.

718
00:46:02,744 --> 00:46:04,326
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is coming out on the Wii.

719
00:46:04,646 --> 00:46:07,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I guess it's being developed for the Wii U as well.

720
00:46:08,169 --> 00:46:08,329
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

721
00:46:11,195 --> 00:46:17,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they're saying also they're considering the 3DS as some form of character transfers or something like that.

722
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:27,906
[SPEAKER_09]: It does of course require an internet connection being that it's an online MMO and it's going to require a fee as well.

723
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's going to be some sort of usage fee for that.

724
00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:35,631
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of interesting because there's really no MMOs on the Wii and

725
00:46:37,813 --> 00:46:41,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering the Wii's pretty much at the end of its life cycle already, that's kind of weird.

726
00:46:42,357 --> 00:46:49,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I gotta admit, we were talking about this briefly on the show last week because the press conference was about to start when we ended the show last week.

727
00:46:50,144 --> 00:47:01,113
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I drive home, I get home, I go into the house, and I fire up my reader to look at what news I missed while the show was going on, and there's an announcement about Dragon Quest X, and I'm like, oh, Dragon Quest X is gonna be online?

728
00:47:01,673 --> 00:47:02,214
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Wii?

729
00:47:02,534 --> 00:47:03,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

730
00:47:03,775 --> 00:47:08,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Online, Wii, syntax error, I don't understand, how does this compute?

731
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,141
[SPEAKER_10]: You just divided by zero.

732
00:47:11,022 --> 00:47:17,888
[SPEAKER_09]: The Monster Hunter game over there was, I believe, had paid online as well.

733
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:25,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking, though, that this is mainly just going to be a Wii U game, but that they're like, well, you know what, we're going to make it.

734
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:27,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Since we promised it on the Wii.

735
00:47:28,034 --> 00:47:32,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's make a version also for the Wii because, you know, we still have a user base for that.

736
00:47:32,956 --> 00:47:34,257
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a Zelda-esque type of thing.

737
00:47:34,277 --> 00:47:41,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Because remember, Zelda Twilight Princess was a launch title, but they had to make the GameCube version because they had originally announced it for GameCube, and it was kind of the same hardware.

738
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:42,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, really, more like...

739
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:48,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it was ready for the GameCube, but they delayed it so they could put it as a Wii launch title.

740
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:50,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly what they're doing here with Dragon Quest X.

741
00:47:52,156 --> 00:47:52,596
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Momomish

742
00:48:16,431 --> 00:48:18,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's Momo-ish, but it's not... Yeah, I guess.

743
00:48:18,893 --> 00:48:21,915
[SPEAKER_09]: So they would probably have an offline component as well.

744
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:31,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's going to be online only, but when I hear usage fees and requires the internet, that screams MMO to me.

745
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:42,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Guru in our chatroom says, from the makers of Final Fantasy XIV, from the publishers of Final Fantasy XIV, it is a different studio putting this together, right?

746
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:46,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Level 5 had nothing to do with Final Fantasy XIV or any Final Fantasy game for that matter that I can think of.

747
00:48:47,412 --> 00:48:49,254
[SPEAKER_10]: So, no, these are different teams.

748
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:50,014
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important to say.

749
00:48:50,415 --> 00:48:54,999
[SPEAKER_10]: I get your joke, but hopefully the MMO experience doesn't completely suck.

750
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:06,221
[SPEAKER_10]: or whatever online adventuring experience they come up with, which I'm convinced is going to be more like White Knight Chronicles, which was kind of... That game's really kind of a cult kind of game.

751
00:49:06,281 --> 00:49:10,682
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't really break through, but there's definitely a player base playing that game.

752
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:16,163
[SPEAKER_09]: But once again, this also begs one simple question.

753
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:19,464
[SPEAKER_09]: This game is definitely niche.

754
00:49:19,904 --> 00:49:20,164
[SPEAKER_09]: It is...

755
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:22,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very niche.

756
00:49:22,325 --> 00:49:24,546
[SPEAKER_09]: You're talking about an online game.

757
00:49:24,706 --> 00:49:26,527
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, an online MMO on the Wii.

758
00:49:27,228 --> 00:49:28,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot of people are going to bite on that.

759
00:49:28,909 --> 00:49:30,770
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's an RPG.

760
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:34,352
[SPEAKER_09]: A Japanese-style RPG on the Wii.

761
00:49:34,392 --> 00:49:38,755
[SPEAKER_09]: That's talk about narrowing the user base down quite a bit.

762
00:49:39,735 --> 00:49:45,859
[SPEAKER_09]: And yet, no Last Story or Xenoblade or anything like that over here.

763
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,160
[SPEAKER_09]: But yet, they're going to bring that out.

764
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:48,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

765
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:53,626
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR Dollar Bill in the chatroom says, explain how you guys define MMORPG.

766
00:49:54,066 --> 00:50:00,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, I mean, obviously it's a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, right?

767
00:50:00,473 --> 00:50:03,977
[SPEAKER_10]: But the reason why Phantasy Star Universe kind of doesn't fall out of that category...

768
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:06,880
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

769
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Where you can interact with people and then you have the game.

770
00:50:26,674 --> 00:50:29,215
[SPEAKER_10]: You form your parties in the lobby and then you really go play the game.

771
00:50:29,515 --> 00:50:30,855
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have chat.

772
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:31,875
[SPEAKER_07]: You have voice chat.

773
00:50:32,356 --> 00:50:33,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was a big component.

774
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:34,596
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's nothing else.

775
00:50:34,696 --> 00:50:38,878
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no game component really in those lobbies outside of shops.

776
00:50:39,278 --> 00:50:40,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And playing hockey.

777
00:50:40,298 --> 00:50:41,758
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no PvP.

778
00:50:42,258 --> 00:50:43,499
[SPEAKER_10]: And playing hockey.

779
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:44,499
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

780
00:50:45,219 --> 00:50:47,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And the giant choo-choo rocket level.

781
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,280
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

782
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:54,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think that it better be an MMO because what am I paying for online then for?

783
00:50:55,024 --> 00:50:57,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the Wii, it's online and it's free.

784
00:50:57,205 --> 00:51:01,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would I have to pay to play a game I just bought online?

785
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:02,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Because MMOs you pay to play.

786
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:08,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, MMOs you pay to play, but if it's not an MMO, if we're just talking about a game with some four-player, 16-player online...

787
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:11,953
[SPEAKER_10]: White Knight Chronicles White Knight Chronicles

788
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:30,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

789
00:51:49,699 --> 00:51:50,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

790
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:15,445
[SPEAKER_09]: and then you totally ignored your hardcore gamer user base in the process.

791
00:52:15,905 --> 00:52:19,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's going to work out really well for you for this next console as well.

792
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,563
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just... I don't think it's going to do very well.

793
00:52:24,863 --> 00:52:28,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just look at all the other niche hardcore games that have been out there.

794
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:32,368
[SPEAKER_09]: RPGs and non-RPGs.

795
00:52:32,768 --> 00:52:33,809
[SPEAKER_09]: They just haven't done well.

796
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:38,052
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand this is going to be published probably by... I don't know if it's Square Enix.

797
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:44,015
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm guessing Nintendo because they did the last Dragon Quest game and Dragon Quest Monsters 2 and stuff like that.

798
00:52:45,717 --> 00:52:49,359
[SPEAKER_09]: So if it's published by Nintendo, I mean, there'll be some more marketing behind that, but...

799
00:52:51,224 --> 00:52:52,784
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna be tough.

800
00:52:52,884 --> 00:52:54,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially convincing people.

801
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:58,185
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, I don't know.

802
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:58,865
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be tough.

803
00:52:59,005 --> 00:53:02,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I just need to really see more of the game before I can really make a call.

804
00:53:02,406 --> 00:53:07,267
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta play the game, see some reviews, see some trailers that aren't just cutscenes.

805
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:08,287
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not.

806
00:53:08,427 --> 00:53:10,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I just... Like, I love Dragon Quest VIII.

807
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:13,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, that game was so fucking good on the PlayStation.

808
00:53:13,268 --> 00:53:15,709
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I just... We'll see.

809
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:17,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if it's worth paying...

810
00:53:18,109 --> 00:53:22,651
[SPEAKER_10]: but it sounds like there's going to be still at least a full single player game and that part I kind of like at least.

811
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:24,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Phantasy Star Universe is the same way.

812
00:53:24,272 --> 00:53:41,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if it's got that then that's fine and it's worth a purchase because then you don't have to play the online portion of it and if they're going to go the whole Phantasy Star online route then that's fine but it's just if they're going just an MMO route that's going to be a difficult sell.

813
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,262
[SPEAKER_09]: 3DS Circle Pad Attachment

814
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:10,848
[SPEAKER_10]: The 3DS will plug into this kind of, it looks like a docking bay sort of thing that has, yes, another analog stick on the right-hand side.

815
00:54:11,588 --> 00:54:22,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Along with this announcement came an announcement that they are making Monster Hunter Tri-G on the 3DS, which, you know, requires a second analog controller just the way the game is.

816
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:28,403
[SPEAKER_10]: So now what's kind of confusing is, did they do this circle attachment just to get the Monster Hunter game,

817
00:54:28,903 --> 00:54:30,003
[SPEAKER_10]: or is this the future of the 3DS

818
00:54:58,972 --> 00:55:21,370
[SPEAKER_09]: If I have to... I mean, I don't know if I would play a Monster Hunter game, but if this ends up being the norm, which I worry it could be... They're obviously... I mean, if Nintendo's making a peripheral for this game, and I know Monster Hunter's gonna be big in Japan, if it even comes out over here, if they're making a peripheral for this, you better damn well believe that's gonna be used for something other than just one game.

819
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, why even bother if it's gonna be for just one game?

820
00:55:25,593 --> 00:55:27,214
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, as you said...

821
00:55:28,135 --> 00:55:31,116
[SPEAKER_09]: The cost thing, you didn't give me free games because you dropped the price of the system.

822
00:55:31,156 --> 00:55:31,556
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

823
00:55:31,596 --> 00:55:32,377
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't have to do that.

824
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:35,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I understand the price is going to drop.

825
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:36,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was a little bit sooner than I had thought.

826
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:37,619
[SPEAKER_09]: But whatever.

827
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:37,999
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

828
00:55:38,019 --> 00:55:39,639
[SPEAKER_09]: That's too well.

829
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:40,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

830
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,600
[SPEAKER_09]: So I bought the system back in March.

831
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I had it a few months with no games.

832
00:55:45,221 --> 00:55:49,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And I dropped it, and they gave me some free virtual console games, which I've not played.

833
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:51,764
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's fine.

834
00:55:51,924 --> 00:55:55,025
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is going to split your user base in half now.

835
00:55:55,405 --> 00:56:14,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is great, because now everyone thinks that the system is going to be redesigned, whether it is or not, and all the people that are thinking about, hey, I really need to pick up a 3DS this holiday to pick up some Mario and Mario Kart games and stuff like that, and whatever else they have coming for the 3DS, people are going to wait.

836
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:20,120
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be interesting to see what Nintendo says to this press conference because I'm looking at our chatroom, of course, is lighting up on this story.

837
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to join us live.

838
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:27,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Zether in chat says, as of now, that add-on is only for Monster Hunter Tri-G.

839
00:56:28,162 --> 00:56:35,204
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm kind of going, okay, yeah, as of now, but there's certainly that skeptic in me that's saying, but now that that's out there, who else might use it?

840
00:56:35,524 --> 00:56:39,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Now granted, just because the peripheral exists doesn't mean everybody's going to use it.

841
00:56:39,705 --> 00:56:44,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I think of, okay, that Metroid pinball game had that rumble pack in the DS.

842
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:45,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that thing?

843
00:56:45,307 --> 00:56:46,767
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a real flash in the pan, right?

844
00:56:47,288 --> 00:56:49,188
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think any other games really used it.

845
00:56:49,328 --> 00:56:50,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's a bunch of games that used it.

846
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:51,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Were there?

847
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:51,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

848
00:56:52,029 --> 00:56:53,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh, I always thought there were like one or two.

849
00:56:53,731 --> 00:56:59,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a lot, but see that thing right there though, that's not necessary to play the game.

850
00:56:59,438 --> 00:57:01,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Rumble, eh, whatever, so my system doesn't rumble.

851
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:03,102
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a big deal.

852
00:57:03,603 --> 00:57:04,964
[SPEAKER_09]: None of them do nowadays anyways.

853
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:07,868
[SPEAKER_09]: But a second analog stick is kind of important.

854
00:57:07,908 --> 00:57:09,149
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like saying, oh, you know,

855
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:25,275
[SPEAKER_09]: we added some buttons in fact that does add a couple shoulder buttons to the thing as well and a trigger I think so that's a big deal because now you have dual analogs so you can do first person shooters on that system quite well now

856
00:57:25,815 --> 00:57:26,936
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

857
00:57:53,252 --> 00:58:02,100
[SPEAKER_10]: and could it be all this call about, gee, what do you mean the system's only going to come with one Wii U controller and we're not going to buy a second controller separately?

858
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Could this be the path we're going down?

859
00:58:04,662 --> 00:58:04,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

860
00:58:06,523 --> 00:58:07,624
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly what they're doing.

861
00:58:07,644 --> 00:58:21,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know when that controller first came out, listen to the episodes of OLR leading up to the reveal of the Wii U because it's very interesting because we were theorizing and theorizing and then all of a sudden it just kind of dawned on us that like,

862
00:58:21,716 --> 00:58:28,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Duh, everything we have heard about this was clearly just the Wii U controller is a freaking DS without the top screen.

863
00:58:28,648 --> 00:58:29,870
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the Wii U controller is.

864
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:30,971
[SPEAKER_10]: And a few more buttons.

865
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:33,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's your few more buttons now.

866
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:35,599
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very interesting.

867
00:58:37,082 --> 00:58:41,804
[SPEAKER_10]: This Nintendo conference that's coming up tomorrow is going to be very interesting.

868
00:58:43,684 --> 00:58:46,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I just can't wait to hear their rationalization.

869
00:58:47,886 --> 00:58:58,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see if they only announce the Monster Hunter thing for this or if they say a new Pokemon game and the Pokemon game is going to use two analog sticks too because then it's over.

870
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:59,350
[SPEAKER_10]: All the games are using it.

871
00:59:00,414 --> 00:59:01,476
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just one game.

872
00:59:20,695 --> 00:59:25,200
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, you should have fucking thought of this when you're designing your system.

873
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:26,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I don't know.

874
00:59:26,141 --> 00:59:26,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

875
00:59:27,002 --> 00:59:28,204
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the PSP.

876
00:59:28,544 --> 00:59:30,626
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the number one bitch about the PSP?

877
00:59:30,806 --> 00:59:32,869
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have a fucking second analog stick.

878
00:59:33,349 --> 00:59:33,830
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd you think?

879
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:34,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you know what?

880
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:37,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe people want a second analog stick.

881
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:43,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh, could that be possibly what people want since they're saying I want a second analog stick?

882
00:59:43,518 --> 00:59:45,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Nah, that's not what they want.

883
00:59:45,139 --> 00:59:46,620
[SPEAKER_09]: They just want one analog stick.

884
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,380
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're going to do.

885
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,642
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to leave them with just one analog stick.

886
00:59:50,443 --> 00:59:51,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, damn.

887
00:59:51,403 --> 00:59:54,305
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a big game comes out that needs a second analog stick.

888
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:55,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, crap.

889
00:59:55,686 --> 00:59:58,148
[SPEAKER_09]: We better make another adjustment to this.

890
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:02,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'd be pissed even if it is an accessory or whatever.

891
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:07,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only does it make it, you know, how the fuck am I supposed to carry that around with me now?

892
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:09,556
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to fucking fit in my pocket.

893
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:21,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, again, we have to really wait until after Nintendo makes the official announcement because I think it's still, I mean, even though we have the picture and everything, it's still too early to say what the point of this is.

894
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:25,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this a Monster Hunter add-on or is this, we don't know.

895
01:00:26,131 --> 01:00:30,495
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're all looking at it going, gosh, it makes your 3DS look like a Wii U controller.

896
01:00:31,476 --> 01:00:33,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, a lot of people want to have that second analog stick.

897
01:00:34,758 --> 01:00:37,400
[SPEAKER_10]: We've heard rumors about a 3DS redesign anyway.

898
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,381
[SPEAKER_10]: It would all add up.

899
01:00:39,421 --> 01:00:40,562
[SPEAKER_10]: This is probably happening.

900
01:00:40,662 --> 01:00:48,847
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of akin this to – and I see some folks in chat are talking about, well, not every peripheral goes on forever, like the e-reader, printer, and so forth.

901
01:00:48,867 --> 01:00:51,448
[SPEAKER_10]: But I go – and none of these are ever required.

902
01:00:51,468 --> 01:00:54,410
[SPEAKER_10]: But then I go, but what about the Wii Plus motion thing?

903
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:55,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii Motion Plus.

904
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:59,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii Motion Plus didn't come out until later and now it's like if you want to play the new Zelda game you have to have it.

905
01:01:00,371 --> 01:01:04,032
[SPEAKER_10]: It would not be unheard of for Nintendo to require this in the future.

906
01:01:04,052 --> 01:01:07,673
[SPEAKER_09]: This is more along the lines of Wii Motion Plus than it is the e-reader.

907
01:01:08,313 --> 01:01:11,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are all gimmicky things that weren't necessary like the Rumble Pack.

908
01:01:12,054 --> 01:01:14,735
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not necessary to play a DS game.

909
01:01:14,835 --> 01:01:15,735
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just a gimmicky thing.

910
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,916
[SPEAKER_10]: The e-reader was actually a really kind of cool idea.

911
01:01:17,956 --> 01:01:20,956
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a cool idea but it was still a gimmick.

912
01:01:20,996 --> 01:01:22,677
[SPEAKER_09]: You could have done something else to...

913
01:01:23,837 --> 01:01:27,718
[SPEAKER_10]: How awesome was it to have an old school NES game on five cards in your pocket?

914
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:29,239
[SPEAKER_10]: That was kind of cool, I'm sorry.

915
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:35,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's pretty cool, but at the same time, though, this is another analog stick.

916
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,461
[SPEAKER_09]: This is adding another joystick.

917
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:40,201
[SPEAKER_09]: This is very significant.

918
01:01:41,662 --> 01:01:43,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a few extra buttons on there.

919
01:01:43,602 --> 01:01:46,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, is kind of interesting now that I think of it.

920
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:50,804
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably going to use that IR port that's on the back of that fucking 3DS.

921
01:01:50,984 --> 01:01:52,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's like, what the hell is this IR port for?

922
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:54,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

923
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,224
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's just... Alright.

924
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:02,107
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got more stories to talk about.

925
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:05,250
[SPEAKER_09]: The 3DS and... Let me bring some of these up real quick.

926
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:08,833
[SPEAKER_10]: 3DS, obviously the price cut happened and a lot of you are very happy about it.

927
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:10,074
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of you are happy about it?

928
01:02:10,795 --> 01:02:13,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Over 260% are buying this now than were before 3DS.

929
01:02:15,479 --> 01:02:21,760
[SPEAKER_10]: 3DS sold 185,000 units between the price cut and the month's end.

930
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:25,841
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a 260% increase over that same time period in July.

931
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:32,442
[SPEAKER_10]: So it does mean that this has motivated sales a little more, and this is a trend that's going to continue through Christmas, guaranteed.

932
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:38,904
[SPEAKER_10]: I still think, especially now that the Vita's not around this Christmas, this thing's going to sell like crazy over the holidays.

933
01:02:40,244 --> 01:02:47,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Despite all this other crap we're talking about, soccer moms don't know about... Soccer moms are not reading Famitsu magazine in Japan.

934
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:52,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly think that the whole thing with the 3DS was really very carefully planned.

935
01:02:53,434 --> 01:02:59,298
[SPEAKER_07]: They knew they didn't have a good thing out quite yet, but at least at the higher price anyway with the intention of dropping the price.

936
01:02:59,638 --> 01:03:00,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they knew it would...

937
01:03:02,304 --> 01:03:04,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sales would happen after a price drop.

938
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:05,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

939
01:03:05,687 --> 01:03:12,072
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of actually disagree because I think Nintendo saw the reception at E3 and was like, holy shit, we've struck gold with this thing.

940
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,213
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to get it out now.

941
01:03:13,534 --> 01:03:15,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And they put it out in some ways too soon.

942
01:03:16,136 --> 01:03:20,840
[SPEAKER_10]: But where I will hear is that I think the strategy all along was a build-up to Christmas.

943
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:26,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they released it at the end of the fiscal year to pad the low sales of Wii and then it's going to just...

944
01:03:27,225 --> 01:03:30,747
[SPEAKER_10]: The price drop, on the other hand, I don't think that was planned.

945
01:03:30,927 --> 01:03:34,928
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because if they were planning on doing it, well, no one plans on dropping the price of that.

946
01:03:35,028 --> 01:03:37,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they've got to be selling it at a loss now.

947
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:46,193
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they weren't selling it at a loss and they had that much of a margin in there, they could have fit a second fucking analog stick in there.

948
01:03:46,213 --> 01:03:49,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, an analog stick doesn't cost hardly anything.

949
01:03:49,194 --> 01:03:52,076
[SPEAKER_09]: It's maybe $10 to put in that system.

950
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:53,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I doubt it's even $10.

951
01:03:54,823 --> 01:03:56,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I've bought replacements for my PSP.

952
01:03:56,746 --> 01:03:59,329
[SPEAKER_07]: The 3DS production cost is $101 per unit.

953
01:03:59,590 --> 01:03:59,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

954
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:00,251
[SPEAKER_07]: So, including overhead...

955
01:04:07,305 --> 01:04:08,586
[SPEAKER_07]: They're probably still pulling a profit on it.

956
01:04:08,726 --> 01:04:13,608
[SPEAKER_09]: So they could have charged 10 extra dollars in what they're charging now and added a second analog stick all along.

957
01:04:13,908 --> 01:04:14,528
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

958
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:16,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, guess what, Nintendo?

959
01:04:16,369 --> 01:04:20,291
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good thing to have things on your system, like say a second analog stick.

960
01:04:20,711 --> 01:04:21,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know what?

961
01:04:21,492 --> 01:04:26,674
[SPEAKER_09]: You may not have a use for it right now, but publishers would probably want that.

962
01:04:27,554 --> 01:04:29,515
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes development of games a little bit easier.

963
01:04:29,675 --> 01:04:33,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of having to do some funky right analog stick using the touchscreen.

964
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:34,012
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

965
01:04:57,711 --> 01:04:58,432
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's not dead.

966
01:04:59,112 --> 01:04:59,913
[SPEAKER_10]: It's far from it.

967
01:05:00,033 --> 01:05:05,696
[SPEAKER_10]: They've just announced that on September 18th there will be a metallic rose DSiX.

968
01:05:05,756 --> 01:05:06,517
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fucking pink.

969
01:05:06,797 --> 01:05:10,520
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fucking pink DSi and it's coming out on September 18th.

970
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want it.

971
01:05:12,301 --> 01:05:16,704
[SPEAKER_07]: In the same way that I wanted my pink Advance that I have the Afterburner in.

972
01:05:17,484 --> 01:05:18,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want this now.

973
01:05:18,405 --> 01:05:19,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know, whatever.

974
01:05:19,606 --> 01:05:21,427
[SPEAKER_10]: The DSiX, you know, the screens are really big.

975
01:05:21,467 --> 01:05:22,448
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of nice, whatever.

976
01:05:22,488 --> 01:05:25,350
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is weird that it's the same price as the 3DS.

977
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:27,131
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a little weird to me.

978
01:05:28,212 --> 01:05:29,953
[SPEAKER_10]: DS Lights, by the way, are still on shelves.

979
01:05:29,973 --> 01:05:31,114
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a really pretty blue one.

980
01:05:32,575 --> 01:05:33,796
[SPEAKER_10]: 99 bucks for DS Light.

981
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:36,899
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting to me.

982
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:39,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

983
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:40,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

984
01:05:40,883 --> 01:05:41,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get empty.

985
01:05:42,404 --> 01:05:42,704
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

986
01:05:42,904 --> 01:05:46,548
[SPEAKER_09]: These people that buy these, you know, this pink system that's coming out, same price as the 3DS...

987
01:05:48,482 --> 01:05:50,505
[SPEAKER_09]: You deserve all those high-priced games and shit.

988
01:05:50,585 --> 01:05:58,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, we're gonna revisit all of this again next week because the Nintendo press conference is happening in a couple days and who knows what curveballs are gonna come out of that.

989
01:05:58,817 --> 01:06:02,101
[SPEAKER_10]: There could be that... I mean, if a Pokemon game is announced...

990
01:06:03,018 --> 01:06:04,939
[SPEAKER_10]: They already have a Pokemon game.

991
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:06,340
[SPEAKER_10]: What Pokemon game?

992
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Not 3D.

993
01:06:08,702 --> 01:06:09,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

994
01:06:09,162 --> 01:06:13,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they have a Pokemon, but it's like Pokemon Snap.

995
01:06:13,945 --> 01:06:16,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Pokemon Snap is not really a Pokemon game.

996
01:06:16,086 --> 01:06:17,407
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

997
01:06:17,467 --> 01:06:19,348
[SPEAKER_10]: They need a Pokemon Magenta.

998
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:23,451
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no Pokemon game that's going to need a second analog stick.

999
01:06:26,252 --> 01:06:27,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you just haven't thought of it yet.

1000
01:06:27,653 --> 01:06:28,914
[SPEAKER_09]: A Pokemon first-person shooter.

1001
01:06:29,074 --> 01:06:30,775
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be all sorts of lame.

1002
01:06:31,416 --> 01:06:32,297
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that would be awesome.

1003
01:06:32,437 --> 01:06:32,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you kidding?

1004
01:06:32,877 --> 01:06:33,998
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it would be stupid.

1005
01:06:35,956 --> 01:06:37,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon First Person Shooter.

1006
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:40,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that pretty much Pokemon Snap?

1007
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:41,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.

1008
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:44,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're shooting from a first person perspective.

1009
01:06:44,902 --> 01:06:45,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, get out.

1010
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:46,103
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1011
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:47,283
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I agree.

1012
01:06:47,463 --> 01:06:48,564
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a first person shooter.

1013
01:06:48,944 --> 01:06:54,668
[SPEAKER_07]: You just shot photos of them and not, you know, shooting them dead with bullets into their, you know, cute little fuzzy heads.

1014
01:06:55,388 --> 01:06:58,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying Goldeneye would have been that much better if it was Pikachu killing people.

1015
01:06:59,131 --> 01:06:59,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying.

1016
01:07:02,293 --> 01:07:04,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let's move on.

1017
01:07:04,835 --> 01:07:05,435
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

1018
01:07:05,899 --> 01:07:06,740
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Crytek?

1019
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:08,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Fail!

1020
01:07:10,223 --> 01:07:17,411
[SPEAKER_07]: One of their, I guess, former employees decided that they were going to go off on Tumblr.

1021
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:23,296
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an anonymous account, which I took the liberty of reblogging everything on our Tumblr.

1022
01:07:23,697 --> 01:07:24,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Hint, hint, hint.

1023
01:07:24,358 --> 01:07:26,159
[SPEAKER_07]: OrangeLoungeRadio.tumblr.com

1024
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:36,130
[SPEAKER_07]: and basically is listing this whole just crazy line of stuff that they've done that's illegal.

1025
01:07:37,411 --> 01:07:40,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Going over this, he said, I'm going to read a little bit.

1026
01:07:40,855 --> 01:07:49,163
[SPEAKER_07]: From the outside, Crytek produces some of the most graphically pleasing games around, those being Far Cry, Crysis, Crysis, Warhead, and Crysis 2, 4 games in 10 years.

1027
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:55,208
[SPEAKER_07]: The work of the individual responsible, the individual should be proud of what they've done.

1028
01:07:55,908 --> 01:08:08,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But they basically said that there's a bullying mentality given at the CEO levels where they're delivered lines like, you should be proud to work for Crytek yet demanding six months of crunch time due to project management failures.

1029
01:08:09,077 --> 01:08:12,820
[SPEAKER_07]: This caused certain members of staff to suffer both in medical and personal ways.

1030
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:31,433
[SPEAKER_07]: and he's listing, alright, the splitted the work atmosphere that resulted in the resignation and or unlawful firing of global talent manager, global head of resourceful humans, lead game designer, lead community manager, community manager, lead researcher, storyboard and concept artist and a whole list of developers and designers.

1031
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:50,200
[SPEAKER_07]: and so basically the article you know he's just there on Tumblr pretty much blasting them I mean nothing really specifically listed just said that a lot of senior staff was made redundant and that employees were quote allowed to work longer hours and weekend days

1032
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,061
[SPEAKER_07]: which, again, Crytek's a German developer in violation of German law.

1033
01:08:56,062 --> 01:09:11,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the co-founder, Avni Yerli, said, and he spoke with Develop about these practices and said that they were misleading accusations and, quote, is very distressing for us to think that an individual thinks we've been treating them unfairly.

1034
01:09:11,287 --> 01:09:12,288
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very disappointing.

1035
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:15,429
[SPEAKER_07]: So I actually found a rebuttal on the same Tumblr.

1036
01:09:17,632 --> 01:09:44,253
[SPEAKER_07]: and he goes on saying as previously mentioned we do not aim to mislead or give erroneous opinions as this would ultimately decrease the strength on which the blog was first created and it is nothing but bring into doubt the levels of truth featured within so he said if German labor codes were being met and strictly adhered to there would be no need for the successful court cases against Crytek GmbH in which a company lawyer was present

1037
01:09:45,094 --> 01:09:50,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Crytek, if you can provide proof that no one has ever successfully claimed compensation due to an illegal firing, then please do so.

1038
01:09:51,218 --> 01:09:51,658
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot.

1039
01:09:53,179 --> 01:09:54,500
[SPEAKER_07]: And so basically just going on.

1040
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,501
[SPEAKER_07]: You can read this all if you want to.

1041
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:57,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I've linked them both on our Tumblr.

1042
01:09:58,382 --> 01:10:01,744
[SPEAKER_07]: But it really goes long.

1043
01:10:01,824 --> 01:10:04,906
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's talking just... This is clearly somebody who was there.

1044
01:10:06,727 --> 01:10:11,490
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of those cases where I think you go, okay, you read this and you go, well...

1045
01:10:12,059 --> 01:10:14,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Another person complaining about the development industry.

1046
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,221
[SPEAKER_10]: What a shock.

1047
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:16,461
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably true.

1048
01:10:17,022 --> 01:10:22,124
[SPEAKER_10]: But then you look at it and you go, well, he probably does have a lot of bitterness issues.

1049
01:10:22,224 --> 01:10:23,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously something happened there.

1050
01:10:23,645 --> 01:10:25,006
[SPEAKER_07]: None of this reads like anyone bitter.

1051
01:10:25,206 --> 01:10:28,448
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I still think the answer's probably in the middle somewhere.

1052
01:10:28,988 --> 01:10:33,350
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably, you know, and I think I just said this two weeks ago on the show on a very similar story.

1053
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:38,893
[SPEAKER_10]: There's your side of the story, my side of the story, and the truth somewhere in the middle.

1054
01:10:39,173 --> 01:10:40,534
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably what's happening here too.

1055
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's another line on here, though, that I think is a very good point.

1056
01:10:44,923 --> 01:10:47,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Enforcing weekend work and expecting them to come in are two different things.

1057
01:10:48,445 --> 01:10:54,930
[SPEAKER_07]: As an employee, you know that if you aren't showing the drive and ambition to become a team player, your direct line manager may take a negative stance on your progression in the company.

1058
01:10:55,510 --> 01:11:05,878
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, it's talking about the impact it has on home life, on employee well-being, which is actually something that I think is a big problem here in the U.S., to be perfectly honest.

1059
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:06,919
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

1060
01:11:09,022 --> 01:11:11,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't read any bitterness into any of this.

1061
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:24,768
[SPEAKER_07]: This is someone who loved his job or her job and was proud of the work that they did and found that the entire, just from reading the whole thing, found that the work environment is what soured it.

1062
01:11:25,668 --> 01:11:29,710
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very proud of their work, very proud of what they did, but it was all environmental.

1063
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:35,982
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be interesting to see if this anonymous person is forced to reveal themselves later on or what happens.

1064
01:11:36,222 --> 01:11:37,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to end it with the last line.

1065
01:11:38,303 --> 01:11:44,046
[SPEAKER_07]: We make and made great games and we just want to see the atmosphere and blatant disregard for employee morale improve.

1066
01:11:45,846 --> 01:11:46,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1067
01:11:47,467 --> 01:11:48,067
[SPEAKER_07]: More power to you.

1068
01:11:48,247 --> 01:11:48,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.

1069
01:11:48,908 --> 01:11:49,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

1070
01:11:50,054 --> 01:11:50,354
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1071
01:11:52,115 --> 01:11:57,418
[SPEAKER_09]: So we talked a little bit about Ubisoft and their different DRM that they're going to have for upcoming games.

1072
01:11:57,998 --> 01:12:06,603
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the first ones that was going to take place on console was this new Uplay Passport thing that they were doing with Driver San Francisco.

1073
01:12:08,114 --> 01:12:10,836
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem was it didn't quite go as planned.

1074
01:12:11,696 --> 01:12:21,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Driver San Francisco on Xbox 360 was supposed to include a Uplay passport code required to access multiplayer beyond a 48-hour trial period.

1075
01:12:22,924 --> 01:12:28,828
[SPEAKER_09]: However, they forgot to put the codes in many of the copies that went out.

1076
01:12:31,329 --> 01:12:31,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Brilliant work.

1077
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:42,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so what ended up happening, and this is only really in North America, what ended up happening, though, is the people that bought it, you can actually get the passport for free.

1078
01:12:42,895 --> 01:12:45,596
[SPEAKER_09]: You just either sign in, and there's two options.

1079
01:12:45,636 --> 01:12:56,760
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one to start my two-day free trial, which will not expire now, or select Uplay Passport Purchase, which will be provided at no charge.

1080
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:57,281
[SPEAKER_09]: So,

1081
01:12:58,081 --> 01:13:05,136
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wanted to right now, you could purchase that game for used or whatever and still get online for free.

1082
01:13:06,018 --> 01:13:07,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they fucked up.

1083
01:13:07,621 --> 01:13:09,204
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically the whole thing just went out the window.

1084
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, on the Xbox 360 at least.

1085
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:20,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Still going on the PlayStation 3 because they didn't forget in that one, but Xbox 360 at least they forgot.

1086
01:13:20,141 --> 01:13:22,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's nice and fair.

1087
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,683
[SPEAKER_09]: And surprisingly, the game got pretty good reviews.

1088
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:28,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't think it would be that well, but it did all right.

1089
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:36,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, FromDust on PC had that wonderful online, you have to be always online in order to play the game.

1090
01:13:37,273 --> 01:13:39,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now they have a patch that removes that DRM.

1091
01:13:40,477 --> 01:13:43,620
[SPEAKER_09]: So the title can be played in offline mode as well now.

1092
01:13:46,395 --> 01:13:49,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess a follow-up to that had come up a couple weeks ago.

1093
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:54,300
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that some people were pissed that an extra layer of DRM was added to the Steam version.

1094
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:55,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Not cool.

1095
01:13:57,703 --> 01:14:04,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, moving on to a story about Xbox and some bans going on on Xbox Live.

1096
01:14:05,228 --> 01:14:15,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, Xbox has actually put out a statement this week that they did ban quite a few users this week and it was a result of theft was the keyword they used.

1097
01:14:16,956 --> 01:14:22,981
[SPEAKER_10]: The company, quote, discovered users who were illegitimately accessed Xbox Live Marketplace downloadable content.

1098
01:14:23,341 --> 01:14:29,426
[SPEAKER_10]: This access was intentional and not accidental, constituting a blatant violation of the terms of use for the service.

1099
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:33,509
[SPEAKER_10]: But they won't give any more specifics about what's going on.

1100
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:39,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's known around the internet that there are some ways that you can steal the stuff and Microsoft has finally clamped down on it.

1101
01:14:39,974 --> 01:14:43,037
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not entirely stealing, but yeah, there is a way.

1102
01:14:43,993 --> 01:14:45,714
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you mean it's not entirely stealing?

1103
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:47,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if somebody did that when my account was hacked.

1104
01:15:03,567 --> 01:15:04,867
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll see you next time.

1105
01:15:27,734 --> 01:15:28,835
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I think that's how it works.

1106
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:29,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Never tried it.

1107
01:15:29,395 --> 01:15:33,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say that there's got to be some type of hack that goes there.

1108
01:15:33,376 --> 01:15:50,682
[SPEAKER_10]: For instance, when my 1360 red-ringed and I had to get another, I put on the hard drive with all my old games on it, and if I wasn't connected to the internet, my game would show up as a demo at first, but then it would turn into the real game after I was signed in.

1109
01:15:51,642 --> 01:15:56,708
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think something happens there where it's just the demo version, but when Xbox Live talks to it.

1110
01:15:57,028 --> 01:15:58,770
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not sure how they're pulling that off.

1111
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:01,253
[SPEAKER_10]: There's got to be something a little shady there.

1112
01:16:01,994 --> 01:16:08,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I was hoping at first that this meant they caught the people that were stealing all the people's money, but I guess it doesn't sound like that.

1113
01:16:08,942 --> 01:16:10,824
[SPEAKER_10]: And Microsoft still has not said anything about that.

1114
01:16:10,844 --> 01:16:11,504
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they, in fact...

1115
01:16:12,065 --> 01:16:12,726
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1116
01:16:27,903 --> 01:16:30,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so this is one of those cases where you don't want to share.

1117
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:38,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Majinomicon in our chat says, I wonder if that also applies to the Free Fable 2 glitch that happened a few months ago.

1118
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:40,674
[SPEAKER_10]: I seem to remember that.

1119
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:41,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

1120
01:16:42,195 --> 01:16:50,803
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because that was a legitimate mistake on Microsoft's part that a lot of people went in and just took advantage of, but at the end of the day, that was Microsoft's fault for leaving that switch open.

1121
01:16:50,843 --> 01:16:54,506
[SPEAKER_10]: People weren't hacking their consoles or going around to get it.

1122
01:16:55,046 --> 01:16:56,407
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1123
01:17:18,024 --> 01:17:20,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the next story actually has to do with Pinball FX.

1124
01:17:21,306 --> 01:17:25,248
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the developer says that Microsoft is pretty okay in their book.

1125
01:17:25,848 --> 01:17:32,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, it's kind of putting down on Team Meat for what they said, putting down Microsoft.

1126
01:17:33,432 --> 01:17:38,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a quote on here from Mel Kirk, who is Zen Studio's Vice President of Marketing.

1127
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, they totally have the right to talk about it.

1128
01:17:41,716 --> 01:17:45,657
[SPEAKER_07]: It's terrible they had a bad experience like that, but where we're coming from, when is enough enough?

1129
01:17:45,718 --> 01:17:46,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Let it go already.

1130
01:17:46,898 --> 01:17:51,645
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, they're just like, why are you trying to put them down?

1131
01:17:51,685 --> 01:17:59,194
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not trying to discredit that you've had a bad time from this, but that it's time to get over it, time to move on.

1132
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:02,519
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're apparently sniping back and forth like children.

1133
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,500
[SPEAKER_10]: It was interesting to read.

1134
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:10,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if the tweets are still up, but they're archived around on the internet somewhere, I'm sure.

1135
01:18:10,881 --> 01:18:14,182
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really one of those cases where I read it and I went, really?

1136
01:18:14,242 --> 01:18:19,183
[SPEAKER_10]: People don't think more about the fact that everybody is watching these two companies fight?

1137
01:18:19,383 --> 01:18:22,964
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't very flattering for either one, I think.

1138
01:18:23,344 --> 01:18:27,425
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like anybody who fights on Twitter or on Facebook or whatever.

1139
01:18:27,785 --> 01:18:32,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Emotions are running high, so you don't think before you click post, and then later you sort of regret it.

1140
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:41,689
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was nice to see that it all ended with a, you know, how about a super meat boy skin for pinball or whatever they had said at the end that they kissed and made up and cuddled.

1141
01:18:42,169 --> 01:18:49,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, well, it even says on here that, you know, they're like good for them.

1142
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:50,371
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a good time.

1143
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:52,212
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's great for them.

1144
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:53,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1145
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what the meat boy people said.

1146
01:18:56,670 --> 01:19:02,332
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, it's working on the end, but it did seem kind of- Well, you should have seen the tweets, because the tweets were the equivalent of, fuck you, you fucking fuck.

1147
01:19:02,552 --> 01:19:04,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, that's really how they read to me.

1148
01:19:04,753 --> 01:19:04,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1149
01:19:05,734 --> 01:19:06,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, children.

1150
01:19:07,014 --> 01:19:07,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1151
01:19:07,554 --> 01:19:11,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but it's like someone smacked them on the hand and said, now make nice.

1152
01:19:12,096 --> 01:19:15,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, just the internet went... You guys look dumb right now.

1153
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,721
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're two great games, too.

1154
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:21,444
[SPEAKER_10]: I love both those games, Pinball FX 2 and Meat Boy, so it's kind of sad.

1155
01:19:21,504 --> 01:19:24,467
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like watching your friends fight and you're just sitting there helpless.

1156
01:19:24,487 --> 01:19:25,508
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't do anything about it.

1157
01:19:25,908 --> 01:19:26,589
[SPEAKER_10]: I know how that feels.

1158
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:28,390
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1159
01:19:29,671 --> 01:19:30,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on.

1160
01:19:30,412 --> 01:19:33,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Travel the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out

1161
01:19:34,386 --> 01:19:35,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, let's start in the U.S.

01:19:53,544 --> 01:19:57,486
[SPEAKER_09]: White Knight Chronicles 2 is coming out this week as well.

1163
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:00,907
[SPEAKER_09]: That also includes the first game that's on PlayStation 3.

1164
01:20:15,874 --> 01:20:32,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Camping Mama Outdoors Adventure on Nintendo DS Yes, she is still making games about different things other than cooking New Cooking Mama though coming out later this year Thor God of Thunder on the 3DS It was basically the same version as the ones back in May but now for the 3DS

1165
01:20:33,471 --> 01:20:57,748
[SPEAKER_09]: DECA Sports Extreme coming out for the 3DS, Bit.Trip Saga, which is the collection of all the Bit.Trip games that's on the 3DS this week as well Puzzler Mind Gym on 3DS, Bit.Trip Complete, which is on the Wii, and that also includes the soundtrack for the game as well Call of Juarez the Cartel on PC, Red Orchestra 2, Heroes of Stalingrad on PC

[SPEAKER_09]: Nicktoons MLB, that's on the Xbox 360, Wii, and DS The God of War Origins Collection on PS3 coming out this week Puka Power Up, that's on Nintendo DS Aren't Pukas the little guys in Dig Dug?

1167
01:21:18,234 --> 01:21:22,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no Oh, Puka P-U-C-C, I was thinking P-O-O-K-A

1168
01:21:23,547 --> 01:21:24,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Silly English language!

1169
01:21:24,528 --> 01:21:24,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1170
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:40,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Emily the Strange, Strangerous on the Nintendo DS.

1171
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:42,617
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some dual packs coming out for the PSP.

1172
01:21:42,637 --> 01:21:43,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I was unaware of here.

1173
01:21:44,018 --> 01:21:45,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Mega Man Dual Pack.

1174
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:52,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that's Mega Man Pirate Legends and Mega Man... There was a Mega Man X game as well.

1175
01:21:53,544 --> 01:21:54,345
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on PSP.

1176
01:21:54,725 --> 01:21:56,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Then Monster Hunter Freedom Dual Pack.

1177
01:21:56,566 --> 01:21:59,568
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the two Monster Hunter Freedom games that were out on the PSP over here.

1178
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:03,431
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is it.

1179
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:08,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there.

1180
01:22:08,952 --> 01:22:13,773
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Xbox 360 on September 15th, Dunamis 15 is coming out.

1181
01:22:13,813 --> 01:22:19,555
[SPEAKER_10]: That is not a series I recognize over here, but it is an adventure game that's coming out on the 15th.

1182
01:22:21,255 --> 01:22:27,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's actually the 15th game in a series, but you do get bikini-clad anime girls as part of it.

1183
01:22:27,596 --> 01:22:29,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, she's like wearing a little bra.

1184
01:22:29,997 --> 01:22:30,657
[SPEAKER_10]: They're kind of cute.

1185
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:32,419
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what type of game this is.

1186
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:33,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably another type of sim game.

1187
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,261
[SPEAKER_10]: But it looks like it has these mystery elements.

1188
01:22:36,401 --> 01:22:36,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1189
01:22:37,082 --> 01:22:40,084
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to stop trying to guess what these games are because I'm probably getting it horrifically wrong.

1190
01:22:40,384 --> 01:22:41,385
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is kind of fun to guess.

1191
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:44,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, though, probably not a game we're going to get over here.

1192
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:47,409
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's really it on the 360 this week.

1193
01:22:47,449 --> 01:22:51,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to the PlayStation 3, they're getting that same game, and that's really it on the PlayStation 3.

1194
01:22:52,552 --> 01:22:54,774
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some more stuff coming next week, just so you guys know.

1195
01:22:56,475 --> 01:22:59,637
[SPEAKER_10]: And then going to the handhelds real quick.

1196
01:23:02,318 --> 01:23:05,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Trying to pull up the PSP releases here.

1197
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,381
[SPEAKER_10]: God Eater Burst gets a price reduction.

1198
01:23:08,721 --> 01:23:15,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, as far as new games go, there's Gekka Rioran Romance comes out from Idea Factory this week.

1199
01:23:15,764 --> 01:23:16,645
[SPEAKER_10]: And this game...

1200
01:23:18,847 --> 01:23:20,788
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it could be based off an anime.

1201
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:22,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure.

1202
01:23:22,970 --> 01:23:25,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I just know one of these screenshots says, Dessert.

1203
01:23:25,552 --> 01:23:27,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Prohibited fruits scenario.

1204
01:23:27,734 --> 01:23:30,737
[SPEAKER_10]: So apparently, there's no no fruits in this game.

1205
01:23:32,618 --> 01:23:32,838
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura!

1206
01:23:52,788 --> 01:23:57,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in other news, this is, of course, coming out in the UK.

1207
01:23:57,950 --> 01:24:02,532
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 13th, we have Hard Reset and Red Orchestra, Heroes of Stalingrad.

1208
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:09,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the 14th, we have From Dust, Radiant Silver Gun for Xbox Live Arcade, Renegade Ops, Trackmania 2.

1209
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:11,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the 15th, Moto Heroes.

1210
01:24:13,617 --> 01:24:14,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty.

1211
01:24:14,318 --> 01:24:18,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a couple more stories for you guys, then we got the classic game of the week.

1212
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:19,180
[SPEAKER_10]: But first, Loki.

1213
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:19,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1214
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Infinity Ward is going to get their day in court next year in May on the 7th.

1215
01:24:27,506 --> 01:24:33,851
[SPEAKER_09]: This is, of course, the whole trial where they were suing Activision for royalties unpaid.

1216
01:24:33,892 --> 01:24:43,540
[SPEAKER_09]: They're seeking $125 million in unpaid royalties from the sales of Modern Warfare 2 and also wish to reclaim their contractual rights to the Modern Warfare brand.

1217
01:24:44,781 --> 01:24:45,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1218
01:25:01,644 --> 01:25:03,645
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be me while this thing's in the courtroom.

1219
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:10,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Because even though this isn't a series I'm a big, huge fan of, I'm excited to see somebody do battle with Activision.

1220
01:25:10,428 --> 01:25:11,269
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be interesting.

1221
01:25:12,409 --> 01:25:12,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Any bets?

1222
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:15,571
[SPEAKER_09]: We should place bets on the courtroom.

1223
01:25:15,591 --> 01:25:18,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they're going to get... They probably will get their royalties.

1224
01:25:18,212 --> 01:25:20,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they're going to get the Modern Warfare 2 stuff.

1225
01:25:20,613 --> 01:25:22,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And even if they did, they'd just rename the damn franchise.

1226
01:25:23,534 --> 01:25:24,695
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll still be the same thing, though.

1227
01:25:25,135 --> 01:25:27,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Call of Heroes.

1228
01:25:27,136 --> 01:25:28,257
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it'll still be Call of Duty.

1229
01:25:28,317 --> 01:25:30,778
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll just be... You know...

1230
01:25:31,565 --> 01:25:34,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Modernized Warnis or something.

1231
01:25:36,369 --> 01:25:37,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Warfare Modern.

1232
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:39,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1233
01:25:40,232 --> 01:25:43,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Sony created a new job this week.

1234
01:25:43,694 --> 01:25:53,402
[SPEAKER_10]: They hired a chief information security officer, which probably makes sense considering, oh, you know, they had that huge information breach earlier this year when their system got hacked.

1235
01:25:53,762 --> 01:25:56,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're not fucking around with who they've hired for the position.

1236
01:25:57,145 --> 01:25:58,826
[SPEAKER_10]: They have hired a former U.S.

1237
01:25:58,926 --> 01:26:00,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Homeland Security official.

1238
01:26:00,347 --> 01:26:00,868
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Philip

1239
01:26:01,408 --> 01:26:28,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Titanjer is the new chief information security officer at PlayStation Network no word as to exactly what that person does however what I'm assuming is that he's going to make sure that system never gets hacked again because if it does get hacked again they'll probably hire someone new instead so yep apparently he's not just that but he's also going to be a senior vice president so I imagine he'll have a say in some of the higher level goings-ons of the companies so

1240
01:26:29,006 --> 01:26:32,468
[SPEAKER_10]: He will be reporting to an executive VP in the company.

1241
01:26:33,028 --> 01:26:46,436
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, Sony is making no really holdbacks saying that they are confirming that it's because of the PSN breach saying, quote, we are looking to bolster our network security even further.

1242
01:26:47,256 --> 01:26:49,998
[SPEAKER_10]: So they are going to make sure that doesn't happen again.

1243
01:26:50,698 --> 01:26:54,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if it does happen again, it's going to be really, really bad for everybody.

1244
01:26:55,905 --> 01:27:04,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go back to a simpler time when the systems weren't being hacked and our credit card information wasn't saved on the console.

1245
01:27:04,712 --> 01:27:07,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember when we had consoles and we didn't have to put our credit cards right on?

1246
01:27:07,874 --> 01:27:11,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when your consoles didn't have the memory capacity to save anything?

1247
01:27:11,377 --> 01:27:12,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1248
01:27:12,438 --> 01:27:18,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think this week's classic game did have a memory capacity of some sort, but it was about 16 blocks big.

1249
01:27:18,322 --> 01:27:18,943
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it.

1250
01:27:18,963 --> 01:27:19,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1251
01:27:22,085 --> 01:27:22,405
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1252
01:27:44,529 --> 01:27:49,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of on purpose, but this morning's conversation over breakfast really inspired.

1253
01:27:49,935 --> 01:27:53,319
[SPEAKER_10]: So what is the classic game of the week that surprisingly has never come up before?

1254
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy VII.

1255
01:27:57,304 --> 01:28:00,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy VII came out, well it started development in 1994.

1256
01:28:00,928 --> 01:28:04,252
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was supposed to be on the SNES and then to the Nintendo 64.

1257
01:28:06,093 --> 01:28:11,997
[SPEAKER_07]: But when PlayStation came out, they hopped right on it because the Nintendo 64 couldn't handle the storage.

1258
01:28:14,438 --> 01:28:20,861
[SPEAKER_07]: It was designed and produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi, and the music was by Uematsu Uchiyono.

1259
01:28:20,901 --> 01:28:25,424
[SPEAKER_07]: But this was the first one that Yoshitaka Amano didn't do the character designs for.

1260
01:28:25,924 --> 01:28:28,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It was done by Tetsuya Nomura.

1261
01:28:29,786 --> 01:28:34,111
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, this is one of my favorite games of all time, for the record, I'll say.

1262
01:28:34,951 --> 01:28:45,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so basically, you're this emo boy named Cloud with his hair in his face, and, uh, he goes around being pissed off and not so talkative, and he runs into this whole bag named Aerith.

1263
01:28:47,223 --> 01:28:47,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Tifa, Vincent

1264
01:29:02,597 --> 01:29:02,997
[SPEAKER_07]: And Yuffie?

1265
01:29:03,157 --> 01:29:03,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yuffie was fun?

1266
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:05,639
[SPEAKER_07]: And she had, like, the conformer?

1267
01:29:06,219 --> 01:29:10,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I for real say, the first time I played through this game, I never got Vincent.

1268
01:29:11,103 --> 01:29:15,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even know he was in the game, because I didn't... The internet wasn't really around in the back then.

1269
01:29:15,306 --> 01:29:17,227
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it was, but nobody used it like they do now.

1270
01:29:17,607 --> 01:29:25,632
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and it's... I didn't have Vincent, and I had Aerith in my party as one of, like, my main people that I would constantly use.

1271
01:29:26,053 --> 01:29:28,754
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's just say I wasn't happy by the time this two rolled around.

1272
01:29:28,935 --> 01:29:30,976
[SPEAKER_10]: I was legit... Like, I wasn't sad.

1273
01:29:31,076 --> 01:29:31,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I was fucking mad.

1274
01:29:33,157 --> 01:29:35,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my save file still where she dies.

1275
01:29:35,939 --> 01:29:38,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Spoiler, she gets ganked by Sephiroth.

1276
01:29:39,622 --> 01:29:42,163
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people were pissed off and sad.

1277
01:29:42,203 --> 01:29:44,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at Aerith.

1278
01:29:44,785 --> 01:29:46,286
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a man-stealing ho-bag.

1279
01:29:46,586 --> 01:29:51,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Aerith dies is kind of like the video game equivalent of Darth Vader as Luke's father.

1280
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,091
[SPEAKER_10]: He kills Dumbledore.

1281
01:29:53,111 --> 01:29:54,171
[SPEAKER_10]: We all fucking know.

1282
01:29:54,632 --> 01:29:54,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1283
01:29:56,293 --> 01:29:59,715
[SPEAKER_07]: But at any rate, it's one of my favorite games.

1284
01:30:00,255 --> 01:30:02,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I bred Chocobos like you would not believe.

1285
01:30:02,777 --> 01:30:08,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can breed chocobos and you race them and if you get the black chocobo it can run over the mountains.

1286
01:30:09,459 --> 01:30:15,181
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get another one that runs over the oceans and then you can get the gold chocobo that runs over everything and then you get the airship.

1287
01:30:16,021 --> 01:30:16,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh...

1288
01:30:17,842 --> 01:30:28,568
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, you know, all the little drama, the little side stories, especially with Vincent, the whole Lucretia thing, being Sephiroth's mom and a bunch of crap.

1289
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:31,730
[SPEAKER_07]: But this game has some of my favorite music in it, too.

1290
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:33,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you should totally play.

1291
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:40,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, we'll go back from the battle sound there and check out, let's see, you marked this as your favorite song.

1292
01:30:40,674 --> 01:30:41,615
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my favorite in the game.

1293
01:30:44,737 --> 01:30:45,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a little bit of it.

1294
01:30:47,695 --> 01:30:49,716
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first Jenova battle theme.

1295
01:30:50,376 --> 01:30:52,937
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like my favorite music in the whole damn game.

1296
01:30:53,797 --> 01:30:56,458
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my second favorite is actually more Jenova music.

1297
01:30:56,838 --> 01:30:59,639
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that basically takes the battle theme and kind of redoes it.

1298
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:00,860
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't mind.

1299
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I'll go to that too.

1300
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:02,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1301
01:31:03,121 --> 01:31:06,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll keep going with... Here we go.

1302
01:31:06,182 --> 01:31:06,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a clip.

1303
01:31:11,191 --> 01:31:14,372
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes it so minimalist and then just makes it super dramatic.

1304
01:31:17,513 --> 01:31:19,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so you've got all these other characters.

1305
01:31:19,734 --> 01:31:21,035
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Barret, who cusses.

1306
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:24,596
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sid, who has the best line in the whole game.

1307
01:31:24,616 --> 01:31:27,437
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, sit down in your chair and drink your goddamn tea.

1308
01:31:28,477 --> 01:31:52,670
[SPEAKER_07]: which ended up being quoted in like AOL chats for years and years and years and of course there's Red13 who is a kind of a lion-y looking guy and Katshi which for the record that is how it's pronounced because it's Celtic it's not Kate Sith it's Katshi so I'll let you know I'm muddying the whole internet now I love Kate Sith what are you talking about who ends up being like a Turk controlling the body and everything

1309
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:57,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yeah, this, and of course, you know, there's Sephiroth, because, you know, Sephiroth is what you got.

1310
01:31:58,102 --> 01:32:00,343
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, the story still makes no fucking sense to this day.

1311
01:32:00,483 --> 01:32:01,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it does.

1312
01:32:02,124 --> 01:32:20,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, because basically, it's like the whole Shinra, the big corporation in charge, is sucking the life dry out of the planet, and they're using the energy to do genetic experiments, and they're using, they find this alien thing that lands, and they're using that in their experiments too, hence Sephiroth, who's fucking crazy gonuts.

1313
01:32:21,413 --> 01:32:21,933
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway...

1314
01:32:23,408 --> 01:32:29,392
[SPEAKER_07]: He, uh, he decides he's gonna do what Jenova came to do, and that's destroy every fucking thing.

1315
01:32:29,872 --> 01:32:30,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And Aerith's like, uh-uh, bitch.

1316
01:32:31,733 --> 01:32:33,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though, you know, she's a hobag.

1317
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:34,375
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1318
01:32:39,676 --> 01:32:40,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I got corrected by my husband.

1319
01:32:40,857 --> 01:32:43,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan came in and said, sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.

1320
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:46,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1321
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:51,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, by the way, I did do a little bit of a double take the first time I was playing through this game and the game said shit.

1322
01:32:52,043 --> 01:32:53,724
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, they can do that in games now?

1323
01:32:54,205 --> 01:32:54,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently.

1324
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:56,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the PlayStation.

1325
01:32:56,026 --> 01:32:56,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

1326
01:32:58,068 --> 01:33:05,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So, at any rate, for a little bit more in the development side of that, basically, there are a lot of people involved in this.

1327
01:33:05,312 --> 01:33:06,873
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a really big deal.

1328
01:33:08,193 --> 01:33:13,696
[SPEAKER_07]: It was designed on Power Animator and Softimage 3D, which is early 3D.

1329
01:33:14,236 --> 01:33:16,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, this is before my kids.

1330
01:33:17,798 --> 01:33:21,360
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, before you could just download 3D software, you know, for fun.

1331
01:33:22,191 --> 01:33:32,154
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, but they, the story was pretty much, um, pretty much how, what they had in mind for the Famicom, but they were able to develop it a lot more and bring the 3D in.

1332
01:33:33,095 --> 01:33:36,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, they also included, um, previews of other games.

1333
01:33:36,436 --> 01:33:43,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, basically the demo disc was a pack-in with Tobal number one in Japan, which Tobal number one was also a good game.

1334
01:33:44,495 --> 01:33:46,997
[SPEAKER_07]: and I had previews of Bushido Blade and Saga Frontier.

1335
01:33:48,378 --> 01:33:49,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were just lots of cool stuff.

1336
01:33:49,900 --> 01:34:02,230
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a PC version that came out on Windows, but it was really, when it came out for systems at the time, it was really requirement heavy.

1337
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:05,733
[SPEAKER_07]: It really pushed systems and it played really slow.

1338
01:34:05,873 --> 01:34:07,615
[SPEAKER_07]: It was molasses.

1339
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:17,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Although now I've found that people have done different patches for them where they have the Advent Children thing.

1340
01:34:17,671 --> 01:34:23,113
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a whole Advent Children remake using the Final Fantasy VII PC version.

1341
01:34:24,053 --> 01:34:25,334
[SPEAKER_07]: They've re-skinned, re-musiced.

1342
01:34:26,294 --> 01:34:28,515
[SPEAKER_07]: They've done HD versions.

1343
01:34:28,655 --> 01:34:29,416
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty crazy.

1344
01:34:29,776 --> 01:34:35,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I saw someone actually going through and using the Unreal Engine to re-render whole scenes.

1345
01:34:35,919 --> 01:34:51,059
[SPEAKER_07]: and I was hoping that someone was like there's a fan remake project out there too but they haven't really put anything concrete out there so I was really disappointed with that but I mean you've heard the music it's fantastic I've got the soundtrack it's wonderful

1346
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:59,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Now there's a few things about this game that I got an old, I have a strategy guide that was based off the Japanese version.

1347
01:35:00,082 --> 01:35:02,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really wanted to play the Japanese version for a while.

1348
01:35:03,363 --> 01:35:07,524
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I finally got to borrow my friends and there's this little thing, I was telling you about it this morning, Rob.

1349
01:35:08,324 --> 01:35:11,984
[SPEAKER_07]: These little things called Test Zero that look like blocky Dobermans.

1350
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:18,426
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you go into the Gold Saucer in the prison and go in the well, they hide out in the well, there's three of them, it's a random encounter.

1351
01:35:19,186 --> 01:35:36,113
[SPEAKER_07]: and if you keep attacking them and attacking and attacking and attacking and attacking they will they'll just beg for their life the whole time and then when you kill them you get like a million experience so you can like power level but it's not in the US one I tried not in the US one

1352
01:35:37,133 --> 01:35:40,954
[SPEAKER_07]: There were... This was in the days of dex files.

1353
01:35:41,575 --> 01:35:46,376
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when you had the dex drives and you could download the memory card data.

1354
01:35:48,317 --> 01:35:54,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I always got the Tifa date because I hated Aerith, but I downloaded a save file that had all the other dates.

1355
01:35:54,519 --> 01:35:56,940
[SPEAKER_07]: You could do a date with Aerith, the Hobag.

1356
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:59,740
[SPEAKER_07]: You could do a date with Barret and a date with Yuffie.

1357
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:02,381
[SPEAKER_07]: The Barret date was just funny.

1358
01:36:02,581 --> 01:36:03,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Total bromance.

1359
01:36:03,502 --> 01:36:03,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

1360
01:36:05,683 --> 01:36:08,145
[SPEAKER_07]: And you play the whole game to find out that Cloud's fucking nuts.

1361
01:36:09,145 --> 01:36:10,366
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sephiroth is even crazier.

1362
01:36:11,267 --> 01:36:12,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And Aerith is dead.

1363
01:36:12,908 --> 01:36:13,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is the best part of the game.

1364
01:36:16,551 --> 01:36:21,234
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, there's been rumors of Squeenix doing a remake.

1365
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:24,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's people who said they would love to dedicate the time to it.

1366
01:36:25,217 --> 01:36:27,879
[SPEAKER_07]: To do it with the Final Fantasy XIII style.

1367
01:36:27,899 --> 01:36:29,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically doing it in Unreal Engine.

1368
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,501
[SPEAKER_07]: There are other games related to the series.

1369
01:36:32,521 --> 01:36:38,004
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Crisis Core, which is basically the tale of Zax and Chibi Cloud.

1370
01:36:39,445 --> 01:36:43,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's Dirge of Cerberus, which is a shooting game.

1371
01:36:43,827 --> 01:36:50,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, kind of first-person shooter-y, starring Vincent, which I sadly have but have not yet set down to play.

1372
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:53,932
[SPEAKER_07]: There were the phone games.

1373
01:36:54,412 --> 01:36:54,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember?

1374
01:36:54,893 --> 01:36:55,733
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it?

1375
01:36:56,493 --> 01:36:57,094
[SPEAKER_07]: After Crisis?

1376
01:36:57,114 --> 01:36:57,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1377
01:36:58,195 --> 01:36:58,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Before Crisis.

1378
01:36:58,756 --> 01:37:00,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Before Crisis, that was it, yeah.

1379
01:37:00,798 --> 01:37:02,500
[SPEAKER_07]: It was before Crisis.

1380
01:37:04,102 --> 01:37:09,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's the Advent Children Complete, the DVD thing, which is awesome.

1381
01:37:09,749 --> 01:37:15,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually the ending song has a cameo by Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance.

1382
01:37:15,395 --> 01:37:15,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Just thought I'd...

1383
01:37:16,169 --> 01:37:17,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Only in the Japanese version, which is stupid.

1384
01:37:17,691 --> 01:37:18,031
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway.

1385
01:37:20,074 --> 01:37:21,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one of the best games ever.

1386
01:37:21,115 --> 01:37:28,363
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, Amano went back and did a lot of special art as promotional material for Final Fantasy VII.

1387
01:37:29,504 --> 01:37:30,025
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh...

1388
01:37:32,723 --> 01:37:36,184
[SPEAKER_07]: The only ones that I have of those are what's in my huge mungus Amano art book.

1389
01:37:36,665 --> 01:37:37,985
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can find them online.

1390
01:37:38,005 --> 01:37:38,405
[SPEAKER_07]: They're out there.

1391
01:37:39,325 --> 01:37:41,186
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's Final Fantasy VII.

1392
01:37:41,406 --> 01:37:46,128
[SPEAKER_07]: It's considered... I mean, I think VI was a more solid game.

1393
01:37:47,448 --> 01:38:08,836
[SPEAKER_07]: but 7 is what sits on I'll put it this way I owned two games before I even had a Playstation that I could say was mine one of them was Final Fantasy 7 and the other one was Dragon Ball GT Final Battle which I wish I'd kept on held on to because it was worth money and I traded it for what's that?

1394
01:38:09,457 --> 01:38:15,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue Stinger on Dreamcast for the Japanese version but that's it those are the two games I owned

1395
01:38:16,534 --> 01:38:16,894
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1396
01:38:17,595 --> 01:38:17,955
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is.

1397
01:38:17,995 --> 01:38:19,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Your classic game of the week, everybody.

1398
01:38:20,918 --> 01:38:27,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy VII as we listen to DarkSakura and Dan have a fight about what they did and they didn't own.

1399
01:38:30,107 --> 01:38:33,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lawn Show.

1400
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:34,150
[SPEAKER_10]: But don't go anywhere, you guys.

1401
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:40,977
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to come back for more of Orange Lawn Show with Part B where we're going to talk about one internet service provider might be throttling.

1402
01:38:41,397 --> 01:38:42,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Your bandwidth when it comes to games.

1403
01:38:43,278 --> 01:38:47,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, we're going to talk about some possible serious problems with the Wii U. It might not really work.

1404
01:38:48,262 --> 01:38:48,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit.

1405
01:38:49,342 --> 01:38:50,503
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, rapid fire news.

1406
01:38:50,723 --> 01:38:56,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR, your emails at mailbag at orangelandreale.com, and your calls on the Skype line.

1407
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:57,928
[SPEAKER_10]: All when we come back with more of Orange Landreale.

1408
01:38:58,208 --> 01:39:07,534
[SPEAKER_10]: But before we go to our break tonight, I got to say, I believe Irene, unfortunately, is going to be leaving us because she's got like homework and like real world stuff.

1409
01:39:08,095 --> 01:39:08,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1410
01:39:08,615 --> 01:39:09,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, jeez.

1411
01:39:09,435 --> 01:39:10,896
[SPEAKER_10]: But thanks for sitting in on the show.

1412
01:39:10,956 --> 01:39:13,557
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry you didn't get to talk too much, but... That's okay.

1413
01:39:13,577 --> 01:39:14,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked enough.

1414
01:39:14,617 --> 01:39:15,618
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice to hear from you.

1415
01:39:15,738 --> 01:39:16,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be a stranger.

1416
01:39:17,078 --> 01:39:17,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1417
01:39:17,479 --> 01:39:20,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any parting words you want to say to our listeners tonight?

1418
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:21,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, no.

1419
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:22,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1420
01:39:22,661 --> 01:39:23,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then get out.

1421
01:39:23,321 --> 01:39:23,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1422
01:39:23,601 --> 01:39:24,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

1423
01:39:24,961 --> 01:39:25,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thanks for being here.

1424
01:39:25,902 --> 01:39:33,705
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe we'll hear you at least, if not on OLR in the future, maybe a future episode of Horde House or somewhere in the Orange Lounge Radio family of programming.

1425
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:34,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.

1426
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:35,430
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1427
01:39:35,771 --> 01:39:36,052
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1428
01:39:36,152 --> 01:39:36,372
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1429
01:39:36,773 --> 01:39:37,756
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

1430
01:39:38,176 --> 01:39:39,820
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to take a break, guys, but don't go anywhere.

1431
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,506
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1432
01:39:48,976 --> 01:39:51,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1433
01:39:51,599 --> 01:39:59,066
[SPEAKER_10]: We are live on this Sunday evening, September the 11th of 2011, with the 427th episode of our show.

1434
01:39:59,807 --> 01:40:04,031
[SPEAKER_10]: And we just had a fun Part A there, acknowledging the fact that it is Loki's birthday today.

1435
01:40:04,131 --> 01:40:07,114
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you missed that in Part A, Irene showed up tonight.

1436
01:40:07,174 --> 01:40:10,557
[SPEAKER_10]: She's left, sadly, but she brought Loki some bacon...

1437
01:40:11,258 --> 01:40:12,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan, the man is here in studio joining us.

1438
01:40:12,619 --> 01:40:13,620
[SPEAKER_10]: What have you been playing lately, Dan?

1439
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:14,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan, of course, Dark Sakura's husband.

1440
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,721
[SPEAKER_10]: What have you been up to?

1441
01:40:15,741 --> 01:40:15,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working.

1442
01:40:32,850 --> 01:40:34,191
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not playing games?

1443
01:40:34,551 --> 01:40:35,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't got to play many games.

1444
01:40:35,792 --> 01:40:36,792
[SPEAKER_10]: What is up with that?

1445
01:40:36,873 --> 01:40:38,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's been saying that tonight.

1446
01:40:38,373 --> 01:40:40,115
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been working too much to play games.

1447
01:40:40,935 --> 01:40:41,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand, though.

1448
01:40:41,635 --> 01:40:44,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you just recently started employment again and all that good stuff.

1449
01:40:45,418 --> 01:40:45,938
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's good.

1450
01:40:46,058 --> 01:40:46,579
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing.

1451
01:40:46,919 --> 01:40:48,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I did just pick up a copy of Left 4 Dead 2.

1452
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:49,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1453
01:40:49,821 --> 01:40:55,004
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm too cheap to pay for Xbox Live after getting it for free for the last six years.

1454
01:40:55,404 --> 01:40:55,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1455
01:40:55,824 --> 01:40:58,786
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm kind of like, oh man, three months is $25?

1456
01:40:58,846 --> 01:40:58,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1457
01:41:00,467 --> 01:41:01,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Screw Xbox Live.

1458
01:41:01,888 --> 01:41:03,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't you guys go over to PlayStation 3 then?

1459
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:07,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Because none of the people I play games with have a PlayStation 3.

1460
01:41:07,632 --> 01:41:10,214
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I apologize.

1461
01:41:10,254 --> 01:41:11,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I forget who said this in chat.

1462
01:41:11,975 --> 01:41:16,998
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a question that came up and it scrolled by, but it was while DarkSakura was doing the Classic Game of the Week, so I couldn't bring it up.

1463
01:41:17,519 --> 01:41:29,767
[SPEAKER_10]: But to summarize, the question was, if a game is available on multiple platforms, including PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, what goes into your decision to decide what console you get the game on?

1464
01:41:30,507 --> 01:41:57,327
[SPEAKER_10]: and for me certainly price weighs into it and bonus features and things of that sort but it's really about like where are my friends playing and most of the time if it's online they're probably on Xbox Live but there have been games that I bought on PlayStation 3 for the simple fact I am not going to use the fucking Xbox controller to play this game my decision for playing some of these is who can I borrow it from I'm kind of the opposite I like the 360 controller

1465
01:41:58,416 --> 01:41:58,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1466
01:41:59,117 --> 01:42:00,598
[SPEAKER_10]: But for some games I can't stand it.

1467
01:42:00,618 --> 01:42:06,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Super Street Fighter 4, I bought it on the PlayStation 3 simply because I can't fucking stand the Xbox 360 controller for fighters.

1468
01:42:06,142 --> 01:42:07,423
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why God made arcade sticks.

1469
01:42:07,843 --> 01:42:09,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I don't want to buy an arcade stick.

1470
01:42:10,285 --> 01:42:10,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you do.

1471
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of do, you're right.

1472
01:42:12,867 --> 01:42:13,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Told ya.

1473
01:42:14,188 --> 01:42:16,810
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some games I would like to play with an arcade joystick.

1474
01:42:18,271 --> 01:42:20,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so Left 4 Dead 2, gonna get back into that.

1475
01:42:20,472 --> 01:42:21,213
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess you got some friends.

1476
01:42:21,253 --> 01:42:22,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never really started on that.

1477
01:42:22,634 --> 01:42:26,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I played the demo of both Left 4 Deads and I was always like...

1478
01:42:27,509 --> 01:42:29,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like a first-person shooter.

1479
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:34,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like it might be kind of cool if I was playing with other people, but it's no fun to play by yourself.

1480
01:42:35,151 --> 01:42:41,713
[SPEAKER_10]: I've watched Salacious Pop play a little bit of that, and it looks interesting, but I tried to play it, and I am fucking terrible at it.

1481
01:42:41,873 --> 01:42:45,654
[SPEAKER_10]: You just need to find more people that have it in the system link.

1482
01:42:45,834 --> 01:42:47,095
[SPEAKER_10]: It's such a team-based game.

1483
01:42:47,235 --> 01:42:48,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I just bring the team down.

1484
01:42:49,415 --> 01:42:51,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the problem is one of the people we're going to play with is in Washington.

1485
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:56,154
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't have that long of an Ethernet cable.

1486
01:42:57,316 --> 01:43:00,560
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone has an 800-mile Ethernet cable, hook it up.

1487
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:03,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, XLink Kai, you can do that.

1488
01:43:03,865 --> 01:43:05,507
[SPEAKER_09]: That's system link over the Internet.

1489
01:43:05,767 --> 01:43:07,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, like the GameSpy tunnel thing they used to do?

1490
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:08,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1491
01:43:08,871 --> 01:43:09,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

1492
01:43:09,793 --> 01:43:32,223
[SPEAKER_10]: but the one component that I have a hard time kind of defining like when I would buy a game for is the PC because I'm kind of like oh PC games are usually pretty niche and a lot of times like games I buy on the PC or only on the PC Diablo 3 would be a good example like although it's very likely Diablo 3 is coming to console I'm not gonna wait for it like I want it like when it fucking comes out so

1493
01:43:32,663 --> 01:43:57,189
[SPEAKER_10]: and about Starcraft 2 on PC about Civilization 5 on PC those games only exist on PC the cross-platform stuff I tend to gravitate towards the consoles strictly because I like to curl up on the couch play the game like I don't know there's just PC games has a different maybe it's ridiculous I don't know but just like sitting in the office chair playing my PC games is not the same to me as being on the couch I love Steam all lazy

1494
01:43:57,609 --> 01:44:03,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but then, yeah, and Steam will occasionally have those really fucking good sales that will make me want to buy a game on it.

1495
01:44:04,631 --> 01:44:04,831
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

1496
01:44:05,111 --> 01:44:05,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I was broken.

1497
01:44:06,131 --> 01:44:06,291
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

1498
01:44:06,831 --> 01:44:11,172
[SPEAKER_10]: But, like, Portal's a good example of a game I bought on PC because it was a really good fucking deal.

1499
01:44:11,212 --> 01:44:12,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I prefer playing it on PC.

1500
01:44:13,052 --> 01:44:15,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for me, it's just easier to control, even with my trackball mouse.

1501
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:17,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, that's a keyboard mouse thing, right?

1502
01:44:17,433 --> 01:44:17,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1503
01:44:19,194 --> 01:44:19,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1504
01:44:19,974 --> 01:44:24,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Portal on my PC because it looked better, but I used a 360 controller.

1505
01:44:24,275 --> 01:44:24,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1506
01:44:25,783 --> 01:44:27,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting, okay.

1507
01:44:27,744 --> 01:44:30,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried playing it with a 360 controller and I just didn't like it.

1508
01:44:30,325 --> 01:44:31,465
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't very intuitive to me.

1509
01:44:31,485 --> 01:44:34,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I played DC Universe on the PC, but I played with a controller.

1510
01:44:35,167 --> 01:44:38,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I was, you know, I was stuck on using a controller forever.

1511
01:44:38,608 --> 01:44:40,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when I played Final Fantasy XI, I used a controller.

1512
01:44:40,989 --> 01:44:43,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I had all my macros cued to my trigger buttons and everything.

1513
01:44:44,531 --> 01:44:48,973
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played PSO, you know, with a controller.

1514
01:44:49,293 --> 01:44:53,935
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't until I started playing World of Warcraft that I started playing keyboard and mouse.

1515
01:44:55,163 --> 01:45:01,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Something that came up on this week's Horde House, plug, plug, the show I do all about, all things World of Warcraft at www.hordehouse.com.

1516
01:45:01,766 --> 01:45:03,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Never too seriously, though, with Extifer.

1517
01:45:03,887 --> 01:45:09,549
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things he brought up this week was that his brother-in-law likes to play World of Warcraft, I guess something he's been getting into, on a PS3 controller.

1518
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:11,070
[SPEAKER_10]: And, like, it actually kind of works.

1519
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:17,173
[SPEAKER_10]: And the way it, it's very similar to how Final Fantasy XI played on the PlayStation 2 controller, where you have to kind of macro things to buttons.

1520
01:45:17,653 --> 01:45:18,673
[SPEAKER_10]: But it actually kind of works.

1521
01:45:18,733 --> 01:45:20,074
[SPEAKER_10]: He was doing quests with them and everything.

1522
01:45:20,094 --> 01:45:24,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the only thing that gets a little wonky, I think, he said was the camera gets a little weird.

1523
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:25,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see that.

1524
01:45:25,417 --> 01:45:26,680
[SPEAKER_10]: But I found that to be very interesting.

1525
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:30,687
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, if he's fast enough with macro attacks, I bet using controller would make him really good for PvP.

1526
01:45:31,778 --> 01:45:33,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, could be very interesting.

1527
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:35,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can't do PvP because I can't mouse turn with my mouse.

1528
01:45:37,103 --> 01:45:40,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I just do hide in the corner while everyone else does PvP.

1529
01:45:41,948 --> 01:45:43,489
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why the big battlegrounds are fun.

1530
01:45:43,569 --> 01:45:44,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's why.

1531
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:45,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the big battlegrounds.

1532
01:45:45,511 --> 01:45:50,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I guess it's really just a number of factors that go into the decision.

1533
01:45:50,996 --> 01:45:54,720
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't sit here and say, oh, I would always go PS3 because I don't.

1534
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:55,721
[SPEAKER_10]: It just kind of...

1535
01:45:56,221 --> 01:45:57,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's everyone else going to be?

1536
01:45:57,702 --> 01:45:59,122
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of game is it?

1537
01:45:59,202 --> 01:46:00,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Where am I going to be playing it the most?

1538
01:46:01,223 --> 01:46:02,364
[SPEAKER_10]: All those things kind of weigh into it.

1539
01:46:02,444 --> 01:46:06,565
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, I really just prefer almost anything on Xbox 360.

1540
01:46:06,625 --> 01:46:12,868
[SPEAKER_07]: The controller feels pretty comfortable to my hand because I have to have a slightly wider reach on the PS3.

1541
01:46:13,808 --> 01:46:18,330
[SPEAKER_07]: And the way that the little parts that stick out sit on my hand is because of my surgery, really.

1542
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:20,291
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's hard for me.

1543
01:46:20,831 --> 01:46:21,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say this.

1544
01:46:21,632 --> 01:46:31,217
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad I have the choice, and I realize not everyone invests in the 360 and the PS3 and a high-end PC capable of running today's games.

1545
01:46:31,557 --> 01:46:40,402
[SPEAKER_10]: I realize not everybody can juggle all those things, but I like that I'm fortunate enough where I have been able to have all those so I can make the decision.

1546
01:46:41,496 --> 01:46:45,117
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, I just got completely lightheaded once the sugar hit my brain.

1547
01:46:45,597 --> 01:46:46,337
[SPEAKER_10]: From those cupcakes?

1548
01:46:46,737 --> 01:46:47,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1549
01:46:47,257 --> 01:46:47,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

1550
01:46:48,478 --> 01:46:49,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And my stomach aches.

1551
01:46:49,158 --> 01:46:51,358
[SPEAKER_09]: The butter and the buttercream is kind of making me feel sick.

1552
01:46:51,438 --> 01:46:52,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I only ate one.

1553
01:46:52,318 --> 01:46:52,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm eating it anyway.

1554
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:56,159
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a frappuccino on the way in here and that was enough sugar so I didn't need it.

1555
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:59,720
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get you the other lid for another lid for that other container.

1556
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:02,681
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys all know how I feel about pumpkin and pumpkin spice frappuccinos.

1557
01:47:02,901 --> 01:47:05,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a pumpkin spice muffin right the hell now.

1558
01:47:05,781 --> 01:47:07,742
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've been wanting one since breakfast.

1559
01:47:09,262 --> 01:47:11,624
[SPEAKER_10]: You better go now before all the Starbucks close.

1560
01:47:13,065 --> 01:47:13,426
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1561
01:47:13,486 --> 01:47:18,770
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have had pumpkin at... No, because I didn't like the pumpkin at Pinkberry.

1562
01:47:19,811 --> 01:47:21,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I love the pumpkin at Pinkberry.

1563
01:47:21,032 --> 01:47:21,452
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good.

1564
01:47:22,353 --> 01:47:23,194
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't as good.

1565
01:47:23,254 --> 01:47:24,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, let's move on.

1566
01:47:26,476 --> 01:47:27,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get into rapid fire news.

1567
01:47:27,777 --> 01:47:28,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to gaming news.

1568
01:47:29,178 --> 01:47:33,202
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of quick stories we want to talk about with you guys before we get to some of the other stuff.

1569
01:47:35,243 --> 01:47:35,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, start us off.

1570
01:47:37,094 --> 01:47:42,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like they did with the Resident Evil series, they're going to be bringing HD remakes of Devil May Cry 1, 2, and 3.

1571
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:46,710
[SPEAKER_09]: to the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

1572
01:48:13,835 --> 01:48:16,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Look forward to an announcement I'm sure soon.

1573
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:26,109
[SPEAKER_09]: And to kind of go along with that, Crysis, rumored to be coming to the new consoles, now has...

1574
01:48:28,703 --> 01:48:32,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's going to be coming to the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this October.

1575
01:48:33,025 --> 01:48:36,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Also coming, I believe, from a leak as well.

1576
01:48:37,628 --> 01:48:39,989
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, these games are going to be remastered.

1577
01:48:40,009 --> 01:48:42,450
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be also available in 3D.

1578
01:48:43,291 --> 01:48:46,492
[SPEAKER_09]: And they announced that they're going to be 1,600 Microsoft points or 1,999.

1579
01:48:49,194 --> 01:48:49,954
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

1580
01:48:50,875 --> 01:48:51,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And those will be coming soon.

1581
01:48:51,835 --> 01:48:53,756
[SPEAKER_09]: And the original price, this was a really good game.

1582
01:48:53,836 --> 01:48:54,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Just...

1583
01:48:55,897 --> 01:49:01,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't finish mine on the PC because, well, it wouldn't let me.

1584
01:49:02,766 --> 01:49:03,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad glitches.

1585
01:49:04,869 --> 01:49:09,675
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, last but not least, there's this trend, I wouldn't say it's a

1586
01:49:11,092 --> 01:49:12,553
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1587
01:49:28,206 --> 01:49:28,947
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1588
01:49:44,068 --> 01:49:45,489
[SPEAKER_09]: and whatnot.

1589
01:49:46,170 --> 01:49:57,539
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, apparently this guy had it happen and the police chief believes that the griefer is hacked into a 911 text messaging service to pull off the griefing.

1590
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:06,306
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have officers responding lights and sirens to a call they think is an emergency in progress and they get there only to find out it's a hoax.

1591
01:50:07,807 --> 01:50:08,828
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fucked up.

1592
01:50:08,868 --> 01:50:13,972
[SPEAKER_09]: There's 100 documented cases so far the FBI is tracking.

1593
01:50:14,933 --> 01:50:17,075
[SPEAKER_09]: All the way from Oregon through Florida.

1594
01:50:18,976 --> 01:50:21,058
[SPEAKER_10]: That is so fucked up to do that.

1595
01:50:21,078 --> 01:50:22,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Freaking juvenile.

1596
01:50:22,259 --> 01:50:24,721
[SPEAKER_10]: That better fucking come around to bite these people in the ass.

1597
01:50:24,741 --> 01:50:28,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Because not only is it just fucked up to do to somebody, but that is such a waste of money.

1598
01:50:28,884 --> 01:50:32,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the police department, the fire department, they've got to take that shit seriously, you know?

1599
01:50:32,647 --> 01:50:36,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's thousands of dollars of our money that's spent on these lols.

1600
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:38,632
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not fucking funny, you know what I mean?

1601
01:50:39,132 --> 01:50:39,933
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just sad.

1602
01:50:40,653 --> 01:50:41,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Very unfortunate.

1603
01:50:41,834 --> 01:50:44,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I'd have to ask is how the fuck did they get the guy's address?

1604
01:50:46,826 --> 01:50:47,926
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a very good question.

1605
01:50:48,467 --> 01:50:51,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, probably more hacking of some sort.

1606
01:50:52,748 --> 01:50:55,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Could it be as simple as the guys in the white pages?

1607
01:50:55,869 --> 01:50:57,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that even exist anymore?

1608
01:50:57,110 --> 01:50:58,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it does.

1609
01:50:58,070 --> 01:50:59,051
[SPEAKER_10]: There are still phone books.

1610
01:50:59,431 --> 01:51:02,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they drop a phone book off at my doorstep every once in a while.

1611
01:51:03,272 --> 01:51:04,893
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a big advertisement for all the companies.

1612
01:51:04,933 --> 01:51:05,573
[SPEAKER_09]: So you know what?

1613
01:51:06,053 --> 01:51:09,855
[SPEAKER_09]: In the day and age that we live in right now with the internet, I just throw that shit in the garbage.

1614
01:51:09,875 --> 01:51:10,895
[SPEAKER_10]: A phone book's a waste of money.

1615
01:51:11,295 --> 01:51:11,935
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unfortunate.

1616
01:51:12,836 --> 01:51:13,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

1617
01:51:13,716 --> 01:51:14,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on to some more news.

1618
01:51:15,358 --> 01:51:22,523
[SPEAKER_10]: The SimSocial we mentioned earlier, it is currently a more active game than FarmVille on Facebook.

1619
01:51:22,563 --> 01:51:26,847
[SPEAKER_10]: So SimSocial has now actually surpassed FarmVille in the amount of daily active users.

1620
01:51:27,207 --> 01:51:32,451
[SPEAKER_10]: The SimSocial is seeing an average of 9.3 million active users per day.

1621
01:51:32,991 --> 01:51:37,175
[SPEAKER_10]: They play, on the average, three times a day in 15 to 20 minute increments.

1622
01:51:37,195 --> 01:51:39,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, if you're DarkSakura, that's backwards.

1623
01:51:39,256 --> 01:51:42,419
[SPEAKER_10]: She plays 15 to 20 times a day in three minute increments.

1624
01:51:43,707 --> 01:52:09,777
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty true Okay, I'm not kidding Anyhow, Farmville still has 8.1 million people But the most popular game on Facebook right now Cityville, also by Zynga 13.9 million users a day The only app that gets more traffic than that Is Windows Messenger Live Which is somehow integrated into Facebook I've never even used that There you go What isn't said is how much fucking wall spam Has gone out because of this app

1625
01:52:10,984 --> 01:52:14,265
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of those things I hate that I play it, but I can't stop playing ARG.

1626
01:52:15,285 --> 01:52:16,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I would block people that did that.

1627
01:52:16,926 --> 01:52:20,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a game that I can't be sad about enjoying because it's really fucking good.

1628
01:52:20,746 --> 01:52:21,507
[SPEAKER_10]: LittleBigPlanet 2.

1629
01:52:22,167 --> 01:52:26,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, so I haven't really played the sequel like I've played the original, but I will at some point.

1630
01:52:26,288 --> 01:52:27,248
[SPEAKER_10]: It just went on sale.

1631
01:52:27,288 --> 01:52:28,348
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to get it.

1632
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:31,489
[SPEAKER_10]: LittleBigPlanet 2 just got its Move patch.

1633
01:52:32,089 --> 01:52:33,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I could loan it to you.

1634
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:34,630
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be great.

1635
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:46,360
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going live just yet until the Move Pack goes out, but Update 1.06 is out, which does release some new sensors, some limiting players on homebrew levels.

1636
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:49,183
[SPEAKER_10]: You can control the basic game with the Move Controller now.

1637
01:52:49,283 --> 01:52:58,150
[SPEAKER_10]: So all that stuff is setting up to take away for the Move Support officially in LittleBigPlanet 2, which comes with the Move Pack very, very, very soon.

1638
01:52:59,391 --> 01:53:07,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Lastly, if you build games a little more seriously than LittleBigPlanet 2, not to say LittleBigPlanet isn't serious business, but this is real serious business.

1639
01:53:08,473 --> 01:53:10,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Raw source code of popular games.

1640
01:53:10,773 --> 01:53:11,433
[SPEAKER_10]: How popular?

1641
01:53:11,913 --> 01:53:15,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Wolfenstein 3D Platinum and Doom Classic.

1642
01:53:15,774 --> 01:53:16,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry, guys.

1643
01:53:16,654 --> 01:53:17,534
[SPEAKER_10]: This is legit.

1644
01:53:17,754 --> 01:53:20,535
[SPEAKER_10]: ID Software actually released the source codes themselves.

1645
01:53:20,895 --> 01:53:22,935
[SPEAKER_10]: You can go get the source codes for these games.

1646
01:53:24,135 --> 01:53:25,116
[SPEAKER_10]: And there you go.

1647
01:53:25,196 --> 01:53:25,836
[SPEAKER_10]: It's update 2.1.

1648
01:53:29,162 --> 01:53:42,442
[SPEAKER_10]: and you can go grab the source code and tinker away at that I'd be excited to see what kind of games come out of that I think the Wolfenstein code had been released before and this is some type of upgrade but there you go moving on DarkSakura what do you have for us

1649
01:53:43,746 --> 01:53:44,726
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Max Technica

1650
01:54:01,171 --> 01:54:04,273
[SPEAKER_07]: and that it's going to use both the touchscreen and the rear touch panel.

1651
01:54:04,573 --> 01:54:05,074
[SPEAKER_07]: So who knows?

1652
01:54:05,594 --> 01:54:11,818
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes a lot of sense considering that, you know, when I heard about this, I was like, oh yeah, because the game is basically on a giant touchscreen.

1653
01:54:12,038 --> 01:54:13,239
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically Elite Beat Agents.

1654
01:54:13,459 --> 01:54:13,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1655
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:25,426
[SPEAKER_07]: And then other news, Microsoft says 42% of US Xbox Live Gold members watch an average of an hour of video content a day.

1656
01:54:26,426 --> 01:54:29,628
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's including Hulu Plus, Netflix and Zoom on Xbox 360.

1657
01:54:29,668 --> 01:54:29,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1658
01:54:30,969 --> 01:54:36,091
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like there are going to be quite a bit more going on.

1659
01:54:36,591 --> 01:54:47,354
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, it was reported by Terry Farrell, not to be confused with the lady that played Judzia Dax, who is the senior product manager of Xbox Live Entertainment.

1660
01:54:47,954 --> 01:54:48,914
[SPEAKER_07]: This report comes from him.

1661
01:54:49,094 --> 01:54:54,116
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to definitely be working to up that in the fall dashboard update.

1662
01:54:55,717 --> 01:54:58,519
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, sad, sad, sad news.

1663
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:03,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Game writing pioneer Bill Kunkel passed away.

1664
01:55:04,243 --> 01:55:04,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Very sad.

1665
01:55:04,863 --> 01:55:06,384
[SPEAKER_07]: He died on September 4th.

1666
01:55:07,045 --> 01:55:08,666
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the Game Doctor.

1667
01:55:09,106 --> 01:55:10,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it sound familiar to anybody?

1668
01:55:10,767 --> 01:55:16,231
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally remember the Game Doctor columns from the old magazines from back in the, oh God, that was the 80s.

1669
01:55:16,251 --> 01:55:17,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Computer gaming world?

1670
01:55:18,433 --> 01:55:19,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Video game computer entertainment, right?

1671
01:55:20,314 --> 01:55:46,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep And the original Electronic Games, not to be confused with Electronic Gaming Monthly Yeah Oh yeah, I remember those magazines, we had them all That and the Commodore 64 magazines, but Bill wasn't a part of those I don't think Well, he was 61 years old And he'd been working on video game columns since 1978 And he co-founded EGM Wow He will be missed

1672
01:55:48,350 --> 01:56:15,588
[SPEAKER_07]: as I understand it he was working right up until the unfortunate because the death was unexpected as I hear so he was still doing some work on websites and so forth so it's surprising it's very unfortunate I'm pulling up a list of other things that he worked on because he said he also did stuff for DC and Marvel actually also worked with KKWD Fog Studios Metropolis Media

1673
01:56:17,503 --> 01:56:18,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of stuff.

1674
01:56:19,605 --> 01:56:23,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And did a lot of the strategy guides for Prima.

1675
01:56:24,128 --> 01:56:24,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

1676
01:56:24,849 --> 01:56:33,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Maximum Carnage, Descent, FPS Baseball, Gex, Die Hard Trilogy, NFL Quarterback Club 98, Madden 64, and Brady.

1677
01:56:33,696 --> 01:56:36,518
[SPEAKER_10]: So he was actually getting into game development at some point.

1678
01:56:36,618 --> 01:56:38,700
[SPEAKER_07]: He did Madden 64 for a Brady game.

1679
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:39,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I see.

1680
01:56:39,701 --> 01:56:39,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1681
01:56:39,961 --> 01:56:40,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1682
01:56:41,062 --> 01:56:41,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1683
01:56:41,582 --> 01:56:43,323
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, pretty crazy stuff.

1684
01:56:44,064 --> 01:56:44,544
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too bad.

1685
01:56:45,084 --> 01:56:45,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, too bad.

1686
01:56:46,605 --> 01:56:46,926
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1687
01:56:47,426 --> 01:56:49,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's it for our quick news tonight.

1688
01:56:49,507 --> 01:56:52,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's get back into more news.

1689
01:56:52,610 --> 01:56:55,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why we have the quick news and the long news, but that's just the way we've been doing it.

1690
01:56:56,252 --> 01:56:56,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

1691
01:56:56,732 --> 01:56:57,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on, Loki.

1692
01:56:59,714 --> 01:57:10,098
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you may remember that during Gamescom they announced that the PSP is going to be getting a new version out in Europe that was going to be Sans Wi-Fi.

1693
01:57:10,759 --> 01:57:17,262
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm kind of wondering why they went ahead and did this seeing as the Vita is going to be coming out soon.

1694
01:57:18,162 --> 01:57:21,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, one of the things that they're trying to do is target teens.

1695
01:57:22,466 --> 01:57:23,606
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all for the audience.

1696
01:57:23,646 --> 01:57:29,070
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're going to take PSP very young, teens and much younger, they're happy to just play the game.

1697
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:34,094
[SPEAKER_09]: If taking Wi-Fi out is the price to pay, we're happy to do it.

1698
01:57:36,456 --> 01:57:42,160
[SPEAKER_09]: They also believe that the price point will give the console a much-needed sales bump, especially during the upcoming holiday season.

1699
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:49,582
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're saying that at, you know, 99 euro, it'll make a great Christmas gift.

1700
01:57:50,502 --> 01:57:54,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the new system's dubbed the E1000.

1701
01:57:54,924 --> 01:58:02,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I mean, if you're really looking for a PSP system, you can buy...

1702
01:58:03,837 --> 01:58:04,237
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1703
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:28,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that, but they are connected to the internet.

1704
01:58:29,124 --> 01:58:31,806
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like they're saying, well, teenagers are just happy to play the game.

1705
01:58:32,267 --> 01:58:35,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, some of them are just happy to play the games, but you know what?

1706
01:58:36,371 --> 01:58:45,179
[SPEAKER_09]: You can still buy one of your older PSP systems and have that functionality in there for the same price, if not cheaper.

1707
01:58:45,796 --> 01:58:56,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you heard that whole, not to deviate too much from the story, but have you heard that whole story about how the kids at some schools in certain districts are now, instead of getting textbooks, they get iPads with the books on them?

1708
01:58:57,460 --> 01:59:01,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, believe it or not, a $600 iPad or whatever, well, what's the lowest one cost?

1709
01:59:01,861 --> 01:59:02,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe $400?

1710
01:59:02,901 --> 01:59:06,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Those iPads are cheaper than some of the textbooks for all those classes combined.

1711
01:59:07,262 --> 01:59:09,103
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the iPad is becoming a cheaper alternative.

1712
01:59:09,503 --> 01:59:10,303
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crazy.

1713
01:59:10,543 --> 01:59:11,364
[SPEAKER_09]: To the textbooks.

1714
01:59:11,704 --> 01:59:11,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1715
01:59:12,364 --> 01:59:12,944
[SPEAKER_09]: How about this?

1716
01:59:13,064 --> 01:59:22,628
[SPEAKER_09]: How about instead of spending $500 on an iPad, which granted is a good piece of technology, but how about you spend it on a cheaper e-reader and you can put those books on there?

1717
01:59:22,648 --> 01:59:24,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, you can get HP touchpads for $100.

1718
01:59:24,389 --> 01:59:26,310
[SPEAKER_10]: They should have got in on that deal.

1719
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:34,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if it's reading just books, that's all it's doing, I think there's cheaper alternatives out there than just that.

1720
01:59:35,214 --> 01:59:36,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Or here's an idea.

1721
01:59:37,677 --> 01:59:46,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much everybody nowadays in school and stuff, and I know that there's people out there that are without a substantial income.

1722
01:59:46,964 --> 01:59:49,986
[SPEAKER_09]: But you gotta admit, most people probably have a PC at home.

1723
01:59:50,927 --> 01:59:52,928
[SPEAKER_09]: The majority of people out there have a PC.

1724
01:59:54,189 --> 01:59:56,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Just give it to them in a PDF format or something like that.

1725
01:59:56,571 --> 01:59:58,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess if you're bringing it to school.

1726
02:00:00,223 --> 02:00:05,106
[SPEAKER_09]: A desktop, you could have a desktop computer at each one of these desks.

1727
02:00:05,166 --> 02:00:08,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot do now.

1728
02:00:08,408 --> 02:00:12,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and then just have the book on there.

1729
02:00:12,971 --> 02:00:13,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeez.

1730
02:00:14,012 --> 02:00:19,375
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, going to our chatroom at chat.orange.com, taking you back to what the story was originally about before we got on that tangent.

1731
02:00:19,896 --> 02:00:24,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Toagak in our chatroom says, you want to know what my PSP is used for?

1732
02:00:24,038 --> 02:00:24,739
[SPEAKER_10]: 99% Wi-Fi, 1% games.

1733
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:28,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard that a lot.

1734
02:00:28,121 --> 02:00:35,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Not so much the teenage crowd, but the college crowd really loves that the PSP is a web browser, an MP3 player, and it happens to play games.

1735
02:00:36,368 --> 02:00:39,090
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've said this a million times on the show before.

1736
02:00:39,110 --> 02:00:40,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm starting to sound like a broken record.

1737
02:00:40,831 --> 02:00:44,474
[SPEAKER_10]: The PSP's biggest strength was always the fact that it didn't just do games.

1738
02:00:44,514 --> 02:00:49,138
[SPEAKER_10]: It did, well, like their little tagline, it only does everything, and that really is Sony's strength.

1739
02:00:49,758 --> 02:00:52,200
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to do much, though, when it doesn't have Wi-Fi.

1740
02:00:52,561 --> 02:00:53,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1741
02:00:53,701 --> 02:00:55,463
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like, it only does nothing.

1742
02:00:57,867 --> 02:00:58,807
[SPEAKER_10]: is what this system does.

1743
02:00:59,087 --> 02:01:02,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't understand what the point is because they're all, well, help bump sales.

1744
02:01:03,729 --> 02:01:10,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about the Europe region, but in the US and North America, there's not a lot of PSP games coming out.

1745
02:01:10,371 --> 02:01:11,271
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like five.

1746
02:01:11,871 --> 02:01:13,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Five for the whole fourth quarter.

1747
02:01:14,293 --> 02:01:20,037
[SPEAKER_10]: I was fascinated to go to Fry's today as I was talking about before and see that they are still selling the PSP movies.

1748
02:01:21,078 --> 02:01:22,559
[SPEAKER_10]: You can still buy PSP movies.

1749
02:01:22,799 --> 02:01:26,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, probably got them for a good deal because no one's selling them anymore.

1750
02:01:26,482 --> 02:01:28,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, five to ten bucks tops.

1751
02:01:28,424 --> 02:01:32,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony was the only one for the longest time that was putting out movies on that system.

1752
02:01:32,447 --> 02:01:35,669
[SPEAKER_09]: The last movie I remember on the UMD format was 2012.

1753
02:01:36,170 --> 02:01:36,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1754
02:01:39,432 --> 02:01:42,734
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a Sony title, so obviously that makes sense why that would be on there.

1755
02:01:42,874 --> 02:01:44,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it sort of makes sense.

1756
02:01:45,295 --> 02:01:47,776
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, those things are dirt cheap now.

1757
02:01:48,056 --> 02:01:49,957
[SPEAKER_09]: They're definitely not manufacturing them anymore.

1758
02:01:49,997 --> 02:01:52,679
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, I don't understand the point.

1759
02:01:52,699 --> 02:01:55,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, of course they want their system to sell well, but...

1760
02:01:57,265 --> 02:02:18,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I think removing a pretty integral feature from the system that once again you know with the whole PSP Go and stuff you don't need to reinvent the system to help itself I mean why are you gonna spend more money on a system that does less I mean that's the whole point here why would I spend more money on a system that doesn't have Wi-Fi when I can yeah use this in preferred but you know what

1761
02:02:20,905 --> 02:02:25,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Those so-called teenagers probably don't give a shit that it's a little bit used.

1762
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:29,153
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will come with games for less than that.

1763
02:02:29,513 --> 02:02:31,735
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I think I was taking a look here.

1764
02:02:31,955 --> 02:02:36,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw some used PSP systems on eBay.

1765
02:02:37,981 --> 02:02:39,202
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see here.

1766
02:02:39,882 --> 02:02:41,904
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got the Gigapack or whatever. $65.

1767
02:02:43,866 --> 02:02:44,386
[SPEAKER_09]: and many more.

1768
02:03:10,113 --> 02:03:12,595
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're region-free, so why not?

1769
02:03:12,715 --> 02:03:14,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Or at this point, you might as well just wait for the Vita.

1770
02:03:16,357 --> 02:03:16,658
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1771
02:03:16,858 --> 02:03:17,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Or get something else.

1772
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:20,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, moving on to a totally different topic.

1773
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:24,043
[SPEAKER_10]: This is about not getting between somebody and their bandwidth.

1774
02:03:24,083 --> 02:03:30,627
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, nothing gets the internet rabble-rabbled more than hearing about internet service providers and their recent restrictions.

1775
02:03:31,107 --> 02:03:33,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this has to do with a Canadian provider, actually.

1776
02:03:33,889 --> 02:03:39,413
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to do with Rogers Cable and Telcom, who's Canada's largest broadband provider.

1777
02:03:39,873 --> 02:03:47,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, they had some complaints from World of Warcraft players saying that the World of Warcraft traffic was being throttled.

1778
02:03:47,437 --> 02:03:49,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, oh my gosh, that just goes double so.

1779
02:03:49,597 --> 02:03:54,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not get between, and I say this as a Warcraft player, do not get between me and my WoW.

1780
02:03:54,580 --> 02:03:57,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not try to limit my bandwidth and lower my ping times.

1781
02:03:58,161 --> 02:04:03,944
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was accusations that Rogers was apparently throttling the bandwidth and so forth.

1782
02:04:04,624 --> 02:04:14,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Rogers has admitted that the game's online traffic might actually trip the monitors that kind of monitor this stuff and result in throttling.

1783
02:04:14,488 --> 02:04:19,230
[SPEAKER_10]: They are calling this inadvertent, but that doesn't fix the problem.

1784
02:04:20,011 --> 02:04:22,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess Canadian regulators have even gotten involved.

1785
02:04:22,672 --> 02:04:25,853
[SPEAKER_10]: The Canadian Gamers Organization, I didn't even know that existed.

1786
02:04:25,893 --> 02:04:26,493
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of cool.

1787
02:04:26,833 --> 02:04:30,175
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually filed an inquiry into the practices of this company.

1788
02:04:31,176 --> 02:04:39,863
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess what happens is because you've got the peer-to-peer traffic going on in World of Warcraft, it's being misclassified as something more nefarious.

1789
02:04:40,184 --> 02:04:43,246
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, the same thing apparently is happening in Call of Duty Black Ops.

1790
02:04:43,967 --> 02:04:51,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the rule is that if something is transmitting 80k BPS or more, it is what is enabling the throttling.

1791
02:04:53,075 --> 02:04:58,259
[SPEAKER_10]: So, now Rogers says that the games can all run underneath that rate.

1792
02:04:58,599 --> 02:05:03,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So, those who are experiencing the throttling must be running some type of other application with the gaming.

1793
02:05:03,623 --> 02:05:07,005
[SPEAKER_10]: But I kind of sit there and go, well, what about like Ventrilo and some of the other stuff?

1794
02:05:07,025 --> 02:05:11,448
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm notorious for playing WoW and surfing the web at the same time.

1795
02:05:11,949 --> 02:05:15,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Just put a renew on somebody and then, you know, go alt tab and check my email.

1796
02:05:15,972 --> 02:05:16,672
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

1797
02:05:17,953 --> 02:05:19,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let's see.

1798
02:05:20,454 --> 02:05:42,567
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the co-founder of the Canadian Gamer Organization said, "...rather than fixing the issue and actively whitelisting gaming systems to ensure they are not affected, Rogers is continuing to rely on consumer input and complaints rather than put forth the active testing needed to ensure compliance with CRTC policy.

1799
02:05:42,967 --> 02:05:46,469
[SPEAKER_10]: We believe this approach is inappropriate under these circumstances."

1800
02:05:46,969 --> 02:05:55,737
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Canadian Gamers Organization is going to ask for a new law requiring providers like Rogers to have a formal way for customers to report complaints.

1801
02:05:56,358 --> 02:06:00,201
[SPEAKER_10]: So Canadians are pissed and you don't hear that very often.

1802
02:06:00,842 --> 02:06:01,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1803
02:06:02,243 --> 02:06:05,206
[SPEAKER_07]: So now, honestly, I think I would be, too.

1804
02:06:06,467 --> 02:06:06,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1805
02:06:06,747 --> 02:06:08,128
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't get between somebody in there.

1806
02:06:08,148 --> 02:06:08,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1807
02:06:08,428 --> 02:06:09,009
[SPEAKER_10]: You just don't.

1808
02:06:09,049 --> 02:06:09,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1809
02:06:09,569 --> 02:06:10,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Call of Duty.

1810
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:11,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Those people, you know.

1811
02:06:12,613 --> 02:06:17,116
[SPEAKER_10]: The shitty thing is that it is legitimate use of the internet and it's being throttled.

1812
02:06:17,316 --> 02:06:25,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand why they want to throttle bandwidth and so forth, but unfortunately, legit people pay the cost.

1813
02:06:25,562 --> 02:06:26,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody else.

1814
02:06:28,164 --> 02:06:29,665
[SPEAKER_10]: All the time, the common thing.

1815
02:06:29,765 --> 02:06:32,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Same thing we've said about DRM time and time again.

1816
02:06:33,748 --> 02:06:34,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to the emails.

1817
02:06:35,635 --> 02:06:43,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelaundry.com DarkSakura's gonna dive into the email bag and pull out a few of her favorite emails.

1818
02:06:43,683 --> 02:06:44,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Ew, it's so sticky!

1819
02:06:46,164 --> 02:06:46,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, the first one.

1820
02:06:47,384 --> 02:06:51,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi all, just wanted to point out that you could actually surf the net on the DS.

1821
02:06:51,605 --> 02:06:53,725
[SPEAKER_07]: They just didn't release the attachments in the USA.

1822
02:06:53,845 --> 02:06:57,686
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was in Japan, I bought it and it was one of the ones that used the GBA slot in a different way.

1823
02:06:58,366 --> 02:07:03,407
[SPEAKER_07]: As for the 3DS versus Vita, well, I just got a 3DS.

1824
02:07:03,447 --> 02:07:04,667
[SPEAKER_07]: The PSP never appealed to me.

1825
02:07:04,767 --> 02:07:05,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the 3DS.

1826
02:07:06,308 --> 02:07:13,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I did buy mine on eBay for $195 with 3DS games included and the Nintendo Ambassador program.

1827
02:07:13,729 --> 02:07:19,673
[SPEAKER_07]: with the Vita, and by the way, it's V-I-T-A, not D-A.

1828
02:07:21,754 --> 02:07:27,118
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have to pull off something really impressive because Netflix on my 3DS is awesome.

1829
02:07:27,498 --> 02:07:31,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Not going to buy another system if the one I have now can do it already, and that's from Holly D.

1830
02:07:33,422 --> 02:07:34,342
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, that is correct.

1831
02:07:34,362 --> 02:07:41,826
[SPEAKER_10]: I could have sworn we would have made that clear, because I was aware that the DS had a web browser, but only on the DSs that had the eShop.

1832
02:07:42,266 --> 02:07:44,967
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would start with the DSi and above.

1833
02:07:45,267 --> 02:07:49,549
[SPEAKER_10]: However, but I do remember what I did forget, that Japan did have a cart.

1834
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:52,451
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually, I found one for sale at the local dimple.

1835
02:07:52,771 --> 02:07:54,332
[SPEAKER_09]: The US also had a cartridge.

1836
02:07:54,352 --> 02:07:54,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they really?

1837
02:07:55,092 --> 02:07:55,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1838
02:07:55,573 --> 02:07:56,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know that.

1839
02:07:56,573 --> 02:07:58,534
[SPEAKER_09]: It came with a memory expansion slot.

1840
02:07:58,855 --> 02:08:00,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Or a memory expansion that goes in the Game Boy Advance slot.

1841
02:08:00,916 --> 02:08:03,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I did forget about the browser and the cartridge.

1842
02:08:03,377 --> 02:08:04,758
[SPEAKER_10]: But still terrible.

1843
02:08:04,878 --> 02:08:07,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like browsing the web on the 3DS either.

1844
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:08,620
[SPEAKER_10]: It is terrible.

1845
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:09,261
[SPEAKER_10]: It's clunky.

1846
02:08:09,301 --> 02:08:09,621
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1847
02:08:09,901 --> 02:08:11,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, moving forward.

1848
02:08:11,382 --> 02:08:12,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Needs to be optimized.

1849
02:08:12,362 --> 02:08:12,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1850
02:08:13,583 --> 02:08:13,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Evening.

1851
02:08:14,304 --> 02:08:18,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have sent this last week, but didn't realize you had a Labor Day weekend show.

1852
02:08:18,686 --> 02:08:21,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, I see the mobile game Flight Control is now available for WiiWare.

1853
02:08:22,388 --> 02:08:28,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Fairly nice to have this one on a full display with local multiplayer, although the lack of verses is somewhat disappointing.

1854
02:08:28,792 --> 02:08:32,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, it really puts the infamous Wii Remote jitter...

1855
02:08:34,375 --> 02:08:35,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Jitterfront and Center.

1856
02:08:35,936 --> 02:08:36,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1857
02:08:36,896 --> 02:08:40,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe last year FireMint was supposed to have a PS Move version of the game.

1858
02:08:40,897 --> 02:08:42,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they say why this never came out in North America?

1859
02:08:43,038 --> 02:08:46,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's from Robert M. No, and I gotta admit, I'm not very familiar with that game.

1860
02:08:46,559 --> 02:08:47,299
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it called again?

1861
02:08:47,379 --> 02:08:48,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Flight Control?

1862
02:08:48,859 --> 02:08:49,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1863
02:08:49,639 --> 02:08:51,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, is this a game you know about?

1864
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:59,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Flight Control is one of those air traffic controller games where you control the different planes that are taking off and stuff.

1865
02:08:59,502 --> 02:09:01,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they have that kind of stuff on the iPod.

1866
02:09:01,063 --> 02:09:02,223
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have been a WiiWare game.

1867
02:09:02,583 --> 02:09:04,104
[SPEAKER_07]: It said it was originally a mobile game.

1868
02:09:05,205 --> 02:09:07,787
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at a trailer here for the game.

1869
02:09:08,628 --> 02:09:11,210
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so visual I need to see this here.

1870
02:09:14,473 --> 02:09:14,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh!

1871
02:09:15,233 --> 02:09:15,594
[SPEAKER_10]: See?

1872
02:09:15,774 --> 02:09:18,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Once I see it, this is based on an iPad game.

1873
02:09:19,537 --> 02:09:23,880
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where you draw the path of the planes and you don't want them to collide.

1874
02:09:24,181 --> 02:09:25,322
[SPEAKER_10]: This is based off an iPad game.

1875
02:09:27,677 --> 02:09:28,558
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I just had to see it.

1876
02:09:29,058 --> 02:09:29,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I do know this game.

1877
02:09:30,839 --> 02:09:33,521
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that they had ported it to anything besides the iPad.

1878
02:09:33,561 --> 02:09:34,522
[SPEAKER_10]: That part's news to me.

1879
02:09:37,324 --> 02:09:37,844
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

1880
02:09:38,105 --> 02:09:41,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I don't know the other answer to your question.

1881
02:09:41,607 --> 02:09:42,007
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1882
02:09:42,568 --> 02:09:45,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you're going to need to pull up this email because apparently there's a YouTube link.

1883
02:09:45,029 --> 02:09:46,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to copy it to you.

1884
02:09:46,851 --> 02:09:48,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just copy the YouTube link to me.

1885
02:09:48,432 --> 02:09:52,635
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will read you the... Let me just paste it to you real quick.

1886
02:09:52,655 --> 02:09:52,735
Sure.

1887
02:09:55,029 --> 02:09:57,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Live Radio Kids, that's what we're all about here.

1888
02:09:57,550 --> 02:09:58,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm fast.

1889
02:09:59,110 --> 02:10:00,131
[SPEAKER_07]: With my damn trackball.

1890
02:10:00,551 --> 02:10:01,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I play it now or when you say?

1891
02:10:02,652 --> 02:10:04,512
[SPEAKER_07]: After this, I'll go ahead and read this.

1892
02:10:04,933 --> 02:10:06,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo homies, Xenocore here.

1893
02:10:07,353 --> 02:10:11,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sad that I just discovered this song, but you must use this for Listless this Sunday.

1894
02:10:12,195 --> 02:10:12,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

1895
02:10:13,776 --> 02:10:15,856
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from the Rubber Bandits, Horse Outside.

1896
02:10:16,297 --> 02:10:18,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't use the clean version, this song is freaking awesome.

1897
02:10:18,777 --> 02:10:20,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're talking about Cage Match.

1898
02:10:20,838 --> 02:10:22,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, it's probably Cage Match.

1899
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:24,020
[SPEAKER_07]: But, hey.

1900
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:24,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Dudes with accents.

1901
02:10:24,701 --> 02:10:26,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me forward a little bit here.

1902
02:10:26,282 --> 02:10:29,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think this is something for the Cage Match segment, not the... Veto!

1903
02:10:29,324 --> 02:10:29,564
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

1904
02:10:29,584 --> 02:10:30,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check it out later.

1905
02:10:30,845 --> 02:10:31,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Veto.

1906
02:10:31,025 --> 02:10:32,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Not when we're live on air.

1907
02:10:50,250 --> 02:10:50,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's it.

1908
02:10:51,171 --> 02:10:51,571
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it?

1909
02:10:51,891 --> 02:10:52,212
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1910
02:10:52,292 --> 02:10:53,072
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more emails.

1911
02:10:53,112 --> 02:10:57,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the other one was someone trying to get us to, like, post his stuff, and I'm like, no.

1912
02:10:57,636 --> 02:10:59,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com.

1913
02:10:59,758 --> 02:11:00,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Free plugs.

1914
02:11:01,619 --> 02:11:02,600
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to disguise your free plugs.

1915
02:11:02,640 --> 02:11:03,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not free.

1916
02:11:03,561 --> 02:11:03,801
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1917
02:11:05,503 --> 02:11:05,823
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1918
02:11:06,143 --> 02:11:09,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to the part of the show where we... It costs a lot of money to be this cheap.

1919
02:11:10,467 --> 02:11:12,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to the part of the show where we get ranty.

1920
02:11:12,949 --> 02:11:16,492
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the FUs of the week, and we do them here on the show because we can.

1921
02:11:32,962 --> 02:11:36,005
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to finding out about emo crap during the show.

1922
02:11:37,046 --> 02:11:37,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Puh.

1923
02:11:39,008 --> 02:11:39,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1924
02:11:39,889 --> 02:11:41,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you, my cat, for being an asshole.

1925
02:11:43,946 --> 02:11:45,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I don't know.

1926
02:11:45,767 --> 02:11:47,829
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to the fact that this weekend was shorter than last week.

1927
02:11:47,889 --> 02:11:50,150
[SPEAKER_10]: No, F you to the three hour nap I took yesterday.

1928
02:11:50,451 --> 02:11:54,493
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the first weekend in forever where I had literally nothing planned on Saturday.

1929
02:11:54,553 --> 02:11:57,075
[SPEAKER_10]: It was amazing to just sit at home all day and veg.

1930
02:11:57,515 --> 02:11:58,156
[SPEAKER_10]: But what did I do?

1931
02:11:58,256 --> 02:12:00,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I napped literally the whole damn day away.

1932
02:12:01,078 --> 02:12:02,759
[SPEAKER_10]: But I feel really rested and I feel great.

1933
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:04,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I guess I needed it.

1934
02:12:05,781 --> 02:12:07,422
[SPEAKER_10]: But F you to what felt like a wasted day.

1935
02:12:08,803 --> 02:12:16,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, a few more news stories for you guys, then we're going to open it up to you guys via Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1936
02:12:16,974 --> 02:12:19,277
[SPEAKER_10]: But don't call yet, because we still have a few more stories to get through.

1937
02:12:20,218 --> 02:12:21,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Origin has been doing pretty well.

1938
02:12:22,241 --> 02:12:23,242
[SPEAKER_09]: EA's new...

1939
02:12:25,305 --> 02:12:25,686
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1940
02:12:42,846 --> 02:12:45,608
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be adding third-party content very soon.

1941
02:12:46,569 --> 02:12:57,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, they're saying that it will use its collection of 130 million users and various payment methods to attract third-party games to Origin.

1942
02:12:59,079 --> 02:13:00,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So, wait a second.

1943
02:13:01,421 --> 02:13:05,724
[SPEAKER_09]: So what they're saying is they have 4 million client installs, yet 130 million users?

1944
02:13:05,744 --> 02:13:05,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1945
02:13:09,056 --> 02:13:10,197
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't really make sense to me.

1946
02:13:11,577 --> 02:13:11,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1947
02:13:12,418 --> 02:13:16,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they're talking about maybe their electronic arts site.

1948
02:13:16,139 --> 02:13:24,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, like when you do Dragon Age and stuff, you have to sign up for their stupid online thing.

1949
02:13:24,203 --> 02:13:26,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I like how they count all those players in there.

1950
02:13:27,064 --> 02:13:28,265
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have a choice.

1951
02:13:28,365 --> 02:13:31,866
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to sign up on that site in order to play those games.

1952
02:13:31,926 --> 02:13:34,348
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like, oh, I love EA.

1953
02:13:34,508 --> 02:13:37,289
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to totally register an account with them because...

1954
02:13:38,001 --> 02:13:42,682
[SPEAKER_09]: They're awesome, and I love their products, and you have no choice.

1955
02:13:43,562 --> 02:13:44,722
[SPEAKER_09]: But I like how they skew that.

1956
02:13:44,942 --> 02:13:45,542
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

1957
02:13:47,063 --> 02:13:57,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, there's some information from Origin regarding a new remake of Syndicate, that series.

1958
02:13:58,085 --> 02:14:04,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, it's going to be done by the developer Starbreeze, who did Escape from Butcher Bay and The Darkness.

1959
02:14:06,968 --> 02:14:09,211
[SPEAKER_09]: and I guess they're showing off some stuff.

1960
02:14:11,553 --> 02:14:13,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Some stuff, I guess, leaked out from their website.

1961
02:14:13,875 --> 02:14:15,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks interesting.

1962
02:14:15,276 --> 02:14:19,459
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying the story's penned by the guy that did the Crisis 2 script.

1963
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:22,382
[SPEAKER_09]: And he also wrote some books and stuff.

1964
02:14:22,922 --> 02:14:29,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, that it's supposed to debut next week in the Game Reactor magazine, which is a Swedish publication.

1965
02:14:30,949 --> 02:14:33,571
[SPEAKER_09]: And, I don't know, it looks kind of cool.

1966
02:14:33,891 --> 02:14:36,033
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I guess...

1967
02:14:37,881 --> 02:14:44,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Check out the EA Origins store if you want to catch some details on that or just check out the web because it's leaked out.

1968
02:14:47,346 --> 02:14:47,706
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1969
02:14:48,787 --> 02:14:52,929
[SPEAKER_10]: I have yet to use the Origins store, but I remember we got a call last week saying it's not that bad, you guys.

1970
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:59,072
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is interesting that it has so many installs, but isn't that because it's kind of forced on people?

1971
02:14:59,913 --> 02:15:00,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1972
02:15:00,407 --> 02:15:03,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Origin, I mean, some of it's probably voluntary.

1973
02:15:03,531 --> 02:15:10,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it was, didn't it become Origin like it was something else and then it just translated over to Origin?

1974
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:18,209
[SPEAKER_10]: God, whenever, well, whenever I hear Origin, I think about the old school publishing house or studio that would make games, like the old Ultimate games were all Origin.

1975
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:19,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that's what this is.

1976
02:15:19,591 --> 02:15:20,552
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no, no.

1977
02:15:20,612 --> 02:15:21,593
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Steam.

1978
02:15:21,814 --> 02:15:22,535
[SPEAKER_10]: This is their Steam.

1979
02:15:22,895 --> 02:15:27,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I understand that, but Origin was that company, and now it's the site.

1980
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:31,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, EA sucked them up and then never used the name, and now they just brought back the name for this.

1981
02:15:31,465 --> 02:15:34,148
[SPEAKER_10]: But the two uses of the name have nothing to do with each other.

1982
02:15:35,269 --> 02:15:35,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

1983
02:15:36,370 --> 02:15:37,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, it makes sense.

1984
02:15:39,133 --> 02:15:44,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, Wii U, this has been some big news talking about this week.

1985
02:15:45,137 --> 02:15:53,661
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, while this reeks of being a rumor, this is coming from that French site that's been getting a lot of smoking guns lately.

1986
02:15:53,862 --> 02:16:00,365
[SPEAKER_10]: They've become quite the site to get the early gossip because they leaked the news about the Vita, right?

1987
02:16:00,505 --> 02:16:00,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I think.

1988
02:16:01,206 --> 02:16:04,988
[SPEAKER_10]: They leaked the news about the extra thing on the 3DS, which now we have a picture of.

1989
02:16:05,388 --> 02:16:06,709
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they're talking about this.

1990
02:16:06,809 --> 02:16:17,779
[SPEAKER_10]: This, so take it with a grain of salt, but it's very interesting regarding the Wii U. Apparently, they're saying that Nintendo is having big problems getting the Wii U up and running.

1991
02:16:18,220 --> 02:16:22,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, the Wii U is not up to wanting to do what Nintendo needs it to do.

1992
02:16:22,904 --> 02:16:28,008
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just running the console, but beaming the data to the touchscreen controller as well.

1993
02:16:28,028 --> 02:16:31,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, developers that are working on the console, they use tethers,

1994
02:16:32,012 --> 02:16:37,255
[SPEAKER_10]: To ensure that the communication, so basically it has to do with the wireless aspect of it.

1995
02:16:37,535 --> 02:16:42,938
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now the developers have to use a wire to the controller to make sure the information gets across fast enough.

1996
02:16:43,959 --> 02:16:46,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Even then, apparently things aren't still working out that well.

1997
02:16:47,181 --> 02:16:51,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Progress is halted daily with repeated software updates for the pad.

1998
02:16:52,143 --> 02:16:53,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm, interesting.

1999
02:16:53,785 --> 02:16:58,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, apparently these problems are causing a delay in the console's launch.

2000
02:16:58,472 --> 02:17:02,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Originally, they had been looking at June 2012, but now they're saying September 2012, which to me...

2001
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:08,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally, I would have said, well, that was the time frame I was thinking for the system anyway.

2002
02:17:08,774 --> 02:17:11,116
[SPEAKER_10]: So that doesn't seem like such a huge setback.

2003
02:17:11,736 --> 02:17:14,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, obviously, you can't prove these allegations.

2004
02:17:14,919 --> 02:17:19,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo, even though the blogs are trying to get them to comment, they're not going to.

2005
02:17:19,203 --> 02:17:21,165
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to say, we don't comment on rumors and speculation.

2006
02:17:21,505 --> 02:17:27,551
[SPEAKER_10]: But it definitely kind of says, hmm, maybe this is not going to be ready by the time it needs to be.

2007
02:17:27,551 --> 02:17:28,071
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to say.

2008
02:17:28,171 --> 02:17:28,952
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not good.

2009
02:17:28,972 --> 02:17:29,432
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't know...

2010
02:17:52,102 --> 02:17:55,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't know if it's really going to end up being true.

2011
02:17:55,145 --> 02:17:59,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, they're not going to launch the system if it's not going to work.

2012
02:17:59,829 --> 02:18:01,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if flat doesn't work, they're not going to launch it.

2013
02:18:02,051 --> 02:18:06,135
[SPEAKER_10]: But might they have to downgrade it a little bit to get it to work?

2014
02:18:06,395 --> 02:18:08,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Or I guess it could go the other way around.

2015
02:18:08,477 --> 02:18:10,378
[SPEAKER_10]: They'd have to upgrade it to get it to work too, huh?

2016
02:18:10,418 --> 02:18:11,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure which way it goes.

2017
02:18:11,980 --> 02:18:16,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you downgrade the processing power so that way there's not as much data to transmit?

2018
02:18:16,444 --> 02:18:17,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do you upgrade?

2019
02:18:18,245 --> 02:18:19,967
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's finding the balance.

2020
02:18:20,467 --> 02:18:36,694
[SPEAKER_10]: but it is interesting that the PlayStation 3 kind of does this with the PSP right now it's a little lag though I mean it wouldn't the technology has to get a little bit better than that I don't know how it's going to work with the PS3 and the Vita but you know it's a little bit laggy and obviously they don't want that on the Wii U

2021
02:18:37,523 --> 02:18:41,027
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm wondering, though, what it uses.

2022
02:18:42,148 --> 02:18:45,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was just looking this up.

2023
02:18:45,311 --> 02:18:46,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a theory here.

2024
02:18:46,413 --> 02:18:54,381
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why we may be seeing the whole 3DS getting a second analog stick is maybe they're just not going to put out the controller at all.

2025
02:18:55,541 --> 02:18:56,061
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2026
02:19:16,584 --> 02:19:16,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe?

2027
02:19:16,844 --> 02:19:17,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2028
02:19:17,625 --> 02:19:19,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting comment from Imaginomicon in chat.

2029
02:19:20,046 --> 02:19:22,907
[SPEAKER_10]: In all fairness, Kinect had basically the same situation.

2030
02:19:23,007 --> 02:19:27,309
[SPEAKER_10]: That is, it couldn't do what they initially advertised and was eventually gimped.

2031
02:19:27,709 --> 02:19:32,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Weren't there early rumors about the Kinect that the Kinect couldn't see certain races and things like that?

2032
02:19:32,472 --> 02:19:34,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's not true, though.

2033
02:19:35,413 --> 02:19:39,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that was just bad PR for Microsoft.

2034
02:19:39,075 --> 02:19:40,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it can't see black people.

2035
02:19:40,596 --> 02:19:41,496
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's not true.

2036
02:19:42,048 --> 02:19:44,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, obviously I can now, but, you know.

2037
02:19:44,431 --> 02:19:45,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it could before.

2038
02:19:45,773 --> 02:19:50,318
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just like if you're playing on, you know, it depends on where you're playing.

2039
02:19:50,338 --> 02:19:53,162
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're playing with something with a lot of light interference or, you know, if it's...

2040
02:19:54,794 --> 02:19:58,236
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't play Connect in the Dark either.

2041
02:19:58,296 --> 02:20:01,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you gotta have some, you know, some light.

2042
02:20:01,618 --> 02:20:09,342
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it was stupid because it was like, well, actually, it won't detect anybody in those lighting conditions and not necessarily just people of a certain race.

2043
02:20:09,462 --> 02:20:11,724
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, that was just...

2044
02:20:12,324 --> 02:20:29,330
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do seem to recall that it seemed like the Kinect... I want to say there was a story about how they did have to kind of change the Kinect too, so... Well, I think they dropped the resolution down so they could have more bandwidth to go between the sensor and the system, but...

2045
02:20:31,019 --> 02:20:31,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

2046
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:51,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand why it's not possible.

2047
02:20:51,642 --> 02:20:58,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can do it on the PSP, but you can do it on the PSP over the internet and over that 802.11g.

2048
02:20:59,086 --> 02:21:07,872
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe, like I said before, more bandwidth there and allow you to be able to do what you can't do on the console.

2049
02:21:07,912 --> 02:21:11,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, why couldn't you make the controller connect to your Wi-Fi network?

2050
02:21:12,255 --> 02:21:13,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, then you can even add it.

2051
02:21:13,576 --> 02:21:18,800
[SPEAKER_09]: So, hey, look, you can surf the web on this controller, but it's not going to let you do that.

2052
02:21:20,140 --> 02:21:24,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well let's move on with a few more stories before we get to the Twitter topics and phone calls.

2053
02:21:24,182 --> 02:21:27,544
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm expecting to hear about this and some phone calls tonight.

2054
02:21:27,964 --> 02:21:28,785
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, next story.

2055
02:21:29,845 --> 02:21:33,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about the scariest Xbox 360 game?

2056
02:21:33,567 --> 02:21:34,407
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think it would be?

2057
02:21:36,588 --> 02:21:38,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Scariest Xbox 360 game?

2058
02:21:39,330 --> 02:21:39,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2059
02:21:40,865 --> 02:21:45,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it looks that the major vote goes for Dead Space 2.

2060
02:21:45,248 --> 02:21:50,151
[SPEAKER_07]: That that is considered to be the scariest game.

2061
02:21:51,111 --> 02:22:06,121
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is coming just ahead of what they did is they actually tested core and casual gamers' heart rate, sweat levels, and body temperature while playing Alan Wake, Resident Evil 5, Dead Space 2, and Condemned.

2062
02:22:06,201 --> 02:22:08,242
[SPEAKER_09]: It was sad that Yaris wasn't included in there.

2063
02:22:10,099 --> 02:22:12,781
[SPEAKER_07]: That would have been nausea-inducing, not scary.

2064
02:22:13,881 --> 02:22:14,941
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Connectimals?

2065
02:22:15,001 --> 02:22:16,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of those fuckers are pretty frightening.

2066
02:22:16,782 --> 02:22:23,265
[SPEAKER_07]: They said that core gamers dealt better with the scares than the apparently wussy casual players.

2067
02:22:23,925 --> 02:22:28,787
[SPEAKER_07]: But they all experienced rapidly increased heart rate, stunted breathing, and a rise in skin temperature.

2068
02:22:30,608 --> 02:22:30,768
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

2069
02:22:33,502 --> 02:22:37,103
[SPEAKER_07]: There were pretty vocal about some of it too.

2070
02:22:37,223 --> 02:22:40,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Like one of them started screaming, oh my god, oh my god, this shit is so scary.

2071
02:22:40,264 --> 02:22:45,125
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like Shane when they're playing Silent Hill or something.

2072
02:22:45,865 --> 02:22:55,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Other games that were considered but not found scary enough were Left 4 Dead 2, Gears of War 2, Condemned 2, Fear 1 and 2, Dead Space 1, and Silent Hill Homecoming, Alone in the Dark, and Mass Effect 2.

2073
02:22:58,318 --> 02:23:26,040
[SPEAKER_10]: I told you about how Silent Hill Homecoming made me basically scream like a little girl and go shut the front door that had blown open from the wind and oh my god that was a horrible night hearts like who sits at home alone in the dark and plays Silent Hill you're just asking for it remember when Miklatov was visiting a while back and played through Silent Hill 2 and we were all curled up in your living room like on the couch in the dark watching him play I don't think I was in there

2074
02:23:26,977 --> 02:23:27,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, you weren't.

2075
02:23:27,918 --> 02:23:28,498
[SPEAKER_07]: You weren't there.

2076
02:23:28,638 --> 02:23:36,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there, and it was like, I think Irene was there, and Eddie, I think Eddie was there.

2077
02:23:37,382 --> 02:23:38,143
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it was pretty funny.

2078
02:23:39,483 --> 02:23:42,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Christopher was there, because it was when you were living with Christopher.

2079
02:23:42,965 --> 02:23:44,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, no, I probably just was out.

2080
02:23:44,926 --> 02:23:45,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you were gone.

2081
02:23:46,567 --> 02:23:51,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I was probably on a hot date while you nerds were playing Silent Hill.

2082
02:23:52,310 --> 02:23:53,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that shit was awesome.

2083
02:23:53,590 --> 02:23:54,771
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Loki.

2084
02:23:56,116 --> 02:24:02,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so of course, you know, one of the pioneers of Project $10 was EA.

2085
02:24:03,023 --> 02:24:09,589
[SPEAKER_09]: And EA's been doing this for a while now, since June of last year, starting with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.

2086
02:24:10,570 --> 02:24:20,039
[SPEAKER_09]: They were including basically a voucher in their new games that allowed you to get, you know, online access, their online pass, if you will.

2087
02:24:20,899 --> 02:24:29,023
[SPEAKER_09]: and if you bought the game used, well, that might not be in there and so you would have to pay $10 to be able to play online.

2088
02:24:29,143 --> 02:24:34,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, EA has come out and said that they have made between $10 and $15 million from online pass and

2089
02:24:41,569 --> 02:24:52,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently the revenues they said that they derived from that haven't been dramatic since they initiated the program, but it's not a failure at all.

2090
02:24:53,077 --> 02:24:57,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you consider that, that's spread across quite a few games.

2091
02:24:58,201 --> 02:25:03,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Woods, NCAA football, both years for NCAA football and Madden.

2092
02:25:03,705 --> 02:25:04,946
[SPEAKER_10]: EA does a lot of sports games.

2093
02:25:05,066 --> 02:25:05,867
[SPEAKER_09]: EA, MMA...

2094
02:25:09,167 --> 02:25:09,788
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2095
02:25:33,809 --> 02:26:01,313
[SPEAKER_09]: and really they only have to that's you know 1 million about 1 million people that have bought into this so split that across you know over 5 games or whatever that's you know quite a significant amount I guess but 200,000 per title you know split across platforms and stuff wow they you know despite what do you want to call the number big or small or whatever EA made money appear out of nowhere

2096
02:26:02,461 --> 02:26:03,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, good for them.

2097
02:26:03,482 --> 02:26:04,402
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not deserving.

2098
02:26:04,562 --> 02:26:11,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that they need that money because, once again, their complaint was, oh, well, those people that buy the game used.

2099
02:26:11,706 --> 02:26:14,768
[SPEAKER_10]: The tax breaks they're getting from the government just aren't enough.

2100
02:26:14,848 --> 02:26:16,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you read about that this week?

2101
02:26:16,428 --> 02:26:17,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, I read about that.

2102
02:26:17,789 --> 02:26:26,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and their excuse, well, those people that are buying used, we can't support the online if they're buying the game used because we don't see any of their revenue.

2103
02:26:28,012 --> 02:26:37,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's a nice way to spin it except for the fact that the person that first bought that game brand new already paid you that money to keep up your network.

2104
02:26:38,604 --> 02:26:39,646
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too damn bad.

2105
02:26:40,406 --> 02:26:40,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Suck it up.

2106
02:26:41,968 --> 02:26:42,609
[SPEAKER_09]: You're EA.

2107
02:26:43,009 --> 02:26:43,850
[SPEAKER_09]: You can survive.

2108
02:26:45,580 --> 02:26:46,501
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2109
02:27:09,978 --> 02:27:11,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, but this is a game.

2110
02:27:12,739 --> 02:27:14,180
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a free-to-download game.

2111
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:17,461
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in beta right now, and it's a game called Oniken.

2112
02:27:18,361 --> 02:27:25,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Oniken is, I guess, a tribute to challenging 8-bit action games from the NES.

2113
02:27:26,364 --> 02:27:38,068
[SPEAKER_10]: They say that the game is actually NES hard, and there's a little clip here I'm going to play in studio, and I think DarkSakura would be into this because it looks a bit like the guy's weapon he's using is very Strider-esque.

2114
02:27:39,813 --> 02:27:42,374
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, once again, this is not like a NES ROM.

2115
02:27:42,654 --> 02:27:43,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, it does look like a Cypher.

2116
02:27:44,876 --> 02:27:45,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't it?

2117
02:27:45,776 --> 02:27:51,559
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually designed to be a game on the PC that is just NES tribute, NES style hard.

2118
02:27:51,619 --> 02:27:54,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that means like, we're talking La Mulana or what.

2119
02:27:55,221 --> 02:27:57,282
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Bionic Commando.

2120
02:27:57,982 --> 02:27:59,043
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not to me.

2121
02:27:59,623 --> 02:28:00,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, like the backgrounds.

2122
02:28:01,164 --> 02:28:03,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, the artwork is very Bionic Commando.

2123
02:28:03,465 --> 02:28:04,426
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about the gameplay.

2124
02:28:04,446 --> 02:28:05,586
[SPEAKER_10]: No, nothing like it though. ...

2125
02:28:08,968 --> 02:28:09,969
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks really fun though.

2126
02:28:11,972 --> 02:28:13,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Fast forward to some of these other levels.

2127
02:28:14,035 --> 02:28:18,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that almost looks like a rip of the Ninja Gaiden sprite from the original game.

2128
02:28:18,921 --> 02:28:20,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they just switched it up a little bit.

2129
02:28:20,944 --> 02:28:23,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Like even his stance and the way he moves and stuff like that.

2130
02:28:23,848 --> 02:28:24,589
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit, huh?

2131
02:28:25,029 --> 02:28:28,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently what's available right now to play, three missions in the game.

2132
02:28:29,950 --> 02:28:33,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Oniken, again is the name of the game, O-N-I-K-E-N.

2133
02:28:34,371 --> 02:28:37,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of good visuals and so forth.

2134
02:28:37,092 --> 02:28:45,534
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to check it out for yourself, oniken.net, H-T-T-P, colon slash slash, www.oniken.net.

2135
02:28:45,614 --> 02:28:48,075
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will go ahead and paste that in chat for the live listeners.

2136
02:28:48,155 --> 02:28:50,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Those of you on the podcast, I hope you were writing quickly.

2137
02:28:51,736 --> 02:28:55,959
[SPEAKER_10]: or maybe I can get DarkSakura to Tumblr at least the video there so you guys can check that out.

2138
02:28:56,680 --> 02:28:57,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you link it?

2139
02:28:57,641 --> 02:28:58,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there it is.

2140
02:28:58,181 --> 02:28:58,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2141
02:28:58,541 --> 02:29:00,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll put it on the thing.

2142
02:29:00,883 --> 02:29:01,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

2143
02:29:02,344 --> 02:29:02,984
[SPEAKER_10]: That was kind of fun.

2144
02:29:03,185 --> 02:29:03,905
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to check that out.

2145
02:29:05,266 --> 02:29:06,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Big Brother Blade?

2146
02:29:06,407 --> 02:29:07,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the fact that it's free.

2147
02:29:07,588 --> 02:29:08,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Ogre Blade?

2148
02:29:09,229 --> 02:29:09,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe?

2149
02:29:10,330 --> 02:29:10,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Ogre Blade?

2150
02:29:11,651 --> 02:29:12,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Free is my favorite word.

2151
02:29:13,812 --> 02:29:14,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

2152
02:29:15,694 --> 02:29:18,175
[SPEAKER_10]: How about we open up the phone line and take some of your calls right now?

2153
02:29:18,195 --> 02:29:21,477
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Speaking of free, you can call us free on that line.

2154
02:29:21,897 --> 02:29:24,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2155
02:29:24,638 --> 02:29:31,782
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight or if you have something gaming related that we haven't quite got to yet, we will talk about that as well.

2156
02:29:32,302 --> 02:29:37,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Meanwhile, we're going to fire up the Twitter and get to some of your tweets this week at twitter.com.

2157
02:29:39,667 --> 02:29:40,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to the tweets real quick.

2158
02:29:41,308 --> 02:29:42,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Jvmon sent us a tweet tonight.

2159
02:29:43,129 --> 02:29:45,531
[SPEAKER_10]: When did WoW, Warcraft, get so fun?

2160
02:29:45,972 --> 02:29:47,153
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't stop playing.

2161
02:29:47,473 --> 02:29:48,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I blame you.

2162
02:29:48,254 --> 02:29:48,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Hugs and kisses.

2163
02:29:49,995 --> 02:29:50,896
[SPEAKER_07]: When Cataclysm hit.

2164
02:29:51,716 --> 02:29:58,442
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so interesting because to a lot of the hardcore, so to speak, Cataclysm was not so well received.

2165
02:29:58,942 --> 02:29:59,963
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very interesting.

2166
02:30:00,263 --> 02:30:05,668
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the changing of the level 1 to 60 areas, though, is great for those that weren't quite yet into WoW.

2167
02:30:06,337 --> 02:30:08,538
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think that was kind of cool, I guess.

2168
02:30:10,018 --> 02:30:12,059
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, Cataclysm hasn't been all bad news.

2169
02:30:12,119 --> 02:30:18,021
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just I think the early game is much more improved than the end game was, if that makes sense.

2170
02:30:18,721 --> 02:30:20,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, we got calls coming in, so let's go to it.

2171
02:30:20,602 --> 02:30:21,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2172
02:30:21,662 --> 02:30:22,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2173
02:30:22,683 --> 02:30:23,843
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one and only Ranma.

2174
02:30:24,003 --> 02:30:24,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma.

2175
02:30:24,443 --> 02:30:25,083
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2176
02:30:26,164 --> 02:30:29,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, last week's podcast.

2177
02:30:29,065 --> 02:30:30,285
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's on my mind tonight.

2178
02:30:30,745 --> 02:30:31,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is that?

2179
02:30:31,406 --> 02:30:32,226
[SPEAKER_10]: It was long, wasn't it?

2180
02:30:33,140 --> 02:30:41,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, it was long, and that was the first time in history I've had to listen to it again just to absorb all that...

2181
02:30:43,936 --> 02:30:45,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Big G Bullshit

2182
02:31:14,321 --> 02:31:19,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I strongly believe that Square Enix didn't do anything wrong.

2183
02:31:20,049 --> 02:31:24,376
[SPEAKER_04]: The big G is just butt hurt and they're blowing smoke up people's asses.

2184
02:31:25,825 --> 02:31:26,285
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2185
02:31:26,646 --> 02:31:31,009
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think it was in bad form for Squeenix to spring that on people.

2186
02:31:31,469 --> 02:31:36,653
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think GameStop had the right to know what was in that box and choose not to sell it.

2187
02:31:37,074 --> 02:31:46,921
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I said, I don't want to repeat myself from last week, but as I said, the correct answer was what they finally did too late was just push the game back to Squeenix and refuse to sell it.

2188
02:31:47,822 --> 02:31:50,044
[SPEAKER_10]: If they'd just done that to begin with, there wouldn't have been a problem.

2189
02:31:50,748 --> 02:31:55,750
[SPEAKER_04]: To be perfectly honest, I do not believe the whole 48 hours thing.

2190
02:31:56,031 --> 02:32:07,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, during my time working in these big chain companies, when companies like Square, Nintendo, and everybody else, when they're going to do something like that, they send a notice out.

2191
02:32:08,497 --> 02:32:14,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually about two to three weeks prior, before do this.

2192
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:17,581
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I really believe that

2193
02:32:18,763 --> 02:32:22,965
[SPEAKER_04]: The Big G knew about this, but they were just waiting what to do, what to do.

2194
02:32:23,405 --> 02:32:33,051
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I feel that they decided, oh, let's wait about this time, pull the code out, and just start all it is.

2195
02:32:33,491 --> 02:32:37,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of it could have been a publicity stunt, which I find hard to...

2196
02:32:38,226 --> 02:32:42,507
[SPEAKER_04]: But from my retail experience, I don't believe that they just found out two days prior.

2197
02:32:42,887 --> 02:32:44,308
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point.

2198
02:32:44,328 --> 02:32:47,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't understand how any other chain had an issue with it.

2199
02:32:47,808 --> 02:32:48,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?

2200
02:32:48,369 --> 02:32:52,650
[SPEAKER_10]: It does seem like the memo went out to pull those codes really early on.

2201
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:54,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, I don't know.

2202
02:32:54,830 --> 02:32:55,970
[SPEAKER_10]: But what do you think, though?

2203
02:32:56,511 --> 02:32:58,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you buy Deus Ex on PC out of curiosity?

2204
02:32:59,591 --> 02:32:59,851
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2205
02:33:00,912 --> 02:33:02,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let's assume you had.

2206
02:33:02,852 --> 02:33:03,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2207
02:33:03,932 --> 02:33:06,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think you would have used that coupon for OnLive?

2208
02:33:07,366 --> 02:33:10,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not, no.

2209
02:33:10,608 --> 02:33:12,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that coupon's really that big a deal.

2210
02:33:12,789 --> 02:33:21,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I think people are going to go use it to check out on live and go, ooh, that's kind of neat, and play it for five minutes and then be done with it.

2211
02:33:21,112 --> 02:33:23,854
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like Portal or something.

2212
02:33:24,174 --> 02:33:27,035
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not as rich as that kind of connection.

2213
02:33:27,515 --> 02:33:31,898
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was just the whole thought that, oh my gosh, they're taking out a $50 coupon.

2214
02:33:33,746 --> 02:33:35,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's another thing.

2215
02:33:35,267 --> 02:33:36,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, Valve did the same thing.

2216
02:33:37,087 --> 02:33:40,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the big G having an issue with it.

2217
02:33:41,129 --> 02:33:45,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe the whole spin on how they had this agreement with Valve, you know.

2218
02:33:46,311 --> 02:33:55,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to be perfectly honest, let's say Square Enix says, oh, because of this, we're no longer selling our products to you.

2219
02:33:56,718 --> 02:34:02,581
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know since Square Enix is one of the big players out there, it would not surprise me if other manufacturers were like, you know?

2220
02:34:02,861 --> 02:34:03,361
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a note.

2221
02:34:04,042 --> 02:34:18,449
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's as easy as that because, you know, Evil G, or as I like to call him, the Evil Genius, the Evil Genius has a huge hold on, you know, the share of the games that they push through is gigantic.

2222
02:34:19,009 --> 02:34:21,711
[SPEAKER_04]: True, but I prefer to call them Gazpacho Stop.

2223
02:34:25,239 --> 02:34:27,321
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure we could sit here and think of names all day.

2224
02:34:27,741 --> 02:34:27,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2225
02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:50,999
[SPEAKER_04]: of the price.

2226
02:34:51,759 --> 02:34:54,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Wherever you bought it from, by law, they have to give you the difference.

2227
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:56,160
[SPEAKER_04]: State or federal?

2228
02:34:56,340 --> 02:34:57,020
[SPEAKER_10]: State or federal?

2229
02:34:58,200 --> 02:34:58,420
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2230
02:34:59,001 --> 02:35:00,281
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.

2231
02:35:00,341 --> 02:35:03,321
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's a price drop within 30 days, they have to give you the difference.

2232
02:35:03,341 --> 02:35:04,502
[SPEAKER_04]: State law or federal law?

2233
02:35:04,762 --> 02:35:08,462
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't sound like a law at all.

2234
02:35:08,522 --> 02:35:09,202
[SPEAKER_04]: It's consumer law.

2235
02:35:09,242 --> 02:35:10,663
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the things I had to learn about.

2236
02:35:10,703 --> 02:35:14,243
[SPEAKER_07]: But is that consumer law for New York or is it for federal?

2237
02:35:14,843 --> 02:35:15,804
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be the deal, Rama.

2238
02:35:15,844 --> 02:35:17,544
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be because I've never heard of that here either.

2239
02:35:18,205 --> 02:35:20,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know it's New York State law.

2240
02:35:20,989 --> 02:35:23,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, same thing in Jersey, Connecticut, and a bunch of other states.

2241
02:35:24,113 --> 02:35:30,122
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would not surprise me if it's a federal law, but you know how some people do that whole federal law dance thing.

2242
02:35:30,162 --> 02:35:33,447
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of those things we don't get out here on the West Coast, like hurricanes.

2243
02:35:35,353 --> 02:35:36,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I slept through, by the way.

2244
02:35:37,455 --> 02:35:38,356
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard a lot of people did.

2245
02:35:38,416 --> 02:35:40,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mean to make light of a bad situation.

2246
02:35:41,259 --> 02:35:44,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, people in Vermont did not fare as well as people in New York City, from what I understand.

2247
02:35:45,342 --> 02:35:45,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

2248
02:35:45,943 --> 02:35:46,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope everybody's alright.

2249
02:35:46,644 --> 02:35:48,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we're going to let you go, Ranma.

2250
02:35:48,665 --> 02:35:48,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2251
02:35:49,246 --> 02:35:49,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

2252
02:35:50,527 --> 02:35:50,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2253
02:35:51,868 --> 02:35:52,129
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2254
02:35:52,829 --> 02:35:55,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to go into this aside real quick before we take another call.

2255
02:35:55,532 --> 02:36:02,137
[SPEAKER_10]: We got more calls coming in, but I want to do this real quick because we were talking about scary games earlier, and several people in the chat room brought up Amnesia.

2256
02:36:03,038 --> 02:36:03,999
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's the thing, though.

2257
02:36:04,019 --> 02:36:08,803
[SPEAKER_10]: The story of the Dark Sakura was about 360 games, and Amnesia is a PC-only game.

2258
02:36:08,883 --> 02:36:09,364
[SPEAKER_10]: However—

2259
02:36:09,844 --> 02:36:10,404
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2260
02:36:33,290 --> 02:36:34,171
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never seen these.

2261
02:36:34,211 --> 02:36:38,134
[SPEAKER_10]: This could be a horrible segment, but I want to try playing one of these on air here.

2262
02:36:39,875 --> 02:36:40,735
[SPEAKER_10]: What is this called here?

2263
02:36:41,356 --> 02:36:42,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want your stupid advertisement.

2264
02:36:42,437 --> 02:36:43,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get through the advertisement.

2265
02:36:43,637 --> 02:36:47,280
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Funny Freakouts Here to Amnesia.

2266
02:36:48,641 --> 02:36:50,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get to this.

2267
02:36:52,564 --> 02:36:53,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

2268
02:36:53,324 --> 02:36:55,305
[SPEAKER_10]: A Funtage, I guess they're calling this.

2269
02:36:55,366 --> 02:36:55,966
[SPEAKER_10]: He says a minute 33.

2270
02:36:56,026 --> 02:36:56,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me start it there.

2271
02:37:12,908 --> 02:37:15,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, no, good, good, good.

2272
02:37:15,830 --> 02:37:16,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, shut up.

2273
02:37:16,450 --> 02:37:22,212
[SPEAKER_02]: In there, in there, hide, in there, get in there, jump in, jump in, close the door, close, close both doors, both doors, both doors, stop, stop, close, close, close, close.

2274
02:37:22,232 --> 02:37:22,632
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't take it.

2275
02:37:22,652 --> 02:37:35,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't

2276
02:37:36,405 --> 02:37:38,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, Jesus Christ!

2277
02:37:38,266 --> 02:37:39,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Jesus Christ!

2278
02:37:39,767 --> 02:37:40,467
[SPEAKER_00]: No!

2279
02:37:40,507 --> 02:37:40,807
[SPEAKER_00]: No!

2280
02:37:41,007 --> 02:37:41,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Run!

2281
02:37:41,647 --> 02:37:42,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Run!

2282
02:37:42,308 --> 02:37:42,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Run!

2283
02:37:43,068 --> 02:37:43,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Run!

2284
02:37:43,588 --> 02:37:45,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I go?

2285
02:37:45,309 --> 02:37:45,969
[SPEAKER_00]: I hide in there!

2286
02:37:46,209 --> 02:37:47,530
[SPEAKER_00]: I hide over here!

2287
02:37:47,630 --> 02:37:48,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you!

2288
02:37:49,651 --> 02:37:50,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus!

2289
02:37:54,133 --> 02:37:55,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Run!

2290
02:37:58,835 --> 02:38:03,377
[SPEAKER_10]: See, that's the problem, is that when you do 360-only games, you can't include amnesia.

2291
02:38:04,537 --> 02:38:05,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to pay 20 bucks for that.

2292
02:38:06,517 --> 02:38:07,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I have amnesia.

2293
02:38:07,297 --> 02:38:12,540
[SPEAKER_10]: You should come over and we should make a reaction video to amnesia because we'll both scream like 12-year-old girls.

2294
02:38:12,640 --> 02:38:12,880
[SPEAKER_10]: We will.

2295
02:38:13,220 --> 02:38:15,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I want it, but I don't want to pay 20 bucks for it.

2296
02:38:16,262 --> 02:38:16,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I have it.

2297
02:38:16,822 --> 02:38:18,102
[SPEAKER_10]: You should come over one night.

2298
02:38:19,103 --> 02:38:20,203
[SPEAKER_10]: We could do this on Halloween.

2299
02:38:20,423 --> 02:38:21,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2300
02:38:22,404 --> 02:38:24,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Were we talking about this at breakfast or was it talking about with Salacious Pop?

2301
02:38:24,985 --> 02:38:25,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting old.

2302
02:38:25,486 --> 02:38:26,006
[SPEAKER_10]: I forget things.

2303
02:38:26,206 --> 02:38:27,107
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about it this morning.

2304
02:38:27,127 --> 02:38:31,354
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about it at breakfast because we were talking about Castlevania or something.

2305
02:38:31,454 --> 02:38:33,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, no, we got to play something really scary.

2306
02:38:33,497 --> 02:38:37,002
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to play Amnesia, which I have yet to... I bought it, but I haven't played it yet.

2307
02:38:37,523 --> 02:38:39,806
[SPEAKER_10]: So you'd get some genuine reactions out of me.

2308
02:38:40,106 --> 02:38:41,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll do that.

2309
02:38:41,168 --> 02:38:41,669
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be down for that.

2310
02:38:45,137 --> 02:38:47,699
[SPEAKER_10]: We might have to have an OLR Halloween special.

2311
02:38:47,979 --> 02:38:50,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of like Nickelodeon would do.

2312
02:38:50,841 --> 02:38:53,362
[SPEAKER_10]: The Mark Summers Halloween mansion or whatever.

2313
02:38:53,403 --> 02:38:57,925
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to do Amnesia Night with DarkSakura, Rob Roberts, and maybe Loki.

2314
02:38:58,146 --> 02:38:58,426
[SPEAKER_07]: You hear?

2315
02:38:59,547 --> 02:39:01,988
[SPEAKER_07]: You know when I scream to when my voice goes away?

2316
02:39:02,008 --> 02:39:02,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Be quiet.

2317
02:39:04,090 --> 02:39:04,450
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2318
02:39:05,711 --> 02:39:07,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to some more calls.

2319
02:39:08,192 --> 02:39:10,754
[SPEAKER_10]: We've made these people wait through amnesia reaction videos.

2320
02:39:10,774 --> 02:39:11,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2321
02:39:11,755 --> 02:39:12,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2322
02:39:14,025 --> 02:39:14,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up, guys?

2323
02:39:14,666 --> 02:39:15,226
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Kaijudo.

2324
02:39:15,246 --> 02:39:15,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

2325
02:39:15,847 --> 02:39:16,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we can.

2326
02:39:16,408 --> 02:39:17,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Hiya, Kaijudo.

2327
02:39:17,068 --> 02:39:17,389
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

2328
02:39:18,229 --> 02:39:18,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, not much.

2329
02:39:18,810 --> 02:39:23,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to tell you, Rob, last week you spoke about the game Covert Action.

2330
02:39:23,515 --> 02:39:25,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Sid Meier's Covert Action.

2331
02:39:25,697 --> 02:39:26,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was actually my favorite game.

2332
02:39:26,698 --> 02:39:28,540
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the CIA calling you right now.

2333
02:39:29,822 --> 02:39:29,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

2334
02:39:30,002 --> 02:39:30,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

2335
02:39:30,990 --> 02:39:31,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, we can hear you.

2336
02:39:32,371 --> 02:39:38,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, anyway, that was a favorite game of mine too, and I found it about three years ago.

2337
02:39:40,118 --> 02:39:48,765
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play it for free online on the PC, and also, you might like this, you'll be able to play it on your Nintendo DS if you have an R4 card.

2338
02:39:49,486 --> 02:39:51,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually play it while I'm in the bathroom.

2339
02:39:54,030 --> 02:39:55,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Doing some espionage of your own.

2340
02:39:55,771 --> 02:39:57,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where I do my best work, man.

2341
02:39:59,901 --> 02:40:02,301
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, if you have an R4 card, it's really simple.

2342
02:40:02,321 --> 02:40:03,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure Loki can help you out.

2343
02:40:03,802 --> 02:40:11,843
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the R4 card, you get the covert action ROM somewhere online where you can find it, and then there's like some type of application.

2344
02:40:11,883 --> 02:40:15,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it, because I have a few of them on my R4, so I don't know which one it is.

2345
02:40:15,724 --> 02:40:25,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the Apple II emulator that you can put on your DS with the R4 that gives you the covert action, or it might be one of the others, but it's real easy to find.

2346
02:40:25,946 --> 02:40:26,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2347
02:40:27,947 --> 02:40:29,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have an R4 cartridge.

2348
02:40:30,149 --> 02:40:31,330
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a spare R4.

2349
02:40:31,350 --> 02:40:33,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Loki will let me borrow one of his.

2350
02:40:34,552 --> 02:40:35,112
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

2351
02:40:35,232 --> 02:40:36,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I loved Covert Action.

2352
02:40:36,133 --> 02:40:37,514
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what it is about that game either.

2353
02:40:37,874 --> 02:40:40,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, Sid Meier, he's the man.

2354
02:40:40,576 --> 02:40:42,258
[SPEAKER_05]: He's made so many good games.

2355
02:40:42,978 --> 02:40:44,579
[SPEAKER_05]: And he doesn't like that game for some reason.

2356
02:40:44,799 --> 02:40:49,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you mentioned yesterday people said that it was like too many games in one.

2357
02:40:49,180 --> 02:40:54,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Sid Meier, that was actually Sid Meier said that they tried to do too much in one game.

2358
02:40:54,943 --> 02:41:00,004
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like four separate games that none of them were really fully realized.

2359
02:41:00,585 --> 02:41:05,366
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be fair, the driving game was always kind of dumb anyway.

2360
02:41:05,767 --> 02:41:09,368
[SPEAKER_10]: The best part was the actual one where you broke in to the facilities.

2361
02:41:09,388 --> 02:41:09,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2362
02:41:09,628 --> 02:41:10,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Cryptogram, Switchboard Puzzles, Logic Puzzles

2363
02:41:39,782 --> 02:41:40,443
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2364
02:41:55,117 --> 02:41:56,317
[SPEAKER_05]: to play that version of the game.

2365
02:41:56,617 --> 02:41:59,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, Actdeft in chat says Piracy Lounge Radio.

2366
02:41:59,698 --> 02:42:02,439
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I legit own this game back in the day.

2367
02:42:02,499 --> 02:42:03,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

2368
02:42:03,659 --> 02:42:07,860
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to let them know, the game is officially free online.

2369
02:42:07,900 --> 02:42:09,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like you're pirating the game.

2370
02:42:09,881 --> 02:42:12,222
[SPEAKER_05]: There's somewhere where they provide it to you for free.

2371
02:42:12,662 --> 02:42:13,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, the...

2372
02:42:14,557 --> 02:42:15,637
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2373
02:42:32,771 --> 02:42:34,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, this game looks awesome.

2374
02:42:35,153 --> 02:42:36,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's Cthulhu Saves the World.

2375
02:42:36,714 --> 02:42:37,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've never played it.

2376
02:42:37,534 --> 02:42:39,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, those are on Xbox Live Indie Marketplace.

2377
02:42:39,776 --> 02:42:42,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to hang up and let you get to your next call.

2378
02:42:42,618 --> 02:42:44,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for being courteous, Kaijudo.

2379
02:42:44,159 --> 02:42:44,859
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very nice of you.

2380
02:42:45,359 --> 02:42:45,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

2381
02:42:46,280 --> 02:42:49,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death 7 are three bucks.

2382
02:42:51,263 --> 02:42:52,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say there was a story one week.

2383
02:42:53,104 --> 02:42:53,885
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember how long ago.

2384
02:42:54,225 --> 02:43:01,290
[SPEAKER_10]: They sold more on Steam of those games in one weekend than they did the entire time the game was on Xbox Live Indie Arcade.

2385
02:43:01,790 --> 02:43:02,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

2386
02:43:02,431 --> 02:43:03,793
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, the games are like really cheap.

2387
02:43:03,813 --> 02:43:04,234
[SPEAKER_10]: They're fun.

2388
02:43:04,595 --> 02:43:04,975
[SPEAKER_10]: They're cute.

2389
02:43:04,995 --> 02:43:09,302
[SPEAKER_10]: They're definitely a throwback to the old school Super Nintendo RPGs with humor.

2390
02:43:10,023 --> 02:43:12,267
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the Cthulhu one because Cthulhu is cute.

2391
02:43:13,569 --> 02:43:14,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever see Hello Cthulhu?

2392
02:43:16,790 --> 02:43:17,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I have.

2393
02:43:17,290 --> 02:43:18,771
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the Hello Kitty doll, but it's Cthulhu.

2394
02:43:18,951 --> 02:43:23,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's actually Cthulhu ending up in the Sanrio universe and corrupting Hello Kitty.

2395
02:43:24,393 --> 02:43:24,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

2396
02:43:24,553 --> 02:43:26,694
[SPEAKER_07]: The person only did like a few of them, but they're super funny.

2397
02:43:26,774 --> 02:43:31,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Would that look like the Hello Kitty in the Ursula outfit doll that I bought Salacious Pop?

2398
02:43:31,575 --> 02:43:33,416
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's just a super cute Cthulhu.

2399
02:43:34,396 --> 02:43:38,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a little SD Sanrio style Cthulhu hanging out with a gothed out kitty.

2400
02:43:38,638 --> 02:43:41,919
[SPEAKER_10]: I still really want you to have your World of Warcraft character named Ursulol.

2401
02:43:42,532 --> 02:43:45,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe I'll remake Fatty Cakes into Ursula.

2402
02:43:45,333 --> 02:43:46,733
[SPEAKER_07]: But Fatty Cakes is a good name, too.

2403
02:43:47,534 --> 02:43:48,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make Ursula.

2404
02:43:48,174 --> 02:43:49,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go to another call.

2405
02:43:49,494 --> 02:43:50,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2406
02:43:50,374 --> 02:43:50,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2407
02:43:51,355 --> 02:43:52,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku here.

2408
02:43:52,255 --> 02:43:52,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, buddy.

2409
02:43:52,735 --> 02:43:53,275
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing?

2410
02:43:54,056 --> 02:43:55,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good, as usual.

2411
02:43:56,116 --> 02:43:56,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, good.

2412
02:43:56,456 --> 02:43:56,756
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

2413
02:43:58,457 --> 02:43:58,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

2414
02:43:59,198 --> 02:44:13,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what I wanted to bring up was the fact that Activision is kind of like trying to get the folks currently on the fence like myself from Modern Warfare 3 on the PC by just like re-adding things that they took out.

2415
02:44:13,645 --> 02:44:17,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Case in point, LAN support, in addition to adding dedicated servers.

2416
02:44:18,026 --> 02:44:23,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I don't know, on one hand they're trying to make a man's brand, on the other it's

2417
02:44:24,680 --> 02:44:26,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to believe it has to be a bait and switch.

2418
02:44:27,122 --> 02:44:31,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting, because I remember hearing that they took it out, but I did not hear about them putting it back in.

2419
02:44:31,386 --> 02:44:33,228
[SPEAKER_02]: That was for Modern Warfare 2.

2420
02:44:33,828 --> 02:44:34,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2421
02:44:35,370 --> 02:44:39,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so Modern Warfare 3 will actually have land support.

2422
02:44:39,974 --> 02:44:49,322
[SPEAKER_10]: We know Blizzard is a huge part of Activision, obviously, and they've come under fire lately because StarCraft 2 does not have the land, and Diablo 3 is not going to have it either.

2423
02:44:50,089 --> 02:44:53,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're all going to be online for better or for worse.

2424
02:44:53,612 --> 02:44:57,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to say it, but I sort of support it with Diablo 3.

2425
02:44:57,575 --> 02:44:57,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2426
02:44:58,175 --> 02:44:58,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

2427
02:44:59,256 --> 02:45:03,019
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing with Diablo 3 is that, let's face it, Diablo 2 was hacked to hell and back.

2428
02:45:03,660 --> 02:45:06,022
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't play that game online with strangers.

2429
02:45:06,122 --> 02:45:06,862
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so broken.

2430
02:45:07,163 --> 02:45:09,004
[SPEAKER_10]: You can really only play with people you trust.

2431
02:45:09,384 --> 02:45:15,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if they had kept a LAN campaign separate from an online campaign, they could have done it.

2432
02:45:16,010 --> 02:45:18,672
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of disappointing, but there's always Torchlight 2.

2433
02:45:20,458 --> 02:45:21,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that does help.

2434
02:45:21,859 --> 02:45:25,902
[SPEAKER_10]: The $20 price tag that was confirmed this week helps too.

2435
02:45:27,203 --> 02:45:46,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I guess I could I'll probably give them the benefit of the doubt, but seeing this Activision and the fact that they reneged on it back in Modern Warfare 2 when they promised that they were going to have dedicated servers and so forth, only to find out a few weeks before launch that it was quite the opposite.

2436
02:45:47,397 --> 02:45:48,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to get fooled again.

2437
02:45:51,144 --> 02:45:55,028
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think of the whole Call of Duty Expo that they did, the Call of Duty XP or whatever?

2438
02:45:55,108 --> 02:46:01,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard bits and pieces, like people actually doing paintball matches to some of the maps in there.

2439
02:46:01,955 --> 02:46:08,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like, I guess they're trying to hype it up to the point where, you know, it's all marketing at this point.

2440
02:46:08,722 --> 02:46:08,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

2441
02:46:09,443 --> 02:46:28,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the idea is that Call of Duty is for, you know, quote-unquote kind of like the douchebags game of choice in that regard, whereas Battlefield 3 is mostly for the hardcore nerd gamer that plays these types of FPSs like Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.

2442
02:46:28,998 --> 02:46:34,261
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the type of demographic I see EA targeting, you know, with BF3.

2443
02:46:35,382 --> 02:46:38,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Call of Duty is kind of like the dumbed-down, basic...

2444
02:46:40,219 --> 02:46:44,127
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the one they're trying to get everyone on board with.

2445
02:46:45,029 --> 02:46:46,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a frat boy type game.

2446
02:46:48,154 --> 02:46:53,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm generalizing, and you can sue me if you want, but I'm just... No, it's fine.

2447
02:46:54,018 --> 02:46:58,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so uneducated on all those games, and it's not that I dislike them.

2448
02:46:58,241 --> 02:47:00,923
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just not my thing, and I suck at them.

2449
02:47:00,943 --> 02:47:01,803
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so terrible at them.

2450
02:47:02,083 --> 02:47:03,304
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like some people in DDR.

2451
02:47:03,344 --> 02:47:07,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people think DDR is just... What the hell is that music that's coming out of that machine?

2452
02:47:07,587 --> 02:47:08,668
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and not everybody gets it.

2453
02:47:08,688 --> 02:47:09,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

2454
02:47:09,408 --> 02:47:10,069
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, the...

2455
02:47:10,789 --> 02:47:20,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what Activision is banking on is the mere fact that they can sell a shitload of copies of that game, of Modern Warfare, without having to change a lot.

2456
02:47:21,980 --> 02:47:29,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And hoping that as long as you hype it up to the point where they kind of need to have it, are also going to be the...

2457
02:47:31,242 --> 02:47:34,845
[SPEAKER_02]: The Unluckiest Kid in the Block without their copy of Call of Duty.

2458
02:47:35,545 --> 02:47:48,115
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like they're trying to create a mindset where you have to one-up your friend or your neighbors and covet that copy of Call of Duty that he has.

2459
02:47:49,656 --> 02:47:56,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Battlefield 3, on the other hand, is going for more detail, more replay, more

2460
02:47:57,335 --> 02:48:01,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say a lot more features than what Activision is offering.

2461
02:48:01,437 --> 02:48:05,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It's aiming towards being a simulator.

2462
02:48:05,420 --> 02:48:06,680
[SPEAKER_02]: A military simulator.

2463
02:48:07,241 --> 02:48:08,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Are most people just going to get both?

2464
02:48:09,662 --> 02:48:10,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right.

2465
02:48:10,282 --> 02:48:11,203
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get both.

2466
02:48:11,283 --> 02:48:19,447
[SPEAKER_02]: But I could see a lot of those uneducated regular token gamers are going to just get Modern Warfare 3.

2467
02:48:20,648 --> 02:48:22,469
[SPEAKER_02]: The really hardcore ones, they're going to get both.

2468
02:48:22,989 --> 02:48:25,031
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to balance time in between the two.

2469
02:48:25,371 --> 02:48:25,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

2470
02:48:27,132 --> 02:48:30,677
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like there's so much I want to play this holiday season.

2471
02:48:30,777 --> 02:48:32,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, isn't that the case every holiday?

2472
02:48:32,859 --> 02:48:39,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Somehow I will have to juggle my time between Skyrim, Diablo 3, Torchlight 2, and God knows what else I'm forgetting.

2473
02:48:40,208 --> 02:48:41,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario Kart on the 3DS.

2474
02:48:41,950 --> 02:48:44,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought Diablo 3 wasn't coming out this year.

2475
02:48:44,653 --> 02:48:45,213
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it will.

2476
02:48:46,014 --> 02:48:51,637
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't said one way or the other, but the friends and family beta is going on right now, which means the public beta is probably next month.

2477
02:48:52,137 --> 02:48:55,359
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're going to announce at BlizzCon that it's coming out within the next month.

2478
02:48:56,100 --> 02:48:58,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Why wouldn't they try to make end of year and have a huge thing?

2479
02:48:58,741 --> 02:49:01,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Blizzard hasn't released anything else this year.

2480
02:49:01,843 --> 02:49:05,004
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't release Diablo, they've released nothing.

2481
02:49:05,044 --> 02:49:10,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And they still have to get the expansion pack for StarCraft 2, which is probably next year anyways.

2482
02:49:10,307 --> 02:49:12,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Diablo 3 and an expansion and two WoW expansions.

2483
02:49:29,540 --> 02:49:29,980
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

2484
02:49:30,080 --> 02:49:31,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes sense.

2485
02:49:32,061 --> 02:49:35,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty much all of them are going to be on PC unless they do second-hand ports.

2486
02:49:36,723 --> 02:49:39,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I guarantee Diablo 3 will end up on consoles.

2487
02:49:39,243 --> 02:49:41,104
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just not going to be the same time as PC.

2488
02:49:42,244 --> 02:49:46,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and this is why you always want to, with Blizzard, it's always PC or nothing.

2489
02:49:47,186 --> 02:49:49,967
[SPEAKER_10]: People forget Diablo was on the PlayStation.

2490
02:49:50,447 --> 02:49:51,348
[SPEAKER_10]: StarCraft was on the 64.

2491
02:49:51,408 --> 02:49:54,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Some things are better left forgotten.

2492
02:49:55,249 --> 02:49:55,389
Yeah.

2493
02:49:55,973 --> 02:50:02,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some things are better left forgotten than Blizzard's half-assed ports of their properties back in the day.

2494
02:50:02,739 --> 02:50:04,381
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Warcraft comes to mind.

2495
02:50:05,061 --> 02:50:09,825
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been 15 years since Diablo on the PlayStation 1, so it's worth a try.

2496
02:50:10,446 --> 02:50:12,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed it on my PC.

2497
02:50:13,108 --> 02:50:13,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough said.

2498
02:50:13,829 --> 02:50:16,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show and have fun.

2499
02:50:17,711 --> 02:50:18,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2500
02:50:19,012 --> 02:50:19,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

2501
02:50:19,992 --> 02:50:21,813
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he's gonna be broke this holiday season, too.

2502
02:50:21,833 --> 02:50:23,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot to ask him how much money he plans to spend.

2503
02:50:24,355 --> 02:50:26,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, sadly, that's gonna do it for the Skyplane.

2504
02:50:26,036 --> 02:50:28,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I want someone with money to get me a Moonkin Hashling.

2505
02:50:30,058 --> 02:50:30,818
[SPEAKER_10]: They're what, ten bucks?

2506
02:50:30,978 --> 02:50:31,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2507
02:50:31,599 --> 02:50:32,259
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not too bad.

2508
02:50:32,779 --> 02:50:34,420
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's virtual pets.

2509
02:50:34,720 --> 02:50:35,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2510
02:50:35,080 --> 02:50:37,202
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I said I want someone else to do it.

2511
02:50:37,222 --> 02:50:39,443
[SPEAKER_10]: How about I donate ten dollars to a charity in your honor?

2512
02:50:39,463 --> 02:50:39,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh.

2513
02:50:41,098 --> 02:50:41,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2514
02:50:41,478 --> 02:50:41,778
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2515
02:50:41,798 --> 02:50:42,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, what the hell?

2516
02:50:43,359 --> 02:50:44,219
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, moving on.

2517
02:50:44,519 --> 02:50:46,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to finish up the tweets so we can finish up the show tonight.

2518
02:50:47,140 --> 02:50:48,841
[SPEAKER_10]: We just had a handful of other tweets.

2519
02:50:49,501 --> 02:50:53,743
[SPEAKER_10]: An interesting one from Tiger Claw tweeting OLR at twitter.com slash OLR.

2520
02:50:54,103 --> 02:50:58,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Study suggests virtual goods purchasing differs by ethnicity.

2521
02:50:59,145 --> 02:51:03,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh boy, this could be a... All right, let's see what this is all about.

2522
02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:11,762
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an article from Gamasutra that we were linked to on Twitter by user TigerClaw305.

2523
02:51:12,602 --> 02:51:20,105
[SPEAKER_10]: New study published Friday by mobile game community MocoSpace suggests that virtual goods purchasing behavior may be affected by ethnicity.

2524
02:51:20,805 --> 02:51:29,247
[SPEAKER_10]: A survey of anonymous data from 40,000 mobile social gamers revealed that both Caucasians and African Americans over-indexed on virtual goods spendings.

2525
02:51:29,667 --> 02:51:38,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Caucasians in particular were responsible for 26% of virtual goods purchases made during the study period, despite representing only 18% of those studied.

2526
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:41,150
[SPEAKER_10]: African Americans made up 36% of the respondents and made 38% of the purchases.

2527
02:51:44,591 --> 02:51:51,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Those calling those Hispanic under-indexed despite compromising 31% of the sample pool, they made only 21% of the purchases.

2528
02:51:52,474 --> 02:51:53,634
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, what does this all mean?

2529
02:51:54,054 --> 02:51:55,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers.

2530
02:51:55,315 --> 02:51:55,895
[SPEAKER_10]: What does this mean?

2531
02:51:56,475 --> 02:52:04,378
[SPEAKER_10]: According to MocoSpace CEO Justin Siegel, the rapid growth of virtual goods industry means that it, quote, makes sense to really start segmenting it.

2532
02:52:04,798 --> 02:52:06,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not really understanding, like, how, but whatever.

2533
02:52:29,963 --> 02:52:32,225
[SPEAKER_10]: People get paid to break that data down, just so you know.

2534
02:52:32,365 --> 02:52:33,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody got paid to do that study.

2535
02:52:35,487 --> 02:52:37,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Last tweet to us tonight from WatchDragon.

2536
02:52:38,229 --> 02:52:40,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Beat Space Marine on hard.

2537
02:52:40,330 --> 02:52:41,090
[SPEAKER_10]: What is Space Marine?

2538
02:52:41,110 --> 02:52:41,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that just Halo?

2539
02:52:42,792 --> 02:52:45,213
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's Warhammer 4 UK Space Marine.

2540
02:52:45,433 --> 02:52:47,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Aha, that would explain the rest of this tweet.

2541
02:52:47,995 --> 02:52:49,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I play the tabletop Warhammer.

2542
02:52:49,936 --> 02:52:51,397
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true to the story and fluff.

2543
02:52:52,818 --> 02:52:53,238
[SPEAKER_10]: And fluff.

2544
02:52:54,920 --> 02:52:55,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

2545
02:52:56,721 --> 02:52:59,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for educating me, Loki, because I did not pick that up.

2546
02:52:59,843 --> 02:53:01,524
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not play Warhammer Tabletop.

2547
02:53:01,564 --> 02:53:04,666
[SPEAKER_10]: The only Warhammer I've ever played was that MMO they put out a couple years ago.

2548
02:53:05,147 --> 02:53:06,748
[SPEAKER_10]: You played Warhammer Tabletop, didn't you, DarkSakura?

2549
02:53:06,788 --> 02:53:07,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell no.

2550
02:53:07,608 --> 02:53:08,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I dated someone who did.

2551
02:53:09,450 --> 02:53:15,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's... So sick of those stupid little... Oh, you had figurine trauma in that relationship.

2552
02:53:15,254 --> 02:53:20,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, because... I tried playing Warhammer 40k Space Marine.

2553
02:53:20,837 --> 02:53:25,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Warhammer 40k Space Marine was more of the larger scale... Well...

2554
02:53:26,221 --> 02:53:31,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Larger scale battles, smaller scale figurines, the actual Space Marines are 6mm tall figurines.

2555
02:53:32,510 --> 02:53:33,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not paint those.

2556
02:53:34,012 --> 02:53:36,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried painting them, I'm like, fuck that, it's too damn small.

2557
02:53:38,647 --> 02:53:39,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2558
02:53:39,167 --> 02:53:40,248
[SPEAKER_09]: And I threw it all away.

2559
02:53:40,628 --> 02:53:42,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm like, I don't get this game.

2560
02:53:42,769 --> 02:53:45,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played Dungeons and Dragons in like four years.

2561
02:53:45,250 --> 02:53:46,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I should play sometime.

2562
02:53:46,331 --> 02:53:46,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2563
02:53:46,711 --> 02:53:48,311
[SPEAKER_10]: God, I sound like a total nerd.

2564
02:53:48,351 --> 02:53:49,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I didn't throw it away.

2565
02:53:49,592 --> 02:53:51,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I might have it in a box somewhere.

2566
02:53:52,553 --> 02:53:52,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2567
02:53:53,514 --> 02:53:54,974
[SPEAKER_10]: That does it for Twitter topics tonight.

2568
02:53:55,054 --> 02:53:55,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Tweet us for next week.

2569
02:53:55,915 --> 02:53:57,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

2570
02:53:57,996 --> 02:54:00,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to Loki and see if he has any last minute stories.

2571
02:54:01,918 --> 02:54:06,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Just real quick, rookies won't appear in NBA 2K12 until lockout's over.

2572
02:54:08,362 --> 02:54:10,804
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be an update or something like that for free.

2573
02:54:10,884 --> 02:54:12,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Lockouts are ruining everything.

2574
02:54:12,305 --> 02:54:14,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Once that happens, you won't be able to play as the rookies.

2575
02:54:18,129 --> 02:54:24,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there's a mysterious move game in development from the people that did, uh, Linger in Shadows.

2576
02:54:24,135 --> 02:54:32,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that really weird dog flying thing with the basset hound and the shadow creature that looked like the squid from the Matrix or whatever?

2577
02:54:32,604 --> 02:54:34,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I don't remember that and it's probably for the best.

2578
02:54:35,512 --> 02:54:37,474
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2579
02:54:58,460 --> 02:55:21,342
[SPEAKER_09]: they could very well be like trying to put some sort of touch sensitive glove or something in the play because almost like all this stuff is just focusing on the textures of different things and obviously with the movie you're not going to be able to feel any of that so I don't know but right now weird video that's online so you can check it out and that's pretty much it

2580
02:55:24,565 --> 02:55:28,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2581
02:55:28,969 --> 02:55:30,590
[SPEAKER_10]: So, DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

2582
02:55:30,670 --> 02:55:31,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Your final thought tonight.

2583
02:55:32,412 --> 02:55:32,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Duffy.

2584
02:55:34,494 --> 02:55:36,615
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought tonight is tacos!

2585
02:55:37,056 --> 02:55:37,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Again.

2586
02:55:38,177 --> 02:55:40,118
[SPEAKER_10]: And bacon cupcakes, causing sugar headaches.

2587
02:55:41,399 --> 02:55:43,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Those cupcakes, single-handedly, are going to make me diabetic.

2588
02:55:43,361 --> 02:55:44,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a sugar headache right now.

2589
02:55:44,722 --> 02:55:45,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

2590
02:55:45,143 --> 02:55:47,465
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I ran to get water during one of the reports.

2591
02:55:47,925 --> 02:55:48,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy.

2592
02:55:48,886 --> 02:55:51,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Loki, your final thought tonight.

2593
02:55:51,656 --> 02:55:56,918
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is I made a flamethrower in Grand Theft Auto and no one else has.

2594
02:55:57,778 --> 02:55:58,998
[SPEAKER_10]: And happy birthday once again.

2595
02:55:59,158 --> 02:55:59,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope you had a good one.
