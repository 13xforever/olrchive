00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky and Lowkey!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,540
Tonight September 11th, 2011, details leak on the new 3DS circle pad, Xbox Live issues

3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:28,000
bans for theft, and is the Wii U running into problems?

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of that show

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We are live on this Sunday night and you can head over to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
if you want to participate live in our chatroom.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you want to hear the stream, hopefully you're already on the stream,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but I'll say it for the sake of the podcast listeners,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
you can tune in Sunday nights at www.allgames.com

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
First off, say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hi.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How are you, Miss Summers?

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hungry.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You're hungry, but it looks like you're eating over there,

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
so you're getting that hunger problem fixed, right?

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's very nutritious.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Nutritious, delicious?

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's brown rice and tempeh with okonomiyaki sauce.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I love brown rice and vegetables.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Really?

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Alright, no.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's worse than dog food?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Really?

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Dog it, chow.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Also, say hello to the one, the only, tech master, Loki.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hello.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And how are you, Loki?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm fine.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And of course, to answer the question in our chat room,

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
what did you get for dinner tonight?

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, I got another double bacon western burger,

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but I'm not even really that hungry,

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
but I figured if I don't eat something, I'm going to be hungry later,

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
because I had a big lunch, but it was round one.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If I don't eat anything between 1 o'clock and 11 o'clock or whatever,

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll probably be starving by 11.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You know what I had to hold me over for tonight's show is a frappuccino.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's the food I had this week.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But I will be getting something more substantial after the show.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hey, it's pumpkin spice frappuccino.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's really good.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Alright.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What is your kick with pumpkin spice lately?

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is my favorite time of year.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I love pumpkin.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I love pumpkin pie.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
They have pumpkin pop tarts now, and oh my gosh,

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
they now make Hershey's Kisses that are pumpkin spice flavored.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's heaven.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's great.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And they don't pay me to say that.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It really is that good.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Or to quote Rob from Wow last night,

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
it tastes like world peace.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It did taste like world peace.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Alright, we do have a guest on tonight's show.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
At least he's going to join us for at least the first half here.

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And it's someone that used to come to OLR all the time,

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
but we have not seen her in a very, very long time.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think you guys will be pleasantly surprised to hear back on the show,

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Miss Irene is joining us tonight.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How are you?

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm good.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You guys might've known her as Rice Princess about a hundred episodes ago,

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but I think she has left that name behind.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You know, it's okay to use it for Orange Land Radio,

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
because that's how people know me here.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't understand when you do want a nickname.

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Like when does Prince want to be Prince?

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He's always Prince.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh yeah, I'm like Prince 2.0.

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Alright.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, welcome back to the show Rice Princess.

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's new in your world?

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let me have you reintroduce yourself for those that are like newer to Orange

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Land Radio who weren't here a hundred episodes ago.

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're a gamer girl, obviously.

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Sort of.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I mean, like, yeah, I don't know.

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I've kind of...

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What, you don't play games anymore?

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I thought you did.

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's not that I'm not interested in playing games.

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I just don't have time.

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But I would if I could.

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Have you been playing anything lately?

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No.

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Really?

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No.

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I thought you and your boyfriend had a Wii,

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and at least were playing stuff on that, or is it mostly him?

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's mostly him.

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I have a Gamefly account, and he'll get games,

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and then I'll watch him play them,

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
but I just don't have the energy to play anything.

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, then get off the show.

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm just kidding.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But you do love your classic games at least, right?

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I do.

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And I mean, like I said, I will play games when I have the time.

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Just I'm very busy.

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Alright.

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You kind of sound like a lot like Salacious Pop last week who mentioned

110
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
when he was here that he's more into like gaming culture.

111
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes.

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's kind of the thing.

113
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah.

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So that's kind of where you're at too.

115
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Well, what would you say are like some of the best video games ever made?

116
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Your favorites?

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, like my favorite is Chrono Trigger.

118
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Final Fantasy Tactics is like it's pretty close to Chrono Trigger.

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Super Metroid.

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Just like really from the Super Nintendo era,

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
most of the games on the Super Nintendo.

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Like Super Nintendo was just like perfect gaming, wasn't it?

123
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That was the golden system.

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes, it was.

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I agree in many ways.

126
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't know if gaming will ever be that good ever again.

127
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Like gaming is just different now.

128
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, yeah.

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It just is.

130
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Especially like a game I was playing this week that I'll get into later

131
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
in my gaming week is like it's like interacting with a movie now.

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's like it's like it's not I mean, it's not a bad thing.

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's just you know, and maybe this is a little bit of get off my lawn

134
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
syndrome, but it's just not the same like it was.

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
No, no, you know.

136
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
OK, so if you have been listening for a while, you know that I hate

137
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Microsoft and like the Xbox systems that they have.

138
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But we actually ended up buying one.

139
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Like I finally allowed my boyfriend to let to have one in the house,

140
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
which is a huge deal because when you were on the show before,

141
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you were very staunch, anti Microsoft, anti Xbox.

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, but.

143
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, what?

144
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes, I am.

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No, no, I just mean console wise, like I don't like Microsoft,

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
but the Wii is a piece of shit.

147
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The PS3 is way too much and they don't have any good games.

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And it's just he really wanted one.

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I'm like, fine, you know, I can't hold them back any longer.

150
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It kind of I have to admit that it's probably the best system out right

151
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
now, console wise.

152
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So but when we get games on that console,

153
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I really feel like an idiot, like a retard.

154
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Like, I don't know what I'm doing.

155
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
They're all first person shooter controls.

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And like you kind of have to go to game college to to like learn the

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
controls on these games.

158
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's crazy.

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You want to go back and just play puzzle fighter?

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I want two buttons on my controller.

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
God damn it.

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm tired of all this stupid bullshit.

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But no, I mean,

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I guess it just takes a little bit more effort to learn how to play a game.

165
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But I don't know.

166
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Some of the games are pretty good.

167
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here on the show tonight?

168
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Usually our guests want to plug something.

169
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No, not really.

170
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
OK. Thought I thought I'd offer.

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
All right.

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, you'll be joining us throughout the show and offer your witty insight

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and commentary. Please do.

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Maybe as we continue on throughout tonight's show.

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Dark Soccer wants her mic back.

176
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I really like your Avengers T-shirt.

177
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Thank you very much.

178
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
All right.

179
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I just looked over and saw Ms. Marvel and it made me happy.

180
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I want to get into a couple discussion topics before we get into tonight's

181
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
gaming weeks and all that, how we always start off the show.

182
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But I have to mention this at some point.

183
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Today's a very big day.

184
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I have to address the elephant in the room.

185
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It is September 11th, 2011,

186
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
which obviously 10 years ago was a horrible,

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
horrible day that we should never forget.

188
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I was fortunate when I was 17 years old.

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I got to go to the Trade Center and I have a very vivid memory of being on

190
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
the roof of the Trade Center.

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But I drove by it with a big hole in it.

192
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, when you it was right after the bottom floor got bombed.

193
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, gosh.

194
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's when I was 17.

195
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Wow. And it's just, you know, the whole thing,

196
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
watching it on TV was just just just so difficult and everything.

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And, you know, we have a lot of listeners in New York City and Washington

198
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and back east and all those places that were affected.

199
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And it's like, you know, the impact we felt three thousand miles away.

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I can't even imagine just that experience.

201
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So, you know, we should never forget what happened.

202
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
However, it is important, you know, video games.

203
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's something that we do to escape sometimes the pains the real world.

204
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I know when I have a shitty day at work,

205
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I like to come home and blast things on my Xbox. It's fun.

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So, you know, if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise just kick the cat.

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Stop. You do not. You love your cat.

208
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If we can make you laugh on what is otherwise,

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
she wouldn't feel it. No, she wouldn't.

210
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I do pet her with my foot, though, so I don't have to bend over.

211
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
As I was saying, if we can make you laugh on what is otherwise kind of a tough day for some people,

212
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
then I think we've done our job. So and fuck terrorists like seriously.

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Fuck them. They suck. So if we do what we do.

214
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Then they don't get it. We can commemorate something else today.

215
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's right. Let's move on, because something else monumental happened today 31 years ago.

216
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And you know what that is? Loki was born, everybody. It's Loki's birthday.

217
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yay. Happy birthday, Loki.

218
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So in commemoration, it looks like Irene has actually brought over some bacon cupcakes for Loki.

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I love this. Did you get a picture up on the website?

220
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes, I did. Awesome.

221
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They should be on orangejonesradio.com. Go look at it now.

222
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll eat them later. I can't eat them right now. I'm too full from the other bacon stuff.

223
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I really shouldn't have eaten that. It was too much.

224
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's like milkshake or bacon burger.

225
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's like bacon burger. Should have gone with the milkshake.

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So any good video game related loot for your birthday or not yet?

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Nope. Well, someone, I really hate not remembering. Someone gifted me Xbox Live code last night.

228
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I didn't get to check what it was for yet.

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So that's kind of cool. You'll have to check that out. Let's see.

230
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I was going to look up real quick. Ryan Belnap gifted me something from Xbox Live.

231
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I will go check that out and I really appreciate it. I didn't really get on my Xbox today.

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It was like last night sucked. My cat was being an asshole.

233
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So I didn't get it. Hardly any sleep. Maybe a few hours.

234
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Today I ended up sleeping in and then it was out to lunch and then came back.

235
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I was messing with Grand Theft Auto stuff. Didn't get a chance to boot it back up again.

236
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, I hope your birthday is awesome and congratulations.

237
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Thank you.

238
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We're all in our 30s now. So it's the podcast. Oh, not Irene, but you're just visiting tonight.

239
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So yeah, we're now the podcast for those in their mid 30s. Awesome.

240
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Whatever. I understand what's hip and cool nowadays.

241
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Except for toy trends, I don't understand that crap.

242
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I think they're just making all sorts of weird shit up now and kids are just buying it and I don't get it.

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You know what? When kids are maybe about one and a half and younger, they don't care.

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
They'll play with the box, save some money and buy them a box.

245
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I seem to recall, Josh, your kid really loved the Kinect calibration card.

246
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Still does.

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Still does. The wacky, creepy happy face.

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They're like, babies are like cats.

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You can go buy the most expensive cat toy ever, but they don't care. They want to play with the twist ties and the box.

250
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So if you drop them from six feet, they'll land on all fours?

251
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No. I said they're like cats. I didn't say they were cats.

252
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And besides that, it's not like they have clear vision until they're, you know, 10 months old anyway.

253
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It is pretty true that they do like all sorts of random stuff.

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Usually, I mean, he'll chase after sunlight on the floor.

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So pretty much anything amuses him.

256
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Save money, everybody. Don't buy them toys. Buy them twist ties.

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
There you go. All right, going to a couple of discussion topics here before we get into our gaming weeks.

258
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I want to mention this comment from our chat room. Of course, the chat room is always live with us.

259
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
chat.orangelaundry.com

260
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This, I think, is an interesting follow-up to what I believe Irene was saying a minute ago

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
when she was kind of talking about how she had a distaste for Xbox for so long

262
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and kind of just got over it and has one in the house now.

263
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I like this comment from Eric K. I'm curious what you guys think about it.

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm more loyal to games than systems anyway.

265
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Kind of an interesting comment, and I see Irene shaking her head over there.

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What do you think of that comment?

267
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I was nodding my head.

268
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Shaking it up and down, of course.

269
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes, of course.

270
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No, I mean, I can understand that.

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, really, okay, when we grew up, we only had one system in the house at a time.

272
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We didn't have a Genesis and a Super Nintendo and all that stuff.

273
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think we all grew up in families that couldn't afford that.

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Except for you.

275
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No, I didn't have a Genesis and a Nintendo and all that stuff at the same time.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I only ever had Nintendo systems.

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I had a Nintendo, Super Nintendo.

278
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Well, I lied because then I had a PlayStation, but I didn't have a 64.

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, I've been pretty loyal to Nintendo.

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I threw away a 64 one day.

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Oh my gosh.

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Well, I bought it from my ex-girlfriend's brother at the time, and then I was just like,

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't want this, so I threw it away.

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You just threw it away.

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Exactly.

286
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
No, it wasn't even, it was way later.

287
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I just decided one day I didn't want it anymore, so I threw it away. Carry on, carry on.

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No, it was way later.

289
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We're talking like in the 2000s when I bought the Super Nintendo 64.

290
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It wasn't, you know, it wasn't a new system by any means.

291
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We still had our Clicca vision when I was a kid, and then we got, my dad got me a NES,

292
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and then I had a SNES, and then I traded with my friend and had his Genesis for a while,

293
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
traded back, and then rented a TurboGrafx for like my graduation deal or something.

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And then my friend's, my roommate's boyfriend left his PlayStation in the room

295
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
because he didn't have a TV in my dorm room.

296
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So I did have multiple systems, but it was because of circumstance.

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So I think it all goes with the golden rule of gaming, going back to the comment, you know,

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
what we always say here on Orange Andrea, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I was very much, you know, an Xbox hater for the first generation of Xbox systems,

301
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
but then after that, it was just kind of alright.

302
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Well, when I borrowed my friend's Genesis, he had a power-based converter

303
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and tons of Master System games too, so.

304
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I think PlayStation 3 is coming an awfully long way too.

305
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You know, when they first came out, they were kind of the laughing stock of the industry,

306
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and for many good reasons, but you know, despite the hack earlier this year,

307
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
which I still say, Microsoft isn't as invulnerable as all y'all think.

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Remember, I had $150 stolen just last month.

309
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I have a follow-up on that I'm going to get to in a minute, by the way.

310
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But I think PlayStation 3 is coming off a long way since then.

311
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I think they got a lot of really good stuff going for them there.

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Obviously, Little Big Planet is like one of my favorite games ever to come out this generation,

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
so lots of good stuff.

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Anyhow, other things I want to talk about.

315
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I guess I'll mention the Xbox Live hack.

316
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Okay, if you go back about, what, four weeks ago on the show,

317
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I talked about how I had money stolen from my Xbox Live account,

318
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
called Microsoft, was told that in 21 days, they'd get the money back and whatever.

319
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I got an email from them about 25 days after.

320
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It was about Wednesday, saying that they, you know, apologized for the inconvenience,

321
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
duh-duh-duh, but they did the investigation and that they concluded it was indeed fraudulent

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and I will be getting the money back on my account.

323
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And then they sent me like three separate codes for one month of Xbox Live Gold.

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So I guess the cool thing is, even though I haven't been able to play my Xbox for the past 21 days,

325
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
25 days, month basically, I got the codes.

326
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So now I got to extend out my Xbox Live Gold for three months.

327
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So I guess that's cool, but I'm still waiting for the money because the email I got said,

328
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
it may take up to 10 days for the money to actually get credited to your credit card or whatever.

329
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And I'm just like, oh my God, it's been over a month.

330
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That's 150 bucks I had to eat for a month.

331
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I mean, luckily I have a savings account, but it's just kind of irritating.

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I mean, really, it takes that long to figure out that a different IP and different MAC address,

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Xbox, probably in another country, logged in and did it, you know, it's just, come on.

334
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But whatever, at least it's on the path to getting fixed

335
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and I was able to finally play the 360 this week a little bit.

336
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll talk in a moment about some things I was playing on there.

337
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
One other thing I want to bring up because I was thinking about this today.

338
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I was at Fry's, which obviously is a big retailer out here on the West Coast,

339
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
a big electronics store, and was looking at 3DS games randomly.

340
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And, you know, Star Fox 64 just came out.

341
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And I was looking at the Namco Generations had just come out as well,

342
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
which is, you know, for us folks that like our retro games, it's like a Pac-Man reimagining,

343
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Pac-Man Championship Edition, I think Galaga.

344
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's a Pac-Man and Galaga Legions, or Dimensions, I'm sorry.

345
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah, you know, Dimensions, so it's all like 3D and all that stuff.

346
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And I was really tempted to get it.

347
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Don't.

348
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Well, here's the thing, I looked at the price tag and I was like, it's 40 bucks.

349
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
40 bucks?

350
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
3DS games are 40 bucks.

351
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I get that, but...

352
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I know, it's Pac-Man.

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's interesting to me because they just recently cut the cost of the 3DS from $250 to $160.

354
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But I don't know if that's really the problem.

355
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The problem are those games.

356
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Those games are too expensive.

357
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'll talk to my Namco guy.

358
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
He's like, dude, I got tons of 3DS games.

359
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Well, I just ended up giving them away to my friends.

360
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm like, sweet, cool, send me some.

361
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I mean, I'm not gonna say no to that, that's for sure.

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But for the masses and everybody out there, and even other games, like Star Fox 64,

363
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I might have considered buying it if it was 20 bucks.

364
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah, you know why?

365
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's because they claim that it takes extra development time to develop the extra dimension

366
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
or whatever it is.

367
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Or maybe the dev kids cost a little bit more.

368
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
No, the cost more for the other dimension is a load of turd because they came out and

369
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
they said any game that uses a z-axis in calculation, you can easily adapt it to 3DS.

370
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, yeah, it's just another virtual camera.

371
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's ridiculous.

372
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Anybody who says that that extra dimension should cost more money is full of crap.

373
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No, it's just because it's a new generation, they think they can up the prices.

374
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And I think that's gonna be the problem holding it back.

375
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You know, and it's interesting to me because there's been a lot of talk lately about how

376
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
stubborn Nintendo has been and how much they have really not liked the mobile gaming stuff

377
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
because 99-cent Angry Birds has been cheapening, quote-unquote, the game industry as a whole.

378
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And I'm kind of like, well, I don't think 99-cent Angry Birds is the reason why I feel

379
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
like a $40 Pac-Man Galaga game is a rip-off.

380
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I don't care how many dimensions the fucking game has.

381
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm just like, $40 is a lot.

382
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Nintendo's dumb in the sense that they think that a game like Angry Birds, a very basic

383
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
physics puzzler game, I mean, didn't take that much to develop.

384
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I mean, it was probably just a couple guys in a room, you know, putting it together real quick.

385
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Done. Game, you just create levels and you're done.

386
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
They could make a Super Mario Bros. game, like a Super Mario Bros. episodic game running

387
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
on the All-Stars engine or something like that and make new levels in a level editor,

388
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
charge 99-cents, and people eat that shit up.

389
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You could have just like 20 levels in it.

390
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It wouldn't take that long to even make.

391
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You don't have to do anything new.

392
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Just make new levels.

393
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Done. 99-cents.

394
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You put it right out there, everyone will buy that shit.

395
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The price of all these games really has to make me stop and think about what I really want.

396
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I mean, you know, even $60 for a 360 or PlayStation 3 game is asking a lot of money.

397
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And there's only a certain kind of game that I'm willing to pay that for.

398
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Gone are the days that you would just pick up a game on a whim.

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You know what I mean?

400
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Like, remember when you just, yeah, pick up a game on a whim.

401
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It looks interesting. I'll try it.

402
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You know, those days really seem gone.

403
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Looking at the holiday, there's so many games coming out and I'm really having to choose,

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
like, okay, I gotta drop 60 bucks on all these games.

405
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What am I actually gonna buy? Skyrim.

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
See, that's the thing, though, is, yes, gone are the days of buying something on a whim,

407
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
not necessarily playing something on a whim, especially some, you know,

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
how easy it is to pirate things nowadays on certain systems.

409
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah, but that's a whole nother Oprah.

410
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You know what I mean?

411
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Like, it's just, not even going into the piracy angle.

412
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Let's just say that most people don't do that.

413
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't, I don't...

414
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
A lot of stuff, like, I'll look at games, you know, they're coming out, I'm like,

415
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
hey, you know what, that'd be kind of cool to get, but then I ask myself,

416
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
am I really gonna play this?

417
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Because I have a lot of games that I buy and end up not really playing or finishing or something,

418
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and I figure I should just finish the ones I have first and then buy the ones I really want

419
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and end up just not missing the ones I end up skipping on.

420
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You know, interesting comment in our chat room.

421
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Part Machine in our chat says, if people played PC games, this would not be a problem.

422
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Interesting that that comment is said because one of the places where I do buy things on a whim,

423
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
just because they're cheap and they look interesting, is Steam.

424
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You know, I bought a game on there for like $1.50 the other day.

425
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Why? Because it was $1.50 and it was a puzzler and it looked interesting and I like puzzle games.

426
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And if it sucks, eh, it's only $1.50, right?

427
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So, funny enough, that is the place where I tend to spend a little more frivolously.

428
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So, I don't... maybe he's right.

429
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Well, just like, you know, like virtual console stuff. Remember, virtual console stuff is like $6 a pop for NES games.

430
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I mean, fuck, you can get those NES games in NES form on cartridges for a lot cheaper than that.

431
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And I just, I don't see the point, especially when they're not doing anything.

432
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
They're dumping a ROM into an emulator. Why should I give you money for that?

433
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I can go download that for free.

434
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Is this a rant about the Mario 25th Anniversary Collection disc?

435
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh! Well, that's just stupid. And I knew that from the get-go.

436
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm like, okay, whoever buys this is retarded because all it is is it's just, it's literally a port of the game and they did nothing to it.

437
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Nothing at all to the game.

438
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And, oh, it has a soundtrack in there, but because it says Mario 25th Anniversary Edition, people are gonna eat that stuff up.

439
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And you know what? That right there, that game is a perfect analogy of Nintendo and its consumer base.

440
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
People will bitch and moan that they don't get their import game in there, but you know what?

441
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're the same dumb fuckers that are buying a game that they didn't change, that they released on the system a long time ago,

442
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and they're selling for, I'm guessing, more than what the game actually costs anyways.

443
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You only have yourself to blame for Nintendo having $40 games on the 3DS.

444
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's because you're an idiot and you will buy this $30 Mario game. That's literally wrong.

445
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They could have put it on the Virtual Console, sold it for $10, and went with it in the same damn game.

446
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But no, Nintendo being smart, they said, hey, you know what? We're gonna charge $30 for it.

447
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We'll call it limited edition. We're actually gonna make it limited.

448
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And now that shit goes on eBay for like $80 because people are dumb.

449
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Well, at the same token, today I said no to buying that game.

450
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I looked at the game and I said, this looks really good, but I'm gonna wait for it to end up in the clearance bin.

451
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah, and I know, I mean, I said the same thing about the Mario game. I'm like, eh, screw it.

452
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But at the same time, a lot of other people didn't, and they're all sold out.

453
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And I understand, yeah, they may have been quite limited, but we're talking limited as in a few hundred thousand copies.

454
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I mean, that's a lot of money that they made from a ROM.

455
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Speaking of PC games, that chat comment has me thinking, and Steam and Good Deals, I've gotta plug this.

456
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I just, I have to. As a fan of this game, Civilization V is on sale right now.

457
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And probably by the time the podcastees hear this, the sale will probably be done, because I think it was just the weekend.

458
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But at least for the live folks, it's like $12.50 right now for Civ V.

459
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
My favorite Civilization since the original, for real.

460
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
That's the game that last week on the show I said I was up until 2 in the morning playing one night,

461
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
because, wow, where did the time go? With friends.

462
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So, if you like strategy games, even in the slightest, or if you've ever enjoyed a Civilization game a little bit,

463
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
you should drop the money to check it out. For real.

464
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So, anyhow, I guess we should move on and talk about our gaming weeks.

465
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So, we always like to start off the show with talking about our gaming weeks,

466
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
even if we're not really starting the show with it, but whatever, play along.

467
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

468
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I played WoW.

469
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
WoW? What a different week for you.

470
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I got Rebecca Black to 80.

471
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I think it's funny you have a character named Rebecca Black that hasn't had a change.

472
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I made it as a total joke.

473
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That hasn't had a change your name yet.

474
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
No. Well, I'm not gonna pay to change your name. If they want me to change your name, they're gonna give me a free name change.

475
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
They usually do.

476
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And then I'm gonna name her Becca Black.

477
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Or maybe Lady Ark Music.

478
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Friday?

479
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Friday, that'd be funny.

480
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Well, I was gonna change Fatty Cakes to Ursulal, but I like Fatty Cakes.

481
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And then I played some Tiny Tower and Sims.

482
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I played Sims 3 and the stupid other Sims.

483
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
This freaking addicting as I thought.

484
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Sims Facebook.

485
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I just completely rearranged my house while you were here.

486
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Sims Facebook is one of those things I am ashamed to admit I play.

487
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's fun.

488
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
No, it's terrible.

489
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's great. It's really actually just like playing Sims except, you know, you can't rotate your house.

490
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Here's the thing. They have got to cool it with the posting to the wall and all that stuff.

491
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Like, I thought that they went after the makers of Farmville because that shit was spamming everything too much.

492
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And you can't tell me. Sims Social, like, Slices Pop was telling me.

493
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
He tried to find a video that he posted to my wall and he couldn't find it amongst all the bullshit Sims Social posts.

494
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And you can block the app, but that only goes so far.

495
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Like, then when you go to the page, it doesn't show anything.

496
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You keep having to load because that Sims Social posts so much stuff.

497
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I mean, it's just...

498
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I want the game to come out on Google Plus because at least Google Plus kind of exiles that all to one.

499
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Like, the game stuff all has to be on a separate page.

500
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah.

501
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I really want Sims Social on Google Plus, but they probably won't bring it there for that reason.

502
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That's probably how they've got an assload of players is because it's all over Facebook.

503
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And people are like, the Sims? I love that game.

504
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm pissed off that my mother hasn't become my neighbor and I'm going to fuss at her.

505
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
No, I'm kidding.

506
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,000
But I'm apparently, though, in the game, randomly dating, like, one of my old friends from the AOL days.

507
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I am actually a dating Mistress Tia, if you remember her from the show.

508
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
We're boyfriend and girlfriend in Sims Social, and she came over for some woohoo the other day.

509
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I can't woohoo my girlfriend in-game because she doesn't have a double bed, but we can play in the bathtub.

510
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Wow!

511
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You can click on the bathtub and woohoo in the bathtub.

512
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's going to be one of those weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.

513
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I found the mod, by the way, for Sims 3.

514
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Wait, don't you have a spa in your house? You can't woohoo in the spa?

515
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
At her house.

516
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Trust me, you can woohoo in the spa.

517
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
At her house.

518
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Oh, okay. I see.

519
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But I did find there's a patch for Sims 3 where you can change woohoo to fuck.

520
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Nice.

521
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And they're finally breaking the animations where they're doing items with custom animations, so everyone look toward Sexy Sims 2 for new mods.

522
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Because I had a ton of them on Sims 2 because I'm a little prevert.

523
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I also played some Osotatakeo Endon while I was at school because I was bored.

524
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I started reading a book, but I don't like it, so I'm not going to read it anymore.

525
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I have to write a review on it, so look on Geek Life for the Too Long Didn't Read.

526
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Alright.

527
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Plug.

528
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Let's move on to Techmaster Loki. How was your gaming week?

529
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Didn't play a ton of different things, mainly just Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon.

530
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm starting to level up my jet character now, so that's at level 5, I believe.

531
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And my tactical's at 8, and just playing a little bit more of that.

532
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
We were trying to play some of the remixed missions on Inferno.

533
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's as hard as Inferno on the first game, which is really hard.

534
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Then more Grand Theft Auto stuff. I've been messing around with that.

535
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And made some new mods that no one's done yet, so I'll have to work on that stuff later on.

536
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
What else did I play?

537
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I think that's pretty much it. I tried that vid rhythm once, and it was just kind of like, eh.

538
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Which didn't end up being a game. Although the app itself is kind of a neat concept.

539
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's a fun little, huh, neat. You run it and you go, huh, neat.

540
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But it's not a game, and I was kind of disappointed by that.

541
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Because I wanted Harmonix to do an awesome frequency game on the iPhone.

542
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That didn't happen. I'm sad.

543
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
There's nothing really rhythm about it. It's just vid record clip.

544
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Vid clippin'.

545
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Pretty much, yeah.

546
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Anything else in your gaming week?

547
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
That's it.

548
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I know, Irene, you said you've been very busy at school lately.

549
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Is there anything that you have been playing in the past week or so that you want to acknowledge?

550
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Guild Wars.

551
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Oh, you've been playing Guild Wars. Like old school Guild Wars, huh? How's that been going for you?

552
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Well, it's been going well.

553
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
What do you do in Guild Wars? Why do you keep playing Guild Wars?

554
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Because it's free and I don't have a lot of time to play, so I won't feel like a stupid bitch if I pay $15 a month for a game that I never play.

555
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So Guild Wars, I've always kind of called the game, at least there's always Guild Wars.

556
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You know, when you have to quit WoW and Final Fantasy XI or whatever your MMO addiction is of choice,

557
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
at least there's always Guild Wars if you've bought it at some point, whether it be back when it first came out or one of those ridiculous Steam sales.

558
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
If Final Fantasy XI goes free to play, I don't know where my life's going to take me then.

559
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Well, not to change the subject, but there's an interesting rumor I've come across.

560
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,000
They did a survey for the Final Fantasy XI player base about what systems people are playing Final Fantasy XI on.

561
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And people are drawing conclusions from this that Final Fantasy XI is looking to ditch the PlayStation 2 because that's what's holding it back, tech-wise.

562
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If Final Fantasy XI could ditch the PlayStation 2, they could do all new textures, the game could get an overhaul.

563
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That would be very interesting because then Final Fantasy XI could hypothetically look like Final Fantasy XIV but not suck.

564
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It'd be very interesting.

565
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Why don't we just get rid of Final Fantasy XIV and just pretend it doesn't exist?

566
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Tell everybody, hey, you know what? I know you bought Final Fantasy XIV. We're just going to make it XI.

567
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
We'll call it XIV. We'll just upgrade XI to XIV.

568
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Let me go back to Guild Wars for a minute because I got to say, I am really excited looking at the Guild Wars 2 footage even though it doesn't really look like Guild Wars 1 at all.

569
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And I know you can kind of start earning stuff for Guild Wars 2 in Guild Wars right now.

570
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Are you excited about Guild Wars 2 at all?

571
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Fuck yes, I am. Oh my god, it looks so awesome. I'm so excited.

572
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Why does it look so good?

573
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Because it's not WoW. Every other fucking MMO that's come out in the past five years, all cheap imitations of WoW, this does not even remotely look like WoW.

574
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:20,000
They really try to go out of their way in their developer stuff to really say, this isn't like other MMOs.

575
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
We're trying to not approach this like other MMOs. We're not trying to emulate other MMOs.

576
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But my only issue with that is that's what everybody else has said too and it just ends up being WoW.

577
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:37,000
But you know what, they're able to back up their claims. If you look at the gameplay footage, if you look at the screen art, all that stuff, you know that it's different from WoW.

578
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So it's not just another WoW clone.

579
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Is that supposed to be a 2011 release or is that not until next year?

580
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They haven't even done beta for it. So it's not going to be out for a while.

581
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Gotcha. Well good, that's one less game I have to buy this year.

582
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It looks pretty awesome from the stuff I've seen.

583
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'm way more interested in that than even like Old Republic. Sorry Star Wars fans, but Guild Wars 2 looks awesome.

584
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah, I could talk for hours about it, but I won't.

585
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Oh, but you should. Why don't you start right now?

586
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And then you're just going to cut off my mic.

587
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Alright. Anyhow, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

588
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Nope.

589
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Alright. My gaming week. I finally, after like weeks and weeks, and I know this is old news to a lot of you, but this is why I've been playing.

590
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I played L.A. Noire finally for the first time, which was what I was referring to earlier when I said I was playing a game that felt like playing a movie a little bit.

591
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And yeah, L.A. Noire. Wow. I gotta say though, I like it more than I thought I would.

592
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm not usually super into these Grand Theft Auto games and certainly there's components of L.A. Noire that kind of feels like, oh, it's Grand Theft Auto in the 40s.

593
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But that's really just like the driving around stuff and a little bit of the combat stuff.

594
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I liked the interrogation and the clue finding and all that stuff, even though I am so fucking terrible at interrogations.

595
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I can't believe how much I bombed what is supposed to be like the easiest fucking case in the game.

596
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And I think my biggest issue is I am unable to figure out why there is truth.

597
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Well, I figured it out, but at the beginning I couldn't figure out why you have truth, doubt, and lie.

598
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Because I was like, isn't doubt and lie like the same thing?

599
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Either they're telling the truth or they're not.

600
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I mean, there's no middle ground, but what it is is that lie means you have the evidence to back it up, that it's a lie.

601
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And doubt means you just don't believe them.

602
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But, you know, even in the first case where it's so, like their expressions are like over the top, like you can really read them.

603
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I was, I got every single question wrong my first time. Like multiple times.

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Like while I was trying to figure out what's going on.

605
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Thankfully the game didn't be all like, you lose, game over.

606
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It just kind of, I just got yelled at repeatedly by the boss and finally I got through it, figured out the right answers.

607
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But, um, I liked the expressions and the faces look really neat.

608
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And the voice acting is well done too. So, you're laughing over there, Irene.

609
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Yeah, I mean, the, you know, faces looked neat.

610
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Have you played it at all?

611
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I have not played it, but I watched one of our friends play it.

612
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And I think it's a stupid game.

613
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Why do you think it's stupid?

614
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It's corny. It's just, I mean like, okay, so you chase after a guy.

615
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,000
All right, fun. And then you like interrogate and it's just, it feels unnatural when you're trying to interrogate them.

616
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And then if you do it wrong, that stupid ass sergeant guy just like is crazy and he yells at you like he's a psycho.

617
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't know. And that just wasn't the point when I tuned out because I didn't care.

618
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's just, it's, it's almost like being on a game show because like you find out right away if you fucked up or not.

619
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Like you hit the button and right away it just fades up. Incorrect. And you hear a little doo doo doo.

620
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And I'm like, God damn it.

621
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yeah.

622
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And then they'll yell at you like the chicks all, get out of my store, you're an asshole.

623
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm like, but you totally looked like you were lying, bitch.

624
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Set your store on fire now.

625
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
See, that's where the game needed more Grand Theft Auto because like, bitch, I'm gonna set this store on fire then.

626
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But I couldn't do that because you're supposed to be a cop and cops don't set things on fire randomly, you know.

627
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Yeah. Elianore is not Grand Theft Auto.

628
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I listened to Dan play the whole thing cause I was in here and I was like, wow, this is historically accurate given the dialogue.

629
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And then like I saw the ending, I'm not going to spoil, but I was like, what? That's the ending.

630
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Well, they had to leave it for DLC, I guess. I don't know the ending, but.

631
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm not, no, I'm just gonna say it's what? When, when you see it, that's all.

632
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Well, we'll see. I don't know. I have the attention span of a three year old, so I don't know if I'll get that far, but I'll probably at least play it a few more times before I return it back to Loki.

633
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I've only had it for like two months. What's another month gonna, gonna hurt?

634
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's funny you say that because a three year old was watching me play well last night and she would not stop asking me questions.

635
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Really? What kind of questions is a three year old asking?

636
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I was an ice crown too, which was really boring.

637
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What kind of questions does a three year old ask about World of Warcraft?

638
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Are those bad guys? Yes, they're bad guys. I like bad guys. They're strong.

639
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah, but I have to beat up the bad guys, so I'm stronger than they are. Oh, well you're pretty cool too, but that bad guy's a big bug. Do they eat other bugs?

640
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You're playing, you're playing Horde, right?

641
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
No. Playing Alliance.

642
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Oh, well then nevermind.

643
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Also, you have to remember, Horde isn't the bad guys. It's just an alternative lifestyle. No, I don't know what you'd call it.

644
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It's the other, it's just the other faction, you know. Either you're a goat person or you're a cow person. It's just whatever.

645
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Space goat, coast to coast.

646
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Exactly. Exactly.

647
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Other games I've played this week besides L.A. Noire. I revisited the Wii a little bit this week because if you were listening to the show a couple weeks ago, I hacked my Wii and I have a drive now that I'm loading all my games to, which I'm, they're my games.

648
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I've been dumping them to the drive just because I can. I don't know, I just thought it would be fun. And now I never have to get up from the couch.

649
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Yeah, it's actually forced me to revisit a lot of old Wii games I haven't played in years, so I'm actually kind of glad I did it.

650
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And these are all games I've talked about on the show years and years ago when I first bought them. But I played Geometry Wars for a little while today, because you know Geometry Wars had the Wii version, but it's really weird because you have to actually point, you don't have two analogs on the Wii, right?

651
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So you have one analog and then you actually point on the screen for your other analog. And the nice thing about it, I don't know, it's a different way to control it. It's kind of cool, you can actually just point at the ships and it's, I don't know.

652
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But I like that the game had all sorts of different maps, all sorts of different types of modes. It's a fun game.

653
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And then I was randomly playing New Super Mario Brothers Wii today. Why? Because I could. And it was, they really just tried to remake Mario 3 with that game, I think.

654
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
As minimal effort as possible.

655
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Well, it's not a bad game, though.

656
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
No, it's not a bad game.

657
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's actually a pretty, one of the better games on the Wii.

658
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But see, that's the point. The point is, you don't have to spend a lot of development money to make a game. You could put out, you know, something that's very similar to another game, just change up the levels and then you don't charge as much. I don't know.

659
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So, let's see, what else did I play this week besides revisiting the Wii? Oh, 360! Since that's up and running again, I played Insane Twisted Shadow Planet. Because I was really into that game and then the Xbox got hacked and I was pissed off, so I played a little more of that.

660
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And it's getting to the point where it's getting a lot harder, but I basically have determined that this is like Metroid, but kind of like more of a puzzler. Which is kind of awesome.

661
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So, yeah, Insane Twisted Shadow Planet. I think you would actually really like it.

662
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Oh, did you try it, Irene?

663
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I've tried it. It's okay. That's the one where the robot flies around and he has to use his different like...

664
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The spaceship.

665
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yes.

666
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yes, yes, that's it.

667
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah, it's alright.

668
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Yeah? I like it. It's really fun.

669
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah.

670
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So, I'm in the ice world right now, which supposedly the game's only supposed to take like seven or eight hours to beat, but some of it's like really hard. Like, the difficulty really amped up really fast from the ocean level to the snow level, I noticed, is kind of interesting.

671
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I didn't even know there were other levels.

672
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, did you just play the demo?

673
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Yeah, just the...

674
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah, there's more. Like, kind of like how in Metroid you had, you know, the fire area where Ridley was and then like the plant area where, you know, Kraid was. Something similar to that.

675
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So, not nearly as good, but I mean, yeah. No, I know what you mean.

676
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:41,000
No, it's not. Like, the thing is Metroid kind of had the characters to kind of stick out and everything in Insane Twisted Shadow Planet kind of just looks like film noir and because it's so vague as to what the story really is, like, it doesn't have that strong character that Nintendo has a lot of their games.

677
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
But the game itself is still worth it. Absolutely.

678
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah, the environment's pretty immersive. I mean...

679
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah, and the art style's pretty rad.

680
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah.

681
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It's pretty good.

682
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Alright, so that's going to do it for my gaming week. I think that's enough for that. Let's quickly mention some housekeeping here.

683
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Join us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us on Twitter. Also, you can follow us on Facebook at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

684
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
We will be here back again next week with a show, but we will not be here in...

685
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I will not be here in two weeks, but I believe they're going to have a show without me. So tune in to hear more on that because I'm going to San Francisco and I'm not going to be here in two weeks.

686
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So I think they're trying to find a guest host or something.

687
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I want to go with you.

688
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I already bought the tickets. I'm sorry. You're expensive.

689
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah, that's okay. I have to thank you on air, by the way.

690
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Why?

691
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
For my present for kitty sitting.

692
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh, and at the Disneyland show when we were gone last time.

693
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I has a Duffy now. It's a Duffy purse, but he's cute and he lives on my wall.

694
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
There you go. Glad you like it. Thank you for house-sitting the cats who chewed up the $50 headphones I own while we were gone.

695
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Well, someone left them on the floor.

696
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I didn't, you know, you don't think, oh, I got to make sure that the cord isn't dangling a little bit from my desk.

697
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Honestly, if I had known, I would have taken care of it.

698
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I can't expect you to know.

699
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Can you tell me that you've watched that trailer that I just linked you to?

700
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
No, I haven't. Uh, what is this all about?

701
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
This is the brand new trailer for Saints Row the Third. It's highlighting their third gang called the Deckers.

702
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Oh boy. All right. Let's check this out before we get into the news.

703
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You're going to like this. You may have to buy Saints Row the Third.

704
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm already thinking I have to buy it.

705
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I think you should. And this, this is.

706
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
All right. I'm looking at a trailer rated M. Here we go.

707
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And this makes for a great rate.

708
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Oh my God.

709
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
They are dressed up in Tron like gear, like their jackets are all glowing, glowing blue.

710
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Keep watching.

711
00:41:48,000 --> 00:42:07,000
All right.

712
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:20,000
What? Oh, no. Keep watching. Okay. They're all racing on cars.

713
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, please tell me they're going to get on light pipes and shit.

714
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Wow. They're not even like trying to hide the fact what inspires this, are they?

715
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Dude, they're going to get sued right now.

716
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I can't wait to play this fucking game.

717
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
How is this at all like the other two games?

718
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm, I'm just confused.

719
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
You don't understand.

720
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Because, because with Saints Row, they've decided to just say, you know what, fuck it. We're not even going to just try to be a real game anymore.

721
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
This is all about excess. This game is just excessive. It's unnecessary and excessive.

722
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Each trailer, they go more over the top than the last one.

723
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And this, I don't know how you're going to get more over the top than going into a virtual world and fighting stuff Tron style.

724
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It's awesome.

725
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I want, I want now.

726
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Tiger Claw in our chat room also points out the fact that they're called the Deckards is a reference to Blade Runner.

727
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So it's not just Tron that's inspiring this, although visually it's certainly very, very Tron-esque.

728
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So yeah, Harrison Ford was Deckard.

729
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So anyhow, here's the thing. I'm almost sold on Saints Row 3, but it's also one of those, you know what, I don't want to buy into trailers.

730
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Just, I'm going to wait for the game to come out, see the reviews, see Loki's review. Very important.

731
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I know he thinks he's going to love it.

732
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I got to hear, look, dude, dude, what I was listening to Bobby's show before we were live tonight, right?

733
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
As I usually do on the car ride over and Madden came out this past week, which is usually like a huge release.

734
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Apparently Madden has, I mean, I don't really play the Madden games, but I know they're huge and everybody buys them.

735
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And they're very important, very, very high profile games. Probably only second to like a Call of Duty game.

736
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And apparently the menus fucking freeze and shit. Like just basic shit is broken in Madden, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing.

737
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
There's literally nothing that this game could do to make me not want to buy it.

738
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I mean, there's nothing. Absolutely nothing.

739
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And come out and say the next gang is My Little Ponies and I wouldn't fucking care.

740
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Although that would probably make me want to buy the game even more because it's so ridiculous.

741
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
What if you have to play Raiden for the rest of the game? Would you like play it still?

742
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yes.

743
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Oh, okay.

744
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I don't even understand, what?

745
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Wasn't that his name from Metal Gear Solid 2?

746
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Oh, okay. I see.

747
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Was that his name? Raiden?

748
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Yes.

749
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Okay. Nevermind.

750
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Alright. BlackWolf is in chat actually and points out deckers are also the term in Shadowrun for the grid hackers.

751
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So lots of references there.

752
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
That is very true. I've played one.

753
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yes, I did play Shadowrun.

754
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Alright, well thank you for derailing the show with that trailer. It's actually very interesting looking.

755
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Alright, let's actually get into the news we were planning on discussing tonight. 45 minutes into the show.

756
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And we'll start off with almost an immediate follow up to something last week that came up at the end of the show. Right, Loki?

757
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yes, last week right before the end of the show they were doing an announcement.

758
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Square Enix was talking about Dragon Quest X. Or at least they were going to make an announcement about Dragon Quest.

759
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That announcement was Dragon Quest X Online. It is an online RPG.

760
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And it is going to be, I'm not sure if it's still being, it looks like it's still being developed by level 5.

761
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And of course they're responsible for Dragon Quest VIII and IX.

762
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
The game is coming out on the Wii. Also I guess it's being developed for the Wii U as well.

763
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And I guess they're saying also they're considering the 3DS as some form of character transfers or something like that.

764
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It does of course require an internet connection being that it's an online MMO.

765
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And it's going to require a fee as well. So there's going to be some sort of usage fee for that.

766
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's kind of interesting because there's really no MMOs on the Wii.

767
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And considering the Wii is pretty much at the end of its life cycle already that's kind of weird.

768
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Yeah, I got to admit. We were talking about this briefly on the show last week because the press conference is about to start when we ended the show last week.

769
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And so I drive home, I get home, I go in the house and I fire up my reader to look at what news I missed while the show was going on.

770
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And there's an announcement about Dragon Quest X and I'm like, oh Dragon Quest X is going to be online? On the Wii?

771
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Online? Wii? Syntax error? I don't understand. How does this compute? You just divided by zero.

772
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:23,000
The Monster Hunter game over there was, I believe, had paid online as well. I'm thinking though that this is mainly just going to be a Wii U game.

773
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But that they're like, well you know what, we're going to make it.

774
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Since we promised it on the Wii.

775
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Let's make a version also for the Wii because, you know, we still have a user base for that.

776
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's like a Zelda-esque type of thing because remember Zelda Twilight Princess was a launch title but they had to make the GameCube version because they had originally announced it for GameCube and it was kind of the same hardware.

777
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Yeah, really more like, oh it was ready for the GameCube but they delayed it so they could put it as a Wii launch title.

778
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
That's exactly what they're doing here with Dragon Quest X.

779
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:06,000
But that whole MMO thing, they haven't said MMO, right? Because when I was looking at some of the stuff and reading about it, it felt more like White Knight Chronicles to me, which kind of was a single player game that had a huge multiplayer component.

780
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Or like, Phantasy Star Universe. I don't consider that game really an MMO. It's kind of like, I don't know how else to explain it. It's like multiplayer.

781
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It's Momo-ish.

782
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah, it's Momo-ish but it's not, I don't know.

783
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I guess. So they would probably have an offline component as well. I don't know if it's going to be online only, but when I hear usage fees and requires the internet, that screams MMO to me.

784
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:42,000
GameGuru in our chatroom says, from the makers of Final Fantasy XIV, from the publishers of Final Fantasy XIV, it is a different studio putting this together, right?

785
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Level 5 had nothing to do with Final Fantasy XIV, or any Final Fantasy game for that matter, that I can think of.

786
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So, no. These are different teams, it's important to say. I get your joke, but hopefully the MMO experience doesn't completely suck.

787
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Or whatever online adventuring experience they come up with, which I'm convinced is going to be more like White Knight Chronicles, which was kind of, like that game's really kind of a cult kind of game.

788
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It didn't really break through, but there's definitely a player base playing that game.

789
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:22,000
But, once again, this also begs one simple question. This game is definitely niche. It is very, very niche.

790
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You're talking about an online game. First off, an online MMO on the Wii. Not a lot of people are going to bite on that.

791
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And, it's an RPG. A Japanese-style RPG on the Wii. That's talk about narrowing the user base down quite a bit.

792
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:49,000
And yet, no Last Story or Xenoblade or anything like that over here. But, yet, they're going to bring that out.

793
00:49:49,000 --> 00:50:00,000
DDR Dollar Bill in the chatroom says, Explain how you guys define MMORPG. Here's the thing, I mean, obviously it's a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, right?

794
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
But the reason why Phantasy Star Universe kind of doesn't fall out of that category.

795
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Not Roleplay.

796
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,000
MMORPG. Yes and no. Here's the thing. And I'm not saying it's a bad game. God no.

797
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Phantasy Star Online, we wouldn't have fucking MMOs if it wasn't for that and Ultima Online.

798
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:26,000
But Phantasy Star Universe or any of those games, it's kind of like you have lobbies where you can interact with people and then you have the game.

799
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You form your parties in the lobby and then you really go play the game.

800
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But you have chat. You have voice chat. And that was a big component.

801
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
But there's nothing else. There's no game component really in those lobbies outside of shops.

802
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And playing hockey.

803
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
There's no PVP.

804
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And playing hockey.

805
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I don't know. That's why...

806
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And the giant choo-choo rocket level.

807
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I don't know.

808
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Well, I think that it better be an MMO because what am I paying online then for? Because the Wii, it's online and it's free.

809
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Why would I have to pay to play a game I just bought online?

810
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Because MMOs, you pay to play.

811
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Well, yeah, MMOs you pay to play. But if it's not an MMO, if we're just talking about a game with some 4 player, 16 player online...

812
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And White Knight Chronicles doesn't charge.

813
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah.

814
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And the sequel's actually coming out here, which surprised me.

815
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Sequel's coming out here and also includes the original on the same disc.

816
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah, as it did in all the other countries too.

817
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Yeah.

818
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Interesting.

819
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So for those that missed the first one. I did play the first one. I didn't play a lot of the...

820
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
You didn't play a lot last week.

821
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Oh, did it?

822
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Or...

823
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I might pick it up.

824
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It's either last week or this week.

825
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:37,000
The first one's not bad. It had its challenges. And it's weird because you can't actually do the online component until you've played single player for quite some time.

826
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
It's weird. It's a weird game, but I bet it's a lot bigger in Japan than it is here.

827
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
And just like Dragon Quest, you know this shit's gonna be crazy in Japan. All these games are.

828
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Oh yeah. I don't doubt it's gonna do well in Japan, but their user base is different than what it is over here.

829
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Unfortunately, over here, they really wanted to get consoles out, so they got consoles to all these non-gamers because the whole thing was,

830
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
oh, we're gonna expand our audience to non-gamers.

831
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Yeah, how fucking well did that work out for you guys?

832
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
A bunch of non-gamer people that aren't buying your games.

833
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Great idea.

834
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And then you totally ignored your hardcore gamer user base in the process.

835
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah, that's gonna work out really well for you for this next console as well.

836
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It's just, I don't think it's gonna do very well.

837
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I mean, just look at all the other niche hardcore games that have been out there.

838
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
RPGs and, you know, non-RPGs, they just haven't done well.

839
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And I understand this is gonna be published probably by, I don't know if it's Square Enix, I'm guessing Nintendo,

840
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
because they did the last Dragon Quest game and Dragon Quest Monsters 2 and stuff like that.

841
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
So if it's published by Nintendo, I mean, there'll be some more marketing behind that,

842
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
but it's gonna be tough, especially convincing people.

843
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
First off, I don't know, it'll be tough.

844
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I just need to really see more of the game before I can really make a call.

845
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I gotta play the game, see some reviews, see some trailers that aren't just cut scenes.

846
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Oh, you skeptic.

847
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
No, I mean, I just love Dragon Quest VIII.

848
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Oh my god, that game was so fucking good on the PlayStation, but, you know, I just...

849
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
We'll see.

850
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Again, if it's worth the pain.

851
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
But it sounds like there's gonna be still at least a full single-player game,

852
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
and that part I kinda like, at least.

853
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I mean, Phantasy Star Universe is the same way.

854
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yeah, if it's got that, then that's fine.

855
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Then it's worth a purchase, because then you don't have to play the online portion of it.

856
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And if they're gonna go the whole Phantasy Star online route, then that's fine.

857
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:43,000
But it's just if they're going just an MMO route, that's gonna be a difficult sell.

858
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Alright, well, let's see if this is going to be a difficult sell to people.

859
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's basically been confirmed by Nintendo that it is true.

860
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Some of the rumors that were rumbling last week and the week before is playing out.

861
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And you can thank Famitsu Magazine for leaking an earlier picture of this.

862
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It is a 3DS circle pad attachment.

863
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:11,000
The 3DS will plug into this kind of, it looks like a docking bay sort of thing that has, yes, another analog stick on the right-hand side.

864
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Along with this announcement came an announcement that they are making Monster Hunter tri-G on the 3DS,

865
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
which, you know, requires a second analog controller just the way the game is.

866
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So now it's kind of confusing is, did they do this circle attachment just to get the Monster Hunter game,

867
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
or is this the future of the 3DS right here?

868
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And so, you know, a lot of early adopters of the system, now, at least I can speak myself, now I'm getting a little pissed.

869
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Like, I wasn't pissed when they cut the price.

870
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I especially wasn't pissed when they said, we're gonna cut the price and to help ease the pain, we're gonna throw you 20 free virtual console games.

871
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Cool, fine, I'm fine.

872
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:58,000
But now that my original 3DS may be just kind of now irrelevant and I'm gonna have to buy this extra attachment for it,

873
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
if I have to buy, I mean, I don't know if I would play a Monster Hunter game,

874
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
but if this ends up being the norm, which I worry it could be?

875
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
They're, they're obviously, I mean, if Nintendo's making a peripheral for this game,

876
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
and I know Monster Hunter's gonna be big in Japan, it's if it even comes out over here,

877
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
if they're making a peripheral for this, you better damn well believe that it's gonna be used for something other than just one game.

878
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I mean, why even bother if it's gonna be for just one game?

879
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And yeah, as you said, the cost thing, you didn't give me free games because you dropped the price of the system,

880
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
you know what, you didn't even have to do that, because I understand the price is gonna drop,

881
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
yeah, it was a little bit sooner than I had thought, but whatever, you know what, that's so bad, too well.

882
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Whatever, so I bought the system back in March, I had it a few months with no games,

883
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
and you know, you dropped it and it gave me some free virtual console games, which I've not played.

884
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And, you know, that's fine, but this is gonna split your user base in half now.

885
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Now, this is great, because now everyone thinks that the system is gonna be redesigned, whether it is or not,

886
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and all the people that are thinking about, hey, you know, I really need to pick up a 3DS this holiday

887
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
to pick up some, you know, Mario and Mario Kart games and stuff like that,

888
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
and whatever else they have coming for the 3DS, people are gonna wait.

889
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
It's gonna be interesting to see what Nintendo says to this press conference,

890
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
because I'm looking at our chatroom, of course, it's lighting up on this story, chat.orangelandradio.com,

891
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
if you want to join us live. Zether in chat says, as of now, that add-on is only for Monster Hunter tri-G.

892
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And I'm kind of going, okay, yeah, as of now, but there's certainly that skeptic in me that's saying,

893
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
but now that that's out there, who else might use it?

894
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Now, granted, just because the peripheral exists doesn't mean everybody's gonna use it,

895
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
like I think of, okay, that Metroid pinball game had that rumble pack in the DS, remember that thing?

896
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
That was a real flash in the pan, right? And I don't think any other games really used it.

897
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Yeah, there's a bunch of games that used it.

898
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Were there? Huh, I thought there were like one or two.

899
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Not a lot, but that thing right there, though, that's not necessary to play the game.

900
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Rumble, eh, whatever, so my system doesn't rumble. That's not a big deal.

901
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
None of them do nowadays anyways.

902
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
But a second analog stick is kind of important. That's like saying, oh, you know, we added some buttons.

903
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
In fact, that does add a couple shoulder buttons to the thing as well, and a trigger, I think.

904
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So that's a big deal, because now you have dual analogs,

905
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
so you could do first-person shooters on that system quite well now.

906
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I do want to point out it is not only adding a second analog stick. I haven't mentioned this.

907
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
There's also going to be shoulder buttons on it.

908
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And what's also interesting that some have pointed out,

909
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:42,000
this little docking bay now will make your 3DS match the configuration of a Wii U controller.

910
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Not saying that it can serve as a replacement for a Wii U controller yet,

911
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,000
but some folks are going, isn't that interesting that now it matches the configuration of a Wii U controller?

912
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And could it be all this call about, gee, what do you mean the system's only going to come with one Wii U controller

913
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
and we're not going to buy a second controller separately?

914
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Could this be the path we're going down?

915
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Yep. That's exactly what they're doing.

916
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Because you know when that controller first came out,

917
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
listen to the episodes of OLR leading up to the reveal of the Wii U,

918
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
because it's very interesting, because we were theorizing and theorizing,

919
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
and then all of a sudden it just kind of dawned on us that, duh,

920
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
everything we have heard about this was clearly just the Wii U controller is a freaking DS without the top screen.

921
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
That's what the Wii U controller is. And a few more buttons.

922
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Well, here's your few more buttons now. It's very interesting,

923
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
and this Nintendo conference that's coming up, what, tomorrow?

924
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Going to be very interesting.

925
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So, I just can't wait to hear their rational-

926
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I just- I want to see if they only announce the Monster Hunter thing for this,

927
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
or if they say a new Pokemon game, and the Pokemon game's going to use two analog sticks too,

928
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
because then it's over, all the games are using it.

929
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
It's not just one game. I mean, come on, it's a peripheral that, you know,

930
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I think a lot of developers would be like,

931
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
hey, that's awesome, now we don't have to do some crazy control scheme with the touch screen or whatever.

932
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I mean, it would make a lot of games easy to port over.

933
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Especially stuff that they're going to be doing on the Vita,

934
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and then porting over to the 3DS and stuff like that, it would make it a lot easier.

935
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
But, at the same time, you should have fucking thought of this when you're designing your system.

936
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Hey, I don't know, let's see, there's the PSP.

937
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
What was the number one bitch about the PSP?

938
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
It doesn't have a fucking second analog stick.

939
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
What'd you think, hey, you know what, maybe people want a second analog stick.

940
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Huh, could that be possibly what people want, since they're saying I want a second analog stick.

941
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Nah, that's not what they want, they just want one analog stick.

942
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
That's what we're going to do, we're just going to leave them with just one analog stick.

943
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Oh damn, you know, a big game comes out that needs a second analog stick.

944
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Ah, crap, we better make another adjustment to this.

945
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Yeah, I'd be pissed even if it isn't an accessory or whatever.

946
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Not only does it make it, you know, how the fuck am I supposed to carry that around with me now?

947
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
It's not going to fucking fit in my pocket.

948
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Now, again, we have to really wait until after Nintendo makes the official announcement,

949
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
because I think it's still, even though we have the picture and everything,

950
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
it's still too early to say what the point of this is.

951
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Is this a Monster Hunter add-on or is this, we don't know.

952
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
But we're all looking at it going, gosh, it makes your 3DS look like a Wii U controller,

953
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
yeah, a lot of people want to have that second analog stick,

954
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
we've heard rumors about a 3DS redesign anyway,

955
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
it would all add up, this is probably happening.

956
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I kind of akin this to, and I see some folks in chat are talking about,

957
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
well not every peripheral goes on forever, like the e-reader, printer and so forth,

958
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and I go, and none of these are ever required, but then I go,

959
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
but what about the Wii Plus motion thing?

960
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Wii Motion Plus.

961
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Wii Motion Plus didn't come out until later,

962
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
and now it's like if you want to play the new Zelda game, you have to have it.

963
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So it would not be unheard of for Nintendo to require this in the future.

964
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
This is more along the lines of Wii Motion Plus than it is the e-reader.

965
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
E-reader, those are all gimmicky things that weren't necessary, like the rumble pack.

966
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
That's not necessary to play a DS game, it was just a gimmicky thing.

967
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
The e-reader was actually a really kind of cool idea, I gotta say.

968
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
It was a cool idea, but it was still a gimmick.

969
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
You could have done something else, you know, to...

970
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
How awesome was it to have an old school NES game on five cards in your pocket?

971
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That was kind of cool, I'm sorry.

972
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Yeah, it's pretty cool, but at the same time though, this is another analog stick.

973
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:41,000
This is adding another joystick. This is very significant.

974
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And it's a few extra buttons on there, which by the way,

975
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
it's kind of interesting now that I think of it,

976
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
it's probably gonna use that IR port that's on the back of that fucking 3DS

977
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
that everyone's like, what the hell's this IR port for?

978
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Great.

979
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
But, it's just...

980
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Alright.

981
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I mean, we've got more stories to talk about, you know, the 3DS and...

982
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Well, let me bring some of these up real quick.

983
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
3DS, obviously the price cut happened and a lot of you are very happy about it.

984
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
How many of you are happy about it?

985
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Over 260% are buying this now than were before.

986
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
3DS sold 185,000 units between the price cut and the month's end.

987
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
That's a 260% increase over that same time period in July.

988
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
So it does mean that this has motivated sales a little more

989
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
and this is a trend that's gonna continue through Christmas, guaranteed.

990
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I still think, especially now that the Vita's not around this Christmas,

991
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
this thing's gonna sell like crazy over the holidays.

992
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Despite all this other crap we're talking about.

993
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Soccer moms don't know about... Soccer moms are not reading Famitsu magazine in Japan.

994
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I honestly think that the whole thing with the 3DS was really very carefully planned.

995
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
They knew they didn't have a good thing out quite yet

996
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
but at least at the higher price anyway with the intention of dropping the price

997
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
because they knew it would...

998
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I mean, sales would happen after a price drop.

999
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I don't think so.

1000
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I kinda actually disagree because I think Nintendo saw the reception at E3

1001
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
and was like, holy shit, we've struck gold with this thing.

1002
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
We gotta get it out now.

1003
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And they put it out in some ways too soon.

1004
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,000
But where I will hit is that I think the strategy all along was a build up to Christmas.

1005
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I think they released it at the end of the fiscal year to pad the low sales a wee

1006
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
and then it's gonna just...

1007
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
The price drop, on the other hand, I don't think that was planned.

1008
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
No, because if they were planning on doing...

1009
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Well, no one plans on dropping the price of that.

1010
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I mean, they've gotta be selling at a loss now.

1011
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,000
And if they weren't selling at a loss and they had that much of a margin in there,

1012
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
they could have fit a second fuckin' analog stick in there.

1013
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I mean, an analog stick doesn't cost hardly anything.

1014
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It's maybe $10 to put in that system.

1015
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I doubt it's even $10.

1016
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I've bought replacements for my PSP.

1017
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
The 3DS production cost is $101 per unit.

1018
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Wow.

1019
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So, including overhead...

1020
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
They're probably still pulling a profit on it.

1021
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So they could have charged $10 extra dollars in what they're charging now

1022
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
and added a second analog stick all along.

1023
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And you know what?

1024
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Hey, guess what, Nintendo?

1025
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
It's a good thing to have things on your system,

1026
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
like say a second analog stick that,

1027
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
yeah, you know what, you may not have a use for it right now,

1028
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
but publishers would probably want that.

1029
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
You know, it makes development of games a little bit easier.

1030
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
There's some funky right analog stick using the touch screen.

1031
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I find this fascinating, one other little thing about the DS family,

1032
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
because this is about DSi XL, which is still out, still selling,

1033
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
at the same price as the 3DS.

1034
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I was at Fry's today, and Salacious Pop really wants a DSi XL,

1035
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
because, you know, he has a lot of DS games and he just kind of wants one.

1036
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I'm not going to question if somebody wants something.

1037
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
You know, and has been talking about it,

1038
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
but it's the same price as the 3DS right now, which I find fascinating.

1039
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
And it's not dead.

1040
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It's far from it.

1041
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
They've just announced that on September 18th there will be a metallic rose DSi XL.

1042
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
It's fucking pink.

1043
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It's a fucking pink DSi, and it's coming out on September 18th.

1044
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
You know what, I kind of want it.

1045
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
In the same way that I wanted my pink advance that I have the afterburner in,

1046
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I kind of want this now.

1047
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I mean, you know, whatever.

1048
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
The DSi XL, you know, the screens are really big, it's kind of nice, whatever,

1049
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
but it is weird that it's the same price as the 3DS.

1050
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
That's a little weird to me.

1051
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
DS Lite, by the way, are still on shelves.

1052
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
There's a really pretty blue one.

1053
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
99 bucks for DS Lite.

1054
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
That's interesting to me.

1055
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Huh, all right.

1056
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I don't get empty.

1057
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
You know what, these people that buy this pink system that's coming out,

1058
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
the same price as the 3DS,

1059
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
you deserve all those high-priced games and shit.

1060
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
All right, well, we're going to revisit all of this again next week

1061
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
because the Nintendo press conference is happening in a couple days,

1062
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
and who knows what curveballs are going to come out of that.

1063
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
There could be that.

1064
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I mean, if a Pokémon game is announced, good lord, it's...

1065
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
They already have a Pokémon game.

1066
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
What Pokémon game would...

1067
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Not 3D.

1068
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I'm sorry, yes, they have a Pokémon, but it's a Pokémon...

1069
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
It's like Pokémon Snap.

1070
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Pokémon Snap is not really a Pokémon game, you know what I mean?

1071
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Like, they need a Pokémon magenta, and Pokémon...

1072
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
There's no Pokémon game that's going to need a second analog stick.

1073
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Maybe you just haven't thought of it yet.

1074
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
A Pokémon first-person shooter.

1075
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
That would be all sorts of lame.

1076
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
No, that would be awesome, are you kidding?

1077
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
No, it would be stupid.

1078
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Pokémon first-person shooter, wasn't that pretty much Pokémon Snap?

1079
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Pretty much.

1080
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Because you're shooting from a first-person perspective.

1081
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Oh, get out.

1082
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
You know what, no, I agree.

1083
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It was a first-person shooter.

1084
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
You just shot photos of them and not, you know,

1085
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
shooting them dead with bullets into their, you know, cute little fuzzy heads.

1086
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I'm just saying Goldeneye would have been that much better

1087
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
if it was Pikachu killing people.

1088
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Just saying.

1089
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

1090
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Dark Sakura.

1091
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
How about Crytek?

1092
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Fail.

1093
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Um, one of their, I guess, former employees decided

1094
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
that they were going to go off on Tumblr.

1095
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
There's an anonymous account which I took the liberty

1096
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
of reblogging everything on our Tumblr.

1097
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Hint, hint, hint.

1098
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Orangelangeradio.tumblr.com.

1099
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:34,000
And, basically, he's listing this whole, just crazy line of stuff

1100
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
that, you know, they've done that's illegal.

1101
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Going over this, he said, I'm going to read a little bit.

1102
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
From the outside, Crytek produces some of the most graphically pleasing games around.

1103
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Those being Far Cry, Crysis, Crysis, Warhead, and Crysis 2.

1104
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Four games in ten years.

1105
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
The work of the individuals should be proud of what they've done.

1106
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But they've basically said that there's a bullying mentality given at the CEO levels.

1107
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Where they're delivered lines like, you should be proud to work for Crytek,

1108
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
yet demanding six months of crunch time due to project management failures.

1109
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
This caused certain members of staff to suffer both in medical and personal ways.

1110
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And he's listing, alright, this polluted the work atmosphere that resulted in the resignation

1111
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
and or unlawful firing of global talent manager, global head of resourceful humans,

1112
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
lead game designer, lead community manager, community manager, lead researcher,

1113
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,000
storyboard and concept artist, and a whole list of developers and designers.

1114
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And, so basically, the article, you know, he's just there on Tumblr pretty much blasting them.

1115
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I mean, nothing really specifically listed, just said that a lot of senior staff was made redundant

1116
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,000
and that employees were, quote, allowed to work longer hours and weekend days.

1117
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Which, again, Crytek's a German developer in violation of German law.

1118
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Now, the co-founder, Avni Yearly, said, and he spoke with Develop about these practices

1119
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
and said that they were misleading accusations and, quote,

1120
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
is very distressing for us to think that an individual thinks we've been treating them unfairly.

1121
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
It's very disappointing. So, I actually found a rebuttal on the same Tumblr.

1122
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And he goes on saying, as previously mentioned, we do not aim to mislead or give erroneous opinions

1123
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
as this would ultimately decrease the strength on which the blog was first created.

1124
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And it is nothing but bring into doubt the levels of truth featured within.

1125
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So, he said, if German labor codes were being met and strictly adhered to,

1126
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:44,000
there would be no need for the successful court cases against Crytek GmbH in which a company lawyer was present.

1127
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Crytek, if you can provide proof that no one has ever successfully claimed compensation due to an illegal firing,

1128
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
then please do so. You cannot.

1129
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And, so basically, just going on. You can read this all if you want to.

1130
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I've linked them both on our Tumblr. But it's, like, it really goes long.

1131
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
And he's talking, just, this is clearly somebody who was there.

1132
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It's one of those cases where I think you go, okay, you know, you read this and you go,

1133
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
well, another person complaining about the development industry, what a shock.

1134
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:22,000
It's probably true. But then you look at it and you go, well, he probably does have a lot of bitterness issues.

1135
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Obviously, something happened there.

1136
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
None of this reads like anyone bitter.

1137
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I just, I still think the answer's probably in the middle somewhere.

1138
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
It's probably, you know, and I think I just said this two weeks ago on the show in a very similar story.

1139
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:39,000
There's your side of the story, my side of the story, and the truth somewhere in the middle.

1140
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
It's probably what's happening here, too.

1141
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Well, there's another line on here, though, that I think is a very good point.

1142
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Enforcing weekend work and expecting them to come in are two different things.

1143
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
As an employee, you know that if you aren't showing the drive and ambition to become a team player,

1144
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
your direct line manager may take a negative stance on your progression in the company.

1145
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
So basically, it's talking about the impact it has on home life, on employee well-being,

1146
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
which is actually something that I think is a big problem here in the U.S., to be perfectly honest.

1147
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
But I don't, I really don't read any bitterness into any of this.

1148
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:17,000
This is someone who loved his job or her job and was proud of the work that they did

1149
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:25,000
and found that the entire, just from reading the whole thing, found that the work environment is what soured it.

1150
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:31,000
They're very proud of their work, very proud of what they did, but it was all environmental.

1151
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Well, it'll be interesting to see if this anonymous person is forced to reveal themselves later on or what happens.

1152
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I just want to end it with the last line.

1153
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,000
We make and made great games, and we just want to see the atmosphere and blatant disregard for employee morale improve.

1154
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
All right.

1155
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
So, more power to you. Good luck.

1156
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Let's move on.

1157
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:57,000
All right. So, we talked a little bit about Ubisoft and their different DRM that they're going to have for upcoming games.

1158
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:07,000
One of the first ones that was going to take place on console was this new Uplay Passport thing that they were doing with Driver San Francisco.

1159
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Problem was, it didn't quite go as planned.

1160
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Driver San Francisco on Xbox 360 was supposed to include a Uplay Passport code required to access multiplayer beyond a 48 hour trial period.

1161
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:29,000
However, they forgot to put the codes in many of the copies that went out.

1162
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Brilliant work.

1163
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Yes. So, what ended up happening, and this is only really in North America.

1164
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,000
What ended up happening, though, is the people that bought it, you can actually get the Passport for free.

1165
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
You just either sign in and there's two options.

1166
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:56,000
There's one to start my two day free trial, which will not expire now, or select Uplay Passport Purchase, which will be provided at no charge.

1167
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:05,000
So, if you wanted to right now, you could purchase that game for, you know, used or whatever and still get online for free.

1168
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Because they fucked up.

1169
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
So basically the whole thing just went out the window.

1170
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yes, on the Xbox 360 at least. Still going on the Playstation 3, because they didn't forget that one.

1171
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
But, Xbox 360 at least, they forgot.

1172
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Well, that's nice and fair.

1173
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:28,000
And, surprisingly, the game got pretty good reviews. I didn't think it would be that well, but it did alright.

1174
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Also, From Dust on PC had that wonderful online, you have to be always online in order to play the game.

1175
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Well, now they have a patch that removes that DRM.

1176
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
So, the title can be played in offline mode as well now.

1177
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I guess a follow up to that had come up a couple weeks ago.

1178
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I know that some people were pissed that an extra layer of DRM was added to the Steam version.

1179
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Not cool.

1180
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Alright, well, moving on to a story about Xbox and some bans going on on Xbox Live.

1181
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Apparently, Xbox has actually put out a statement this week that they did ban quite a few users this week.

1182
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
And it was a result of, theft was the keyword they used.

1183
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:23,000
The company, quote, discovered users who were illegitimately accessed Xbox Live Marketplace downloadable content.

1184
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:29,000
This access was intentional and not accidental, constituting a blatant violation of the terms of use for the service.

1185
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
But they won't give any more specifics about what's going on.

1186
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I guess it's known around the internet that there are some ways that you can steal the stuff and Microsoft is finally clamped down on it.

1187
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It's not entirely stealing, but yeah, there is a way.

1188
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
What do you mean it's not entirely stealing?

1189
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:58,000
It has to do with different profiles. People basically importing a profile over downloading that content and then, you know, it's basically recovering a profile.

1190
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Oh, it's like content sharing.

1191
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Yes.

1192
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I wonder if somebody did that when my account was hacked.

1193
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Because you know I have a lot of games.

1194
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Yeah.

1195
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
So I wonder if they did that.

1196
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Basically, it's recovering a profile. So you have like people made certain profiles, say they bought like Grand Theft Auto as a games on demand thing.

1197
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:27,000
And so what happens is you recover that profile and you can put it on your system and you can play offline, you know, without that profile and you know, because it's on your system.

1198
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
At least I think that's how we're never tried it.

1199
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I want to say that there's got to be some type of hack that goes there because like for instance, when my one 360 red ringed and I had to get another, I put on the hard drive with all my old games on it.

1200
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And if I wasn't connected to the internet, my game would show up as a demo at first, but then it would turn into the real game after I was like signed in.

1201
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
So I think something happens there where it's just the demo version, but when Xbox Live talks to it.

1202
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
So I'm not sure how they're pulling that off. There's got to be something a little shady there.

1203
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I was hoping at first that this meant they caught the people that were stealing all the people's money, but I guess it doesn't sound like that.

1204
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And Microsoft still has not said anything about that.

1205
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:18,000
No, they, in fact, there's a forum I browse all the time that had a section where they were swapping games like that and it's gone.

1206
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:24,000
That whole forum section is no longer, which I'm guessing they just banned everybody.

1207
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Nice.

1208
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Yeah.

1209
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Alright, so this is one of those cases where you don't want to share.

1210
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Maginomicon in our chat says, I wonder if that also applies to the free Fable 2 glitch that happened a few months ago.

1211
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I seem to remember that. I don't think so.

1212
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
No.

1213
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
No, because that was a legitimate mistake on Microsoft's part that a lot of people went in and just took advantage of.

1214
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
But at the end of the day, that was Microsoft's fault for leaving that switch open.

1215
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
People weren't like hacking their consoles or going around to get it.

1216
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
They had put it up on the marketplace for free.

1217
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
It was kind of their own damn fault.

1218
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
They were mad, but, you know, be mad at whoever did that.

1219
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Don't be mad at the people who took advantage of it.

1220
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
So, alright.

1221
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Alright, moving on.

1222
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Dark Soccer, why don't you move on to the next story for us?

1223
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Yeah.

1224
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Okay, the next story actually has to do with Pinball FX.

1225
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,000
This is the developer says that Microsoft is pretty okay in their book.

1226
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Basically, it's kind of putting down on team meat for what they said, putting down Microsoft.

1227
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And there's a quote on here from Millkirk, who is then studio's vice president of marketing.

1228
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
It says, they totally have the right to talk about it.

1229
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
It's terrible they had a bad experience like that, but where we're coming from, when is enough enough?

1230
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Let it go already.

1231
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,000
So basically, they're just like, why are you trying to put them down?

1232
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:59,000
We're not trying to discredit that you've had a bad time from this, but that it's time to get over it, time to move on.

1233
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And so they're apparently sniping back and forth like children.

1234
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
It was interesting to read.

1235
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I don't know if the tweets are still up, but they're archived around on the internet somewhere, I'm sure.

1236
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And it was really one of those cases where I read it and I went, really? Like people don't think more about the fact that everybody is watching these two companies fight?

1237
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
It wasn't very flattering for either one, I think.

1238
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,000
But there was obviously a lot of very, it's like anybody who fights on Twitter or on Facebook or whatever.

1239
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,000
It's just emotions are running high, so you don't think before you click post and then later you sort of regret it.

1240
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:42,000
But it was nice to see that it all ended with a, you know, how about a super meat boy skin for pinball or whatever they had said at the end that they kissed, made up, cuddled.

1241
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Well, yeah, well, it's even says on here that, you know, they're like good for them, they had a good time, you know, that's great for them.

1242
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Right.

1243
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I mean, that's what the meat boy people said.

1244
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Mm hmm.

1245
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
So, I mean, it's working out in the end.

1246
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
But you should have seen the tweets because the tweets were the equivalent of fuck you, you fucking fuck.

1247
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Like, that's really how they read to me.

1248
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Oh, like I said, children.

1249
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Yeah.

1250
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
So, but it's like someone smacked them on the hand and said, now make nice.

1251
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Well, those are, well, this is the internet, you guys look dumb right now.

1252
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Well, and they're two great games too.

1253
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Yeah.

1254
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I love both those games, pinball FX2 and meat boys.

1255
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It was kind of sad.

1256
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
It's like watching your friends fight and you're just sitting there helpless.

1257
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You can't do anything about it.

1258
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
You know what I mean?

1259
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I know how that feels.

1260
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I know.

1261
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
There you go.

1262
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Alright, let's move on.

1263
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Travel the world and check out some release dates.

1264
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
What is coming out to a console near you?

1265
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Loki, let's start in the US.

1266
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
The US is actually, well, it's still continuing on with quite a few games coming out.

1267
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Starting on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, we have NHL 12 coming from EA.

1268
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Also this week, was it from Twisted Pixel?

1269
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
The Gun Stringer for Kinect.

1270
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And of course you get, was it Fruit Ninja Kinect in there as well.

1271
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,000
So if you're interested in those games, that's this week.

1272
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
White Knight Chronicles 2 is coming out this week as well.

1273
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
That also includes the first game that's on Playstation 3.

1274
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Camping Mama, Outdoors Adventure on Nintendo DS.

1275
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Yes, she is still making games about different things other than cooking.

1276
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
New Cooking Mama coming out later this year.

1277
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Thor, God of Thunder on the 3DS.

1278
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
It was basically the same version as the ones back in May, but now for the 3DS.

1279
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Deck of Sports Extreme coming out for the 3DS.

1280
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Bit.Trip Saga, which is the collection of all the Bit.Trip games.

1281
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
That's on the 3DS this week as well.

1282
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Puzzler Mind Gym on the 3DS.

1283
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Bit.Trip Complete, which is on the Wii, and that also includes the soundtrack for the game as well.

1284
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Call of Juarez the Cartel on PC.

1285
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Red Orchestra 2, Heroes of Stalingrad on PC.

1286
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Nicktoons MLB, that's on the Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

1287
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,000
The God of War Origins collection on PS3 coming out this week.

1288
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Pooka Power Up, that's on Nintendo DS.

1289
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Aren't Pookas the little guys in Dig Dug?

1290
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Oh, no.

1291
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Oh, Pooka P-U-C-C, I was thinking P-O-O-K-A.

1292
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Is it P-U-C-C-A?

1293
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Yeah.

1294
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
That's like the candy.

1295
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Well, when I heard it, I thought Dig Dug.

1296
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Silly English language.

1297
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Emily the Strange Strangress on the Nintendo DS.

1298
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
There's some Dual Packs coming out for the PSP.

1299
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I don't know what I'm aware of here.

1300
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Mega Man Dual Pack, I believe that's Mega Man Power Up Legends and Mega Man...

1301
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
There is a Mega Man X game as well.

1302
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
That's on PSP.

1303
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Then Monster Hunter Freedom Dual Pack, that's the two Monster Hunter Freedom games that were out on the PSP over here.

1304
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
And that is it.

1305
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there.

1306
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,000
On the Xbox 360 on September 15th, Dunamis 15 is coming out.

1307
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:21,000
That is not a series I recognize over here, but it is an adventure game that's coming out on the 15th.

1308
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I don't think it's actually the 15th game in a series, but you do get bikini-clad anime girls as part of it.

1309
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Actually, she's wearing a little bra.

1310
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
They're kind of cute.

1311
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I don't know what type of game this is.

1312
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Probably another type of sim game, but it looks like it has these mystery elements.

1313
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I need to stop trying to guess what these games are, because I'm probably getting it horrifically wrong.

1314
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
But it is kind of fun to guess.

1315
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Otherwise, though, probably not a game we're going to get over here.

1316
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
So that's really it on the 360 this week.

1317
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Going to the PlayStation 3, they're getting that same game, and that's really it on the PlayStation 3.

1318
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
There's some more stuff coming next week, just so you guys know.

1319
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And then going to the handhelds real quick.

1320
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Trying to pull up the PSP releases here.

1321
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
God Eater Burst gets a price reduction.

1322
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Otherwise, as far as new games go, there's Gekka, Rioran, Romance comes out from Idea Factory this week.

1323
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,000
And this game, it looks like it could be based off an anime.

1324
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I'm not sure.

1325
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I just know one of these screenshots says,

1326
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Dessert, Prohibited Fruits Scenario.

1327
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:32,000
So apparently, there's no no fruits in this game.

1328
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I don't really know how else to say that.

1329
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Prohibited Fruits Scenario is an awesome band name.

1330
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Right?

1331
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
And on the 3DS this week, nothing.

1332
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Nothing on the 3DS.

1333
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
But next week, Frogger, Loki's favorite.

1334
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
So that's it.

1335
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Next week is going to pick up a little more in Japan.

1336
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
But for right now, really nothing else.

1337
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Dark Sakura!

1338
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Well, in other news, this is of course coming out in the UK.

1339
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,000
On the 13th, we have Hard Reset and Red Orchestra, Heroes of Stalingrad.

1340
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:09,000
And on the 14th, we have From Dust, Radiant Silvergun for Xbox Live Arcade, Renegade Ops, TrackMania 2.

1341
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
And on the 15th, Moto Heroes.

1342
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Alrighty.

1343
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

1344
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Then we got the classic game of the week.

1345
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
But first, Loki.

1346
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Yes.

1347
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Infinity Ward is going to get their day in court next year in May on the 7th.

1348
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:33,000
This is, of course, the whole trial where they were suing Activision for royalties unpaid.

1349
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
They're seeking $125 million in unpaid royalties from the sales of Modern Warfare 2.

1350
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And also wish to reclaim their contractual rights to the Modern Warfare brand.

1351
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Can you imagine if they win that?

1352
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
That's going to be some interesting shit right there.

1353
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I don't think they're going to.

1354
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I'm excited one of these is finally going to court.

1355
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Like, we always hear settle, settle, settle, settle, settle.

1356
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
But like now, oh man, Michael Jackson popcorn eating gift.

1357
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
You know which one I'm talking about, right?

1358
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
You've seen that animated file.

1359
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
That's going to be me while this thing's in the courtroom.

1360
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Because even though this isn't a series I'm a big huge fan of, I'm, I'm, I'm excited to see somebody do battle with Activision.

1361
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It's going to be interesting.

1362
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Any bets?

1363
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I don't think there's bets on the court.

1364
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I don't think they're going to get.

1365
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
They probably will get their royalties.

1366
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I don't know if they're going to get the Modern Warfare 2 stuff.

1367
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
And even if they did, they just renamed the damn franchise.

1368
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Right.

1369
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
I don't think they're going to get the same thing though.

1370
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Call of Heroes.

1371
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
No, they'll still be Call of Duty.

1372
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
It'll just be, you know.

1373
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Modernized Warness or something.

1374
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Warfare Modern.

1375
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Exactly.

1376
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Well, Sony created a new job this week.

1377
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:53,000
They hired a chief information security officer, which probably makes sense considering, oh, you know, they had that huge information breach earlier this year when their system got hacked.

1378
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Well, they're not fucking around with who they've hired for the position.

1379
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
They have hired a former US Homeland Security official.

1380
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,000
It's Phillip Teitinger is the new chief information security officer at PlayStation Network.

1381
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
No word as to exactly what that person does.

1382
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,000
However, what I'm assuming is that he's going to make sure that system never gets hacked again.

1383
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Because if it does get hacked again, they'll probably hire someone new instead.

1384
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
So, yep.

1385
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Apparently, he's not just that, but he's also going to be a senior vice president.

1386
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:28,000
So, I imagine he'll have a say in some of the higher level goings ons of the companies.

1387
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
He will be reporting to an executive VP in the company.

1388
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:46,000
And, of course, Sony is making no really hold backs saying that they are confirming that it's because of the PSN breach saying, quote, we are looking to bolster our network security even further.

1389
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
So, they are going to make sure that doesn't happen again.

1390
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Because if it does happen again, it's going to be really, really bad for everybody.

1391
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Alright, let's go back to a simpler time when the systems weren't being hacked.

1392
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And our credit card information wasn't saved on the console.

1393
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Remember when we had consoles and we didn't have to put our credit cards right on?

1394
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Remember when your consoles didn't have the memory capacity to save anything?

1395
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Exactly.

1396
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Well, I think this week's classic game did have a memory capacity of some sort.

1397
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
But not on the console.

1398
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
It was about 16 blocks big. That was it.

1399
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Yeah.

1400
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
So, let's take a trip down memory lane with a segment we always do.

1401
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
The classic game of the week.

1402
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the gaming vault head first and pull out a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be re-experiencing this game all over again.

1403
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I got to say, this week is kind of one of those weeks where you go, really? Dark Soccer has been doing this for about 150 weeks and she never did this game?

1404
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Kind of on purpose, but this morning's conversation over breakfast really inspired.

1405
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
So, what is the classic game of the week that surprisingly has never come up before?

1406
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
It's Final Fantasy VII.

1407
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Final Fantasy VII came out, well, it started development in 1994 and it was supposed to be on the SNES and then to the Nintendo 64.

1408
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:14,000
But when PlayStation came out, they hopped right on it because the Nintendo 64 couldn't handle the storage.

1409
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:21,000
It was designed and produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi and the music was by Uematsu, which we all know.

1410
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,000
But this is the first one that Yoshitaka Amano didn't do the character designs for.

1411
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
It was done by Tetsuya Nomura.

1412
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,000
So, this is one of my favorite games of all time for the record, I would say.

1413
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:43,000
So basically, you're this emo boy named Cloud with his hair in his face and he goes around being pissed off and not so talkative.

1414
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And he runs into this whole bag named Aerith and this really cute girl named Tifa, who's really sweet and nice.

1415
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:58,000
And then kind of a vampire-y dude named Vincent who you find in a coffin.

1416
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Well, my team freaking had Vincent all the damn time.

1417
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And Yuffie? Yuffie was fun and she had the Conformer?

1418
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Can I for real say the first time I played through this game, I never got Vincent.

1419
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I didn't even know he was in the game because the internet wasn't really around the back then.

1420
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
I mean, it was, but nobody used it like they do now.

1421
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:26,000
You know, and it's, I didn't have Vincent and I had Aerith in my party as one of my main people that I would constantly use.

1422
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
So let's just say I wasn't happy by the time this two rolled around.

1423
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
I was legit, like I wasn't sad, I was fucking mad.

1424
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I have my save file still where she dies.

1425
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Spoiler, she gets ganked by Sephiroth. Ew.

1426
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I mean, a lot of people were pissed off and sad.

1427
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Look at Aerith. She's a man stealing hoe bag.

1428
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Aerith dies is kind of like the video game equivalent of Darth Vader as Luke's father.

1429
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
We all fucking know.

1430
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Yeah, but at any rate, you know, it's one of my favorite games.

1431
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I bred chocobos like you would not believe.

1432
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Yeah, you can breed chocobos and you race them and if you get the black chocobo, it can run over like the, over the mountains.

1433
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:15,000
You can get another one that runs over the oceans and then you can get the gold chocobo that runs over everything and then you get the airship.

1434
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:22,000
And there's, you know, all the little drama, the little side stories that end up like, especially with Vincent.

1435
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:29,000
You know, the whole Lucretia thing being Aerith's mom, Sephiroth's mom and a bunch of crap.

1436
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,000
But this game has some of my favorite music in it too, Rob. You should totally play.

1437
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Sure, we'll go back from the battle sound there and check out, let's see, you marked this as your favorite song.

1438
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
This is my favorite in the game.

1439
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Just a little bit of it.

1440
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
This is the first Jenova battle theme.

1441
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
This is like my favorite music in the whole damn game.

1442
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And then my second favorite is actually more Jenova music.

1443
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
The one that basically takes the battle theme and kind of redoes it.

1444
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
If you don't mind.

1445
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Sure, I'll go to that one too.

1446
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Let's see.

1447
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
And then I'll keep going with.

1448
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Here we go, here's a clip.

1449
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:14,000
It takes it so minimalist and then just makes it super dramatic.

1450
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Anyway, so you've got all these other characters.

1451
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
You've got Barret who cusses.

1452
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And Sid who has the best line in the whole game.

1453
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Is sit down in your chair and drink your goddamn tea.

1454
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Which ended up being quoted in like AOL chats for years and years and years.

1455
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And of course there's Red13 who is a kind of a lion-y looking guy.

1456
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
And CatShe which for the record that is how it's pronounced.

1457
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Because it's Celtic.

1458
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
It's not Cait Sith, it's CatShe.

1459
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Just thought I'd let you know.

1460
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I'm muddying the whole internet now.

1461
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I love Cait Sith, what are you talking about?

1462
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Who ends up being like a Tarte controlling the body and everything.

1463
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And of course there's Sephiroth because Sephiroth is what you got.

1464
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And by the way the story still makes no fucking sense to this day.

1465
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Yes it does.

1466
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Okay, because basically it's like the whole Shinra, the big corporation in charge.

1467
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Is sucking the life dry out of the planet.

1468
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
And they're using the energy to do genetic experiments.

1469
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
And they find this alien thing that lands.

1470
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
And they're using that in their experiments too.

1471
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Hence Sephiroth.

1472
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Who's fucking crazy go nuts.

1473
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
So anyway.

1474
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
He uh.

1475
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
He decides he's gonna do what Jenova came to do.

1476
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
And that's destroy every fucking thing.

1477
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And Aerith's like uh uh bitch.

1478
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Even though you know she's a hoebag.

1479
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
What?

1480
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
I got corrected by my husband.

1481
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Danny came in and said sit your ass down in that chair and drink your god damn tea.

1482
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Yes.

1483
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Um.

1484
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Which by the way I did do a little bit of a double take.

1485
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
The first time I was playing through this game and the game said shit.

1486
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I was like they can do that in games now.

1487
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Apparently.

1488
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Welcome to the Playstation.

1489
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Right.

1490
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Um so at any rate.

1491
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
For a little bit more in the development side of that.

1492
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Uh.

1493
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Basically there are a lot of people involved in this.

1494
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
This is a really big deal.

1495
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Um.

1496
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
It uh was designed on Power Animator and Soft Image 3D.

1497
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Which is early 3D.

1498
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Ooh.

1499
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
This is before my eye kids.

1500
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
You know before you could just download 3D software.

1501
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
You know.

1502
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
For fun.

1503
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
And uh.

1504
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
But they.

1505
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
The story was pretty much.

1506
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Um.

1507
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Pretty much what they had in mind for the Famicom.

1508
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
But they were able to develop it a lot more and bring the 3D in.

1509
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Um.

1510
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
They also included um previews of other games.

1511
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Um.

1512
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Basically the demo disc was a pack in with Tobol No. 1.

1513
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
In Japan.

1514
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Which Tobol No. 1 was also a good game.

1515
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
And uh had previews of Bushido Blade and Saga Frontier.

1516
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
And uh there were just lots of cool stuff.

1517
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
There was a PC version that came out um on Windows.

1518
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
But it was uh.

1519
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Really.

1520
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
And when it came out for systems at the time.

1521
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
It was really uh.

1522
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Requirement heavy.

1523
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
It really pushed systems.

1524
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
And it played really slow.

1525
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
It was.

1526
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Molasses.

1527
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Um.

1528
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Although now I've found that people have done um.

1529
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Different uh.

1530
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Patches form.

1531
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Where they have the Advent Children thing.

1532
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
There's a whole Advent Children remake.

1533
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Um.

1534
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Using the Final Fantasy 7 PC version.

1535
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
They've reskinned.

1536
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
The music.

1537
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
They've done uh.

1538
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
HD versions.

1539
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
It's pretty crazy.

1540
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And then I saw someone actually um.

1541
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Going through and using the um.

1542
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Unreal Engine to re-render whole scenes.

1543
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
And I was hoping that someone was like.

1544
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
There's a fan remake project out there too.

1545
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
But they haven't.

1546
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Uh.

1547
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Really put anything concrete out there.

1548
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
So.

1549
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I was really disappointed with that.

1550
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
But I mean.

1551
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Like.

1552
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
You've heard the music.

1553
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
It's fantastic.

1554
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I've got the soundtrack.

1555
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
It's wonderful.

1556
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Now there's um.

1557
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
A few things about this game.

1558
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
That.

1559
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
I got an old.

1560
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I have a strategy guide.

1561
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
That was based off the Japanese version.

1562
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
So I really wanted to play the Japanese version for a while.

1563
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
And so I finally got to borrow my friends.

1564
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
And there's this little thing.

1565
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I was telling you about it this morning Rob.

1566
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
These little things called Test Zero.

1567
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
That look like blocky Dobermans.

1568
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
And if you go into the gold saucer in the prison.

1569
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
And go in the well.

1570
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
They hide out in the well.

1571
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
There's three of them.

1572
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
It's a random encounter.

1573
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
And if you keep attacking them.

1574
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
And attacking and attacking and attacking and attacking.

1575
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Um.

1576
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
They will uh.

1577
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
They just beg for their life the whole time.

1578
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
And then when you kill them you get like a million experience.

1579
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
So you can like power level.

1580
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
But it's not in the US one.

1581
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I tried.

1582
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Not in the US one.

1583
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Um.

1584
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
There were.

1585
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Safe.

1586
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
There were.

1587
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
This was in the days of Dex files.

1588
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
You know.

1589
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
When you could download.

1590
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
When you had the Dex drives.

1591
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
You could download the uh.

1592
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Memory card data.

1593
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Is uh.

1594
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I got.

1595
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I always got the Tifa date.

1596
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Because I hated Aerith.

1597
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
But I downloaded like a safe file that had all the other dates.

1598
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
You could do a date with Aerith.

1599
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
The ho-bag.

1600
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
You could do a date with Barret.

1601
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And a date with Yuffie.

1602
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Which.

1603
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
The Barret date was just.

1604
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Funny.

1605
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Total bromance.

1606
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Anyway.

1607
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Um.

1608
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
And you play the whole game to find out the clouds fucking nuts.

1609
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
And Sephiroth is even crazier.

1610
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
And uh.

1611
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Aerith is dead.

1612
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Which is the best part of the game.

1613
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Um.

1614
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
But yeah.

1615
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,000
There's been rumors of Squeenix doing a remake.

1616
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
And they said they would.

1617
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
There's people who said they would love to dedicate the time to it.

1618
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
To do it with the Final Fantasy 13 style.

1619
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So basically doing it in Unreal Engine.

1620
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Um.

1621
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
There are other games related to the series.

1622
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
There's Crisis Core.

1623
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Which is basically the tale of Zax and Chibi Cloud.

1624
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And there's uh.

1625
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
George of Cerberus.

1626
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Which is a shooting game.

1627
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Well kind of first person shooter-y starring Vincent.

1628
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Which I sadly have but have not yet set down to play.

1629
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Um.

1630
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
There were the phone games.

1631
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Remember?

1632
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
What was it?

1633
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Um.

1634
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
After Crisis?

1635
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Before Crisis.

1636
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Before Crisis.

1637
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
That was it.

1638
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Yeah.

1639
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Um.

1640
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It was Before Crisis.

1641
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Um.

1642
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
And then there's any.

1643
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
There's you know.

1644
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
The Advent Children Complete.

1645
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
The DVD thing.

1646
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Which is awesome.

1647
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Actually the ending song has a cameo by Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance.

1648
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Just wanted.

1649
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Only in the Japanese version.

1650
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Which is stupid.

1651
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
But anyway.

1652
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Um.

1653
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Just one of the best games ever.

1654
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
And of course.

1655
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Um.

1656
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Amano went back and did a lot of special art.

1657
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Um.

1658
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
As promotional material for Final Fantasy 7.

1659
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
So uh.

1660
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I.

1661
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I.

1662
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
The only ones that I have of those are what's in my huge mungus Amano art book.

1663
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Um.

1664
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
But you can find them online.

1665
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
They're out there.

1666
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
And so that's Final Fantasy 7.

1667
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
It's considered.

1668
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
I mean.

1669
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I think 6 was a more solid game.

1670
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
But 7 is what sits on.

1671
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I.

1672
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I.

1673
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I'll put it this way.

1674
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I owned two games before I even had a Playstation that I could say was mine.

1675
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
One of them was Final Fantasy 7 and the other one was um.

1676
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
A Dragon Ball GT Final Bout.

1677
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Which I wish I'd kept on.

1678
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Held onto because it was worth money and I traded it for uh.

1679
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
What's that?

1680
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Blue Stinger on Dreamcast for the Japanese version.

1681
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
But that's it.

1682
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Those are the two games I owned.

1683
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Alright.

1684
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
There it is.

1685
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Your classic game of the week everybody.

1686
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Final Fantasy 7.

1687
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,000
As we listen to Dark Soccer and Dan have a fight about what they did and they didn't

1688
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
own.

1689
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Anyhow.

1690
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Uh.

1691
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
That's gonna do it for part A of Orange Lawn Studio.

1692
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
But don't go anywhere you guys.

1693
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
We're gonna come back for more of Orange Lawn Studio with part B.

1694
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Where we're gonna talk about uh.

1695
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:43,000
One internet service provider might be throttling your bandwidth when it comes to games.

1696
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Also we're gonna talk about some possible serious problems with the Wii U.

1697
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
It might not really work.

1698
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Oh shit.

1699
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
And of course rapid fire news.

1700
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Your tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r.

1701
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Your emails at mailbagatorangelawnsradio.com and your calls on the skype line.

1702
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
All when we come back with more of Orange Lawn Studio.

1703
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
But before we go to our break tonight.

1704
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I gotta say I believe Irene unfortunately is going to be leaving us.

1705
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Um. Because uh. She's uh. Got like homework and like real world stuff.

1706
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Mhm.

1707
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Geez.

1708
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
But uh. Thanks for sitting in on the show.

1709
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I'm sorry you didn't get to talk too much.

1710
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
But.

1711
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
That's okay. I talked enough.

1712
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
It's. It's nice to hear from you.

1713
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Don't be a stranger.

1714
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Sure.

1715
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Is there any uh. Parting words you want to say to our listeners tonight?

1716
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Not really. No.

1717
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Okay. Well then get out.

1718
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Bye.

1719
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I'm just kidding.

1720
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Well thanks for being here.

1721
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
And uh. Maybe we'll hear you at least if not on OLR in the future.

1722
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Maybe a future episode of Hoard House.

1723
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Or somewhere in the Orange Lounge Radio family of programming.

1724
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Indeed.

1725
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Alright.

1726
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Alright.

1727
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Alright. So. There you go.

1728
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Uh. We're going to take a break guys.

1729
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
But don't go anywhere.

1730
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1731
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1732
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
We are live on this Sunday evening.

1733
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
September the 11th of 2011.

1734
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
With the 427th episode of our show.

1735
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
And we just had a fun Part A there.

1736
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Acknowledging the fact that it is Loki's birthday today.

1737
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And if you missed that in Part A.

1738
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Uh. Irene showed up tonight.

1739
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
She's left sadly.

1740
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
But uh. She brought Loki some bacon.

1741
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Well they're not. They're bacon cupcakes.

1742
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
But basically she's.

1743
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Bacon garnished.

1744
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Bacon garnished cupcakes.

1745
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Like there's not bacon inside the cupcakes.

1746
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
But it is pretty good I guess.

1747
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
We finally dived into him during the break and ate them.

1748
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
We have a present in here now.

1749
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
So there you go.

1750
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Dan the man is here in studio joining us.

1751
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
What have you been playing lately Dan?

1752
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Dan of course. Dark Soccer's husband.

1753
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
What have you been up to?

1754
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I'm working.

1755
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
You're working? You're not playing games?

1756
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I haven't got to play many games.

1757
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
What is up with that?

1758
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Everybody's been saying that tonight.

1759
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I've been working too much to play games.

1760
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I understand though.

1761
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I know you just recently started employment again.

1762
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
And all that good stuff so.

1763
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
But that's good. That's a good thing.

1764
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I did just pick up a copy of Left 4 Dead 2.

1765
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Yeah.

1766
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
But I'm like too cheap to pay for Xbox Live.

1767
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
After getting it for free for the last six years.

1768
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Right.

1769
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
And I'm kind of like oh man.

1770
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Three months is 25 bucks?

1771
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Screw Xbox Live.

1772
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Why didn't you guys go over to PlayStation 3 then?

1773
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Because none of the people I play games with have a PlayStation 3.

1774
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
You know I um.

1775
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I apologize. I forget who said this in chat.

1776
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
It's just a question that came up and it scrolled by.

1777
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
But it was while Dark Soccer was doing the classic game of the week.

1778
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
So I couldn't bring it up.

1779
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
But to summarize the question was.

1780
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
If a game is available on multiple platforms.

1781
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Including PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

1782
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,000
What goes into your decision to decide what console you get the game on?

1783
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
And for me.

1784
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Certainly price weighs into it and bonus features and things of that sort.

1785
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,000
But it's really about like where are my friends playing?

1786
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
And most of the time if it's online they're probably on Xbox Live.

1787
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,000
But there have been games that I've bought on PlayStation 3 for the simple fact.

1788
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I am not going to use the fucking Xbox controller to play this game.

1789
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
My decision for playing some of these is who can I borrow it from?

1790
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I'm kind of the opposite. I like the 360 controller.

1791
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Really? Aw. But for some games I can't stand it.

1792
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Like Super Street Fighter 4. I bought it on the PlayStation 3 simply because.

1793
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Can't fucking stand the Xbox 360 controller for fighters.

1794
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
That's why God made arcade sticks.

1795
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Yeah but I don't want to buy an arcade stick.

1796
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Yes you do.

1797
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I kind of do. You're right.

1798
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Told ya.

1799
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
There are some games I would like to play with an arcade joystick.

1800
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Alright so Left 4 Dead 2. I'm going to get back into that.

1801
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I guess you've got some friends.

1802
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I've never really started on that. I played like the demo.

1803
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I've liked both Left 4 Deads and I was always like.

1804
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Yeah it's like a first person shooter.

1805
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Seems like it might be kind of cool if I was playing with other people.

1806
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
But it's no fun to play by yourself.

1807
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,000
I've watched Salacious Pop play a little bit of that and it looks interesting.

1808
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
But I tried to play it and I am fucking terrible at it.

1809
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,000
It's easy to find more people that have it in the system link.

1810
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
It's such a team based game. I just bring the team down.

1811
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Well the problem is one of the people we're going to play with is in Washington.

1812
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,000
We don't have that long of an ethernet cable.

1813
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,000
If anyone has an 800 mile ethernet cable, hook it up.

1814
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Actually X-Link Kai. You can do that.

1815
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
That's system link over the internet.

1816
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Oh yeah like the game spy tunnel thing they used to do.

1817
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Yeah.

1818
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Nice.

1819
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:16,000
The one component that I have a hard time defining when I would buy a game for is the PC.

1820
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Because I'm kind of like.

1821
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Oh PC games are usually pretty niche.

1822
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
And a lot of times the games I buy on the PC are only on the PC.

1823
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Diablo 3 would be a good example.

1824
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Although it's very likely Diablo 3 is coming to console.

1825
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I'm not going to wait for it.

1826
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I want it when it fucking comes out.

1827
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
And I bought Starcraft 2 on PC.

1828
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I bought Civilization 5 on PC.

1829
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Those games only exist on PC.

1830
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:46,000
The cross platform stuff, I tend to gravitate towards the console strictly because I like to curl up on the couch.

1831
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Play the game.

1832
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Like I don't know. There's just PC games has a different.

1833
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Maybe it's ridiculous. I don't know.

1834
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:56,000
But just like sitting in the office chair playing my PC games is not the same to me as being on the couch.

1835
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I love Steam.

1836
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
All lazy.

1837
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Yeah and Steam will occasionally have those really fucking good sales that will make me want to buy a game on it.

1838
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
So.

1839
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
That was broken.

1840
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,000
But like Portal is a good example of a game I bought on PC because it was a really good fucking deal.

1841
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I prefer playing it on PC.

1842
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I mean for me it's just easier to control even with my trackball mouse.

1843
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Now that's a keyboard mouse thing right?

1844
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Yeah.

1845
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Yeah.

1846
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I play, but see I played Portal on my PC because it looked better but I used a 360 controller.

1847
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Interesting. Okay.

1848
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I tried playing it with a 360 controller and I just didn't like it.

1849
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
It wasn't very intuitive to me.

1850
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Yeah I played DC Universe on the PC but I played with a controller.

1851
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Now I was, you know, I was stuck on using a controller forever like when I played Final Fantasy XI.

1852
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I used a controller.

1853
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I had all my macros queued to my trigger buttons and everything.

1854
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:55,000
And I played PSO, you know, with a controller and it wasn't until I started playing World of Warcraft that I started playing keyboard and mouse.

1855
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Something that came up on this week's Hoard House, Plug Plug, the show I do all about, all things World of Warcraft at www.hoardhouse.com.

1856
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Never too seriously though with Extifer.

1857
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
One of the things he brought up this week was that his brother in law likes to play World of Warcraft.

1858
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I guess something he's been getting into on a PS3 controller.

1859
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And like it actually kind of works.

1860
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:17,000
And the way it, it's very similar to how Final Fantasy XI played on the PlayStation 2 controller where you have to kind of macro things to buttons.

1861
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
But it actually kind of works.

1862
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
He was doing quests with them and everything.

1863
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
I guess the only thing that gets a little wonky I think he said was the camera gets a little weird.

1864
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
I can see that.

1865
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
But I found that to be very interesting.

1866
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:31,000
But you know if he's fast enough with macro attacks I bet using a controller would make it really good for PvP.

1867
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Yeah. Could be very interesting.

1868
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Because I can't do PvP because I can't mouse turn with my mouse.

1869
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,000
I just do hide in the corner while everyone else does PvP.

1870
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
That's why the big battlegrounds are fun.

1871
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Yeah that's why. I like the big battlegrounds.

1872
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Yeah so I guess it's really just a number of factors that go into the decision.

1873
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I can't like sit here and say, oh I would always go PS3.

1874
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Because I don't.

1875
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
It just kind of, where's everyone else going to be?

1876
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
What kind of game is it?

1877
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Where am I going to be playing it the most?

1878
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
All those things kind of weigh into it.

1879
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
For me I really just prefer almost anything on Xbox 360.

1880
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:13,000
The controller feels pretty comfortable to my hand because I have to have a slightly wider reach on the PS3.

1881
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:18,000
And the way that the little parts that stick out sit on my hand is because of my surgery really.

1882
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
So it's hard for me.

1883
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I will say this.

1884
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I'm glad I have the choice.

1885
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And I realize not everyone invests in the 360 and the PS3.

1886
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And a high end PC capable of running today's games.

1887
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I realize not everybody can juggle all those things.

1888
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:40,000
But you know I like that I'm fortunate enough where I have been able to have all those so I can make the decision.

1889
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,000
For the record I just got completely light headed once the sugar hit my brain.

1890
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
From those cupcakes.

1891
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I know.

1892
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Good times.

1893
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And my stomach aches.

1894
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
The butter and the buttercream is kind of making me feel sick.

1895
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I only ate one.

1896
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I'm eating it anyways.

1897
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I had a frappuccino on the way in here and that was enough sugar so I didn't need it.

1898
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
We'll get you the other lid for that other container.

1899
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
You guys all know how I feel about pumpkin and pumpkin spice frappuccinos are back.

1900
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I want a pumpkin spice muffin right the hell now.

1901
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
No I've been wanting one since breakfast.

1902
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
So.

1903
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,000
You better go now before all the Starbucks close.

1904
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
So tomorrow.

1905
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
You know what?

1906
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
They should have had pumpkin at um.

1907
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
No because I didn't like the pumpkin at Pinkberry.

1908
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Oh I love the pumpkin at Pinkberry.

1909
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
It was good.

1910
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
It wasn't as good.

1911
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Anyway.

1912
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Yeah.

1913
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Let's get into rapid fire news.

1914
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Back to gaming news.

1915
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
A lot of quick stories we want to talk about with you guys.

1916
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Before we get to some of the other stuff.

1917
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Loki start us off.

1918
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Just like they did with the Resident Evil series.

1919
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:44,000
They're going to be bringing HD remakes of Devil May Cry 1, 2, and 3.

1920
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
To the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

1921
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
And this is coming to us from an ESRB leak.

1922
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Or well.

1923
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
A rating I guess.

1924
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
It leaked out that they were putting that stuff out.

1925
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
But.

1926
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
It's been rated for all three games.

1927
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
On um.

1928
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
On the consoles.

1929
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
So.

1930
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Uh.

1931
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Very interesting that those will be coming out.

1932
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
And uh.

1933
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
They're kind of the trend lately.

1934
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Just do some HD remakes and.

1935
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Pop them up on there and people will buy them.

1936
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
So.

1937
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Look for an announcement I'm sure.

1938
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Soon.

1939
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Um.

1940
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
And the kind that go along with that.

1941
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Crisis.

1942
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Rumor to be coming to the new consoles.

1943
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Um.

1944
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Now has um.

1945
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:33,000
I guess it's going to be coming to the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade this October.

1946
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Also coming I believe from a leak as well.

1947
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Um.

1948
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
And of course these games are going to be remastered.

1949
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,000
They're going to be also available in 3D.

1950
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
And they're.

1951
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
They announced that they're going to be 1600 Microsoft points or 1999.

1952
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Um.

1953
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
So that's kind of cool.

1954
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
And those will be coming soon.

1955
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
And the original crisis was a really good game.

1956
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Just.

1957
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I couldn't finish mine on the PC because.

1958
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Well.

1959
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
It wouldn't let me.

1960
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Bad glitches.

1961
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
And then last but not least.

1962
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
There's this trend.

1963
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I wouldn't say it's a.

1964
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Big trend.

1965
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
But uh.

1966
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Something that they call swatting.

1967
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
It's a griefing trend.

1968
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Basically one of the Xbox Live mods.

1969
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I had this happen to him.

1970
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Swatting is where somebody basically calls up the FBI or tips off you know the police

1971
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
or whatever that.

1972
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
A certain person that you say may want to grief.

1973
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Has you know bombs or hostages or whatever in their house.

1974
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
And of course since police have to take things like that seriously.

1975
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
They go and storm the guys house and.

1976
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
What not.

1977
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Um.

1978
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
So yeah apparently this guy had it happened and.

1979
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
They.

1980
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,000
The police chief believes that the griefers hacked into a nine one one text messaging

1981
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
service to pull off.

1982
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Um.

1983
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
The griefing.

1984
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
So they're all we have officers respond in lights and sirens.

1985
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,000
To call they think is an emergency in progress and they get there only to find out it's a

1986
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
hoax.

1987
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
So apparently that's fucked up.

1988
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
There's a hundred hundred documented cases.

1989
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
So far the FBI is tracking so.

1990
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,000
All the way from like Oregon to Florida.

1991
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,000
That is so fucked up to do that like that in juvenile that better fucking come around

1992
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,000
to bite these people in the ass because not only is it just fucked up to do to somebody

1993
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
but that is such a waste of money because the police department the fire department

1994
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
all that they've got to take that shit seriously you know.

1995
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:37,000
And that's thousands of dollars of our money that's spent on these laws and it's not fucking

1996
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
funny.

1997
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
You know what I mean.

1998
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
It's just sad.

1999
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Very unfortunate.

2000
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Although I'd have to ask is how the fuck do they get the guy's address.

2001
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
That's a very good question.

2002
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Unfortunately probably more hacking of some sort or could it be as simple as the guys

2003
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
in the yellow or the white pages.

2004
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Does that even exist anymore.

2005
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I guess there are still phone books.

2006
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Yeah they they drop a phone book off at my doorstep every once in a while.

2007
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
This is a big advertisement for all the companies so you know what.

2008
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
The day and age that we live in right now with the Internet I just throw that shit in

2009
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
the garbage.

2010
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
The phone book's a waste of money.

2011
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
It's unfortunate.

2012
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Anyhow.

2013
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Moving on to some more news.

2014
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
The Sim social we mentioned earlier.

2015
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:22,000
It is currently a more active game than Farmville on Facebook.

2016
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:27,000
So Sim social is now actually surpassed Farmville in the amount of daily active users.

2017
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:33,000
The Sim social is seeing an average of nine point three million active users per day.

2018
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
They play on the average three times a day in 15 to 20 minute increments.

2019
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Of course if you're dark soccer that's backwards.

2020
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,000
She plays 15 to 20 times a day in three minute increments.

2021
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Just kidding.

2022
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
That's pretty true.

2023
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Okay I'm not kidding.

2024
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Anyhow Farmville still has eight point one million people but the most popular game on

2025
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Facebook right now.

2026
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Cityville also by Zynga.

2027
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Thirteen point nine million users a day.

2028
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:02,000
The only app that gets more traffic than that is Windows Messenger Live which is somehow

2029
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
integrated into Facebook.

2030
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I've never even used that.

2031
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
There you go.

2032
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
So what isn't said is how much fucking wall spam has gone out because of this app.

2033
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,000
It's one of those things I hate that I play it but I can't stop playing.

2034
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Argh.

2035
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I would block people that did that.

2036
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Here's a game that I can't be sad about enjoying because it's really fucking good.

2037
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Little Big Planet 2.

2038
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Well okay so I haven't really played the sequel like I've played the original.

2039
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
But I will at some point.

2040
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
It just went on sale.

2041
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I need to get it.

2042
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Little Big Planet 2 just got its move patch.

2043
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I guess it's.

2044
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
I could loan it to you.

2045
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
It's not.

2046
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Oh that'd be great.

2047
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
It's not going live just yet until the move pack goes out.

2048
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:44,000
But update 1.06 is out which does release some new censors.

2049
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Some limiting players on homebrew levels.

2050
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
You can control the basic game with the move controller now.

2051
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:55,000
So all that stuff is setting up to take away for the move support officially in Little

2052
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Big Planet 2 which comes with the move pack very very very soon.

2053
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Lastly if you build games a little more seriously than Little Big Planet 2.

2054
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Not to say Little Big Planet is a serious business.

2055
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
But this is real serious business.

2056
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Raw source code of popular games.

2057
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
How popular?

2058
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Wolfenstein 3D Platinum and Doom Classic.

2059
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Don't worry guys.

2060
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,000
This is legit.

2061
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
ID Software actually released the source codes themselves.

2062
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
You can go get the source codes for these games.

2063
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
And there you go.

2064
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
It's update 2.1.

2065
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
And you can go grab the source code and tinker away at that.

2066
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I'd be excited to see what kind of games come out of that.

2067
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I think the Wolfenstein code had been released before and this is some type of upgrade.

2068
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
But there you go.

2069
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Moving on Dark Soccer.

2070
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
What do you have for us?

2071
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
How about some DJ Max Technica?

2072
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I know that you like that game right?

2073
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
I do.

2074
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
The arcade game is pretty awesome.

2075
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
What's coming to the Vita?

2076
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
It's going to be.

2077
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Yeah it's actually DJ Max Technica going to be out on the Vita.

2078
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,000
There is not a date yet but they say it looks like it's going to be really hard.

2079
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And that it's going to use both the touch screen and the rear touch panel.

2080
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
So who knows?

2081
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:09,000
That makes a lot of sense considering that you know when I heard about this I was like

2082
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
oh yeah cause the game is basically on a giant touch screen.

2083
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
It's basically Elite Beat Agents.

2084
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Yeah.

2085
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
And then other news.

2086
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Microsoft says 42% of US Xbox Live Gold members watch an average of an hour of video content a day.

2087
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,000
And that's including Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Zune on Xbox 360.

2088
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:36,000
So it looks like there are going to be quite a bit more going on.

2089
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:41,000
In fact it was reported by Terry Farrell, not to be confused with the lady that played Judzia Dax.

2090
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Who is the Senior Product Manager of Xbox Live Entertainment.

2091
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
This report comes from him.

2092
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:54,000
So they're going to definitely be working to up that in the fall dashboard update.

2093
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:58,000
And then sad, sad, sad news.

2094
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Game writing pioneer Bill Kunkel passed away.

2095
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Very sad.

2096
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
He died on September 4th.

2097
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
He was the Game Doctor.

2098
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Does that sound familiar to anybody?

2099
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I totally remember the Game Doctor columns from the old magazines from back in the...

2100
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Oh god that was like the 80s.

2101
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Computer Gaming World.

2102
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Video Game Computer Entertainment, right?

2103
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Yep.

2104
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And the original Electronic Games, not to be confused with Electronic Gaming Monthly.

2105
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Yeah.

2106
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Oh yeah.

2107
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
The Commodore 64 magazines.

2108
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
We had them all.

2109
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
That and the Commodore 64 magazines.

2110
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
But Bill wasn't a part of those.

2111
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
I don't think.

2112
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Well he was 61 years old.

2113
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And he'd been working on video game columns since 1978.

2114
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
And he co-founded EGM.

2115
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Wow.

2116
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
He will be missed.

2117
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,000
As I understand it, he was working right up until the unfortunate...

2118
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Because the death was unexpected as I hear.

2119
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
So he was still doing some work on websites and so forth.

2120
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
So it's surprising.

2121
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
It's very unfortunate.

2122
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I'm pulling up a list of other things that he worked on.

2123
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Because he said he also did stuff for DC and Marvel.

2124
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Actually also worked with KKWD, Fogg Studios, Metropolis Media.

2125
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Busy guy.

2126
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Lots of stuff.

2127
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:24,000
And did a lot of the strategy guides for Prima.

2128
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Oh wow.

2129
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Maximo Carnage, Descent, FPS Baseball, Gex, Die Hard Trilogy, NFL Quarterback Club 98, Madden 64, and Brady.

2130
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
So he was actually getting into game development at some point.

2131
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
He did Madden 64 for a Brady game. Sorry.

2132
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Oh I see. Okay. Interesting.

2133
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
So yeah, pretty crazy stuff.

2134
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
It's too bad.

2135
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Yeah.

2136
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Too bad.

2137
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Well that's it for our quick news tonight.

2138
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
So let's get back into more news.

2139
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I don't know why we have the quick news and then the long news.

2140
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
But I don't know. It's just the way we've been doing it.

2141
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Whatever. Let's move on. Loki.

2142
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:10,000
So you may remember that during Gamescom they announced that the PSP is going to be getting a new version out in Europe that was going to be Sans Wi-Fi.

2143
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:17,000
And we're kind of wondering why they went ahead and did this seeing as the Vita is going to be coming out soon.

2144
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Well one of the things that they're trying to do is target teens.

2145
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
They're saying it's all for the audience.

2146
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:29,000
If we're going to take PSP very young, teens and much younger, they're happy to just play the game.

2147
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:34,000
If taking Wi-Fi out is the price to pay, we're happy to do it.

2148
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:42,000
And they also believe that the price point will give the console a much needed sales bump, especially during the upcoming holiday season.

2149
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:50,000
And they're saying that at 99 euro it'll make a great Christmas gift.

2150
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Of course the new system is dubbed the E1000.

2151
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Honestly, if you're really looking for a PSP system, you can buy a new system for less than that with Wi-Fi.

2152
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:11,000
But it's what the gamers want, Loki. It's what the 13 year old gamers want.

2153
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Wi-Fi doesn't cost that much. I mean, come on.

2154
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:21,000
And you know what? Teenagers nowadays have smartphones. They have iPods, iPhones, whatnot.

2155
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Teenagers do not need a PSP. They need a school book.

2156
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I understand that, but they are connected to the internet.

2157
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
It's like they're saying, well, teenagers are just happy to play the game.

2158
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Yes, some of them are just happy to play the games.

2159
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:45,000
But you know what? You can still buy one of your older PSP systems and have that functionality in there for the same price, if not cheaper.

2160
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Have you heard that whole, not to deviate too much from the story, but have you heard that whole story about how the kids at some schools in certain districts are now, instead of getting textbooks, they get iPads with the books on them?

2161
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Because, believe it or not, a $600 iPad or whatever, well, what's the lowest one cost? Maybe $400?

2162
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Those iPads are cheaper than some of the textbooks for all those classes combined.

2163
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
It's like the iPad is becoming a cheaper alternative. It's crazy.

2164
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
To the textbooks.

2165
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Yep. How about this? How about instead of spending $500 on an iPad, which granted is a good piece of technology, but how about you spend it on a cheaper e-reader and you can put those books on there?

2166
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Dude, you can get HP touch pads for $100. They should have got in on that deal.

2167
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I mean, if it's reading just books, that's all it's doing, I think there's cheaper alternatives out there than just that.

2168
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Or, here's an idea, pretty much everybody, you know, nowadays in school and stuff, and I know that there's people out there that are, you know, without a substantial income, but you gotta admit, most people probably have a PC at home.

2169
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Right.

2170
01:59:51,000 --> 02:00:00,000
You know, the majority of people out there have a PC. Just give it to them in like a PDF format or something like that. I guess if you're bringing it to the school, but...

2171
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:07,000
What are the authors of those books? I mean, a desktop. You could have a desktop computer at each one of these desk...

2172
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I think a lot do now.

2173
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Yes, and then just have the book on there.

2174
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Geez. Alright, going to our chatroom at chat.orangetonshade.com, taking you back to what the story was originally about before we got on that tangent, ToaGak in our chatroom says,

2175
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:36,000
You want to know what my PSP is used for? 99% WiFi, 1% games. You know, I've heard that a lot. Not so much the teenage crowd, but the college crowd really loves that the PSP is a web browser, an MP3 player, and it happens to play games.

2176
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:44,000
And I've said this a million times on the show before. I'm starting to sound like a broken record. The PSP's biggest strength was always the fact that it didn't just do games.

2177
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:49,000
It did, well, like their little tagline, it only does everything, and that really is Sony's strength.

2178
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:52,000
It's not going to do much, though, when it doesn't have WiFi.

2179
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Exactly. So it's like, it only does nothing, is what this system does.

2180
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I just don't understand what the point is, because it will help bump sales. I don't know about the Europe region, but in the US and North America, there's not a lot of PSP games coming out.

2181
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:13,000
There's like five. Five for the whole fourth quarter.

2182
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I was fascinated to go to Fry's today, as I was talking about before, and see that they are still selling the PSP movies.

2183
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
You can still buy PSP movies.

2184
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Yeah, probably got them for a good deal, because no one's selling them anymore.

2185
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Five to ten bucks.

2186
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Sony was the only one for the longest time that was putting out movies on that system. The last movie I remember on the UMD format was 2012.

2187
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:45,000
That's a Sony title, so obviously that makes sense why that would be on there. Well, it sort of makes sense.

2188
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Those things are dirt cheap now. They're definitely not manufacturing them anymore.

2189
02:01:50,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Yeah, I don't understand the point. Of course they want their system to sell well, but I think removing a pretty integral feature from the system that, once again, with the whole PSP Go and stuff,

2190
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:11,000
you don't need to reinvent the system to help it sell. Why are you going to spend more money on a system that does less?

2191
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:19,000
That's the whole point here. Why would I spend more money on a system that doesn't have Wi-Fi when I can use this in preferred, but you know what?

2192
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Those so-called teenagers probably don't give a shit that it's a little bit used, and it will come with games for less than that.

2193
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:37,000
In fact, I think I was taking a look here. I saw some new, well, some used PSP systems on eBay.

2194
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:47,000
We'll see here. They've got the Giga pack or whatever. $65 starting on those used.

2195
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Also, if you just want the PSP Slim, they have the Slim with Crysis Core, the Final Fantasy VII bundle or whatever, and silver. $89.

2196
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:03,000
And I know that the Euros, that's almost one and a half times the US dollar.

2197
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:13,000
I mean, shit, you can buy a new system here for $129.99, brand new. And they're region-free, so why not?

2198
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Or at this point, you might as well just wait for the Vita.

2199
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Alright, we'll get something else.

2200
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Well, moving on to a totally different topic. This is about not getting between somebody and their bandwidth.

2201
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:31,000
You know, nothing gets the internet rabble-rabble more than hearing about internet service providers and their recent restrictions.

2202
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Well, this has to do with a Canadian provider, actually. It has to do with Rogers Cable and Telcom, who's Canada's largest broadband provider.

2203
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Apparently, they had some complaints from World of Warcraft players saying that the World of Warcraft traffic was being throttled.

2204
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Now, oh my gosh, that just goes double so. Do not get between, and I say this as a Warcraft player, do not get between me and my WoW.

2205
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Do not try to limit my bandwidth and lower my ping times.

2206
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:04,000
And there was accusations that Rogers was apparently throttling the bandwidth and so forth.

2207
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Rogers has admitted that the game's online traffic might actually trip the monitors that kind of monitor this stuff and result in throttling.

2208
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:19,000
They are calling this inadvertent, but that doesn't fix the problem.

2209
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I guess Canadian regulators have even gotten involved.

2210
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,000
The Canadian Gamers Organization, I didn't even know that existed. That's kind of cool.

2211
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,000
They actually filed an inquiry into the practices of this company.

2212
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:40,000
So I guess what happens is because you've got the peer-to-peer traffic going on in World of Warcraft, it's being misclassified as something more nefarious.

2213
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
By the way, the same thing apparently is happening in Call of Duty Black Ops.

2214
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I guess the rule is that if something is transmitting 80 kbps or more, it is what is enabling the throttling.

2215
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:58,000
So, now Rogers says that the games can all run underneath that rate.

2216
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:03,000
So those who are experiencing the throttling must be running some type of other application with the gaming.

2217
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:07,000
But I kind of sit there and go, what about Ventrilo and some of the other stuff?

2218
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:15,000
I'm notorious for playing WoW and surfing the web at the same time. Just put a renew on somebody and then go alt-tab and check my email.

2219
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Anyhow, let's see. I guess the co-founder of the Canadian Gamer Organization said,

2220
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:42,000
quote, rather than fixing the issue and actively whitelisting gaming systems to ensure they are not affected, Rogers is continuing to rely on consumer input and complaints rather than put forth the active testing needed to ensure compliance with CRTC policy.

2221
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,000
We believe this approach is inappropriate under these circumstances.

2222
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:56,000
So the Canadian Gamer Organization is going to ask for a new law requiring providers like Rogers to have a formal way for customers to report complaints.

2223
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Canadians are pissed and you don't hear that very often.

2224
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Honestly, I think I would be too.

2225
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Oh yeah, you don't get between somebody and their WoW. You just don't. Call of Duty, all those people.

2226
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Especially, the shitty thing is that it is legitimate use of the internet and it's being throttled.

2227
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Like, I understand why they want to throttle bandwidth and so forth, but you know, unfortunately, legit people pay the cost of somebody else.

2228
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:32,000
All the time, the common thing. Same thing we've said about DRM time and time again.

2229
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Let's get to the emails.

2230
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

2231
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,000
DarkSocker is going to dive into the email bag and pull out a few of her favorite emails.

2232
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Ew, it's so sticky!

2233
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Alright, the first one.

2234
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Hi all, just wanted to point out that you could actually surf the net on the DS.

2235
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:58,000
They just didn't release the attachments in the USA. When I was in Japan, I bought it and it was one of the ones that used the GBA slot in a different way.

2236
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:06,000
As for the 3DS vs Vita, well, I just got a 3DS. The PSP never appealed to me. I love the 3DS.

2237
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Although I did buy mine on eBay for $195 for 3DS games included and the Nintendo Ambassador program.

2238
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:17,000
With the Vita, and by the way, it's V-I-T-A, not D-A.

2239
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:27,000
It would have to pull off something really impressive because Netflix on my 3DS is awesome.

2240
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Not going to buy another system if the one I have now can do it already and that's from Holly D.

2241
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:42,000
You know what, that is correct. I could have sworn we would have made that clear because I was aware that the DS had a web browser but only on the DS's that had the eShop.

2242
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:50,000
And that would start with the DSi and above. However, I do remember that I did forget that Japan did have a cart.

2243
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Actually, I found one for sale at the local dimple.

2244
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
The US also had a cart.

2245
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Did they really?

2246
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Yes, it came with a memory expansion slot that goes in the Game Boy Advance slot.

2247
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Well, I did forget about the browser and the cartridge.

2248
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
But still terrible.

2249
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Yeah, I don't like browsing the web on the 3DS either.

2250
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
It is terrible.

2251
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
It's clunky, I don't know.

2252
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Well, moving forward.

2253
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Needs to be optimized. Ok.

2254
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Evening. I would have sent this last week but didn't realize you had a Labor Day weekend show.

2255
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Anyhow, I see the mobile game Flight Control is now available for WiiWare.

2256
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Fairly nice to have this one on a full display with local multiplayer, although the lack of versus is somewhat disappointing.

2257
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Also, it really puts the infamous Wii Remote jitter front and center.

2258
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Sorry, I believe last year Firemint was supposed to have a PS Move version of the game.

2259
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Did they say why this never came out in North America?

2260
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
And that's from Robert M.

2261
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
No, and I got to admit, I'm not very familiar with that game.

2262
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
What is it called again?

2263
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Flight Control?

2264
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Hmm.

2265
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Loki, is this a game you know about?

2266
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I think Flight Control is one of those air traffic controller games where you control the different planes that are taking off and stuff.

2267
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
I think they have that kind of stuff on the iPod.

2268
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
It might have been a WiiWare game.

2269
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
It said it was originally a mobile game.

2270
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Yeah.

2271
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,000
I'm looking at a trailer here for the game.

2272
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:14,000
I'm so visual, I need to see this here.

2273
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Oh!

2274
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
See?

2275
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Once I see it, this is based on an iPad game.

2276
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:24,000
This is where you draw the path of the planes and you don't want them to collide.

2277
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
This is based off an iPad game.

2278
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
See?

2279
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
I just had to see it.

2280
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I do know this game.

2281
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,000
I didn't know that they had ported it to anything besides the iPad.

2282
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:37,000
That part's news to me.

2283
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
So there you go.

2284
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Sorry, I don't know the other answer to your question.

2285
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I'm sorry.

2286
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Rob, you're going to need to pull up this email because apparently there's a YouTube link.

2287
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I'm going to copy it to you.

2288
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Yeah, just copy the YouTube link to me.

2289
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
But I will read you the...

2290
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Let me just paste it to you real quick.

2291
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Live radio, kids.

2292
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,000
It's what we're all about here.

2293
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Hey, I'm fast.

2294
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
With my damn trackball.

2295
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Do I play it now or when you say?

2296
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
After this.

2297
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I'll go ahead and read this.

2298
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Yo homies, Xenocore here.

2299
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:12,000
I'm sad that I just discovered this song, but you must use this for Listless this Sunday.

2300
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Okay?

2301
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
For Listless?

2302
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
This is from the Rubber Bandits, Horse Outside.

2303
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
And don't use the clean version.

2304
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
This song is freaking awesome.

2305
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
I think they're talking about Cage Match.

2306
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Oh, yeah.

2307
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
It's probably Cage Match.

2308
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
But, hey.

2309
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Don't be going fucking dumb stuff and around like one of them covers, you know?

2310
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Dudes with accents.

2311
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Let me forward a little bit here.

2312
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Yeah, I think this is something for the Cage Match segment, not the...

2313
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Veto.

2314
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,000
That's it.

2315
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
I'll check it out later.

2316
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Veto.

2317
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Not when we're live on air.

2318
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Okay.

2319
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Well, that's it.

2320
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,000
That's it?

2321
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
That's it.

2322
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
We need more emails.

2323
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Well, the other one was someone trying to get us to, like, post his stuff, and I'm like,

2324
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
no.

2325
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

2326
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Orangelauntrader.com.

2327
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Free plugs.

2328
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,000
You have to disguise for free plugs.

2329
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I'm not free.

2330
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
All right.

2331
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,000
All right.

2332
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Let's get to the part of the show where we...

2333
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
It costs a lot of money to be this cheap.

2334
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Let's get to the part of the show where we get ranty.

2335
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:17,000
It's the FUs of the week, and we do them here on the show because we can.

2336
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:36,000
FU to finding out about emo crap during the show.

2337
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Ugh.

2338
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Loki.

2339
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Fucking my cat for being an asshole.

2340
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Um.

2341
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
I don't know.

2342
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,000
FU to the fact that this weekend was shorter than last weekend.

2343
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
No, FU to the three-hour nap I took yesterday.

2344
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:54,000
This is the first weekend in forever where I had literally nothing planned on Saturday.

2345
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,000
It was amazing to just sit at home all day and veg.

2346
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
But what did I do?

2347
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,000
I napped literally the whole damn day away.

2348
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
But I feel really rested, and I feel great.

2349
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
So, I guess I needed it.

2350
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
But FU to what felt like a wasted day.

2351
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
All right.

2352
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:13,000
A few more news stories for you guys, then we're gonna open it up to you guys via Twitter,

2353
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R, and our Skype line at 1877 game O-L-R.

2354
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
But don't call yet, because we still have a few more stories to get through.

2355
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Yeah, Origin has been doing pretty well.

2356
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:29,000
EA's new, um, kind of e-commerce site for streaming game.

2357
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Well, not really streaming games, but downloading digital games and stuff like that.

2358
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,000
They have four million client installs.

2359
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:42,000
That doesn't really translate into purchases, but it's been installed on four million computers.

2360
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:46,000
They're gonna be adding third-party content very soon.

2361
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:58,000
And, of course, they're saying that it will use its collection of 130 million users and various payment methods to attract third-party games to Origin.

2362
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:01,000
So, wait a second.

2363
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:09,000
So, what they're saying is they have four million client installs, yet 130 million users?

2364
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
That doesn't really make sense to me.

2365
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Whatever.

2366
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I guess they're talking about maybe the Electronic Arts site and how they have that, like, uh...

2367
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Oh, like when you do Dragon Age and stuff? You have to sign up for their stupid online thing?

2368
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Yeah, I like how they count all those players in there.

2369
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:32,000
They don't have a choice. They have to sign up on that site in order to play those games.

2370
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:39,000
It's not like, oh, I love EA. I'm gonna totally register an account with them because they're awesome,

2371
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
and I love their products, and I really...

2372
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
You have no choice.

2373
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:46,000
But I like how they skew that. That's awesome.

2374
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:58,000
And then, of course, there's some information from Origin regarding a new remake of Syndicate, that series.

2375
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Apparently, it's gonna be done by the developer Starbreeze, who did Escape from Butcher Bay and The Darkness.

2376
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:13,000
And I guess they're showing off some stuff. Some stuff, I guess, leaked out from their website.

2377
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Looks interesting. They're saying that the story's penned by the guy that did the Crysis 2 script,

2378
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
and he also wrote some books and stuff.

2379
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Also, that it's supposed to debut next week in the Game Reactor magazine, which is a Swedish publication.

2380
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:42,000
And, I don't know, it looks kinda cool. So, I guess, check out the EA Origins store if you wanna catch some details on that,

2381
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:47,000
or just check out the web, because it's leaked out.

2382
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Alright. I have yet to use the Origins store, but I remember we got a call last week saying it's not that bad, you guys.

2383
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:59,000
But it is interesting that it has so many installs, but isn't that because it's kind of forced on people?

2384
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I don't know.

2385
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Well, Origin, I mean, some of it's probably voluntary. Some of it was, didn't it become Origin, like it was something else,

2386
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:10,000
and then it just translated over to Origin?

2387
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:16,000
God, well, whenever I hear Origin, I think about the old school publishing house, or studio, that would make,

2388
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
like the old Ultimate games are all Origin.

2389
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Yeah, I think that's what this is.

2390
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:23,000
No. No, no, no, no. This is Steam. This is their Steam competitor.

2391
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Well, I understand that, but Origin was that company, and now it's the site.

2392
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Right, EA sucked them up, and then never used the name, and now they just brought back the name for this,

2393
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:36,000
but the two uses of the name have nothing to do with each other. Does that make sense?

2394
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Oh, yeah, it makes sense.

2395
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Anyhow, Wii U, this has been some big news talking about this week, and, you know, while this reeks of being a rumor,

2396
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:54,000
this is coming from that French site that's been getting a lot of smoking guns lately.

2397
02:15:54,000 --> 02:16:01,000
They've become quite the site to get the early gossip, because they leaked the news about the Vita, right, I think?

2398
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:05,000
They leaked the news about the extra thing on the 3DS, which now we have a picture of,

2399
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:11,000
and now they're talking about this, so take it with a grain of salt, but it's very interesting we're writing the Wii U.

2400
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Apparently, they're saying that Nintendo is having big problems getting the Wii U up and running.

2401
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Apparently, the Wii U is not up to wanting to do what Nintendo needs it to do.

2402
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:28,000
It's not just running the console, but beaming the data to the touchscreen controller as well.

2403
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Apparently, developers that are working on the console, they use tethers to ensure that the communication,

2404
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:40,000
so basically it has to do with the wireless aspect of it, and right now the developers have to use a wire to the controller

2405
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:43,000
to make sure the information gets across fast enough.

2406
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Even then, apparently things aren't still working out that well.

2407
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Progress is halted daily with repeated software updates for the pad. Hmm, interesting.

2408
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Apparently, these problems are causing a delay in the console's launch.

2409
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Originally, they had been looking at June 2012, but now they're saying September 2012,

2410
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:09,000
which to me, personally, I would have said, well, that was the timeframe I was thinking for the system anyways.

2411
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
That doesn't seem like such a huge setback.

2412
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Now, obviously, you can't prove these allegations. Nintendo, even though the blogs are trying to get them to comment,

2413
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
they're not going to. They're going to say, we don't comment on re-imagination and speculation,

2414
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:28,000
but it definitely kind of says, hmm, maybe this is not going to be ready by the time it needs to roll out,

2415
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:31,000
or at least it's going to be really gimped.

2416
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:36,000
So I'm sure Loki's just ready to unfold on this one, right, Loki? What do you think of hearing all this?

2417
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:46,000
It's still really early. I mean, I don't know. It's hard to say. I mean, it's not good.

2418
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:55,000
I mean, I just don't know. I just don't know if it's really going to end up being true.

2419
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Obviously, they're not going to launch the system if it's, you know, not going to work.

2420
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:06,000
If it's flat doesn't work, they're not going to launch it, but might they have to downgrade it a little bit to get it to work?

2421
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Or I guess it could go the other way around. They'd have to upgrade it to get it to work too, huh?

2422
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:16,000
I'm not sure which way it goes. Do you downgrade the processing power so that way there's not as much data to transmit?

2423
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Or do you upgrade, I guess, finding the balance?

2424
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:25,000
But it is interesting that the PlayStation 3 kind of does this with the PSP right now.

2425
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:29,000
It's a little lag though. I mean, it wouldn't, the technology has to get a little bit better than that.

2426
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:34,000
I don't know how it's going to work with the PS3 and the Vita, but you know, it's a little bit laggy.

2427
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,000
And obviously, they don't want that on the Wii U.

2428
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:45,000
So, I'm wondering though what it uses because I was just looking this up.

2429
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Just a theory here. One reason why we may be seeing the whole 3DS getting a second analog stick is maybe they're just not going to put out the controller at all.

2430
02:18:54,000 --> 02:19:09,000
It's just going to use the 3DS and because the 3DS has 802.11g, it's a lot more bandwidth than say, ad hoc wireless, which I'm not really sure what speed that's at, but I don't think it's as fast as wireless g.

2431
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:17,000
So, if that's the case, then they'd be able to fit more data through there. Plus, it's a smaller screen. Maybe? I don't know.

2432
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Interesting comment from Imaginomicon in chat. In all fairness, Kinect had basically the same situation.

2433
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:27,000
That is, it couldn't do what they initially advertised and was eventually gimped.

2434
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Weren't there early rumors about the Kinect that the Kinect couldn't see certain races and things like that?

2435
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Yeah, that's not true though.

2436
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Okay, that was just bad PR for Microsoft.

2437
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:42,000
They're all, oh, I can't see black people. No, that's not true.

2438
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Well, obviously I can now, but you know.

2439
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Well, it could before. It was just like, if you're playing on, you know, it depends on where you're playing. If you're playing with something with a lot of light interference or if it's too dark or something like that.

2440
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Well, I can't play Kinect in the dark either. I mean, you gotta have some, you know, some light.

2441
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:09,000
So, it was stupid because it was like, well, actually it won't detect anybody in those lighting conditions and not necessarily just people of a certain race.

2442
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:12,000
So, yeah, that was just...

2443
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:21,000
But I do seem to recall that it seemed like the Kinect, I want to say there was a story about how they did have to kind of change the Kinect too.

2444
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Well, I think they dropped the resolution down so they could have more bandwidth to go between the sensor and, you know, the system.

2445
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:43,000
But, you know, that's just a little bit of data going back and forth via like USB, but this isn't even close to that. This is going to be like streaming video and inputs and stuff like that.

2446
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:48,000
You're talking about being able to play games streaming from your console onto the...

2447
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Which, I don't understand why it's not possible. I mean, you can do it on the PSP, but you can do it on the PSP over the internet and over that 802.11g.

2448
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:08,000
So, maybe like I said before, more bandwidth there and allow you to be able to do what you can't do on the console.

2449
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Although, why couldn't you make the controller connect to your WiFi network?

2450
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Hey, then you can even add it. So, hey, look, you can surf the web on this controller, but it's not going to let you do that.

2451
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:24,000
All right, well, let's move on with a few more stories before we get to the Twitter topics and phone calls.

2452
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:28,000
I'm expecting to hear about this and some phone calls tonight.

2453
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Dark Soccer, our next story.

2454
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Well, how about the scariest Xbox 360 game? Ooh, what do you think it would be?

2455
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Scariest Xbox 360 game? I don't know.

2456
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Well, it looks that the major vote goes for Dead Space 2. That that is considered to be the scariest game.

2457
02:21:50,000 --> 02:22:06,000
And this is coming just ahead of... What they did is they actually tested core and casual gamer's heart rate, sweat levels and body temperature, while playing Alan Wake, Resident Evil 5, Dead Space 2, and Condemned.

2458
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
It was sad that Yaris wasn't included in there.

2459
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Well, that would have been just... That would have been nausea inducing, not scary.

2460
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:16,000
How about connectable? Some of those fuckers are pretty frightening.

2461
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:23,000
They said that core gamers dealt better with the scares than the apparently wussy casual players.

2462
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:29,000
But they all experienced rapidly increased heart rate, stunted breathing, and a rise in skin temperature.

2463
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:40,000
And there were pretty vocal about some of it too, like one of them started screaming, oh my god, oh my god, this shit is so scary.

2464
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:45,000
It sounds like Shane when they're playing Silent Hill or something.

2465
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Other games that were considered but not found scary enough were Left 4 Dead 2, Gears of War 2, Condemned 2, Fear 1 and 2, Dead Space 1, and Silent Hill Homecoming, Alone in the Dark, and Mass Effect 2.

2466
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,000
But they aren't scary enough to be.

2467
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:07,000
I told you about how Silent Hill Homecoming made me basically scream like a little girl and go shut the front door that had blown open from the wind, and oh my god, that was a horrible night.

2468
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Hearts.

2469
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Like who sits at home alone in the dark and plays Silent Hill? You're just asking for it.

2470
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Well, remember when Miklotov was visiting a while back and played through Silent Hill 2?

2471
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:25,000
And we were all curled up in your living room, like on the couch, in the dark, watching him play.

2472
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
I don't think I was in there.

2473
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Actually, no, you weren't. You weren't there. I was there, and it was like, I think Irene was there.

2474
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:37,000
And, um, Eddie. I think Eddie was there.

2475
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
But yeah, that was pretty funny.

2476
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Well, Christopher was there.

2477
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Because it was when you were living with Christopher.

2478
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Ah, no, I probably just was out.

2479
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Yeah, you were gone.

2480
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I was probably on a hot date.

2481
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,000
While you nerds were playing Silent Hill.

2482
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Dude, that shit was awesome.

2483
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Loki.

2484
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Um, so of course, you know, one of the pioneers of Project $10 was EA.

2485
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,000
And EA's been doing this for a while now.

2486
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Since June of last year, starting with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.

2487
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:17,000
They were including, basically, a voucher in their new games that allowed you to get online access.

2488
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Their online pass, if you will.

2489
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:25,000
And if you bought the game used, well, that might not be in there.

2490
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:29,000
And so you would have to pay $10 to be able to play online.

2491
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Well, EA has come out and said that they have made between $10 and $15 million from online pass.

2492
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:46,000
And apparently the revenues they said that they derived from that haven't been dramatic.

2493
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Um, but since they initiated the program, but it's not a failure at all.

2494
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:57,000
And when you consider that, that's spread across quite a few games.

2495
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:03,000
You know, Tiger Woods, NCAA football, both years for NCAA football and Madden.

2496
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
EA does a lot of sports games.

2497
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:09,000
EA, MMA, um, lots of stuff.

2498
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:15,000
I don't think any non-sports games have been part of this so far, but it's just been sports games.

2499
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:22,000
But also figure, though, that nowadays, especially the EA Sports MMA and some of the older games,

2500
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:29,000
it is still cheaper to buy the game with the $10 pass and use rather than buying it new.

2501
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:34,000
So, you know, some people might not really think of it as a big deal.

2502
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:42,000
And really, they only have to, that's about 1 million people that have bought into this.

2503
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,000
They've split that across, you know, over five games or whatever.

2504
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:50,000
That's, you know, quite a significant amount, I guess.

2505
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:55,000
But 200,000 per title, you know, split across platforms and stuff.

2506
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Wow, they, you know, despite, what do you want to call the number, big or small or whatever,

2507
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:02,000
EA made money appear out of nowhere.

2508
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Yeah, good for them. It's not deserving.

2509
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I don't think that they need that money because, once again, you know, their complaint was,

2510
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:12,000
oh, well, those people that buy the game used, you know.

2511
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:15,000
The tax breaks they're getting from the government just aren't enough.

2512
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Did you read about that this week?

2513
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Oh, yeah, I read about that.

2514
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Yeah, and their excuse, well, those people that are buying used, you know,

2515
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:28,000
we can't support the online, you know, if they're buying the game used because we don't see any of their revenue.

2516
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Yeah, that's a nice way to spin it except for the fact that the person that first bought that game brand new

2517
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:38,000
already paid you that money to, you know, keep up your network.

2518
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:45,000
So, too damn bad. Suck it up. You're EA. You can survive.

2519
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Well, if you really want to stick it to these developers, you could just say, and publishers and so forth,

2520
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,000
you could just say, fuck it, I'm not even going to play these games anymore.

2521
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
I'm going to stick to free shit.

2522
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Or, if you want to play those games, don't play them online.

2523
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:04,000
And I'm not talking about piracy. I'm talking about actually designed to be free to play games.

2524
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:10,000
And I'm not talking about a crappy little Facebook game like SimSocial, which is a crap that I love.

2525
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Anyway, but this is a game. It's a free to download game. It's in beta right now.

2526
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
And it's a game called Oniken.

2527
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Oniken is, I guess, a tribute to challenging 8-bit action games from the NES.

2528
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:30,000
They say that the game is actually NES hard.

2529
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,000
And there's a little clip here I'm going to play in studio, and I think Dark Sakura would be into this

2530
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:39,000
because it looks a bit like the guy's weapon he's using is very Strider-esque.

2531
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:43,000
But, yeah, once again, this is not like a NES ROM. This is actually-

2532
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Oh my god, it does look like a cipher.

2533
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Doesn't it? This is actually designed to be a game on the PC that is just NES tribute, NES style hard.

2534
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:54,000
I don't know if that means, like, we're talking La-Mulana.

2535
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
For what?

2536
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:58,000
It's like buying a command element.

2537
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,000
No, not to me.

2538
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Well, like, the backgrounds.

2539
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Oh, yeah, the artwork is very Bionic command element style.

2540
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
The gameplay, no, nothing like it, though.

2541
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
It looks really fun, though.

2542
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Fast forward to some of these other levels.

2543
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Dude, that almost looks like a rip of the Ninja Gaiden sprite from the original game.

2544
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Like, they just switched it up a little bit.

2545
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Like, even his stance and the way he moves and stuff like that.

2546
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
A little bit, huh?

2547
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Apparently, what's available right now to play three missions in the game.

2548
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Oniken, again, is the name of the game. O-N-I-K-E-N.

2549
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Lots of good visuals and so forth if you want to check it out for yourself.

2550
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Oniken.net. H-T-T-P colon slash slash W-W-W dot O-N-I-K-E-N dot net.

2551
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,000
And I will go ahead and paste that in chat for the live listeners.

2552
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Those of you on the podcast, I hope you were writing quickly.

2553
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Or maybe I can get Dark Soccer to Tumblr or at least the video there, so you guys can check that out.

2554
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Did you link it? Oh, there it is. Yeah. Okay, I'll put it on the thing.

2555
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Cool.

2556
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
That was kind of fun. I had to check that out.

2557
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Big Brother Blade?

2558
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I like the fact that it's free.

2559
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Or Ogre Blade? Maybe? Ogre Blade?

2560
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Free is my favorite word. Absolutely.

2561
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:18,000
How about we open up the phone line and take some of your calls right now.

2562
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:21,000
1-877-GAME-OLR. Speaking of free, you can call us free on that line.

2563
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2564
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
If you want to talk about anything we've talked about tonight,

2565
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:30,000
or if you have something gaming related that we haven't quite got to yet,

2566
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
we will talk about that as well.

2567
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:39,000
Meanwhile, we're going to fire up the Twitter and get to some of your tweets this week at Twitter dot com slash O-L-R.

2568
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Going to the tweets real quick.

2569
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
JVMon sent us a tweet tonight.

2570
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
When did WoW, Warcraft, get so fun?

2571
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:49,000
I can't stop playing. I blame you. Hugs and kisses.

2572
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
When Cataclysm hit?

2573
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:58,000
It's so interesting because to a lot of the hardcore, so to speak, Cataclysm was not so well received.

2574
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
So it's very interesting.

2575
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:06,000
I think the changing of the level 1 to 60 areas, though, is great for those that weren't quite yet into WoW.

2576
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:09,000
So, I think that was kind of cool, I guess.

2577
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:12,000
But yeah, Cataclysm hasn't been all bad news.

2578
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:18,000
It's just I think the early game is much more improved than the end game was, if that makes sense.

2579
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Anyhow, we've got calls coming in, so let's go to it.

2580
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2581
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
It's the one and only Ranma.

2582
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Hey, Ranma. What's on your mind, buddy?

2583
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Oh, last week's podcast. That's what's on my mind tonight.

2584
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Why is that? It was long, wasn't it?

2585
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Yes, yes, it was long, and that was the first time in history I've had to listen to it again just to absorb all that big G bullshit, you know what I'm saying?

2586
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Yeah, last week's show was long because we had an almost additional segment of the show just about the evil G shenanigans.

2587
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:58,000
It was something else, and really good discussion last week.

2588
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:04,000
An impromptu appearance from Dan in the middle of that discussion, who was on the front lines for some time. It was good.

2589
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:08,000
What'd you think of all that, though? Surely you have an opinion.

2590
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Coming from somebody who has worked in retail and for big chain companies, I strongly believe that Square Enix didn't do anything wrong.

2591
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:25,000
The big G is just butthurt, and they're blowing smoke up people's asses.

2592
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:37,000
I don't know. I do think it was in bad form for Squeenix to spring that on people, and I think GameStop had the right to know what was in that box and choose not to sell it.

2593
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:47,000
And, you know, as I said, I don't want to repeat myself from last week, but as I said, the correct answer was what they finally did too late was just push the game back to Squeenix and refuse to sell it.

2594
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:50,000
If they'd just done that to begin with, there wouldn't have been a problem.

2595
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:56,000
To be perfectly honest, I do not believe the whole 48 hours thing.

2596
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Now, during my time working in these big chain companies, when companies like Square, Nintendo, and everybody else, when they're going to do something like that, they send a notice out.

2597
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Usually about two to three weeks prior before do this.

2598
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:23,000
So, I really believe that the big G knew about this, but they were just waiting what to do, what to do.

2599
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:33,000
So, I feel that they decide, oh, let's wait about this time, pull the code out, and just start all of this.

2600
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Part of it could have been a publicity stunt, which I find hard to, but from my retail experience, I don't believe that they just found out two days prior.

2601
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Because if I'm sick of not understanding how any other chain had an issue with it, you know what I'm saying?

2602
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:52,000
It does seem like the memo went out to pull those codes really early on.

2603
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Like, you know, I don't know, I don't know.

2604
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,000
But what do you think, though, did you buy Deus Ex on PC out of curiosity?

2605
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
No.

2606
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Okay, let's assume you had.

2607
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Yes.

2608
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Do you think you would have used that coupon for OnLive?

2609
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Probably not, no.

2610
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:21,000
I kind of theorized that I don't think that coupon's really that big a deal, because I think people are going to go use it to kind of check out OnLive and go, ooh, that's kind of neat, and play it for five minutes, and then be done with it, because the games don't really tie.

2611
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:27,000
It's not like, I don't know, Portal or something. I don't know, it's not as rich as that kind of connection.

2612
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:33,000
But it was just the whole thought that, oh my gosh, you're taking out a $50 coupon.

2613
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:41,000
And here's another thing, remember Valve did the same thing, I don't remember the big G having an issue with it.

2614
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:46,000
I don't believe the whole spin on how they had this agreement with Valve, you know?

2615
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Because to be perfectly honest, let's say Square Enix says, oh, because of this, we're no longer selling our products to you.

2616
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:02,000
And you know, since Square Enix is one of the big players out there, it would not surprise me if other manufacturers were like, you know?

2617
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:10,000
But that's a note, I don't think it's as easy as that, because, you know, Evil G, or as I like to call him, the Evil Genus.

2618
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:18,000
The Evil Genus has a huge hold on, you know, the share of the games that they push through is gigantic.

2619
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:25,000
True, but I prefer to call them gazpacho stop.

2620
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
I'm sure we could sit here and think of names all day.

2621
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I know.

2622
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Alright, alright. Do you have any other thoughts you want to get out before we let you go and get more calls?

2623
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
I've said my thoughts, and one more thing.

2624
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Yes.

2625
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Now, whenever they do these price drops, and I know on one episode Arrow was questioning about the whole DS price drop thing.

2626
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:55,000
By consumer law, if there is a price drop within 30 days of the price, wherever you bought it from, by law, they have to give you the difference.

2627
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
State or federal.

2628
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:57,000
State or federal.

2629
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,000
What?

2630
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:03,000
There's no if, ands, or buts about it. If there's a price drop within 30 days, they have to give you the difference.

2631
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,000
State or federal law.

2632
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,000
They don't.

2633
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,000
That doesn't sound like a law at all.

2634
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
That could be a state.

2635
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
It's consumer law. It's one of the things I had to learn about.

2636
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:14,000
But is that consumer law for New York, or is it for federal?

2637
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,000
That might be the deal, Rama. It might be, because I've never heard of that here either.

2638
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Well, I do know it's New York state law. Also, same thing in Jersey, Connecticut, and a bunch of other states.

2639
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:30,000
It would not surprise me if it was a federal law, but you know how some people do that whole federal law dance thing.

2640
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:34,000
It's one of those things we don't get out here on the West Coast, like hurricanes.

2641
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Which I slept through, by the way.

2642
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:45,000
I heard a lot of people did, but I don't mean to make light of a bad situation, because unfortunately, people in Vermont did not fare as well as people in New York City, from what I understand.

2643
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Pretty much.

2644
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Hope everybody's alright.

2645
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Alright, we're gonna let you go, Rama.

2646
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Thank you.

2647
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Alright, take care, buddy.

2648
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Alright, bye.

2649
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Bye.

2650
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Alright, I want to go to this aside real quick before we take another call. We've got more calls coming in, but I want to do this real quick.

2651
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Because we were talking about scary games earlier, and several people in the chatroom brought up Amnesia.

2652
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:09,000
And here's the thing, though. The story of The Dark Soccer Road was about 360 games, and Amnesia is a PC-only game.

2653
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
However, it goes without saying that Amnesia is a pretty scary game.

2654
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:16,000
And Salacious Pop has been telling me about reaction videos on YouTube.

2655
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
This is a big thing people like to do on YouTube, is reaction videos.

2656
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Like, I'm sure we've all seen, like, Grandma Watches Two Girls One Cup for the First Time reaction videos, right?

2657
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:28,000
But apparently there's reaction video of, like, frat boys playing Amnesia.

2658
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Well, I asked Salacious Pop to go find me some.

2659
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:35,000
So, I've never seen these. This could be a horrible statement.

2660
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:38,000
But I want to try playing one of these on air here.

2661
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,000
So, this is, um...

2662
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:40,000
What is this called here?

2663
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,000
I don't want your stupid advertisement. Let me get through the advertisement.

2664
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:47,000
This is Funny Freakouts here, to Amnesia.

2665
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:50,000
So, let me, um, get to this.

2666
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
And, uh, let's see.

2667
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
A Funtage, I guess they're calling this.

2668
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
I want to get to... He says a minute thirty-three.

2669
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
So, let me start it there.

2670
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Oh, shit!

2671
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Shut up, shut up!

2672
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:19,000
In there, in there!

2673
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Jump in, jump in! Close the door! Close the door! Close the door!

2674
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Close the door! Close the door!

2675
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Fuck!

2676
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
No! Don't think!

2677
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:32,000
Don't be crouched, crouched, crouched. Don't just...

2678
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Really carefully, carefully, guys.

2679
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Oh my god!

2680
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Shut up!

2681
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
Oh, oh, Jesus Christ!

2682
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Oh, Jesus Christ!

2683
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:43,000
No! No! Run! Run! Run!

2684
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Run! Where do I go?

2685
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
I hide in there! I hide over here!

2686
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:50,000
I love you!

2687
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Jesus!

2688
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Run!

2689
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:04,000
See, that's the problem, is that when you do 360 only games, you can't include amnesia.

2690
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
I don't want to pay twenty bucks for that.

2691
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Oh, I have amnesia. You should come over, and we should make a reaction video to amnesia.

2692
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Because we'll both scream like twelve-year-old girls, we will.

2693
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:16,000
I want it, but I don't want to pay twenty bucks for it.

2694
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
I have it. You should come over one night.

2695
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Like, we could do this on Halloween.

2696
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Okay.

2697
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:25,000
I was, I, who was I, were we talking about this at breakfast, or was I talking about with Salacious Pop?

2698
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I'm getting old, I forget things.

2699
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,000
We were talking about it this morning.

2700
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,000
We were talking about it at breakfast, because, uh, we were talking about Castlevania, or something.

2701
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Yeah.

2702
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:35,000
And I was like, no, we gotta play something really scary, we gotta play amnesia.

2703
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Which I have yet to, I bought it, but I haven't played it yet.

2704
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:40,000
So, like, you'd get some genuine reactions out of me.

2705
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Okay, I'll do that, I'll be down for that.

2706
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:53,000
We might have to have an OLR Halloween special, kind of like, like Nickelodeon would do the Mark Summers Halloween mansion or whatever.

2707
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:58,000
We'll have to do Amnesia Night with Dark Sakura, Rob Roberts, and maybe Loki.

2708
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:59,000
You hear?

2709
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
You know when I scream when my voice goes away?

2710
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Salacious Pop, be quiet.

2711
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Alright.

2712
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Let's get to some more calls.

2713
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
We've made these people wait through amnesia reaction videos.

2714
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2715
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Hey, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto, can you hear me?

2716
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Yes, we can. Hi, Kaijuto, what's up?

2717
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Hey, not much, I just wanted to tell you, Rob, last week you spoke about the game Covert Action.

2718
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Yes, Sid Meier's Covert Action.

2719
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Yeah, that was actually a favorite game.

2720
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
And that's the CIA calling you right now.

2721
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Hello?

2722
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Hi, we can hear you.

2723
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Okay, anyway, that was a favorite game of mine, too, and I found it about three years ago.

2724
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:47,000
You can play it for free online on the PC, and also, you might like this, you'll be able to play it on your Nintendo DS.

2725
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:48,000
What?

2726
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:49,000
If you have an R4 card.

2727
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:50,000
What?

2728
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,000
I actually play it while I'm in the bathroom.

2729
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:54,000
What?

2730
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Doing some espionage of your own.

2731
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where I do my best work, man.

2732
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:04,000
So yeah, if you have an R4 card, it's really simple, I'm pretty sure Loki can help you out.

2733
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:12,000
You get the R4 card, you get the Covert Action ROM somewhere online where you can find it, and then there's like some type of application.

2734
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:16,000
I think it, because I have a few of them on my R4, so I don't know which one it is.

2735
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:26,000
I think it's the Apple II emulator that you can put on your DS with the R4 that gives you the Covert Action, or it might be one of the others, but it's really easy to find.

2736
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Wow.

2737
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Interesting.

2738
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:30,000
I don't have an R4 cartridge.

2739
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,000
I have a spare R4.

2740
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:34,000
I'm saying maybe Loki will let me borrow one of his.

2741
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:35,000
That's awesome.

2742
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:36,000
I loved Covert Action.

2743
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,000
I don't know what it is about that game either.

2744
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Dude, Sid Meier, he's the man.

2745
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
He's just, he's played so many good games.

2746
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
And he doesn't like that game for some reason.

2747
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:49,000
I think you mentioned yesterday, people said that it was like too many games in one.

2748
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Sid Meier, that was actually Sid Meier said that they tried to do too much in one game.

2749
02:40:54,000 --> 02:41:05,000
It was like four separate games that none of them were really fully realized, and you know, and to be fair, the driving game was always kind of dumb anyway.

2750
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Like the best part was the actual one where you broke in to the facilities, and then there was the cryptogram, that's really easy, and then the switchboard puzzles, the logic puzzles.

2751
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:18,000
For the record, Civ V is on sale for 75% off right now.

2752
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
At the top of the show, where were you?

2753
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Not listening because I don't play Civ, but I'm repeating it.

2754
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Alright, fair enough. It's worth repeating.

2755
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:31,000
And my favorite part of the game was the fact that you can play it over and over again.

2756
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Like there's always like some type of game tree that you can follow that's never the same kind of like choose your own adventure looks.

2757
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:42,000
And that's what I liked about it the most, but definitely check it out.

2758
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:47,000
And the cool thing is that when you play the, remember the little top-down game where you're like running through the building?

2759
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Yeah, that part was like the best.

2760
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Yeah, that, with this hack on the DS, you could actually use the direction pad to play that version of the game.

2761
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:03,000
Now, ActDeftInChat says piracy lounge radio. No, no, I legit own this game back in the day, thank you very much.

2762
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:09,000
And just to let them know, the game is officially free online. It's not like you're pirating the game.

2763
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:12,000
There's somewhere where they provide it to you for free.

2764
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And also the Apple II emulator is just a free application for the R4, so it's not really any piracy going on.

2765
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Nice.

2766
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
This is all just like freeware that's available to you.

2767
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Oh, this just occurred to me. You know what covert action is like? It's like where in the world is Carmen Sandiego with guns?

2768
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Okay, this game looks awesome.

2769
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Oh, it's Cthulhu Saves the World.

2770
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Yeah, I've never played it.

2771
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Yeah, those are on Xbox Live in the marketplace.

2772
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:42,000
I'm going to hang up and let you get to your next call.

2773
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Thank you for being courteous, Kaijuto. That's very nice of you. Take care, buddy.

2774
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death 7 are three bucks.

2775
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Yeah, I want to say there was a story one week. I don't remember how long ago.

2776
02:42:54,000 --> 02:43:01,000
They sold more on Steam of those games in one weekend than they did the entire time the game was on Xbox Live in the arcade.

2777
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Wow.

2778
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:05,000
But of course, the games are really cheap. They're fun. They're cute.

2779
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:10,000
They're definitely a throwback to the old school Super Nintendo RPGs with humor.

2780
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:13,000
I like the Cthulhu one because Cthulhu is cute.

2781
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:17,000
So you have to check. Did you ever see Hello Cthulhu? Yes, I have.

2782
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
It's like the Hello Kitty doll, but it's Cthulhu.

2783
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Well, it's it's actually Cthulhu ending up in the Sanrio universe and corrupting Hello Kitty.

2784
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:27,000
They personally did like a few of them, but they're super funny.

2785
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Would that look like the Hello Kitty in the Ursula outfit doll that I bought Salacious Pop?

2786
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:38,000
No, it's just a super cute Cthulhu, like a little SD Sanrio-style Cthulhu hanging out with a goth-doubt kitty.

2787
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:42,000
I still really want you to have your World of Warcraft character named Ursulol.

2788
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Well, maybe I'll remake Fatty Cakes into Ursulol, but Fatty Cakes is a good name, too.

2789
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:48,000
I'll make Ursulol.

2790
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:51,000
All right, let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange and Orange Radio. Who's this?

2791
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Legend is off of you.

2792
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

2793
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Pretty good, as usual.

2794
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Good, good. What's up?

2795
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:13,000
I guess what I wanted to bring up was the fact that Activision is kind of like trying to get the folks currently on the fence like myself from Modern Warfare 3 on the PC by just like re-adding things that they took out.

2796
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Case in point, LAN support, in addition to adding dedicated servers.

2797
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:27,000
So it's like, I don't know, on one hand, they're trying to make amends, but on the other, you know, I have to believe it has to be like a bait and switch.

2798
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:31,000
Interesting, because I remember hearing that they took it out, but I did not hear about them putting it back in.

2799
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
That was for Modern Warfare 2.

2800
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Interesting.

2801
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Yeah, so Modern Warfare 3 will actually have LAN support.

2802
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Well, you know, Blizzard is a huge part of Activision, obviously, and they've come under fire lately because, what, Starcraft 2 does not have the LAN, and Diablo 3 is not going to have it either.

2803
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Yeah, they're all going to be online for better or for worse.

2804
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:58,000
I hate to say it, but I sort of support it with Diablo 3. I don't know.

2805
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Here's the thing, like, the thing with Diablo 3 is that, let's face it, Diablo 2 was hacked to hell and back, and it, like, you can't play that game online with strangers.

2806
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:09,000
It's so broken. You can really only play with people you trust.

2807
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:16,000
I think if they had kept, like, a LAN campaign separate from an online campaign, they could have done it, you know?

2808
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,000
It's kind of disappointing, but, eh, there's always Torchlight 2.

2809
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Well, that does help.

2810
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:26,000
The $20 price tag that was confirmed this week helps, too.

2811
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Right now, I guess I could, I'll probably give them the benefit of the doubt, but seeing that this is Activision and the fact that they reneged on it back in Modern Warfare 2, when they promised that they were going to have dedicated servers and so forth, only to find out a few weeks before launch that it was quite the opposite.

2812
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Right.

2813
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:50,000
So I don't want to, it's like, I don't want to get fooled again.

2814
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Um, what did you think of the whole Call of Duty expo that they did, the Call of Duty XP or whatever?

2815
02:45:55,000 --> 02:46:01,000
I heard bits and pieces, like, people actually doing paintball matches to some of the maps in there.

2816
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:09,000
I mean, it's like, I guess they're trying to hype it up to the point where, you know, it's all marketing at this point.

2817
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:28,000
I mean, the idea is that Call of Duty is for, you know, quote unquote, kind of like the douchebags game of choice in that regard, whereas Battlefield 3 is mostly for the hardcore, the hardcore nerd gamer that plays these types of FPSs like Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike.

2818
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:34,000
That's the type of, that's the type of demographic I see EA targeting, you know, with BF3.

2819
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Right.

2820
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:45,000
Whereas Call of Duty is kind of like the dumbed down, basic, um, that's like the one that they're trying to get everyone on board with.

2821
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:48,000
It was like a frat boy type game.

2822
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:53,000
I know I'm generalizing and you can, you know, you can sue me if you want, but I'm just...

2823
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:54,000
No, it's fine.

2824
02:46:54,000 --> 02:47:01,000
I'm so uneducated on all those games and it's not that I dislike them, they're just not my thing and I'm stuck at them.

2825
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:02,000
I'm so terrible at them.

2826
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:09,000
It's like some people in DDR, some people think DDR is just, what the hell is that music that's coming out of that machine, you know, and not everybody gets it.

2827
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Right, right, but I mean, I guess what Activision is banking on is the mere fact that they can sell a shitload of copies of that game, of Modern Warfare, without having to change a lot.

2828
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:35,000
And hoping that, you know, as long as you hype it up to the point where they kind of need to have it or else they're going to be the, you know, the unluckiest kid in the block without their copy of Call of Duty.

2829
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:48,000
It's kind of like they're trying to create a mindset where you have to one-up your friend or your neighbors and get, you know, and covet that copy of Call of Duty that he has.

2830
02:47:48,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Whereas Battlefield 3, on the other hand, is going for more detail, more replay, more, let's just say, a lot more features than what Activision is offering.

2831
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Let's be real.

2832
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Actually, it's aiming towards being a simulator.

2833
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Let's be real.

2834
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,000
A military simulator.

2835
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Let's be real. Aren't most people just going to get both?

2836
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Yeah, you're right, they're going to get both, but I could see a lot of those, you know, uneducated, regular token gamers.

2837
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:19,000
They're going to just get Modern Warfare 3.

2838
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Like the really hardcore ones, they're going to get both.

2839
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:25,000
They're going to balance time in between the two.

2840
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Yeah.

2841
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:30,000
It's kind of like there's so much I want to play this holiday season.

2842
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Well, isn't that the case every holiday?

2843
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Somehow I will have to juggle my time between Skyrim, Diablo 3, Torchlight 2, and God knows it all, I'm forgetting, the Mario Kart on the 3DS.

2844
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:44,000
I thought Diablo 3 wasn't coming out this year.

2845
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,000
I think it will.

2846
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:51,000
They haven't said one way or the other, but the friends and family beta is going on right now, which means the public beta is probably next month.

2847
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:55,000
I think they're going to announce at BlizzCon that it's coming out within the next month.

2848
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Why wouldn't they try to make End of Year and have a huge thing?

2849
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Because Blizzard hasn't released anything else this year.

2850
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:04,000
They don't release Diablo, they've released nothing.

2851
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:10,000
And they still have to get the expansion pack for Starcraft 2, which is probably next year anyways.

2852
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:11,000
That's probably next year.

2853
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Actually, I didn't make the show world, but there was a story, Blizzard has committed to six games in familiar IPs over the next three years.

2854
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:28,000
And most people are speculating that's the two Starcraft 2, Diablo 3 and an expansion, and two WoW expansions.

2855
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
That's it?

2856
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:31,000
Which makes sense.

2857
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:36,000
And most of them are going to, and pretty much all of them are going to be on PC unless they do like second hand ports.

2858
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:41,000
I guarantee Diablo 3 will end up on consoles, it's just not going to be the same time as PC.

2859
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Yeah, and this is why you always want to, with Blizzard it's always PC or nothing.

2860
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:55,000
People forget, Diablo was on the Playstation, Starcraft was on the 64, well some things are better left forgotten.

2861
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Yeah, some things are better left forgotten than Blizzard's half-assed ports of their properties back in the day.

2862
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Warcraft comes to mind.

2863
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:10,000
It's been 15 years since Diablo on the Playstation 1, so you know, it's worth a try.

2864
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:13,000
See, I enjoyed it on my PC, enough said.

2865
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show and have fun.

2866
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Alright, take care buddy.

2867
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Have a good one.

2868
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:24,000
I think he's going to be broke this holiday season too, I forgot to ask him how much money he plans to spend.

2869
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Alright, sadly that's going to do it for the Skyplan.

2870
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:29,000
I want someone with money to get me a Moonkin hatchling.

2871
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
They're what, 10 bucks?

2872
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Yeah.

2873
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Not too bad. But it's virtual pets.

2874
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:37,000
I know. That's what I said, I want someone else to get it.

2875
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:40,000
How about I donate $10 to a charity in your honor?

2876
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Okay.

2877
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Alright.

2878
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Dude, what the hell?

2879
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Alright, moving on, I want to finish up the tweet so we can finish up the show tonight.

2880
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
We just had a handful of other tweets.

2881
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:54,000
An interesting one from Tigerclaw, tweeting OLR at twitter.com slash OLR.

2882
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Study suggests virtual goods purchasing differs by ethnicity.

2883
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:06,000
Oh boy, this could be a, alright, let's see what this is all about.

2884
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:12,000
This is a report for, this is an article from Gamasutra that we were linked to on twitter by user Tigerclaw305.

2885
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:20,000
New study published Friday by mobile game community MocoSpace suggests that virtual goods purchasing behavior may be affected by ethnicity.

2886
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:29,000
A survey of anonymous data from 40,000 mobile social gamers revealed that both Caucasians and African Americans over indexed on virtual goods spendings.

2887
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Caucasians in particular were responsible for 26% of virtual goods purchases made during the study period, despite representing only 18% of those studied.

2888
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:44,000
African Americans made up 36% of the respondents and made 38% of the purchases.

2889
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Those calling those Hispanic under indexed despite compromising 31% of the sample pool, they made only 21% of the purchases.

2890
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Alright, what does this all mean? You know, numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers. What does this mean?

2891
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:04,000
According to MocoSpace CEO Justin Siegel, the rapid growth of virtual goods industry means that it, quote, makes sense to really start segmenting it.

2892
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Quote, we've started to sort our data by a number of criteria, including ethnicity and gender.

2893
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:22,000
Over time, this sort of information will change how mobile game developers and publishers create content and market their titles, something that already happening in console and online gaming industry.

2894
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:34,000
I'm not really understanding, like, how, but whatever. People get paid to break that data down, just so you know. Somebody got paid to do that study.

2895
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Last tweet to us tonight from WatchDragon. Beat Space Marine on hard. What is Space Marine? Is that just Halo?

2896
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:45,000
No, it's Warhammer 4K Space Marine.

2897
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Aha! That would explain the rest of this tweet. I play the tabletop Warhammer. It's true to the story and fluff.

2898
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:59,000
And fluff. Very cool. Thank you for educating me, Loki, because I did not pick that up.

2899
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:05,000
I did not play Warhammer tabletop. The only Warhammer I've ever played was that MMO they put out a couple years ago.

2900
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
You played Warhammer tabletop, didn't you, Darkseid?

2901
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Hell no. I dated someone who did.

2902
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,000
Oh, that's-

2903
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,000
So sick of those stupid little-

2904
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:15,000
Oh, you had figurine trauma in that relationship.

2905
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:16,000
Yes, because-

2906
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:20,000
I tried playing Warhammer 4K Space Marine.

2907
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Did you?

2908
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:32,000
Warhammer 4K Space Marine was more of the larger scale battles, smaller scale figurines. The actual Space Marines were 6mm tall figurines.

2909
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:38,000
I did not paint those. I tried painting them and I'm like, fuck that. It's too damn small.

2910
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Alright.

2911
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:43,000
And I threw it all away. Because I'm like, I don't get this game.

2912
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:48,000
I haven't played Dungeons and Dragons in like four years. I should play some time. I don't know. I just sound like a total nerd.

2913
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Maybe I didn't throw it away. I think I might have it in a box somewhere.

2914
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:58,000
Alright. That does it for Twitter topics tonight. Tweet us for next week. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2915
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Let's go to Loki and see if he has any last minute stories.

2916
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Um, just real quick. Rookies won't appear in NBA 2K12 until lockout's over.

2917
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:11,000
So, there's gonna be an update or something like that for free once-

2918
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:12,000
Lockouts are ruining everything.

2919
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Once that happens, you won't be able to play as, you know, till it happens you won't be able to play as the rookies.

2920
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Um, there's some mysterious move game in development from the people that did Linker in Shadows.

2921
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Remember that really weird dog flying thing with the basset hound and the shadow creatures that look like the squid from The Matrix or whatever?

2922
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Actually, I don't remember that and it's probably for the best.

2923
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Probably is kinda artsy. Um, so now they have a teaser, uh, trailer thing on YouTube.

2924
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:47,000
I don't even know if it's really a teaser, but it's a thing called the Odd Forest.

2925
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:54,000
And it basically looks like some sort of move game where you're interacting with objects by touching them and stuff.

2926
02:54:54,000 --> 02:55:05,000
I would almost go and say, you know, they could very well be like trying to put some sort of, you know, touch sensitive glove or something in play.

2927
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Cause it's almost like all this stuff is just, you know, focusing on the textures of different things and obviously with the movie you're not gonna be able to feel any of that.

2928
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:19,000
So, I don't know. But right now, weird video that's online so you can check it out.

2929
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:24,000
And that's pretty much it.

2930
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Alright, well this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2931
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:32,000
So, Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. Your final thought tonight?

2932
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Duffy.

2933
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:41,000
My final thought tonight is tacos! Again. And baking cupcakes causing sugar headaches.

2934
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Those cupcakes single-handedly are gonna make me diabetic.

2935
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:44,000
I have a sugar headache right now.

2936
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:48,000
I know, right? That's why I ran to get water during one of the reports. Crazy.

2937
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Anyway, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2938
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:57,000
My final thought is I made a flamethrower in Grand Theft Auto. And no one else has.

2939
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
And happy birthday once again.

2940
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:00,000
Thank you.

2941
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
So, hope you had a good one.
