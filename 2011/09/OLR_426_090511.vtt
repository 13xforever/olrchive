00:00.000 --> 00:19.200
Tonight, September 4th, 2011, a former QA tester sues one developer.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.420
Details on Dragon Quest X are soon to be revealed.

00:22.420 --> 00:32.120
Will there soon be a museum dedicated to video games?

00:32.120 --> 00:36.280
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of that show

00:36.280 --> 00:38.440
where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.360
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.360
We are live.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.680
It is Sunday, September the 4th of 2011.

00:43.680 --> 00:49.240
It's Labor Day weekend and we're live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com where we are

00:49.240 --> 00:53.920
live every week at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show,

00:53.920 --> 00:54.920
although not tonight.

00:54.920 --> 00:55.920
He had the night off.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.640
He's at Dragon Con and I know he's going to have a full report on all of that next week.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.720
In the meantime, let me introduce who we have here in studio.

01:01.720 --> 01:05.000
My name is Rob Roberts and not joining me tonight, sadly.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.760
I know this might come as a surprise, but Dark Sakura is not here.

01:08.760 --> 01:09.760
She has the night off.

01:09.760 --> 01:10.880
She's in San Francisco.

01:10.880 --> 01:15.020
If you guys know Maren from Las Vegas, she's in town visiting San Francisco.

01:15.020 --> 01:21.680
So they're doing girly things in the city like going to have shrimp at Pier 39 and then

01:21.680 --> 01:25.240
pillow fights and braiding each other's hair and chocolate sundaes and all that.

01:25.240 --> 01:29.320
So filling in tonight as hosts, we have a guest who used to come to the show all the

01:29.320 --> 01:31.040
time then has been taking a little break.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.520
So say hello, welcome back, whatever the case may be to Salacious Pop.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.520
Hello.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.680
How are you doing tonight Salacious Pop?

01:36.680 --> 01:37.680
I'm doing great.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.960
So, okay, for the listeners that don't know you, well, let me introduce, I'll come back

01:40.960 --> 01:44.340
to you in a minute, but also it just wouldn't be a night at OLR without the one and only

01:44.340 --> 01:45.340
tech master, Loki.

01:45.340 --> 01:46.340
Hello.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.340
And everyone was wrong.

01:47.340 --> 01:52.180
It was a big, and Loki, oh my gosh, we're having so much feeling that you're not plugged

01:52.180 --> 01:53.180
in tonight.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.180
Loki.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.760
We're having a little bit of fail tonight and I'll get to that in a minute.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.760
I'm sure everybody's like tonight.

01:58.760 --> 01:59.760
What is that?

01:59.760 --> 02:00.760
Every night you have all our fail.

02:00.760 --> 02:01.760
Okay.

02:01.760 --> 02:02.760
Try again.

02:02.760 --> 02:03.760
Look.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.760
All right.

02:04.760 --> 02:05.760
Tech master Loki.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.760
And everybody had it wrong.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.760
It wasn't anything.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.760
It wasn't double bacon strips.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.640
It was a double Western bacon cheeseburger from Carl's Jr or Hardee's I guess on the

02:10.640 --> 02:11.680
East coast.

02:11.680 --> 02:16.080
And he is talking to chat.orangelandtrader.com, our live chat room where we are live every

02:16.080 --> 02:17.080
week.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.680
Come join us sometime for a live show.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.520
Although I will say tonight was, you know, usually the podcast people are like, man,

02:22.520 --> 02:26.640
we get shafted because the live listeners, they get the music breaks and the live listeners

02:26.640 --> 02:31.000
get that little bonus segment at the very end that isn't on the podcast and so on.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.240
Live listeners make out well tonight, podcast listeners, you got the better end of the deal

02:35.240 --> 02:39.280
because we are 25 minutes late and starting tonight and the live listeners have been waiting.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.920
It's a very struggling evening.

02:40.920 --> 02:41.920
Yes.

02:41.920 --> 02:42.920
And we've just had tech.

02:42.920 --> 02:43.920
We've had tech fail.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.000
We've had can't get into the studio when Jamie's not here fail.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.200
We've just had all sorts of problems.

02:49.200 --> 02:54.920
So I apologize, but, um, we'll find our rhythm eventually and, and put on a show.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.360
So Dan is yelling at us in the living room to quit complaining.

02:59.360 --> 03:03.680
So anyway, uh, let's go back to Salacious Pop and, um, you're here, but you haven't

03:03.680 --> 03:04.680
been here a little while.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.080
When was the last time you were on the show?

03:06.080 --> 03:09.300
I want to say it was either April or before.

03:09.300 --> 03:13.880
I think it's kind of funny that, uh, now that I actually live up in Sacramento where Studio

03:13.880 --> 03:20.340
OLR is roughly, um, I'm on the show far less than I was before, even though I'm living

03:20.340 --> 03:21.480
with one of the co-hosts.

03:21.480 --> 03:25.320
So for those that are new to Orange Lawn Radio, maybe haven't heard you on the show before,

03:25.320 --> 03:26.960
tell us a little bit about yourself.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.840
Like what, what kind of games are you into?

03:28.840 --> 03:29.840
What do you like?

03:29.840 --> 03:32.940
Uh, I've been gaming since I was four or five.

03:32.940 --> 03:35.880
My first system was an Atari 2600.

03:35.880 --> 03:41.240
Um, most of my gaming was probably done during the SNES and PS1 generations.

03:41.240 --> 03:46.640
I own all the systems and have a ton of games, but I don't really console game much anymore.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.520
I'm mostly a PC gamer.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.120
I mostly, I'm more into gaming culture.

03:51.120 --> 03:56.920
Um, those are my people, but as far as actually sitting down when we'll get to this, when

03:56.920 --> 04:01.660
we get to my, um, gaming week, don't really play as much as I used to.

04:01.660 --> 04:05.320
What do you mean by like gaming culture and those are my people when you say that?

04:05.320 --> 04:09.520
Just the various fandoms and, you know, following the sort of, you know, I still follow the

04:09.520 --> 04:13.760
news for games that I know I'm not going to play, but I still find it interesting and

04:13.760 --> 04:14.760
yeah.

04:14.760 --> 04:18.480
So, but, but there are some games you still do play today, right?

04:18.480 --> 04:19.480
Of course.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.480
Of course.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.080
You still have all the, you have all the systems, 360, PS3, right?

04:23.080 --> 04:24.080
Yep.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.080
The only one I didn't get this generation was the Wii.

04:26.080 --> 04:32.480
So top, not missing much, uh, top three games ever, not to put you on the spot or anything,

04:32.480 --> 04:37.400
but three, if you can't think of your top three, just like three really freaking great

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
games.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.400
Super Metroid.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.400
Good pick.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.400
Valkyrie profile.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.160
That's a good pick too.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.760
And street fighter alpha two.

04:45.760 --> 04:50.400
Ooh, why alpha two and not just straight up two, which is the most notable, I suppose.

04:50.400 --> 04:58.960
I think the alpha or zero series is the best street fighter has ever been as far as art

04:58.960 --> 05:03.360
design play style, combo system, music, everything.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.000
Dan came in here and give the big thumbs up.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.080
I think all is forgiven now.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.480
All right.

05:09.480 --> 05:13.680
So a welcome once again, salacious pop, and I know you have some, uh, big shoes to fill

05:13.680 --> 05:18.000
and a you're even putting on the heels tonight just to, uh, fill in for dark soccer.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
No, I'm kidding.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I'm kidding.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.600
But you will pet Shermie and plays a dark soccer.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.600
I'm sure.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
Yes.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.600
Sure.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.600
Me is still here.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.600
Sassy in her kitty bed is always pet.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.600
Sure.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.600
Me instead of dark Sakura.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.600
What?

05:29.600 --> 05:30.600
That's what it sounds like.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.280
Cause in place of dark Sakura, Oh, shut up.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.280
All right.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.280
Anyhow.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.280
You guys are crazy.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.280
All right.

05:38.280 --> 05:42.400
We're going to get into how was your gaming week, but first we weren't here last week.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.240
Not only have we had a little bit of fail and, and, uh, starting a little late tonight,

05:46.240 --> 05:48.600
but we were not here at all last week.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.920
Um, salacious pop and I were at Disneyland, which was awesome.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.440
I don't have to tell you twice.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.440
Yep.

05:55.440 --> 06:00.880
There's a lot of lolsy, funny stuff about the electronica event that happens at Disneyland.

06:00.880 --> 06:05.440
Because if you guys don't know what electronica is, it happens, um, at Disneyland, uh, California

06:05.440 --> 06:10.760
venture, the second park down there, Westcott, if you will, uh, it is, uh, an event that

06:10.760 --> 06:11.760
happens at night.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.960
Which is becoming more like the first park, to be honest.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.920
Well, they, they, they're getting more of the thrill rides and so forth, and they're

06:16.920 --> 06:21.360
doing this huge make over there and cars land and the most expensive ride they've ever done

06:21.360 --> 06:24.280
is supposed to be at that park, but that's to get people to go there because a lot of

06:24.280 --> 06:25.280
people weren't going there.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.280
One of the things they do is electronica.

06:26.280 --> 06:29.880
And we've talked about this on the show before, uh, go back to the E3 shows this year, because

06:29.880 --> 06:32.360
we took Bobby, uh, for the first time to electronica.

06:32.360 --> 06:37.120
They have a replica Flynn's arcade, where, uh, all the arcade machines from the 80s,

06:37.120 --> 06:39.920
and they work great, because if they don't work great, they take them out.

06:39.920 --> 06:43.080
We saw him removing a machine, which I thought was kind of funny, like-

06:43.080 --> 06:44.840
Taking it out back to shoot it.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.360
Apparently, apparently, I don't know what they do, but yeah, they have to take the machine

06:48.360 --> 06:49.680
out of there, because they won't have any-

06:49.680 --> 06:52.840
So he's a bit loose, take her out back, put her out of her misery.

06:52.840 --> 06:53.840
Fail machines.

06:53.840 --> 06:58.040
And, uh, you know, all these cool little Tron decorations, and people dressed up in Tron

06:58.040 --> 07:02.800
gear, and they're basically having like a giant rave, and, uh, playing like Daft Punk

07:02.800 --> 07:03.800
and that sort of music.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.840
I don't know, am I, am I saying everything correctly here, Salacious Pop, about electronica?

07:06.840 --> 07:08.440
Yeah, sounds about right.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.920
So we love electronica, because we're nerds, and we love Tron.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.280
Like Tron is like one of the greatest Disney products there is, right?

07:15.280 --> 07:19.360
Electronica was not supposed to be at the park anymore, it was supposed to finish not

07:19.360 --> 07:23.040
long after the movie came out, and it's been extended time and time and time again.

07:23.040 --> 07:27.980
And the most recent news on the net was it's being extended through spring 2012, which

07:27.980 --> 07:34.000
that's great news, because, uh, that means, uh, you can enjoy Flynn's arcade, and the,

07:34.000 --> 07:38.560
you know, perfect 80s actual arcade machines for just that much longer, and those of us

07:38.560 --> 07:41.520
that are nerds and huge fans of Tron's are happy.

07:41.520 --> 07:47.080
But while we were at the park, I was talking to an employee kind of candidly about electronica,

07:47.080 --> 07:51.440
and he said, well yeah, you know, it's closing after Labor Day, and we were like, what?

07:51.440 --> 07:54.560
It's closing after Labor Day, but we heard it was spring 2012, and we have like all these

07:54.560 --> 07:58.080
people that we know that are coming to the park in October, like just to go to electronica

07:58.080 --> 08:00.160
and check it out before it closes.

08:00.160 --> 08:04.880
And he was like, well yeah, it's closing after Labor Day, and it's, you know, it's probably

08:04.880 --> 08:06.360
going to come back in a different configuration.

08:06.360 --> 08:11.960
And we were like, oh my gosh, so making posts to Facebook, angry friends making comments

08:11.960 --> 08:14.360
about how could electronica close before they see it.

08:14.360 --> 08:18.360
It was like telling a bunch of preschoolers that Santa Claus had died.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.360
Yeah, basically.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.160
They were like, what, no!

08:21.160 --> 08:25.080
It was, yeah, or just like just slapping ice cream out of their hand.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.080
Same reaction.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.080
What is that?

08:27.080 --> 08:28.080
What is that thing?

08:28.080 --> 08:29.080
Coning or whatever.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.040
It's like that where you grab the top of the cone, that dumbass thing.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.040
So it was stupid.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.720
Yes, it was.

08:33.720 --> 08:40.640
So anyhow, to make a long story short, too late, I know, we found out that yes, a lot

08:40.640 --> 08:46.000
of electronica is closing after Labor Day, but for three weeks, then it's coming back

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
weekends only.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.120
You have to understand, they're putting electronica in the Disney vault, and then they're going

08:51.120 --> 08:56.600
to re-release it later on as a special edition, because that's what Disney does with everything.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.220
So finally, we figured that out.

08:58.220 --> 09:01.480
So my friends that are going to the park in October are happy because they'll get to see

09:01.480 --> 09:04.760
it because they're going on a weekend, so it doesn't matter that it's weekends only.

09:04.760 --> 09:05.760
It's fine.

09:05.760 --> 09:10.920
Nick Latov was going to be going the week before it reopens, and now he's pissed.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.120
So I'm not supposed to probably be talking about that on the show, but oh well, what

09:14.120 --> 09:15.120
are you going to do?

09:15.120 --> 09:21.080
And look at that, he just joined chat to stomp and pout with our chatters at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

09:21.080 --> 09:27.280
So, yeah, so we had fun at Disneyland and electronica and all that, and so that's where

09:27.280 --> 09:30.680
we were last week, and we just ended up having the show off, because Jamie was helping a

09:30.680 --> 09:34.680
friend move, and you know, Logie's got the kids, so he enjoys a week off.

09:34.680 --> 09:38.840
When electronica reopens after this three week renovation or whatever, it's going to

09:38.840 --> 09:40.560
be smaller, right?

09:40.560 --> 09:42.600
Because of all the construction they're doing, or was that just a-

09:42.600 --> 09:43.600
Oh, probably.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.600
California Adventure's a mess right now.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.440
And Flynn's Arcade, is that still going to be there, or do you think they're taking that

09:47.440 --> 09:48.440
out?

09:48.440 --> 09:49.440
I hope they don't take it out.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.160
I don't know how it ties back into gaming, because I'll tell you what, if you're in Southern

09:52.160 --> 09:57.280
California, I do think you need to see electronica at least once, because that arcade is awesome.

09:57.280 --> 10:00.160
It's like, it's just like the arcade in the movie, and all the machines actually work,

10:00.160 --> 10:03.200
and how often do you get to go to an arcade where the machines freaking work?

10:03.200 --> 10:05.920
That's when Starrcade is ruined, they should make it permanent.

10:05.920 --> 10:08.440
Dan is saying since Starrcade is ruined, they should just make it permanent.

10:08.440 --> 10:09.440
They should.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.880
They should move Flynn's into Starrcade.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.560
But here's the rumors about the replacement.

10:12.560 --> 10:16.480
I don't mean to turn this into a Disney podcast, but deal.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.480
They're going to replace electronica with the mad tea party.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.480
Based off of the Tim Burton.

10:21.480 --> 10:25.340
Based off of the terrible Tim Burton version of Alice in Wonderland.

10:25.340 --> 10:28.400
But if you think about it, it's going to be so easy to convert.

10:28.400 --> 10:34.320
All they have to do, get Zeus a mad hatter outfit, get all the dancers little, you know,

10:34.320 --> 10:39.160
wacky colors and stuff, and then close Flynn's Arcade or turn it into a tea room or something.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.680
I hope that doesn't happen.

10:40.680 --> 10:44.920
I think Flynn's Arcade should stay a fixture, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

10:44.920 --> 10:49.920
Well, they need to move Flynn's Arcade to the part that's next to Space Mountain.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.360
Because they're used to have Tron stuff in Tomorrowland.

10:52.360 --> 10:56.000
Well, you see, here's the thing, though, is that since Star Tours is all new, they want

10:56.000 --> 10:58.340
all that business in the area or what have you.

10:58.340 --> 10:59.340
So I don't know.

10:59.340 --> 11:00.340
It would be nice.

11:00.340 --> 11:06.160
But sadly, there's just not a lot of arcade love in the world anymore.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.840
And I think that even at Disneyland you're seeing it.

11:07.840 --> 11:12.560
Get rid of that stupid, imaginary, spinning piece of crap that was there.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.020
How fucking badass would it be?

11:14.020 --> 11:19.640
If they would take that dome and turn it into some type of, like, light disc battle.

11:19.640 --> 11:20.640
Like a battle arena.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.240
Like a Tron battle arena.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.760
Where there could be a ride where you go around in a little light bike or something and it

11:25.760 --> 11:26.760
could just be all neon inside.

11:26.760 --> 11:31.140
I mean, it would cost hella money to renovate that place, but it would be awesome.

11:31.140 --> 11:33.080
Like a battle grid or something in Tomorrowland.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.080
It would be so badass.

11:34.080 --> 11:38.000
Or it would have been even more badass as if, well, I know people keep killing themselves

11:38.000 --> 11:41.760
on the goddamn rides, but like, remember when they had the rocket rods and stuff like that

11:41.760 --> 11:45.040
and it would go around on that, make that as a Tron.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.920
In the 80s, it was a Tron thing.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.920
The people mover had a Tron tunnel.

11:48.920 --> 11:49.920
The light speed Tron tunnel.

11:49.920 --> 11:50.920
Yeah, I remember that.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.920
Back when the first Tron movie was new.

11:52.920 --> 11:53.920
So it was very old.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.100
I remember that, but remember the rocket rods went really fast.

11:56.100 --> 12:01.820
So have like some sort of motorcycle ride thing that'd be sweet.

12:01.820 --> 12:06.800
And you can find Marvel merchandise at Disneyland now because of, you know, not really a merger.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.800
They bought Marvel outright.

12:07.800 --> 12:08.800
Right, yeah.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.720
In a lot of the Disney merch stores, you can find Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, action

12:12.720 --> 12:16.120
figures, the three 16 week games, all that stuff.

12:16.120 --> 12:20.040
So we're going to see some of those themed rides because you know how like all these

12:20.040 --> 12:21.960
Six Flags stuff have the DC rides.

12:21.960 --> 12:22.960
Yeah, that's right.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.320
They have the Superman and Superman, Batman and all.

12:26.320 --> 12:30.580
I again, I don't mean to turn this into a Disney podcast, but whatever.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.720
It's an off night tonight anyway.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.720
Here's the thing.

12:33.720 --> 12:37.940
I think if Disney ever does do a third gate in Anaheim, which they have the space for,

12:37.940 --> 12:40.320
but it would mean California Adventure has got to be successful.

12:40.320 --> 12:44.200
I think if they do a third park, they might do like a third park about like Marvel stuff

12:44.200 --> 12:46.640
and it could even be a thrill ride park to compete with Magic Mountain.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.640
But I don't know.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.460
I'm not going to hold my breath.

12:49.460 --> 12:52.940
And the Disney doesn't really have thrill parks because they're not very family friendly,

12:52.940 --> 12:53.940
but I don't know.

12:53.940 --> 12:54.940
I think one could be successful there.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.840
I think that's what kind of California Adventure is kind of, it started off as, okay, we're

12:58.840 --> 13:01.640
going to try everything that didn't really kind of fit in Disneyland.

13:01.640 --> 13:07.040
And now it's like, ah, we need more Disneyland in here.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.560
Coming to our chat room for some comments, the chat.orangelandtrady.com, at least the

13:09.560 --> 13:11.160
chatters are into this tonight.

13:11.160 --> 13:14.640
Tiger Claw says they will bring Electronica back when Tron 3 comes out.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.040
You know, that's a distinct possibility.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.960
I hope to God it's true they're making a Tron 3.

13:18.960 --> 13:24.160
I heard the Bruce Boxliner interview that 2013, and they certainly have loaded it and

13:24.160 --> 13:26.220
set it up for one in the Blu-ray.

13:26.220 --> 13:29.600
So I really hope that does happen.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.560
Dark Tetsuya says Rob should work for Disney Imagineering.

13:32.560 --> 13:36.520
Act Def says if any Disney employee is listening, they should hire Rob as an Imagineer.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.520
Oh, I would love that.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.320
In fact, I would just turn everything into Tron in Tomorrowland.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.800
Hey, I'm down.

13:41.800 --> 13:42.800
Autotopia, Nickatron.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.640
I can Imagineer like Space Mountain Tron.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.360
I can Imagineer like anything.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.600
I mean, just whatever you need, I'll Imagineer.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.600
Build it?

13:51.600 --> 13:56.040
No, I'm not really good at doing that part, but hell, I can imagine all sorts of crazy

13:56.040 --> 13:57.040
things.

13:57.040 --> 14:00.080
Okay, the last thing I'll say on Disney, Frisbee in our chat room at chat.orangelandtrady.com

14:00.080 --> 14:04.080
says and have Rob host the new Disney podcast, Orange Lounge Disneyel.

14:04.080 --> 14:07.440
Well, you know, we've been teasing the idea of a third podcast for a while and I will

14:07.440 --> 14:08.440
say this isn't it.

14:08.440 --> 14:12.200
But one of the ideas that was tossed around was doing like a Disney type podcast.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.180
But the problem with that is that Disney is supposed to be a very family friendly thing.

14:16.180 --> 14:18.840
And we have a lot of very foul mouths around.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.400
So I don't know if the two worlds would combine very well.

14:21.400 --> 14:26.880
I think there would be a niche audience for a Disney mature podcast like, you know, fuck

14:26.880 --> 14:30.440
the kids Disneyland's for me like that would probably be the name of it.

14:30.440 --> 14:34.000
But I don't know how well that would do and how much Disney would approve of something

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
like that.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.720
So didn't happen.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.200
Disneyland's just something we really like.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.200
So anyhow, let's go back to games.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.620
So we were off for a week.

14:42.620 --> 14:47.120
So we don't have a lot of news in the show world tonight about what happened last week.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.840
But I've got to talk about must say PAX happened.

14:49.840 --> 14:53.760
But I don't think that was really PAX happened and surprisingly not a ton of news out of

14:53.760 --> 14:54.760
PAX.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.520
I mean, a lot of it was seen and so forth.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.520
Yes.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.080
And expansions, a few things like that.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.260
But nothing major.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.160
And I was proven wrong.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.000
You know, games analysts aren't always right.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.600
I thought for sure Nintendo would announce those games, Xenoblade and so forth coming

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
out here.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.040
They did not take the opportunity to at PAX.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.040
I don't think it's happened.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.600
They didn't do much of anything at PAX, did they?

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
No.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.360
In fact, I didn't really hear even what they were showing at their booth.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.320
I imagine it was all the 3DS stuff.

15:17.320 --> 15:18.480
That's got to be what they were.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.600
Well, they announced what some new 3DS stuff.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.000
But we'll get into that later.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.060
And then yeah, it's it's pretty and it's funny is they haven't really even announced the

15:29.060 --> 15:31.960
dates yet for the two Mario games on the 3DS.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.440
It's just we know it's November, December.

15:34.440 --> 15:39.480
But you know, they've already announced everything up through the end of November.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.480
Where are those titles?

15:40.480 --> 15:45.680
Oh, well, we'll we'll come back to that, you know, figure it out, you know, see how well

15:45.680 --> 15:47.520
these other games do.

15:47.520 --> 15:52.800
So the big news that happened last week was about a company I've been critical of on this

15:52.800 --> 15:53.800
show in the past.

15:53.800 --> 15:54.800
It was GameStop.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.640
As I like I like Bobby's name for him.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.000
I think I might Jack the name Evil G is what he always calls him on the show.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
I might call him that.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.120
But I don't mean to disrespect the people working the front lines at the stores and

16:04.120 --> 16:05.120
so forth.

16:05.120 --> 16:09.360
Because, you know, I understand those of you that make very little money serving the customer

16:09.360 --> 16:16.120
directly are in a very thankless job and my beef with Evil G is not with those people.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.720
Although I some do get a bad rap and I have been to some stores where those guys are a

16:19.720 --> 16:20.720
holes.

16:20.720 --> 16:21.920
But that's not my beef.

16:21.920 --> 16:25.800
My beef with GameStop has to do with a much higher management and some of the ways some

16:25.800 --> 16:28.240
of the decisions they make and some of the ways that they run their company.

16:28.240 --> 16:31.900
And funny enough a lot of that came to light this last week.

16:31.900 --> 16:35.760
I'm sure I don't need to report this I'm sure all of you have heard this or read it on a

16:35.760 --> 16:36.760
gaming blog somewhere.

16:36.760 --> 16:40.460
But if you've been living in a cave I'll kind of sum it up for you.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.640
New game was released last week.

16:42.640 --> 16:46.520
I always say Deus Ex but it's Deus Ex Deus Ex.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.960
And the PC version came out and it was announced on the Internet about two days before it came

16:49.960 --> 16:54.240
out that it was going to come with a coupon so you get the game for free on on live which

16:54.240 --> 16:59.160
of course is the streaming service that everybody laughed at three years ago until they showed

16:59.160 --> 17:03.840
up at E3 and was like no really people you're going to stream these games over the Internet

17:03.840 --> 17:04.840
and it fucking works.

17:04.840 --> 17:07.840
And everybody's like holy fuck it does work.

17:07.840 --> 17:11.800
Now on live's biggest challenge is they have no games like they have very few games on

17:11.800 --> 17:12.800
their service.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.360
But to get a new game like Deus Ex is a big coup for them.

17:16.360 --> 17:19.660
So they want to show off their service try to get more people on on live and get people

17:19.660 --> 17:21.080
buying games over there.

17:21.080 --> 17:24.600
So they put in a coupon some type of partnership with Square Enix where you would be able to

17:24.600 --> 17:28.320
get a free version of Deus Ex on on live with the PC version.

17:28.320 --> 17:33.000
Well Evil G didn't like that because Evil G just recently bought one of these online

17:33.000 --> 17:37.880
streaming companies a competitor of on live if you will and clearly plans to launch their

17:37.880 --> 17:39.440
own service.

17:39.440 --> 17:45.440
So an internal memo was leaked to the Internet where Evil G told their employees essentially

17:45.440 --> 17:51.800
to go open all of the boxes of Deus Ex on the PC take out the code and throw them away.

17:51.800 --> 17:52.880
And that's that.

17:52.880 --> 17:57.200
And so obviously a lot of people not happy to know that the employees opened the product

17:57.200 --> 18:01.040
and took something out of it and then sold it as new and then sold it as new.

18:01.040 --> 18:07.280
Which is funny to me because this isn't a new policy at the G. This is not something

18:07.280 --> 18:08.280
new for them.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.860
We've heard for years on the Internet and so forth about how they open games let employees

18:12.860 --> 18:17.200
rent them and take them home and then bring them back to the store and sell them as a

18:17.200 --> 18:18.200
new game.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.380
Sometimes they reshrink them.

18:19.380 --> 18:24.440
This is nothing new but I guess for whatever reason this is what has pushed people over

18:24.440 --> 18:29.520
the edge and I think what it is is that now it's really something of value came out of

18:29.520 --> 18:30.520
the box.

18:30.520 --> 18:35.960
You know that coupon for all practical purposes was a fifty dollar value although let's be

18:35.960 --> 18:41.720
real I'm sure you can't cross save the on live servers don't talk to the PC yet.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.340
So this on live thing and you're playing your normal version on the PC anyway.

18:45.340 --> 18:50.420
This on live thing is really just a oh neat I have it I play it for five minutes and then

18:50.420 --> 18:51.920
need I saw it I'm done.

18:51.920 --> 18:56.880
Like I bet very very very very few people are truly using that coupon.

18:56.880 --> 19:01.100
But because that coupon you feel like it's a fifty dollar value now evil G has ripped

19:01.100 --> 19:03.200
that out of your hands and you're pissed.

19:03.200 --> 19:07.240
And now there's an issue with the policy that they've been doing for years.

19:07.240 --> 19:12.680
And so this all came to light and it's been really really bad for them.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.260
Here's the surprising thing.

19:14.260 --> 19:18.420
I'm slightly sympathetic towards GameStop.

19:18.420 --> 19:23.560
I actually think it was kind of screwed up of Squeenix to include a competitor's coupon

19:23.560 --> 19:27.120
and not tell evil G what they were doing.

19:27.120 --> 19:31.640
The appropriate response is what GameStop did at the end of the day.

19:31.640 --> 19:35.520
Finally the next day or maybe very late that day they said you know what we're taking this

19:35.520 --> 19:39.680
game off our shelves altogether and we're sending the boxes back to Square Enix.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.720
That's what should have been done in the first place.

19:41.720 --> 19:45.440
If it had been done in the first place none of this would have ever happened.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.760
They wouldn't have had the bad rap.

19:46.760 --> 19:51.320
I mean sure there'd be people to go oh GameStop won't sell Deus Ex on the PC too good huh

19:51.320 --> 19:57.300
but it's not like it's unheard of that a store doesn't sell a certain product right.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.800
Like most RadioShacks don't sell video games.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.920
If you go in there and ask for a copy of a new game on the PC and they say we don't have

20:02.920 --> 20:03.920
it.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.360
Well what the fuck you don't have it right.

20:05.360 --> 20:08.840
You just oh OK I guess I'll go next door to Target or whatever right.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.320
But what it did is it just brought this whole thing to light up.

20:11.320 --> 20:15.840
You mean they're opening new things and then reselling them as new like who the fuck does

20:15.840 --> 20:16.840
that.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.840
Best Buy doesn't do that.

20:17.840 --> 20:18.840
Target doesn't do that.

20:18.840 --> 20:19.840
Walmart doesn't.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.280
Because if you think about it like let's just take it to the extreme here what if they were

20:22.280 --> 20:28.960
say there is some bonus download content that came with a game like say Gears of War something

20:28.960 --> 20:32.640
like that comes with like a map pack or something like that and they say hey you know what we're

20:32.640 --> 20:35.480
going to break open all the copies of Gears of War we're going to take it out and we're

20:35.480 --> 20:38.480
going to sell that map pack separately and then we're also going to sell the game as

20:38.480 --> 20:40.000
new.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.680
So it's brought this policy of theirs to light and part of me of course is doing the Nelson

20:44.680 --> 20:48.640
laugh pointing and going you know I've been telling you guys for a while this is part

20:48.640 --> 20:53.760
of their crap policies and so forth but you know whatever I'm sure people will forget

20:53.760 --> 20:56.960
about this in a couple weeks and continue to buy their games from there.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.340
But it was interesting to kind of see that all come to light and I think the appropriate

21:00.340 --> 21:02.660
response was what happened at the end of the day.

21:02.660 --> 21:07.240
But unfortunately GameStop is too comfortable with let's open new things and then resell

21:07.240 --> 21:10.480
them as new and finally the public was like wait a minute you can't do that.

21:10.480 --> 21:17.460
When I go to Fry's and that's been done there's an open box that's cheaper that I buy because

21:17.460 --> 21:19.460
the box has been opened.

21:19.460 --> 21:20.460
That's the way it works right.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.120
They thought that no one would know.

21:22.120 --> 21:26.040
They thought that no one's going to know that they did this and then on top of that they

21:26.040 --> 21:30.840
also thought hey you know what well and this is actually what they did because they they

21:30.840 --> 21:36.680
made Square Enix apologize to them and they're like oh yeah we're OK with them taking that

21:36.680 --> 21:37.680
stuff back.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.680
Yeah you know why?

21:38.680 --> 21:39.680
Because they're GameStop.

21:39.680 --> 21:44.280
GameStop says oh no fucking you didn't we're not going to sell your fucking games anymore

21:44.280 --> 21:48.200
and they're like oh wait a second we'll go ahead and take those games back we're sorry

21:48.200 --> 21:50.140
we shouldn't have ever done that.

21:50.140 --> 21:53.980
And we as the consumer have given GameStop that monopoly.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.980
Oh yeah.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.160
And if you want that shit to stop you need to take it away.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.600
You need to take that monopoly away.

21:59.600 --> 22:00.600
There is nothing.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.600
I'm not going to hold my breath.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.600
There is nothing.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.800
Why do people go to GameStop in the first place.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.940
Oh because you get a little bit extra download content and stuff like that.

22:07.940 --> 22:08.940
Think about it.

22:08.940 --> 22:10.500
Do you really care if you get an extra skin.

22:10.500 --> 22:14.280
Oh if your hat is orange now instead of green or something like that.

22:14.280 --> 22:19.400
I mean just they're not the only company out there that sells games.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.940
They're not even the best company out there that sells games.

22:21.940 --> 22:29.360
I mean they're just it's just something you know a product you can go to a bunch of other

22:29.360 --> 22:33.600
stores and buy that product and guess what those stores didn't take out the coupons for

22:33.600 --> 22:35.600
on live.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.320
It's because they feel that they have this new service.

22:38.320 --> 22:42.240
Well can you wait and see what's going to happen when that new streaming service comes

22:42.240 --> 22:44.160
around.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.640
That's going to be fun.

22:46.640 --> 22:51.320
I think that it might have been on a Bobby Black Wolf show last week or the week before

22:51.320 --> 22:58.720
someone had called in and said that they had worked at a indie game retail shop and that

22:58.720 --> 23:03.200
they offered much better trade in credit for used games and GameStop did but they could

23:03.200 --> 23:09.320
not get people to shop there because oh if I get the game at GameStop and my green dude

23:09.320 --> 23:12.800
will get a costume code for a slightly lighter shade of green.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.200
And people eat that shit up.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.120
They do eat that shit up and it's sad.

23:16.120 --> 23:20.000
It's sad because that's what they're such a big company now that they can make those

23:20.000 --> 23:25.120
deals and those deals ensure more people come to those stores and it screws everybody else

23:25.120 --> 23:30.680
out and even sometimes they'll be like yeah we want to have the exclusive on that special

23:30.680 --> 23:35.560
edition or whatever or they'll put out some other thing and it's all funded by the publishers

23:35.560 --> 23:39.800
because the publishers will do whatever the fuck they want because they're the majority.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.200
If they don't have the GameStop business they go under.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.800
Yeah if your game's not a GameStop that's a huge coverage of distribution that you've

23:46.800 --> 23:47.800
lost.

23:47.800 --> 23:52.080
I have a comment in our chat room at chat.ornislandry.com Cajudo in chat says in GameStop's defense

23:52.080 --> 23:55.420
Square Enix and OnLive were in the wrong on the coupon side.

23:55.420 --> 23:56.760
Both parties were not in the right.

23:56.760 --> 24:00.480
I actually agree with that and I do think Square Enix needed to apologize to GameStop

24:00.480 --> 24:03.480
because that wasn't cool to include a competitor's coupon.

24:03.480 --> 24:07.160
This is truly a case of though two wrongs don't make a right because who got hurt in

24:07.160 --> 24:08.160
the end?

24:08.160 --> 24:09.160
Did Square Enix get hurt?

24:09.160 --> 24:10.280
Did GameStop get hurt?

24:10.280 --> 24:11.280
No.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.280
The buyers got hurt.

24:12.280 --> 24:16.400
I don't really feel so bad for GameStop because their service is not live.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.520
It's not done yet.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.520
It's not even launched.

24:18.520 --> 24:19.640
It's not even in a beta yet.

24:19.640 --> 24:24.040
I don't feel bad for GameStop because they've been opening shit for years and reselling

24:24.040 --> 24:25.040
it as new.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.920
I understand that but I'm saying there's no reason they should have had to apologize to

24:27.920 --> 24:32.080
them in the first place because it's like saying oh I'm gonna sell this at Walmart.

24:32.080 --> 24:35.340
Walmart's like oh well we're gonna take the code out because we're gonna come out with

24:35.340 --> 24:37.200
our own streaming service five years from now.

24:37.200 --> 24:41.920
Oh well I'm sorry I didn't confirm with you to see if you have a streaming service coming.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.680
I mean big fucking deal yeah you bought a company and you say it's coming out in the

24:45.680 --> 24:49.120
spring of 2012 but is it really gonna come out then?

24:49.120 --> 24:54.840
I mean this thing could be delayed till 2013 and really what?

24:54.840 --> 24:59.880
First off, not that many people buy PC games in the first place and second off, not everybody's

24:59.880 --> 25:06.860
gonna be using that coupon for the free game on OnLive so I just don't know.

25:06.860 --> 25:11.000
If you're worried that your service is gonna be that much threatened by OnLive then you

25:11.000 --> 25:16.880
better figure out some way to save yourselves because OnLive sure got a jump on you.

25:16.880 --> 25:19.200
Alright I don't, go ahead.

25:19.200 --> 25:24.120
They never, they didn't do this with Portal 2 which came with the Steam integration code.

25:24.120 --> 25:29.440
But they don't have, well and actually that does make sense because it's, they're streaming,

25:29.440 --> 25:30.440
they're talking about streaming.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.720
See if there was some sort of streaming copy but that's, but they also have their digital

25:33.720 --> 25:37.200
store that they do sell stuff in.

25:37.200 --> 25:42.400
Anyhow all I gotta say is that as long as the consumer continues to give GameStop the

25:42.400 --> 25:45.720
monopoly this shit's gonna happen but GameStop's scared because they're looking five years

25:45.720 --> 25:49.760
ahead and I think they are a little worried and I think they should be to some extent.

25:49.760 --> 25:54.160
You know stories like this aren't helping it's just pushing digital distribution up

25:54.160 --> 25:58.440
faster and the life cycle of the GameStop store.

25:58.440 --> 26:04.480
Think of it guys, GameStop is going to go the way of Blockbuster in five to ten years.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.480
Think about it.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.280
Digital distribution is never gonna, it doesn't matter.

26:08.280 --> 26:11.720
Just because it's just another segment of the business that's not gonna take over the

26:11.720 --> 26:12.720
business.

26:12.720 --> 26:16.640
And the reason why is because people like physical copies of things.

26:16.640 --> 26:21.040
Some things though people can get away with getting digitally like certain games they,

26:21.040 --> 26:22.520
I don't care about that.

26:22.520 --> 26:27.240
And actually it's kind of the publishers fault a little bit because nowadays hell they're

26:27.240 --> 26:30.960
not even throwing manuals in there it's just a case with a disk in it and that's it.

26:30.960 --> 26:35.400
Alright I wanna get to this week's news but let me do a couple more comments from our

26:35.400 --> 26:36.400
chat room.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.200
After all it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

26:38.200 --> 26:42.920
SonicM88 in our chat at chat.orangelandtrader.com says I also have a good friend who works at

26:42.920 --> 26:45.200
GameStop so I'm a little partial.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.800
And that's in response to something you said earlier.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.840
I go to GameStop for the knowledge.

26:48.840 --> 26:53.200
Their employees always know the most about gaming.

26:53.200 --> 26:58.760
And so yeah you know I think every store is different in that capacity it just kind of

26:58.760 --> 27:02.900
depends and there are I mean like I said at the top my always my beef is GameStop has

27:02.900 --> 27:04.920
never been the front line employees.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.400
It's like any other business.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.440
Some of them are jerks and I don't want to shop at those stores but there are some really

27:09.440 --> 27:13.040
decent people who work at GameStop and that are very knowledgeable about games.

27:13.040 --> 27:18.840
However the bonehead mistakes of management such as what occurred here is just gonna hurt

27:18.840 --> 27:21.040
all those people and it's unfortunate.

27:21.040 --> 27:25.340
And I understand that it's good to have knowledgeable staff at your stores but at the same time

27:25.340 --> 27:27.880
the consumer needs to educate themselves on games.

27:27.880 --> 27:31.520
I mean you don't go blindly into obviously if you're going into a game store you kind

27:31.520 --> 27:33.040
of have an idea of what you want.

27:33.040 --> 27:37.840
I mean and we're talking in a day and age where there's the Internet.

27:37.840 --> 27:43.440
I mean if you want to educate yourself on any about people who come into game stores.

27:43.440 --> 27:46.360
Does Dan want a mic?

27:46.360 --> 27:49.440
People who come into game stores ninety percent of time don't know a dick about what they

27:49.440 --> 27:50.440
want.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.440
OK.

27:51.440 --> 27:52.440
Nothing.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.120
You know what you want when you go into a game store.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.200
But that's because you're an ultra gamer.

27:56.200 --> 28:01.780
Most people come in they're just like oh and they come to you and they're like tell me

28:01.780 --> 28:03.400
what's good.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.560
That's why there's a GameStop.

28:05.560 --> 28:10.400
That's why GameStop even exists because you can't get that at Best Buy because ninety

28:10.400 --> 28:13.880
six percent of people who work at Best Buy don't work in the game section and the two

28:13.880 --> 28:17.560
that do are never fucking there.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.840
The reason GameStop exists it's not that they sell the most games and again it's not like

28:20.840 --> 28:23.000
they sell them the best.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.640
It's just that they're the one store left in the fucking world that you walk into and

28:28.640 --> 28:38.480
it's just all games all the time and if it's any store with a staff that's worth a fuck

28:38.480 --> 28:42.680
everyone there knows about all the games.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.680
Bring it back.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.680
Bring it back motherfucker.

28:44.680 --> 28:45.680
Do it!

28:45.680 --> 28:48.920
Well then those type of people anyway should be shopping at Walmart anyways because they're

28:48.920 --> 28:55.200
you know brainless drones that will just stumble right in to buy any game that you say is good.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.200
Well right but exactly.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.200
Yes!

28:57.200 --> 28:59.600
They're not going to do the difference and all you have to do is educate yourself.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.880
Hey well these people are stupid they're just going to buy whatever you tell them to and

29:02.880 --> 29:04.160
they're like okay.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.880
That's why GameStop exists.

29:05.880 --> 29:09.120
That's why GameStop makes money and that's why GameStop is important because they've

29:09.120 --> 29:11.500
got tremendous pull in the industry.

29:11.500 --> 29:16.140
The people who go to Walmart are either just pointing and shooting and hoping for a good

29:16.140 --> 29:22.360
game or it's someone like you who goes I ain't going to GameStop I'll just stop by Walmart

29:22.360 --> 29:27.280
or Target and hope they have it on the shelf and just bag it.

29:27.280 --> 29:33.480
But for the unwashed masses that's why you hope that you go to a specialty retailer with

29:33.480 --> 29:37.200
a crew that knows about games.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.920
And there's plenty of other specialty retailers out there.

29:39.920 --> 29:40.920
Plan trade.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.560
No no no no no.

29:42.560 --> 29:43.560
Lots of indies.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.640
Right right sure there's a couple.

29:45.640 --> 29:46.640
Look at Sacramento.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.500
How many plan trades do we have?

29:49.500 --> 29:50.760
Do we even still have one?

29:50.760 --> 29:51.760
Folsom's gone right?

29:51.760 --> 29:52.760
Yeah Folsom's gone.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.040
Okay and how many indies do we have?

29:55.040 --> 29:56.040
Three?

29:56.040 --> 29:57.560
A few.

29:57.560 --> 30:01.940
You know there aren't many left and I think that's terrible because I loved independent

30:01.940 --> 30:02.940
game stores.

30:02.940 --> 30:03.940
Oh yeah.

30:03.940 --> 30:06.320
That's the reason I ended up working at GameStop because I was going to use Funco Land at the

30:06.320 --> 30:09.280
moment to teach myself to run an independent game store.

30:09.280 --> 30:14.520
But the problem is is that you know the Akira wave hit and they just engulfed all the other

30:14.520 --> 30:20.640
retailers and what killed GameStop was when they was when they got EB.

30:20.640 --> 30:26.040
Because when they got EB there was no incentive to be a better company because they were the

30:26.040 --> 30:27.280
fucking company.

30:27.280 --> 30:32.560
And now they're only competing on an area where they're so concerned about oh the intangible

30:32.560 --> 30:34.940
competition of this coupon.

30:34.940 --> 30:40.440
Right OnLive was really really competing with GameStop's non-existent streaming service.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.440
Good job guys.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.920
Way to embrace the added value.

30:42.920 --> 30:46.320
I'm sure all two dozen people who keep OnLive because of that coupon are going to never

30:46.320 --> 30:48.440
go to GameStop again right?

30:48.440 --> 30:49.440
Dipshits.

30:49.440 --> 30:54.640
Of course let's also remember that like seven GameStops still sell any amount of PC games

30:54.640 --> 30:55.640
anyway.

30:55.640 --> 30:56.640
Fuck.

30:56.640 --> 30:57.640
I'm done.

30:57.640 --> 31:01.640
All right Dan's rant from the front lines.

31:01.640 --> 31:04.000
He's been there in the front.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.560
And I do think we need to also fairly you know in the chats there's some chatter in

31:08.560 --> 31:12.140
our chat room fairly slap Square Enix on the wrist here too.

31:12.140 --> 31:14.440
They are not without fault in this whole story.

31:14.440 --> 31:18.360
Seriously Final Fantasy 14 what's going on?

31:18.360 --> 31:21.760
It's really Final Fantasy 14's fault when all said and done but no seriously I mean

31:21.760 --> 31:22.760
they do have a responsibility.

31:22.760 --> 31:28.280
It was not cool of them to two days before springing on everybody including the retailers.

31:28.280 --> 31:31.400
Oh by the way we're pushing OnLive in this.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.600
You know that wasn't cool.

31:33.600 --> 31:39.120
Uh you know I think it's cooler than you know say THQ going oh by the way we have this thing

31:39.120 --> 31:42.480
where you have to buy the game new otherwise you got to pay ten dollars to play online

31:42.480 --> 31:47.720
ha ha ha ha suckas.

31:47.720 --> 31:51.680
By the way you need to be connected online all the time to play our game Ubisoft.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.560
I agree and I agree all around.

31:53.560 --> 31:56.680
I think we've given those companies fair razzings where they need to go.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.240
I just want to say this on GameStop and then I swear we'll move into our gaming weeks and

32:00.240 --> 32:01.240
so forth.

32:01.240 --> 32:04.120
It's just like you know I still think the problem at the end of the day although I think

32:04.120 --> 32:08.920
Dan does make a very good point that they're one of the few places left that's all about

32:08.920 --> 32:13.080
the games and the completely clueless can at least kind of have an idea of a place where

32:13.080 --> 32:14.080
to go.

32:14.080 --> 32:17.540
I think even people like that when they hear about this in the mainstream media and it

32:17.540 --> 32:23.180
was on CNN it was on CBS news dot com this was picked up by the mainstream media and

32:23.180 --> 32:27.040
it's funny we have a story later tonight that's going to get into the lols about the local

32:27.040 --> 32:29.840
news and how they can skew stories and so forth.

32:29.840 --> 32:35.160
I think when they do this stuff and communicated to the masses the masses like oh GameStop's

32:35.160 --> 32:37.800
ripping people off well I'm not going to go there anymore.

32:37.800 --> 32:43.440
You know these people that are completely clueless about their games are also pretty

32:43.440 --> 32:47.960
fickle and I think when they find out that there are other options available to them

32:47.960 --> 32:53.840
you know this is this is a great opportunity for companies like Best Buy.

32:53.840 --> 32:57.320
I think Target I'm trying to think of who's been trying to strengthen their gaming lately

32:57.320 --> 33:01.720
I know we've heard the reports about the Best Buy's doing something and I think I want to

33:01.720 --> 33:05.880
say there was a Target initiative too because they were doing buybacks to games and so forth.

33:05.880 --> 33:08.800
In the end of the day this is going to work out really well for them.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.440
It's about seizing this opportunity I think.

33:11.440 --> 33:17.400
So anyhow I think Amazon don't they have new gaming stuff but Amazon's weird because they're

33:17.400 --> 33:21.840
such a huge company but we never see them like they're just out and on the internet.

33:21.840 --> 33:26.780
Well and I think if you listen to what Dana just said about people needing advice on like

33:26.780 --> 33:30.960
what freaking games to buy I think that kind of answers the question as to why Amazon will

33:30.960 --> 33:33.880
never be the only store.

33:33.880 --> 33:37.520
It will always be an option for the people that know what they want for the people that

33:37.520 --> 33:39.480
don't know what they want Amazon doesn't work.

33:39.480 --> 33:43.720
And granted for the people that I would say listen to our show I mean I would hope that

33:43.720 --> 33:48.600
a lot of them that are pretty knowledgeable of games that are coming out but if you're

33:48.600 --> 33:53.320
not I mean there's message boards out there you know hey you know I'm interested in blah

33:53.320 --> 34:01.640
blah blah blah blah you know what games would you recommend that I play.

34:01.640 --> 34:06.400
Dan's yelling from the living room but we can't hear him so all right let's move on.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.440
We talked like for a half hour about GameStop and that whole story last week I want to move

34:09.440 --> 34:10.440
on.

34:10.440 --> 34:14.480
Let's move on into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you have been playing.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.480
Loki we'll start with you tonight.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.480
So Star Stalker is not here.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.060
How was your gaming week?

34:18.060 --> 34:19.060
It was all right.

34:19.060 --> 34:20.720
I still haven't been playing a whole lot of stuff.

34:20.720 --> 34:29.800
I played a little bit more of VVVV and I have all the shiny objects except for one and it's

34:29.800 --> 34:33.140
the probably one of the hardest ones to get.

34:33.140 --> 34:43.320
It's four screens of dodging spikes and then you hit the top reverse and dodge four more

34:43.320 --> 34:48.520
screens of spikes it makes you want to pull your hair out and I just said you know what

34:48.520 --> 34:52.480
fuck it I know what I get for getting this I get the whole game upside down and I don't

34:52.480 --> 34:58.320
give a fuck about playing this game again so that's it I'm done with that game and then

34:58.320 --> 35:02.160
it's still a great game though it was a great game yes but and I understand it's supposed

35:02.160 --> 35:07.240
to be really hard but it's just like I don't care I don't care it's like they're like ha

35:07.240 --> 35:14.000
you have to go through four screens jump over this one little like ledge that yes I get

35:14.000 --> 35:17.840
it my character can't jump but he can reverse gravity you think if you have the technology

35:17.840 --> 35:22.560
to reverse gravity you can I don't know step over something but of course you know whatever

35:22.560 --> 35:28.200
rules of the game so okay um but yeah I'm just not playing anymore because I don't care

35:28.200 --> 35:35.680
to get to some secret laboratory or whatever that's got you know some bonus stuff I don't

35:35.680 --> 35:42.440
care about whatever um played more Earth Defense Force inside Garmageddon I have my first character

35:42.440 --> 35:49.440
leveled up to tier eight my tactical guy and I guess gotta start working on some of my

35:49.440 --> 36:01.120
other characters like my trooper jet and was it battle so very fun game still and hopefully

36:01.120 --> 36:04.920
gonna be playing a little bit more co-op on that because I haven't gotten a chance to

36:04.920 --> 36:11.880
lately been playing lots of Grand Theft Auto still still fun still trying to win as many

36:11.880 --> 36:16.680
games as possible so I can get my ranks up because I not playing for about six months

36:16.680 --> 36:23.280
drop me about 30 30 ranks in the rank death match so that kind of pissed me off a little

36:23.280 --> 36:30.720
bit but nothing really I could do there just a lot of people not necessarily beating me

36:30.720 --> 36:36.620
but played less game so if they you know have a streak of 10 or whatever counts a lot more

36:36.620 --> 36:42.840
than what I get I have to I'd have like a streak of 30 and if I lose one it's just going

36:42.840 --> 36:49.360
back just as far so it sucks cuz I played so many games and then what else did I play

36:49.360 --> 36:59.960
not much download my 3ds NES games so have those on my 3ds now so played them though

36:59.960 --> 37:14.440
trying to play something else on the iPod now that's pretty much it all right so pop

37:14.440 --> 37:22.320
how was your gaming week mostly World of Warcraft a lot of World of Warcraft at the Flint's

37:22.320 --> 37:29.320
arcade at Disneyland I got to play our type in an actual stand-up machine just as hard

37:29.320 --> 37:34.640
as it is on the Super NES and every other incarnation of our type that's ever existed

37:34.640 --> 37:41.800
also the classic I think this even this may even predate Street Fighter 1 by Capcom which

37:41.800 --> 37:47.000
was an awful game but Konami's I think it's kung-fu master if anyone remembers that game

37:47.000 --> 37:50.520
you're the little guy in the little white g with the black belt does you mean you are

37:50.520 --> 37:55.040
kung-fu or something like that isn't yeah it's a tsunami fighter and these you are kung-fu

37:55.040 --> 38:01.960
and like the big like yeah and I think the very first villain or combatant is like this

38:01.960 --> 38:06.480
big chunky dude bald-headed that that game I'm I used to play the hell out of that game

38:06.480 --> 38:10.700
at the pizza parlor when I was in junior high because you know we all played video games

38:10.700 --> 38:15.480
at pizza parlors back then so yeah those two games were what I focused on it at Flint's

38:15.480 --> 38:21.040
arcade there wasn't a lot there that really you know struck stuck out to me if they had

38:21.040 --> 38:28.080
they had gauntlet and a bunch of other stuff but I've been checking out the games on Google

38:28.080 --> 38:32.520
Plus because they just got their gaming API added and I've been playing believe it or

38:32.520 --> 38:37.520
not a game I've had a lot of disdain for the Apple Store playing it on the iPad going I

38:37.520 --> 38:42.160
don't get this why is everyone losing their mind over this game angry birds I'm playing

38:42.160 --> 38:46.760
it right now actually on Dark Sakura's machine why oh that's very appropriate for not being

38:46.760 --> 38:51.760
here why why angry birds I don't understand the allure of this game why why is does America

38:51.760 --> 38:56.880
have and I'm assuming the rest the world to this sick fascination with angry birds it's

38:56.880 --> 39:02.780
boring I don't know I I I am with you I played it it was alright it's kind of neat you know

39:02.780 --> 39:09.440
yeah it's a physic puzzler and you launch birds in the things you need I but I don't

39:09.440 --> 39:14.280
I'm not obsessed about it I like it was like it was alright you know it's cheap iPod game

39:14.280 --> 39:19.320
as far as these iPod games go I like cut the rope but I wouldn't buy the guy on a t-shirt

39:19.320 --> 39:23.140
and I've literally like while I was at Disneyland I saw like a ton of angry birds t-shirts they're

39:23.140 --> 39:30.160
making a fucking movie based on this why why oh I know why because Hollywood's really run

39:30.160 --> 39:36.080
out of ideas I mean it's like let's make a game I don't know if it's in our show role

39:36.080 --> 39:43.000
but we've able is making a movie based on some like a doom clone no I didn't make our

39:43.000 --> 39:46.760
show role because I saw it label and I was like it's like some doom clone it's like you

39:46.760 --> 39:53.480
would never know it you know I didn't realize this obscure game is it's basically excuse

39:53.480 --> 39:58.280
for him to make a zombie movie he's like okay what games a zombie thing okay I'm gonna base

39:58.280 --> 40:04.420
my movie on this all right but we're we're we're digressing so slices pop you're playing

40:04.420 --> 40:12.600
angry birds right now justify yourself look at your life look at your choice I know it's

40:12.600 --> 40:17.360
it really takes just no brainpower to play this game you have unlimited retries you just

40:17.360 --> 40:23.640
fling birds at shit until you kill all the pigs that's the whole game I know I have no

40:23.640 --> 40:28.160
room to talk and there's a game I've been playing this didn't hit the pig when I aimed

40:28.160 --> 40:33.600
it high so let's name it no and try it again no I did it and then like you're you know

40:33.600 --> 40:36.880
it's now 3 in the morning and your iPhone is out of battery life I don't know I don't

40:36.880 --> 40:42.560
get it but yeah I'm that and also I need to look up the name of it there for those

40:42.560 --> 40:50.120
listening who enjoy bust a move or puzzle bobble it is as it is more appropriately called

40:50.120 --> 40:59.400
there is a clone of that game on Google Plus called a ripoff of worms right there I'm not

40:59.400 --> 41:04.960
sure but at the monkeys in it it was that monster world that character looked hideous

41:04.960 --> 41:10.760
that was like a that was like a divine but not like a like Charlie the tuna dressed in

41:10.760 --> 41:15.760
drag what was that like a monster world or something like that forget it it's called

41:15.760 --> 41:20.360
for it's called bubble island and there's this little raccoon and he's like it plays

41:20.360 --> 41:24.920
exactly like puzzle bobble bust a move so if you like like those games and have Google

41:24.920 --> 41:29.420
Plus and you want to you can't really spam the shit out of people on Google Plus and

41:29.420 --> 41:33.580
also Facebook has copied that format it all goes to a totally separate tab if you want

41:33.580 --> 41:37.560
to support indie art or indie developers all they can do is make fucking clones of really

41:37.560 --> 41:42.500
awesome games just you know the cash in then go right ahead is that iPhone developer game

41:42.500 --> 41:46.400
loft or whatever they they thrive on ripping games off and they do it really well yeah

41:46.400 --> 41:50.500
but that's that's the thing they do it really well I mean and to the point they fucking

41:50.500 --> 41:56.880
got wow on an iPhone it's pretty pretty amazing I gotta say it's sad it's like you know it

41:56.880 --> 42:02.160
would be like having Spielberg doing remakes of something we have we have some Angry Birds

42:02.160 --> 42:07.000
defenders in our chat room at chat.com and every gamer does get a voice here act-def

42:07.000 --> 42:11.640
says Angry Birds is fun not the best game ever Izzam says Angry Birds is just something

42:11.640 --> 42:15.640
you can let your mind go numb on and waste time with Kaijuto says Angry Birds is the

42:15.640 --> 42:20.840
best we all love to knock down stuff act-def says Angry Birds is fun because of the cute

42:20.840 --> 42:24.840
destruction it happens in the game it's also like a puzzler so people like to knock things

42:24.840 --> 42:31.080
over yeah I guess that's the allure of Jenga I don't know all right so Angry Birds fine

42:31.080 --> 42:37.520
anything else Angry Birds wow the two games at Flynn's arcade and that oh um I play your

42:37.520 --> 42:45.000
3ds when you're at work and I'm bored so what games on 3ds uh Metroid Ice Climbers uh Zelda

42:45.000 --> 42:48.260
2 oh the ambassador games yeah the master were you kind of doing that thing where you'd

42:48.260 --> 42:51.560
play them for five minutes and you go yep it's Zelda and then switch to another game

42:51.560 --> 43:00.760
yeah do you feel yourself needing to yell at Zelda 2 so why is this game so damn annoying

43:00.760 --> 43:05.360
and games like that were easier when I was nine I don't know look look look there it

43:05.360 --> 43:10.120
is like that it's not did you see that character like what the hell was that was that called

43:10.120 --> 43:16.320
Monster Island it was like Charlie the Tuna in drag all right um all right so I guess

43:16.320 --> 43:20.280
that's it for your yeah see wild ones that is a fucking ripoff right yeah that looks

43:20.280 --> 43:26.000
like a worm it's a panda bear with a gun how could that game not be good all right moving

43:26.000 --> 43:30.040
on I want to talk about my gaming week of which actually since you know I was out of

43:30.040 --> 43:34.120
town I don't have a whole lot to talk about Flynn's arcade I played Frogger I don't know

43:34.120 --> 43:38.880
why much much to Loki's dismay I love to play old school Frogger in an actual don't get

43:38.880 --> 43:42.880
me wrong old school Frogger is cool I just don't see the need of the constant remakes

43:42.880 --> 43:46.440
of Frogger I'm with you there because they weren't good and I played Donkey Kong Junior

43:46.440 --> 43:49.800
like I've just been I don't know like I wanted to play that in the arcade hella bad and then

43:49.800 --> 43:53.160
finally you could download that on your I know ironically enough that ended up being

43:53.160 --> 43:57.480
one of the 3ds ambassador games and I played it there too and one of my whole like fun

43:57.480 --> 44:01.280
it but it's funny I played it not even a day after I played the arcade version and I could

44:01.280 --> 44:04.600
really see the difference like right away not like graphically but just in how the game

44:04.600 --> 44:08.800
was a little easier on the NES than it was in the arcade that's for sure but that's you

44:08.800 --> 44:14.480
can't like if you fall even a little bit from one platform to a platform that's underneath

44:14.480 --> 44:20.680
you you die yeah you can't there's no yeah has to be you can do like a slight fall but

44:20.680 --> 44:24.200
not not because I'm thinking it's like Mario where if it's not a pit where it just goes

44:24.200 --> 44:29.240
off the bottom of the screen you can just jump down there no you're you die no yeah

44:29.240 --> 44:34.000
so been playing some 3ds ambassador games as well played Metroid probably the longest

44:34.000 --> 44:38.520
out of them all actually played Metroid for a little bit so that was kind of fun I do

44:38.520 --> 44:43.240
loves me some Metroid and as far as other real games go I'll tell you what the game

44:43.240 --> 44:48.680
that ate up the most of my time that wasn't wow was Civilization 5 I played an epic multiplayer

44:48.680 --> 44:53.560
Civ 5 match over the weekend it went on for six hours me and two of my friends from the

44:53.560 --> 44:58.600
Bay Area started up a game at 8 o'clock on Friday night and it was like 2 15 in the morning

44:58.600 --> 45:03.960
and we were like oh my god it's like after one we should probably like go to bed so we

45:03.960 --> 45:07.280
need to save the game and I don't even know if we're gonna be able to recover from the

45:07.280 --> 45:12.140
save because like I couldn't save the game only the host could save the game so I really

45:12.140 --> 45:16.640
hope we are able to restore from that save gamer it's gonna be very sad but at the same

45:16.640 --> 45:20.340
time it was a lot of fun and just goes to show how freaking addicting that game was

45:20.340 --> 45:26.160
but it was it was neat like I found that my two friends are very expansionistic whereas

45:26.160 --> 45:31.120
I'm more about get five cities and make them just fucking fortresses and build them up

45:31.120 --> 45:35.120
as best you can it's the year you know 1700 and they have laser beam technology or whatever

45:35.120 --> 45:39.320
yeah actually yeah we had riflemen in the year 1500 we had to end the game around like

45:39.320 --> 45:43.180
1600 of course we were on kind of dumb dumb difficulty because we didn't want the computer

45:43.180 --> 45:49.560
to kick our ass too much so I don't know I just I love Civilization and the Civilization

45:49.560 --> 45:54.840
series and Civ 5 is my favorite since the original so nothing will ever top the original

45:54.840 --> 46:01.000
to me because I'm just stuck up that way but Civ 5 is pretty freaking great and I'm having

46:01.000 --> 46:05.080
a lot of fun playing that online and I want to like do that again any iPhone games you've

46:05.080 --> 46:11.800
been playing um tiny tower which whatever shut up don't don't taunt me I will say this

46:11.800 --> 46:17.640
I've also been I besides Civ 5 and stuff and light light console stuff here and there keep

46:17.640 --> 46:22.140
in mind guys my Xbox is still out of commission remember the hack it's been three weeks I

46:22.140 --> 46:27.320
need to call Xbox tomorrow where's my money if they're even open it's Labor Day I don't

46:27.320 --> 46:32.000
know so I only really have a ps3 and I was gone for most of the weeks that's why my gaming

46:32.000 --> 46:37.240
week was a little bit sad but I will say this on Facebook speaking of sad I've got sucked

46:37.240 --> 46:43.800
into sim social hanging my head in shame allowing I'm shaking my head in shame I know smh smh

46:43.800 --> 46:50.640
it's just it's I will say this it's a pretty darn good ripoff of the sims and you know

46:50.640 --> 46:55.120
I think everybody got addicted to the sims at some point not like there's definitely

46:55.120 --> 46:59.480
varying levels of difficulty but okay why are you giving a big thumbs down slash spot

46:59.480 --> 47:05.240
it was like a year maybe even two years after the sims one which came out what 2000 2001

47:05.240 --> 47:10.880
came out it it had beaten mist as like the top selling pc game ever I played it for a

47:10.880 --> 47:15.920
weekend I did not get it I thought it was so boring and I have not looked at the sims

47:15.920 --> 47:21.320
franchise since and that was 10 years ago wow no I just I don't think people get sucked

47:21.320 --> 47:27.520
into it like Jamie level Jamie plays a lot of sims but you know I played the first one

47:27.520 --> 47:30.580
for a couple weeks and thought it was a lot of fun and you know kind of got sucked into

47:30.580 --> 47:35.160
it and the lives of my little sims and now they have it on Facebook and of course here's

47:35.160 --> 47:41.360
the thing I think they've done a good job of translating the sims into a Facebook game

47:41.360 --> 47:44.880
even though the whole energy thing is very limiting but what can you do the game's free

47:44.880 --> 47:48.980
you know there's got to be some limits but here's the thing I think sim social is also

47:48.980 --> 47:54.560
like everything you fucking hate about a Facebook game is in this game like the spam on people's

47:54.560 --> 48:00.540
walls and ask all your friends for a cookie or whatever and all this stuff like it's just

48:00.540 --> 48:06.320
bullshit like how much this game fucks up your Facebook wall and this is why people

48:06.320 --> 48:12.360
hate Facebook games like I really want sim social to be on Google Plus because I don't

48:12.360 --> 48:16.480
think it will be because it can't be as invasive on Google Plus you're grinning over there

48:16.480 --> 48:21.760
salacious pop yeah I have I have not added sim social to my Facebook in any way so it's

48:21.760 --> 48:26.180
I don't technically have it installed or whatever it's called but if I go to my games tab on

48:26.180 --> 48:30.680
Facebook there's at least 10 people that I know very well in real life that are like

48:30.680 --> 48:35.000
join sim social and send me a little fluffy pillow because I'm trying to renovate my living

48:35.000 --> 48:39.200
room and I need it for my couch send me a pillow and I just want to say like no I'll

48:39.200 --> 48:44.680
send you fire to burn down your goddamn house stop bothering me they actually do have fury

48:44.680 --> 48:51.640
anyway but yeah this is why people hate Facebook games it is the fastest growing game since

48:51.640 --> 48:56.560
Farmville though it's the biggest it's going to be the biggest Facebook game since Farmville

48:56.560 --> 49:00.560
I guarantee you don't you have to like mow your lawn to earn points yeah you can crop

49:00.560 --> 49:03.320
all the grass and you have to you have to do that like if you don't want to actually

49:03.320 --> 49:06.800
take care of your real lawn in real life you can mow your digital lawn well it's just like

49:06.800 --> 49:12.200
okay not to get too tangeny too late but we went to go visit my mother this week because

49:12.200 --> 49:15.440
it was my dad's birthday and you know my mother's a very animated character and she was talking

49:15.440 --> 49:18.900
about her friend that plays Farmville right and what was she telling us about her friend

49:18.900 --> 49:22.960
like her friend is afraid to leave the house she was going on vacation and she had to give

49:22.960 --> 49:27.920
her daughter because I think this was a retired aged woman had to give her a 70 year old woman

49:27.920 --> 49:32.080
had to get her 71 had to give her grown daughter her Facebook password so that her daughter

49:32.080 --> 49:36.580
could log in once or twice a day to click on all of the farm to feed her chickens to

49:36.580 --> 49:41.920
feed the chicken or they might die yeah she didn't want her farm to lose the progression

49:41.920 --> 49:48.180
of points when she was on chickens yeah Farmville chickens I mean that's like what these games

49:48.180 --> 49:53.340
have become to some people and if the chickens ever do die she could just take out a credit

49:53.340 --> 49:57.800
card and buy five dollars worth of Zinga bucks and just respawn her chickens that's how they

49:57.800 --> 50:05.060
make money yeah taking advantage of I'm very I'm very proud of my mother for not getting

50:05.060 --> 50:09.140
sucked into all that she does she always she's very staunch I'm not getting on Facebook no

50:09.140 --> 50:14.980
one wants to see my face but I don't know if I should say this on the show but she she

50:14.980 --> 50:22.780
got she's on don't ask do not ask me she's on Twitter she got a Twitter account and she

50:22.780 --> 50:27.440
asked me how to upload her picture to her Twitter account and she's following like Rosie

50:27.440 --> 50:32.920
and and what share and stuff on Twitter and it's really cute but yeah she doesn't want

50:32.920 --> 50:36.600
me I told her I would plug her Twitter and would get her some followers but she doesn't

50:36.600 --> 50:40.100
want it she doesn't she she gets creeped out by people following so don't try to find her

50:40.100 --> 50:44.800
guys she doesn't want to be found so but she's she's on there and it's really really funny

50:44.800 --> 50:50.100
so I'm proud of my mother for finally embracing technology because for the longest time she

50:50.100 --> 50:53.340
was one of those people that thought the CD-ROM drive was a coaster why are you paying two

50:53.340 --> 51:00.140
hundred bucks for the coaster so anyway let's move on then that's it for our gaming weeks

51:00.140 --> 51:04.580

slash orange launch radio we are also on Twitter at twitter.com slash olr you can find us there

51:17.800 --> 51:24.160
on Twitter so I guess that's it let's get into this week's gaming news after plenty

51:24.160 --> 51:27.380
of talk of last week's news and our antics this week let's finally talk about what's

51:27.380 --> 51:34.020
going on this week Loki this weekend was the call of duty XP event in LA it was kind of

51:34.020 --> 51:40.500
their call of duty con if you will where they were talking about the new elite service and

51:40.500 --> 51:47.700
also the hardened edition of modern warfare 3 so the first thing we're going to talk about

51:47.700 --> 51:52.540
real quick is the hardened edition which thankfully this year it is only one special edition no

51:52.540 --> 51:58.700
prestige this time around no RC car that's way overpriced or some cheap ass night vision

51:58.700 --> 52:06.340
goggles that really are just some toys this time you get basically the game plus is a

52:06.340 --> 52:13.580
field guide that it's over a hundred pages some avatar clothes or did you know animated

52:13.580 --> 52:20.700
theme if you're on a PlayStation Network also one year of call of duty elite membership

52:20.700 --> 52:31.100
which is apparently a $50 value and all that's gonna run you 80 bucks and I have to say you

52:31.100 --> 52:39.300
know I did watch the least a part of their streaming coverage of the one they're talking

52:39.300 --> 52:44.620
about the multiplayer and the elite service and I gotta say man they they really have

52:44.620 --> 52:49.980
got their shit together as far as how to do an online community and how to give the fans

52:49.980 --> 52:55.020
what they want for that it's it's kind of interesting because like you know what they're

52:55.020 --> 52:59.980
not going to do too bad without infinity Ward I mean the old infinity Ward there's still

52:59.980 --> 53:04.780
infinity Ward but in the game out but it's not all the old people from infinity Ward

53:04.780 --> 53:08.700
but they got their shit together as far as online community and that's really what's

53:08.700 --> 53:13.180
going to stand them apart from battlefield 3 elaborate a little more like why why is

53:13.180 --> 53:18.140
it so awesome well there's a bunch of stuff to the offer for free and it's all on this

53:18.140 --> 53:24.180
basically you can create clans you can you can it links in with Facebook you can find

53:24.180 --> 53:31.460
your friends on Facebook and build to play games with them you can join up groups that

53:31.460 --> 53:36.660
are necessarily like say for example I'm a fan of the Giants or something like that I

53:36.660 --> 53:40.420
can play with other Call of Duty players that are fans of you know the San Francisco Giants

53:40.420 --> 53:48.180
or whatever so nothing I'm a Giants fan I hate sports but they have that kind of stuff

53:48.180 --> 53:55.060
they have where you can break down you can see what other players loadouts are like say

53:55.060 --> 53:59.620
for example you you know playing against somebody and somebody kills you and you can see you

53:59.620 --> 54:03.380
know you can pull up all this information all the hotspots on the map you can see what

54:03.380 --> 54:07.480
their loadout was you can try their loadout if you want you can create your own game modes

54:07.480 --> 54:11.380
you can upload those share them with friends they can tweak them they can you share them

54:11.380 --> 54:20.300
back again you can capture 30-second clips and post them up in HD to share with friends

54:20.300 --> 54:27.820
you can compete in tournaments you know for real prizes that of course that's the paid

54:27.820 --> 54:32.800
service and they're gonna have different tournaments based on people's skill levels so it's not

54:32.800 --> 54:40.580
gonna be just all you know crazy Call of Duty elite players and stuff like that they also

54:40.580 --> 54:47.540
with the elite service you're gonna be able to get all the download content for for free

54:47.540 --> 54:51.860
and you're gonna be able to get it first so they're gonna put out download content every

54:51.860 --> 54:55.620
month instead of every quarter like they normally do everybody else you know that's not paying

54:55.620 --> 54:59.660
for the elite service or doesn't buy the hardened edition you have to pay for that separately

54:59.660 --> 55:06.580
and that's 60 bucks if you were to buy all that on top of you know the membership or

55:06.580 --> 55:12.020
without the membership I guess so lots of it just is interesting and lots of different

55:12.020 --> 55:17.220
you know game modes and basically just kind of they retweet you know their whole perk

55:17.220 --> 55:22.220
system and stuff like that and it just sounded interesting for someone that I'm not really

55:22.220 --> 55:26.420
into the series at all I mean it's just for me it feels like if I hadn't been playing

55:26.420 --> 55:30.820
the first one and haven't been playing solid like you know like I do with Grand Theft Auto

55:30.820 --> 55:36.420
I'm don't really feel comfortable playing Modern Warfare 3 you know I probably could

55:36.420 --> 55:42.300
it's just you know some of those players play you know Call of Duty like I played Grand

55:42.300 --> 55:45.980
Theft Auto so yeah DDR Dalla Billinor Chatham is with you I'm just not interested in the

55:45.980 --> 55:49.800
Call of Duty series so you know and I'm not really into those games as well but I can

55:49.800 --> 55:55.340
also see I recognize that they're huge games in the industry and that more importantly

55:55.340 --> 56:00.060
where this succeeds other games might follow do you see something like this coming to other

56:00.060 --> 56:05.220
games I hope so I would love this for like Grand Theft Auto it would be awesome there's

56:05.220 --> 56:08.540
not that many people that play Grand Theft Auto multiplayer which I hope changes with

56:08.540 --> 56:15.860
the next one but you know whenever that may be sooner than you think I think next year

56:15.860 --> 56:20.580
for sure but I mean it would be great I would love that kind of stuff and they kind of had

56:20.580 --> 56:24.900
something sort of like that with the whole social club with Rockstar Games and stuff

56:24.900 --> 56:28.860
but it's not really in game it's more of just you go to a website and you can interact all

56:28.860 --> 56:34.160
the stuff whereas this is actually in the game you can do all that before with Black

56:34.160 --> 56:40.100
Ops I guess you could do that on the website but now it's actually in the game and you

56:40.100 --> 56:47.000
can do everything you can on the website which is pretty awesome so yeah I hope I hope they

56:47.000 --> 56:52.420
do that and I mean if it as long as it delivers on what they say because honestly prior to

56:52.420 --> 56:55.980
this information I would have said Battlefield 3 is probably gonna be the better game and

56:55.980 --> 57:02.060
I still think you know they're two different types of games but I mean it looks Battlefield

57:02.060 --> 57:07.940
3 looks really good so if they have you know some decent multiplayer you know community

57:07.940 --> 57:12.540
features and stuff like that it still might be you know a toss-up between the two but

57:12.540 --> 57:17.020
don't you think most people just end up with both probably you know what and there's nothing

57:17.020 --> 57:21.100
wrong with that you don't have to draw you know pick sides or anything I mean this isn't

57:21.100 --> 57:24.760
a competition it's just it's a competition between develop or you know publishers and

57:24.760 --> 57:29.140
developers and stuff but when the players come involved it just whatever buy what you

57:29.140 --> 57:36.380
want I mean this is you don't have to make a choice it's whatever so some other things

57:36.380 --> 57:41.540
they talked about go with the elite stuff real quick mobile apps they're gonna be putting

57:41.540 --> 57:44.980
out some mobile apps so you could check out what your friends are doing and make all those

57:44.980 --> 57:52.020
tweaks and stuff on your iPod or iPhone or your Android or whatever PC so they're gonna

57:52.020 --> 58:02.940
have that as well other fun stuff let's see here's the basically the bonuses that they're

58:02.940 --> 58:07.100
gonna offer customers the first subscribers will get a year's worth of download content

58:07.100 --> 58:11.420
for modern warfare 3 and they're saying it's over 20 pieces of content and they're gonna

58:11.420 --> 58:16.420
be putting out monthly content drops instead of quarterly and they'll include new maps

58:16.420 --> 58:21.560
new game modes with you know the value being 60 bucks elite subscribers will have access

58:21.560 --> 58:26.720
to daily and weekly competitions and events which will offer both real and virtual prizes

58:26.720 --> 58:31.660
subscribers will be able to level up their clans in competition so that's kind of cool

58:31.660 --> 58:38.300
and and also see they'll have eight times more video sharing capacity than standard

58:38.300 --> 58:43.540
users they'll have access to expert strategy and analysis including tips on guns maps perks

58:43.540 --> 58:48.040
whatever that was one of the other things I kind of liked is you can level up your preferences

58:48.040 --> 58:53.540
on different weapons so instead of just leveling up your character if I use like a p90 all

58:53.540 --> 58:59.260
the time I would get skills you know be able to put scopes on it or whatever you know different

58:59.260 --> 59:05.820
modifications which is kind of cool they're gonna have elite TV which is this like premium

59:05.820 --> 59:13.540
service thing it's gonna have different different like shows I guess like Friday night fights

59:13.540 --> 59:18.020
which they're gonna I guess it's being produced by Ridley and Tony Scott and they're gonna

59:18.020 --> 59:22.580
put like different rivals like okay they're this one week is gonna be like Democrats versus

59:22.580 --> 59:25.700
Republicans or something like that and so you can watch the games play out and that

59:25.700 --> 59:31.600
kind of stuff they're gonna have noob tube I guess which is some clips or whatever that

59:31.600 --> 59:38.300
are gonna be kind of they're gonna have people making commentary on them including Will Arnett

59:38.300 --> 59:42.860
and Jason Bateman they're gonna be smack targeting over I guess user created videos from the

59:42.860 --> 59:48.140
game so I mean that's kind of cool and that's definitely unique content I would say but

59:48.140 --> 59:52.800
you know is it for everybody you know is it for like someone that you know like me that's

59:52.800 --> 59:56.620
not really in the call do you serious yeah probably not but it's it's definitely some

59:56.620 --> 59:59.820
stuff to kind of go hey that's kind of you know I'll have to check that out and a lot

59:59.820 --> 01:00:04.180
of this stuff was for free you know you don't have to buy into the subscription there's

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:08.880
a lot of that stuff that's already available for free and if you want that additional stuff

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:13.420
later on you can buy into it I guess or buy the hardened edition you get all that for

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:17.620
free and then finally the announced of course you know with a big game like that they're

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:24.660
gonna be doing an exclusive Xbox 360 bundle it's gonna come with a modern warfare 3 branded

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:32.540
console and couple controllers 320 gigabyte hard drive also custom startup and loading

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:41.060
disk sounds and that'll be I guess they're also gonna say those controllers are also

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:46.260
available separately for 60 bucks and they're gonna be doing a new headset which is also

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:53.260
coming out non-branded modern warfare 3 for 70 bucks that also is a Bluetooth headset

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:59.420
and those are the new Microsoft headsets now be coming out for $3.99 probably around the

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:05.620
same time as this the system. Interesting comment on our chat on chat.org.com ddrdollarbill

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:11.300
says should this shit really be taken that seriously and cyberbeast says to some people

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:15.020
yeah and I'm kind of inclined to agree with cyberbeast because I think I think everybody's

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:20.780
kind of got their thing even in gaming you know like I'm sure some folks paid an insane

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:25.980
amount of money to import those plastic instruments from Japan and the Bomani games that came

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:30.500
with that or a World of Warcraft game comes out in a limited edition that has you know

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:34.660
the uber book and soundtrack and all that stuff and people sign up for that and they

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:39.940
have premium services as well I mean I think either you have your thing or none of it's

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:45.840
really interesting to you you play a variety of games and like I said the $50 a year may

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.300
not be your thing especially if you're already paying for live you know that's already money

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:55.500
out of your pocket but a lot of the services on there are free so I mean check out at least

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:59.700
a free portion of it because why not I mean if you're playing it it sounds like it'd be

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:05.460
a good value but I don't really think a lot of people need expert tips or need to watch

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:11.660
Will Arnett make fun of videos I mean no one really needs that right and the download content

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:15.420
bonus is kind of cool because you're saving some money if you're planning on buying all

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:21.220
the download content I mean they're just trying to make money on the digital end because they're

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:24.620
making a lot of money on the digital side and then once again you know the the only

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:28.860
thing that kind of leaves a sour taste in my mouth would be you know the fact that this

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:38.500
company puts it out as Activision so yeah it's like yeah I really want to support Activision

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:42.800
I will say that you know again I'm not really into the series but I'm looking at the screenshot

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:48.660
of the you know hardened edition that is a lot of crap for a game that's a lot of crap

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:52.260
but I guess if I was really into this series I'd probably buy it I don't know if there's

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:56.460
a limited edition for Skyrim I'm probably gonna get it you know we all have our things

01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:00.940
yeah there is it comes with the map they actually sign me up there's actually is kind of funny

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:07.780
the limited edition for Lord of the Rings war north comes with a an arrow quiver a leather

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:13.300
quiver wow that's awesome also of note it sounds like this Call of Duty Expo thing was

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:17.500
kind of a success for them too oh yeah I think so I definitely will be doing next year so

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.260
very interesting whatever the next game is all right well let's shift gears a little

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:24.140
bit and talk about Nintendo they are doing an event of their own now you know Tokyo doesn't

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:28.740
or excuse me Nintendo does not usually participate in the Tokyo game show hey they don't usually

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.220
go and this that's no new news they're not going this year either but they are going

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:37.660
to be doing a special press conference it's gonna take place on September 13th and that's

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:41.780
two days before the Tokyo game show now some folks are kind of reacting to this with what

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:48.020
could it be this could be a new 3ds maybe because there's always there's that rumor

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.180
going around right now that there's that 3ds is supposed to have a second analog stick

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:58.020
and all that stuff to which I say no no no that can't be true I mean it might be true

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.740
Nintendo's always working on something all the game companies are working on something

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:07.260
you bet you you bet your ass Sony's I station for it even though they're not sure that's

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:10.980
gonna piss off a lot of people and you think you think that price drop pissed off a lot

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:16.460
of people putting out a new system with six months you know with the holidays still to

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:21.460
come I have no doubt Nintendo is working on the next 3ds model for 2012 or 2013 they're

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:25.540
not gonna be okay let me put take it from the like the PSP they're not gonna add another

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:28.900
second analog sick because now you're gonna have games they're only gonna work on the

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:33.740
one system and not the old 3ds well there was talk about at having an add-on that would

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:36.860
plug it I don't know how it would work but it would plug into the existing DS and give

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:41.280
you the extra analog stick it could work it could work I could see how they could do it

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.160
you could plug something into the back of there like what the charger usually goes and

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.820
kind of have it reach what you're grinning that reminds me of the logitech rumor that

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:55.860
they were making a UMD accessory for the PlayStation go it's kind of funny huh it's I'm grinning

01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:59.460
cuz it reminded me that story here's the thing I think people are freaking out Nintendo doing

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:03.720
a press conference before Tokyo game show is nothing new they do this all the time because

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.940
they don't participate in Tokyo game show and what does Nintendo have going for them

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:10.640
right now I already told you they're not gonna show the Wii U again I bet you that wasn't

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.380
at PAX was it that's one I don't think so that's one thing I did call right they didn't

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.620
show the Wii U at PAX something this show they don't have anything it's like a proof

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:23.260
of concept still yeah exactly it's too soon so they're not showing it now either and they're

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:26.020
not taking it Tokyo game show and it's not this so what else does Nintendo have going

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:31.220
on right now the 3ds so this is probably where they're going to announce what we have to

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:36.120
look forward to in 2012 whatever that might be I don't know it's probably too early to

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:43.500
say so but I don't think a redo of the 3ds is one of them now if here's what I am here's

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:48.980
what they could do is if it's true that they're going that direction they could announce the

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:54.840
plug at this Tokyo like whatever plug is going to give you that second analog stick they

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:59.460
could announce that and if that's announced then you fucking know what a new systems coming

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:04.340
out in 2012 but I just my gut tells me no I think they still have to really prove this

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:09.200
for you know it's kind of like one of those they've they've put it out there they need

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:15.500
to stand behind it it's not good why why why would you do that because that's basically

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:19.540
saying you know what we fucked up we should have put a second analog stick on there no

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:24.500
you can't do that six months out you know you just say you know what damn it you know

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:28.260
we should have put a second analog stick on it well our next console is going to have

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:34.860
to have one you know it people will live I mean the PSP did just fine one analog stick

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:40.420
granted it's suck you know that they're you know some games have to use the buttons to

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:46.380
have a second analog stick but you know what we can use the touchpad as much as I hate

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:50.780
doing it as a second analog stick or just make games that don't require a second analog

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:56.860
stick gripper oh one in our chat room says pretty assuredly he's she he says it's a mother

01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:03.220
collection for the 3ds hi I wish my friend I don't think so yeah yeah they're gonna be

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:09.720
announcing that also it's gonna be bundled with last story and you know I I would say

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.940
so they're probably just gonna like focus on Kingdom Hearts maybe give a date for Kid

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:18.900
Icarus and some of the stuff we already know about and maybe like a new Nintendo we have

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:24.380
it there right now are no dates for Kid Icarus and the two Mario games well then maybe that's

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:27.380
what we're gonna hear we're gonna get some dates finally I think that's what you're gonna

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:32.820
get out of this and maybe a teaser of some Nintendo franchise coming back on the DS in

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:37.360
2012 I would think like zero the fanboy in me really wants to say f-zero but not with

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.320
Mario Kart still not out fan f-zero is still a ways out Pikmin seems like a pretty logical

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:48.340
choice some type of Pikmin game or like a Donkey Kong on the on the 3ds they those seem

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:55.860
like very logical candidates especially Pikmin Actraiser 3 he's trying to do to me don't

01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:04.140
troll me all right other speaking of we screwed up so forth the ambassador program some more

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:07.140
details came out on that we kind of referenced it at the top of the show but if you didn't

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:11.220
hear the free Nintendo games are now available to those that bought the 3ds they came out

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.740
a little early actually they came out the night before they were supposed to and I think

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:20.260
that's because it was the first in Japan it was like the you know the 31st of August here

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:25.140
and the full list of games that you can get for free NES games Super Mario Brothers Donkey

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:31.020
Kong jr. balloon fight ice climber Legend of Zelda Metroid NES open tournament golf

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:36.940
wrecking crew Yoshi and Zelda to the adventure of link those are the games that came out

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:41.780
Yoshi by the way is not Yoshi's cookie it but it's a different puzzler it's it's kind

01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:45.820
of crap it's the one where Mario was on the bottom and you can flip the things around

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:50.180
and you line up the characters and a little Yoshi eggs it's bad I played it I was like

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:54.580
oh this was not a good puzzler game they kept trying to it's like they had really good success

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:58.980
with Tetris and then dr. Mario isn't it a columns clone and columns isn't very good

01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:04.760
either I guess it's kind of like columns but not really Mario's at the bottom and he flips

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.900
these platters around and that's that's what you're doing but I don't know I don't want

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.340
to talk too much about Yoshi it's not worth your time they really should have just done

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:16.140
dr. Mario see ya but you have five I would say in that list you have like five epic Nintendo

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:23.980
games Mario Brothers Zelda Zelda to Metroid and out of Donkey Kong jr. balloon fight an

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:28.620
ice climber probably one of those you go that's epic too is something that speaks to your

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:35.980
interest and then the rest of those stinkers but you know whatever again but whatever I

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:39.860
don't think I still I still to this day say Nintendo really didn't have to do anything

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:45.320
yeah so for them I mean when you early adopt this is the risk you take and so I think it's

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:48.900
neat that the games are out and that I didn't have to pay for them and I look forward to

01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:52.780
the advanced games as well but having metroid in my pocket is kind of rad not gonna lie

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:58.000
it's kind of nice so looking forward to seeing how that multiplayer and all that stuff pulls

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.020
out because it might make a game like ice climber way more fun to be able to like actually

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.660
play that are they adding that later on I think so they were supposed to be doing that

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:08.380
for the NES like same room multiplayer but no longer with the cords that you had on the

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:13.740
Gameboy old school and all that and then of course as I already mentioned there are rumors

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:19.340
about a redesigned 3ds it's coming from a French website 01.net and normally you would

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.780
write that off as oh well who cares it's just some website to know what they're talking

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:28.780
about however I believe this is the same website that talked about what else did they blow

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:33.580
the lid on before they broke the Wii U and they broke the PS Vita and those specs so

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:38.380
it's kind of one of those they were right on these so take this early this but that's

01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:43.460
where the whole rumor of the second stick comes from this the second analog stick rumor

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:49.620
for the PSP original plague to that console for years and years and eventually there were

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:53.460
leaked photos of what if they were all fake I can see him doing if they want to do like

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:57.980
an Excel or something like that that doesn't piss me off big deal so it has a larger screen

01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:02.940
you know I'll I'll get over that but you know the change it so much to where oh we're gonna

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:08.460
play a second analog so come on that's that's gonna piss people off yeah it's like the expression

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:13.740
you've made your bed now lie in it you know Final Fantasy 14 and they're not just coming

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:18.500
out with a new game yeah I mean it's just like well shouldn't this been part of the

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:23.180
it's just like it's not as bad as like Wii motion plus or something like that but it

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:27.220
is pretty bad it's like yeah we really should have had these extra sensors in there but

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:31.900
we want to drop the crap you know the cost of this but now we're just like yeah we're

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:36.580
gonna fuck you guys so um what made him change their mind though if this is true I still

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:42.060
I mean I realize this website has a record and so forth you know people have said the

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.820
same thing about us like why believe them when we were right on something early but

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:50.340
um I don't know I there's still a big grain of salt I'm taking this with but I feel like

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:55.100
well why would they suddenly change their mind maybe it's developer pressure maybe because

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:59.380
the lack of games you know there's been a lack of games in the beginning here maybe

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:03.540
it's because they're worried that they're not gonna be able to you know port the hardcore

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.220
games over like some of these first person shooters or whatever the you know like a Call

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:12.700
of Duty you know Modern Warfare 3 is not gonna be able to be on that because we're not gonna

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:17.900
be sitting here after Christmas going there's a lack of games on the 3DS how could you be

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:22.980
you have Mario Kart Mario Kid Icarus all coming out by the end of the year and a bunch of

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:27.100
third party stuff those are pretty strong games and it's gonna be enough for the 3DS

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:30.620
granted it should have been what the system launched with but whatever 3DS is gonna be

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:34.980
in a much better position come December than it is currently you know what I mean like

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:38.660
it's like I feel like this whole like there's no games for 3DS that's that arguments gonna

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:44.980
get old at the end of the year and it's gonna be difficult to you know I wouldn't think

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:50.140
that they would announce like a revision to their system right before the holiday yeah

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:54.180
what that would be shooting yourself in the foot for real that would be just dumb of them

01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:59.740
to do but again like I said a minute ago they could be working on that and this French website

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:03.940
might be right but that doesn't mean that's what they're announcing before the Tokyo Game

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:07.700
Show Nintendo always does a press conference before the Tokyo Game Show because they don't

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:13.820
participate I'll tell you what they're doing they're doing some sort of bundle it's like

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:19.180
oh look it's a Mario console with Mario okay yeah that makes sense I'm with you yeah absolutely

01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:24.260
did they already announce something like that really and that's a red console but yeah I

01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:28.540
bundle makes sense perfect sense and I think I think there will be a tease of a new game

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:34.660
in 2012 yeah we still have that Smash Brothers game and I want to play and this is weird

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:39.900
I want to play that Lego City stories because that is fucking Grand Theft Auto I recognize

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:43.940
Grand Theft Auto I played enough Grand Theft Auto to know what Grand Theft Auto is and

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:48.220
that's fucking Grand Theft Auto and it also has the same moniker as the PSP Grand Theft

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:52.300
Autos hold on a minute you don't care that it's Lego though and it's made by rockstar

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:58.060
games I'll play that shit all right fair enough by the way we have some comments in our chat

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:04.020
room going back to talking about the games that were in the ambassador pack let's see

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:09.660
balloon fight act F says balloon fight is awesome and Sonic m88 says I love balloon

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:13.780
fight and orange right says balloon fight is only good for balloon trips there's there's

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:18.460
a lot of love for balloon fight in the chat and some some some in the middle of the road

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:23.020
but yeah balloon fight if you never played it is basically Nintendo's joust ripoff you

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:26.900
know joust the game where you you'll flap a little birdie it's like that but with balloons

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:31.200
but yeah what made the game stand out was that it had this mode called balloon trip

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:38.020
where now imagine joust as a side scrolling game that's what balloon trip is except it

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:42.920
scrolls the wrong way too which is interesting it scrolls the other way but I think it's

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:52.100
I think it's neat so all right so let's move on with some more news so I should pop a former

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:58.300
take to interactive employee is suing them and is also trying to scrape up some other

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:04.260
people that might have the same grievances as him for a class action suit is suing them

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:11.540
for unpaid wages when he was a employee in their quality assurance department which is

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:18.820
based in California and basically saying he worked overtime didn't get paid for it doesn't

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:23.640
really say how he left the firm whether if he was laid off fired or quit but he says

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:29.740
that there's a lot of unpaid wages owed to him and other people in the QA department

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:34.640
that he's trying to get together for the class action suit also in the state of California

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:41.060
they're very strict on if you work eight hour days you have to get a 30 minute lunch like

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:44.900
by law legally they have to give you that and also breaks 15 minute breaks every couple

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:49.740
of hours he's also saying he's saying that they basically said too bad so sad for you

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:53.580
you don't get those lunches and breaks because of crunch time where they had to get a game

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:58.020
out the door so I guess the QA department was written really hard and he's trying to

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:03.740
sue them for the fact that they had that department run with no lunches or breaks and had people

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:10.180
who weren't salary their hours hourly employees not getting paid for their overtime and he

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:14.940
worked he started working there in December of 2006 it doesn't say when he left the firm

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:20.660
and the case the original complaint was filed in June of 2010 so this is already a little

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:25.420
over a year old but legal things are always so slow I always go to snail's pace and it

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:31.540
looks like it hasn't been thrown out or anything so this may actually go to trial you know

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:36.660
he's trying to scrounge up multiple people to both strengthen his case and also to get

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:40.540
the class action thing going I kind of hope it does go to trial because I feel like I've

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:45.180
got nothing else to say on this because I'm not in this dude's shoes you know and it's

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.200
one of those cases where I think there's always you know there's three sides to every story

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:54.420
right your side my side and the truth right and so I'm I kind of want something like this

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:58.280
to go to trial just so we can kind of hear like I know we always hear those horror stories

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:03.700
in the industry about you know what these claims he's making totally seems legit based

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:11.460
on other things we've heard from other companies when I worked in a call center when we had

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:18.620
you know like in a call center your your company has these service level agreements like you

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:22.420
won't be on hold for more than two minutes all that bullcrap our wait times were like

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:28.940
40 minutes so our metrics were total shit show and I was working 10 hour days and basically

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:32.380
they said we're going to put you down for a 30 minute lunch but if you could only make

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:39.900
it 20 eat fast and you know could you do that because we're really short on call coverage

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:43.940
you know that's the kind of shit they pull in real sweatshop environments like a QA Center

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:47.420
where you've got all of these testers trying to get a product out the door because it has

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:52.100
to go gold in a certain amount of time I think basically what I'm saying is I've experienced

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:58.580
that firsthand where I've worked at a job where management was like can you can you

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:03.580
eat at your desk while working also this is such a tricky scenario because you do want

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:07.380
to say you know yeah stick it to the man stick it to the corporation so forth and these things

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:10.420
should be fair but then you kind of also look at the other hand and go well they'll probably

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:14.020
just turn around out sources to another country because that's unfortunate where a lot of

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:18.280
these jobs are going and I don't want to get too political and so forth but I mean that's

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:24.260
just the world we're in right now you know what I mean and we've even heard of QA jobs

01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:30.460
being outsourced and so forth and I at the same time I don't think that it's right that

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:36.180
somebody has to not claim time or you know not say the accurate time they worked or what

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:41.060
have you but I think there needs to be better foresight in the planning of games and it's

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:47.740
oh shock and awe mismanagement in all of these cases right mismanagement bad staffing planning

01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:52.780
bad you know what a shocker well yeah it's because the managers they're managing these

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:59.020
employees probably get paid on how early the game is done and they get a bonus based on

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:04.660
that so they want their bonus to be big because it's all about their pocket money and people

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:09.500
fear that if they don't comply you know what and and such pop when you were in that situation

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:15.780
what were you gonna do tell them no well in my case when I had to work the mandatory overtime

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:21.780
I was paid for it but um yeah it's like this is really shitty and I want to walk out of

01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:25.740
this building for 30 minutes and clear my head but I can't because they're basically

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:30.100
telling me that I don't get a lunch but I got rent to pay I got to pay bills I'm not

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:33.540
just gonna flip them off and quit your job will end up overseas if you don't do it yeah

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:41.020
so and that's like that's that's the real problem that's and is there an easy answer

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:46.020
I don't know but I guess the the fact that this guy is making such a big complaint it

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:52.020
sounds like this is a pretty widespread you know supported by management abuse of an entire

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:56.860
department rather than you know an ugly week where they had to do sketchy things it sounds

01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:00.660
like this was just really and the release the case that he's trying to present is that

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:06.300
they you know it was run that the QA department was run very terribly based on on how long

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:09.540
we've been doing this show or how long you all have been listening in the stories we

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:13.660
read week in and week out about what happens in the gaming world does this lawsuit surprise

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:22.380
anybody any anyone surprised now why not just comes with the industry exactly but does that

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:29.120
make it right no well also um so he he's an ex take to interactive employee the division

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:36.300
that he was in is now called visual concepts formerly 2k sports that held the Sega sports

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:44.060
licenses so I can imagine in a that QA environment if you know EA's BS they're putting out the

01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:50.540
new Madden or whatever they need to get their game out in time for what EA is doing so basically

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:55.860
all of the sports games that take two has put out since 2006 those are the games that

01:20:55.860 --> 01:21:01.380
would have been affected by this QA department so I could definitely see how you know if

01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:05.380
Madden comes out and your game is supposed to come out a week before and you don't make

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:09.860
your gold pressing of it then that's Monday down the drain well let's let's see it go

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:14.740
to trial I want to see I might might I want to see this case defended I want to see what

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:18.900
happens I want to say that for once can we not settle out of court and let's let's do

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:22.980
it the good old American way and waste taxpayer monies on the on an actual courtroom trial

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:27.860
lawsuit because this is something I'm generally I would like to see how this plays out but

01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:33.380
it'll get settled they all do yeah if they take this unless this guy's totally full of

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:39.660
crap and he doesn't have the documentation it very well could be and we just don't know

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:44.500
but I think it says something that we look at this and we go yeah not too surprising

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:49.620
right I mean so I think we're kind of saying well this doesn't sound like it's full of

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:53.220
shit I mean it could be in this case we don't know this guy this guy could just be a bitter

01:21:53.220 --> 01:22:01.660
Betty but we don't know that's why it has to go to trial so we can find out anyway let's

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:05.740
move on with more gaming news oh yeah well we thought it was gonna be a short show tonight

01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:13.100
we're already an hour and a half into part a anyhow we'll go quick on you watch so Sony

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:19.940
is talking smack about Microsoft yeah when when they're are they not basically their

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:24.720
comment is publishers are getting the living crack or living crap kicked out of them by

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:32.600
Microsoft according to Rob Dyer Sony's SVP of public relations yes he is an expert of

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:37.820
everything that Microsoft does basically there is a recent interview concerning Microsoft's

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:46.140
publishing policies basically the thing that he was pissed off about was Microsoft's content

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:52.580
submission and release policy which forbids its games from being released first or with

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:59.780
exclusive content on other platforms so for example titles for Xbox 360 must ship at least

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:06.320
simultaneously with other video game platforms and must have at least or have at least feature

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:12.940
and content parity on disk with other video game platform versions in all regions where

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:17.380
the title is available if these conditions are not met Microsoft reserves the right to

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:22.620
not allow content to be released on the Xbox 360 it's actually interesting for a few reasons

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:28.300
because I know for a fact like was a Dead Space 2 and stuff they had you know content

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:35.820
that was on the blu-ray version of you know the for the ps3 and that wasn't on 360 version

01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:45.180
you mean like what it was the HD remake of Dead Space the Wii one that they had you know

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:51.980
the on-rails shooter one they had that and then also I believe on the battlefield 3 might

01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:56.860
have something there's is like the original battlefield 1942 I think was supposed to be

01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:02.180
on one of this it's a lot of EA games they'll do that where they'll have exclusive thingies

01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:07.420
so but we don't know if this is really true or not right this is according to their policy

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:13.180
I don't know of course you know Xbox is defending them they're saying we're a little biased

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:19.460
so obviously we're gonna look to our product or to protect our own space as best we can

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:24.740
and get exclusivity in other words we're gonna bully the shit out of everyone so that we

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:28.920
don't die it's like I think I think what Chris and other representatives at Microsoft are

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:33.820
doing is protecting inferior technology and this is according to that Rob Dyer again if

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:39.020
they I think they want to dumb it down and keep it as pedestrian as possible so that

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:43.260
if you want to do anything on blu-ray or if you have extra content above nine gigs or

01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:48.140
you want to do anything of that nature you better sure as heck remember that Microsoft

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:55.620
can't handle that I just bickering ballots it's almost like the exact same story the

01:24:55.620 --> 01:25:00.060
salacious pop just read except this time it's not the manager it's Microsoft using their

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:04.500
whole to strong arm developers to get what they want because they're out there in the

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:09.680
marketplace more than PlayStation but see here's here's where I kind of question this

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:14.900
whole thing I have a big question mark about this not just the examples you gave but Japan

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:21.540
Microsoft can't get away with this in Japan no how could they possibly and maybe even

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.900
Europe I don't know what the sales numbers look like in Europe but I think you know America's

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:29.620
the only place for the Xbox really dominates the ps3 and that gap is closing I think is

01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:34.420
important to note too so this might be Microsoft's way to kind of make sure that the Xbox doesn't

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:39.540
die but it's going to have the reverse effect isn't it like I look at this ago this is just

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:43.100
done this is already if this is already in effect I don't think it's really hurting the

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:49.940
many I don't know it's just but if Sony were to do the same thing who loses the consumer

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:54.740
well that's what here's what you didn't just do then it's pretty simple and they were done

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:59.980
this is you put out free download content you put a voucher in in the game and you get

01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:05.140
free download content on PlayStation 3 it falls within all that no here's what you do

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:10.740
you make your game for the PlayStation 3 and fuck the 360 I mean if that's if you think

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:15.600
you've got a good enough game I mean PlayStation 3 is allowed to have good exclusives and they

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:22.180
do have good exclusive souls and little big planet yeah but sometimes it it helps to have

01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:26.760
the whole market share of Xbox 360 as well because you know they have more of a market

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:31.560
share than the PlayStation 3 and yeah there's good exclusives coming on to the PlayStation

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:36.740
but I mean if it's that minor of a thing if you're just adding a few extra missions or

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:40.220
whatever you can do is free yellow content it still falls within the requirements that

01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:45.860
they want and you can still market it as an exclusive I'm not trying to come off as a

01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:50.540
Sony fanboy either because I do love a lot of what Microsoft's done with Xbox I mean

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:55.860
obviously Xbox Live Arcade is something everybody's trying to copy now Xbox Live set the bar and

01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:01.100
so forth granted I liked Microsoft a lot more before my account was hacked for 125 bucks

01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:05.140
I've been able to play for three weeks but I digress there's a lot of things that Microsoft

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:10.820
does right but the unfortunate thing is this type of act of desperation is almost what

01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:15.020
this sounds like I think that quote about trying to make up for inferior technology

01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:18.480
really hits the nail on the head yeah it's kind of like they're using their clout in

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:24.860
the marketplace to bring the PlayStation down to their level because they're not capable

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:29.260
of coming up to Sony's level hardware wise perfect example and I'm sure this hasn't been

01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:35.980
announced yet rage rages on one blu-ray on the PlayStation 3 rages on three to four DVDs

01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:42.620
on the Xbox 360 that sucks it's not a big deal I don't give a shit about this deal I

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:47.980
don't give a shit fantasy 13 was on several DVDs didn't really change the game lost odyssey

01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:56.180
yeah wasn't it the atlas game Catherine that came out there isn't room on a 360 360 disc

01:27:56.180 --> 01:28:02.540
for the Japanese dialogue with English subtitles so because they can't fit it on the 360 version

01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:06.820
they took it off of the ps3 version is that right or else or else the 360 words and what's

01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:13.260
gonna sell it think so because I mean I've seen you know ISO rips of that and Catherine's

01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:20.500
not that big a game it's like it's 40 45 gigs I mean they've got room but I I just think

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:26.420
they didn't bother sometimes they just don't put the extra language track in there I mean

01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:29.860
a lot of video games don't put the Japanese language tracks in sometimes game fighting

01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:34.380
games and so forth do but you know the the speech in that is very short but you know

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:38.780
most role-playing games out there don't and I don't have it's not an RPG but most RPGs

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.660
don't bother with the second track it's actually kind of really cool when they have it there

01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:49.180
you know and you can play in either language but very rare right so anyway I guess we'll

01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:54.460
see if this kind of holds out to be I don't I want to say if it holds out to be true but

01:28:54.460 --> 01:29:02.120
it I guess we are hearing it is kind of fact but you have some cases where it's not so

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:06.180
yeah I mean I don't know when this one effect if it's just something that they just now

01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:10.940
put out but all I know is like I know that there's been titles and I think there's some

01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:20.860
that haven't come out yet I actually I know another perfect example for was it of course

01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:27.580
now that the titles of disappear Bioshock Infinite is going to have the first Bioshock

01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:34.060
game on disk for the PlayStation 3 version not so much on the 360 because they have the

01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:39.860
extra space for that but I know EA think had I want to say is 19 Battlefield 1942 I'm not

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:43.500
sure if that was on the PlayStation 3 version of Battlefield 3 but one of these games is

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:48.340
coming out had they did a few of these like that were had like another game on the disk

01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:52.700
because they have so much space Microsoft's got to be but I mean look Microsoft's got

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:57.780
to be a little worried because it for the first time in this whole generation of games

01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:03.300
where it's been PS3 versus Xbox we were hearing a lot more favorable things about the or about

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:10.860
the PlayStation 3 back in May was a May when Portal 2 and Mortal Kombat came out most people

01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:14.820
opted to get those games on the PlayStation 3 and that was really the first time you were

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:19.500
hearing that because you had an extra character on the PlayStation 3 version Kratos right

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:23.380
of Mortal Kombat and when it came to Portal 2 you had the whole steam integration and

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:28.180
a free copy on the PC I mean which wasn't even remotely close to what the 360 could

01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:35.260
offer and again I'm not trying to dog on 360 360 is is proven the better system and then

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:40.820
a PlayStation 3 in some cases but you know I think now it's going to a point where Xbox

01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:46.260
can't just kind of rest on their laurels of well we were the cheaper system for so long

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:49.980
that more people have Xboxes in their houses than they do PlayStations because that gap

01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:53.580
is slowly closing at the end of the day it's going to be the games that speak for themselves

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:57.380
it's going to take developers if these rules are true is standing up to these rules and

01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:03.180
saying forget it we can survive as a PlayStation 3 exclusive it worked for Demon Souls it worked

01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:10.660
for you know whatever other first-party Sony games are out there and 3d game heroes and

01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:18.300
so forth so guys you know in chat says la noir wouldn't have so much DLC if they ran

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:23.940
it on PlayStation 3 only and maybe sometimes the DLC is part of the whole plan we're gonna

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:29.300
get you to pay 60 bucks and then another 20 paid unlock exactly paid unlock content all

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:34.180
right quickly let's talk about a Wii game that's right a new Wii game more information

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:38.940
coming out on it tonight Square Enix is going to be revealing more information about Dragon

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:47.460
Quest on Ustream at 2 p.m. Japan time September 5th that's 10 o'clock Pacific tonight so in

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:51.260
about two hours they'll be starting that event who knows we might still be live at this pace

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:56.260
tonight but they're probably gonna be showing more information on Dragon Quest 10 although

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:59.960
it could be a new announcement they announced a long time ago some of you forgot Dragon

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:03.580
Quest 10 is going to be coming on the Wii they said that back in 2008 but they have

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:08.700
yet to show off anything about the game it's going to be interesting to see if they stick

01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:14.500
to their guns and they put this game out on the Wii relatively late in the Wii's lifecycle

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:17.740
because they would have to announce this and really have a date ready to go relatively

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:23.420
soon I worry it's gonna suffer a little bit from what Dragon Quest 8 suffered from and

01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:27.460
that was it came out he was on the ps2 right towards the end it was on the ps2 at the very

01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:31.500
very end and it's the same thing that hurt Final Fantasy 12 both those games came out

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:35.940
I don't think very far apart from each other and both those games you know for the hardcore

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:39.380
gamer got overlooked a little bit because everybody was putting 360s and Wiis in their

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:46.180
homes and so forth just 360s and other new stuff 7 was ps1 right so they've been really

01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:50.460
like those games don't have really come out as often as they used to know and the Dragon

01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:54.860
Quest 9 was on the DS obviously and now 10 is you know was announced some time ago on

01:32:54.860 --> 01:33:00.980
the Wii because for a while there especially back in 2008 it seemed like the Wii was everything

01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:04.700
it's going to be interesting to see if they stuck to that or if maybe one of the announcements

01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:09.460
we're getting today is and it might show up on other systems I kind of don't think they'll

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:14.820
do that keep in mind Dragon Quest is still a very Japanese centric game yeah Dragon Quest

01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:18.980
9 everyone went clown shit for that game in Japan and over here like people that know

01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:22.900
what Dragon Quest is bought it but it wasn't the phenomenon that it wasn't that it was

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:28.860
over there you can I bet your ass it's not coming out on Xbox period it's just not you

01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:36.780
know it's a Japanese game and Xbox is not what it is here PlayStation 3 I just don't

01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:41.500
think so I don't think they have a need to maybe Dragon Quest 11 probably not Dragon

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:48.980
Quest 10 well I mean different studio obviously but through the 360 did have Blue Dragon which

01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:55.340
was by what mist Walker studio and also the artwork was Akira Toriyama who did Dragon

01:33:55.340 --> 01:34:00.220
Ball Z and Dragon Quest so there's that connection there it wouldn't be unheard of it came out

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:04.700
on the 360 because we've had a game that looks like it already true true all right so we'll

01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:09.100
see what happens by the time most of you are hearing this on the podcast actually we'll

01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:12.940
have more information on that so be looking for that on Labor Day by the way just real

01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:17.380
quick there is going to be a Dragon Quest 10 trailer in the Wii anniversary collection

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:21.260
I mean this just really strengthens that yes they're committed to the Wii I don't know

01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:26.980
if you've heard but they are bundling I think it's 1 2 3 and the Super Nintendo remakes

01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:32.820
of 1 & 2 are all going to be on a Wii anniversary debt disc it's very it's like that Mario collection

01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:37.380
they did it's like that for Dragon Quest which is cool but it won't be it won't be on the

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:42.380
U.S. to be fair though it's still more content that was on that fucking Mario disc hey Lisa

01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:45.980
you know what they put more than one game on there guess what Nintendo you could have

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:52.780
done that those discs they can hold more than a Super NES ROM well it's just 1 2 & 3 I would

01:34:52.780 --> 01:35:01.640
have loved to see that rip one meg it's like okay I'm looking for a disc I'm I wish that

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:05.180
anniversary collection would come out in the U.S. actually I really love the first Dragon

01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:14.420
Quest game excuse me Dragon Warrior remember so all right anyhow that is coming out by

01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:19.700
the time most of you guys hear this so look for it so let's pop a couple weeks ago we

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:25.800
we reported on a story about the video game history museum project and how they were trying

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:30.660
to get the money they needed to get the thing off the ground the video game history museum

01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:33.460
is I think it's not like it's just three or four dudes that are running this and they

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:38.460
usually have an exhibit at the classic gaming Expo in Las Vegas where they would have floor

01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:47.420
space for their video game history pieces and all the information there and they really

01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:53.180
wanted to give this thing a permanent home somewhere in the Silicon Valley near the San

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:58.780
Jose sort of you know the southern Bay Area of California which of course is where Apple

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:04.100
and Google and eBay and all of those companies are located I'm also I think EA is down there

01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:11.140
and I'd awesome so that's that's where it's going to be and their Kickstarter was a success

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:18.980
and the story is that they are $20,000 over what they initially wanted I got the oh I

01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:24.420
had the Kickstarter page open but I closed it but it's like I think they had 700 donors

01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:34.140
and the target goal was 30,000 on their Kickstarter page and now they're at 50 something so yeah

01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:40.540
no real update yet as to you know whether like what what the building's gonna look like

01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:44.580
or if they actually have a space for it like bought if they're gonna buy the plot to build

01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:49.860
it on but yeah they made their money so hopefully within maybe a couple years we'll have a permanent

01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:57.800
video game Hall of Fame history museum in California for us to go to why remember kind

01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:02.180
of reporting on this a couple weeks ago and it sounded kind of cool at the time so I'm

01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:07.140
glad they kind of you know got their kinks worked out what have you so what do you say

01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:11.660
road trip actually I've seen their exhibit at Classic Gaming Expo before and it's pretty

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:16.420
cool so I think it's neat that they're kind of going to have a place for this and if you

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:23.580
go to their Kickstarter page which I can find and post into chat if you dare certain landmarks

01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:31.180
if you donate 10 20 $50 and so on there are perks that you get once the museum is a reality

01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:36.840
like a ticket to admission or something like VIP a ticket to get in first before everyone

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:44.420
else or whatever yeah creative most most Kickstarter pages are like that right right all right

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:48.060
well let's go around the world and check out some release dates and see what is coming

DVD is seriously that layer don't forget some games like Mario Galaxy and Xenoblade are

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:06.580
doing they should have put on a dual layer that just to be extravagant that this great

01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:11.340
there has so little on it you can literally put your fingers and rub it all over the disk

01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:14.820
and it would be just fine you know what you could do is if you you know if you were into

01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:21.340
the the backup quote unquote you know what I'm saying you could do a GameCube size disc

01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:26.180
and put the ROM on that and load it off a GameCube disk but with the we know it was

01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:32.720
a we disk I don't know it's just that's pathetic is what it is they really should just really

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:38.540
say no matter why you mad though and then lastly let's see a cyber beast is talking

01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:42.740
about I really need the Nyko or Nikko zoom that's the whole thing on the connect and

01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:46.700
yeah I got delayed wasn't supposed to be coming a hole would have been out already if it was

01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:53.340
coming out in time but it's September now well and Japan's getting it and I I want one

01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:57.880
too I it's I think so many people are interested in that and by the way if you haven't heard

01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:02.140
of that that's the thing that you can actually put on your connect and it will help a smaller

01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:05.300
room be more effective with the we like it's just it's basically like a wide-angle lens

01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:10.280
basically for your connect the connect and it's a great idea and I wonder if Microsoft

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:14.500
isn't going to just kind of change the connect because it seems like one of the this is so

01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:19.460
badly needed you know so we'll see all right anyhow let's move on with a couple more quick

01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:28.460
stories for you guys Loki avalanche the developers behind the just cause series they have some

01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:35.660
comments regarding DRM they believe it's a threat to the entertaining experience basically

01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:46.540
was it a Christopher Sundberg he said if a DRM system constantly needs to be defended

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:51.940
something must be wrong as a developer you will never win over any fans if you constantly

01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:58.420
let everyone know how much it costs to develop a game and how much money you lose I don't

01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:03.860
like always on DRM solutions at all since they offer nothing to the consumer if you

01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:09.820
continuously give something extra for registering and being online and award them for actually

01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:15.880
playing a pain for and playing your game it'd be different but always on DRM says thank

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:20.420
you for buying our game we trust you as far as we can throw you and yeah that kind of

01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:25.140
makes sense and I love how Ubisoft likes to spin it oh well you know what if you buy our

01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:31.860
game and this isn't even necessarily always on stuff this is I would say going to the

01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:37.060
the little codes that you have with your new games where you get multiplayer we're offering

01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:42.940
you free multiplayer with this code no you would have had multiplayer in there anyways

01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:48.020
but you're being a dick is what it is you just don't want people you know to be on your

01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:57.220
online service if they didn't buy the game new whatever I just it's stupid well isn't

01:46:57.220 --> 01:47:02.580
it true that when all this DRM stuff kind of the person that loses is the people that

01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:07.820
are buying these games legitimately exactly and I I'm very curious and I will definitely

01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:14.220
be reporting on that how quickly the DRM gets cracked on driver it will be fast I guarantee

01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:21.620
it all right well before we get to the classic game of the week tonight we have a new segment

01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:25.820
here on orange lounge radio because you know we just see we see too many new stories that

01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:30.140
are like this and so we just need to give it its own segment on the show and it's called

01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:46.060
local news making gamers look bad that's right local game for local news making gamers look

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:52.420
bad and for tonight's local news making gamers look bad we're going to go to the station

01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:59.320
WSB TV channel 2 and where are they located they're in Georgia but I don't think they're

01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:03.500
in Atlanta station I think they're like northern Georgia so we're gonna get to a story that

01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:09.740
they ran this week that I captured some of the gaming blogs about pornographic drawings

01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:14.980
that were found inside a used Wii game and I know what you're thinking this isn't really

01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:20.220
a news story I really this makes it on the news yet no this is this is the whole point

01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:26.100
of this segment it's local news making gamers look bad so yes it does have to do with gaming

01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:30.220
because it's your local news station oh it isn't Atlanta station it's action news 2 in

01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:34.020
Atlanta oh Bobby had had a show tonight he would have been all over this this is in his

01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:39.380
backyard this isn't by the way the town and remember this in the back your mind coming

01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:45.100
Georgia and that's c-u-m-m-i-n-g like I'm coming right that's exactly where the story

01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:52.700
takes place so here we go pornographic drawings from action news 2 in Atlanta when a six-year-old

01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:57.940
boy found pornographic drawings inside the box of a Nintendo Wii game the packaging says

01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:02.660
it's suitable for everyone channel Napier Viteri is live tonight in Forsyth County with

01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:07.600
the discovery parents were not prepared to explain Amy and I apologize for the audio

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:12.420
is very very low on this I might have to fix it in post-production a little bit but again

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:21.720
the local internet news is very not good at equalizing their audio so sorry Jervita Tracy

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:26.260
Turner bought her six-year-old son this game at a local GameStop it says on the on the

01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:31.420
outside of the box rated E for everyone but what he found inside is for mature adults

01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:37.020
only let's find this one Tracy Turner has a stack of kid-friendly video games for six-year-old

01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:46.400
JT and four-year-old Madison the kids are cute I'm not gonna talk bad about the kids

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:51.060
and it's it's cute that they do have these Wii games that they play so her son pick out

01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:54.700
this game for their Wii system it's rated by the way it's this the game they're showing

01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:57.740
I don't know why they don't name it this is kind of like when the local news here did

01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:01.760
the story on us and then never named our station remember that they were doing the story on

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.620
podcasting and they interviewed us but they never said it was Orange Lawns radio they

01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:08.980
just said these are three local guys that do podcasts about video games never named

01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:14.300
it the game that they're looking at here is Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games okay E

01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:18.340
for everyone appropriate for all ages but when her son and some of his friends opened

01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:23.420
the box the images he found inside were anything but they were extremely inappropriate it was

01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:28.440
very of sexual nature Turner showed me the drawings on the inside cover they show sexually

01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:33.960
suggestive images and detailed human anatomy my favorite part is that they show and I realize

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:38.000
it's a radio show but they're showing parts of the picture cropped yeah but they're very

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.560
cropped so it just looks like it looks like these happy little faces and somebody does

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:45.980
have some artistic talent here it looks like some it looks like someone just drew stick

01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:50.620
figures with like a giant dong or something on it with like it with like a sharpie marker

01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:55.660
exactly exactly not prepared for to answer the questions of what was going on in the

01:50:55.660 --> 01:51:00.260
picture so Turner tells me she called GameStop to let them know what was included in their

01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:04.380
merchandise she says an employee thanked her for calling and hung up she even called the

01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:08.300
corporate office but tells me she got the same response it kind of shocking because

01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:13.300
I expected them to like have a little bit more of a reaction like I did oh my gosh that's

01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:19.420
bonus content okay you should be thanking us oh well didn't you know GameStop has the

01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:24.980
exclusive with Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games you get free wiener pics with every

01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:29.700
purchase how much sex goes on at the Olympics in real life okay I'll have you know that

01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:35.420
we should charge the extra for those wiener pics you bring it to us I apologize you know

01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:40.420
I'm so sorry you know like let me see you know like something else and we just did not

01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:45.620
receive that I took the game cover and went to the GameStop in coming wow this is investigative

01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:50.660
journalism and I love this shot of the reporter walking in the GameStop like I'm gonna go

01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:54.620
march on in there and get to the bottom of what happened here to the same employee who

01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:59.180
took Turner's call she says no one apologized that you just said thanks for letting us know

01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:03.840
and then hung up I actually apologized to her five times I also called the corporate

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:08.700
office and someone told me they would get back to me these compelling shots of the reporter

01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:12.980
on her iPhone like I'm calling them right now and I'm looking very intently at the phone

01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:20.900
motive I just wanted them to say I'm sorry I got an email from GameStop's corporate office

01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:25.340
this evening asking me for Turner's information so they can look into what happened further

01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:29.580
as for Turner she tells me from now on she's going to buy new games spend a few more dollars

01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:34.100
so she can avoid this happening again we're live in Forsyth County Amy Napier-Viteri channel

01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:39.060
2 action news Nightbeat that's it it's propaganda propaganda from the developers and the publishers

01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:42.700
of these games they're just trying to get people to think you know what if I buy used

01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:47.900
I'm gonna get fucking dick pics in my my games buy new no dick pics in new games here's the

01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:55.380
thing I I'm not making fun of the mother because she has a legitimate complaint yes she she

01:52:55.380 --> 01:53:00.380
really does I mean the fact that it's on the fucking news in Atlanta is a little weird

01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:06.060
to me like okay but let's let's be real well let's let's just it's probably one of those

01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:11.580
things where she went to GameStop she got kind of like well thanks she got an apathetic

01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:16.780
and then so she went to one of those consumer activists you know that things and the local

01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:22.760
the local news feeds on that shit the local news feeds on that fucking like call the news

01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:28.060
center and and whatever show it is that works and sometimes you know they do they do help

01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:33.380
out like in cases of this isn't one of those cases that really need is like yeah that's

01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:38.700
unfortunate but but this is just a seized opportunity I mean for local news station

01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:43.980
this is really okay look at the what what does she want she wanted GameStop to fucking

01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:49.200
say sorry about that man like any of us in the GameStop employees shoes you know what

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:53.260
to say I'm really sorry to hear about that ma'am if you wouldn't wouldn't mind bringing

01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:57.140
the game back to the store we'll get you a full refund or we'll get you a replacement

01:53:57.140 --> 01:54:02.300
copy Dan you're shaking your head no you disagree get Dan a mic it's like we did get Dan a mic

01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:08.140
you disagree that the woman who would have just laughed at her you would have been like

01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:12.340
you got a game with drawings in it you're stupid and then hung up damn well that's not

01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:18.460
what you would have done I would have actually cop to drawing him would you have done it

01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:23.260
in a humorous way though no I don't know I would have had her if she was mad I would

01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:27.120
have just told her to bring the game but yeah exactly thank you Dan you bring the game back

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:32.060
and we'll replace the game or give you I would have replaced the game I just would have wanted

01:54:32.060 --> 01:54:35.860
to see what was done on the inside of the cover come on yes you would you replace the

01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:42.220
game and or give her money back give her a different manual it's it's a used game anyway

01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:46.020
like fucking GameStop makes hella money on those games you could have afforded to give

01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:51.700
more that's added value that's like a deus ex coupon but better all right you're not

01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:56.420
helping Dan no no I never help all right but you know to be honest and now it's on the

01:54:56.420 --> 01:55:00.660
local news because she didn't get that apology or that reaction that any one of us with a

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:05.860
shred of customer service in us knows that she should have had just an apology yeah so

01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:10.060
it sounds like the GameStop employee that obviously looked at the bass back of the disc

01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:17.740
to make sure it was scratched when they took the trade in failed to notice the PP drawings

01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:21.140
on the inside cover that the previous owner drew in there when he wanted to get his five

01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:25.780
bucks used credit which you know okay wake up call maybe GameStop needs to be thumbing

01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:29.620
through those pages I mean I wouldn't have thought to oh I better look through the manual

01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:34.360
to make sure no one drew a dick in here you know and to be fair the person who probably

01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:38.500
drew it probably forgot it was in there like if you do something stupid before usually

01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:42.940
before you sell a game back like remember back when it was cartridges and like if you

01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:46.440
name your character cunt like you're going to erase you're going to have the courtesy

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:50.980
probably to erase that file before you say oh all right some of you won't you get yeah

01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:55.780
you get a game from blockbuster and it's like boobs butts turd it's like Oregon Trail but

01:55:55.780 --> 01:56:01.540
you just name your Final Fantasy six characters after it I'm sorry you know they're like how

01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:05.900
old is six and four maybe they wouldn't know what's really going on but I would have like

01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:10.780
I would really ha ha that's funny yeah but here's my point guys is that is that this

01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:16.480
really isn't a big issue the woman has a legitimate complaint a manager needs to spank an associate

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:21.420
at the front line of game stop here and this this could be done Dan but it doesn't need

01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:25.420
to be on the fucking news gamers are dirty ass people though and that well and that's

01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:29.860
what this new story is conveyed it's like gamers are all sex crazed maniacs who draw

01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:37.140
pee-pees in Mario and Sonic at the Mario's got a pee-pee it gets way better than that

01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:41.180
I cannot even tell you the amount of times I was pulling in a system for trade and I

01:56:41.180 --> 01:56:47.700
popped open the disk drawer and there was porn in it it was a lot and not like you know

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:52.920
you know fake porn either like real fucking hardcore porn and you're just like really

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:57.460
pal you couldn't have like open it up and pulled your you know your disk out and put

01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:01.780
it away I just to get a reaction out of you though you know it was like people they were

01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:07.420
always like I can't believe oh my god you know you'd give them the disk you'd wipe off

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:13.860
your hands I swear to god I opened a disk once as a CD case and there was a cock ring

01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:21.220
inside I'm not even fucking with you and you can tell cuz it's got that funky latex e condom

01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:31.100
smell sort of thing going on oh my god close it is handed back said that's yours drugs

01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:37.160
there have been you know joints and shit in cases gamers are dirty ass people so someone

01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:43.220
graffiting inside their game cases and forgetting about it that's nothing PSP memory cards were

01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:47.380
awesome if you ever audited them the ones that we took on trade I bet you that like

01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:53.500
50% of them had porn on them we sold one to a kid once his mom came back she was so mad

01:57:53.500 --> 01:58:00.860
at us she's like don't you check this it's like no take it home format it you know if

01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:04.060
you're if you're 14 year old decided he was gonna look around on it and keep it on his

01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:11.900
PSP that's because he's a 14 year old who's not like LSD or something like that exactly

01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:16.180
so so you're saying you're what I'm hearing out of you Dan is that it could have been

01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:22.300
a lot fucking worse and this is nothing yeah gamers are skeevy fucking terrible people

01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:26.860
you guys all know you are all right we got a new name for the segment here it's orange

01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:35.720
lounge radio featuring Dan making gamers look bad I had a friend confide in me that he had

01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:41.620
to call Netflix because he wanted to send back his copy of there will be blood or kill

01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:48.740
bill 2 and he just accidentally put there will be cock yeah it no case it was like it

01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:54.740
was like it was like boner bros 12 return of the skater teens or whatever and he's like

01:58:54.740 --> 01:59:00.820
I Netflix hello there's a movie on the way to you and their little return cardboard night

01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:05.100
I have the movie here I sent you the wrong thing and they're like oh this happens all

01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:11.120
the time we'll send it back how do you make that mistake like I would imagine the pictures

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:19.640
a lot different between you know what what movie was it do you remember it was as far

01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:25.540
as a porn as far as porn names go it was not a tasteful one I'll put it that way I'm not

01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:29.340
the porn like the actual Netflix movie let's just there's a big difference between like

01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:37.220
sense and sensibility and sniffing balls like big difference between what those DVDs probably

01:59:37.220 --> 01:59:43.340
look like you know yeah and he was worried that there that the disc web whatever it at

01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:50.200
Netflix Netflix is all automated so it would have sent that on to the next person in their

01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:54.860
queue and they would have ended up on a local news so he did his due diligence and called

01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:58.980
and said there's porn on the way to you but yeah this yeah this stuff happens all the

01:59:58.980 --> 02:00:05.080
time doesn't surprise me and I imagine the person who bought the sonic game at full retail

02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:09.100
you know was up late at night and like this game is terrible so he took the instruction

02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:13.320
booklet he's like here's what I think of this game he just threw a big dick this game is

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:22.500
cock and then he put it away that's why what happened fantastic we need to go back to a

02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:29.380
time when gaming was much simpler and easier back before people were drawing penises and

02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:33.340
instruction manual I just kidding people have always been drawing penises and instruction

02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:37.580
manuals right it's a classic game of the week every week here on the program Dark Sakura

02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:40.500
takes a trip into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks you all should

02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:45.660
be playing this week but she's not here so not this week so this week Salacious Pop is

02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:50.140
going to take a trip into Dark Sakura's gaming vault and pull out a game that he thinks you

02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:55.460
all should be playing this week Salacious Pop what is the classic game of the week I'm

02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:59.940
finally giving up the whole Sierra Online classic PC thing I've sort of written that

02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:07.100
into the ground so I'm taking it to Lagoon on the Super Nintendo all right let's hear

02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:17.140
some music from Lagoon so Lagoon got its notoriety because it was a RPG that came out

02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:23.260
near the beginning of the console's life obviously those of us that remember when this Super

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:29.680
Nintendo launched there was Final Fantasy 2 or 4 that was a launch title the really

02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:35.180
big heavy hitter RPGs like Chrono Trigger Final Fantasy 3 didn't come until much later

02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:39.260
in this in the SNES's life cycle. Final Fantasy 2 wasn't technically a launch title but it

02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:43.380
would be that launch window it was it was the Christmas that turn that Nintendo loves

02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:49.080
launch window yeah so Lagoon came out within a year or a year and a half when there wasn't

02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:55.780
really much in the way of RPGs to play after you've beaten Final Fantasy Lagoon was a top

02:01:55.780 --> 02:02:06.020
down sort of think like Zelda style game it was a pretty unabashed Wanderers of Ys clone

02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:09.900
before there was a Zelda game on the Super Nintendo it's important to say because Link

02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:14.580
to the Past didn't come out till that was like the next Christmas or the Christmas after

02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:19.500
and the Ys games which I think came out on the TurboGrafx-16 wasn't a system that most

02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:27.180
people owned really so Lagoon is pretty much a clone as it's sort of like Secret of Mana

02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:34.340
that style of action RPG I played this game I didn't actually beat it I borrowed it from

02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:39.260
a friend and I played it for about a week and had to give it up give it back but uh

02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:46.140
yeah the plot is that you live in Wakeland which is a very lush beautiful world of you

02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:53.300
know water and everything and this evil wizard has been poisoning the water by the underground

02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:58.020
castle of Lagoon which is where all of the magical water comes from he poisoned it because

02:02:58.020 --> 02:03:04.140
he wants to raise a big bad demon very cookie cutter JRPG plot line I remember this game

02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:07.660
very vividly I love this game too in fact I want to do this classic game at some point

02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:14.360
but it's very Zelda-esque and uh so yeah so you of course are raised to be the champion

02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:18.460
of light for no reason you're just raised to be this hero that's been prophesized you

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:23.180
know so don't ask questions about the story this is Super NES RPG you are the hero of

02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:28.300
light and so yeah so the water's been poisoned the evil wizard has taken the castle of Lagoon

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:31.940
out of from the bottom of the sea and he's made it float up into the sky you have to

02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:37.060
go eventually go from village to village and level up and beat dungeons and get treasure

02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:44.500
and eventually you go up to the final dungeon the castle and the opening sort of has a sort

02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:51.300
of anime intro or as much as you could do on the Super Nintendo and for those of us

02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:56.260
that are familiar with YIS the art style they have like the big anime bright eyes that were

02:03:56.260 --> 02:04:01.500
that was in Wanderers of YIS so that's kind of how the art direction was a bit just a

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:09.940
competent RPG not really groundbreaking it was kind of buggy a lot the boss battles were

02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:14.160
actually pretty hard if you didn't know how to avoid the little bullets that they would

02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:19.980
shoot at you so it was difficult until you figured it out this game also came out on

02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:26.260
the Sharp X68000 which was a Sharp PC home computer product that was released only in

02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:30.100
Japan I was saying nobody had that here yeah that only came out in Japan I think it kind

02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:36.580
of bombed there it only had a life cycle of a couple years but this was a game that came

02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:41.660
out for that esoteric system so I'm sure that Dark Sakura would like that it was published

02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:51.060
by Kemco who also put out a lot of the Warner Brothers Bugs Bunny and Snoopy games I believe

02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:54.980
they also did the Drakken games Drakken and Dragons view yeah and that was one of the

02:04:54.980 --> 02:05:03.740
also another Super NES RPG where it was kind of your option if you were an RPG freak like

02:05:03.740 --> 02:05:07.740
me your options were limited I had Drakken my parents bought me Drakken when I got a

02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:11.860
Super Nintendo for that Christmas I got Super Mario World because it comes with it and Drakken

02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:15.860
because that was the game that the Sears person told them to buy or Montgomery Ward or wherever

02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:21.780
they bought my Super Nintendo so yeah so Lagoon if you've never played it it's a competent

02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:28.620
top-down action RPG that a lot of you know gamers my age ended up playing just because

02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:35.220
you know any port in a storm and it wasn't terrible by any means one additional audio

02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:41.380
clip that I wanted to have you play is when you kill the boss you know you just hack and

02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:47.780
add in a dies it had this this sort of shriek that played when you killed the boss and every

02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:52.300
boss whether it was a robot or a dinosaur made the same noise let's play it and see

02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:57.460
if we can recognize what wave file this is so here goes the boss but you always skip

02:05:57.460 --> 02:06:05.100
ahead a little bit to the actual path here yeah here we go he's exploiting this first

02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:15.140
boss by finding a spot in the back of the room here we go sounds like an elephant it

02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:20.780
is it is the wholesome stage elephant sound industry from Street Fighter 2 whether that

02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:25.580
came first in Lagoon copied it or probably what happened this actually happens quite

02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:29.940
a bit in the gaming industry where there's these public domain sound clip files that

02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:35.100
you will find sometimes like you know how even public domain just like sound like archives

02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:39.220
that they buy so it's like usually there's little samples of like yeah boy or things

02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:42.900
like that that you hear like in a DDR song that then you'll hear later in a game somewhere

02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:50.540
else and it's really weird like I want to say one of the big DR songs you hear the samples

02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:57.460
somewhere else it's really weird Max 300 the fire that whole thing like those those clips

02:06:57.460 --> 02:07:02.380
you hear those elsewhere so anyway yes I just thought it was funny that I didn't put this

02:07:02.380 --> 02:07:06.900
together at the time but you have the boss noise when you kill a boss is the elephant

02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:13.700
cry and awesome stage Street Fighter 2 nice but the the dungeons in this you know had

02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:17.500
some pretty clever map design more clever than it probably had any right to you know

02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:22.780
you could get lost but it was a it was a pretty fast paced game you didn't really have to

02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:28.300
grind too much you just hit from town to dungeon and there was always something to do so all

02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:35.540
right good pick classic game of the week everybody Lagoon from Kemko Seika for the Super Nintendo

02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:40.340
although technically it was also released on the x8600 was the name of the sharp sharp

02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:44.940
computer yeah over in Japan and there it is your classic game of the week good job Dark

02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:48.340
Sakura would be very proud did you did you screen your pick with her in advance I know

02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:52.140
she she knew you were gonna do it but she know what game you're picking no I think she'll

02:07:52.140 --> 02:07:56.900
like it she'll approve all right we're gonna take a quick break here though guys um gosh

02:07:56.900 --> 02:08:00.740
I thought it was gonna be a show short tonight part a has been two hours and eight minutes

02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:04.600
it's like the longest part a I think I've seen in a long time so good thing it's a three

02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:08.620
day weekend how we got plenty more show to come including your calls some news about

02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:13.460
resistance persona for a Super Mario Brothers and portal crossover game that's gonna be

02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:18.380
very interesting and your tweets at twitter.com slash olr as well as your emails at mailbag

02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:28.940
orange laundry calm when we come back after this break with more of orange lounge radio

02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:34.100
welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio we are live here on this Sunday evening September

02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:42.380
4th of 2011 Labor Day weekend with the 426th episode of our program we're gonna we're running

02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:46.780
long to a little long tonight part a was about two hours I don't think part b will be quite

02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:51.420
as long and we had a late start life tonight too which I know doesn't affect the podcast

02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:55.700
ease but good thing it's a three day weekend let's just put it that way we don't have to

02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:59.380
get up early for work tomorrow during the break I had walked out in the living room

02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:03.580
and I watched Dan was watching some playthroughs on YouTube which I thought was kind of neat

02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:09.380
he was watching a Zelda link to the past which is a classic from the Super Nintendo days

02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:13.100
we need to really have a retro night back at the house salacious pop and play something

02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:18.540
retro and play through like I always kind of thought like I don't want to say it's weird

02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:22.080
to like watch playthroughs because I get the allure of that you know like who doesn't like

02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:26.140
to sit and watch someone else play a video game and the Internet's made that very interesting

02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:29.340
where you can kind of do all that through YouTube and so forth but I don't know I like

02:09:29.340 --> 02:09:33.340
to kind of get my hands on and play and all that stuff and so I kind of want to do a play

02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:37.740
through Super Metroid or something retro I'd love to record a let's play and put on YouTube

02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:42.580
but I do not have the attention span you don't have the attention to that you too this was

02:09:42.580 --> 02:09:50.420
a short game 30 hours of let's play of Tetris you know I did a four block we're done we

02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:53.960
could do a let's play you want to do a let's play we'll do that someday it'd be fun pick

02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:57.340
a game that's only a couple hours we could do Metroid one I could be Metroid one and

02:09:57.340 --> 02:10:02.660
about if I kind of remind what I'd have to do is I have to play through it the day before

02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:06.240
and then I could do a play through the night of and once I kind of remember where everything's

02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:09.860
at least one of those things you never forget but like you kind of want to play it one time

02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:13.500
refresh your memory I could probably play through it in a couple hours once I just kind

02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:18.260
of remember where everything's at you know that amnesia game that's big on steam oh god

02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:22.700
where if you if you are in pitch blackness you go crazy and there's the scary monster

02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:28.380
that you have to hide from it the let's play of though of that of that game are hilarious

02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:33.580
because there are people that are just like in tears hiding in the closet scary it's a

02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:37.420
scary it's a scary and the for the people that record commentary of that what they're

02:10:37.420 --> 02:10:42.660
doing in the game amnesia let's plays look for the one on YouTube that has a couple hundred

02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:48.100
thousand hits and you will laugh because this poor man he's he thinks that he's really dying

02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:52.780
in real life he's very scared I need to find some sound clips from some of those and play

02:10:52.780 --> 02:10:56.440
them on the show I bet they're hilarious they're like the reaction videos to two two girls

02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:05.620
one cup right something like that all right let's move on with some rapid fire news and

02:11:05.620 --> 02:11:10.740
we'll start off with Loki can I give us some quick news yes there's some rumors I mean

02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:14.380
this is kind of a given that there will be like an epic Mickey tube something did pretty

02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:19.320
well but coming from a really I thought it didn't do too well from what I heard it pretty

02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:25.860
well for a Wii game all right of course there there's some surveys going around asking people

02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:32.460
what their preferred packaging for epic Mickey to would be and a little bit because some

02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:39.500
details are kind of derived based on that apparently epic Mickey to will feature Oswald

02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:47.380
the lucky rabbit as well it almost looks like as another playable character and you know

02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:51.540
looks like it that they may do some sort of split screen with that as well and it looks

02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:59.100
like that Oswald can use his ears is kind of like a helicopter no real word of course

02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:06.100
you know one I'm sure this is maybe like a 2012 holiday game if it's being worked on

02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:14.220
right now but they're probably not happy that this leaked if it is holiday 2012 yes so yeah

02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:17.300
I mean it's definitely something that they're working on could it be something where they're

02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:20.900
just gauging interest and it may not actually be being made at all or do you think something

02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:25.300
like this happens I mean because games aren't developed overnight so maybe this one of those

02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:29.740
things where the games are ready in development it's like you know I don't know about that

02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:33.820
I would think they're actually working on it says like the the screenshot that they

02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:38.940
have is now we would like to show you a few more packages for Disney's epic Mickey to

02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:43.900
video game please indicate which package design makes you most interested in purchasing Disney

02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:50.060
epic Mickey to I think the third one is the best out of those I agree with you yes which

02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:54.660
is just the two guys kind of it's not really an action shot everything else is an action

02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:58.740
shot and that except that second one where they're kind of jumping off into the two you

02:12:58.740 --> 02:13:02.900
can't really see their faces which is a little weird to me yeah I don't like the best shot

02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:10.260
third one's pretty good yeah here we are taking the survey all right what else this is kind

02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:15.740
of cool apparently cat or was it mad cats has announced that they're going to be doing

02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:21.660
some official licensed major league gaming controllers now normally if it were the case

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:26.540
of you know the major league gaming I wouldn't give a shit about it and their fight stick

02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:30.360
it's expensive it just looks like one of the normal mad cats fight sticks that they put

02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:34.820
out for you know a street fighter or something like that that's fine but what makes me interested

02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:39.900
though is actually their controller the controller that they've got out yes it's wired but it's

02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:43.620
got a neat bunch of neat features like for example you're able to swap out the analog

02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:50.500
sticks if you want and you can swap them between basically the playstation 3 and the xbox 360

02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:57.300
ones also you'll be able to swap out the d-pad and you can put in either playstation 3 or

02:13:57.300 --> 02:14:02.940
you know the 360 d-pad that is awesome whoa whoa whoa whoa so I could have playstation

02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:14.420
3 controls on my 360 yes style controls I'm just I'm a little bit flabbergasted I'm partially

02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:19.700
kind of like why haven't we seen this before like the 360 would be great if it had the

02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:25.140
playstation 3's controller yeah and it also includes placement so like for example you

02:14:25.140 --> 02:14:30.760
could put you know the analog sticks you can move them around or whatever if you want really

02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:35.580
Dan's saying they used to make a controller like that I just don't even remember old school

02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:39.900
playstation era no prices have been announced yet but these controllers include the base

02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:45.900
controller two pro module d-pads one that's you know like the xbox 360 one that's like

02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:51.380
the playstation 3 for analog sticks you know two that are like the 360 to they're like

02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:58.620
the ps3 two faceplates a matte finish or glossy finish a braided three meter cable that actually

02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:02.960
screws onto the controller integrated weight compartment so you can adjust the weights

02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:08.440
on there it's getting more expensive and pro case that the whole thing is stored in plus

02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:14.420
they're saying that they're gonna be able to sell additional add-ons later on like customize

02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:20.860
you know analog how much they haven't said I do know that the fight stick is like 150

02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:28.120
bucks so I would hope that this is around the same price as a regular controller although

02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:33.140
I'd imagine it's probably around like 70 80 bucks yeah I was gonna say that looks 69.99

02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:39.060
right there that's not bad if it's 69.99 because regular controllers are 60 bucks so 10 bucks

02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:44.400
extra yeah that might be worth it yeah I'm uh yeah yeah and dark tattoo is in our chat

02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:50.140
room see saying see I thought Rob might like this considering the 360s d-pad is ass exactly

02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:58.100
I I do like this actually interesting all right all right and then last but not least

02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:03.620
dance central to the announced some tracks for that and actually some of these are pretty

02:16:03.620 --> 02:16:10.660
awesome they had a way what is love oh my god yes it's awesome that by the that's that

02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:14.140
song from the club guys the Saturday night live the night at the Roxbury that's what's

02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:21.980
called digital underground with the Humpty dance sir mix allowed baby got back the mix

02:16:21.980 --> 02:16:30.080
mix not really sure what that is Bobby about my prerogative Curtis blow the brakes and

02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:36.580
a sure featuring little John and ludicrous yeah so not bad it's got a pretty kick-ass

02:16:36.580 --> 02:16:41.060
song list so far definitely interested in this game no surprise there had a way was

02:16:41.060 --> 02:16:45.520
love that's gonna be easiest routine ever can't wait just pop your head back and forth

02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:50.080
that had if that's not in there this whole this whole game is a sham and I'm gonna write

02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:53.980
harmonics and tell them so they've got a head no head bobbing and what is love your game

02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:59.260
is they've got to have that at least in part of it I mean come on you gotta that it's only

02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:04.340
that song famous it wasn't the song itself right right all right well I got some news

02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:09.140
for you guys it starts off with news on Zelda Skyward Sword there's going to be a $70 bundle

02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:12.860
that comes I'm sorry to interrupt you real quick go ahead I was gonna say they do member

02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:16.420
have that mode or maybe doesn't just answer you but where you can create your own routine

02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:21.820
so maybe I don't think that was in dance I don't think it's just dance damn it all right

02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:27.060
there's going to be a $70 Zelda Skyward Sword bundle and it comes with the Wii remote plus

02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:32.060
it's a gold one that's good for those that never did buy a Wii remote plus including

02:17:32.060 --> 02:17:35.500
myself I never bothered with the attachment or anything but this is one of those like

02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:40.380
all-in-one Wii controllers so IDK I might have to pick this up I'm not sure yet I'm

02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:44.540
still not kind of sure how I feel about Zelda Skyward Sword but you do you have to have

02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:49.180
the Wii motion plus you really should get one of those I don't know if I'd spend the

02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:54.340
extra money well it's not bad I mean the controller itself is gonna be what 40 so I might as well

02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:58.420
get the game I just bought Wii motion pluses so you know a big deal my controllers a little

02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:04.060
longer now just so you know it also comes with a CD from the Zelda 25th anniversary

02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:09.380
concert this all comes out on November 20th they are saying that the initial print of

02:18:09.380 --> 02:18:14.860
both the Wii controller and just the regular game by itself will have the CD that's pretty

02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:20.620
cool and the gold the gold wiimotes kind of neat I guess if you're into color collecting

02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:25.060
burnout crash coming out of Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and the date has been

02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:30.260
set September 20th and that'll set you back either 800 Microsoft points which is 10 bucks

02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:36.900
or $9.99 on PlayStation Network so you can save a whole penny radiant silver gun is coming

02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:42.220
to Xbox Live Arcade and it's been dated for September 14th 1200 Microsoft points that's

02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:47.100
15 bucks no word on a PlayStation Network version but yeah it's it's not just a port

02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:51.760
I believe this is like a little remake it's gonna have an online two-player co-op Saturn

02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:58.900
and arcade style game variants different graphical modes an Ikaruga scoring system it's gonna

02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:04.820
say that was a big Saturn game when the Saturn tried to you know survive here and I think

02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:09.500
that's a former or previous class game of the week oh I'm sure I'm sure Jamie probably

02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:13.860
has highlighted every treasure made game at some point so radiant silver gun on Xbox Live

02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:20.020
Arcade I know anybody who's a fan of shooters at all has got to be at least a little curious

02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:25.980
about this if not just downright excited so all right let's move on slice pop professor

02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:33.340
Layton for we're getting it we're getting it soon we're getting it in October it is

02:19:33.340 --> 02:19:39.480
called professor Layton and the last specter it is the fourth game in the series it was

02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:44.620
just announced that we're getting it on the 3ds even though it's not technically a 3ds

02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:51.380
game on October 17th and it's at the Japanese version of the game came out with a little

02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:56.580
sort of Gaiden side story thing within this within the same cartridge called professor

02:19:56.580 --> 02:20:01.460
Layton's London life RPG we are getting that as well translated so we're getting the bonus

02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:13.940
game along with the proper sequel this October and also in a quickfire news we have a bundle

02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:22.020
coming out for the Kinect which is going to come with child of Eden and the price point

02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:27.360
is going to be $150 I'm not sure if that's how much how much is the Kinect right now

02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:37.300
by itself retail 100 150 Loki do you know off the top of your head is it 150 150 yeah

02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:46.900
yeah and so yeah that is coming see when the story is I think it's September 20 if I remember

02:20:46.900 --> 02:20:51.540
correctly yeah I'm not seeing a date on this story going out of me but yeah if you loved

02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:58.380
rez which is an amazing music and special effects game child of Eden it believe it or

02:20:58.380 --> 02:21:04.980
not is easier to play with a controller but seeing how so yeah seeing how the Kinect interface

02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:09.780
interfaces with the game is neat but yeah so the Kinect is getting the bundle game child

02:21:09.780 --> 02:21:14.900
of Eden soon I talked about this when I first reviewed child of Eden but I honestly think

02:21:14.900 --> 02:21:22.140
it's going to be better on the move but that's just me yeah and finally let's see if I can

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:30.980
pronounce this right d3 is coming out with new Oni Chimbara Oni Chimbara thank you game

02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:39.100
basically you are bikini clad Japanese school girls it looks like it's kind of a like a

02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:45.380
bastard on Dreamcast or Devil May Cry slasher game very gory you're basically bikini school

02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:51.060
girls killing zombies and when you kill a zombie blood everywhere blood splash oh god

02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:58.900
so much blood bikini and a cowboy hat yep and where it's an Xbox exclusive game coming

02:21:58.900 --> 02:22:06.220
out in Japan this winter so yeah Oni Chimbara 2 and we don't have part one here in the States

02:22:06.220 --> 02:22:11.300
but it sounds like something we do yeah oh yeah so if it comes out over there then maybe

02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:16.980
we'll get the sequel here and babes killing zombies what's not to love and they're the

02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:19.980
first game is kind of lame but the second one looks a little bit better because it's

02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:23.540
not just zombies you're fighting it's like actual monsters and stuff so it looks a little

02:22:23.540 --> 02:22:31.260
bit like a little bit like bullet which but not quite as cool all right I want to throw

02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:36.540
one more plug for the upcoming indie segment here on the show I'm was finally go figure

02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:39.380
the week we're not here I'm finally getting some bites on this so I think we're ready

02:22:39.380 --> 02:22:43.900
to roll this out next week but I do want to say one more time before we roll out the segment

02:22:43.900 --> 02:22:48.140
if you have an indie game if you're developing one or you know people who are and they could

02:22:48.140 --> 02:22:52.940
be for a PC it could be for Xbox Live any arcade it could be iOS I don't really care

02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:57.060
as long as you're independent we want to feature more independent games here on the show after

02:22:57.060 --> 02:23:01.460
all we are an independent podcast so reach me at rob at orange laundry.com or of course

02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:04.980
you know I send it to the general mailbag as well mailbag at orange laundry.com or use

02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:09.180
the contact us forum on the site I don't really care just get in touch with us if you think

02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:13.300
your game is worthy of being highlighted on the show in a new segment that I really hope

02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:18.020
will start next week because I did get several interested people like it's when it rains

02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:21.780
it pours right I wasn't getting anything for a couple weeks and a lot last week so I'm

02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:28.140
really excited so we'll be getting into that very soon also one more plug for tweets tonight

02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:35.020
twitter.com slash o l r we'll be getting to those shortly but first couple more stories

02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:40.260
according to Howard Stringer he is saying that the PlayStation Network is bouncing back

02:23:40.260 --> 02:23:48.900
way Howard Stern the stock shock jock DJ Stringer Oh Stringer not Stern he is basically saying

02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:53.380
the PlayStation Network is more secure and better than ever and added that the company

02:23:53.380 --> 02:23:58.460
is working to expand the service which has added three million new customers since the

02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:10.740
attack and sales have actually increased relative to the pre-attack levels so interesting told

02:24:10.740 --> 02:24:20.260
you people would forget about it in a few months yeah well that's very not surprising

02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:24.900
that everybody's going to forgive and forget after a few months except maybe those people

02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:31.180
who sold back their systems in a fit I don't know but I you know what I honestly think

02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:35.180
might be happening I think people stole all the Sony information has been using it to

02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:40.020
hack the Xboxes like I think that's why the Xbox like I could swear I had different passwords

02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:44.940
on 360 and PlayStation Network but now I'm thinking maybe I didn't and maybe that's how

02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:53.060
my Xbox was hacked I don't know but just interesting so all right anyhow story for you guys about

02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:56.420
something that was announced at E3 this year that had a lot of people very excited it was

02:24:56.420 --> 02:25:01.660
the PlayStation 3D display bundle yes remember when they were going to be selling the monitor

02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:06.420
with resistance 3 for $4.99 but then when they were like actually we're not gonna put

02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:10.460
resistance 3 in there we're gonna put a motor storm apocalypse in there and some retailers

02:25:10.460 --> 02:25:14.140
were like well fuck you we're gonna be of resistance 3 anyway so that way they pre-order

02:25:14.140 --> 02:25:21.500
with us well actually this is interesting Sony has apparently made this their plan the

02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:28.340
whole time resistance 3 is going to be included with any 3d display that was pre-ordered before

02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:35.280
September 30th motor storm though will be included no matter what so that's why Walmart

02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:39.780
Amazon and GameStop were putting out all these deals I guess the whole time Sony was like

02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:44.780
yeah you can offer this deal and so it was to look like a pre-order I don't know is it

02:25:44.780 --> 02:25:49.100
a brilliant marketing scheme or do you feel a little used or and who cares it's just a

02:25:49.100 --> 02:25:55.660
TV I don't think it's selling as well as they'd hoped really well come on it's a $499 piece

02:25:55.660 --> 02:26:01.340
of yeah but it's 3d and it comes with two games it's 24 inch it's not that bad that's

02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:05.500
perfect for like a dorm room I would love yes in college for a dorm room but then you

02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:11.620
gotta buy another pair of glasses if you wanna you know it it's expensive and there's a small

02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:17.020
part of me that's interested but then I go but if I kick down like another $300 I could

02:26:17.020 --> 02:26:20.120
just get like a large 3d they're just trying to they're just trying to get you to buy now

02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:23.620
but then you wait wait just a little longer and you can get like you're gonna be able

02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:31.940
to get a you know full-size HDTV that supports 3d you know for less money and think of how

02:26:31.940 --> 02:26:36.020
fast the technology is evolving I mean right now they have they're trying to sell us on

02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:39.820
these active shutter glasses which I've used them and they gave you a headache and they

02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:44.940
don't have Sony TV too but just wait until they've come out with some technology where

02:26:44.940 --> 02:26:48.540
well they already have it out but you know where it becomes more mainstream where it's

02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:55.060
either the non shutter glasses because each one of those is fucking $70 $70 for a pair

02:26:55.060 --> 02:26:59.780
of glasses wow when you can you know I hope they got that the technology that they use

02:26:59.780 --> 02:27:06.540
for you know the Disney stuff or whatever and in theaters with those cheap ass $5 glasses

02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:12.660
you know that's what needs to become mainstream yeah so I can't steal a pair of glasses from

02:27:12.660 --> 02:27:16.500
the theaters and use them on these TVs oh yeah cuz no they're active shutter no but

02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:23.220
it's not what the fucking like Sega Master System used that's what all the old 3d systems

02:27:23.220 --> 02:27:30.720
used it was active shutter technology you know even way back to the Vectrex was active

02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:39.580
shutter you know the old school 3d stuff in IMAX was active shutter stuff but what they

02:27:39.580 --> 02:27:44.900
need if they just you know really adopt that format with those cheaper glasses I think

02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:48.900
that'd be the way to go because then it's not a big deal to get I think people will

02:27:48.900 --> 02:27:51.460
be more interested in that it's like okay I only have to drop money on this it's like

02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:56.180
well if I want to watch 3d my family I've got to drop you know another I had to buy

02:27:56.180 --> 02:28:04.100
another four pairs of glasses and there's another $300 hmm I don't know slices pop what

02:28:04.100 --> 02:28:09.900
do you think about these TVs do you think this is something I should get for the house

02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:14.340
knowing us we'll just save up and go to fries and get the real the real deal we don't need

02:28:14.340 --> 02:28:17.900
the TV we don't need the starter kit I guess that's true that's kind of where I'm at with

02:28:17.900 --> 02:28:23.680
this so all right for college kids I guess if you're in college did you need a 3d TV

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:27.940
that will fit in a door I need a 3d TV in my dorm room amongst all the college expenses

02:28:27.940 --> 02:28:32.300
well hey you know what my Super Nintendo and it wasn't that wasn't even the cutting edge

02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:37.060
thing Nintendo's the the kids upstairs had a Nintendo 64 and they were like the most

02:28:37.060 --> 02:28:41.340
popular kids in the dorm but I was probably second popular with my Mario Kart nights in

02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:45.660
the dorm room yeah and Duke Nukem 3d I mean just wait I mean if they're putting out if

02:28:45.660 --> 02:28:51.900
Sony is able to put out a monitor for $499 and Sony I mean they're known for being pretty

02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:57.220
high and as far as price points go on their products just wait there's gonna be they're

02:28:57.220 --> 02:29:02.540
gonna be able to do that I just the right now people aren't putting out 3d TVs that

02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:07.580
are 24 inches because who the fuck's gonna buy that I mean if you're gonna buy an HD

02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:11.620
TV and have a 3d it's gonna be something that's being you know used in your living room you're

02:29:11.620 --> 02:29:16.780
gonna want it to be pretty big so if there's a demand for it people put it out and they'll

02:29:16.780 --> 02:29:21.460
put it out cheaper and it'll be better technology so just wait you don't need to jump in the

02:29:21.460 --> 02:29:27.300
3d right away all right let's visit the mailbag and see what you guys think after all we are

02:29:27.300 --> 02:29:31.340
the show where every gamer has a voice I'd like to share your voices not just through

02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:35.020
chat but through email and Twitter and so forth mailbag at orangelandtrader.com this

02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:40.420
place you can send us emails to get your longer thoughts out more than 140 characters and

02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:44.340
salacious pop sitting in for trying to fill Jamie's shoes tonight it's gonna go ahead

02:29:44.340 --> 02:29:52.220
and take over the mailbag okay our first email tonight is from Oscar and he writes I wasn't

02:29:52.220 --> 02:29:59.020
drunk Oscar I swear haha hi guys hugs I miss you all and it's been a while since I wrote

02:29:59.020 --> 02:30:03.940
in so here goes first off as you saw on Twitter I was in Disney World for a week and just

02:30:03.940 --> 02:30:08.860
returned on Monday the 22nd I remember Rob mentioning something about electronica in

02:30:08.860 --> 02:30:14.420
Disneyland and being the huge fan that I am of Tron legacy I was looking forward to seeing

02:30:14.420 --> 02:30:19.180
something like that at Disney World it turns out that there was nothing Tron related there

02:30:19.180 --> 02:30:23.660
other than some blu-ray discs of the movie on some store shelves what exactly did I miss

02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:29.540
out on Tron was on the monorail for a short time but nothing but a painting really Disney

02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:34.260
World they didn't do anything for Tron there it's true also I've always wondered why there

02:30:34.260 --> 02:30:39.980
isn't a Kingdom Hearts attraction at any of the parks probably because it's I'm wondering

02:30:39.980 --> 02:30:45.060
that too that's a brilliant question I it's like Disney refuses to acknowledge it maybe

02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:50.540
because it's a more square you probably have to share the characters money royalties with

02:30:50.540 --> 02:30:56.180
square well first off I think funny that he brought up electronica it makes me feel justified

02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:59.540
for the 10-minute tangent in part a but I think we kind of covered it in part a so I

02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:02.660
don't think I need to elaborate further but as far as Kingdom Hearts I will tell you the

02:31:02.660 --> 02:31:08.900
one thing one thing do two things I've ever seen Kingdom Hearts related in the park once

02:31:08.900 --> 02:31:13.700
I was a store called off the page in California adventure and now I go there every time because

02:31:13.700 --> 02:31:17.940
when I was there once I saw a Sora figurine and it was one of those like nice ceramic

02:31:17.940 --> 02:31:21.620
figurines going for like a hundred bucks like it was that type of quality like a ceramic

02:31:21.620 --> 02:31:26.060
doll and I really wish I bought it and I regret not buying it and that's the only thing

02:31:26.060 --> 02:31:31.020
Kingdom Hearts related I've ever seen in the park besides number two some parents drop

02:31:31.020 --> 02:31:35.420
brought their little kid once dressed to Sora and I saw them standing in line for the haunted

02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:38.500
mansion they were from Australia you know how sometimes little kids want to dress up

02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:41.700
and big kids can't dress up by the way they don't let you in Disneyland you have to be

02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:46.500
like seven or under if you want to wear a costume unless it's Halloween and you're at

02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:51.020
the Halloween party but we saw some Australian parents bring in their like six-year-old in

02:31:51.020 --> 02:31:56.040
a Sora costume and it was adorable and even if you ask a Disney cast member that's working

02:31:56.040 --> 02:32:03.060
at those memorabilia stores that are really into Disney lore they never really heard of

02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:07.420
Kingdom Hearts it's not on the radar for a lot of Disney employees it's a shame. Dark

02:32:07.420 --> 02:32:12.780
Tetsuya says there was a Sora statue in interventions and that I wouldn't you know I don't go in

02:32:12.780 --> 02:32:17.700
interventions a lot I gotta be honest interventions kind of weak and they really need to convert

02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:23.100
the building into something interesting but I wouldn't be surprised that they had a nod

02:32:23.100 --> 02:32:26.460
to Sora in there as well especially because last time I was in there which is a couple

02:32:26.460 --> 02:32:31.840
years ago they had Xbox 360 units that were the exact same things that were on the E3

02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:39.140
show floor earlier that year so you know that's they get some use out of those year-round.

02:32:39.140 --> 02:32:42.420
Does no one else think that a ride of some sort would be pretty awesome again this is

02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:47.540
in regards to Kingdom Hearts or is it just something that Square Enix is holding back

02:32:47.540 --> 02:32:53.460
on for when they launch their own amusement park smirk or sigh I guess my dream shall

02:32:53.460 --> 02:33:00.020
suffice for now. I would assume Disney Sea in Tokyo has more but that's of course a huge

02:33:00.020 --> 02:33:03.460
assumption and I don't really know I would have to rely on a Japanese listener who maybe

02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:07.460
has been there to tell me if Kingdom Hearts has more of a presence there I'm assuming

02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:11.900
but I could be wrong. Secondly while I do think that sending bees to Nintendo would

02:33:11.900 --> 02:33:17.520
be pretty amusing I cannot do so due to me being absolutely terrified of them maybe Operation

02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:22.460
Rainfall members can send bottles of their tears instead. I like that. Was it a campaign

02:33:22.460 --> 02:33:27.260
to send bees to Nintendo? It was on the show a couple weeks ago. And I'm going to end this

02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:32.420
email with one last question regarding 3DS colors. You guys mentioned that the flare

02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:37.300
red 3DS would be coming out in the US in early September. The thing is I'm holding out for

02:33:37.300 --> 02:33:42.220
the release of the purple 3DS that was shown on the floor at E3. That thing looked freaking

02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:48.860
beautiful and he included a link to it and it does it's a gorgeous sexy it's very Prince

02:33:48.860 --> 02:33:55.180
Joker shade of deep purple like yeah it's like the cool purple it's a metallic purple

02:33:55.180 --> 02:34:00.180
not like the like girl it's not let's not lavender it is that's a kid at Chris color

02:34:00.180 --> 02:34:05.340
if I ever saw one I and I didn't you know and I was at E3 that year to have an eggplant

02:34:05.340 --> 02:34:12.020
purple right there eggplant wizard yeah like that I I wish I remembered seeing that because

02:34:12.020 --> 02:34:18.340
that is a sexy 3DS well I may consider getting the flare red system is there any word on

02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:21.940
more colors coming out in the near future no they've announced anything other than the

02:34:21.940 --> 02:34:26.100
flare red one and they're not going to I just wait for them wait their announcement yeah

02:34:26.100 --> 02:34:30.500
wait for that Tokyo event because that could be but that's you know that's probably gonna

02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:38.100
be more Japan but you never know I would still say hold out until after the Tokyo event which

02:34:38.100 --> 02:34:44.500
won't be that long after the flare red DS is out anyway 3DS is out anyway besides you

02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:49.620
probably want to hold out anyways until you know more games come out because they could

02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:53.460
and I hope they don't do it but they could very well even though they've been saying

02:34:53.460 --> 02:34:58.500
Mario Mario 3d land and Mario Kart and be out this year they could very well go up that's

02:34:58.500 --> 02:35:03.980
next year now you watch it could it could well they haven't said anything yet makes

02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:11.460
me wonder thank you as always for reading Oscar so that's the first email next we have

02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:16.540
and I I really don't want to be rude to this person this was written in by Holly Holly

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:23.700
D the first or the two-thirds of the email is basically just a verbatim talking about

02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:30.100
the Deus Ex GameStop removing the code controversy so the first 30 minutes of this show sure

02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:34.900
is really for you Holly sure I'm not going to read it just because it's it's literally

02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:41.060
just saying what happened and how there was a leaked memo and blah blah blah so the commentary

02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:46.680
seriously I've been off GameStop for a while but I still went in and look now and then

02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:51.020
and I still considered buying things from there but coupled with what sky has been saying

02:35:51.020 --> 02:35:56.900
lately in this referring to the code scandal with Deus Ex well this is the final straw

02:35:56.900 --> 02:36:06.180
no more now now it's power gamer Best Buy or online retailers GameStop can stop it yeah

02:36:06.180 --> 02:36:10.500
I mean we kind of talked to death about it the first 30 minutes of the show but I think

02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:15.660
what Holly saying in her email echoes what quite a few people are thinking this week

02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:21.140
it will be interesting I would like to go back and ask these people in a year did you

02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:27.420
stick with it I would ask myself that near to did I stick with it or did I break down

02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:31.340
because GameStop had some stupid exclusive that I had to have I'm trying to think get

02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:36.500
a Skyrim exclusive I'm gonna be so goddamn I don't remember the last time I ever I was

02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:42.580
in a GameStop me neither for anything I think I remember the last game I look when we go

02:36:42.580 --> 02:36:46.780
in the mall I'm not gonna you know I we've gone in the mall and looked but it's more

02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:50.740
of a well what's what's new what's I forget what games are out you know even though I

02:36:50.740 --> 02:36:54.820
do this show sometimes I forget I think the last time I was in there well one times I

02:36:54.820 --> 02:37:02.860
remember was when I was picking up extra copies of episodes from Liberty City just to stock

02:37:02.860 --> 02:37:08.340
the other machines we have but I don't think I don't think I bought a new game from them

02:37:08.340 --> 02:37:15.860
for a long time I don't remember the last thing I bought at one do you I don't remember

02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:20.860
usually when we go in it's to see what they what obscure thing that they have for 360

02:37:20.860 --> 02:37:24.340
or ps3 that's used at a decent price and usually oh that's price too high for a used game and

02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:28.740
we leave mm-hmm I still have a gift card there it's like that same story every time isn't

02:37:28.740 --> 02:37:34.180
it I like their magazine and sometimes we're just fucking bored and you want to go window

02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:38.460
shop you know like even though everything I said about the place is just kind of whatever

02:37:38.460 --> 02:37:42.340
it's here let's just go in and look I'm not gonna buy anything but I'll look and sometimes

02:37:42.340 --> 02:37:47.020
you know and then this goes for a lot of places they may have good deals on like rock band

02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:51.700
equipment or something like that if you need some of that I mean because it's so dirt cheap

02:37:51.700 --> 02:38:02.100
nowadays okay and our final email is from Chiggers this is sent through our comment

02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:08.180
system on the site reading an article recently on IGN entitled what games have taught me

02:38:08.180 --> 02:38:13.580
and it got me thinking about historical facts in games as a way of teaching kids they referred

02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:18.860
to one nest game at North and South which I which I have as an example can you think

02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:23.700
of any other more recent games that have historical facts and whether or not you think it would

02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:28.260
be used more in today's games as a teaching tool I can think of like God a war would be

02:38:28.260 --> 02:38:35.260
good for like mythology I mean well you know it makes a stretch but okay no I won't be

02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:41.540
right we're aware of like you know what different gods were Titans were the pantheon is accurate

02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:46.540
Athena Aries that's all all the edutainment games that I think of that I learned shit

02:38:46.540 --> 02:38:51.120
from is obviously very old and dated I think of Oregon Trail Carmen San Diego number munchers

02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:55.780
absolutely Carmen San Diego math blasters but all that shit's old but at the same time

02:38:55.780 --> 02:39:01.260
actually a lot of that shit is still around like I believe math blasters still exist in

02:39:01.260 --> 02:39:06.720
some form I want to say Oregon trails been working trails been remade now it's a Facebook

02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:12.000
game and kids have that on 3ds right now this year yeah so a lot of those games actually

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:16.240
still exist like they've been updating them forget we just don't follow them because we're

02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:23.060
not six or seven anymore except the occasional retro cool oh lol Oregon Trail on Facebook

02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:27.680
ha ha ha I made slashes pop die of dysentery right like that's that's about the extent

02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:31.520
of it but who really sits down to play an edutainment game I don't think I learned anything

02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:37.980
from Oregon Trail you learned that if you killed 4,000 pounds of Buffalo you can only

02:39:37.980 --> 02:39:44.020
take 10 pounds of it back I learned that that was fun yes you learned where what where where

02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:50.540
did where does the Oregon Trail start yeah independence Missouri and that's why I remember

02:39:50.540 --> 02:39:55.260
that from the game see I learned nothing from the Oregon Trail of course I hope I got that

02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:58.380
right or I'm gonna sound hella stupid I guess I didn't learn anything for the Oregon Trail

02:39:58.380 --> 02:40:05.460
whatsoever it starts in Florida no I'm not I need to click on this IGN article and see

02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:09.380
what what's actually being quoted here but I'll come on you know there's nothing valuable

02:40:09.380 --> 02:40:18.800
there for those that played Bioshock the first one the whole story of rapture the under under

02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:25.220
the sea city was based off of and Rand the fountainhead Atlas shrugged the objectivism

02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:30.460
approach to politics which is some pretty highbrow adult concepts you wouldn't really

02:40:30.460 --> 02:40:36.100
know who and Rand is from playing that game but the antagonist was Andrew Ryan obviously

02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:43.180
a play on her name so that was a game developer saying let's take this whole you know way

02:40:43.180 --> 02:40:47.340
of thinking that a lot of adults you apply to their politics and make a video game based

02:40:47.340 --> 02:40:52.540
on based on it I don't know that that was kind of an intellectual angle for a game did

02:40:52.540 --> 02:40:56.900
you play Bioshock did you pick up on any of that I played a little bit of it but I more

02:40:56.900 --> 02:41:01.460
picked up because I didn't get to that killer twist ending that everybody talks about because

02:41:01.460 --> 02:41:05.700
I'm terrible at first-person shooters I was more like wow this game is really good-looking

02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:10.580
great game yeah I know I know well here's the thing now that you just told me that if

02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:14.520
I wait for Bioshock infinite on PlayStation 3 I can get the first game for free yeah that's

02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:21.420
like in a year it's over a year from now dude just seriously is played is there a skill

02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:25.620
level where like any dope can get through yeah you can play it on easy okay yeah and

02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:29.980
is it like you pray where you never die that's the only reason I could play okay you die

02:41:29.980 --> 02:41:34.700
fucking die but there's respawn points and it's not like you're dead forever I mean all

02:41:34.700 --> 02:41:40.140
right I could do that yeah and steam has had like Bioshock what to on sale for eight bucks

02:41:40.140 --> 02:41:44.540

02:42:57.020 --> 02:42:59.940
want to do that in the future I like that I can't believe I didn't think of that answer

02:42:59.940 --> 02:43:03.820
I just talked about that my freaking week civilization games absolutely you learn about

02:43:03.820 --> 02:43:08.060
some of the great leaders and you know sometimes there sometimes the units that they get that

02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:13.580
are special talk about their culture or kind of something to that culture you know you're

02:43:13.580 --> 02:43:17.900
not going to learn detailed facts but sometimes you're playing scenarios and things like that

02:43:17.900 --> 02:43:22.460
and maybe even that's a great answer maybe some of the World War II like Call of Duty

02:43:22.460 --> 02:43:26.460
games or a battlefield games from you may learn a little bit about history and stuff

02:43:26.460 --> 02:43:36.060
there hmm all right moving on let's talk about the F use of the week oh every week here on

02:43:36.060 --> 02:43:41.340
the program we get angsty why because we can we have a microphone and your attention so

02:43:41.340 --> 02:44:02.380
we're going to rant that's what people do Loki wants to start us off tonight fuck you

02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:07.320
to the mark system for those who are unaware of what the mark system is think of it like

02:44:07.320 --> 02:44:12.860
an enhanced version of the Dewey decimal system or like a bibliography for everything in the

02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:19.860
goddamn world I fucking have to learn that shit this week and it was boring as hell it's

02:44:19.860 --> 02:44:26.160
like libraries are so fucking old school get with the times they have to like it's ridiculous

02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:31.260
all the crap that they break down about each individual thing and mainly I was looking

02:44:31.260 --> 02:44:36.440
for DVDs and games but oh my god is boring and I had to learn the Dewey decimal system

02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:39.580
for a little bit which actually Dewey decimal system isn't as complicated as I thought which

02:44:39.580 --> 02:44:45.100
is great but I still don't care so fuck you though slashes pop do you have any F use the

02:44:45.100 --> 02:44:53.140
week this might be taking from your F use but F you to giant huge spiders that like

02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:58.660
to make webs above our front door so we have to not walk into them he's big I don't want

02:44:58.660 --> 02:45:04.740
to I need to spray acid on him or the pesticide the raid he's a bits of big spider you need

02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:09.420
to open the door spray it and close it real fast no I'm gonna do it from the patio oh

02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:14.100
that's a good idea stun him with Windex follow up with Buck spray afterwards so I did that

02:45:14.100 --> 02:45:19.180
with the fly it it basically knocked the fly out of the air he couldn't fly anymore got

02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:23.060

02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:27.700
on tonight tips on tonight's orange launch radio yeah he hides up in the corner in the

02:45:27.700 --> 02:45:31.260
day then he just parks in the middle of his huge ass web at night and he's like you walk

02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:36.340

02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:49.080
they just ate ate our headsets for fun ass asshole cap just to just teach us a lesson

02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:52.680
yeah and then we're by the way we're leaving again at the end of the month yeah for another

02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:57.060
four or five days I saw you shut the door to the office last night I saw oh I did yeah

02:46:57.060 --> 02:46:59.820

02:46:59.820 --> 02:47:05.580
I left I left my computer on my computer's loud okay I'm see I'm seeding torrents who

02:47:05.580 --> 02:47:12.820
what porn did you get all right moving on going on to my F use funny enough not the

02:47:12.820 --> 02:47:18.860
F use I was thinking of the F you I'm thinking of tonight F you to the fact that this morning

02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:25.620
I was supposed to get up at 9 a.m. but I set my alarm on a weekday alarm on my iPhone the

02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:29.060
same one as my work alarm you know something's just changed the time on the alarm I'm not

02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:32.580
thinking it yeah I was only set for weekdays you're supposed to meet some people for brunch

02:47:32.580 --> 02:47:37.060
at 10 30 we go to gay brunch every Sunday I try to I get a text message at 10 20 we

02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:42.900
have a table it's in the back but the text message woke me up to a off fuck like this

02:47:42.900 --> 02:47:48.340
I think that's what you heard this morning right that's what you woke up to yeah oops

02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:52.940
so if you to myself so yeah we had to flake and say that we are lazy slugs and we we slept

02:47:52.940 --> 02:47:58.180
and I missed brunch the sound of gay man judgment coming through the phone you could just you

02:47:58.180 --> 02:48:08.100
could just feel it you know you know what I'm talking about all right now moving on

02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:13.780
more news stories and then the Twitter and skype line coming up at 1 877 game olr toll-free

02:48:13.780 --> 02:48:24.500
numbers back this week hooray so there's been a new break in the console hacking scene if

02:48:24.500 --> 02:48:31.220
you will apparently there is now a new exploit called the reset glitch hack that allows any

02:48:31.220 --> 02:48:41.220
Xbox 360 any from now before and in the future to be turned into a JTAG console period apparently

02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:48.220
it is an exploit that cannot be patched and people have already found a way to that sounds

02:48:48.220 --> 02:48:53.780
pretty definitive they've run away or found a way to load this program called Zell which

02:48:53.780 --> 02:48:59.220
is kind of like a front end for they don't have any read was like rebooters yet which

02:48:59.220 --> 02:49:04.140
means you can't run a custom firmware on it yet but right now you can launch homebrew

02:49:04.140 --> 02:49:09.460
stuff and they have a video someone actually running a Nintendo 64 emulator on their slim

02:49:09.460 --> 02:49:16.780
and already different people out there and you know the mod scene of already created

02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:22.020
new tools to enable people to do that so it's a matter of time before the JTAG prices drop

02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:31.020
and people will be able to do more crazy homebrew stuff or piracy I guess you know a lot of

02:49:31.020 --> 02:49:35.700
people are using for piracy well at least right now there's no way to take JTAGs online

02:49:35.700 --> 02:49:41.740
without them being banned immediately once people figure a way around that then yeah

02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:52.220
so it's interesting you have a JTAG so it doesn't matter I don't know I'm just I don't

02:49:52.220 --> 02:49:56.660
know like it's it's I talked about this on the last show which is two weeks ago about

02:49:56.660 --> 02:50:00.820
when I talked about how I finally did the Wii because joystick put the instructions

02:50:00.820 --> 02:50:04.260
up that made it look so easy and it's kind of like you know I have to really have a reason

02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:07.940
to do it and now my reason for at least the Wii is being able to play shit that Nintendo

02:50:07.940 --> 02:50:13.180
won't release in this country it's kind of nice so I don't know I don't have a reason

02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:21.060
yet to do that to my 360 but well my 360 I use a lot for editing Grand Theft Auto so

02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:25.380
I use it to test stuff instead of having the burn discs every time it's back in the day

02:50:25.380 --> 02:50:29.940
when I first started doing Grand Theft Auto mods I did have the burn discs every time

02:50:29.940 --> 02:50:35.620
and I had a stack of discs that were just ridiculous so it does save me a lot of money

02:50:35.620 --> 02:50:40.660
in that sense plus you can do mods and trainers and stuff like that on games and it's kind

02:50:40.660 --> 02:50:47.000
of fun alright moving on to a game series that I'm sure a lot of people are very excited

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:50.300
about this is going to be a system seller I'm not even kidding for the PlayStation Vita

02:50:50.300 --> 02:50:57.500
a lot of people are going to be excited about this Persona 4 Persona 4 now this was already

02:50:57.500 --> 02:51:02.260
a PlayStation 2 game but they are going to be actually making a portable port of this

02:51:02.260 --> 02:51:07.140
it's going to be out in Japan in 2012 they're going to be enhancing some things new animation

02:51:07.140 --> 02:51:11.940
one new character new voice acting wireless support where you can call others if you think

02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:16.460
you're about to die in a dungeon and so forth crazy also announced however which is very

02:51:16.460 --> 02:51:23.060
interesting a Persona fighting game it's by Arc System Works you know them Blazblue right

02:51:23.060 --> 02:51:28.660
it's Persona 4 the ultimate in my account my Onaka arena it's going to hit arcades in

02:51:28.660 --> 02:51:33.140
spring of 2012 apparently PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions will come out later in the

02:51:33.140 --> 02:51:40.180
summer so persona fans have a lot to be excited about so yeah I have persona 3 the hella edition

02:51:40.180 --> 02:51:45.060
that came out for the ps2 because it came out twice persona 3 in the second edition

02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:48.660
and then I hear that the PSP port of persona 3 that came out a year or two ago is even

02:51:48.660 --> 02:51:51.900
better than that and aren't those games like I haven't gotten really into a lot of persona

02:51:51.900 --> 02:51:55.660
games aren't they very big on like it's it's kind of like a do whatever you want type of

02:51:55.660 --> 02:52:00.920
RPG isn't it some are a lot of them run on a like a calendar system where you do you

02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:06.240
have a certain amount of time in a day to do something but persona 4 address some pretty

02:52:06.240 --> 02:52:12.060
adult concepts that aren't really that controversial but they are because video games are for kids

02:52:12.060 --> 02:52:17.660
of course that they handled very maturely and I'm glad that that content is there but

02:52:17.660 --> 02:52:21.480
yeah and I have persona 4 for the ps2 I didn't know that collector's edition yet said it's

02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:25.320
on our shelf never touched it now this edition for the vitamin is what may as well wait for

02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:28.500
the new one it's got more shit in it the adult content he's talking about is dick pics of

02:52:28.500 --> 02:52:34.340
course drawn in the instruction manual of course of course tastefully tastefully all

02:52:34.340 --> 02:52:40.220
right anyhow so let's just pop why don't you give us another news story this was pretty

02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:48.620
huge on the internet last week maybe a week before basically a fan YouTube or a flash

02:52:48.620 --> 02:52:56.500
animation of Super Mario Brothers with portal gun because of portal to portal gun is awesome

02:52:56.500 --> 02:53:01.700
everyone watched it on Newgrounds or YouTube and everyone laughed and it was great well

02:53:01.700 --> 02:53:05.660
a student let me play a little clip here in the background so you can hear the noises

02:53:05.660 --> 02:53:14.820
a studio it's a two-man team that calls themselves stab yourself so stab yourself studios oh

02:53:14.820 --> 02:53:18.980
what a pleasant name they are make that's like one of the old-school Nintendo emulators

02:53:18.980 --> 02:53:26.020
remember Nestle and Genesis yeah charming names they are making Mario Super Mario Brothers

02:53:26.020 --> 02:53:31.480
with a portal gun for real they are working on it hopefully valve and I won't shut it

02:53:31.480 --> 02:53:37.380
down but um they have a proof of concept so valve will just hire him yeah okay yeah absolutely

02:53:37.380 --> 02:53:42.800
valve will just hire him to make a Mario clone that has the portal guns in it watch that's

02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:47.060
how valve responds to things and they have sort of an alpha proof of concept YouTube

up and you can see what the game plays like and it looks pretty awesome it's nice it's

02:53:52.060 --> 02:53:59.480
cool of course is it gonna be one of those games you play for five minutes and you're

02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:05.500
like well I know on Newgrounds there was the big um I'm it's Super Mario Brothers but you

02:54:05.500 --> 02:54:09.780
can play it as Samus and Kid Icarus and one of the contra dudes Super Mario crossover

02:54:09.780 --> 02:54:13.740
it reminds me of that yeah it does a little bit but yeah they're saying that they're working

02:54:13.740 --> 02:54:17.300
on it and they've got a YouTube channel up for progress but who knows if this will ever

02:54:45.900 --> 02:54:49.780
ends with a tie I know this isn't I do video games but I gotta say like what wait what

02:54:49.780 --> 02:54:54.740
what shows this Hell's Kitchen it's been the same fucking show for nine years like it really

02:54:54.740 --> 02:55:00.020
has like at least something like Survivor or Big Brother has the different people they

02:55:00.020 --> 02:55:04.020
get into the different conflicts there's different twists and so forth but in Hell's Kitchen

02:55:04.020 --> 02:55:09.740
the twists don't even matter like you I I just turned it on randomly one day I had no

02:55:56.660 --> 02:56:01.020
always a fucking risotto there's always a fucking like chicken there's always a fish

02:56:01.020 --> 02:56:06.140
entree it's always the same goddamn thing just learn how to cook that you're done you're

02:56:06.140 --> 02:56:10.980
set you're gonna have your own fucking restaurant and don't talk back I think you need to go

02:56:10.980 --> 02:56:16.020
on Hell's Kitchen I don't know how to cook although if I did I would learn how to cook

02:56:16.020 --> 02:56:20.100
the risotto and cook all that shit and they way he's like he's all this is what risotto

02:56:20.100 --> 02:56:23.020
supposed to taste like that's right bitch that's right you should have done it this

02:56:23.020 --> 02:56:29.060
way and you just don't call me if you fucking call me a bitch no I wouldn't talk to him

02:56:29.060 --> 02:56:33.740
though I'd talk to the other people that when you piss them off I love the stunt cake shows

02:56:33.740 --> 02:56:38.980
where they have to make this huge SpongeBob SquarePants with like a fucking Ferris wheel

02:56:38.980 --> 02:56:44.500
and like a waterfall you know Food Network challenge or whatever it's always it's always

02:56:44.500 --> 02:56:48.580
a cake once they replace the host and host is terrible and it's it's always awesome when

02:56:48.580 --> 02:56:52.100
because they have to carry it from the kitchen to the judgment table sometimes the whole

02:56:52.100 --> 02:56:56.620
thing was fucking fall over there's $300 a cake on the floor there are two Food Network

02:56:56.620 --> 02:56:59.820
shows I can actually watch one of them is the old-school Iron Chef from Japan which

02:56:59.820 --> 02:57:05.180
I don't even think they show anymore on food TV or it's a the cooking channel now and then

02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:10.060
I watch I can watch Unwrapped with Mark Summers because Mark Summers I was really in a Top

02:57:10.060 --> 02:57:17.660
Chef until I got to replace of it replays are no new shows oh that's a bummer easy thing

02:57:17.660 --> 02:57:24.120
yeah I watched a ton of Food Network a ton of food when I lived with him Nelly would

02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:27.780
come over and they would watch Food Network like that's how I got to watching some of

02:57:27.780 --> 02:57:31.060
these shows because I just be kind of sitting there I go I fucking food looks so fucking

02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:36.740
good oh my god oh my god this shows about oh my god it's an unwrapped on Pringles died

02:57:36.740 --> 02:57:40.940
what to have and watch a lot of Food Network and it's great it's I like watching Chopped

02:57:40.940 --> 02:57:45.140
because it's like a mini Iron Chef it's actually pretty good I like it's pretty cool hosted

02:57:45.140 --> 02:57:50.240
by Ted Allen from your Queer Eye I really wish that shows on TV I love that show it's

02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:58.480
sad it's gone I do I understand so my guilty pleasure shows are makeover shows I love makeover

02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:03.780
shows you know it's not necessarily people makeover Loki is the straight one on the show

02:58:03.780 --> 02:58:10.580
you know not necessarily people makeover shows it's like you know like the car makeover shows

02:58:10.580 --> 02:58:15.180
you know like there's my ride there's a home there's a house makeover show I don't watch

02:58:15.180 --> 02:58:20.140
that but but like they have a restaurant impossible now it's a restaurant makeover show do you

02:58:20.140 --> 02:58:26.460
watch Extreme Makeover no did you watch The Swan no no I don't I don't watch the people

02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:32.220
makeover so I like I like them like building stuff you know like I used to watch Junkyard

02:58:32.220 --> 02:58:36.700
Wars and stuff like that you know stuff where they're taking a pit my rides kind of dumb

02:58:36.700 --> 02:58:41.820
I mean they're like 50 TVs in there it doesn't make any sense but like I like watching them

02:58:41.820 --> 02:58:47.900
you know do stuff to cars and like you remake them and stuff like I used to watch the the

02:58:47.900 --> 02:58:51.980
Jesse James one or whatever monster garage and stuff like that you know those shows are

02:58:51.980 --> 02:58:58.340
awesome yeah and Queer Eye was a good show I liked that show it was it was good you know

02:58:58.340 --> 02:59:02.260
because the people that were on the show like the five guys that they had there were great

02:59:02.260 --> 02:59:05.900
and now they have all their own stuff and Ted Allen's awesome he's one of the best people

02:59:05.900 --> 02:59:11.840
on the show the Blondes on Dancing with the Stars Carson the blonde who was in charge

02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:17.140
of clothes I think he's yeah he's on Dancing with the Stars and people it's so funny because

02:59:17.140 --> 02:59:20.660
people are not even talking about like when Lance Bass a gay guy was on Dancing with the

02:59:20.660 --> 02:59:24.020
Stars you know middle America was all oh my god I can't believe why don't they partner

02:59:24.020 --> 02:59:27.580
you with another man it's so gross it's a family show like people aren't even fucking

02:59:27.580 --> 02:59:31.560
talking about Carson because they totally upped the ante by putting a transgender person

02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:36.140
on this year with Chaz Bono it's like no one no one cur that you're gay because we got

02:59:36.140 --> 02:59:41.860
a transgender and they're oh my god it's ruining Americana and all this bullshit like just

02:59:41.860 --> 02:59:47.120
how are we talking about before I don't remember now I don't know but my point is if Chaz

02:59:47.120 --> 02:59:55.700
Bono wants to dance god damn it let him dance shut the fuck up just because you can't dance

02:59:55.700 --> 02:59:58.620
and they'll have Gordon Ramsay come out and yell at him yes and that'll be that'll bring

02:59:58.620 --> 03:00:02.860
it back to the top story there you go but I do I do hope Asa Case comes back this fall

03:00:02.860 --> 03:00:06.820
because I miss that show the way it ties into video games is there's a fucking DS game for

03:00:06.820 --> 03:00:12.740
every one of these goddamn shows we just mentioned Iron Chef and it was terrible yes I played

03:00:12.740 --> 03:00:16.980
that at PAX one year it was it was better than Cooking Mama yeah but it ended up being

03:00:16.980 --> 03:00:24.020
terrible all right can we move on low key with the gaming news story we can move on

03:00:24.020 --> 03:00:28.580
EA is trying to downplay the whole origin exclusivity of their their titles they're

03:00:28.580 --> 03:00:33.900
basically saying competition and choice go hand in hand so the fact that we only distribute

03:00:33.900 --> 03:00:41.280
our own games on our own platform I don't see that he explained that basically the company

03:00:41.280 --> 03:00:45.780
is in discussions with other publishers that have their games on origin but EA's key focus

03:00:45.780 --> 03:00:51.340
is to develop an oppressive consumer experience where people are happy to play and buy game

03:00:51.340 --> 03:00:55.420
you're just fucking competing with valve okay just stop dancing around it you're trying

03:00:55.420 --> 03:00:59.660
to compete with valve and it's just an awkward situation because you publish valve games

03:00:59.660 --> 03:01:07.460
as well so whatever so battlefield 3 won't be on there oh big big deal you know what

03:01:07.460 --> 03:01:15.740
I don't care you know I heard a story later in the week though about I guess valve games

03:01:15.740 --> 03:01:22.220
are now showing up on origin yeah the PC ones like the actual physical games that EA published

03:01:22.220 --> 03:01:33.700
are showing up on their site but not any digital stuff all right one more story for you guys

03:01:33.700 --> 03:01:38.700
Square Enix is going to be expanding and they're expanding Eidos Montreal they're going to

03:01:38.700 --> 03:01:44.020
be adding 350 employees over the next few years up to 2015 of course they're not saying

03:01:44.020 --> 03:01:48.740
exactly what it is they're developing they haven't really officially announced this either

03:01:48.740 --> 03:01:54.260
but there's a report that's out there from la press affair it's a French name la press

03:01:54.260 --> 03:01:59.700
a a fairies I don't know le press affair that talks about how they're going to double in

03:01:59.700 --> 03:02:03.860
size and accommodate these employees their report says that a tentative agreement was

03:02:03.860 --> 03:02:11.260
made between Eidos Square Enix and all that and investment Quebec that will give them

03:02:11.260 --> 03:02:16.580
tax credits and a 2 million subsidy to square and you know I think this is important to

03:02:16.580 --> 03:02:22.080
point out because with all these news of game studios closing and going under it's nice

03:02:22.080 --> 03:02:28.700
to hear about some expanding isn't it Montreal Eidos I believe is making the fourth thief

03:02:28.700 --> 03:02:33.620
game remember the thief series that's one of the big games they're working on so that's

03:02:33.620 --> 03:02:39.740
pretty cool and of course I'm sure their secret products and all that good stuff so all right

03:02:39.740 --> 03:02:47.780
well that brings us to phone calls so if you want to give us a call you can one eight seven

03:03:31.980 --> 03:03:37.820

03:03:37.820 --> 03:03:41.340
all gonna die because I'm the healer but I just got up off my computer and went to the

other room we're more you know what they say real life greater than Wow what well no not

03:03:48.380 --> 03:03:54.340
always but in this case sure why not all right well what was worth ditching the group to

03:03:54.340 --> 03:04:00.620
talk to us about tonight well first off I'm still really mad about electronica not going

03:04:00.620 --> 03:04:05.300
to be you know up and running when I go to Anaheim in a couple weeks I told well what

03:04:05.300 --> 03:04:10.420
about Oscar what about what about Oscar who emailed us saying that he went to Disney World

03:04:10.420 --> 03:04:14.580
expecting to see a version of it there and he got the shaft he got Tron on blu-ray that's

03:04:14.580 --> 03:04:22.020
what he got well you know that's a good movie so I mean get something out of it I'm gonna

03:04:22.020 --> 03:04:27.700
go there and I'm not gonna get anything because there won't be a store there won't be no I

03:04:27.700 --> 03:04:32.220
said go to D Street the D Street store has like the Tron jackets are all the hats and

03:04:32.220 --> 03:04:36.860
jackets haven't you seen my Tron jacket like didn't you see that you were like oh you haven't

03:04:36.860 --> 03:04:43.620
seen the hat oh you saw the four different jacket my jacket is awesome did you see that

03:04:43.620 --> 03:04:48.740
picture of me on Facebook with the disc and everything forget it no you need to go find

03:04:48.740 --> 03:04:54.500
it but I need the jacket apparently like now there's some awesome yeah there's a windbreaker

03:04:54.500 --> 03:04:58.840
there's a jacket there's a parka there's a but they're really expensive well get a Tron

03:04:58.840 --> 03:05:04.540
parka that's awesome well okay since you were I'm gonna find that picture on Facebook in

03:05:04.540 --> 03:05:09.500
my jacket and while you talk about whatever else you want to talk about tonight oh um

03:05:09.500 --> 03:05:16.100
the other thing is I like origin over steam I've decided so even though a lot of people

03:05:16.100 --> 03:05:21.780
have been slamming origin you are a fan of it why is this I just think it looks cleaner

03:05:21.780 --> 03:05:27.740
um it's easier to navigate in my opinion I've been playing Mass Effect 2 on it it's prettier

03:05:27.740 --> 03:05:38.380
was that I'm it's prettier yes and that's all that matters usually for me so because

03:05:38.380 --> 03:05:44.580
it's prettier and I can navigate it and I don't know I just like it better I wish more

03:05:44.580 --> 03:05:54.060
things were on it like VVVVVVV or a portal loaded through it I'd be cool but no no it's

03:05:54.060 --> 03:05:59.740
not there but I still like it better I sent you a link by the way are you at your computer

03:05:59.740 --> 03:06:05.420
or did you leave no I left oh because I said I sent you my computer I sent you a link to

03:06:05.420 --> 03:06:10.420
that picture of the jacket I don't want to go by my computer I don't want to see me get

03:06:10.420 --> 03:06:17.580
group kids I've never been group kids so do you think okay then do you think people are

03:06:17.580 --> 03:06:22.460
just being unnecessarily rude to origin because of all these stories about how you know they're

03:06:22.460 --> 03:06:28.300
kind of trying to bully their way in with exclusives and making people use it for battlefield

03:06:28.300 --> 03:06:33.620
3 which is gonna be a huge game and all that or is it just like you don't care it's really

03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:39.200
more that you know steam's been around so long everybody loves steam and here's something

03:06:39.200 --> 03:06:43.380
new and nobody wants to try it because it's not steam and so now that they're trying to

03:06:43.380 --> 03:06:48.380
pull well we want to put our own games only on our service that's offensive to these people

03:06:48.380 --> 03:06:55.700
that like steam only I mean it's not like GameStop's freaking platform that sucks because

03:06:55.700 --> 03:07:01.100
it's GameStop and they're terrible it's just EA and they used to be terrible but Activision

03:07:01.100 --> 03:07:07.680
has that title now so we can be okay with EA people need to realize that Microsoft came

03:07:07.680 --> 03:07:12.900
out with their game purchase client game for windows yeah games games for windows which

03:07:12.900 --> 03:07:18.540
was a steam clone and they had exclusives I think it was the only way to buy fable 3

03:07:18.540 --> 03:07:22.160
or fable 2 at the very beginning and no one cared because it was just an ugly application

03:07:22.160 --> 03:07:26.940
that didn't have a library and it had game room making sure that no one cared because

03:07:26.940 --> 03:07:31.980
it was just a fable game so it was overhyped and not worth the money well yeah that and

03:07:31.980 --> 03:07:36.980
even the third-party games that they got licensed to sell on their store the library wasn't

03:07:36.980 --> 03:07:42.660
there so like oh you could buy fable 3 or Arkham Asylum which is a great game but between

03:07:42.660 --> 03:07:48.860
the two I'm not gonna start giving them my money through their you know game platform

03:07:48.860 --> 03:07:54.460
so you think people actually have good games you think you think people need to cut origin

03:07:54.460 --> 03:08:02.060
a break and just check it out already yeah I mean you don't have to get all upset because

03:08:02.060 --> 03:08:06.900
you were going to buy battlefield on steam no well you're not gonna use your steam client

03:08:06.900 --> 03:08:12.500
it's a big deal you'll still get it anyway and origins not that bad like I'll install

03:08:12.500 --> 03:08:17.380
it and check it out white and orange I just don't I don't like having like five different

03:08:17.380 --> 03:08:20.460
stores on my computer I already have the games for windows thing which granted I don't even

03:08:20.460 --> 03:08:24.580
use it well you can delete that I know I can delete that but that's I I have game room

03:08:24.580 --> 03:08:28.340
believe it or not I bought game room stuff for my PC so I kind of have to keep it to

03:08:28.340 --> 03:08:34.540
play that but otherwise you know steam but if origin sells a crazy ass like two dollar

03:08:34.540 --> 03:08:38.780
game sale if they have the state if they have the sales like steam does I will definitely

03:08:38.780 --> 03:08:45.020
I might have to do it yeah I don't want to but I will all right well anything else you

03:08:45.020 --> 03:08:48.940
want to talk about me you can have two things running it's fine I have steam and origin

03:08:48.940 --> 03:08:53.700
running all the time together they're friends all right well is there anything else you

03:08:53.700 --> 03:08:59.180
want to talk about tonight me to talk I'm working on Pokemon right now too so I'm like

03:08:59.180 --> 03:09:05.660
trying to divide my time easily between this phone call Pokemon World of Warcraft hard

03:09:05.660 --> 03:09:15.140
I have a Pokemon question for me Klotov if I were to buy one of these two things and

03:09:15.140 --> 03:09:21.780
it was going because I've never played Pokemon so I'm okay oh my god yeah so leave right

03:09:21.780 --> 03:09:26.220
now the studio and go to what time is it there's something's got to be open that can sell you

03:09:26.220 --> 03:09:35.140
it between either black and white or heart gold and soul silver I have to pick one of

03:09:35.140 --> 03:09:39.180
the one of the two generations and that's going to be my definitive Pokemon experience

03:09:39.180 --> 03:09:43.580
which one do you think I should get black and white black and white black and white

03:09:43.580 --> 03:09:48.980
I think it's amazing like soul silver and heart gold are pretty cool because you can

03:09:48.980 --> 03:09:53.700
get like all the old starters and it's all nostalgic but if you haven't played them before

03:09:53.700 --> 03:10:00.540
you're not gonna get nostalgic for that crap and black and white is just overall better

03:10:00.540 --> 03:10:05.580
made like they actually have the sprites that move it's very annoying playing one of those

03:10:05.580 --> 03:10:10.460
games it's like I do an attack well my guy is frozen but he slightly moves forward because

03:10:10.460 --> 03:10:15.060
he tackled you and it's stupid but at least he's like kind of wobble around and they have

03:10:15.060 --> 03:10:22.140
animations and I felt the story was kind of darker too which is which was neat and plus

03:10:22.140 --> 03:10:26.140
everything that I like comes out download wise is going to be for the newest ones and

03:10:26.140 --> 03:10:33.220
not for the old ones anymore so like you'd be stuck with no cool downloads no special

03:10:33.220 --> 03:10:39.460

03:10:39.460 --> 03:10:44.840
but not worth it black and white act deaf in our chat room agrees black or white what

03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:48.900
act deaf in our chat room agrees get pokemon black or white because I just heard from pokemon

03:10:48.900 --> 03:10:53.460
phantom that gen 2 which would be silver and gold is like the best but I guess that's a

03:10:53.460 --> 03:10:59.580
lot of nostalgia talking so I'll yeah I'll pick up white oh which color are you gonna

03:11:30.600 --> 03:11:37.940
hey guys it's ddr dollar bill ddr dollar bill what's on your mind not much first off great

03:11:37.940 --> 03:11:42.700
show tonight thank you a little long but that's all right it's labor day that's cool it's much

03:11:42.700 --> 03:11:50.580
for fun that way all right I'll just make a sort of brief but uh they had a sale this

03:11:50.580 --> 03:11:56.700
week at Best Buy where they were so enchanted even for $10 oh yeah I heard about that huh

03:11:56.700 --> 03:12:03.620
yeah I I was like me and about three other co-workers were busy going to Best Buy website

03:12:03.620 --> 03:12:07.620
and trying our best to get our hands it again because they were they were just being sold

03:12:07.620 --> 03:12:16.820
out or back ordered everywhere it's just insane um but I did pick up a copy eventually and

03:12:16.820 --> 03:12:24.580
I want to say I was impressed but at the same time I wasn't well let's let's break it down

03:12:24.580 --> 03:12:29.020
let's start with the bad why why why did you leave with a feeling of me why weren't you

03:12:29.020 --> 03:12:35.100
impressed because I was trying with the kinetic controllers and waving my hands and it didn't

03:12:35.100 --> 03:12:43.300
feel responsive it really didn't feel responsive right like I couldn't I the controls confused

03:12:43.300 --> 03:12:47.700
me a bit because I couldn't tell even from a tutorial which was to lock on what was the

03:12:47.700 --> 03:12:52.780
auto fire what was this it was just bizarre please tell me you tried the controller at

03:12:52.780 --> 03:13:00.140
some point though uh not yet but only because I figured it's part since eventually I got

03:13:00.140 --> 03:13:04.580
the hang of it and since I was used to playing rez a lot I'm like okay now I got the hang

03:13:04.580 --> 03:13:10.060
of let's just play like rez yeah try try try the controller it's just like rez at some

03:13:10.060 --> 03:13:15.940
point try the controller you'll you'll be like okay this isn't so bad and plus it is

03:13:15.940 --> 03:13:20.500
instead of because there's different uh scoreboards for connect versus controller and so forth

03:13:20.500 --> 03:13:28.100
so you do get something out of it true I mean the opening visuals although a little long

03:13:28.100 --> 03:13:32.780
were very good I mean I loved it and I did love some of the uh backgrounds and graphics

03:13:32.780 --> 03:13:39.100
used and the music was okay it's just I didn't really pay attention to it because it's just

03:13:39.100 --> 03:13:42.780
it didn't seem to blend in so I couldn't hear the music I was just too busy focusing on

03:13:42.780 --> 03:13:48.140
the screen uh I think the problem is that so many people were talking so much hype about

03:13:48.140 --> 03:13:53.960
it I felt like I felt like I was gonna get this game and I was gonna go outside and start

03:13:53.960 --> 03:13:57.740
touching people and healing them because I always get the way the god power or something

03:13:57.740 --> 03:14:03.660
like maybe maybe the artsiness of the game was was hyped up too much yeah which is probably

03:14:03.660 --> 03:14:09.460
explains why I didn't like braid so much like I still love braid it's a great game I mean

03:14:09.460 --> 03:14:14.520
yeah some people like the people like to smell their own farts like are really into oh braid

03:14:14.520 --> 03:14:18.800
is an experience but yeah I just think braid is a solid game like it's a for like a download

03:14:18.800 --> 03:14:24.780
title it's just it's fun it wasn't bad it was just it was like the gameplay itself was

03:14:24.780 --> 03:14:33.260
nice the hype killed it the hype killed it the hype killed it yes and the ambiguous storyline

03:14:33.260 --> 03:14:43.560
sort of left me feeling let me feel a sense of blue balls like what the hell just happened

03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:48.160
all right well let's let's try to wrap on a positive note what did you enjoy on child

03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:51.680
of eden what you said you were left with mixed feelings so there was some good what was the

03:14:51.680 --> 03:14:56.920
good that you liked um the fact that like I said after I got used to connect controls

03:14:56.920 --> 03:15:02.660
and use the gameplay I figured okay it's kind of like rez but a little easier because rez

03:15:02.660 --> 03:15:08.080
at a few points got to be really insanely hard to the point of where you had a time

03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:14.140
everything precisely otherwise it just didn't work so but child of eden just played a lot

03:15:14.140 --> 03:15:18.900
easier and flowed a little better so you know I was okay with it I thought it was a good

03:15:18.900 --> 03:15:22.500
game I just didn't think was god's gift game but I thought it was a really good game though

03:15:22.500 --> 03:15:27.320
well I think the best news of all is you only paid ten dollars for it most people paid fifty

03:15:27.320 --> 03:15:35.040
so yeah and the craziest part was the pre-owned was 35 uh that's a little backwards I know

03:15:35.040 --> 03:15:41.300
I wonder how many people bought those just to sell them back to another store make some

03:15:41.300 --> 03:15:50.520
money all right uh ddr dollar bill any other thoughts tonight um I had them and they went

03:15:50.520 --> 03:15:53.760
out the window unfortunately you gotta write them down all right send us an email then

03:15:53.760 --> 03:15:57.640
when you think of them all right take it easy guys all right have a good one buddy take

03:15:57.640 --> 03:16:03.680
care bye uh 877 game olr or username on skype is orange launch radio let me get to some

03:16:03.680 --> 03:16:06.640
of these tweets here I've been neglecting the twitter because the phone's actually been

03:16:06.640 --> 03:16:13.300
uh uh lighting up here uh steve merryfield uh tweets us saying olr just got tickets to

03:16:13.300 --> 03:16:18.100
video games live here in salt lake city have any of you been to see it it will be my first

03:16:18.100 --> 03:16:22.080
uh yes I've been to see it it was the first time I ever met salacious pop for like five

03:16:22.080 --> 03:16:26.920
seconds was at video games live actually um right remember yeah in person I mean I knew

03:16:26.920 --> 03:16:30.760
you online but it was the first time I met you in person because I I found spike and

03:16:30.760 --> 03:16:35.920
you were with spike I think and no I was with uh frat mad actually yeah and uh I was like

03:16:35.920 --> 03:16:39.360
but I knew I knew I've known him for a long time we've been following each other on live

03:16:39.360 --> 03:16:44.480
journal for years and then right when we shook hands the lights went down yes to go sit but

03:16:44.480 --> 03:16:49.160
the show itself was a lot of fun um I think it's a very fun high energy show whereas like

03:16:49.160 --> 03:16:55.280
uh the final fantasy dear friends was very much a night out at the opera uh tommy talarico

03:16:55.280 --> 03:17:00.260
puts on a fun show and he's definitely about fun and bringing music you know and fusing

03:17:00.260 --> 03:17:05.020
fun we did an interview with him and I don't remember what episode number it is I'm sure

03:17:05.020 --> 03:17:09.200
it's on the olr wiki somewhere and it was a few years ago so it's back there I was in

03:17:09.200 --> 03:17:14.720
the episode 200 somewhere probably uh but it was great and uh you check that it was

03:17:14.720 --> 03:17:19.580
a long interview uh maybe somebody in chat will shout it out if some of the olr historians

03:17:19.580 --> 03:17:29.640
who know their wiki really well uh will find that so um yeah so uh I thought I had a really

03:17:29.640 --> 03:17:33.400
good time at video games live and so I think it's worth seeing at least once in your life

03:17:33.400 --> 03:17:39.080
uh do you agree alan did you like video games live yeah no yeah good stuff all right let's

03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:42.080
go to the phones you're getting another call hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this

03:17:42.080 --> 03:17:49.880
yo it's zino core from the okc how y'all doing hello okc zino core what is up buddy not much

03:17:49.880 --> 03:17:53.940
not much I hope everybody's been paying attention to what the hell good old gains has been doing

03:17:53.940 --> 03:17:57.760
lately because I've been playing the hell out of my copy of wind commander one and two

03:17:57.760 --> 03:18:01.840
I have not had the chance to bring this up I was thinking of it during the break and

03:18:01.840 --> 03:18:06.160
I forgot thank you for reminding me I did play good old games this week I finally made

03:18:06.160 --> 03:18:08.960
an account on there but do you know it wasn't the wing commander thing that put me over

03:18:08.960 --> 03:18:12.960
the edge although I think that's awesome it was the fact that they were giving away Ultima

03:18:12.960 --> 03:18:17.920
4 quest of the avatar for free oh yeah that's right I did hear about that one too god I

03:18:17.920 --> 03:18:21.920
miss the Ultima series it was a great series I mean yes I realize there's still Ultima

03:18:21.920 --> 03:18:26.960
online and all that stuff but man the Ultima series is a great series and you know you

03:18:26.960 --> 03:18:30.640
know they were gonna make a tenth one a few years ago and they just it was a canceled

03:18:30.640 --> 03:18:34.960
project yeah it was a 3d a full 3d engine and everything and I think it just got too

03:18:34.960 --> 03:18:40.840
big for what they were planning on yeah it's unfortunate but yes I made a GOG account this

03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:47.320
week to get my copy of Ultima 4 even though I could probably download a copy on an abandonware

03:18:47.320 --> 03:18:51.760
site somewhere but what I love about good old games or at least so far that I've experienced

03:18:51.760 --> 03:18:57.440
is that they have the little DOS box thing fine-tuned to work like I don't have to think

03:18:57.440 --> 03:19:02.760
about all these settings on how to emulate it just works and I like that I like that

03:19:02.760 --> 03:19:07.440
it just works yeah it's worth the six bucks especially with the Wing Commander packs that

03:19:07.440 --> 03:19:12.180
you're getting both Wing Commander one and two and the secret missions I think for one

03:19:12.180 --> 03:19:18.320
both one and two and on top of that they actually have the I what I think is the game development

03:19:18.320 --> 03:19:23.000
Bible for Wing Commander one and two because it covers every character every facet of the

03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:28.600
game through Wing Commander one secret operations Wing Commander two and three so it's like

03:19:28.600 --> 03:19:34.020
good lord it's the 50 megabyte PDF file what the hell's in this thing and it literally

03:19:34.020 --> 03:19:37.620
it's like the the resource document for a game design so it's like that that's kind

03:19:37.620 --> 03:19:42.600
of cool you know it on top of my purchase of Crusader Nora Morrison it's like I got

03:19:42.600 --> 03:19:46.160
to give props to these guys are finally getting the games I want to buy from them so yeah

03:19:46.160 --> 03:19:51.160
yeah so yeah good old games is you know if you if you are like why don't they make games

03:19:51.160 --> 03:19:53.880
like they used to or you just want to play something from your youth that doesn't seem

03:19:53.880 --> 03:19:57.200
to work on the computer check out good old games I will say this their library isn't

03:19:57.200 --> 03:20:02.320
vast right now like one of the first games I went to go look up on good old games because

03:20:02.320 --> 03:20:06.760
I like I would have paid 10 bucks for this game if I could find it it's a Sid Meier game

03:20:06.760 --> 03:20:12.000
that's not civilization it's not even colonization and this is actually one of the games he said

03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:16.540
he he in retrospect says it wasn't very good because they try to be too ambitious with

03:20:16.540 --> 03:20:22.680
it but I disagree and it's covert action Sid Meier's covert action is like this James Bond-ish

03:20:22.680 --> 03:20:28.120
type of game and its problem was that it was basically four separate games all thrown together

03:20:28.120 --> 03:20:34.420
but I love covert action and I was hoping it was on good old games but it's not I was

03:20:34.420 --> 03:20:39.720
hoping they pick up that one game spy craft that they ran back in like the early 90s that

03:20:39.720 --> 03:20:43.840
was all full motion video and stuff and all James Bond-esque even had live torture in

03:20:43.840 --> 03:20:48.640
there it's kind of weird it's done in our chat by the way is verifying it still free

03:20:48.640 --> 03:20:53.200
right now is at the time we're recording and put a link in chat at GOG.com for Ultima 4

03:20:53.200 --> 03:21:00.840
if you want to check it out yeah so everybody go get it now go on do it now anyway that's

03:21:00.840 --> 03:21:04.320
all I had make sure you love your old games guys as I show your old games some love I

03:21:04.320 --> 03:21:08.000
think that was a great tip thank you for bringing it up because I want to mention GOG but I

03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:12.040
got sidetracked with all the Disney talk well here I am putting you back on check all right

03:21:12.040 --> 03:21:18.760
thank you very much I appreciate it looking out for us take care all right bye all right

03:21:18.760 --> 03:21:25.560
interesting we've had a lot of calls that are tonight kind of endorsing online services

03:21:25.560 --> 03:21:31.360
it's kind of neat so wow some people in chat remember covert action I feel loved DDR dollar

03:21:31.360 --> 03:21:35.360
bill says fuck yeah and Kai's you know says covert action is the best I love that game

03:21:35.360 --> 03:21:42.760
oh my god act-deaf to by the way also went in the wiki and found it was episode 285 from

03:21:42.760 --> 03:21:49.800
June 29th 2008 had the Tommy Tallarico interview that would have been right around our seventh

03:21:49.800 --> 03:21:56.720
anniversary show it was probably the weekend before so there you go 285 as to where you

03:21:56.720 --> 03:22:04.360
can find episode 285 come into chat that or associate calm at some point and hell I might

03:22:04.360 --> 03:22:08.960
have it still somewhere but I'm sure is it some folks like dark to see and so forth have

03:22:08.960 --> 03:22:15.600
the old episodes and it might even be on the ol archive dot TK our FTP server thanks to

03:22:15.600 --> 03:22:21.240
the generosity of the web people to put it on including VX Jason XV is just the man that

03:22:21.240 --> 03:22:27.400
helps our website have a place to be up to our FTP some time ago so we haven't actually

03:22:27.400 --> 03:22:32.680
deleted anything from the FTP in like one or two years so you might it might still be

03:22:32.680 --> 03:22:37.900
on the FTP I'm just not sure so one thing that I thought was funny about that video

03:22:37.900 --> 03:22:44.120
games live performance we went to is that I feel that Bay Area geeks are kind of pretentious

03:22:44.120 --> 03:22:51.600
and how serious you know they take everything and that video games live was where they debuted

03:22:51.600 --> 03:22:58.440
their orchestra performance of the time scar Oh scar of time scar time from Chrono Cross

03:22:58.440 --> 03:23:03.840
and they they it was like a medley with a big song from Chrono Trigger and it was like

03:23:03.840 --> 03:23:09.560
the world premiere and everyone of course loved it but we were all so serious in the

03:23:09.560 --> 03:23:14.120
audience that like no no one made a peep because it was such an awesome moment for those those

03:23:14.120 --> 03:23:19.200
beautiful songs to be played but I think Tommy Tallarico was like like he didn't like it's

03:23:19.200 --> 03:23:23.040
like they're all just dead in the audience but we were just all in there and I was just

03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:27.120
really into it like they are it very people don't fuck around yeah and he kept for us

03:23:27.120 --> 03:23:31.180
to play this next song everyone stand up say yeah and like pump your fists and we're like

03:23:31.180 --> 03:23:36.160
we don't do that here bro we're very serious we don't hoot and holler in San Francisco

03:23:36.160 --> 03:23:41.320
we're serious business I think that kind of went against his personality but I mean but

03:23:41.320 --> 03:23:47.860
also I I Tommy does great things I'm not slamming what he does but I think to do that like like

03:23:47.860 --> 03:23:53.920
fist pump for Chrono Cross not really like you fist pump for Halo you fist pump for you

03:23:53.920 --> 03:23:57.480
know those those other types of high energy games I'm not saying that Chrono Cross is

03:23:57.480 --> 03:24:00.400
a boring game or whatever but it's just you know role-playing games are a little different

03:24:00.400 --> 03:24:06.720
it's art damn it yes yes thank you it's art damn it all right there's hella people in

03:24:06.720 --> 03:24:11.320
our chat room that are like fuck yeah free Ultima 4 I will say this I had Ultima 4 on

03:24:11.320 --> 03:24:18.280
the NES it was so good like it's just it's hard as fuck but it is good it's a good game

03:24:18.280 --> 03:24:23.480
all right anyhow back to tweets we keep being derailed from tweets tonight let's see going

03:24:23.480 --> 03:24:30.160
to redertainment which game coming out holiday do you think will be the biggest bust I think

03:24:30.160 --> 03:24:35.680
Skyrim will disappoint but uncharted 3 will sell poorly oh that's an interesting question

03:24:35.680 --> 03:24:40.320
entertainment says which game do you think will be the biggest bust this holiday I actually

03:24:40.320 --> 03:24:45.480
disagree I think Skyrim is gonna do awesome but that's total fanboy in me what do you

03:24:45.480 --> 03:24:51.040
think Loki you're grinning over there what what game do you think will be a bust Skylanders

03:24:51.040 --> 03:24:57.400
I fucking hate Skylanders I hope it burns oh is that the the game with the pets and

03:24:57.400 --> 03:25:04.480
stuff it's a game from Activision starring Spyro Skylanders yes you ran it about this

03:25:04.480 --> 03:25:12.460
before fuck that burns and fire um I'm see I would have said Star Wars connect but they

03:25:12.460 --> 03:25:18.240
already bumped it to 2012 so now I'm in a predicament what do I say is going to disappoint

03:25:18.240 --> 03:25:21.760
this holiday I don't know I feel like everything that might have disappointed got bumped to

03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:25.280
Christmas I don't think I can say the 3ds because it's no longer got the Vita to compete

03:25:25.280 --> 03:25:30.880
with well I could say one but it's probably just a no-brainer Silent Hill but yeah but

03:25:30.880 --> 03:25:36.400
I don't even consider that like a big title with high expectations I I don't know I don't

03:25:36.400 --> 03:25:46.040
know what would possibly disappoint so then I reloaded somebody's gonna really hate me

03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:51.600
for saying this I think the game will be great but Dance Central too I think that I don't

03:25:51.600 --> 03:25:57.360
think it's gonna be quite as huge of a deal as the first one and it's because the market

03:25:57.360 --> 03:26:02.200
has been saturated because now you have the Just Dance and so far I hope it doesn't but

03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:05.560
I don't know there's this weird part of me that's kind of like I don't think it's gonna

03:26:05.560 --> 03:26:09.800
make waves like the first one did I hope I'm wrong I hope I'm wrong because I really like

03:26:09.800 --> 03:26:14.120
those games but I just think the markets gonna be very saturated and I'm a little worried

03:26:14.120 --> 03:26:19.880
Knights of the Old Republic MMO you are just going for the throat and all of those wow

03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:25.000
players that are really don't like wow and want Knights of the Old Republic to just finally

03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:29.040
take me away from wow please Jesus God six years have been playing this shed be the promised

03:26:29.040 --> 03:26:33.940
land and they're gonna play and it's gonna be like oh no this isn't the solution I was

03:26:33.940 --> 03:26:42.440
looking for that's that's a clever response I like that all right anyhow moving on to

03:26:42.440 --> 03:26:48.880
other tweets spazinator sends us a very interesting tweets well it finally happened I have become

03:26:48.880 --> 03:26:54.200
an ex-bot fuck Sony I'll pirate their shit before I buy any of their stuff again sorry

03:26:54.200 --> 03:26:59.320
I won't be in chat personal stuff going on now if you've been listening to orange on

03:26:59.320 --> 03:27:02.600
radio for the past I don't know a couple of years spazinator calls in pretty reliably

03:27:02.600 --> 03:27:06.720
once a month if not a little more often that and talks about the latest going on on PSN

03:27:06.720 --> 03:27:10.000
especially the video marketplace but he's also run into some major issues when it comes

03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:14.640
to he's had like three of them break down on him so I'm very curious to see what sent

03:27:14.640 --> 03:27:19.140
him over the edge like was it one more breakdown was it one bad customer service call like

03:27:19.140 --> 03:27:23.540
I've got to know like what fucking just because that and I wouldn't I would not see those

03:27:23.540 --> 03:27:28.200
tweets coming from spazinator like what fucking broke him like I've got to know I've got to

03:27:28.200 --> 03:27:33.160
know right yeah and he had problems where he would buy games and then he would get a

03:27:33.160 --> 03:27:37.600
new console but they wouldn't unlock his games for him yeah yeah he had a lot of problems

03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:43.240
with them I don't know so pod culture sent us a tweet that says hello from dragon con

03:27:43.240 --> 03:27:46.800
so we want to say hello right back to pod culture sorry you and bobby couldn't get

03:27:46.800 --> 03:27:51.240
on the show tonight we had a late start live we miss you guys and congrats on your parsec

03:27:51.240 --> 03:27:58.240
award that you won for your podcast the tardis interruptus the name escaped me for a minute

03:27:58.240 --> 03:28:03.440
there but thank you the doctor who podcast moving on to some tweets from tiger claw a

03:28:03.440 --> 03:28:07.080
couple tweets here I read this right before the show this is fascinating to me League

03:28:07.080 --> 03:28:13.140
of Legends shutting down mac support tweets tiger claw a story that after a year of beta

03:28:13.140 --> 03:28:17.160
testing riot games is just canceling mac off support for League of Legends it will be ending

03:28:17.160 --> 03:28:22.200
at midnight on Tuesday they've said quote our current approach regarding the mac platform

03:28:22.200 --> 03:28:27.840
won't guarantee the quality and frequent updates we deliver today on the pc they're not ruling

03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:31.680
out a mac version in the future they say they are committed to building a solution that

03:28:31.680 --> 03:28:35.300
will work on the mac in the long run but it will take some time the shutdown will be effective

03:28:35.300 --> 03:28:40.960
midnight on September 6 now the beta testers who used League of Legends they can either

03:28:40.960 --> 03:28:45.000
get a full refund if they use the store or they can keep their accounts open and play

03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:50.320
on a pc all the mac players will get a code for a champion pack a mac player means that

03:28:50.320 --> 03:28:54.360
the majority of the logins came from the mac client those have to also be redeemed before

03:28:54.360 --> 03:28:58.160
Tuesday so if you're a mac player League of Legends go get your free ship before they

03:28:58.160 --> 03:29:06.280
shut it down right pretty much is what it is that's a bummer uh let's see also another

03:29:06.280 --> 03:29:11.580
tweet here uh he sent us a tweet about that whole comcast story it's not directly related

03:29:11.580 --> 03:29:17.840
to games but did you hear about how comcast uh in a nutshell hurricane irene happened

03:29:17.840 --> 03:29:22.120
and shut down the power and comcast won't refund people for it because they say that's

03:29:22.120 --> 03:29:31.320
an act of god but if you don't believe in god tricky tricky uh no you're right it could

03:29:31.320 --> 03:29:36.160
be i don't know but i'm sorry i don't believe in god so they consider a hurricane part of

03:29:36.160 --> 03:29:40.600
that but here's the thing i also kind of why don't you just call it act of nature you can't

03:29:40.600 --> 03:29:45.440
dispute it is nature whatever i'm not going to get into that because it's way too controversial

03:29:45.440 --> 03:29:50.560
for our little video game show however i will say this i i it's not that i'm siding with

03:29:50.560 --> 03:29:54.480
comcast in this i kind of just think you should do the goodwill thing and you know it was

03:29:54.480 --> 03:29:57.680
a pretty big event you should just chip in the extra extra couple days internet and suck

03:29:57.680 --> 03:30:04.680
it up but i mean you guys you guys power outages are gonna happen and like you will be without

03:30:04.680 --> 03:30:10.680
cable tv and you know i understand that's gonna happen but they're you know the power

03:30:10.680 --> 03:30:16.720
company doesn't charge me for power that i'm using when there's no power and you know what

03:30:16.720 --> 03:30:20.800
comcast could easily fucking bury their goddamn lines in the ground we wouldn't have any of

03:30:20.800 --> 03:30:27.520
this problem i i i do think they should just suck it up and do it out of goodwill but i

03:30:27.520 --> 03:30:31.920
also at the same time i'm just saying you know what they're these are risks you take

03:30:31.920 --> 03:30:37.320
and i kind of think it's justified a little bit i think it's bad at customer relations

03:30:37.320 --> 03:30:45.600
but it's it's it's not a illegal business decision i just think it's not gonna keep

03:30:45.600 --> 03:30:50.440
people in their good graces that's all

03:30:50.440 --> 03:30:55.120
when i worked at pac bell and we had a two or three day outage of dsl broadband in a

03:30:55.120 --> 03:31:00.840
certain area or just just like our email service went down for a couple days we would say okay

03:31:00.840 --> 03:31:05.440
you're paying 20 bucks a month it was down for three days i have supervisor approval

03:31:05.440 --> 03:31:11.480
to refund you for seven cents and of course the customer would go completely batshit but

03:31:11.480 --> 03:31:15.960
it's like this this is in our it's in our terms of terms and conditions that we have

03:31:15.960 --> 03:31:22.120
outages right and you're agreeing to deal with that right all right sorry it's probably

03:31:22.120 --> 03:31:26.080
not the popular response you were hoping from us angry people at olr but you know we you

03:31:26.080 --> 03:31:30.460
have to kind of look at both sides of it i'm just happy that the hurricane didn't end up

03:31:30.460 --> 03:31:35.280
being as horrific as they thought i mean yes i understand vermont flooded and some people

03:31:35.280 --> 03:31:42.120
were in bad situations and that really sucks however i'm glad it wasn't as terrible as

03:31:42.120 --> 03:31:45.800
they were saying in the beginning right like we were thinking it was going to be even worse

03:31:45.800 --> 03:31:52.720
so i'm just really glad it wasn't even worse anyhow uh one more tweet from tiger claw and

03:31:52.720 --> 03:31:55.600
this is interesting because it's about i didn't hear about this for the show tonight but i

03:31:55.600 --> 03:32:03.080
guess there is an uncharted 3 trailer that is uh out and it is a portuguese trailer and

03:32:03.080 --> 03:32:11.280
they did a version of it that i guess i guess the way they translated the trailer or whatever

03:32:11.280 --> 03:32:17.040
and the way the voices sound and so forth isn't going over very well in brazil and they're

03:32:17.040 --> 03:32:21.120
going to naughty dogs forums to just basically yell at people and say that you know you don't

03:32:21.120 --> 03:32:24.400
even know what the hell you're doing basically it's kind of like you know when you get a

03:32:24.400 --> 03:32:30.480
really bad english dub here like come on who didn't see one of those videos for heavy rain

03:32:30.480 --> 03:32:35.520
jason jason like you know and it was very obviously french people doing english accents

03:32:35.520 --> 03:32:38.720
you know it's kind of like that similar thing but we take a lot of that for granted because

03:32:38.720 --> 03:32:44.320
you know if it's english the most you know between that and japanese like the two languages

03:32:44.320 --> 03:32:50.460
used in most games we just take for granted that uh the other languages probably sound

03:32:50.460 --> 03:32:58.920
all right too and this is a case where it doesn't so there you go all right and a couple

03:32:58.920 --> 03:33:05.840
more tweets here uh dart ditsuya tweeted us and said here's confirmation the anaheim move

03:33:05.840 --> 03:33:09.840
for wondercon was confirmed there will not be wondercon in san francisco next year it's

03:33:09.840 --> 03:33:16.720
in anahine moscone center is being completely like that wing of it is being shut down for

03:33:16.720 --> 03:33:22.480
renovations so the weekend that they would want to have it no choice it's yeah no choice

03:33:22.480 --> 03:33:28.080
all right and lastly tonight shad leland tweets us saying forgot to mention on the phone dance

03:33:28.080 --> 03:33:32.080
