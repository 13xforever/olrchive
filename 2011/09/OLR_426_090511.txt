Tonight, September 4th, 2011, a former QA tester sues one developer.
Details on Dragon Quest X are soon to be revealed.
And will there soon be a museum dedicated to video games?
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of that show where every gamer has a voice.
Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live.
It is Sunday, September the 4th of 2011.
It's Labor Day weekend and we're live at All Games Radio.
www.allgames.com where we are live every week at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
Although not tonight.
He had the night off.
He's at Dragon Con and I know he's going to have a full report on all of that next week.

TechMasterLoki
And Loki, oh my gosh, we're having so much fun tonight.
You're not plugged in tonight, Loki.
We're having a little bit of fail tonight, and I'll get to that in a minute.
I'm sure everybody's like, tonight?
Isn't that every night you have a little fail?
Okay, try again, Loki.
Alright.
Techmaster Loki!
And everybody had it wrong.
It wasn't anything, it wasn't double bacon strips.
It was a double western bacon cheeseburger from Carl's Jr.
Or Hardee's, I guess, on the east coast.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Podcast listeners, you got the better end of the deal because we are 25 minutes late in starting tonight.
We're struggling.
It's a very struggling evening.
Yes, and we've just had tech fail.
We've had can't get into the studio when Jamie's not here fail.
We've just had all sorts of problems, so I apologize.
But we'll find our rhythm eventually and put on a show.
And Dan is yelling at us in the living room to quit complaining.
So anyway, let's go back to Salacious Pop.
And you're here, but you haven't been here a little while.
When was the last time you were on the show?
I want to say it was either April or before.
I think it's kind of funny that now that I actually live up in Sacramento where Studio OLR is, roughly, I'm on the show far less than I was before, even though I'm living with one of the co-hosts.
So for those that are new to Orange Lawn Tradio and maybe haven't heard you on the show before, tell us a little bit about yourself.
What kind of games are you into?
What do you like?
I've been gaming since I was four or five.
My first system was an Atari 2600.
Most of my gaming was probably done during the SNES and PS1 generations.
I own all the systems and have a ton of games, but I don't really console game much anymore.
I'm mostly a PC gamer.
I'm more into gaming culture.
um those are my people but as far as actually sitting down when we'll get to this when we get to my um gaming week don't really play as much as I used to what do you mean by like gaming culture and those are my people when you say that just the various fandoms and you know following the sort of you know I still follow the news for games that I know I'm not going to play but I still find it interesting and
But there are some games you still do play today, right?
Of course You still have all the systems, 360, PS3, right?
Yep, the only one I didn't get this generation was the Wii So, not missing much Top three games ever Not to put you on the spot or anything If you can't think of your top three, just like three really freaking great games Super Metroid Good pick Valkyrie Profile That's a good pick too
and Street Fighter Alpha 2.
Why Alpha 2 and not just straight up 2?
Which is the most notable, I suppose.
I think the Alpha or Zero series is the best Street Fighter has ever been as far as art design, play style, combo system, music, everything.
Dan came in here and gave the big thumbs up.
I think all is forgiven now.
Yeah.
DarkSakura
What?
That's what it sounds like, because in place of DarkSakura.
Oh, shut up.
All right.
Anyhow, you guys are crazy.
All right, we're going to get into how was your gaming week.
But first, we weren't here last week.
So not only have we had a little bit of fail and starting a little late tonight, but we were not here at all last week.
Salacious Pop and I were at Disneyland.
Which was awesome, I don't have to tell you twice A lot of lulzy, funny stuff about the Electronica event that happens at Disneyland Because if you guys don't know what Electronica is, it happens at Disneyland California Adventure, the second park down there, Westcott if you will It is an event that happens at night Which is becoming more like the first park to be honest
E3 Electronica
Thanks for watching!
and all these cool little Tron decorations and people dressed up in Tron gear.
And they're basically having like a giant rave and playing like Daft Punk and that sort of music.
I don't know.
Am I saying everything correctly here, Salacious Pop, about Electronica?
Yeah, sounds about right.
So...
We love Electronica because we're nerds and we love Tron.
Tron is one of the greatest Disney products there is, right?
Electronica was not supposed to be at the park anymore.
It was supposed to finish not long after the movie came out.
And it's been extended time and time and time again.
And the most recent news on the net was it's being extended through Spring 2012.
Thanks for watching!
I was talking to an employee kind of candidly about Electronica and he said, well, yeah, you know, it's closing after Labor Day.
And we're like, what?
It's closing after Labor Day?
But we heard it was spring 2012 and we have like all these people that we know that are coming to the park in October like just to go to Electronica and check it out before it closes.
And he was like, well, yeah, it's closing after Labor Day and it's, you know, it's probably going to come back in a different configuration.
and we were like, oh my gosh.
So, making posts to Facebook, angry friends making comments about how could Electronica close before they see it.
It was like telling a bunch of preschoolers that Santa Claus had died.
Yeah, basically.
They were like, what, no!
It was, yeah, or just like slapping ice cream out of their hand.
Same reaction.
What is that thing, coning, or whatever?
It's like that, where you grab the top of the cone, that dumbass thing.
So it was stupid.
Yes, it was!
So, anyhow...
To make a long story short, too late I know, we found out that yes, Electronica is closing after Labor Day, but for three weeks.
Then it's coming back, weekends only, through spring.
You have to understand, they're putting Electronica in the Disney vault, and then they're going to re-release it later on as special editions.
because that's what Disney does with everything so finally we figured that out so my friends that are going to the park in October are happy because they'll get to see it because they're going on a weekend so it doesn't matter that it's weekends only, it's fine Miklatov was going to be going the week before it reopens and now he's pissed so I'm not supposed to probably be talking about that on the show but oh well, what are you going to do and look at that, he just joined chat to stomp and pout with our chatters at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
so uh yeah so we had fun at Disneyland and Electronica and all that and um so that's where we were last week and we just ended up having the show off because Jamie was helping a friend move and you know Loki's got the kids so he enjoys a week off
Thanks for watching!
It's just like the arcade in the movie and all the machines actually work.
And how often do you get to go to an arcade where the machines freaking work?
Since Starcade is ruined, they should make it permanent.
Dan is saying since Starcade is ruined, they should just make it permanent.
They should.
They should move Flynn's into Starcade.
But here's the rumors about the replacement.
I don't mean to turn this into a Disney podcast, but deal.
They're going to replace Electronica with the Mad Tea Party.
Based off of the Tim Burton.
But if you think about it, it's going to be so easy to convert.
All they have to do, get Zeus, a Mad Hatter outfit, get all the dancers, little, you know, wacky colors and stuff.
And then close Flynn's Arcade or turn it into a tea room or something.
I hope that doesn't happen.
I think Flynn's Arcade should stay a fixture, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
Well, they need to move Flynn's Arcade to the part that's next to Space Mountain.
Because they used to have Tron stuff in Tomorrowland.
Well, see, here's the thing, though, is that since Star Tours is all new, they want all that business in the area or what have you.
So, I don't know.
It would be nice.
But...
Sadly, there's just not a lot of arcade love in the world anymore.
And I think that even at Disneyland you're seeing it.
Get rid of that stupid Imagineering spinning piece of crap that was there.
How fucking badass would it be if they would take that dome and turn it into some type of light disc battle?
Like a battle arena, like a Tron battle arena.
Where there could be a ride where you go around in a little light bike or something.
It could just be all neon inside.
I mean, it would cost hella money to renovate that place, but it would be
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So it's very old.
I remember that, but remember the rocket rods went really fast.
So have some sort of motorcycle ride thing.
Sweet.
And you can find Marvel merchandise at Disneyland now because of that.
Not really a merger.
They bought Marvel outright.
Right.
But in a lot of the Disney merch stores, you can find Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, action figures, the 316 Wii games, all that stuff.
I wonder when we're going to see some of those themed rides.
Because you know how all the Six Flags stuff have the DC rides?
Yeah, that's right.
They have the Superman.
Superman, Batman, and all that.
Again, I don't mean to turn this into a Disney podcast, but whatever.
It's an off night tonight anyway.
Here's the thing.
I think if Disney ever does do a third gate in Anaheim, which they have the space for, but it would mean California Ventures has got to be successful.
I think if they do a third park, they might do a third park about Marvel stuff.
And it could even be a thrill ride park to compete with Magic Mountain, but I don't know.
I'm not going to hold my breath.
and the Disney doesn't really have thrill parks because they're not very family friendly but I don't know I think one could be successful there
I think that's what California Adventure started off as.
Okay, we're going to try everything that didn't really fit in Disneyland.
And now it's like, we need more Disneyland in here.
Going to our chat room for some comments.
At least the chatters are into this tonight.
TigerClaw says, they will bring Electronica back when Tron 3 comes out.
You know, that's a distinct possibility.
I hope to God it's true they're making a Tron 3.
I heard the Bruce Boxleitner interview that 2013...
and they certainly have loaded and set it up for one in the Blu-ray so I really hope that does happen.
DarkTetsuya says Rob should work for Disney Imagineering.
Actdeft says if any Disney employee is listening they should hire Rob as an Imagineer.
Oh, I would love that.
In fact, I would just turn everything into Tron in Tomorrowland.
Hey, I'm down.
Autotopia?
Make a Tron!
I can Imagineer like... Space Mountain?
Tron!
I can Imagineer like anything.
I mean, just... Whatever you need, I'll Imagineer it.
Build it?
No, I'm not really good at doing that part, but hell, I can imagine all sorts of crazy things.
Disney Podcasts.
fuck the kids, Disneyland's for me that would probably be the name of it but I don't know how well that would do and how much Disney would approve of something like that so, didn't happen Disneyland's just something we really like
So anyhow, let's go back to games.
So we were off for a week.
So we don't have a lot of news in the show world tonight about what happened last week.
But I've got to talk about... I was going to say PAX happened, but I don't think that was really... PAX happened and surprisingly not a ton of news out of PAX.
I mean, in the indie scene and so forth, yes, and expansions, a few things like that.
But nothing major and I was...
Proven wrong.
Games analysts aren't always right.
I thought for sure Nintendo would announce those games.
Xenoblade and so forth coming out here.
They did not take the opportunity to at PAX.
I don't think it's happening.
They didn't do much of anything at PAX, did they?
No.
In fact, I didn't really hear even what they were showing at their booth.
I imagine it was all the 3DS stuff.
It's got to be what they were.
Well, they announced some new 3DS stuff, but we'll get into that later.
And then...
Yeah, it's pretty... And it's funny, they haven't really even announced the dates yet for the two Mario games on the 3DS.
It's just we know it's November, December, but they've already announced everything up through the end of November.
Where are those titles?
Oh, well, we'll come back to that.
We'll figure it out.
See how one of these other games do.
So the big news that happened last week was about a company I've been critical of on this show in the past.
It was GameStop.
I like Bobby's name for him.
I think I might jack the name.
Evil G is what he always calls him on the show.
I might call him that.
And I don't mean to disrespect the people working the front lines at the stores and so forth because I understand those of you that make very little money serving the customer directly are in a very thankless job.
And my beef with Evil G is not with those people.
Although some do get a bad rap, and I have been to some stores where those guys are a-holes.
But that's not my beef.
My beef with GameStop has to do with much higher management and some of the decisions they make and some of the ways that they run their company.
And funny enough, a lot of that came to light this last week.
I'm sure I don't need to report this.
I'm sure all of you have heard this or read it on a gaming blog somewhere.
But if you've been living in a cave, I'll kind of sum it up for you.
A new game was released last week, DarkSakura.
Deus Ex Streaming Service
Thank you for watching!
So they want to show off their service, try to get more people on OnLive, and get people buying games over there.
So they put in a coupon, some type of partnership with Square Enix, where you would be able to get a free version of Deus Ex on OnLive with a PC version.
Well, Evil G didn't like that, because Evil G just recently bought one of these online streaming companies, a competitor of OnLive, if you will, and clearly plans to launch their own service.
So, an internal memo was leaked to the internet where Evil G told their employees essentially to go open all of the boxes of Deus Ex on the PC, take out the code, and throw them away.
And that's that.
And so, obviously a lot of people not happy to know that the employees opened the product and took something out of it.
And then sold it as new.
And then sold it as new.
Which is funny to me because...
this isn't a new policy at the G this is not something new for them we've heard for years on the internet and so forth about how they open games let employees rent them and take them home and then bring them back to the store and sell them as a new game sometimes they reshrink them
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Let's be real.
I'm sure you can't cross-save.
The on-live servers don't talk to the PC yet.
So this on-live thing, and you're playing your normal version of the PC anyway, this on-live thing is really just a, oh, neat, I have it.
I play it for five minutes and then, neat, I saw it.
I'm done.
I bet very, very, very, very few people are truly using that coupon.
But because that coupon, you feel like it's a $50 value, now Evil G has ripped that out of your hands and you're pissed.
And now there's an issue.
with the policy that they've been doing for years.
And so this all came to light and it's been really, really bad for them.
Here's the surprising thing.
I'm slightly sympathetic towards GameStop.
I actually think it was kind of screwed up of Squeenix to include a competitor's coupon and not tell Evil G what they were doing.
The appropriate response is what GameStop did at the end of the day.
Finally, the next day, or maybe very late that day, they said, you know what?
We're taking this game off our shelves altogether, and we're sending the boxes back to Square Enix.
That's what should have been done in the first place.
If it had been done in the first place, none of this would have ever happened.
They wouldn't have had the bad rap.
I mean, sure, there'd be people that go, oh, GameStop won't sell Deus Ex on the PC.
Too good, huh?
But...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
but what it did is it just brought this whole thing to light of you mean they're opening new things and then reselling them as new like who the fuck does that Best Buy doesn't do that Target doesn't do that Walmart doesn't do that yeah because if you think about it like let's just take it to the extreme here what if they were say there was some bonus download content that came with a game like say Gears of War or something like that comes with like a map pack or something like that and they decide hey you know what we're gonna break open all the copies of Gears of War we're gonna take it out and we're gonna sell that map pack separately
and then we're also gonna sell the game as new so it's brought this policy of theirs to light and part of me of course is doing the Nelson laugh pointing and going you know I've been telling you guys for a while this is you know part of their crap policies and so forth but you know whatever I'm sure people will forget about this in a couple weeks and continue to buy their games from there
But it was interesting to kind of see that all come to light.
And I think the appropriate response was what happened at the end of the day.
But unfortunately GameStop is too comfortable with let's open new things and then resell them as new.
And finally the public was like wait a minute you can't do that.
When I go to Fry's and that's been done there's an open box that's cheaper that I buy because the box has been opened.
GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop GameStop
Oh, no fucking you didn't.
We're not going to sell your fucking games anymore.
And they're like, oh, wait a second.
We'll go ahead and take those games back.
We're sorry.
We shouldn't have ever done that.
And we as the consumer have given GameStop that monopoly.
Oh, yeah.
And if you want that shit to stop, you need to take it away.
You need to take that monopoly away.
There is no way.
I'm not going to hold my breath.
I don't think it's going to happen.
They're not the only company out there that sells games.
They're not even the best company out there that sells games.
It's just something.
A product.
You can go to a bunch of other stores and buy that product.
And guess what?
Those stores didn't take out the coupons for OnLive.
And it's because they feel that they have this new service.
Well, can you wait and see what's going to happen when that new streaming service comes around?
That's going to be fun.
I think that it might have been on a Bobby Blackwolf show last week or the week before.
Someone had called in and said that they had worked at an indie game retail shop and that they offered much better trade-in credit for used games than GameStop did, but they could not get people to shop there because, oh, if I get the game at GameStop, my green dude will get a costume coat for a slightly lighter shade of green.
and people eat that shit up they do eat that shit up and it's sad it's sad because that's what they're such a big company now that they can make those deals and those deals ensure more people come to you know those stores and it screws everybody else out and even sometimes you know they'll be like yeah you know we want to have the exclusive on that special edition or whatever or they'll put out some other thing and it's all funded by the publishers because the publishers will do whatever the fuck they want because they're the majority you know if they don't have the GameStop business they
Go under.
Yeah, if your game's not at GameStop, that's a huge coverage of distribution that you've lost.
Let me read this comment in our chatroom at chat.orangelandry.com.
Kaijudo in chat says, In GameStop's defense, Square Enix and OnLive were in the wrong on the coupon side.
Both parties were not in the right.
I actually agree with that.
And I do think Square Enix needed to apologize to GameStop because that wasn't cool to include a competitor's coupon.
This is truly a case of, though, two wrongs don't make a right because who got hurt in the end?
Did Square Enix get hurt?
Did GameStop get hurt?
No.
The...
Buyers got hurt.
I don't really feel so bad for GameStop because their service is not live.
It's not done yet.
It's not even launched.
It's not even in a beta yet.
I don't feel bad for GameStop because they've been opening shit for years and reselling it as new.
I understand that, but I'm saying there's no reason they should have had to apologize to them in the first place because it's like saying, oh, I'm going to sell this at Walmart.
Walmart's like, oh, well, we're going to take the code out because we're going to come out with our own streaming service five years from now.
Oh, well, I'm sorry I didn't confirm with you to see if you have a streaming service coming.
I mean, big fucking deal.
Yeah, you bought a company and you say it's coming out in the spring of 2012, but is it really going to come out then?
I mean, this thing could be delayed to 2013.
And really, what...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Go ahead.
They didn't do this with Portal 2, which came with the Steam integration code.
Actually, that does make sense because they're streaming.
They're talking about streaming.
See if there was some sort of streaming copy.
But they also have their digital store that they do sell stuff in.
Anyhow, all I got to say is that as long as the consumer continues to give GameStop the monopoly, this shit's going to happen.
But GameStop's scared because they're looking five years ahead.
And I think they are a little worried.
And I think they should be to some extent.
Stories like this aren't helping.
It's just pushing digital distribution up faster and the life cycle of the GameStop store.
Think of it, guys.
GameStop is going to go the way of Blockbuster in five to ten years.
Think about it.
Digital distribution doesn't matter just because it's just another segment of the business that's not going to take over the business.
And the reason why is because people like physical copies of things.
Some things, though, people can get away with getting digitally, like certain games.
I don't care about that.
And actually, it's kind of the publisher's fault a little bit because nowadays, hell, they're not even throwing manuals in there.
It's just a case with a disc in it, and that's it.
Alright, I want to get to this week's news, but let me do a couple more comments from our chatroom.
After all, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
SonicM88 in our chat at chat.orange.radio.com says, I also have a good friend who works at GameStop, so I'm a little partial.
And that's in response to something you said earlier.
I go to GameStop for the knowledge.
Their employees always know the most about gaming.
and so yeah you know I think every store is different in that capacity it just kind of depends and there are I mean like I said at the top my always my beef is GameStop has never been the front line employees it's like any other business some of them are jerks and I don't want to shop at those stores but there are some really decent people who work at GameStop and that are very knowledgeable about games
However, the bonehead mistakes of management, such as what occurred here, is just going to hurt all those people.
And it's unfortunate.
And I understand that it's good to have knowledgeable staff at your stores.
But at the same time, the consumer needs to educate themselves on games.
I mean, you don't go blindly into it.
Obviously, if you're going into a game store, you kind of have an idea of what you want.
I mean, and we're talking in a day and age where there's the internet.
I mean, if you want to educate yourself on anything.
Does Dan want a mic?
People who come into game stores 99% of the time don't know dick about what they want.
Nothing.
You know what you want when you go into a game store, but that's because you're an ultra gamer.
Most people come in and they're just like, and they come to you and they're like, tell me what's good.
That's why there's a GameStop.
That's why GameStop even exists.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Everyone there knows about all the games.
Bring it back.
Bring it back, motherfucker.
Do it!
Well, then those type of people anyway should be shopping at Walmart anyways because they're, you know, brainless drones that will just stumble right in to buy any game that you say is good.
Well, right, but exactly.
Yes.
Well, then they're not going to do the difference and all you have to do is educate yourself.
Hey, well, these people are stupid.
They're just going to buy whatever you tell them to and they're like, okay.
That's why GameStop exists.
That's why GameStop makes money.
And that's why GameStop's important.
Because they've got tremendous pull in the industry.
The people who go to Walmart are either just pointing and shooting and hoping for a good game, or it's someone like you who goes, I ain't going to GameStop.
I'll just stop by Walmart or Target and hope they have it on the shelf and just bag it.
But for the unwashed masses...
That's why you hope that you go to a specialty retailer with a crew that knows about games.
And there's plenty of other specialty retailers out there.
You know, Play and Trade, lots of indies.
Right, right, sure.
There's a couple.
Look at Sacramento.
How many Play and Trades do we have?
Do we even still have one?
Folsom's gone, right?
Yeah, Folsom's gone.
Okay, and how many indies do we have?
Three?
A few.
A few.
There aren't many left.
And I think that's terrible because I loved independent game stores.
That's the reason I ended up working at GameStop because I was going to use Funco Land at the moment to teach myself to run an independent game store.
But the problem is that the Akira wave hit and they just engulfed all the other retailers.
And what killed GameStop was when they got EB.
because when they got EB there was no incentive to be a better company because they were the fucking company and now they're only competing on an area where they're so concerned about oh the intangible competition of this coupon right OnLive was really really competing with GameStop's non-existent streaming service good job guys way to embrace the added value I'm sure all two dozen people who keep OnLive because of that coupon are going to never go to GameStop again right dipshits
Of course, let's also remember that like seven GameStops still sell any amount of PC games anyway.
Fuck.
I'm done.
All right, Dan's rant from the front lines.
He's been there in the front.
And I do think we need to also fairly, you know, in the chats, there's some chatter in our chat room, fairly slap Square Enix on the wrist here too.
They are not without fault in this whole story.
Seriously, Final Fantasy XIV, what's going on there?
It's really Final Fantasy XIV's fault when all's said and done.
But no, seriously, I mean, they do have a responsibility.
It was not cool of them to, two days before, spring it on everybody, including the retailers, oh, by the way, we're pushing on live in this.
You know, that wasn't cool.
You know, I think it's cooler than, you know, say, THQ going, oh, by the way, we have this thing where you have to buy the game new, otherwise you gotta pay $10 to play online.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Yeah.
Suckas!
I still think the problem at the end of the day although I think Dan does make a very good point that they're one of the few places left that's all about the games and the completely clueless can at least kind of have an idea of a place where to go I think even people like that when they hear about this in the mainstream media and it was on CNN it was on CBSNews.com this was picked up by the mainstream media and it's funny we have a story later tonight that's going to get into the lulls about the local news and how they can skew stories and so forth I think when they
Do this stuff and communicate it to the masses.
The masses are like, oh, GameStop's ripping people off.
Well, I'm not going to go there anymore.
These people that are completely clueless about their games are also pretty fickle.
And I think when they find out that there are other options available to them,
you know this is this is a great opportunity for companies like Best Buy um I think Target I'm trying to think of who's been trying to strengthen their gaming lately I know we've heard the reports about the Best Buys doing something and I think um I want to say there was a Target initiative too because they were doing buybacks to games and forth in the end of the day this is going to work out really well for them it's about seizing this opportunity I think so
I think Amazon, don't they have new gaming stuff?
But Amazon's weird because they're such a huge company, but we never see them.
They're just out on the internet.
If you listen to what Dana just said about people needing advice on what freaking games to buy, I think that kind of answers the question as to why Amazon will never be the only store.
It will always be an option for the people that know what they want.
For the people that don't know what they want, Amazon doesn't work.
And granted, for the people that I would say listen to our show, I mean, I would hope that a lot of them that are pretty knowledgeable of games that are coming out.
But if you're not, I mean, there's message boards out there.
You go, hey, you know, I'm interested in blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
You know, what games would you recommend that I play?
Dan's yelling from the living room but we can't hear him so alright let's move on we've talked like for a half hour about GameStop and that whole story last week I want to move on let's move on into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you have been playing Loki we'll start with you tonight since DarkSakura's not here how was your gaming week?
Thanks for watching!
I'm trying to remember what it was.
Vinny Vendy something.
I don't know.
It's four screens of dodging spikes.
And then you hit the top, reverse, and dodge four more screens of spikes.
It makes you want to pull your hair out.
And I just said, you know what?
Fuck it.
I know what I get for getting this.
I get the whole game upside down.
And I don't give a fuck about playing this game again.
So that's it.
I'm done with that game.
And then...
It's still a great game, though.
Thanks for watching!
Some bonus stuff I don't care about.
Whatever.
Played more Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.
I have my first character leveled up to tier 8.
My tactical guy.
And I guess I've got to start working on some of my other characters.
Like my trooper, jet, and battle character.
So, very fun game still.
And I'm hopefully going to be playing a little bit more co-op on that.
Because I haven't gotten a chance to lately.
I've been playing lots of Grand Theft Auto still.
Still fun.
Still trying to win as many games as possible so I can get my ranks up.
Because not playing for about six months dropped me about 30 ranks in the Ranked Deathmatch.
So that kind of pissed me off a little bit.
but uh nothing really I could do there it's just a lot of people um not necessarily beating me but uh played less games so if they you know have a streak of 10 or whatever it counts a lot more than what I get I have to I have to have like a streak of 30 and if I lose one it's just going back just as far so it it sucks because I played so many games um and then what else did I play um
Not much.
Downloaded my 3DS NES games.
So have those on my 3DS now.
Still haven't played them though.
I'm trying to think if I played something else on the iPod.
Nah, that's pretty much it.
Alright.
Slashpop, how was your gaming week?
Mostly World of Warcraft.
A lot of World of Warcraft.
At the Flynn's Arcade at Disneyland, I got to play R-Type in an actual stand-up machine.
Just as hard as it is on the Super NES and every other incarnation of R-Type that's ever existed.
Also, the classic, I think this may even predate Street Fighter 1 by Capcom, which was an awful game.
But Konami's, I think it's Kung Fu Master.
If anyone remembers that game, you're the little guy in the little white gi with the black belt.
Don't you mean Yara Kung Fu or something like that?
Isn't that what it's called?
Yeah, it's Konami Fighter.
I think it's Yara Kung Fu.
Yeah, and I think the very first...
um villain or combatant is like this big chunky dude bald-headed that that game um I used to play the hell out of that game at the pizza parlor when I was in junior high because you know we all played video games at pizza parlors back then um so yeah those two games were what I focused on it at Flynn's Arcade there wasn't a lot there that really you know struck stuck out to me if they had they had gauntlet and a bunch of other stuff but um
DarkSakura's Machine
Why?
Oh, that's very appropriate for her not being here.
Why Angry Birds?
I don't understand the allure of this game.
Why does America have, and I'm assuming the rest of the world too, this sick fascination with Angry Birds?
It's boring.
I don't know.
I am with you.
I've played it.
It was alright.
It was kind of neat.
Yeah, it's a physics puzzler.
And you launch birds into things and you...
I'm not obsessed about it.
I was like, eh, it was alright.
It was a cheap iPod game.
As far as these iPod games go, I like Cut the Rope, but I wouldn't buy the guy on a t-shirt.
While I was at Disneyland, I saw a ton of Angry Birds t-shirts.
They're making a fucking movie based on this.
Why?
Why?
Oh, I know why, because Hollywood's really run out of ideas.
I mean, it's like, let's make a game.
I don't know if it's in our show role, but Uwe Boll is making a movie based on some, like, a Doom clone.
No, it didn't make our show role, because I saw Uwe Boll, and I was like...
It's like some Doom clone.
It's like you would never know.
I didn't realize this obscure game is... It's basically an excuse for him to make a zombie movie.
He's like, okay, what game's a zombie thing?
Okay, I'm going to base my movie on this.
All right, but we're digressing.
So, Salacious Pop, you're playing Angry Birds right now.
Justify yourself.
Look at your life.
Look at your choices.
Yeah, I know.
It really takes just no brain power to play this game.
You have unlimited retries.
You just fling birds at shit until you kill all the pigs.
That's the whole game.
I have no room to talk.
This is a game I've been playing this week.
It didn't hit the pig when I aimed it high, so let's aim it low and try it again.
Oh, I did it.
It's now three in the morning and your iPhone is out of battery life.
I don't know.
I don't get it.
But yeah, that and also, I need to look up the name of it.
For those listening who enjoy Bust a Move or Puzzle Bobble, as it is more appropriately called, there is a clone of that game on Google Plus called Bubble.
Is that a rip off of Wurbs right there?
Um, I'm not sure.
It had monkeys in it.
What was that monster world?
That character looked hideous.
That was like a divine, but not even, like Charlie the Tuna dressed in drag.
What was that?
Like a monster world or something like that?
Alright, forget it.
It's called Bubble Island, and there's this little raccoon, and it plays exactly like Puzzle Bobble, Bust a Move.
So if you like those games and have Google+, you can't really spam the shit out of people on Google+, and also Facebook has copied that format.
It all goes to a totally separate tab.
If you want to support indie developers, all they can do is make fucking clones of really awesome games.
Just, you know, the cash in, then go right ahead.
What is that iPhone developer, Gameloft or whatever?
They thrive on ripping games off and they do it really well.
Yeah, but that's the thing.
They do it really well.
I mean, and to the point where... They fucking got wow on an iPhone.
It's pretty amazing, I gotta say.
It's sad.
It's like, you know...
It would be like having Spielberg doing remakes of something.
We have some Angry Birds defenders in our chat room at chat.org.com and every gamer does get a voice here.
Actdeft says Angry Birds is fun, not the best game ever.
Izam says Angry Birds is just something you can let your mind go numb on and waste time with.
Kaijudo says Angry Birds is the best.
We all love to knock down stuff.
Actdeft says Angry Birds is fun because of the cute destruction.
It happens in the game.
It's also like a puzzler.
So people like to knock things over.
I guess that's the allure of Jenga.
I don't know.
Alright, so Angry Birds, fine.
Anything else?
Angry Birds, wow, the two games at Flynn's Arcade and that?
Oh, um, I play your 3DS when you're at work and I'm bored.
What games on 3DS?
Metroid, Ice Climbers, Zelda 2.
Oh, the Ambassador games?
Yeah, the Ambassador games.
Were you kind of doing that thing where you'd play them for five minutes and you'd go, yep, it's Zelda, and then switch to another game?
Yeah.
Do you feel yourself needing to yell at Zelda 2?
So why is this game so damn annoying?
Dude, games like that were easier when I was 9.
Look, look, look, there it is.
Did you see that character?
What the hell was that?
Monster Island, Charlie the Tuna, Drag
Moving on, I want to talk about my gaming week, of which actually, since I was out of town, I don't have a whole lot to talk about.
Flynn's Arcade, I played Frogger, I don't know why, much to Loki's dismay, I love to play old school Frogger in an actual arcade machine.
Don't get me wrong, old school Frogger is cool, I just don't see the need of the constant remakes of Frogger.
I'm with you there.
Because they weren't good.
and I played Donkey Kong Jr.
like I've just been I don't know like I wanted to play that in the arcade hella bad and then funny you could download that on your I know ironically enough that ended up being one of the 3ds ambassador games and I played it there too and one of my whole like fun but it's funny I played it not even a day after I played the arcade version and I could really see the difference like right away not like graphically but just in how the game was a little easier on the NES than it was in the arcade that's for sure but that's yeah you can't
Like, if you fall even a little bit from one platform to a platform that's underneath you, you die.
Yeah.
You can't, there's no... Yeah, it has to be, you can do like a slight fall, but not very much.
Because I'm thinking it's like Mario, where if it's not a pit, where it just goes off the bottom of the screen, you can just jump down there, no, you die.
Nope.
Yeah.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Me and two of my friends from the Bay Area started up a game at 8 o'clock on Friday night and it was like 2.15 in the morning and we were like, oh my god, it's like after 1, we should probably go to bed, so we need to save the game.
And I don't even know if we're going to be able to recover from the save, because I couldn't save the game.
Only the host could save the game.
So I really hope we are able to restore from that save game or it's going to be very sad, but at the same time it was a lot of fun and just goes to show how freaking addicting that game was.
but um it was it was neat like I found that my two friends are very expansionistic whereas I'm more about get five cities and make them just fucking fortresses and build them up as best you can it's the year you know 1700 and they have laser beam technology or whatever yeah actually yeah we had riflemen in the year 1500 we had to end the game around like 1600 of course we were on kind of dumb dumb difficulty because we didn't want the computer to kick our ass too much so I don't know
I love Civilization and the Civilization series and Civ 5 is my favorite since the original so nothing will ever top the original to me because I'm just stuck up that way but Civ 5 is pretty freaking great and I'm having a lot of fun playing that online and I want to do that again
Any iPhone games you've been playing?
Tiny Tower, which, whatever.
Shut up.
Don't taunt me.
I will say this.
I've also been, besides Civ V and stuff, and light console stuff here and there.
Keep in mind, guys, my Xbox is still out of commission.
Remember the hack?
It's been three weeks.
I need to call Xbox tomorrow.
Where's my money?
If they're even open.
It's Labor Day.
I don't know.
So I only really have a PS3, and I was gone for most of the weeks.
That's why my gaming week was a little bit sad.
But I will say this, on Facebook, speaking of sad, I have got sucked into Sims Social.
I'm hanging my head in shame, allowing you all to judge me.
I'm shaking my head in shame.
I know.
SMH, SMH.
It's just...
it's I will say this it's a pretty darn good ripoff of The Sims and you know I think everybody got addicted to The Sims at some point not like there's definitely varying levels of difficulty but okay why are you giving a big thumbs down slash spot it was like a year maybe even two years after The Sims 1 which came out what 2000 2001 came out it it had beaten Myst as like the top selling PC game ever I played it for a weekend I did not get it
I thought it was so boring.
and of course here's the thing I think they've done a good job of translating the Sims into a Facebook game even though the whole energy thing is very limiting but what can you do the game's free you know there's got to be some limits but here's the thing I think SimSocial is also like everything you fucking hate about a Facebook game is in this game like the spam on people's walls
and ask all your friends for a cookie or whatever and all this stuff like it's just bullshit like how much this game fucks up your Facebook wall and this is why people hate Facebook games like I really want SimSocial to be on Google Plus because I don't think it will be because it can't be as invasive on Google Plus
You're grinning over there, SalaciousPop.
I have not added SimSocial to my Facebook in any way.
So I don't technically have it installed or whatever it's called.
But if I go to my games tab on Facebook, there's at least 10 people that I know very well in real life that are like, join SimSocial and send me a little fluffy pillow because I'm trying to renovate my living room and I need it for my couch.
Send me a pillow.
And I just want to say like, no.
I'll send you fire to burn down your goddamn house.
Stop bothering me.
They actually do have Fury.
Anyway.
But yeah, this is why people hate Facebook games.
It is the fastest growing game since Farmville, though.
It's the biggest.
It's going to be the biggest Facebook game since Farmville.
Guaranteed.
Don't you have to mow your lawn to earn points?
DarkSakura.com
Right?
And what was she telling us about her friend?
Like her friend is afraid to leave the house.
She was going on vacation and she had to give her daughter, because I think this was a retired aged woman, had to give her 60 or 70 year old woman.
My mom is 71.
Had to give her grown daughter her Facebook password so that her daughter could log in once or twice a day to click on all of the Farmville.
To feed her chickens.
To feed the chickens.
Or they might die.
Yeah, because she didn't want her farm to lose the progression of points when she was on vacation.
Not real chickens.
Yeah.
Farmville chickens.
I mean, that's like what these games have become to some people.
And if the chickens ever do die, she could just take out a credit card and buy $5 worth of Zynga bucks and just respawn her chickens.
That's how they make money.
Womp womp.
I'm very proud of my mother for not getting sucked into all that.
She's very staunch.
I'm not getting on Facebook.
No one wants to see my face.
I don't know if I should say this on the show.
Don't ask.
Do not ask me.
She's on Twitter.
She's got a Twitter account.
and she asked me how to upload her picture to her Twitter account and she's following like Rosie and what Cher and stuff on Twitter and it's really cute but yeah she doesn't want me I told her I would plug her Twitter and would get her some followers but she doesn't want it she doesn't she gets creeped out by people following so don't try to find her guys she doesn't want to be found so but she's on there and it's really really funny so
I'm proud of my mother for finally embracing technology because for the longest time she was one of those people that thought the CD-ROM drive was a coaster.
Why are you paying $200 for the coaster?
Anyway, let's move on then.
That's it for our gaming weeks.

Let's get into this week's gaming news After plenty of talk of last week's news and our antics this week Let's finally talk about what's going on this week Loki, start us off This weekend was the Call of Duty XP event in LA It was kind of their Call of Duty con, if you will Where they were talking about
The new Elite Service and also the Hardened Edition of Modern Warfare 3 So the first thing we're going to talk about real quick is the Hardened Edition Which thankfully this year it is only one special edition No Prestige this time around, no RC car that's way overpriced Or some cheap ass night vision goggles that really are just some toys
This time you get basically the game plus a field guide that's over 100 pages, some avatar clothes or animated theme if you're on the PlayStation Network.
Also, one year of Call of Duty Elite membership, which is apparently a $50 value, and all that's going to run you $80.
Okay.
And I have to say, I did watch at least a part of their streaming coverage of when they were talking about the multiplayer and the elite service.
And I gotta say, man, they really have got their shit together as far as how to do an online community and how to give the fans what they want for that.
It's...
It's kind of interesting because, like, you know what?
They're not going to do too bad without Infinity Ward.
I mean, the old Infinity Ward.
There's still Infinity Ward putting the game out, but it's not all the old people from Infinity Ward.
But they got their shit together as far as online computing, and that's really what's going to stand them apart from Battlefield 3.
Can you elaborate a little more?
Like, why?
Why is it so awesome?
Well, there's a bunch of stuff that they offer for free.
It's all on disc.
Basically, you can create clans.
It links in with Facebook.
You can find your friends on Facebook and be able to play games with them.
You can join up groups that are necessarily... Say, for example, I'm a fan of the Giants or something like that.
I can play with other Call of Duty players that are fans of the San Francisco Giants or whatever.
So...
Not that I'm a Giants fan.
I hate sports.
But they have that kind of stuff.
They have where you can break down.
You can see what other players' loadouts are.
Say, for example, you're playing against somebody and somebody kills you.
You can pull up all this information, all the hotspots on the map.
You can see what their loadout was.
You can try their loadout if you want.
You can create your own game modes.
You can upload those, share them with friends.
They can tweak them.
They can share them back again.
You can capture 30 second clips and post them up in HD to share with friends.
You can compete in tournaments for real prizes.
Of course, that's the paid service.
And they're going to have different tournaments based on people's skill levels.
So it's not going to be just all crazy Call of Duty elite players and stuff like that.
they also with the elite service you're going to be able to get all the download content for free and you're going to be able to get it first so they're going to put out download content every month instead of every quarter like they normally do everybody else that's not paying for the elite service or doesn't buy the hardened edition you have to pay for that separately and that's $60 if you were to buy all that on top of the membership or without the membership I guess
So, lots of, it's just, it was interesting.
And lots of different, you know, game modes, and basically just kind of, they retweaked, you know, their whole perk system and stuff like that, and it just sounded interesting.
For someone that, I'm not really into the series at all, I mean, it's just, for me, it feels like if I hadn't been playing the first one, and hadn't been playing Solid, like, you know, like I do with Grand Theft Auto, I don't really feel comfortable playing Modern Warfare 3.
Even though I probably could, it's just, you know,
Some of those players play Call of Duty like I play Grand Theft Auto.
Yeah, DDR Dollar Bill in our chatroom is with you.
I'm just not interested in the Call of Duty series.
And I'm not really into those games as well, but I can also see, I recognize that they're huge games in the industry and that, more importantly, where this succeeds, other games might follow.
Do you see something like this coming to other games in the future?
I hope so.
I would love this for Grand Theft Auto.
It would be awesome.
There's not that many people that play Grand Theft Auto multiplayer.
which I hope changes with the next one but you know whenever that may be sooner than you think I think next year for sure but I mean it would be great I would love that kind of stuff and they kind of had something sort of like that with the whole social club with Rockstar Games and stuff but it's not really in game it's more of just you go to a website and you can interact with all the stuff whereas this is actually in the game you can do all that before with Black Ops I guess you could do that
on the website but now it's actually in the game and you can do everything that you can on the website which is pretty awesome.
So yeah, I hope they do that.
As long as it delivers on what they said.
Because honestly, prior to this information, I would have said Battlefield 3 is probably going to be the better game.
And I still think they're two different types of games, but Battlefield 3 looks really good.
So if they have some decent multiplayer community features and stuff like that, it still might be...
Thanks for watching!
Um... You don't have to make a choice.
Whatever.
So some other things they talked about.
I'll go with the Elite stuff real quick.
Mobile apps.
They're going to be putting out some mobile apps so you can check out what your friends are doing and make all those tweaks and stuff on your iPod or iPhone or your Android or whatever PC.
So they're going to have that as well.
Um...
Other fun stuff.
Let's see.
Here's basically the bonuses that they're going to offer the customers.
The first, subscribers will get a year's worth of download content for Modern Warfare 3.
And they're saying it's over 20 pieces of content.
And they're going to be putting out monthly content drops instead of quarterly.
And that will include new maps, new game modes, with the value being $60.
Elite subscribers will have access to daily and weekly competitions and events, which will offer both real and virtual prizes.
Subscribers will be able to level up their clans in competition.
So that's kind of cool.
And also they'll have 8 times more video sharing capacity than standard users.
They'll have access to expert strategy and analysis including tips on guns, maps, perks, whatever.
That was one of the other things I kind of liked is you can level up your proficiencies on different weapons.
So instead of just leveling up your character, if I use like a P90 all the time I would
Elite TV Premium Service
Friday Night Fights NoobTube NoobTube
They're going to have people making commentary on them, including Will Arnett and Jason Bateman.
They're going to be smack-talking over, I guess, user-created videos from the game.
So, I mean, that's kind of cool.
That's definitely unique content, I would say.
But, you know, is it for everybody?
You know, is it for, like, someone that, you know, like me that's not really in the Call of Duty series?
Eh, probably not.
But it's definitely some stuff to kind of go, hey, that's kind of neat.
I'll have to check that out.
And a lot of this stuff was for free.
You know, you don't have to...
XBOX 360 BUNDLE
320GB hard drive also custom startup and loading disk sounds and that'll be I guess they're also going to say those controllers are also available separately for $60 and they're going to be doing a new headset which is also coming out non-branded Modern Warfare 3 for $70 that also is a Bluetooth headset those are the new Microsoft headsets
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think either you have your thing or none of it's really interesting to you.
You play a variety of games.
Like I said, $50 a year may not be your thing, especially if you're already paying for live.
That's already money out of your pocket.
A lot of the services on there are free.
So, I mean, check out at least a free portion of it because why not?
I mean, if you're playing it, it sounds like it'd be a good value.
See, but I don't really think a lot of people need expert tips or need to watch Will Arnett make fun of videos.
I mean, no one really needs that.
And the download content bonus is kind of cool because you're saving some money if you're planning on buying all the download content.
Yeah.
I mean, they're just trying to make money on the digital end because they're making a lot of money on the digital side.
And then, once again, you know, the only thing that kind of leaves a sour taste in my mouth would be, you know, the fact that this company puts it out as Activision.
So, yeah, it's like, yeah, do I really want to support Activision?
I will say, though, you know, again, I'm not really into this series, but I'm looking at the screenshot of the, you know, hardened edition.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Also of note, it sounds like this Call of Duty Expo thing was kind of a success for them too.
Oh yeah, I think so.
Definitely they'll be doing it next year.
So, very interesting.
Whatever the next game is.
Alright, well let's shift gears a little bit and talk about Nintendo.
They are doing an event of their own.
Now, you know, Nintendo does not usually participate in the Tokyo Game Show.
They don't usually go, and that's no new news.
They're not going this year either, but they are going to be doing a special press conference.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
It might be true.
Nintendo's always working on something.
All the game companies are working on something.
You bet your ass Sony's working on PlayStation 4 even though they're not showing it for five more years.
That's going to piss off a lot of people.
You think that price drop pissed off a lot of people?
Putting out a new system with six months?
With
with the holidays still to come.
I have no doubt Nintendo is working on the next 3DS model for 2012 or 2013.
I don't think it's coming out this year.
Take it from the PSP.
They're not going to add another second analog stick because now you're going to have games that are only going to work on the one system and not the old 3DS.
Well, there was talk about having an add-on that would plug in.
I don't know how it would work, but it would plug into the existing DS and give you the extra analog stick.
It could work.
I could see how they could do it.
You could plug something into the back there like where the charger usually goes and kind of have it reach...
What?
You're grinning.
That reminds me of the Logitech rumor that they were making a UMD accessory for the PlayStation Go.
That's kind of funny, huh?
I'm grinning because it reminded me of that story.
But here's the thing.
I think people are freaking out.
Nintendo doing a press conference before Tokyo Game Show is nothing new.
They do this all the time because they don't participate in Tokyo Game Show.
And what does Nintendo have going for them right now?
I already told you they're not going to show the Wii U again.
And I bet you that wasn't at PAX, was it?
I don't think so.
That's one thing I did call, right?
There's nothing to show.
They don't have anything.
It's like a proof of concept still.
Yeah, exactly.
It's too soon.
So they're not showing it now either.
And they're not taking it to a game show and it's not this.
So what else does Nintendo have going on right now?
The 3DS.
So this is probably where they're going to announce what we have to look forward to in 2012.
Whatever that might be.
I don't know.
It's probably too early to say.
But I don't think a redo of the 3DS is one of them.
now if, here's what I am here's what they could do is if it's true that they're going that direction they could announce the plug at this like whatever plug is going to give you that second analog stick, they could announce that, and if that's announced then you fucking know a new system's coming out in 2012, but I just my gut tells me no, I think they still have to really prove this, you know it's kind of like one of those, they've put it out there
Thanks for watching!
People will live.
The PSP did just fine with one analog stick.
Granted, it sucked that some games had to use the buttons to have a second analog stick.
But you know what?
We can use the touchpad as much as I hate doing it as a second analog stick.
Or just make games that don't require a second analog stick.
Gripper01 in our chatroom says, pretty assuredly, he says, it's a mother collection for the 3DS.
I wish.
I wish, my friend.
I don't think so.
Yeah, they're going to be announcing that also.
It's going to be bundled with Lastorian.
I would say so.
They're probably just going to focus on Kingdom Hearts, maybe give a date for Kid Icarus and some of the stuff we already know about.
and maybe like a new Nintendo franchise for 2012.
There right now are no dates for Kid Icarus and the two Mario games.
Well then maybe that's what we're going to hear.
We're going to get some dates finally.
I think that's what you're going to get out of this.
And maybe a teaser of some Nintendo franchise coming back on the DS in 2012.
F-Zero Actraiser 3
Thanks for watching!
They came out the night before they were supposed to, and I think that's because it was the first in Japan, but it was like the 31st of August here.
And the full list of games that you can get for free, NES games, Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong Jr., Balloon Fight, Ice Climber, Legend of Zelda, Metroid, NES Open Tournament Golf, Wrecking Crew, Yoshi, and Zelda II, The Adventure of Link.
Those are the games that came out.
Yoshi, by the way, is not Yoshi's cookie, but it's a different puzzler.
It's kind of crap.
It's the one where Mario was on the bottom and you can flip the things around and you line up the characters and little Yoshi eggs.
It's bad.
I played it.
I was like, ooh, this was not a good puzzler game.
They kept trying to, it's like, they had really good success with Tetris and then Dr. Mario back to back.
Isn't it a Columns clone and Columns isn't very good either?
I guess it's kind of like Columns, but not really.
Mario's at the bottom and he flips these platters around and that's what you're doing.
But I don't know.
I don't want to talk too much about Yoshi.
It's not worth your time.
They really should have just done Dr. Mario.
See, but you have five, I would say in that list, you have like five epic Nintendo games.
Mario Brothers, Zelda, Zelda 2, Metroid, and out of Donkey Kong Jr., Balloon Fight, and Ice Climber, probably one of those you go, that's epic too.
Some of these speak to your interest.
And then the rest of those, stinkers.
But, you know, whatever.
Again, I still to this day say Nintendo really didn't have to do anything.
So for them, I mean, when you early adopt, this is the risk you take.
And so I think it's neat that the games are out and that I didn't have to pay for them.
And I look forward to the advanced games as well.
But having Metroid in my pocket is kind of rad, not going to lie.
It's kind of nice.
Looking forward to seeing how that multiplayer and all that stuff pulls out because it might make a game like Ice Climber way more fun to be able to actually play that.
Are they adding that later on?
I think so.
They were supposed to be doing that for the NES.
Same room, multiplayer.
But no longer with the chords that you had on the Game Boy old school and all that.
and then of course as I already mentioned there are rumors about a redesigned 3DS it's coming from a French website 01.net and normally you would write that off as oh well who cares it's just some website doesn't know what they're talking about however I believe this is the same website that talked about what else did they blow the lid on before they broke the Wii U and they broke the PS Vita and those specs
So it's kind of one of those, they were right on these, so take this or leave this.
But that's where the whole rumor of the second stick comes from.
The second analog stick rumor for the PSP original plagued that console for years and years.
There were leaked photos, and they were all fake.
I can see them doing it if they want to do an XL or something like that.
That doesn't piss me off.
Big deal.
So it has a larger screen.
I'll get over that.
But the change is so much to where, oh, we're going to put a second analog.
Come on, that's going to piss people off.
Yeah, it's like the expression, you've made your bed, now lie in it.
Final Fantasy XIV, they're not just coming out with a new game.
Yeah, I mean, it's just like, well, shouldn't this have been part of the... It's just like, it's not as bad as like Wii Motion Plus or something like that, but it is pretty bad.
It's like, yeah, we really should have had these extra sensors in there, but we want to drop the cost of this.
But now we're just like...
and we're gonna fuck you guys so um what made them change their mind though if this is true I still I still I mean I realize this website has a record and so forth you know people have said the same thing about us like why believe them when we were right on something early but um
I don't know.
There's still a big grain of salt I'm taking this with.
But I feel like, well, why would they suddenly change their mind?
Maybe it's developer pressure?
Maybe because the lack of games... There's been a lack of games in the beginning here.
Maybe it's because they're worried they're not going to be able to port the hardcore games over some of these first-person shooters or whatever.
Like a Call of Duty.
Modern Warfare 3 is not going to be able to be on that because...
We're not going to be sitting here after Christmas going, there's a lack of games on the 3DS.
How could you be?
You have Mario Kart, Mario, Kid Icarus, all coming out by the end of the year.
And a bunch of third party stuff.
Those are pretty strong games, and it's going to be enough for the 3DS.
Granted, it should have been what the system launched with, but whatever.
3DS is going to be in a much better position come December than it is currently.
You know what I mean?
I feel like there's no games for 3DS.
That argument's going to get old at the end of the year.
And it's going to be difficult to... I wouldn't think that they would announce a revision to their system right before the holiday.
Yeah, that would be shooting yourself in the foot, for real.
That would be just dumb of them to do.
But again, like I said a minute ago, they could be working on that, and this French website might be right, but that doesn't mean that's what they're announcing before the Tokyo Game Show.
Nintendo always does a press conference before the Tokyo Game Show because they don't participate.
I'll tell you what they're doing.
They're doing some sort of bundle.
It's like, oh, look, it's a Mario console with Mario.
Okay, yeah.
I mean, that makes sense.
I'm with you.
Yeah, absolutely.
Didn't they already announce something like that?
They announced a red console.
Yeah, a bundle.
Makes sense.
Perfect sense.
And I think there will be a tease of a new game in 2012.
Yeah.
We still have that Smash Brothers game.
I want to play.
And this is weird.
I want to play that Lego City Stories.
I don't fucking care if it's made by Rockstar Games, I'll play that shit.
Alright, fair enough.
By the way, we have some comments in our chatroom going back to talking about the games that were in the Ambassador Pack.
Let's see, Balloon Fight.
Actdeft says, Balloon Fight is awesome.
And SonicM88 says, I love Balloon Fight.
And Orange Right says, Balloon Fight is only good for balloon trips.
There's a lot of love for Balloon Fight in the chat and some in the middle of the road.
But yeah, Balloon Fight, if you've never played it, is basically Nintendo's joust ripoff.
You know Joust, the game where you flap the little birdie?
It's like that, but with balloons.
But yeah, what made the game stand out was that it had this mode called Balloon Trip, where now imagine Joust as a side-scrolling game.
That's what Balloon Trip is.
Except it scrolls the wrong way, too, which is interesting.
It scrolls the other way.
But I think it's neat.
Alright, so let's move on with some more news.
Slash Pop!
Take Two Interactive Employee
which is based in California and basically saying he worked overtime didn't get paid for it doesn't really say how he left the firm whether if he was laid off fired or quit but he says that there's a lot of unpaid wages
Oh to him and other people in the QA department that he's trying to get together for the class action suit.
Also in the state of California, they're very strict on if you work eight hour days, you have to get a 30 minute lunch.
Like by law, legally, they have to give you that.
And also breaks, 15 minute breaks every couple of hours.
He's also saying, he's saying that they basically said too bad, so sad for you.
You don't get those lunches and breaks because of crunch time where they had to get a game out the door.
Um,
So I guess the QA department was ridden really hard, and he's trying to sue them for the fact that they had that department run with no lunches or breaks and had people who weren't salaried, they were hourly employees, not getting paid for their overtime.
And he started working there in December of 2006.
It doesn't say when he left the firm.
And the case, the original complaint was filed in June of 2010, so this is already a little over a year old.
but legal things are always so slow they always go at a snail's pace and it looks like it hasn't been thrown out or anything so this may actually go to trial he's trying to scrounge up multiple people to both strengthen his case and also to get the class action thing going
I kind of hope it does go to trial because I feel like I've got nothing else to say on this because I'm not in this dude's shoes.
And this is one of those cases where I think there's three sides to every story, right?
Your side, my side, and the truth, right?
And so I kind of want something like this to go to trial just so we can kind of hear.
I know we always hear those horror stories in the industry about these claims he's making totally seems legit based on other things we've heard from other companies.
When I worked in a call center, when we had, you know, like in a call center, your company has these service level agreements, like you won't be on hold for more than two minutes, all that bull crap.
Our wait times were like 40 minutes.
So our metrics were a total chit show.
And I was working 10 hour days.
And basically they said, we're going to put you down for a 30 minute lunch.
But if you could only make it 20 minutes,
eat fast and you know could you do that because we're really short on call coverage you know that's the kind of shit that they pull in real sweatshop environments like a QA center where you've got all of these testers trying to get a product out the door because it has to go gold in a certain amount of time basically what I'm saying is I've experienced that first hand where I've worked at a job where management was like can you eat at your desk while working also
This is such a tricky scenario because you do want to say, you know, yeah, stick it to the man, stick it to the corporation and so forth.
And these things should be fair.
But then you kind of also look at the other hand and go, well, they'll probably just turn around and outsource this to another country because that's unfortunately where a lot of these jobs are going.
And I don't want to get too political and so forth.
But, I mean, that's just the world we're in right now.
You know what I mean?
and we've even heard of QA jobs being outsourced and so forth.
At the same time, I don't think that it's right that somebody has to not claim time or not say the accurate time they worked or what have you but
I think there needs to be better foresight in the planning of games.
And it's, oh, shock and awe, mismanagement in all of these cases, right?
Mismanagement, bad staffing planning, bad, you know, what a shocker.
Well, yeah, it's because the managers that are managing these employees probably get paid on how early the game is done and they get a bonus based on that.
So they want their bonus to be big because it's all about their pocket money.
and people fear that if they don't comply, you know, and Salacious Pop, when you were in that situation, what were you going to do?
Tell them no?
well in my case when I had to work the mandatory overtime I was paid for it but um yeah it's like this is really shitty and I want to walk out of this building for 30 minutes and clear my head um but I can't because they're basically telling me that I don't get a lunch but I got rent to pay I gotta pay bills and I'm not just gonna flip them off and quit your job will end up overseas if you don't do it yeah so and that's like that's that's the real problem
Is there an easy answer?
I don't know.
But I guess the fact that this guy is making such a big complaint, it sounds like this is a pretty widespread, you know, supported by management abuse of an entire department rather than, you know, an ugly week where they had to do sketchy things.
It sounds like this was just really, or at least the case that he's trying to present is that they, you know, it was run, the QA department was run very terribly.
Based on how long we've been doing this show, or how long you all have been listening, and the stories we read week in and week out about what happens in the gaming world, does this lawsuit surprise anybody?
Anyone surprised?
Why not?
just comes with the industry.
Exactly.
But does that make it right?
No.
Well, also, so he's an ex-Take-Two Interactive employee.
The division that he was in is now called Visual Concepts, formerly 2K Sports, that had all the Sega sports licenses.
So I can imagine in that QA environment, if EA's BS, they're putting out the new Madden or whatever,
They need to get their game out in time for what EA is doing.
So basically all of the sports games that Take-Two has put out since 2006, those are the games that would have been affected by this QA department.
So I could definitely see how if Madden comes out and your game is supposed to come out a week before and you don't make your gold pressing of it, then that's money down the drain.
Well, let's see it go to trial.
I want to see this case defended.
I want to see what happens.
For once, can we not settle out of court and let's do it the good old American way and waste taxpayer monies on an actual courtroom trial lawsuit because this is something I would like to see how this plays out.
But it'll get settled.
They all do.
Unless this guy's totally full of crap and he doesn't have the documentation, he gets left out of court.
It very well could be.
And we just don't know.
But I think it says something that we look at this and we go, yeah, not too surprising, right?
I mean, so I think we're kind of saying, well, this doesn't sound like it's full of shit.
I mean, it could be in this case.
We don't know this guy.
This guy could just be a bitter Betty, but we don't know.
That's why it has to go to trial so we can find out.
Anyway, let's move on with more gaming news.
Oh yeah.
We thought it was going to be a short show tonight.
We're already an hour and a half into part A. Anyhow.
We'll go quick.
You watch.
So Sony is talking smack about Microsoft.
Are they not?
Basically, there is a recent interview concerning Microsoft's publishing policies.
Basically, the thing that he was pissed off about was Microsoft's content submission and release policy, which forbids its games from being released first or with exclusive content on other platforms.
So for example, titles for Xbox 360 must ship at least simultaneously with other video game platforms and must have at least feature and content parity on disc with other video game platform versions in all regions where the title is available.
If these conditions are not met, Microsoft reserves the right to not allow content to be released on the Xbox 360.
It's actually interesting for a few reasons because I know for a fact, like, was it Dead Space 2 and stuff?
They had, you know, content that was on the Blu-ray version of, you know, for the PS3, and that wasn't on the 360 version.
We didn't get that.
It was the HD remake of Dead Space, the Wii one that they had, you know, the on-rails shooter one.
Oh, yeah.
They had that.
And then also, I believe...
I want to say Battlefield 3 might have something.
There's like the original Battlefield 1942 I think was supposed to be on one of the discs.
It's a lot of EA games that'll do that where they'll have exclusive thingies.
But we don't know if this is really true or not, right?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think what Chris and other representatives of Microsoft are doing is protecting inferior technology.
This is according to Rob Dyer again.
I think they want to dumb it down and keep it as pedestrian as possible so that if you want to do anything on Blu-ray or if you have extra content above 9 gigs or you want to do anything of that nature, you better sure as heck remember that Microsoft can't handle that.
I'm just bickering wow it's almost like the exact same story that Salacious Pop just read except this time it's not the manager it's Microsoft using their pull to strong arm developers to get what they want because they're out there in the marketplace more than Playstation but see here's where I kind of question this whole thing I have a big question mark about this not just the examples you gave but Japan Microsoft can't get away with this in Japan no how could they possibly no
and maybe even Europe.
I don't know what the sales numbers look like in Europe, but I think America's the only place where the Xbox really dominates the PS3 and that gap is closing.
I think it's important to note too.
So this might be Microsoft's way to kind of make sure that the Xbox doesn't die, but it's going to have the reverse effect, isn't it?
Like I look at this and go, this is just dumb.
If this is already in effect, I don't think it's really hurting them any.
I don't know.
It's just... But if Sony were to do the same thing, who loses?
The consumer?
Well, that's what... Here's what you just do then.
It's pretty simple.
And they've already done this.
You put out free download content.
You put a voucher in the game and you get free download content on PlayStation 3.
It falls within all that.
No!
Here's what you do.
You make your game for the PlayStation 3 and fuck the 360.
I mean, if that's...
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
and you can still market it as an exclusive I'm not trying to come off as a Sony fanboy either because I do love a lot of what Microsoft's done with Xbox I mean obviously Xbox Live Arcade is something everybody's trying to copy now Xbox Live, set the bar and so forth granted I liked Microsoft a lot more before my account was hacked for $125 and I haven't been able to play for three weeks but I digress
Rage
Rage is on one Blu-ray on the PlayStation 3.
Rage is on three to four DVDs on the Xbox 360.
That sucks.
It's not a big deal.
I don't give a shit about this.
I don't give a shit.
Final Fantasy XIII was on several DVDs.
Didn't really change the game.
Lost Odyssey, yeah.
Wasn't it the Atlus game Catherine that came out?
There isn't room on a 360 disc for the Japanese...
Dialogue with English subtitles.
So because they can't fit it on the 360 version, they took it off of the PS3 version.
Is that right?
Or else the 360 version, what's it going to sell it?
I don't think so.
Because, I mean, I've seen, you know, ISO rips of that.
And Catherine's not that big a gain.
It's like, it's four or five gigs.
I mean, they've got room.
But I just think they just didn't bother much.
sometimes they just don't put the extra language track in there I mean a lot of video games don't put the Japanese language tracks in sometimes fighting games and so forth do but you know the speech in that is very short but you know most role-playing games out there don't and I know Catherine's not an RPG but most RPGs don't bother with the second track it's actually kind of really cool when they have it there you know and you can play in either language but very rare right
So, anyway, I guess we'll see if this kind of holds out to be... I want to say if it holds out to be true, but I guess we are hearing it is kind of fact, but you have some cases where it's not, so...
Yeah, I mean, I don't know when this went to effect, if it's just something that they just now put out.
But all I know is, like, I know that there's been titles, and I think there's some that haven't come out yet.
Actually, I know another perfect example.
For, was it...
and of course now the titles have disappeared.
Bioshock Infinite is going to have the first Bioshock game on disc for the PlayStation 3 version.
Not so much on the 360 because they have the extra space for that.
I want to say it was Battlefield 1942.
I'm not sure if that was on the PlayStation 3 version of Battlefield 3, but one of these games that was coming out had another game on the disc because they have so much space.
Microsoft's got to be a little worried because for the first time,
in this whole generation of games where it's been PS3 versus Xbox.
We were hearing a lot more favorable things about the PlayStation 3 back in May.
It was in May when Portal 2 and Mortal Kombat came out.
Most people opted to get those games on the PlayStation 3.
And that was really the first time you were hearing that because you had an extra character on the PlayStation 3 version, Kratos, right, of Mortal Kombat.
and when it came to Portal 2 you had the whole Steam integration and a free copy on the PC.
I mean, which wasn't even remotely close to what the 360 could offer.
And again, I'm not trying to dog on 360.
360 has proven the better system than PlayStation 3 in some cases.
But I think now it's getting to a point where Xbox can't just kind of rest on their laurels of, well, we were the cheaper system for so long that more people have Xboxes in their houses than they do PlayStations because that gap is slowly closing.
At the end of the day, it's going to be the games that speak for themselves.
It's going to take developers, if these rules are true, standing up to these rules and saying...
forget it, we can survive as a Playstation 3 exclusive, it worked for Demon's Souls it worked for, you know whatever other first party Sony games are out there 3D Dot Game Heroes and so forth so Kaijudo in chat says L.A.
Noire wouldn't have so much DLC if they ran it on Playstation 3 only yeah, maybe sometimes the DLC is part of the whole plan we're gonna get you to pay 60 bucks and then another 20 pay to unlock exactly, pay to unlock content
All right, quickly, let's talk about a Wii game.
That's right, a new Wii game.
More information coming out on it tonight.
Square Enix is going to be revealing more information about Dragon Quest on Ustream at 2 p.m.
Japan time, September 5th.
That's 10 o'clock Pacific tonight.
So in about two hours, they'll be starting that event.
Who knows?
We might still be live at this pace tonight.
but they're probably going to be showing more information on Dragon Quest X although it could be a new announcement they announced a long time ago some of you forgot Dragon Quest X is going to be coming on the Wii they said that back in 2008 but they have yet to show off anything about the game
It's going to be interesting to see if they stick to their guns and they put this game out on the Wii relatively late in the Wii's life cycle because they would have to announce this and really have a date ready to go relatively soon.
I worry it's going to suffer a little bit from what Dragon Quest VIII suffered from.
VIII was on the PS2, right?
Towards the end.
VIII was on the PS2 at the very, very end and it's the same thing that hurt Final Fantasy XII.
both those games came out I don't think very far apart from each other and both those games you know for the hardcore gamer got overlooked a little bit because everybody was putting 360s and Wii's in their homes and so forth or excuse me just 360s and other new stuff 7 was PS1 right?
so they've been really like those games don't haven't really come out as often as they used to
No, and the Dragon Quest IX was on the DS, obviously, and now X was announced some time ago on the Wii.
Because for a while there, especially back in 2008, it seemed like the Wii was everything.
It's going to be interesting to see if they've stuck to that, or if maybe one of the announcements we're getting today is...
and it might show up on other systems.
I kind of don't think they'll do that.
Keep in mind, Dragon Quest is still a very Japanese-centric game.
Dragon Quest IX, everyone went clown shit for that game in Japan and over here, people that know what Dragon Quest is bought it, but it wasn't the phenomenon that it was over there.
I bet your ass it's not coming out on Xbox.
Period.
It's a Japanese game and Xbox is not what it is here.
PlayStation 3?
Ah!
I just don't think so I don't think they have a need to maybe Dragon Quest XI probably not Dragon Quest X well I mean different studio obviously but the 360 did have Blue Dragon which was by Mistwalker Studio and also the artwork was Akira Toriyama who did Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Quest so there's that connection there it wouldn't be unheard of if it came out on the 360 because we've had a game that looks like it already true true
All right, so we'll see what happens.
By the time most of you are hearing this on the podcast, actually, we'll have more information on that.
So be looking for that on Labor Day.
By the way, just real quick, there is going to be a Dragon Quest X trailer in the Wii Anniversary Collection.
I mean, this just really strengthens that, yes, they're committed to the Wii.
I don't know if you've heard but they are bundling I think it's 1, 2, 3 and the Super Nintendo remakes of 1 and 2 are all going to be on a Wii Anniversary disc it's very it's like that Mario collection they did it's like that for Dragon Quest which is cool but it won't be out in the US to be fair though it's still more content that was on that fucking Mario disc hey at least you know what they put more than one game on there guess what Nintendo you could have done that those discs
They can hold more than a Super NES ROM.
Well, it's just 1, 2, and 3.
I would have loved to see that rip.
1 meg!
It's like, okay.
Waste of a disc.
I wish that anniversary collection would come out in the US, actually.
I really love the first Dragon Quest game.
Dragon Warrior.
Remember?
So...
Alright, anyhow.
That is coming out by the time most of you guys hear this, so look for it.
Salacious Pop.
A couple weeks ago we reported on a story about the Video Game History Museum project and how they were trying to get the money they needed to get the thing off the ground.
The Video Game History Museum is, I think it sounds like it's just three or four dudes that are running this and they usually have an exhibit at the Classic Gaming Expo in Las Vegas where they would have floor space for their video game history pieces and all the information there.
And they really wanted to give this thing a
Thanks for watching!
uh Eidos and so that's that's where it's going to be and their Kickstarter was a success and the story is that they are $20,000 over what they initially wanted um I got the oh I had the Kickstarter page open but I closed it uh but it's like I think they had 700 donors and the target goal was $30,000 on their Kickstarter page and now they're at 50 something so yeah um
no real update yet as to you know whether like what what the building's gonna look like or if they actually have a space for it like bought if they're gonna buy the plot to build it on but yeah they made their money so hopefully within maybe a couple years we'll have a permanent video game hall of fame slash history museum in California for us to go to
Well, I remember kind of reporting on this a couple weeks ago, and it sounded kind of cool at the time.
So I'm glad they kind of got their kinks worked out and what have you.
So what do you say, road trip?
Actually, I've seen their exhibit at Classic Gaming Expo before, and it's pretty cool.
So I think it's neat that they're kind of going to have a place for this.
If you go to their Kickstarter page, which I can find and post into chat, there are certain landmarks.
If you donate $10, $20, $50 and so on, there are perks that you get once the museum is a reality.
Like a ticket to admission or something like VIP ticket to get in first before everyone else or whatever.
Creative.
Most Kickstarter pages are like that.
Right, right.
All right.
Well, let's go around the world and check out some release dates and see what is coming out in a country near you.
Hello and welcome to the fourth quarter.
We have lots of stuff for you.
Yeah, I know it's not technically the fourth quarter of the year, but you know what?
No one really counts December.
It's on after Labor Day.
It is on.
That's when Michaels is going to start rolling out the Christmas decorations.
That's when, you know, it's on.
And as far as the game industry cares, it is the fourth quarter.
So let's start off.
Get Fit with Mel B coming out on the Wii.
It's a game that's been delayed for God knows how long.
Come on, I thought you said it was the fourth quarter.
Well, there's crap in the fourth quarter.
Dead Island coming out on... Mel B just had another baby.
She's going to need to play her own game.
Dead Island is coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
and PC this week.
Challenge Me Word Puzzles on the DS, Junior Mystery Stories on the DS, Penguins in Madagascar, Dr. Blowhole Returns again.
That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and the DS.
Resistance 3 on the PlayStation 3 this week.
Driver Renegade on the 3DS.
Driver San Francisco on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii this week.
No PC yet.
PC got delayed to the end of the month.
I really want to see how fast their DRM gets cracked.
They're doing an Uncharted dual pack on the PlayStation 3, the first and second game, with some download content thrown in for $39.99.
That's kind of cool.
Rise of the Nightmares, the first M-rated Kinect game.
It's by the guys that did the House of the Dead series.
And that's on Xbox 360.
Disgaea 4, A Promise Unforgotten on PlayStation 3.
And let's see here, Junior Island Adventure.
Slash Pop, did you know that was coming out?
Are you a Disgaea fan?
Yeah, I don't have 3 yet, so I'm behind.
But I have 1 and 2 on PSP.
Ah.
Tiger Woods on PC Warhammer 40k Space Marine on PS3, Xbox 360, PC Flame Red Nintendo 3DS Star Fox 64 3D It's definitely looking busier this week than it was last week.
Alright, moving over to Japan and looking at the Japanese releases.
On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week on the 8th of September, Biohazard Revival Selection.
Of course, Biohazard is their name for Resident Evil.
Get this, it's Code Veronica and Resident Evil 4 on one disc for the 360.
It's pretty cool, huh?
I believe PS3 has a version of that as well, so that's pretty neat, especially if you kind of missed out on those games.
Also in Japan this week, Daysex, Human Revolution on 360, Rise of Nightmares as well.
That's a Sega game coming out in Japan this week on the 360.
Not sure if this is a port of something we have over here.
I'm trying to look at the screenshots real quick, but it's definitely a survival horror game with scary-ass clown-looking people and all that.
Does that art look familiar to anyone?
That's something that's here.
Oh, it's a Kinect game.
That's Rise of the Nightmare.
Oh, I didn't know.
That's something that's out here, really?
Yeah, it's coming out next week.
I told you, the first mature rated Kinect game.
Oh.
It's very bloody.
It's got evil clowns.
Yes, it does.
Alright, well, Japan gets that game as well.
So that's on the 360.
Then going to the PlayStation 3 and seeing what's coming out there.
We have Disgaea 4 makes its way.
I'm sorry.
That's a U.S.
state sneaking its way in there.
Biohazard Revival Selection also comes out on the PlayStation 3 on September 8th.
Deus Ex Human Revolution there as well.
Minano Golf 5 gets a move version that comes out this week.
That's what?
Hot Shots Golf, right?
Yeah.
And it gets a price reduction overall.
There is a new console which comes with Tales of Zillia.
Comes out from Namco Bandai.
This is the newest game in their Tales of series.
It is written and designed specifically for the PlayStation 3.
They're doing a console bundle to support that in Japan.
So pretty big week.
Resistance 3 also finally getting its release in Japan this week.
Moving on to some of the handhelds.
um trying to look at the PSP dates here Ace Combat X2 gets a price reduction this week otherwise nothing really big on the PSP this week uh trying to look really quickly at the Wii Super Sentai Battle Ranger Cross from Namco Bandai and lastly on the 3DS there's really nothing until the 22nd
All right.
How about the UK, Alan?
In the UK, we have Resistance 3 on the PS3.
We have Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 The Masters on Mac and PC.
Blood Rain Betrayal on the PS3.
Crimson Alliance on the 360.
A game by Konami called Leadmes, if I'm saying that right.
L-E-D-M-E-E-S for the 360.
I clicked on the link for it, and they don't have...
It's an Xbox Live Arcade game.
No content on the page I was looking at other than that the publisher is Konami.
It's also a Kinect game.
Dead Island on PC, PlayStation 3, and the 360.
El Shaddai Ascension of the Metatron on the PS3 and the 360.
Rise of Nightmares, the game we were just talking about on the Kinect, also arriving in the UK on the 9th for the 360.
That's it.
Actdeft says the American version of the game is 13.31 megabytes.
Great waste of over 4,000 megabytes on a goddamn DVD.
Seriously.
Dual layer.
Don't forget some games like Mario Galaxy and Xenoblade are dual layer.
They should have put on a dual layer just to be extravagant.
that disc right there has so little on it you can literally put your fingers and rub it all over the disc and it would be just fine you know what you could do is if you were into the backup quote unquote you know what I'm saying you could do a GameCube sized disc and put the ROM on that and load it off a GameCube disc but with the Wii Note it was a Wii disc
I don't know.
It's just that's pathetic is what it is.
They really should just release that.
You're mad.
Why are you mad though?
And then lastly, let's see.
Cyber Beast is talking about I really need the Nyko or Nyko Zoom.
That's the whole thing on the Kinect.
Yeah, I got delayed.
It's supposed to be coming.
Well, it would have been out already if it was coming out in time, but it's September now.
Well, and Japan's getting it.
And I want one too.
I think so many people are interested in that.
And by the way, if you haven't heard of that, that's the thing that you can actually put on your Kinect.
And it will help a smaller room be more effective with the Wii.
It's basically like a wide-angle lens, basically, for your Kinect.
The Kinect.
And it's a great idea.
And I wonder if Microsoft isn't going to just kind of change the Kinect because it seems like this is so badly needed, you know?
So we'll see.
Alright, anyhow, let's move on with a couple more quick stories for you guys.
Loki.
Avalanche, the developers behind the Just Cause series, they have some comments regarding DRM.
They believe it's a threat to the entertaining experience.
Basically, what was it, uh...
Christopher Sundberg said,
I don't like always on DRM solutions at all since they offer nothing to the consumer if you continuously give something extra for registering and being online and award them for actually paying for and playing your game it'd be different but always on DRM says thank you for buying our game we trust you as far as we can throw you
And yeah, that kind of makes sense.
And I love how Ubisoft likes to spin it.
No, you would have had multiplayer in there anyways, but you're being a dick.
That's what it is.
You just don't want people, you know, to be on your online service if they didn't buy the game new.
Whatever.
I just, it's stupid.
Well, isn't it true that when all this DRM stuff, the person that loses is the people that are buying these games legitimately?
Exactly, and I'm very curious, and I will definitely be reporting on that, how quickly the DRM gets cracked on Driver.
It will be fast, I guarantee it.
All right.
Well, before we get to the classic game of the week tonight, we have a new segment here on Orange Lounge Radio because, you know, we just see too many news stories that are like this, and so we just need to give it its own segment on the show, and it's called Local News Making Gamers Look Bad.
Local News Making Gamers Look Bad
That's right.
Local news making gamers look bad.
And for tonight's local news making gamers look bad, we're going to go to the station WSB TV Channel 2.
And where are they located?
They're in Georgia, but I don't think they're in Atlanta station.
I think they're like northern Georgia.
We're going to get to a story that they ran this week that captured some of the gaming blogs about pornographic drawings that were found inside a used Wii game.
And I know what you're thinking.
This isn't really a news story.
This makes it on the news?
No, this is the whole point of this segment.
It's local news making gamers look bad.
So yes, it does have to do with gaming because it's your local news station.
Oh, it is an Atlanta station.
It's
Action News 2 in Atlanta.
Oh, if Bobby had had a show tonight, he would have been all over this.
This is in his backyard.
This is in, by the way, the town.
And remember this in the back of your mind.
Cumming, Georgia.
And that's C-U-M-M-I-N-G.
Like, I'm cumming, right?
That's exactly where this story takes place.
So here we go.
Portographic drawings from Action News 2 in Atlanta.
and a six-year-old boy found pornographic drawings inside the box of a Nintendo Wii game.
The packaging says it's suitable for everyone.
Channel 8's Napier Viteri is live tonight in Forsyth County with the discovery parents were not prepared to explain.
Amy?
And I apologize for the audio is very, very low on this.
I might have to fix it in post-production a little bit.
But again, the local internet news is very not good at equalizing their audio.
So, sorry.
Jovita, Tracy Turner bought her six-year-old son this game at a local GameStop.
It says on the outside of the box, rated E for everyone.
But what he found inside is for mature adults only.
Let's find this one.
Tracy Turner has a stack of kid-friendly video games for six-year-old JT and four-year-old Madison.
The kids are cute.
I'm not going to talk bad about the kids.
It's cute that they do have these Wii games that they play.
By the way, the game they're showing, I don't know why they don't name it.
This is kind of like when the local news here did the story on us and then never named our station.
Remember that?
They were doing the story on podcasting and they interviewed us, but they never said it was Orange Launch Radio.
They just said, these are three local guys that do podcasts about video games.
Never named it.
The game that they're looking at here is Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games.
My favorite part is that they show, and I realize it's a radio show, but they're showing...
Parts of the picture are cropped, but they're very cropped.
So it just looks like these happy little faces and somebody does have some artistic talent here.
It looks like someone just drew stick figures with a giant dong or something on it with a Sharpie marker.
Exactly, exactly.
Not prepared to answer the questions of what was going on in the picture, so...
Turner tells me she called GameStop to let them know what was included in their merchandise.
She says an employee thanked her for calling and hung up.
She even called the corporate office but tells me she got the same response.
That's bonus content, okay?
You should be thanking us.
Oh, well, didn't you know GameStop has the exclusive with Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games?
You get free wiener picks with every purchase.
Do you know how much sex goes on at the Olympics in real life?
I'll have you know that we should charge you extra for those wiener picks.
Wow, this is investigative journalism.
And I love this shot of the reporter walking in the GameStop.
Like, I'm going to go march on in there and get to the bottom of what happened here.
to the same employee who took Turner's call.
She says no one apologized, that you just said thanks for letting us know and then hung up.
I also called the corporate office and someone told me they would get back to me.
These compelling shots of the reporter on her iPhone, like I'm calling them right now and I'm looking very intently at the phone.
I just wanted them to say I'm sorry.
I got an email from GameStop's corporate office this evening asking me for Turner's information so they can look into what happened further.
As for Turner, she tells me from now on she's going to buy new games, spend a few more dollars so she can avoid this happening again.
We're live in Forsyth County.
Amy Napier-Viteri, Channel 2 Action News, Nightbeat.
That's it.
It's propaganda.
Propaganda from the developers and the publishers of these games.
They're just trying to get people to think, you know what, if I buy used, I'm going to get fucking dick pics in my games.
Buy new.
No dick pics in new games.
Here's the thing.
I'm not making fun of the mother because she has a legitimate complaint.
Yes.
She really does.
I mean, the fact that it's on the fucking news in Atlanta is a little weird to me.
Like, okay.
But let's be real.
It's probably one of those things where she went to GameStop.
She got kind of like...
Well, thanks!
They do help out, like, you know, in cases of... This isn't one of those cases that really need... It's like, yeah, that's unfortunate, but... But this is just a seized opportunity, I mean, for the local news station.
This is really... Okay, look, look.
What did she want?
She wanted GameStop to fucking say, sorry about that, man.
Like, any of us in the GameStop employees' shoes, you know what to say.
I'm really sorry to hear about that, ma'am.
If you wouldn't mind bringing the game back to the store, we'll get you a full refund or we'll get you a replacement copy.
Dan, you're shaking your head.
You disagree.
Get Dan a mic.
You disagree that the woman... We would have just laughed at her.
We would have been like, you got a game with drawings in it.
You're stupid.
You know damn well that's not what you would have done.
I would have actually copped to drawing him.
Would you have done it in a humorous way, though?
No, I don't know.
I would have had her... If she was mad, I would have just told her to bring the game back.
Exactly.
Thank you, Dan.
You bring the game back and we'll replace the game or give your money back.
Oh, no, I wouldn't have replaced the game.
I just would have wanted to see what was done on the inside of the cover.
Come on.
Yes, you would.
You'd replace the game and or give her money back.
I'd give her a different manual.
It's a used game anyway.
Like, fucking GameStop makes hella money on those games.
You could have afforded to give them one way or the other.
That's added value.
That's like a Deus Ex coupon, but better.
Alright, you're not helping, Dan.
No, I never help.
Alright, but to be honest, and now it's on the local news because she didn't get that apology or that reaction that any one of us with a shred of customer service in us knows that she should have had.
Just an apology.
So it sounds like the GameStop employee that obviously looked at the back of the disc to make sure it was scratched when they took the trade in failed to notice the...
PP Drawings on the inside cover that the previous owner drew in there when he wanted to get his five bucks used credit.
Which, you know, okay, wake up call.
Maybe GameStop needs to be thumbing through those pages.
I mean, I wouldn't have thought to, oh, I better look through the manual to make sure no one drew a dick in here.
You know?
And to be fair, the person who probably drew it probably forgot it was in there.
Like, if you do something stupid before, usually before you sell a game back, like, remember back when it was cartridges, and like, if you name your character cunt, like, you're gonna erase, you're gonna have the courtesy probably to erase that file before you sell it.
Alright, some of you won't.
Yeah, you get a game from Blockbuster, and it's like boobs, butts, turd.
It's like Oregon Trail, but you just name your Final Fantasy 6 characters after it.
And I'm sorry, you know, they're like,
How old is 6 and 4?
Maybe they wouldn't know what's really going on.
But I would have been like, that's funny.
But here's my point, guys, is that this really isn't a big issue.
The woman has a legitimate complaint.
A manager needs to spank an associate at the front line of GameStop here and this could be done, Dan.
But it doesn't need to be on the fucking news.
Gamers are dirty-ass people, though.
and that's what this new story is conveying gamers are all sex crazed maniacs who draw peepees in Mario and Sonic Mario's got a peepee it gets way better than that I can't even tell you the amount of times I was pulling in a system for trade and I popped open the disc drawer and there was porn in it it was a lot
and not like, you know, fake porn either.
Like real fucking hardcore porn and you're just like, really pal?
You couldn't have like opened it up and pulled your, you know, your disc out and put it away.
How many did that just to get a reaction out of you though?
No, no, it was like people, they were always like, holy fuck.
I can't believe, oh my god, you know, you'd give them the disc, you'd wipe off their hands.
I swear to god I opened a disc once, a CD case, and there was a cock ring inside.
I'm not even fucking with you.
And you can tell because it's got that funky latex-y condom smell sort of thing going on.
People are like, oh my god!
Close the disc, hand it back, say that's yours.
Drugs, there have been joints and shit in cases Gamers are dirty ass people So someone graffitiing inside their game cases and forgetting about it That's nothing PSP memory cards were awesome If you ever audited them, the ones that we took on trade I bet you that like 50% of them had porn on them We sold one to a kid once, his mom came back, she was so mad at us She's like, don't you check this?
It's like, no Take it home, format it
if your 14 year old decided he was going to look around on it and keep it on his PSP that's because he's a 14 year old who's like porn exactly so you're saying what I'm hearing out of you Dan is that it could have been a lot fucking worse and this really is nothing gamers are skeevy fucking terrible people you guys all know you are
All right.
We got a new name for the segment here.
It's Orange Lounge Radio featuring Dan making gamers look bad.
I had a friend confide in me that he had to call Netflix because he wanted to send back his copy of There Will Be Blood or Kill Bill 2.
And he just...
he accidentally put there will be cock yeah it no case it was like it was like it was like boner bros 12 return of the skater teens or whatever and he's like i netflix hello there's a movie on the way to you and their little return cardboard and i i have the movie here i sent you the wrong thing and they're like oh this happens all the time we'll send it back
How do you make that mistake?
As far as porn names go, it was not a tasteful one.
I'll put it that way.
No, no, I'm not the porn, like the actual Netflix movie.
There's a big difference between sense and sensibility and sniffing balls.
There's a big difference between what those DVDs probably look like, you know?
Yeah, and he was worried that the disc, whatever, at Netflix, Netflix is all automated, so it would have sent that onto the next person in their queue, and they would have ended up on the local news.
So he did his due diligence and called and said, there's porn on the way to you.
But yeah, this stuff happens all the time.
Doesn't surprise me.
and I imagine the person who bought the Sonic game at full retail you know was up late at night and like this game is terrible so he took the instruction booklet and he's like here's what I think of this game and he just threw a big dick this game is cock and then he put it away that's probably what happened fantastic sigh we need to go back to a time when gaming was much simpler and easier music
Back before people were drawing penises in the instruction manual.
Ah, just kidding.
People have always been drawing penises in the instruction manuals, right?
It's the classic game of the week.
Every week here on the program, DarkSakura takes a trip into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks you all should be playing this week.
But she's not here, so not this week.
So this week, SalaciousPop is going to take a trip into DarkSakura's gaming vault and pull out a game that he thinks you all should be playing this week.
Salacious Pop, what is the classic game of the week?
Well, I'm finally giving up the whole Sierra Online classic PC thing.
I've sort of written that into the ground.
So I'm taking it to Lagoon on the Super Nintendo.
All right, let's hear some music from Lagoon.
Lagoon.
So, Lagoon got its notoriety because it was an RPG that came out near the beginning of the console's life.
Obviously, those of us that remember when the Super Nintendo launched, there was Final Fantasy 2, or 4, that was a launch title.
The really big heavy-hitter RPGs like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 3, didn't come until much later.
in the SNES's life cycle.
Final Fantasy II wasn't technically a launch title, but it would be that launch window.
It was the Christmas.
That turn that Nintendo loves, launch window.
So Lagoon came out within a year or a year and a half when there wasn't really much in the way of RPGs to play after you've beaten Final Fantasy.
Lagoon was a top-down, sort of think like Zelda-styled game.
It was...
A pretty unabashed Wanderers of Ys clone.
Before there was a Zelda game on the Super Nintendo, it's important to say, because Link to the Past didn't come out until the next Christmas or the Christmas after.
And the Ys games, which I think came out on the TurboGrafx-16, wasn't a system that most people owned, really.
So Lagoon is pretty much a clone, sort of like Secret of Mana, that style of action RPG, but
I played this game.
I didn't actually beat it.
I borrowed it from a friend and I played it for about a week and had to give it up, give it back.
But yeah, the plot is that you live in Lakeland, which is a very lush, beautiful world of water and everything.
And this evil wizard has been poisoning the water by the underground castle of Lagoon, which is where all of the magical water comes from.
He poisoned it because he wants to raise a big bad demon.
Very cookie cutter JRPG plotline.
Thank you for watching!
so yeah so the water's been poisoned the evil wizard has taken the castle of lagoon out of from the bottom of the sea and he's made it float up into the sky and you have to go eventually go from village to village and level up and beat dungeons and get treasure and eventually you go up to the final dungeon the castle and um the opening uh sort of has a sort of anime
Intro, or as much as you could do on the Super Nintendo.
And for those of us that are familiar with Ys, the art style, they have the big anime bright eyes that was in Wanderers of Ys, so that's kind of how the art direction was.
Just a competent RPG, not really groundbreaking.
It was kind of buggy.
The boss battles were actually pretty hard if you didn't know how to avoid the little bullets.
This game also came out on the Sharp X68000, a Sharp PC home computer product that was released only in Japan.
DarkSakura.com
I believe they also did the Drakken games.
Drakken and Dragonsville.
Yeah, and that was also another Super NES RPG where it was kind of... If you were an RPG freak like me, your options were limited.
I had Drakken.
My parents bought me Drakken.
When I got a Super Nintendo for that Christmas, I got Super Mario World, because it comes with it, and Drakken.
Because that was the game that the Sears person told me to buy.
Or Montgomery Ward, or wherever they bought my Super Nintendo.
So...
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
One additional audio clip that I wanted to have you play is when you kill the boss, you know, you just hack it out and it dies, it had this sort of shriek that played when you killed the boss, and every boss, whether it was a robot or a dinosaur, made the same noise.
Let's play it and see if we can recognize what wave file this is.
Okay, so here goes the boss.
Do you always skip ahead a little bit to the actual death here?
Uh...
Yeah, here we go.
He's exploiting this first boss by finding a spot in the back of the room.
Here we go.
SoundClipFiles.com
so like usually there's little samples of like yeah boy or things like that that you hear like in a DDR song that then you'll hear later in a game somewhere else and it's really weird like um I want to say one of the big DDR songs you hear the samples somewhere else it's really weird max 300 the fire that whole thing like those those clips you hear those elsewhere so anyway
Yeah, so I just thought it was funny that I didn't put this together at the time, but yeah, the boss noise when you kill a boss is the elephant cry in the wholesome stage, Street Fighter 2.
Nice.
But the dungeons in this, you know, had some pretty clever map design, more clever than it probably had any right to.
You know, you could get lost.
But it was a pretty fast-paced game.
You didn't really have to grind too much.
You just hit from town to dungeon, and there was always something to do.
All right.
DarkSakura.com
Alright, we're going to take a quick break here, though, guys.
Gosh, I thought it was going to be a short night.
Part A has been two hours and eight minutes.
That's like the longest Part A I think I've seen in a long time.
So, good thing it's a three-day weekend, huh?
We've got plenty more show to come, including your calls, some news about Resistance, Persona 4, a Super Mario Bros.
and Portal crossover game.
That's going to be very interesting.
And your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR, as well as your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live here on this Sunday evening, September the 4th of 2011, Labor Day weekend, with the 426th episode of our program.
We're running a little long tonight.
Part A was about two hours.
I don't think Part B will be quite as long.
And we had a late start live tonight, too, which I know doesn't affect the podcasties.
But good thing it's a three-day weekend.
Let's just put it that way.
We don't have to get up early for work tomorrow.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I always kind of thought, like, I don't want to say it's weird to, like, watch playthroughs because I get the allure of that.
You know, like, who doesn't like to sit and watch someone else play a video game?
And the Internet's made that very interesting where you can kind of do all that through YouTube and so forth.
But I don't know.
I like to kind of get my hands on and play and all that stuff.
And so I kind of want to do a playthrough of Super Metroid or something retro.
I'd love to record a Let's Play and put it on YouTube, but I do not have the attention span.
You don't have the attention span to do that?
Unless it was a short game.
30 hours of, yeah.
a let's play of Tetris yo I did a four block we're done we could do a let's play you want to do a let's play we'll do that someday it'd be fun pick a game that's only a couple hours we could do Metroid 1 I could be Metroid 1 in about if I kind of what I'd have to do is I'd have to play through it the day before and then I could do a play through the night of and once I kind of remember where everything's at like it's one of those things you never forget but like you kind of want to play it one time to refresh your memory I could probably play through it in a couple hours once I just kind of remember where everything's at
You know that Amnesia game that's big on Steam?
Oh, God.
Where if you are in pitch blackness, you go crazy, and there's this scary monster that you have to hide from it?
The Let's Play of that game are hilarious, because there are people that are just in tears.
Hiding in the closet.
It's very scary.
It's a scary game.
Yeah, and for the people that record commentary of what they're doing in the game, Amnesia Let's Plays, look for the one on YouTube that has a couple hundred thousand hits and you will laugh.
Because this poor man, he thinks that he's really dying in real life.
He's very scared.
I need to find some sound clips from some of those and play them on the show.
I bet they're hilarious.
They're like the reaction videos to Two Girls, One Cup.
Right?
Something like that.
All right.
Let's move on with some rapid fire news.
And we'll start off with Loki.
Going to give us some quick news.
Yes, there's some rumors.
I mean, this is kind of a given that there will be like an Epic Mickey 2, something that did pretty well.
But coming from a... Really?
I thought it didn't do too well from what I heard.
It did pretty well for a Wii game.
All right.
Of course, there's some surveys going around asking people what their preferred packaging for Epic Mickey 2 would be.
And, um, a little bit, cause some details are kind of, uh, derived based on that.
Apparently, Epic Mickey 2, um, will feature Oswald the Lucky Rabbit as well.
It almost looks like as another playable character.
And, um, you know, uh, looks like it, they may do some sort of split screen with that as well.
And it looks like that Oswald, uh, can use his ears as kind of like a helicopter.
Um.
No real word, of course.
I'm sure this is maybe like a 2012 holiday game if it's being worked on right now.
They're probably not happy that this leaked if it is holiday 2012.
Yeah, so...
Yeah, I mean, it's definitely something that they're working on.
Could it be something where they're just gauging interest and it may not actually be being made at all?
Or do you think something like this happens?
I mean, because games aren't developed overnight.
So maybe this is one of those things where the games are already in development and it's like, you know, a year long or whatever.
I don't know about that.
I would think that they're actually working on it.
It says, like the screenshot that they have, it says, now we would like to show you a few more packages for Disney's Epic Mickey 2 video game.
Please indicate which package design makes you most interested in purchasing Disney's
I think the third one is the best out of those I agree with you yes which is just the two guys kind of it's not really an action shot everything else is an action shot and that except that second one where they're kind of jumping off into the two but you can't really see their faces which is a little weird to me yeah I like the third one it's pretty good
Anyhow, here we are taking the survey.
All right.
What else?
This is kind of cool.
Apparently, MadCatz has announced that they're going to be doing some official licensed Major League Gaming controllers.
Now, normally, if it were the case of the Major League Gaming, I wouldn't give a shit about it.
And their fight stick, it's expensive.
It just looks like one of the normal MadCatz fight sticks that they put out for a street fighter or something like that.
That's fine.
But what makes me interested, though, is actually their controller.
The controller that they've got out, yes, it's wired, but it's got a bunch of neat features.
For example, you're able to swap out the analog sticks if you want, and you can swap them between basically the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 ones.
Also, you'll be able to swap out the D-pad, and you can put in either a PlayStation 3 or the 360 D-pad.
That is awesome.
So I could have PlayStation 3 controls on my 360.
Yes.
Style controls.
I'm just, I'm a little bit flabbergasted and I'm partially kind of like, why haven't we seen this before?
Like, the 360 would be great if it had the PlayStation 3's controller.
Yeah, and it also includes placement.
So like, for example, you could put, you know, the analog sticks, you can move them around or whatever if you want.
Really?
Dan's saying they used to make a controller like that.
I just don't even remember.
Old school PlayStation era stuff.
No prices have been announced yet, but these controllers include the base controller, two pro module D-pads, one that's like the Xbox 360.
One that's like the PlayStation 3.
Four analog sticks.
Two that are like the 360.
Two that are like the PS3.
Two faceplates.
A matte finish or glossy finish.
A braided 3 meter cable that actually screws onto the controller.
Integrated weight compartment so you can adjust the weights on there.
It's getting more and more expensive.
And Pro Case that the whole thing is stored in.
Plus they're saying that they're going to be able to sell additional add-ons later on like customized
How much?
They haven't said.
I do know that the fight stick is like $150.
So I would hope that this is around the same price as a regular controller.
Although I'd imagine it's probably going to be around like $70, $80.
Yeah, I was going to say that looks $69.99 right there.
That's not bad if it's $69.99 because regular controllers are $60.
$10 extra, yeah, that might be worth it.
Yeah, and DarkTattoo is in our chatroom saying, See, I thought Rob might like this considering the 360's D-pad is ass.
Exactly.
I do like this, actually.
Interesting.
All right.
All right.
And then last but not least, Dance Central 2, they announced some tracks for that.
And actually, some of these are pretty awesome.
Hadaway, What Is Love.
Oh, my God.
Yes.
That is awesome.
That's that song from the club guys, the Saturday Night Live, The Night at the Roxbury.
That's what it's called.
Digital Underground with the Humpty Dance.
Sir Mix-a-Lot, Baby Got Back, The Mix Mix, not really sure what that is, Bobby Bound, My Prerogative, Curtis Blow, The Breaks, and Usher featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris, yeah.
So, not bad.
It's got a pretty kickass song list so far.
Definitely interested in this game, no surprise there.
Outro Music
Alright, well, I got some news for you guys.
It starts off with news on Zelda Skyward Sword.
There's going to be a $70 bundle that comes... Actually, I'm sorry to interrupt you real quick.
Yeah, go ahead.
I was going to say, they do, remember, have that mode, or maybe that's in Just Dance 3, but where you can create your own routines, so maybe... I don't think that was in Dance 3.
I don't think you think it's Just Dance.
Damn it!
Alright.
Uh, there's going to be a $70 Zelda Skyward Sword bundle, and it comes with the Wii Remote Plus.
It's a gold one.
Uh, that's good for those that never did buy a Wii Remote Plus, including myself.
I never bothered with the attachment or anything, but this is one of those, like, all-in-one Wii controllers.
So, IDK, I might have to pick this up.
I'm not sure yet.
I'm still not kind of sure how I feel about Zelda Skyward Sword, but you do, you have to have the, uh...
and Wii Motion Plus in order to play it.
You really should get one of those.
I don't know if I'd spend the extra money.
Well, it's not bad.
The controller itself is going to be, what, $40?
So I might as well get the game.
I just bought Wii Motion Pluses, so big deal.
My controller is a little longer.
Just so you know, it also comes with a CD from the Zelda 25th Anniversary Concert.
This all comes out on November 20th.
They are saying that the initial print of both the Wii controller and just the regular game by itself will have the CD.
That's pretty cool.
And the gold Wiimote's kind of neat, I guess, if you're into color collecting.
Burnout Crash coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and the date has been set September 20th and that'll set you back either 800 Microsoft points which is 10 bucks or $9.99 on PlayStation Network so you can save a whole penny
Radiant Silvergun is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and it's been dated for September 14th.
1,200 Microsoft points.
That's 15 bucks.
No word on a PlayStation Network version.
But yeah, it's not just a port.
I believe this is like a little remake.
It's going to have an online two-player co-op, Saturn and arcade-style game variants, different graphical modes, an Ikaruga scoring system.
I was going to say that was a big Saturn game when the Saturn tried to survive here.
And I think that's a former or previous classic game of the week.
Oh, I'm sure.
I'm sure Jamie probably has highlighted every treasure made game at some point.
So Radiant Silvergun on Xbox Live Arcade.
I know anybody who's a fan of shooters at all has got to be at least a little curious about this, if not just downright excited.
All right, let's move on.
Professor Layton 4.
We're getting it.
We're getting it soon.
We're getting it in October.
It is called Professor Layton and the Last Spectre.
It is the fourth game in the series.
It was just announced that we're getting it on the 3DS, even though it's not technically a 3DS game.
on October 17th and it's the Japanese version of the game came out with a little sort of Gaiden side story thing within this within the same cartridge called Professor Layton's London Life RPG we are getting that as well translated so we're getting the bonus game along with the proper sequel this October and uh
Also, in quickfire news, we have a bundle coming out for the Kinect, which is going to come with Child of Eden.
And the price point is going to be $150.
I'm not sure if that's... How much is the Kinect right now by itself, retail?
$100?
$150?
Loki, do you know off the top of your head?
Is it $150?
$150, yeah.
Yeah, and... So, yeah, that is...
Coming, let's see when the story is.
I think it's September 20th, if I remember correctly.
Yeah, I'm not seeing a date on this story glaring out at me.
But yeah, if you loved Rez, which is an amazing music and special effects game, Child of Eden, believe it or not, is easier to play with a controller.
I think so, yeah.
But seeing how the Kinect interface with the game is neat.
But yeah, so the Kinect is getting a bundle game, Child of Eden, soon.
I talked about this when I first reviewed Child of Eden, but I honestly think it's going to be better on the move.
But that's just me.
And finally, let's see if I can pronounce this right.
D3 is coming out with new...
Onichanbara.
Onichanbara, thank you, game.
Basically, you are bikini-clad Japanese schoolgirls.
It looks like it's kind of like a bastard on Dreamcast or Devil May Cry slasher game.
Very gory.
You're basically bikini schoolgirls killing zombies.
And when you kill a zombie, blood everywhere.
Blood splash.
Oh, God, so much blood.
She wears a bikini and a cowboy hat.
Yep.
That is it.
And it's an Xbox exclusive game coming out in Japan this winter.
So yeah, Onichanbara 2.
And we don't have part one here in the States.
But it sounds like something.
Oh, we do?
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
So if it comes out over there, then maybe we'll get the sequel here.
and Babes Killing Zombies.
What's not to love?
All right, I want to throw out one more plug for the upcoming indie segment here on the show.
Go figure, the week we're not here, I'm finally getting some bites on this.
So I think we're ready to roll this out next week.
But I do want to just say one more time before we roll out this segment.
If you have an indie game, if you're developing one, or you know people who are, and it could be for a PC, it could be for Xbox Live Indie Arcade, it could be iOS, I don't really care.
As long as you're independent, we want to feature more independent games.
Thanks for watching!
Twitter.com slash OLR We'll be getting to those shortly But first, a couple more stories
According to Howard Stringer, he is saying that the PlayStation Network is bouncing back.
Wait, Howard Stern, the shock jock DJ?
No, Stringer.
Oh, Stringer.
Not Stern.
He is basically saying the PlayStation Network is more secure and better than ever, and added that the company is working to expand the service, which has added 3 million new customers since the attack.
and sales have actually increased relative to the pre-attack levels.
So, interesting.
Told you people would forget about it in a few months.
Yeah, well, that's very not surprising that everybody's going to forgive and forget after a few months.
Except maybe those people who sold back their systems in a fit.
I don't know.
You know what I honestly think might be happening?
I think people stole all the Sony information and have been using it to hack the Xboxes.
I could swear I had different passwords on 360 and PlayStation Network, but now I'm thinking maybe I didn't.
And maybe that's how my Xbox was hacked.
I don't know.
but it's just interesting so alright anyhow story for you guys about something that was announced to E3 this year that had a lot of people very excited it was the Playstation 3D display bundle yes remember when they were going to be selling the monitor with Resistance 3 for $4.99 but then when they were like actually we're not going to put Resistance 3 in there we're going to put Motorstorm Apocalypse in there and some retailers were like well fuck you we're going to give Resistance 3 anyway so that way they pre-order with us well
Actually, this is interesting.
Sony has apparently made this their plan the whole time.
Resistance 3 is going to be included with any 3D display that was pre-ordered before September 30th.
Motorstorm, though, will be included no matter what.
So that's why Walmart, Amazon, and GameStop were putting out all these deals.
I guess the whole time, Sony was like, yeah, you can offer this deal.
And so it was to look like a pre-order.
I don't know.
Is it a brilliant marketing scheme, or do you feel a little used?
Eh, who cares?
It's just a TV.
I don't think it's selling as well as they'd hoped.
Really?
Well, come on.
It's a $499...
Yeah, but it's 3D and it comes with two games.
It's 24-inch.
It's not that bad.
That's perfect for a dorm room.
I would have loved this in college.
Yeah, it's perfect for a dorm room, but then you've got to buy another pair of glasses if you want to... It's expensive.
There's a small part of me that's interested, but then I go, but if I could kick down another $300, I could just get a large 3D TV.
They're just trying to get you to buy it now, but then you wait just a little longer and you're going to be able to get a...
You know, full-size HDTV that supports 3D for less money.
And think of how fast the technology is evolving.
I mean, right now they're trying to sell us on these active shutter glasses, which I've used them and they give you a headache.
And on Sony TV, too.
But, um, just wait until they've come out with some technology where, well, they already have it out, but, you know, where it becomes more mainstream, where it's either the non-shutter glasses, because each one of those is fucking $70.
$70 for a pair of glasses.
Wow.
When you can, you know, I hope they got the technology that they use for, um, you know, the Disney stuff or whatever, and in theaters with those cheap-ass $5 glasses, you know.
That's what needs to become mainstream.
I can't steal a pair of glasses from the theaters and use them on these TVs?
No, they're active shutter.
Isn't that what the fucking Sega Master System used?
Yeah, that's what all the old 3D systems used.
It was active shutter technology.
Even way back to the Vectrex was active shutter technology.
um you know the old school 3D stuff in um IMAX was active shutter stuff but what they need if they just you know really adopt that format with those cheaper glasses I think that'd be the way to go because then it's not a big deal like it I think people will be more interested in that it's like okay I only have to drop money on this it's like well if I want to watch 3D my family I've got to drop you know another I have to buy another four pairs of glasses and there's another three hundred dollars
I don't know, SalaciousPop, what do you think about these TVs?
Do you think this is something I should get for the house?
Knowing us, we'll just save up and go to Fry's and get the real deal.
We don't need the starter kit.
I guess that's true.
That's kind of where I'm at with this.
For college kids, I guess if you're in college and you need a 3D TV that'll fit in a dorm room.
I need a 3D TV in my dorm room amongst all the college expenses.
You know what?
My Super Nintendo And that wasn't even the cutting edge thing The kids upstairs had a Nintendo 64 And they were like the most popular kids in the dorm But I was probably second popular with my Mario Kart Knights In the dorm room And Duke Nukem 3 I mean, just wait If Sony's able to put out a monitor for $499 And Sony, I mean, they're known for being pretty high end As far as price points go on their products
Just wait.
They're going to be able to do that.
Right now, people aren't putting out 3D TVs that are 24 inches because who the fuck is going to buy that?
If you're going to buy an HD TV and have it 3D, it's going to be something that's being used in your living room.
You're going to want it to be pretty big.
If there's a demand for it, people put it out and they'll put it out cheaper and it'll be better technology.
Just wait.
You don't need to jump in the 3D right away.
All right.
Let's visit the mailbag and see what you guys think.
After all, we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
We'd like to share your voices, not just through chat, but through email and Twitter and so forth.
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrainer.com is a place you can send us emails to get your longer thoughts out, more than 140 characters.
And Salacious Pop, sitting in for trying to fill Jamie's shoes tonight, is going to go ahead and take over the mailbag.
Okay, our first email tonight is from Osfer.
And he writes... I wasn't drunk, Osfer, I swear.
Ha ha.
Hi guys.
Hugs.
I miss you all and it's been a while since I wrote in, so here goes.
First off, as you saw on Twitter, I was in Disney World for a week and just returned on Monday, the 22nd.
I remember Rob mentioning something about Electronica in Disneyland and being the huge fan that I am of Tron Legacy, I was looking forward to seeing something like that at Disney World.
It turns out that there was nothing Tron related there other than some Blu-ray discs of the movie on some store shelves.
What exactly did I miss out on?
Tron was on the monorail for a short time, but nothing but a painting, really.
Disney World, they didn't do anything for Tron there, it's true.
Also, I've always wondered why there isn't a Kingdom Hearts attraction at any of the parks.
Probably because it's... I'm wondering that too.
That's a brilliant question.
It's like Disney refuses to acknowledge it.
Maybe because it's more a Square Enix thing.
They probably have to share...
The characters, money, royalties with Square Well, first off, I think, funny that he brought up Electronica It makes me feel justified for the 10 minute tangent in Part A But I think we kind of covered it in Part A, so I don't think I need to elaborate further But as far as Kingdom Hearts, I will tell you the one thing, one thing, two things I've ever seen Kingdom Hearts related in the park
Once, I was at a store called Off The Page in California Adventure, and now I go there every time because when I was there once, I saw a Sora figurine, and it was one of those nice ceramic figurines going for like 100 bucks.
It was that type of quality, like a ceramic doll, and I really wish I bought it, and I regret not buying it.
and that's the only thing Kingdom Hearts related I've ever seen in the park besides number two some parents brought their little kid once dressed as Sora and I saw them standing in line for the Haunted Mansion they were from Australia you know how sometimes little kids want to dress up and big kids can't dress up by the way they don't let you in Disneyland you have to be like seven or under if you want to wear a costume unless it's Halloween and you're at the Halloween party but we saw some Australian parents bring in their like six year old in a Sora costume and it was adorable
DarkTetsuya says there was a Sora statue in Innoventions.
and that I wouldn't you know I don't go in interventions a lot I gotta be honest interventions kind of weak and they really need to convert the building into something interesting but I wouldn't be surprised that they had a nod to Sora in there as well especially because last time I was in there which is a couple years ago they had Xbox 360 units that were the exact same things that were on the E3 show floor earlier that year so you know they get some use out of those year round
Does no one else think that a ride of some sort would be pretty awesome?
Again, this is in regards to Kingdom Hearts.
Or is it just something that Square Enix is holding back on for when they launch their own amusement park?
Smirk.
Or sigh.
I guess my dream shall suffice for now.
I would assume Disney Sea in Tokyo has more, but that's of course a huge assumption, and I don't really know.
I would have to rely on a Japanese listener who maybe has been there to tell me if Kingdom Hearts has more of a presence there.
I'm assuming, but I could be wrong.
I like that.
Tears.
It was on the show a couple weeks ago.
Okay.
Yeah.
and I'm going to end this email with one last question regarding 3DS colors you guys mentioned that the flare red 3DS would be coming out in the US in early September the thing is I'm holding out for the release of the purple 3DS that was shown on the floor at E3
That thing looked freaking beautiful, and he included a link to it, and it's gorgeous.
It's sexy.
It's very Prince, Joker, shade of deep purple.
Yeah, it's like the cool purple.
It's that metallic purple, not like the girly lavender.
It's not lavender.
That's a kid at ChrisColor if I ever saw one.
I didn't, you know, and I was at E3 that year too.
That's an eggplant purple right there.
Eggplant wizard?
Yeah, I like that.
I wish I remembered seeing that because that is a sexy 3DS.
Well, I may consider getting the Flare Red system.
Is there any word on more colors coming out in the near future?
No, they haven't announced anything other than the Flare Red one, and they're not going to.
Just wait for them to make their announcement.
Yeah, wait for that Tokyo event, because that could be, but that's probably going to be more Japan.
But you never know.
I would still say hold out until after the Tokyo event, which won't be that long after the Flare Red DS is out anyway, 3DS is out anyway.
It could.
It could.
It could.
and DarkSakura
The first or the two thirds of the email is basically just a verbatim talking about the Deus Ex GameStop removing the code controversy.
So the first 30 minutes of the show is really for you, Holly.
I'm not going to read it just because it's literally just saying what happened and how there was a leaked memo and blah, blah, blah.
So the commentary, seriously, I've been off GameStop for a while, but I still went in and looked now and then, and I still considered buying things from there.
But coupled with what Sky has been saying lately in this, referring to the code scandal with Deus Ex, well, this is the final straw.
No more, now it's Power Gamer, Best Buy, or online retailers.
GameStop can stuff it.
Yeah, I mean, we kind of talked to death about it the first 30 minutes of the show, but I think what Holly's saying in her email echoes what quite a few people are thinking this week.
It will be interesting.
I would like to go back and ask these people in a year, did you stick with it?
I would ask myself that in a year too.
Did I stick with it or did I break down because GameStop had some stupid exclusive that I had to have?
I'm trying to think.
If they get a Skyrim exclusive, I'm going to be so goddamn pissed.
I don't remember the last time I was in a GameStop.
Me neither.
For anything.
I remember the last game I bought.
We look when we go in the mall.
We've gone in the mall and looked, but it's more of a...
Well, what's new?
I forget what games are out.
Even though I do this show, sometimes I forget what games are out.
I think the last time I was in there, well, one of the times I remember was when I was picking up extra copies of episodes from Liberty City just to stock the other machines we have.
But I don't think I bought a new game from them for a long time.
Yeah, I don't remember the last thing I bought at one.
Do you?
I don't remember.
usually when we go in it's to see what obscure thing that they have for 360 or PS3 that's used at a decent price and usually oh that's priced too high for a used game and we leave I still have a gift card there it's like that same story every time isn't it I like their magazine sometimes we're just fucking bored and you want to go window shop you know like even though everything I said about the place is just kind of whatever it's here let's just go in and look I'm not going to buy anything but I'll look
And sometimes, you know, and this goes for a lot of places, they may have good deals on like rock band equipment or something like that if you need some of that.
I mean, because it's so dirt cheap nowadays.
and our final email is from Chiggers.
This is sent through our comment system on the site.
Can you think of any other more recent games that have historical facts and whether or not you think it would be used more in today's games as a teaching tool?
I can think of God of War would be good for mythology.
That's a stretch, but okay.
It would make you more aware of what different gods were, titans were.
The Pantheon is accurate, Athena, Ares, that's all.
All the edutainment games that I think of that I learned shit from is obviously very old and dated.
I think of Oregon Trail, I think of Number Munchers, absolutely Carmen Sandiego, Math Blasters, but all that shit's old.
But at the same time, actually, a lot of that shit is still around.
Like, I believe Math Blasters still exists in some form.
I want to say... Oregon Trail's been remade.
Oregon Trail's been remade.
Now it's a Facebook game and kids have that.
It's different now.
Yeah, so a lot of those games actually still exist.
Like, they've been updating them.
We just don't follow them because we're not six or seven anymore, except the occasional retro cool, oh, LOL, Oregon Trail on Facebook, ha ha ha, I made Salacious Pop die of dysentery, right?
Like, that's about the extent of it.
But who really sits down to play an edutainment game anymore?
Not a lot.
But I don't think I learned anything from Oregon Trail.
You learned that if you killed 4,000 pounds of buffalo, you could only take 10 pounds of it back.
I learned that that was fun, yes.
You learned where does the Oregon Trail start?
I don't know.
Independence, Missouri, and that's why I remember that from the game.
See, I learned nothing from the Oregon Trail.
Of course, I hope I got that right or I'm going to sound hella stupid.
I guess I didn't learn anything from the Oregon Trail whatsoever.
It starts in Florida.
No.
I need to click on this IGN article and see what's actually being quoted here.
Oh, come on.
You know there's nothing valuable there.
For those that played Bioshock, the first one, the whole story of Rapture, the Under the Sea City, was based off of Anne Rand, the Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged, the objectivism approach to politics, which is some pretty highbrow adult concepts.
You wouldn't really know who Anne Rand is from playing that game, but the antagonist was Andrew Ryan, obviously a play on her name.
So that was a game developer saying, let's take this whole,
you know way of thinking that a lot of adults you apply to their politics and make a video game based on based on it I don't know that that was kind of an intellectual angle for a game did you play Bioshock did you pick up on any of that um I played a little bit of it but I more picked up because I didn't get to that killer twist ending that everybody talks about
because I'm terrible at first person shooters.
I was more like, wow, this game is really good looking.
Great game.
Yeah, I know.
Well, here's the thing.
Now that you just told me that if I wait for Bioshock Infinite on PlayStation 3, I can get the first game for free.
Yeah, that's like in a year.
It's over a year from now.
Dude, just seriously.
I don't think I have the first game.
Is there a skill level where like any dope can get through?
Yeah, you can play it on easy.
Okay.
Is it like Prey where you never die?
That's the only reason I could play Prey.
You die, but there's respawn points and it's not like you're dead forever.
Alright, I could do that.
Steam has had Bioshock 2 on sale for $8 and you get 1 for free.
2 I wasn't a big fan of, although I should really go back and play it, but 1 was great.
It was a great game.
That's why I'm so... Infinite looks... It looks great.
I just can't wait to play it.
The Civilization Series
Excellent point.
The Civ series are amazing.
Dan just handed me a copy of Bioshock on the PlayStation 3 from the vault and gave me that here, take it, look.
So I guess I'm playing Bioshock.
You need to finish it.
You don't get to keep it.
Well, can I keep it as long as DarkSakura keeps some of my shit?
Because...
Alright.
I think she had my copy of Clue for like two years.
I thought it was my copy of Clue.
I was like, where the fuck did I get this?
Oh, that's Rob's.
They can't hear you.
They can't hear you, Dan.
Alright.
Moving on.
So that's it for the mailbag.
Thanks for writing in.
Thanks for reading tonight.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to do that in the future.
I like that.
I can't believe I didn't think of that answer.
I just talked about that in my freaking week.
Civilization Games.
Absolutely.
You learn about some of the great leaders and sometimes the units that they get that are special talk about their culture or are kind of something to that culture.
You're not going to learn detailed facts but sometimes you're playing scenarios and things like that.
That's a great answer.
Maybe some of the World War II Call of Duty games or Battlefield games you may learn a little bit about history and stuff there.
I don't know.
Alright.
Moving on, let's talk about the FUs of the week.
Oh, every week here on the program we get angsty.
Why?
Because we can.
We have a microphone and your attention, so we're going to rant.
That's what people do.
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
Fuck you to the Marx system.
For those who are unaware of what the Marx system is, think of it like an enhanced version of the Dewey Decimal System, or like a bibliography for everything in the goddamn world.
I fucking had to learn that shit this week, and it was boring as hell.
It's like libraries are so fucking old school.
Get with the times.
They have to like...
It's ridiculous all the crap that they break down about each individual thing.
Mainly, I was looking for DVDs and games, but oh my god, it was boring.
And I had to learn the Dewey Decimal System for a little bit, which actually, Dewey Decimal System isn't as complicated as I thought, which is great.
But I still don't care.
So fuck you, though.
Slay just popped.
Do you have any reviews of the week?
This might be taking from your FUs, but FU to giant huge spiders that like to make webs above our front door, so we have to not walk into them.
He's big.
I don't want to... I need to spray acid on him, or the pesticide, the raid.
It's a big spider.
You need to open the door, spray it, and close it real fast.
No, I'm going to do it from the patio.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Stun him with Windex, follow up with Bug Spree afterwards.
That's why I did that with the fly.
It basically knocked the fly out of the air.
He couldn't fly anymore.
Got him with Ray turned upside down.
Who knew we were going to learn bug killing tips on tonight's Orange Launch Radio?
Yeah, he hides up in the corner in the day and then he just parks in the middle of this huge ass web at night.
And he's like, walk into us.
I will eat your face.
It's a big fucking spider, people.
The spider is not playing.
and also FU2Cats who become manic and agitated when they're left home alone for four days when their owners go to Disneyland and they eat AV cables.
Did I mention that I lost a $50 set of headphones this week?
We came home from Disneyland and said, oh yay, the cats didn't, you know, shit and pee everywhere, and we turned on our PCs, and we look at our headsets that we use for Ventrilo on World of Warcraft, and they, on mine, they chewed that thing clean through, yours was just not up.
Unusable, of course.
Unusable, thank you.
But yeah, they've already been, I replaced them.
Rob was without his headset for 48 hours, I replaced them.
And it was the most painful...
48 hours of my life!
No, I had a backup headset, thank God.
And of course, the generous and graceful and wonderful DarkSakura did play cat sitter.
She did.
She came in and fed them and cleaned them.
Clearly, she did a terrible job.
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
My cats are assholes.
They don't know her.
They ran away from her and they decided we're gonna, because they see us at those computer desks all day.
So they just ate our headsets for fun.
Asshole cats.
Just teach us a lesson.
Yeah.
And then, by the way, we're leaving again at the end of the month.
Yeah, for another four or five days.
You shut the door to the office last night, I saw.
Oh, I did?
Yeah, were you afraid of that?
I thought maybe you were afraid of that happening overnight.
No, I left my computer on and my computer's loud.
Oh, okay.
Because I'm seeding torrents.
Ooh, what porn did you get?
Alright, moving on.
Going on to my FUs.
Funny enough, not the FUs I was thinking of.
The FU I'm thinking of tonight, FU to the fact that this morning I was supposed to get up at 9am, but I set my alarm on a weekday alarm on my iPhone, the same one as my work alarm.
You know sometimes you just change the time on the alarm without thinking it?
Oh yeah, it was only set for weekdays.
We're supposed to meet some people for brunch at 10.30?
We go to gay brunch every Sunday.
I try to.
I get a text message at 10.20.
We have a table.
It's in the back.
Oh, fuck.
And the text message woke me up.
2A.
Oh, fuck!
I think that's what you heard this morning, right?
That's what you woke up to?
Yeah.
Oops.
So F you to myself.
So yeah, we had to flake and say that we are lazy slugs and we slept.
We missed brunch.
The sound of gay man judgment coming through the phone.
You could just feel it.
You know what I'm talking about.
Alright, anyhow.
Moving on.
More news stories and then the Twitter and Skype line coming up at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Our toll-free number's back this week.
Hooray!
So, there's been a new break in the console hacking industry.
I don't know, scene, if you will.
Apparently, there is now a new exploit called the Reset Glitch Hack that allows any Xbox 360, any from now, before, and in the future to be turned into a JTAG console, period.
Apparently, it is an exploit that cannot be patched, and...
People have already found a way to... That sounds pretty definitive.
They've found a way to load this program called Zelle, which is kind of like a front-end for... They don't have any rebooters yet, which means you can't run a custom firmware on it yet, but right now you can launch homebrew stuff, and they have a video of someone actually running a Nintendo 64 emulator on their Slim, and...
you know a lot of people are going to use it for piracy
Well, at least right now there's no way to take JTAGs online without them being banned immediately.
Once people figure a way around that, then yeah.
It's interesting.
You have a JTAG, so it doesn't matter.
I don't know.
I'm just... I don't know.
I talked about this on the last show, which was two weeks ago, about when I talked about how I finally did the Wii because Joystick put the instructions up that made it look so easy.
And it's kind of like, you know, I have to really have a reason to do it.
And now my reason for at least the Wii is being able to play shit that Nintendo won't release in this country.
It's kind of nice.
So, I don't know.
I don't have a reason yet to do that to my 360.
Well, my 360 I use a lot for editing Grand Theft Auto So I use it to test stuff instead of having to burn discs every time Because back in the day when I first started doing Grand Theft Auto mods I did have to burn discs every time And I had a stack of discs that were just ridiculous So it does save me a lot of money in that sense Plus you can do mods and trainers and stuff like that on games And it's kind of fun
Persona 4
It's going to be out in Japan in 2012.
They're going to be enhancing some things.
New animation, one new character, new voice acting, wireless support where you can call others if you think you're about to die in a dungeon and so forth.
Crazy.
Also announced, however, which is very interesting, a Persona fighting game.
It's by Arc System Works.
You know them, BlazBlue, right?
It's Persona 4, The Ultimate, and Mayonaka Arena.
It's going to hit arcades in spring of 2012.
Apparently, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions will come out later in the summer.
So, Persona fans have a lot to be excited about.
I have Persona 3, the Hela edition that came out for the PS2, because it came out twice, Persona 3 and then the second edition.
And then I hear that the PSP port of Persona 3 that came out a year or two ago is even better than that.
And aren't those games, I haven't gotten really into a lot of the Persona games, but aren't they very big on like, it's kind of like a do whatever you want type of RPG, isn't it?
Some are.
A lot of them run on a calendar system where you have a certain amount of time in a day to do something.
But Persona 4 addressed some pretty adult concepts that aren't really that controversial, but they are because video games are for kids, of course.
that they handled very maturely.
And I'm glad that that content is there.
But yeah, and I have Persona 4 for the PS2.
I didn't know that.
Collector's Edition.
Yeah, it's on our shelf.
Never touched it.
Now this edition for the Vita may as well wait for the new one.
It's got more shit in it.
That adult content he's talking about is dick pics, of course.
Drawn in the instruction manual, of course.
Tastefully.
Tastefully.
All right.
Anyhow, so let's pop.
Why don't you give us another news story?
This was pretty huge on the internet last week, maybe the week before.
Basically a fan YouTube or a Flash animation of Super Mario Bros.
with Portal Gun.
Because of Portal 2, Portal Gun is awesome.
Everyone watched it on Newgrounds or YouTube and everyone laughed and it was great.
Let me play a little clip here in the background so you can kind of hear the noises.
A studio, it's a two-man team that calls themselves Stab Yourself, so Stab Yourself Studios.
Oh, what a pleasant name.
That's like one of the old-school Nintendo emulators.
Remember Nesticle?
Yeah, Genesis.
Yeah, charming names.
They are making Super Mario Bros.
with a portal gun.
uh for real they are working on it hopefully Valve and I know won't shut it down but um they have a proof of concept no Valve will just hire him yeah oh yeah absolutely Valve will just hire him to make a Mario clone that has the portal guns in it watch that's how Valve responds to things and they have sort of an alpha proof of concept YouTube up and you can see what the gameplay is like and it looks pretty awesome it's nice I think it's cool
Of course, is it going to be one of those games you play for five minutes and you're like, eh-huh?
Well, I know on Newgrounds there was the big... It's Super Mario Brothers, but you can play it as Samus and Kid Icarus, one of the Contra dudes.
Super Mario Crossover.
It reminds me of that.
Yeah, it does a little bit.
But yeah, they're saying that they're working on it and they've got a YouTube channel up for progress, but who knows if this will ever see the light of day or if it's going to get Nintendo to go shut it down.
We'll see.
All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys before we get to calls.
They should really get Gordon Ramsay to do the announcements for when they're going to say, Shut it down!
You're thinking Hell's Kitchen, right?
Yeah, Gordon Ramsay, yeah.
I've seen that show.
That show's been on how long?
It is terrible.
And it's on season 8 or 9?
It's so predictable.
Every challenge ends with a tie.
I know this has nothing to do with video games, but I gotta say... Wait, what show is this?
Hell's Kitchen.
It's been the same fucking show for 9 years.
Like, it really has.
Like, at least something like Survivor or Big Brother has the different people that get into the different conflicts and there's different twists and so forth.
But in Hell's Kitchen, the twists don't even matter.
Like, you...
I just turned it on randomly one day.
I had no idea who the fuck any of the people were, what season it even was, but I was just like, LOL, he's yelling at him.
He's really mean.
This show's funny.
It's the same fucking thing every week.
Someone on my Facebook who I went to high school with, he was one year below me.
I added him on Facebook a couple months ago, and I guess he's a trained chef from some San Francisco culinary academy.
He's trying to get on that show.
Oh, okay.
So he's trying to audition for Hell's Kitchen, yeah.
He may as well go on Top Chef.
It's a better show.
That's right.
People tell me I should be on Big Brother, and I'm like, I'm not cute enough for Big Brother.
But then they point out, well, you know, Adam's on there.
Here's a tip for anybody that's going on Hell's Kitchen.
The menu's always the same.
Learn how to cook the things on the goddamn menu and you'll be fine.
That's it.
It's always the same.
There's always a fucking risotto.
There's always a fucking chicken.
There's always a fish entree.
It's always the same goddamn thing.
Just learn how to cook that.
You're done.
You're set.
You're gonna have your own fucking restaurant.
And don't talk back.
I think you need to go on Hell's Kitchen.
I don't know how to cook.
Although if I did, I would learn how to cook the risotto and cook all that shit.
And then when he's like, this is what a risotto is supposed to taste like, I'm like, that's right, bitch.
That's right, you should have done it this way.
and you just don't talk.
I'll call me if you fucking call me a bitch.
No, I wouldn't talk to him though.
I'd talk to the other people that way.
You'd piss them off.
I love the stunt cake shows where they have to make this huge Spongebob square pants with like a fucking Ferris wheel and like a waterfall.
No, he's talking about, you know, Food Network Challenge or whatever.
It's always...
Thanks for watching!
and then I can watch Unwrapped with Mark Summers because it's Mark Summers!
I was really into Top Chef until I got too invested in it.
I see replays of it.
Yeah, replays are no new shows.
Aw, that's a bummer.
I watch a ton of Food Network.
A ton of Food Network.
When I lived with him, Nelly would come over and they would watch Food Network.
That's how I got to watching some of these shows because I'd just be kind of sitting there and I'd go, like, fucking food looks so fucking good.
Oh my god, this show's about, oh my god, it's an Unwrapped on Pringles.
Died!
We watch a lot of Food Network.
It's great.
I like watching Chopped because it's like a mini Iron Chef.
It's actually pretty good.
I like it.
It's pretty cool.
Hosted by Ted Allen from Queer Eye.
I really wish that show was on TV.
I love that show.
It's sad.
It's gone.
I do... We don't understand.
My guilty pleasure shows are makeover shows.
I love makeover shows.
Not necessarily people makeover... Loki is the straight one on the show.
Not necessarily people makeover shows.
It's like, you know, like the car makeover shows.
The Pimp My Ride.
There's a house makeover show.
I don't watch that, but they have Restaurant Impossible now.
It's a restaurant makeover show.
Do you watch Extreme Makeover?
No.
Did you watch The Swan?
No.
No, I don't watch the PeopleMaker episode.
I like them, like, building stuff, you know?
Like, I used to watch Junkyard Wars and stuff like that.
You know, stuff where they're taking a... Pin My Ride's kind of dumb.
I mean, they're like, oh, let's put 50 TVs in there.
That doesn't make any sense.
But, like, I like watching them, you know, do stuff to cars and, like, remake them and stuff.
Like, I used to watch the...
The Jesse James one or whatever, Monster Garage and stuff like that.
Those shows are awesome.
And Queer Eye was a good show.
I liked that show.
It was good.
Because the people that were on the show, the five guys that they had on there were great.
And now they have all their own stuff.
And Ted Allen's awesome.
He's one of the best people on the show.
One of them's on Dancing with the Stars.
Yeah, Carson, the blonde who was in charge of clothes.
I think?
He's, yeah, he's on Dancing with the Stars.
And people, it's so funny because people are not even talking about, like, when Lance Bass, a gay guy, was on Dancing with the Stars, you know, Middle America was all, oh my god, I can't believe, why aren't they partnering with another man?
It's so gross.
It's a family show.
Like, people aren't even fucking talking about Carson because they totally upped the ante by putting a transgender person on this year with Chaz Bono.
It's like, no one, no one cur that you're gay because we got a transgender and they're, oh my god, it's ruining America and all this bullshit.
Like, just...
What the hell were we talking about before?
I don't even remember now.
I don't know, but my point is if Chaz Bono wants to dance, god damn it, let him dance.
Shut the fuck up just because you can't dance.
And they'll have Gordon Ramsay come out and yell at him.
That'll bring it back to the top of the story.
But I do hope Ace of Cakes comes back this fall because I miss that show.
The way it ties into video games is there's a fucking DS game for every one of these goddamn shows we just mentioned.
Iron Chef, and it was terrible, yes.
I played that at PAX one year.
It was better than Cooking Mama.
Yeah, but it ended up being terrible.
All right.
Can we move on, Loki, with the gaming news story?
We can move on.
EA's trying to downplay the whole Origin exclusivity of their titles.
They're basically saying competition and choice go hand in hand, so the fact that we only distribute our own games...
On our own platform, I don't see that.
He explained that basically the company is in discussions with other publishers to have their games on Origin, but EA's key focus is to develop an impressive consumer experience where people are happy to play and buy games.
You're just fucking competing with Valve, okay?
Just stop dancing around it.
You're trying to compete with Valve, and it's just an awkward situation because you publish Valve games as well, so...
whatever so Battlefield 3 won't be on there big deal you know what I don't care you know I heard a story later in the week though about I guess Valve games are now showing up on yeah the PC ones like the actual physical games that EA published are showing up on their site but not any digital stuff alright one more story for you guys
Square Enix is going to be expanding and they're expanding Eidos Montreal.
They're going to be adding 350 employees over the next few years up to 2015.
Of course, they're not saying exactly what it is they're developing.
They haven't really officially announced this either.
But there's a report that's out there from La Presse Affaires.
It's a French name.
La Presse Affaires.
I don't know.
Le Precifé
And, you know, I think this is important to point out because with all these news of game studios closing and going under, it's nice to hear about some expanding, isn't it?
Montreal, Eidos, I believe, is making the fourth Thief game.
Remember the Thief series?
That's one of the big things they're working on.
So that's pretty cool.
And, of course, I'm sure there's secret products and all that good stuff.
So...
Alright, well, that brings us to phone calls!
So if you want to give us a call, you can.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
and we'll talk to you.
Otherwise, we're going to go to the Twitter and get some Twitter topics.
I got to load up Twitter.
I forgot to load up Twitter.
But you know what I did load up for Loki, actually?
I didn't get Twitter up, but I did get this up for Loki.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is me.
Hi, Miklatov Shane, whatever you want to call me.
Hi, Miklatov Shane, whatever you want to call me.
What's on your mind tonight?
Well, first I would like to say that I really just ditched a group in WoW to call, so we're all going to die because I'm the healer, but I just got up off my computer and went to the other room.
You know what they say, real life greater than WoW.
What?
Well, no, not always, but in this case, sure, why not?
Well, what was worth ditching the group to talk to us about tonight?
Well, first off, I'm still really mad about Electronica.
Not going to be up and running when I go to Anaheim in a couple weeks.
Well, what about Ossifer who emailed us saying that he went to Disney World expecting to see a version of it there and he got the shaft.
He got Tron on Blu-ray.
That's what he got.
Well, you know, that's a good movie.
So, I mean, at least he gets something out of it.
I'm going to go there and I'm not going to get anything because there won't be a store, there won't be a show.
No, I said go to D Street.
The D Street store has the Tron jackets.
That's where all the hats and jackets end.
Haven't you seen my Tron jacket?
Didn't you see that and you were like, I want one?
No.
You haven't seen my Tron jacket?
No, it's not the hat.
Oh, you saw the hat?
They have four different jackets, too.
My jacket is awesome.
Didn't you see that picture of me on Facebook with the disc and everything?
Oh, forget it.
You need to go find it.
There's some awesome... There's a windbreaker.
There's a jacket.
There's a parka.
They're really expensive, though.
Well, okay.
I'm going to find that picture on Facebook of my jacket while you talk about whatever else you want to talk about tonight.
Oh, the other thing is I like Origin over Steam, I've decided.
So even though a lot of people have been slamming Origin, you are a fan of it.
Why is this?
I just think it looks cleaner.
It's easier to navigate, in my opinion.
I've been playing Mass Effect 2 on it.
It's prettier.
What was that?
It's prettier.
Yes.
And that's all that matters, usually, for me.
So...
because it's prettier and I can navigate it and I don't know.
I just like it better.
I wish more things were on it like VVVVVVV or if Portal loaded through it, that'd be cool, but no.
No.
It's not there, but I still like it better.
I sent you a link, by the way.
Are you at your computer or did you leave?
No, I left.
Oh, because I sent you a link to that picture of the jacket.
I don't want to go by my computer.
I don't want to see me get group kicked.
I've never been group kicked.
I think this is one of those times where I'm going to be group kicked.
I think it's really more that Steam's been around so long.
Everybody loves Steam.
and here's something new and nobody wants to try it because it's not Steam.
And so now that they're trying to pull, well, we want to put our own games only on our service, that's offensive to these people that like Steam only.
I mean, it's not like GameStop's freaking platform that sucks because it's GameStop and they're terrible.
It's just EA and they used to be terrible but Activision has that title now so we can be okay with EA.
People need to realize that.
Be sure that no one cared because it was just a Fable game, so it was overhyped and not worth the money.
Well, yeah, that and even the third-party games that they got licensed to sell on their store.
The library wasn't there.
So, like, ooh, you could buy Fable 3 or Arkham Asylum, which is a great game, but between the two, I'm not going to start giving them my money through their, you know, game platform.
So you think people need... The EA actually has good games sometimes.
You think people need to cut Origin a break and just check it out already?
Yeah, I mean, you don't have to get all upset because you were going to buy Battlefield on Steam.
No, well, you're not going to use your Steam client.
Big deal, you'll still get it anyway, and Origin's not that bad.
I'll install it and check it out it's pretty white and orange I just don't I don't like having like five different stores on my computer I already have the games for Windows thing which granted I don't even use it anymore well you can delete that I know I can delete that but that's I have Game Room believe it or not I bought Game Room stuff for my PC so I kind of have to keep it to play that but otherwise you know Steam but if Origin sells a crazy ass like $2 game sale if they have the sales like Steam does I will definitely I might have to do it yeah
Maybe they will.
You can have two things running, it's fine.
I have Steven and Origin running all the time.
Together.
They're friends.
I'm working on Pokemon right now too, so I'm trying to divide my time evenly between this one called Pokemon World of Warcraft.
I have a Pokemon question for me, Klitov.
If I were to buy one of these two things, and it was going to... Because I've never played Pokemon, so I'm... Okay, but you know, my God.
So leave right now the studio and go to... What time is it?
There's something that's got to be open that can sell you it.
between either Black and White or HeartGold and SoulSilver I have to pick one one of the two generations and that's going to be my definitive Pokemon experience which one do you think I should get?
Black and White?
Black and White I think it's amazing SoulSilver and HeartGold are pretty cool because you can get all the old starters and it's all nostalgic but if you haven't played them before you're not going to get nostalgic for that crap
and Black and White is just overall better made.
Like, they actually have the sprite set move.
It's very annoying playing one of those games and it's like, I do an attack.
Well, my guy is frozen, but he slightly moves forward because he tackled you.
And it's stupid, but at least he's like kind of wobble around and they have animations and I felt the story was kind of darker too, which was neat.
And plus, everything that comes out download-wise
is going to be for the newest ones and not for the old ones anymore so like you'd be stuck with no cool downloads, no special events, just plain old silver and gold but remade to be more fun than they used to be but
Not worth it.
Black and white are better.
Actdeft in our chatroom agrees.
Black or white.
What?
Actdeft in our chatroom agrees.
Get Pokemon black or white.
Because I just heard from Pokemon Phantom that Gen 2, which would be silver and gold, is like the best.
But I guess that's a lot of nostalgia talking.
So I'll pick up black or white.
Oh, which color are you going to get?
Oh, I don't know.
I still need to use that card for the evil store.
So I might pick up one of those.
It's like...
I want you to get Pokemon, but not in that way.
I feel really disgusted.
Fine, whatever.
Bye.
Hopefully he'll see that picture, too, and he'll be very hateful.
Let's get to another call.
There's more calls coming in.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, guys.
It's DDR Dalla Bill.
DDR Dalla Bill.
What's on your mind?
Not much.
First off, great show tonight.
Thank you.
A little long, but that's alright.
It's Labor Day.
That's cool.
It's much more fun that way.
Alright, I'll just make a sort of brief.
They had a sale this week at Best Buy where they were selling Child of Eden for $10.
Oh yeah, I heard about that.
Yeah, me and about three other co-workers were busy going to the Best Buy website
and trying our best to get our hands on the game because they were just being sold out or backordered everywhere.
It was just insane.
But I did pick up a copy eventually.
And I want to say I was impressed, but at the same time, I wasn't.
Well, let's break it down.
Let's start with the bad.
Why did you leave with a feeling of, meh?
Why weren't you impressed?
because I was trying with the Kinect controllers and waving my hands and it didn't feel responsive.
It really didn't feel responsive.
Right.
Like, I couldn't... The controllers confused me a bit because I couldn't tell, even from the tutorial, which was the lock-on, what was the auto-fire, what was this.
It was just bizarre.
Please tell me you tried the controller at some point, though.
Uh... Not yet, but only because I figured since...
and DarkSakura.
I mean, the opening visuals, although a little long, were very good.
I mean, I loved it, and I did love some of the backgrounds and graphics used, and the music was okay.
I didn't really pay attention to it, because it didn't seem to blend in, so I couldn't hear the music.
I was just too busy focusing on the screen.
I think the problem is that so many people were talking so much hype about it, I felt like I was going to get this game
and I was going to go outside and start touching people and healing them because I was getting the way that God powers something.
Like maybe the artsiness of the game was hyped up too much?
Yeah, which probably explains why I didn't like Braid so much.
Oh, I still love Braid.
It's a great game.
I mean, yeah, some people, like the people that like to smell their own farts are really into, oh, Braid is an experience.
But I just think Braid's a solid game.
For like a download title, it's just, it's fun.
The hype killed it.
The hype killed it.
The hype killed it.
Yes, and the ambiguous storyline sort of left me feeling... left me feeling a sense of blue balls.
Yeah.
What the hell just happened?
What did I just play?
Let's try to wrap on a positive note.
What did you enjoy on Child of Eden?
You said you were left with mixed feelings, so there was some good.
What was the good that you liked?
The fact that, like I said, after I got used to Kinect controls and used to the gameplay, I figured, okay, it's kind of like Rez, but a little easier because Rez at a few points got to be really insanely hard to the point of where you had to time everything precisely, otherwise it just didn't work.
so but Charlie just played a lot easier and it flowed a little better so you know I was okay with it I thought it was a good game I just didn't think it was God's gift to game but I thought it was a really good game though well and I think I think the best news of all is you only paid $10 for it most people paid $50 so yeah and the craziest part was the pre-owned was $35 uh that's a little backwards I know there you go I wonder how many people bought those just to sell them back to another store
Make some money.
All right.
DDR Dollar Bill, any other thoughts tonight?
I had them and they went out the window, unfortunately.
You got to write them down.
All right.
Send us an email then when you think of them.
Alright, take it easy guys Alright, have a good one buddy, take care Bye
Right?
Remember?
Yeah.
In person.
I mean, I knew you online, but it was the first time I met you in person.
Because I found Spike, and you were with Spike, I think.
No, I was with Frat Matt, actually.
Yeah, and I was like... But I've known him for a long time.
And we've been following each other on LiveJournal for years, and then right when we shook hands, the lights went down to go sit.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and I don't remember what episode number it is I'm sure it's on the OLR wiki somewhere and it was a few years ago so it's back there it was in the episode 200 somewhere probably but it was great and check that out it was a long interview maybe somebody in chat will shout it out some of the OLR historians who know their wiki really well will
I had a really good time at Video Games Live, so I think it's worth seeing at least once in your life.
Do you agree, Alan?
Did you like Video Games Live?
Yeah.
Good stuff.
Let's go to the phones.
We're getting another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Yo, it's Xenocore from the OKC.
How y'all doing?
Hello, OKC, Xenocore.
What is up, buddy?
Not much, not much.
I hope everybody's been paying attention to what the hell Good Old Games has been doing lately because I've been playing the hell out of my copy of Wing Commander 1 and 2.
I have not had the chance to bring this up.
I was thinking of it during the break and I forgot.
Thank you for reminding me.
I did play Good Old Games this week.
I finally made an account on there.
But do you know, it wasn't the Wing Commander thing that put me over the edge, although I think that's awesome.
It was the fact that they were giving away Ultima 4, Quest of the Avatar, for free.
Oh yeah, that's right.
I did hear about that one too.
God, I miss the Ultima series.
It was a great series.
I mean, yes, I realize there's still Ultima Online and all that stuff, but man, the Ultima series was a great series.
And you know they were going to make a tenth one a few years ago and it was a cancelled project?
Yeah, it was a full 3D engine and everything and I think it just got too big for what they were planning on.
Yeah, it's unfortunate.
But yes, I made a...
GOG account this week to get my copy of Ultima 4 even though I could probably download a copy on an abandoned aware site somewhere but what I love about good old games or at least so far that I've experienced is that they have the little DOS box thing fine tuned to work like I don't have to think about all these settings on how to emulate it just works and I like that I like that it just works
Yeah, it's worth the six bucks, especially with the Wing Commander packs, since you're getting both Wing Commander 1 and 2, and the secret missions, I think, for both 1 and 2.
And on top of that, they actually have what I think is the game development bible for Wing Commander 1 and 2, because it covers...
Every character, every facet of the game through Win Commander 1, Secret Operations, Win Commander 2, and 3.
So it's like, good lord, this is a 50 megabyte PDF file.
What the hell's in this thing?
And literally, it's like the resource document for game design.
So it's like, that's kind of cool.
And on top of my purchase of Crusader, Nora Morrison, it's like, I gotta give props to these guys.
They're finally getting the games I want to buy from them, so...
Good Old Games is... If you are like, why don't they make games like they used to?
Or you just want to play something from your youth that doesn't seem to work on the computer, check out Good Old Games.
I will say this, their library isn't vast right now.
One of the first games I went to go look up on Good Old Games, because I would have paid $10 for this game if I could find it.
It's a Sid Meier game that's not civilization, it's not even colonization.
and this is actually one of the games he in retrospect says it wasn't very good because they tried to be too ambitious with it but I disagree and it's covert action Sid Meier's Covert Action is like this James Bond-ish type of game and it's problem was that it was basically four separate games all thrown together but I love Covert Action and I was hoping it was on good old games but it's not not going to be sad but maybe soon I was hoping they'd pick up that one game Spycraft that they ran back in like the
Early 90s, that was all full motion video and stuff and all James Bond-esque.
Even had live torture in there.
It was kind of weird.
HitStun in our chat, by the way, is verifying it's still free right now as of the time we're recording and put a link in chat at GOG.com for Ultima 4 if you want to check it out.
Yeah, so everybody go get it now!
Go on!
Do it now!
Anyway, that's all I had.
Make sure you love your old games, guys.
Show your old game some love.
I think that was a great tip.
Thank you for bringing it up because I wanted to mention GOG, but I got sidetracked with all the Disney talk.
Well, here I am putting you back on, Shag.
All right.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
Looking out for us.
All right.
Take care.
All right.
Bye.
All right.
Interesting.
We've had a lot of calls that are tonight kind of endorsing online services.
It's kind of neat.
Wow.
Some people in chat remember Covert Action.
I feel loved.
DDR Dollar Bill says, fuck yeah.
And Kai Judo says, Covert Action is the best.
I love that game.
Oh, my God.
Uh, Actdeft, by the way, also went in the wiki and found it was episode 285 from June 29th, 2008, had the Tommy Tallarico interview.
That would have been right around our 7th anniversary show.
It was probably the weekend before.
So, hmm, there you go, 285.
As to where you can find episode 285, come into chat.orange.com at some point.
And hell, I might have it still somewhere.
But I'm sure some folks like DarkTetsuya and so forth have the old episodes.
And it might even be on theolarchive.tk.
Our FTP server, thanks to the generosity of the web people that put it on, including VxJasonXV, who's just the man that helps our website have a place to be, upped our FTP some time ago.
So we haven't actually deleted anything from the FTP in like one or two years.
So it might still be on the FTP, I'm just not sure.
So...
One thing that I thought was funny about that Video Games Live performance we went to is that I feel that Bay Area geeks are kind of pretentious in how serious they take everything.
And that Video Games Live was where they debuted their orchestra performance of Time Scar.
Oh, Scar of Time.
Scar of Time from Chrono Cross.
And it was like a medley with the big song from Chrono Trigger.
And it was like the world premiere performance.
and everyone of course loved it but we were all so serious in the audience that like no one made a peep because it was such an awesome moment for those beautiful songs to be played but I think Tommy Tallarico was like like he didn't like it's like they're all just dead in the audience but we were just all in the moment everybody was just really into it like Bay Area people don't fuck around
Yeah, and he kept, for us to play this next song, everyone stand up and say, yeah!
And like, pump your fists and we're like, we don't do that here, bro.
We're very serious.
We don't hoot and holler in San Francisco.
We're serious business.
I think that kind of went against his personality.
But also, Tommy does great things.
I'm not slamming what he does.
But I think to do that fist pump for Chrono Cross, you fist pump for Halo.
You fist pump for those other types of high energy games.
I'm not saying that Chrono Cross is a boring game or whatever, but it's just role playing games are a little different.
It's art, damn it.
Yes, thank you.
It's art, damn it.
Alright, there's hella people in our chatroom that are like, fuck yeah, free Ultima 4.
I will say this, I had Ultima 4 on the NES.
It was so good.
Like, it's hard as fuck, but it is good.
It's a good game.
Alright, anyhow, back to tweets.
We keep getting derailed from tweets tonight.
Let's see, going to Redertainment.
Which game coming out holiday do you think will be the biggest bust?
I think Skyrim will disappoint, but Uncharted 3 will sell poorly.
Ooh, that's an interesting question.
Redertainment says, which game do you think will be the biggest bust this holiday?
I actually disagree.
I think Skyrim's gonna do awesome, but that's total fanboy in me.
What do you think?
Loki, you're grinning over there.
What game do you think will be a bust?
Skylanders!
I fucking hate Skylanders.
I hope it burns.
Oh, is that the game with the pets and stuff?
It's a game from Activision starring Spyro.
Skylanders, Spyro's Adventure.
Fuck that game.
Yes, you ranted about this before.
Burns and Fire.
See, I would have said Star Wars Connect, but they already bumped it to 2012.
So now I'm in a predicament.
What do I say is going to disappoint this holiday?
I don't know.
I feel like everything that might have disappointed got bumped to Christmas.
I don't think I can say the 3DS because it's no longer got the Vita to compete with.
Well, I could say one, but it's probably just a no-brainer, Silent Hill.
Yeah, but I don't even consider that a big title with high expectations.
I don't know.
I don't know what would possibly disappoint.
GoldenEye Reloaded?
Somebody's going to really hate me for saying this.
I think the game will be great, but Dance Central 2, I don't think it's going to be quite as huge of a deal as the first one, and it's because the market has been saturated.
Because now you have the Just Dance and so forth.
I hope it doesn't, but I don't know.
There's this weird part of me that's kind of like, I don't think it's going to make waves like the first one did.
I hope I'm wrong.
I hope I'm wrong, because I really like those games, but I just think the market's going to be very saturated.
Night of the Old Republic MMO
Now this isn't the solution I was looking for.
That's a clever response.
I like that.
All right.
Anyhow, moving on to other tweets.
Spazernator sends us some very interesting tweets.
Well, it finally happened.
I have become an ex-bot.
Fuck Sony.
I'll pirate their shit before I buy any of their stuff again.
Sorry I won't be in chat.
Personal stuff going on.
Now, if you've been listening to Orange Launch Radio for the past, I don't know, couple years, Spazinator calls in pretty reliably once a month, if not a little more often than that, and talks about the latest going on on PSN, especially the video marketplace.
But he's also run into some major issues when it comes to, he's had like three of them break down on him.
so I'm very curious to see what sent him over the edge like was it one more breakdown was it one bad customer service call like I've gotta know like what fucking just cause I would not see those tweets coming from Spazinator like what fucking broke him like I've gotta know I've gotta know right yeah and he had problems where he would buy games and then he would get a new console but they wouldn't unlock his games for him yeah he had a lot of problems with them I don't know
so PodCulture sent us a tweet that says hello from DragonCon so we want to say hello right back to PodCulture sorry you and Bobby couldn't get on the show tonight we had a late start live we miss you guys and congrats on your Parsec award that you won for your podcast the TARDIS Interruptus the name escaped me for a minute there but thank you the Doctor Who podcast
Moving on to some tweets from Tigerclaw.
A couple tweets here.
I read this right before the show.
This is fascinating to me.
League of Legends shutting down Mac support, tweets Tigerclaw.
A story that after a year of beta testing, Riot Games is just canceling Mac OS support for League of Legends.
It will be ending at midnight on Tuesday.
They have said quote our current approach regarding the Mac platform won't guarantee the quality and frequent updates we deliver today on the PC.
They're not ruling out a Mac version in the future.
They say they are committed to building a solution that will work on the Mac in the long run but it will take some time.
The shutdown will be effective midnight on September 6th.
Now, the beta testers who used League of Legends, they can either get a full refund if they use the store, or they can keep their accounts open and play on a PC.
All the Mac players will get a code for a champion pack.
A Mac player means that the majority of the logins came from the Mac client.
Those have to also be redeemed before Tuesday.
So if you're a Mac player, League of Legends, go get your free ship before they shut it down.
Right?
Pretty much is what it is.
That's a bummer.
Let's see, also another tweet here.
He sent us a tweet about that whole Comcast story.
It's not directly related to games, but did you hear about how Comcast, in a nutshell, Hurricane Irene happened and shut down the power, and Comcast won't refund people for it because they say, eh, it's an act of God.
What if you don't believe in God?
Tricky... No, you're right.
It could be.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I don't believe in God.
They consider a hurricane part of that.
But here's the thing.
Why don't they just call it Active Nature?
You can't dispute.
It is nature.
Whatever.
I'm not going to get into that because it's way too controversial for our little video game show.
However, I will say this.
It's not that I'm siding with Comcast in this.
I kind of just think you should do the Goodwill thing and it was a pretty big event.
You should just chip in the extra couple days of internet and suck it up.
But, I mean, you guys, you guys, power outages are gonna happen, and, like, you will be without cable TV, and, you know, it's just gonna happen.
I understand that, but they're, you know, the power company doesn't charge me for power that I'm using when there's no power.
And you know what?
Comcast could easily fucking bury their goddamn lines in the ground, we wouldn't have any of this problem.
I do think they should just suck it up and do it out of goodwill but I also at the same time I'm just saying you know what these are risks you take and I kind of think it's justified a little bit I think it's bad at customer relations but it's not a legal business decision I just think it's not going to keep people in their good graces that's all
When I worked at Pac Bell and we had a two or three day outage of DSL broadband in a certain area or just like our email service went down for a couple days, we would say, okay, you're paying 20 bucks a month.
It was down for three days.
I have supervisor approval to refund you for seven cents.
And of course, the customer would go completely batshit.
But it's like this.
It's in our terms and conditions that we have outages.
Yeah.
and you're agreeing to deal with that.
Sorry, it's probably not the popular response you were hoping from us angry people at OLR, but you have to kind of look at both sides of it.
I'm just happy that the hurricane didn't end up being as horrific as they thought.
I mean, yes, I understand Vermont flooded and some people were in bad situations and that really sucks.
However, I'm glad it wasn't as terrible as they were saying in the beginning, right?
Like we were thinking it was going to be even worse.
So I'm just really glad it wasn't even worse.
Anyhow, one more tweet from Tigerclaw.
And this is interesting because it's about... I didn't hear about this for the show tonight, but I guess there is an Uncharted 3 trailer that is out.
And it is a Portuguese trailer.
And they did a version of it that I guess...
I guess the way they translated the trailer or whatever and the way the voices sound and so forth isn't going over very well in Brazil.
And they're going to Naughty Dog's forums to just basically yell at people and say that you don't even know what the hell you're doing, basically.
It's kind of like, you know when you get a really bad English dub here?
Like, come on, who didn't see one of those videos for Heavy Rain?
Jason!
Jason!
Like, you know, and it was very obviously French people doing English accents.
It's kind of like that similar thing, but we take a lot of that for granted because if it's English, between that and Japanese, the two languages used in most games, we just take for granted that the other languages probably sound alright too, and this is a case where it doesn't.
There you go.
All right, and a couple more tweets here.
DarkDetsuya tweeted us and said, Here's confirmation.
The Anaheim move for WonderCon was confirmed.
There will not be WonderCon in San Francisco next year.
It's in Anaheim.
Moscone Center is being completely, like that wing of it is being shut down for renovations.
So the weekend that they would want to have it.
No choice.
Yeah.
No choice.
and lastly tonight Shadley Lund tweets us saying forgot to mention on the phone Dance Central 2 crews are awesome and it sounds like they have big plans for them reminds me of Bust a Groove, Bust a Move now those were good fucking games I just saw a little gameplay clip of one of those games the other night and I was like god I miss those games Bust a Move as it's more properly called had a third game for the PS2
Oh god, it had that wacky controller.
Shane has it.
He brought it.
Dance Summit is what it was called.
I completely missed it.
I didn't even hear about it until last year.
So, we are running so late tonight that the press event for Dragon Quest X has started.
It's now 10 o'clock on the West Coast, 1 p.m.
This has been a long fucking show tonight.
I'm going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
It wasn't ringing anyway.
I think we got everybody they wanted to get through.
I will ask Loki real quick, though, if there's any last-minute stories tonight.
