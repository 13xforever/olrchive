00:00.000 --> 00:20.020
Today, September 18th, 2011, Nintendo reveals the future of the 3DS and its pink.

00:20.020 --> 00:24.620
The PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch, and Sony adds a controversial new

00:24.620 --> 00:31.620
section to the PSN terms of service.

00:31.620 --> 00:35.580
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.580 --> 00:39.660
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.660 --> 00:44.760
My name is Rob Roberts and joining you live here on this September 18th, 2011 for episode

00:44.760 --> 00:50.860
number 428 with my co-hosts, first off, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie

00:50.860 --> 00:51.860
Summers.

00:51.860 --> 00:54.360
We're also the show where every gamer has access to chicken.

00:54.360 --> 00:55.460
You can ask him if you want.

00:55.460 --> 00:56.460
I see.

00:56.460 --> 00:57.460
Yes.

00:57.460 --> 00:58.460
Dark Sakura's eating chicken.

00:58.460 --> 01:01.320
Tech master Loki is in the house over here as well and he's eating chicken.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.320
Yeah.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.320
And I am chickenless.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.320
But I do have-

01:04.320 --> 01:05.320
You can have some chicken.

01:05.320 --> 01:06.320
I do.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.320
No, it's okay.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.320
I actually don't really want chicken.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.320
I have a pumpkin spice frappuccino.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.320
So I'm good.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.320
I had a pumpkin spice latte.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.660
I had one of those brunches that was so big, like I'm still full.

01:14.660 --> 01:16.980
So I'm just like, I'm not even hungry.

01:16.980 --> 01:17.980
It's weird.

01:17.980 --> 01:18.980
I can't explain it.

01:18.980 --> 01:19.980
Okay.

01:19.980 --> 01:20.980
Anyhow.

01:20.980 --> 01:24.580
By the way, I'm still laughing my ass off over that Cracked article.

01:24.580 --> 01:26.340
Which was, what is this article you were reading about?

01:26.340 --> 01:31.420
It was one of those little photo shop things where they do rejected book covers and one

01:31.420 --> 01:34.740
of them was, it's okay to be a douchebag by Ayn Rand.

01:34.740 --> 01:37.460
You know what's interesting about that website is they have really made, you know, I'm not

01:37.460 --> 01:38.460
knocking it.

01:38.460 --> 01:39.460
This is just what I've noticed about them.

01:39.460 --> 01:42.660
An observation, if you will, they really seem to have made a name for themselves.

01:42.660 --> 01:46.500
I always thought, wasn't Cracked like a magazine, like the answer to Mad Magazine like 20 years

01:46.500 --> 01:47.500
ago?

01:47.500 --> 01:48.500
I think so.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.500
It was Mad Magazine Lite.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.500
Does that still exist?

01:50.500 --> 01:51.500
Mad Magazine.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.500
I don't even know.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.540
But now what I notice is that Cracked is on like dig in those websites all the time because

01:55.540 --> 01:58.740
it's like they specialize in top 10 lists or something like that.

01:58.740 --> 01:59.740
I think it's awesome.

01:59.740 --> 02:01.460
That's all they do is like lists.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.500
I'm going to do one for them.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.020
Do they take user submitted articles?

02:05.020 --> 02:09.100
They, well they do, but they also, the better, like the better that they are, like they'll

02:09.100 --> 02:10.980
start paying you for them or something.

02:10.980 --> 02:11.980
There you go.

02:11.980 --> 02:12.980
Okay, cool.

02:12.980 --> 02:13.980
New industry for you.

02:13.980 --> 02:17.480
Hey, I want you to join our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

02:17.480 --> 02:21.920
We do tape our show live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern

02:21.920 --> 02:27.060
live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:27.060 --> 02:30.760
Although to be fair, Bobby had the night off tonight, but nevermind if you're listening

02:30.760 --> 02:34.300
on the podcast and you've never heard a live show before, he'll be back next week.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.380
So again, if you are listening to us live at All Games Radio though, join us in the

02:37.380 --> 02:38.380
chat room.

02:38.380 --> 02:43.140
Again, that's chat.orangelaungeradio.com where we do often read comments from chat tonight,

02:43.140 --> 02:47.660
which actually I got to admit, chats a little more dead than I usually see it.

02:47.660 --> 02:51.060
And I don't know if that's just, we didn't have a lead in tonight cause Bobby was off

02:51.060 --> 02:53.140
or is it the Emmys?

02:53.140 --> 02:54.880
Like is everybody off watching the Emmys?

02:54.880 --> 02:55.880
Like I know that's our competition.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.600
We are always up against some stupid award show.

02:58.600 --> 03:03.280
Like Sunday night is like the night to have an award show in Hollywood and et cetera.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.280
And tonight it's the Emmys.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.280
The shmemmys.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.940
I don't know the Emmys or whatever.

03:08.940 --> 03:10.620
I barely watch any TV.

03:10.620 --> 03:15.020
I can't wait till it's over so I can see Kathy Griffin's roast of the Emmys.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.500
Is that a thing she does now?

03:16.500 --> 03:20.340
She's doing something now where she like bashes the Emmys when it's over.

03:20.340 --> 03:24.100
Didn't she get all that hate mail one year cause she said something at the Emmys?

03:24.100 --> 03:26.660
She said, Jesus has nothing to do with me winning this award.

03:26.660 --> 03:27.660
Oh yeah, yeah.

03:27.660 --> 03:28.660
Oh boy.

03:28.660 --> 03:29.660
All right.

03:29.660 --> 03:30.660
Crazy lady.

03:30.660 --> 03:31.660
Uh, anyhow.

03:31.660 --> 03:35.180
Uh, also speaking of Emmys, actually Emmys kind of had me thinking about like video game

03:35.180 --> 03:39.660
television today and kind of like how, you know, I don't think we'll ever see a video

03:39.660 --> 03:43.660
game show nominated for an Emmy, although I'm sure there's some type of technical award

03:43.660 --> 03:44.660
or something.

03:44.660 --> 03:49.780
Some has won, but what part of the shmemmys, what is it about video game TV?

03:49.780 --> 03:53.660
Like why hasn't there really been a lot of good video game TV?

03:53.660 --> 03:58.740
And I know, I know some folks out there are fans of X play and some folks might be fans

03:58.740 --> 04:00.580
of attack of the show, although I don't know.

04:00.580 --> 04:03.660
I don't even know if attack of the show is really like a gaming show anymore, more than

04:03.660 --> 04:09.340
it is just like a testosterone filled young guys kind of show.

04:09.340 --> 04:10.340
I don't know.

04:10.340 --> 04:14.820
Like the last video game show I remember myself getting really excited about was Nick arcade.

04:14.820 --> 04:18.540
Like that was an awesome or star K do you want to go like way back back in the eighties

04:18.540 --> 04:21.000
like the video game game shows.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
So I don't know.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.220
Are there any video game TV shows you guys have ever been into or are into?

04:26.220 --> 04:33.000
I was, um, I watched that one and I can never remember the name of it where, um, they would

04:33.000 --> 04:40.020
send the team through this like labyrinth with, uh, these Velcro vests and they would

04:40.020 --> 04:41.540
attach the prizes to their vest.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.260
I vaguely remember that.

04:43.260 --> 04:44.260
Yeah.

04:44.260 --> 04:45.260
Yeah.

04:45.260 --> 04:46.260
Yeah.

04:46.260 --> 04:47.260
And it was on Saturday morning after my cartoons.

04:47.260 --> 04:51.880
So I would watch it all the time and I was like, you can't stick a turbo graphics to

04:51.880 --> 04:53.300
your front, put it on your back.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.980
They were empty boxes.

04:54.980 --> 04:58.340
Probably it was just props or something like that, but I needed to grab games and stuff

04:58.340 --> 04:59.340
and it was pretty cool.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.340
Yeah.

05:00.340 --> 05:01.660
I know what you're talking about.

05:01.660 --> 05:06.580
I can't remember the name of it was, um, that was like something like labyrinth or something.

05:06.580 --> 05:09.940
But no, it wasn't that it was, it had this guy.

05:09.940 --> 05:12.780
I'm sure somebody in chat was probably JD Ross.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.400
He's in every goddamn eighties game show.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.740
Do you know what he's done now?

05:17.740 --> 05:18.740
Thank you.

05:18.740 --> 05:19.740
Wikipedia.

05:19.740 --> 05:20.740
Do you know what he does now?

05:20.740 --> 05:21.740
The big show that he's a producer, right?

05:21.740 --> 05:24.940
Yeah, he's a producer, but there's a really big show on TV that he, you can thank him

05:24.940 --> 05:25.940
for.

05:25.940 --> 05:28.420
The biggest loser is his thing.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.220
Well, how appropriate for him.

05:30.220 --> 05:35.180
There was another show that was on to that he will always be fun house to me.

05:35.180 --> 05:36.180
I'm sorry.

05:36.180 --> 05:37.180
Okay.

05:37.180 --> 05:38.180
That's what it was fun.

05:38.180 --> 05:39.180
No way.

05:39.180 --> 05:40.180
It wasn't fun.

05:40.180 --> 05:41.180
The fun house was like the double dare turned up to 11.

05:41.180 --> 05:46.540
Um, but it was also, um, well you remember that, that show, what was it?

05:46.540 --> 05:49.980
The quest of the kingdom or something that, but that's not one of the thing of, there's

05:49.980 --> 05:55.140
another guy who had Brown hair, he'd always wear like a member's only jacket.

05:55.140 --> 05:56.140
This was the eighties.

05:56.140 --> 05:57.140
Is that John Davidson?

05:57.140 --> 06:00.180
Wasn't he on Hollywood squares?

06:00.180 --> 06:04.660
He sat in a chair that looked a lot like captain Kirk's chair.

06:04.660 --> 06:10.180
And I remember the show very much because they did a big special on the Neo Geo and

06:10.180 --> 06:13.940
about taking the cards and switching them out, you know, putting them in the machine,

06:13.940 --> 06:17.320
saving your game and coming home and playing it at home.

06:17.320 --> 06:21.780
And I, for the life of me, I cannot remember what the name of the show was.

06:21.780 --> 06:24.740
Let me ask this question while you guys try to think of the show or while the chatters

06:24.740 --> 06:27.300
that shout it out.

06:27.300 --> 06:32.540
Why, why is it that video game, video power, why is it that video game television hasn't

06:32.540 --> 06:33.540
really seemed to work?

06:33.540 --> 06:37.200
And I mean, there, there has been a few exceptions, like, you know, I know some of you guys dig

06:37.200 --> 06:38.200
X play.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.140
I know there's that show on spike TV that gets to break a lot of exclusives.

06:41.140 --> 06:44.300
The one that Jeff Keeley does, you know, there's been a few things here and there, but like,

06:44.300 --> 06:48.580
you know, G4 TV was supposed to be all about video games, but you know, it didn't work

06:48.580 --> 06:52.660
cause it went like this whole different direction where it's aimed towards young guys.

06:52.660 --> 06:56.260
Like is it just that, you know, we're too busy wanting to play video games, then watch

06:56.260 --> 06:58.440
people talk about it on the TV?

06:58.440 --> 07:01.320
Like why doesn't it work?

07:01.320 --> 07:05.080
It's because it's too niche of an audience and it's hard for them to convince people

07:05.080 --> 07:10.040
to sponsor the shows or put advertisements on the show because they're not getting as

07:10.040 --> 07:15.260
many views as normal, especially in nowadays, you know, it's kind of irrelevant to have

07:15.260 --> 07:20.180
a video game show unless you can lock in those kinds of exclusive interviews and sneak peeks

07:20.180 --> 07:25.920
and stuff like that, that you can't do on the internet because you know, internet's

07:25.920 --> 07:31.700
faster than TV or print media and that's just the way it is unless they're breaking news.

07:31.700 --> 07:32.700
That's kind of the way it goes.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.140
I'm positive one of them was video power.

07:35.140 --> 07:37.140
You know, we have a story coming up later tonight.

07:37.140 --> 07:41.620
I'm not going to totally get into it now, but you know, one of the big consoles is launching

07:41.620 --> 07:45.180
a TV related thing and we'll talk more about that later.

07:45.180 --> 07:48.460
But that does kind of seem to be like the future, especially when we talk a lot about

07:48.460 --> 07:54.620
like a video on demand and how huge Netflix and Hulu and all that stuff has been on PlayStation

07:54.620 --> 07:56.380
as well as Xbox.

07:56.380 --> 08:00.780
And do you think it's possible that as these consoles become more like entertainment devices,

08:00.780 --> 08:04.380
like almost for some people may be replacing cable someday.

08:04.380 --> 08:05.380
I don't know.

08:05.380 --> 08:08.420
Do you think we'll see more gaming related content on those consoles?

08:08.420 --> 08:13.340
Well, yeah, if it's on a console, I can imagine that they're going to try to put some gaming

08:13.340 --> 08:14.740
related content on there.

08:14.740 --> 08:18.980
They'll probably feel like infomercials more than anything like kind of like the, you know,

08:18.980 --> 08:22.940
majors minute on Xbox 360 is as nice as that is.

08:22.940 --> 08:23.940
Let's let's be real.

08:23.940 --> 08:26.780
It's just a product awareness thing for for Microsoft, right?

08:26.780 --> 08:27.780
Yeah.

08:27.780 --> 08:32.820
Well, I'm trying to find there is an article I saw talking about some new video game shows

08:32.820 --> 08:37.180
coming and it was by the guy that did like The Room or something like that.

08:37.180 --> 08:40.860
Not Silent Hill The Room, but like actually like the horrible cult movie The Room.

08:40.860 --> 08:41.860
Yes.

08:41.860 --> 08:42.860
The horrible cult movie.

08:42.860 --> 08:43.860
It's actually him.

08:43.860 --> 08:44.860
Yeah.

08:44.860 --> 08:45.860
And it looks so fucking terrible.

08:45.860 --> 08:49.500
I can't remember what the parody or it's a joke or something.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.300
I don't think it is all to take too seriously.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.820
I am your something.

08:52.820 --> 08:53.820
Interesting.

08:53.820 --> 08:54.820
I don't remember what it was.

08:54.820 --> 08:56.380
It's just retarded for the record.

08:56.380 --> 08:59.620
The show, both shows I was thinking of is actually the same show, but different seasons

08:59.620 --> 09:01.820
of it.

09:01.820 --> 09:04.660
It's video power, video power because it started off as like a tip show and then it became

09:04.660 --> 09:05.660
a game show.

09:05.660 --> 09:06.660
Oh yeah.

09:06.660 --> 09:07.660
I remember that one.

09:07.660 --> 09:08.660
Yeah.

09:08.660 --> 09:09.660
It was like game show.

09:09.660 --> 09:10.660
It had tips.

09:10.660 --> 09:11.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:11.660 --> 09:12.660
But no, it started off I think it's just tips.

09:12.660 --> 09:13.660
Interesting.

09:13.660 --> 09:14.660
And it was like 1990, 1991.

09:14.660 --> 09:15.660
I thought it was earlier than that.

09:15.660 --> 09:16.660
Yeah.

09:16.660 --> 09:17.660
It was like in the mid 80s.

09:17.660 --> 09:18.660
I'm going to double check.

09:18.660 --> 09:19.660
I don't know.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.660
Um, let's see.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.660
What else do I want to say?

09:21.660 --> 09:27.660
Oh, Oh, I know what I wanted to say about like television on the consoles and so forth.

09:27.660 --> 09:31.700
Like this, this is still a sore point for me to this day.

09:31.700 --> 09:32.700
1992.

09:32.700 --> 09:33.700
Wow.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.700
Was it really?

09:34.700 --> 09:35.940
In two different formats from 1990 through 92.

09:35.940 --> 09:36.940
Gosh.

09:36.940 --> 09:37.940
I'm, I'm with Dan in the other room.

09:37.940 --> 09:39.340
I thought it was way earlier than that.

09:39.340 --> 09:42.620
Of course Wikipedia is always right 100% of the time, right?

09:42.620 --> 09:44.220
Directed by Stevie Piskoski.

09:44.220 --> 09:46.300
I'm going to double check IMDB.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.860
Um, let me, let me hit on this.

09:48.860 --> 09:52.340
I want to mention this and that is, you know, one thing that I think would have made an

09:52.340 --> 10:00.420
awesome television show would have been, um, the one versus 100 on Xbox 360.

10:00.420 --> 10:05.580
Like I really feel like Microsoft was sitting on a gold mine with that and they let it go.

10:05.580 --> 10:09.500
And I don't know if it's because of licensing reasons or what have you, but man, I know

10:09.500 --> 10:11.380
so many people that were so into that.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.000
It's really weird that they let it go.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.600
And it really made me think like, why hasn't like game show network tried to pick up like

10:17.600 --> 10:20.380
an actual game show that runs through consoles or something?

10:20.380 --> 10:21.380
I don't know.

10:21.380 --> 10:22.380
All right.

10:22.380 --> 10:23.380
I found it.

10:23.380 --> 10:28.260
It's called the Tommy Wee Show and it's featuring Tommy Wiseau.

10:28.260 --> 10:35.460
And basically it's supposed to be this weird, I don't know, uh, they're saying it's, it's

10:35.460 --> 10:38.940
going to be, um, presented by Makima.

10:38.940 --> 10:46.060
And it's basically, it follows him as he repeatedly gets abducted by different races of mysterious

10:46.060 --> 10:51.060
aliens transported to distant planets where he's forced to test popular video games.

10:51.060 --> 10:56.900
So it's, it's a terrible idea ripped off of Mystery Science Theater 3000 with this guy

10:56.900 --> 11:00.460
that looks like he's the undertaker or something like that.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.460
It's just ridiculous.

11:01.460 --> 11:02.460
I don't know.

11:02.460 --> 11:04.660
Hey, guess what?

11:04.660 --> 11:05.660
No one care.

11:05.660 --> 11:06.660
All right.

11:06.660 --> 11:10.340
So the screen, like where the screen freezes, he looks like he's about to throw up or you

11:10.340 --> 11:11.980
know, fall asleep or something or both.

11:11.980 --> 11:15.300
It's wherever this, that guy is very strange.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.300
Anyhow.

11:16.300 --> 11:21.700
Um, yeah, so I'm, I'm a little upset that, that Microsoft kind of let that thing go,

11:21.700 --> 11:23.780
but I guess it wasn't very profitable for them or whatever.

11:23.780 --> 11:27.180
They're probably losing money on it, but I think they should still revisit it at some

11:27.180 --> 11:28.180
point.

11:28.180 --> 11:31.380
Oh, one other, uh, we'll get into our gaming weeks here in a minute, but one other like

11:31.380 --> 11:37.020
game slash TV related thing that I can think of that I know is coming soon is the whole,

11:37.020 --> 11:42.540
um, uh, sci-fi TV show that's supposed to be like tied into an MMO.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.060
Like I can't, I just, it popped in my head.

11:44.060 --> 11:45.660
It was something I think they had talked about at E3.

11:45.660 --> 11:46.820
Do you remember anything about that?

11:46.820 --> 11:47.820
Loki?

11:47.820 --> 11:48.820
It was like some time.

11:48.820 --> 11:49.820
I know what you're talking about, but I don't know what the hell it's called.

11:49.820 --> 11:52.660
And nor do I care.

11:52.660 --> 11:53.660
It's a sci-fi show.

11:53.660 --> 11:55.660
I mean, come on.

11:55.660 --> 11:59.820
Um, one game series that I actually watched while there was a bunch of old ones, you know,

11:59.820 --> 12:04.140
back in the eighties and nineties and stuff, game shows, you know, for sure.

12:04.140 --> 12:13.020
Um, but I watched, um, well X play when, um, or extended play back when it was, you know,

12:13.020 --> 12:15.820
tech TV, I used to watch that all the time.

12:15.820 --> 12:20.460
Um, even next play, I used to watch it when it was G4 tech TV.

12:20.460 --> 12:27.060
Um, and then of course, Starrcade, which was, you know, rerun like hell on that network

12:27.060 --> 12:30.900
before it started sucking, um, and they got rid of it.

12:30.900 --> 12:35.460
Um, what was the other one that was, yeah, portal was kind of lame.

12:35.460 --> 12:37.060
They had that on there.

12:37.060 --> 12:41.820
Um, I just watched all the online reviews now.

12:41.820 --> 12:45.500
It's called Dave, where you go running around in MMOs and they do mock you.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.260
Wasn't that the one that Wil Wheaton hosted or was that?

12:48.260 --> 12:49.260
No.

12:49.260 --> 12:50.260
Oh.

12:50.260 --> 12:56.300
I just really watch YouTube like, like the Angry Video Game Nerd and you know, uh, crap.

12:56.300 --> 12:59.740
What's that other one that you watch?

12:59.740 --> 13:00.740
Classic Game Room.

13:00.740 --> 13:01.740
Classic Game Room is pretty cool.

13:01.740 --> 13:02.740
Maybe that's it.

13:02.740 --> 13:06.660
Everybody's turning to YouTube now and amateur programming such as, uh, the show you're listening

13:06.660 --> 13:11.060
to right now, although we're more radio than TV, but hey, we have a YouTube channel.

13:11.060 --> 13:12.980
We just don't like really do anything with it.

13:12.980 --> 13:14.220
There you go.

13:14.220 --> 13:19.820
So I use mind of post pic, uh, videos of Shermy and, uh, my best friend's son.

13:19.820 --> 13:20.820
Hmm.

13:20.820 --> 13:26.220
I post grants that thought of related videos and one video that had an uploaded trailer.

13:26.220 --> 13:29.300
So I can link it on a newsletter I was doing.

13:29.300 --> 13:33.460
Funny enough, that trailer got more comments than most of my other videos I put on there

13:33.460 --> 13:36.260
because it's some really crappy hunting game.

13:36.260 --> 13:38.860
Hey, you know what?

13:38.860 --> 13:39.860
I don't care if it sucks.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.620
I had to put the trailer up there.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.620
All right.

13:42.620 --> 13:47.140
Tiger call mentioned, um, something about a Gun Stringer game that was put out by Troma.

13:47.140 --> 13:49.340
You know what Troma did, right?

13:49.340 --> 13:50.340
Toxic Avenger movies.

13:50.340 --> 13:54.060
I was gonna say they do all the like really campy B movie stuff, like Troma and Juliet

13:54.060 --> 13:55.260
and stuff, right?

13:55.260 --> 13:56.460
It's just, it's SARS.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.460
What's his name from?

13:57.460 --> 13:58.460
Troma.

13:58.460 --> 14:02.460
Um, Lloyd McCoffin or Kaufman or whatever.

14:02.460 --> 14:03.460
He's in there.

14:03.460 --> 14:04.460
Um, yeah.

14:04.460 --> 14:05.460
All right.

14:05.460 --> 14:12.100
Let's stop trying to get into the stories that we make up for later on bastard.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.100
Let's move.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.100
You listen, you don't control the show.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.100
Okay.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.100
Now I don't care.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.760
We don't, I don't think we're even talking about that tonight.

14:17.760 --> 14:18.760
Let's move on.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.760
Let's talk about our gaming week.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.860
So I always like to start off the show talking about what kind of games we've been playing

14:22.860 --> 14:23.860
this week.

14:23.860 --> 14:24.860
Dark soccer.

14:24.860 --> 14:25.860
Wow.

14:25.860 --> 14:26.860
Wow.

14:26.860 --> 14:28.820
As in the worlds of Warcrafts.

14:28.820 --> 14:29.820
Wow.

14:29.820 --> 14:30.820
Nerd.

14:30.820 --> 14:31.820
Wow.

14:31.820 --> 14:32.820
You're a nerd and sound get a life and Sims.

14:32.820 --> 14:34.820
I've been playing Sims three.

14:34.820 --> 14:35.820
Okay.

14:35.820 --> 14:41.780
And um, I played some tiny tower and of course these are all the same games I play, but I

14:41.780 --> 14:45.220
like to make and I played as Espa galuda.

14:45.220 --> 14:50.140
I can never say it as blue to two on my phone.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.180
Did you check out radiant silver gun on X-Box yet?

14:52.180 --> 14:53.380
That seems like something will be up your alley.

14:53.380 --> 14:59.500
I know that came out this week got like, but don't you want to see the super Uber HD version

14:59.500 --> 15:00.500
prettiness?

15:00.500 --> 15:01.500
I don't think that we got it yet.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.500
Now that I think about it.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.500
Yeah, that came.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.820
I just, I was thinking to you when I saw that on X-Box live the other day, I was like, oh,

15:05.820 --> 15:07.340
I want to play the crap out of that.

15:07.340 --> 15:11.500
Well, I was actually going to sit down and play, um, some, uh, symphony of the night

15:11.500 --> 15:15.300
today, but I've had a bad headache for most of the day.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.060
Damn Dracula causing those migraines.

15:17.060 --> 15:18.060
Yeah.

15:18.060 --> 15:19.380
Damn him.

15:19.380 --> 15:23.500
It is not by my hand that I was once again given my migraine.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.500
Loki.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.500
How was your gaming week?

15:25.500 --> 15:26.500
Um, it was all right.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.340
Didn't really play a whole lot of stuff.

15:28.340 --> 15:33.500
Um, mainly just three things, uh, earth defense force, insect Armageddon, played lots of that.

15:33.500 --> 15:42.540
Uh, I think I have my jet guy now almost level seven, um, and Grand Theft Auto, we went back

15:42.540 --> 15:47.260
to Lawson Dam again cause they got, they got tired of getting punked in, um, Battle of

15:47.260 --> 15:51.500
the Gay Tony, so now they're getting punked in Lawson Dam, so, you know, mixing it up

15:51.500 --> 15:53.700
a bit, I guess.

15:53.700 --> 16:01.140
Um, and then I played Zelda on, um, virtual console on the 3DS, so I've been playing that

16:01.140 --> 16:02.140
right now.

16:02.140 --> 16:10.980
I'm on the fifth dungeon, and, um, it's, it's fun, um, you know, the virtual console stuff's

16:10.980 --> 16:14.640
all right, but it does make you realize one thing, and I don't know if anyone's really

16:14.640 --> 16:21.940
covered it before, I'm sure they have, um, but, man, that D-pad, I mean Nintendo is known

16:21.940 --> 16:25.700
for pretty good D-pads, you know, especially with the NES and stuff like that, you know,

16:25.700 --> 16:34.140
great D-pad, or, no, I think pretty flawlessly, but that D-pad on that 3DS is terrible, and

16:34.140 --> 16:40.380
that, what do they call it now, the circle pad or whatever, not good either, so, it's

16:40.380 --> 16:44.260
just kind of like, okay, which terrible control method do I want to use?

16:44.260 --> 16:51.140
So I end up using the circle pad for most things, but it is not, not good at all, um,

16:51.140 --> 16:57.740
aside from that, though, the emulation's good, it's just that D-pad is terrible, but no D-pad

16:57.740 --> 16:58.740
look good?

16:58.740 --> 16:59.740
The one on the Vita.

16:59.740 --> 17:03.180
Yeah, there's a lot of neat looking things about the Vita, I gotta say, but I guess we'll

17:03.180 --> 17:06.340
get into that a little later, because there's lots and lots of news about handhelds, it's

17:06.340 --> 17:10.180
like, this is like handheld week, there's tons and tons of news about both, we'll get

17:10.180 --> 17:11.180
into that a little later.

17:11.180 --> 17:12.180
Is that it for your gaming week?

17:12.180 --> 17:13.180
Sounds like it?

17:13.180 --> 17:14.180
Yeah.

17:14.180 --> 17:18.340
My favorite game of the week, um, was mostly uneventful, I played a lot of the same stuff

17:18.340 --> 17:22.700
like WoW and so forth too, I had to really talk myself down from buying Magica on Steam

17:22.700 --> 17:26.300
today, although the game looks kind of fun, I might still buy it when I get home, it's

17:26.300 --> 17:33.360
like, only like 9 bucks for the Uber edition right now on Steam, or you can get like the

17:33.360 --> 17:39.220
buy 4 copies of the game for 7 dollars, it's like, it's some obscene sale going on on Steam

17:39.220 --> 17:44.420
right now, and man, I love and I hate Steam, you know what I mean?

17:44.420 --> 17:48.300
Like I love that I'm getting so many games super cheap, I hate that I keep spending money

17:48.300 --> 17:51.460
on games I'll play like once or twice and then it'll be all like, oh I gotta go back

17:51.460 --> 17:52.460
to WoW.

17:52.460 --> 17:57.060
As far as other games I've been playing, I've been playing more L.A. Noire on the consoles,

17:57.060 --> 18:00.960
did a couple other cases and so forth, and found that I'm really horrible at the action

18:00.960 --> 18:05.260
sequences and I'm so thankful that the developers decided to put in a way you could just skip

18:05.260 --> 18:09.920
the action sequences, cause like I just wasn't getting it, like, let me put it this way,

18:09.920 --> 18:14.220
at the end of one of the cases, you finally figure out who the suspect really is, and

18:14.220 --> 18:18.260
the suspect just bolts, suspect starts running, and the suspect ends up running around the

18:18.260 --> 18:24.180
corner and taking a hostage, and you have to shoot the suspect before he shoots the

18:24.180 --> 18:28.820
hostage, and like literally that scene started and I was like, shit, I forgot what button

18:28.820 --> 18:32.680
fires the gun, I'm like, is it R2 or was it L1?

18:32.680 --> 18:36.980
So I'm like hitting all the buttons, and I don't know, I screwed up one time, then I

18:36.980 --> 18:39.980
screwed up the other time because I thought disarming the suspect meant you shoot him

18:39.980 --> 18:41.980
in the hand.

18:41.980 --> 18:45.060
I thought you would shoot him in the hand, you shoot him in the leg, but no, I shot him

18:45.060 --> 18:49.860
in the hand that was holding the gun, and by some miracle of God, he shot the hostage

18:49.860 --> 18:52.300
anyway, so I don't know how that works.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.900
So finally it was just like, do you want to skip this action sequence, and I was like

18:54.900 --> 18:59.620
God yes, because the thing I like best about that game is going to look at the clues and

18:59.620 --> 19:04.180
going to investigate the suspects, or excuse me, interrogate the suspects, and put that

19:04.180 --> 19:05.180
all together.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.180
And investigating.

19:06.180 --> 19:11.420
It's kind of like, you know, like putting together the pieces of a logic puzzle or something,

19:11.420 --> 19:16.660
and it's amazing how exhilarating or how frustrating it can be when you hit the button, like I

19:16.660 --> 19:20.700
literally sit there, and it's like being on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and it's like,

19:20.700 --> 19:29.020
your final answer is truth, and then it goes, doo doo doo, fuck, I knew the bitch was lying.

19:29.020 --> 19:34.700
They just have a casual mode in there where you pull back a slingshot and launch a bird

19:34.700 --> 19:37.660
at the guy.

19:37.660 --> 19:41.040
But I gotta say, as far as Rockstar Game goes, I don't usually get into the Grand Theft Auto

19:41.040 --> 19:44.140
games and all that stuff, but I'm like, I'm really liking L.A. Noire.

19:44.140 --> 19:50.180
I like the detective thing, and I'm all into the stories and the 40s stuff, so yeah, I'm

19:50.180 --> 19:51.940
gonna play some more of that one.

19:51.940 --> 19:52.940
It's really cool.

19:52.940 --> 19:57.540
Some comments on Magica in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

19:57.540 --> 20:01.300
And Fanell, I hope I said that right, says, Magica is crazy fun.

20:01.300 --> 20:04.500
And Kaijuto says, Magica is crazy lag for me.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.860
Make sure they fix that lag before you buy.

20:06.860 --> 20:10.860
I wonder if that's for everybody or if it's like a system-related thing.

20:10.860 --> 20:11.860
Interesting.

20:11.860 --> 20:14.820
So yeah, I've been playing that.

20:14.820 --> 20:18.980
Now, there's another game I've been playing quite a bit of this week, and I didn't know

20:18.980 --> 20:22.780
if I wanted to talk about it on the show tonight, because I'm gonna kind of like open Pandora's

20:22.780 --> 20:25.580
Box here by saying what I've been playing.

20:25.580 --> 20:29.080
But I figure, what the hell, I'm not gonna be here the next two weeks anyway, so if any

20:29.080 --> 20:32.140
hate mail comes in, I wouldn't see it anyway.

20:32.140 --> 20:36.020
So if you've listened to this show for any length of time, I told you guys, I don't pirate

20:36.020 --> 20:37.020
games.

20:37.020 --> 20:41.540
I don't download a lot of games, I don't pirate games, except I have downloaded in the past,

20:41.540 --> 20:44.900
like during the PlayStation 1 era, I downloaded a lot of the Bamani games.

20:44.900 --> 20:46.660
Damn it, I was gonna bring you something.

20:46.660 --> 20:48.460
I was gonna bring you President Cat.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.580
I forgot both things.

20:50.580 --> 20:51.580
That's different, that's different.

20:51.580 --> 20:56.540
But I was gonna play the, or I used to back in the day, I would download the, cause I'm

20:56.540 --> 20:59.540
not paying 80 bucks to import like all these games.

20:59.540 --> 21:04.420
My mindset is, if you want my money, release the game in my territory, and I'll buy it.

21:04.420 --> 21:08.940
So that being said, I've played quite a bit of Xenoblade Chronicles this week, and I'll

21:08.940 --> 21:10.940
leave it at that.

21:10.940 --> 21:15.860
I don't wanna talk a little bit about Xenoblade Chronicles, because it's interesting.

21:15.860 --> 21:17.420
The game is very interesting.

21:17.420 --> 21:19.820
First off, is the game a good game?

21:19.820 --> 21:20.820
Yes.

21:20.820 --> 21:23.420
Is it something the Wii needs on its system?

21:23.420 --> 21:24.860
I think so.

21:24.860 --> 21:27.940
But here's the honest reaction I had playing Xenoblade Chronicles.

21:27.940 --> 21:30.460
The first thing out of my mouth, cause Salacious Pop, you know, I was sitting down playing

21:30.460 --> 21:33.660
it for a couple hours, and Salacious Pop goes, well how was it?

21:33.660 --> 21:35.540
And I said, you know what?

21:35.540 --> 21:41.060
It feels like a really, really awesome PlayStation 2 game.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.300
And that's kinda how I felt about it.

21:43.300 --> 21:49.220
Is that the graphics, really not up to par with what you see on the 360 and the PlayStation

21:49.220 --> 21:50.220
3.

21:50.220 --> 21:51.220
It's understandable.

21:51.220 --> 21:52.220
It's the Wii.

21:52.220 --> 21:55.260
The game itself feels a lot like, I don't know, it's kinda like Final Fantasy XII, with

21:55.260 --> 22:01.380
MMO elements, and a pretty neat battle system reminiscent of the other, you know, Xeno games.

22:01.380 --> 22:04.100
So there's a lot to do in the game.

22:04.100 --> 22:05.240
There's a lot of quests.

22:05.240 --> 22:09.980
There's a lot of things you can do in the game, and the world is vast, and it's really

22:09.980 --> 22:10.980
something else.

22:10.980 --> 22:16.460
And if you're an RPG fan, you really have a right to be mad that they're not putting

22:16.460 --> 22:17.700
the game out here.

22:17.700 --> 22:21.700
And quite frankly, if they're not gonna put it out here, you should do what I did.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.060
Don't miss out on a great game.

22:23.060 --> 22:26.700
Sorry, I know I might get hate mail for encouraging that, but you know what?

22:26.700 --> 22:32.460
I will happily buy this game when they release it in this country.

22:32.460 --> 22:33.660
There you go.

22:33.660 --> 22:39.020
Here's what I think might happen.

22:39.020 --> 22:45.060
And this is maybe fan wank speculation, but if my honest reaction to the game was, you

22:45.060 --> 22:50.020
know, this game needs to have, like, better graphics to really be competitive.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.900
Maybe they're holding back and releasing it on the Wii U.

22:52.900 --> 22:57.300
Because I could see this game really easily being adapted for the Wii U.

22:57.300 --> 23:01.740
There's a lot, like the menu system, there's a lot to it, there's a lot of sub screens.

23:01.740 --> 23:06.740
You could use that second device, or the little controller, very easily to do a lot of that,

23:06.740 --> 23:08.960
and then you could have the really nice souped-up graphics.

23:08.960 --> 23:13.500
And to be honest, if Nintendo, you know, maybe I'm giving them too much credit here, but

23:13.500 --> 23:16.060
it would be a kick-ass launch title.

23:16.060 --> 23:18.600
Especially in the, like, it would be a kick-ass launch title.

23:18.600 --> 23:23.100
You don't usually see a lot of very vast RPGs as launch titles.

23:23.100 --> 23:26.180
What did the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 have?

23:26.180 --> 23:30.740
I think Enchanted Arms was like the only remote RPG available for like six months.

23:30.740 --> 23:31.740
Oblivion?

23:31.740 --> 23:32.740
Oh yeah.

23:32.740 --> 23:37.420
But I'm thinking Japanese RPG, I'm not thinking, there's a big difference in my mind between

23:37.420 --> 23:42.020
a game like Final Fantasy, Enchanted Arms, Xenoblade, and Oblivion.

23:42.020 --> 23:44.580
Oblivion's its own thing.

23:44.580 --> 23:48.420
But yeah, you're right, you're right, Oblivion is a pretty kick-ass RPG launch title.

23:48.420 --> 23:49.420
I should have thought of that.

23:49.420 --> 23:50.420
No, here's what they're gonna do.

23:50.420 --> 23:51.420
Come on.

23:51.420 --> 23:54.620
I mean, yeah, this is Nintendo, and yeah, I can see them doing that, because you know

23:54.620 --> 23:55.620
what?

23:55.620 --> 23:58.420
They have nothing to bring to the table right now for the Wii U.

23:58.420 --> 24:04.300
They've got nothing, so they gotta, they can't hold back Zelda Skyward Sword any longer,

24:04.300 --> 24:07.580
because people will just be really pissed off then.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.140
But here's what they're gonna do.

24:09.140 --> 24:11.980
All they're gonna do is they're gonna fucking upscale that shit.

24:11.980 --> 24:13.740
They're not gonna redo the graphics.

24:13.740 --> 24:18.380
They're gonna upscale the polygons, and you're gonna have low-res textures, you know, like

24:18.380 --> 24:23.040
you've seen with the Metal Gear Solid HD collection.

24:23.040 --> 24:24.940
There's different ways that they do HD.

24:24.940 --> 24:30.060
Some of them, they'll actually go to the Microsoft, you know, Halo route or whatever, and you'll

24:30.060 --> 24:35.620
see where it's redone in a whole new engine, but it's the same, you know, levels and that

24:35.620 --> 24:38.100
kind of stuff, and everything's kind of redone in a new engine.

24:38.100 --> 24:43.420
Or they go the route where, oh, we're just gonna up-res all the polygons, and the textures,

24:43.420 --> 24:46.460
well they're just gonna look kind of fuzzy and smoothed out, but hey, you know what,

24:46.460 --> 24:50.740
at least it's not all jaggy like it was, you know, in the older systems.

24:50.740 --> 24:54.700
That's all they're gonna fucking do, and they're gonna maybe add some support for the Wii U

24:54.700 --> 24:57.260
tablet thing, but you know what?

24:57.260 --> 24:59.920
People will be like, oh my god, that's amazing, that's great!

24:59.920 --> 25:00.920
But that's what they're doing.

25:00.920 --> 25:05.820
They're holding out so that they go, lookit, we understand what the hardcore fan wants,

25:05.820 --> 25:10.900
and we brought it to you with the Wii U, and you're supposed to go, oh my god, Nintendo,

25:10.900 --> 25:11.900
my savior!

25:11.900 --> 25:13.860
I'm gonna go buy your system now!

25:13.860 --> 25:17.120
But you need to see through this shit, and you say, fuck them, they're just trying to

25:17.120 --> 25:20.540
hold this little carrot in front of my nose, so I buy another fucking system that they

25:20.540 --> 25:25.180
end up catering to the goddamn masses for, and make all these casual games, and completely

25:25.180 --> 25:29.800
forget about the hardcore user that actually buys product for their damn system.

25:29.800 --> 25:34.020
Here's the thing though, like, I agree and I don't, because the thing is, at the end

25:34.020 --> 25:40.140
of the day, it's not just about the graphics, and the game itself is pretty freaking awesome,

25:40.140 --> 25:44.740
especially, like if you like JRPGs at all, or you like these kind of like, you know,

25:44.740 --> 25:50.500
very open world, do the side quests and battles in real time without going into cutscenes

25:50.500 --> 25:55.020
for battle and all this, you know, the presentation of the game is great, and the game itself,

25:55.020 --> 25:57.500
story and everything, is pretty awesome.

25:57.500 --> 26:02.380
I don't think they need to do, I mean, the graphics do look dated, but even upresing

26:02.380 --> 26:06.540
or whatever little tweaks they can make to it, that bring it a bump up, I think it's

26:06.540 --> 26:07.540
okay.

26:07.540 --> 26:10.340
Because at the end of the day, the game itself speaks for itself.

26:10.340 --> 26:13.340
System's only as good as the games that are on it, buh buh buh buh buh, right?

26:13.340 --> 26:14.340
So-

26:14.340 --> 26:16.780
Well then if that's the way they want to go, they want to, you know, bring it out over

26:16.780 --> 26:19.440
here, they need to bring it out on the Wii, like it is now, because it's done.

26:19.440 --> 26:23.660
It can be put out now, and then they can do a special edition later on that has better

26:23.660 --> 26:28.400
graphics or an HD version, and that'd come out like a year later.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.400
What's the problem with that?

26:29.400 --> 26:32.020
You get to sell it twice, and people may buy it twice.

26:32.020 --> 26:38.540
The problem is, and I'm just being real with y'all here, the more Nintendo, I feel like

26:38.540 --> 26:43.020
they're ignoring the type of game that I want to play, the more it makes me want to turn

26:43.020 --> 26:44.740
to the dark side to do it.

26:44.740 --> 26:50.860
And how easy was it to do when major gaming websites are posting, here's how to play Xenoblade

26:50.860 --> 26:54.660
in the US, like Nintendo is just being fucking deaf.

26:54.660 --> 27:00.260
And that's fine if their ultimate grand scheme plan thing is to release it on the Wii U,

27:00.260 --> 27:02.640
but I think they should have announced that by now.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.580
And like, I would have waited to play this game.

27:04.580 --> 27:07.660
If they'd announced it on the Wii U, I would have said, cool, it'll give me a launch game

27:07.660 --> 27:11.300
that sounds like it'll be pretty kick-ass based on everything I've read online.

27:11.300 --> 27:13.940
But seeing as I'm getting to this point where I'm like, you know what, this game is never

27:13.940 --> 27:20.780
going to come out, and I really want to play it, so gosh, there's this ABC how to run these

27:20.780 --> 27:24.540
games on my Wii right in front of my face, I'm doing it.

27:24.540 --> 27:27.980
I want to play this game.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.420
So be mad if you want, but I'm just being real.

27:31.420 --> 27:33.360
I'm not the only one out there.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.820
Or major gaming websites will not be publishing how to get away with it.

27:36.820 --> 27:41.700
To be honest, it was just how to play the import copy of the game.

27:41.700 --> 27:50.940
Well, yeah, no, and that's fine, and I understand that, but let's be real.

27:50.940 --> 27:53.100
Let's be real.

27:53.100 --> 27:58.020
You surely, you know, there's the thought of what you're really telling people, come

27:58.020 --> 28:01.980
on, don't be, don't be ignorant, and I say that to everybody.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.280
So it is what it is.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.320
It's that, you know.

28:06.320 --> 28:10.300
So will I buy the game if it comes out on Wii U?

28:10.300 --> 28:11.300
Probably.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.300
But, I don't know.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.780
It depends if we want to buy it on the Wii U.

28:15.780 --> 28:20.340
Yeah, right now the question is, will I buy a Wii U, and I don't know.

28:20.340 --> 28:22.660
Well, here's the thing with the Wii U.

28:22.660 --> 28:25.580
I mean, look at some of the games that they're talking about coming out of the system.

28:25.580 --> 28:28.380
There's like Batman Arkham City.

28:28.380 --> 28:29.820
Why?

28:29.820 --> 28:34.260
You're gonna release a game that's been out for a year now, you know, on that system?

28:34.260 --> 28:35.780
I mean, who cares?

28:35.780 --> 28:39.100
I just don't even see a point.

28:39.100 --> 28:40.780
Release Skyward Sword on there then.

28:40.780 --> 28:44.620
I mean, because no one's gonna fucking care because it's been out for a year.

28:44.620 --> 28:47.140
I just, I don't know.

28:47.140 --> 28:52.020
Right now they just don't have much to bring to the table for that, and I, I'd be surprised

28:52.020 --> 28:53.500
if that system comes out next year.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.300
All right, well we'll see.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.540
All right, well that's it.

28:57.540 --> 28:59.020
That's all I'm gonna say for my gaming week.

28:59.020 --> 29:03.860
But yeah, Xenoblade Chronicles is a great game, and it's really too bad that Nintendo

29:03.860 --> 29:04.860
won't release it here.

29:04.860 --> 29:05.860
What else can I say?

29:05.860 --> 29:11.300
So, all right, let's move on and get some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's

29:11.300 --> 29:12.300
stories.

29:12.300 --> 29:14.260
I will not be here for the next two weeks.

29:14.260 --> 29:15.500
Yeah, two weeks.

29:15.500 --> 29:21.620
I'm actually, after last week's show I realized, oh crap, I've got the concert next week and

29:21.620 --> 29:25.380
then I actually have a scheduled trip to LA the week after that, and it's the one I do

29:25.380 --> 29:26.380
every year.

29:26.380 --> 29:28.100
So, yep, I'm taking a little break.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.100
Sorry guys.

29:29.100 --> 29:35.740
But I believe the one and only Tiara is gonna be here covering, at least next week, if not

29:35.740 --> 29:36.740
both weeks.

29:36.740 --> 29:37.740
I don't know yet.

29:37.740 --> 29:38.740
Just next week.

29:38.740 --> 29:39.740
Just next week.

29:39.740 --> 29:44.380
So, there will be some type of live shows, so tune in as always, and I'll miss you guys.

29:44.380 --> 29:49.820
But at the same time, damn, we need vacations once in a while, give me a break.

29:49.820 --> 29:50.940
Let's get into some gaming news.

29:50.940 --> 29:51.940
Oh yeah.

29:51.940 --> 29:52.940
Facebook.

29:52.940 --> 29:53.940
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

29:53.940 --> 29:55.260
Add us on Facebook please.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.260
And Twitter.

29:56.260 --> 30:00.460
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Now we can get into some gaming news.

30:00.460 --> 30:01.940
We'll start it off with Loki.

30:01.940 --> 30:05.700
I don't take vacations at all.

30:05.700 --> 30:12.380
So Nintendo announced a lot of stuff at their pre-Toku game show press event.

30:12.380 --> 30:15.820
Some of the stuff they announced, hey, you know those big games that you're waiting for

30:15.820 --> 30:17.900
and ones that you may have purchased a system for?

30:17.900 --> 30:20.660
Yeah, they're not coming this year.

30:20.660 --> 30:26.980
Kid Icarus Uprising has been delayed to 2012, and that's for all regions.

30:26.980 --> 30:31.500
And of course, you know, it's critically acclaimed, and yeah.

30:31.500 --> 30:32.500
Looks amazing.

30:32.500 --> 30:36.380
You know, they had new video footage for it, but yeah, not coming out this year.

30:36.380 --> 30:37.940
Too bad.

30:37.940 --> 30:45.180
Of course, there's gonna be a new system update coming for the 3DS in November, and this is

30:45.180 --> 30:49.860
gonna add 3D video capture as well.

30:49.860 --> 30:55.260
And definitely kind of a cool thing, you know, because I know the 3D photos are pretty cool.

30:55.260 --> 30:57.640
Yeah, actually that sounds all sorts of awesome.

30:57.640 --> 31:02.340
Like I'm really all about the 3D video capture, but the only problem is the resolution on

31:02.340 --> 31:04.020
those cameras is kind of shit.

31:04.020 --> 31:05.740
That's terrible.

31:05.740 --> 31:07.660
So that's kind of unfortunate.

31:07.660 --> 31:11.860
Like if those cameras were just a slight better quality, it would be awesome, but you know

31:11.860 --> 31:18.320
that next year when there's the 3DS Lite or the 3DS XL or whatever crap they come up with,

31:18.320 --> 31:19.660
there's gonna be better cameras in it.

31:19.660 --> 31:23.700
I'm sure that will help with the 3D, because let's be real, like not a lot of people have

31:23.700 --> 31:27.500
3D cameras or 3D video cameras right now, so Nintendo could kind of get a jump on that,

31:27.500 --> 31:30.860
you know, whole thing, the 3D craze by implementing that.

31:30.860 --> 31:34.280
I'm really surprised it didn't have video at launch.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.180
Not surprised at all that it's being patched in.

31:36.180 --> 31:38.180
You're surprised?

31:38.180 --> 31:42.620
The device didn't have all the features that they, you know, they talked about.

31:42.620 --> 31:44.620
Oh yeah, eShop, you want to buy stuff?

31:44.620 --> 31:46.380
Ehh, that's not coming for a few months.

31:46.380 --> 31:47.380
Who's sharing?

31:47.380 --> 31:48.940
Oh hey, you want to browse the internet?

31:48.940 --> 31:52.820
Yeah, we didn't put the web browser in there, it wasn't quite done yet.

31:52.820 --> 31:57.740
Ahh, Rush, no, we didn't rush the system, what are you talking about?

31:57.740 --> 32:00.820
This was always planned like that.

32:00.820 --> 32:01.820
Yeah.

32:01.820 --> 32:09.100
So, November, because you know, they don't like the Rush things, they're taking their

32:09.100 --> 32:10.100
time.

32:10.100 --> 32:16.740
Of course, one of the things that came out was this god-awful ugly circle pad attachment

32:16.740 --> 32:23.060
for Monster Hunter Tri-G, and of course, it's been announced that several titles will actually

32:23.060 --> 32:30.660
support it, including Resident Evil Revelations, Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D, Ace Combat

32:30.660 --> 32:37.900
3D, Dynasty Warriors Versus, and Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance.

32:37.900 --> 32:42.180
And of course, this device is going to require an additional AAA battery to use because it's

32:42.180 --> 32:49.340
got to communicate with the 3DS via the infrared port on the back, and it will also add a couple

32:49.340 --> 32:53.540
extra shoulder buttons, and of course the circle pad.

32:53.540 --> 32:58.620
Funny thing about the circle pad is, it's not needed for Monster Hunter.

32:58.620 --> 33:03.300
In fact, all the demo kiosks at Tokyo Game Show didn't have it.

33:03.300 --> 33:04.740
Interesting.

33:04.740 --> 33:09.320
This thing is so interesting because, well A, the whole fact that it requires a separate

33:09.320 --> 33:13.420
battery to run, like you could just hear the facepalming going on across Twitter and the

33:13.420 --> 33:17.140
blogs and so forth when that was announced, so I'll just kind of let that speak for itself

33:17.140 --> 33:20.860
and the whole, yeah, yeah, sure, they plan to do this the whole time, I'm really sure,

33:20.860 --> 33:24.060
because they thought about adding that port on the back that could interface with this

33:24.060 --> 33:26.700
and power it, but oops.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.780
Of course, then again, you don't want anything else sucking the power out of the 3DS because

33:29.780 --> 33:33.460
it's not like it holds a lot to begin with, right?

33:33.460 --> 33:38.980
But it really is sounding more and more like this is the 3DS's version of MotionPlus, only

33:38.980 --> 33:41.860
it's happening a lot faster.

33:41.860 --> 33:45.180
And I really wonder how long it's gonna be before this thing is mandatory.

33:45.180 --> 33:51.180
And you know on the remake next year, there's gonna be better cameras and the second analog

33:51.180 --> 33:52.180
pad.

33:52.180 --> 33:57.420
Look at that, second analog pad can go right there, nice little home for it right on the

33:57.420 --> 33:58.420
device.

33:58.420 --> 34:01.780
No, because the way it looks right now is just like a Wii U controller.

34:01.780 --> 34:09.140
Yeah, but see, I believe that the buttons are, well actually, the buttons are above,

34:09.140 --> 34:12.700
are below the thing, well fine, they'll move the buttons down and then they'll put the

34:12.700 --> 34:14.700
circle pad there.

34:14.700 --> 34:22.580
Hey, but they got you the BIOS system because they dropped the price, right?

34:22.580 --> 34:23.900
Haha, suckers!

34:23.900 --> 34:26.900
And then you'll buy it again!

34:26.900 --> 34:29.980
That's what Nintendo likes to do, sell you hardware over and over and over again.

34:29.980 --> 34:32.540
Remember Game Boy?

34:32.540 --> 34:38.540
Coinora Chatroom at chat.orangelandrader.com, Randy says, that 3DS attachment makes the

34:38.540 --> 34:41.380
thing look like a Game Gear.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.380
A little bit.

34:42.380 --> 34:46.140
I think the battery life might be a little better on a Game Gear though, not sure.

34:46.140 --> 34:50.260
And then of course, you know, the best way to target your female audience is to put it

34:50.260 --> 34:51.700
out in pink.

34:51.700 --> 34:57.140
So they have a 3DS coming out in pink in October.

34:57.140 --> 35:03.100
Yeah, uh, cool.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.660
Not necessarily in the US.

35:04.660 --> 35:06.380
Not in the US, in Japan only.

35:06.380 --> 35:07.660
Are people really that shallow?

35:07.660 --> 35:12.260
I mean, I understand people like pink things, but it's like, oh, I'm not buying that system.

35:12.260 --> 35:13.260
Oh, it's in pink!

35:13.260 --> 35:14.260
Oh, okay.

35:14.260 --> 35:16.020
Yes, people are that shallow.

35:16.020 --> 35:19.300
Just accept it and move on.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.260
I shake my head at you guys.

35:21.260 --> 35:24.100
See, this is how they get away with all that shit.

35:24.100 --> 35:25.900
Put out a pink box for a game, huh?

35:25.900 --> 35:29.380
Whenever blue systems come out, Megalotov's right there ready to buy one.

35:29.380 --> 35:31.140
So I don't know what to tell you.

35:31.140 --> 35:32.140
It's on, Dan.

35:32.140 --> 35:34.140
What do you want to say?

35:34.140 --> 35:35.140
Whoops.

35:35.140 --> 35:36.140
Except it's muted.

35:36.140 --> 35:37.140
Sorry about that.

35:37.140 --> 35:38.140
Go ahead.

35:38.140 --> 35:39.580
Pink systems, giant sellers at Christmas time.

35:39.580 --> 35:40.580
Are they really?

35:40.580 --> 35:41.580
Oh yeah.

35:41.580 --> 35:45.060
You can't get the like the pink DS light.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.540
You couldn't bag bar or steal one of those at Christmas time.

35:47.540 --> 35:50.100
And the other time of the year, nobody fucking wanted them.

35:50.100 --> 35:51.100
Isn't it really?

35:51.100 --> 35:54.380
Well, remember when I got my, um, uh, GBA?

35:54.380 --> 35:56.740
Oh, dear God, no.

35:56.740 --> 35:57.740
My pink GBA.

35:57.740 --> 35:58.740
What about it?

35:58.740 --> 36:00.700
And no one else could find them?

36:00.700 --> 36:01.700
No.

36:01.700 --> 36:04.700
But you know, it's not really just...

36:04.700 --> 36:06.680
GBA, that was a long time ago.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.060
It's not pink and hard to find.

36:08.060 --> 36:09.980
It's not really just about the colors though, right?

36:09.980 --> 36:12.900
Like, I don't know how many of you guys were watching the press conferences that was going

36:12.900 --> 36:18.900
on, but they followed up this conversation on pink 3DSs with the girl tailored games,

36:18.900 --> 36:21.280
which were, they looked really creepster to me.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.340
Like I didn't get it, but of course, you know, it's a different culture, whatever.

36:24.340 --> 36:26.900
Some comedian based game, I think was one of them.

36:26.900 --> 36:30.180
They have a lot of girl based games already.

36:30.180 --> 36:34.860
I mean, Ubisoft puts out a ton of girl games.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.740
I mean, there is tons of DS games.

36:37.740 --> 36:42.060
I want to preface by saying like tween girl games.

36:42.060 --> 36:47.540
Like I don't want to infer, cause dark soccer might kick my butt, that girls like play different

36:47.540 --> 36:48.540
games.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.740
And like, you know, all girls hate Metroid and things like that.

36:51.740 --> 36:57.080
But like, you know, the ones that are aimed at like the little girls, I'm going to punch

36:57.080 --> 37:02.500
you with this microphone.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.780
Although let's be real.

37:03.780 --> 37:06.260
She did say she played a lot of Sims 3 this week.

37:06.260 --> 37:08.180
I'm just kidding.

37:08.180 --> 37:10.580
She's stuck on that Facebook Sims game.

37:10.580 --> 37:12.340
A lot of people actually didn't touch it.

37:12.340 --> 37:13.900
What a piece of crap.

37:13.900 --> 37:14.900
Bullshit.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.660
A lot of people are stuck on that Facebook game.

37:17.660 --> 37:20.020
You lie like a rug.

37:20.020 --> 37:23.220
I didn't play it at all yesterday.

37:23.220 --> 37:24.540
So many of my Sims hated me.

37:24.540 --> 37:29.900
But the DS, they did really try to market the DS at girls for a while.

37:29.900 --> 37:35.520
Like didn't they have like Beyonce and Carrie Underwood doing commercials and Beyonce does

37:35.520 --> 37:37.940
it then I've got to do that.

37:37.940 --> 37:41.660
Girls and women were a huge marketing push with the Wii too.

37:41.660 --> 37:46.980
Nintendo was just all about, you know, 40% of the consumers out there are 50% or 60%

37:46.980 --> 37:47.980
or whatever are women.

37:47.980 --> 37:49.100
And we're not marketing to them.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.260
You've got to sell to women.

37:50.260 --> 37:51.260
Sell, sell, sell.

37:51.260 --> 37:54.900
Recommend games for girls, girls, girls, girls, sell, sell, sell.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.460
I'm like, you fucking people.

37:56.460 --> 37:59.260
Have you seen the customers that come into my store?

37:59.260 --> 38:01.260
99% male.

38:01.260 --> 38:05.580
If there's a girl in my store, they stay out until the girl leaves.

38:05.580 --> 38:08.460
No, that's not true.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.180
Well, it's often true.

38:10.180 --> 38:12.060
It's because I don't know what to do around a woman.

38:12.060 --> 38:16.060
If there's a girl in the store selling on the other hand, oh shit, unless she's the

38:16.060 --> 38:20.260
world's worst salesperson, she could sell whatever it's because that's the only way

38:20.260 --> 38:22.020
they'll ever see a woman in real life.

38:22.020 --> 38:23.980
That's what I was saying.

38:23.980 --> 38:29.780
But now they can see women in 3D on the 3DS in 3D, 3D boobies.

38:29.780 --> 38:32.500
It's probably the first time they ever see 3D boobies.

38:32.500 --> 38:36.500
All right, no, no, no, I kid.

38:36.500 --> 38:39.700
So I don't know how many of you guys again watched Nintendo's conference.

38:39.700 --> 38:43.820
Obviously there was a lot of focus on the monster hunter games that's coming out games

38:43.820 --> 38:48.340
because there's tri-G and then there's four that they announced is going to be a Nintendo

38:48.340 --> 38:49.980
3DS thing as well.

38:49.980 --> 38:53.800
And then I got to say, I was totally thinking of Dark Sakura because after the press conference,

38:53.800 --> 38:58.600
there was like 15 minutes of monster hunter commercials that featured Gachamon.

38:58.600 --> 39:03.280
Like for 15 minutes, like all these little Gachamon ads for monster hunter games that

39:03.280 --> 39:04.280
made me laugh.

39:04.280 --> 39:05.860
Okay, I need this if there's Gachamon involved.

39:05.860 --> 39:10.940
I watched them all thinking that that's when they were finally going to show that 3DS peripheral.

39:10.940 --> 39:16.260
What was very interesting, that add on completely absent from Nintendo's press conference that

39:16.260 --> 39:18.380
they did for not Tokyo game show.

39:18.380 --> 39:19.780
I don't care about any of that.

39:19.780 --> 39:21.660
You've lost me at Gachamon.

39:21.660 --> 39:22.980
I'm totally being honest.

39:22.980 --> 39:27.460
I should have like called you and it was on YouTube.

39:27.460 --> 39:28.460
You might find them on YouTube.

39:28.460 --> 39:29.460
You might.

39:29.460 --> 39:31.460
They were all funny.

39:31.460 --> 39:37.580
Now, uh, Kevin 6L8 in our chat room, maybe that's Kevin68 in our chat room says, uh,

39:37.580 --> 39:43.500
in my store about a good third of the people buying our team to young adult girls buying

39:43.500 --> 39:44.500
what buying?

39:44.500 --> 39:48.940
I'm assuming like DS and related systems or maybe we are, of course.

39:48.940 --> 39:49.940
Why not expo?

39:49.940 --> 39:52.300
Yeah, that's, that's, that's the same thing.

39:52.300 --> 39:53.460
I was watching our soccer.

39:53.460 --> 39:56.660
She's, she brought it up.

39:56.660 --> 39:57.660
Just a preface.

39:57.660 --> 40:02.080
I worked at a game crazy and I also worked at a store, you know, a few years ago back

40:02.080 --> 40:04.420
before girls started playing games.

40:04.420 --> 40:06.800
That's the scariest looking kate I've ever seen.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.620
She didn't even pay attention.

40:08.620 --> 40:11.660
Nobody cares.

40:11.660 --> 40:16.020
It's a 70 show about a bird ninja team.

40:16.020 --> 40:17.740
The science ninja team.

40:17.740 --> 40:18.740
All right.

40:18.740 --> 40:23.220
Uh, let's talk about the Vita a little bit cause there's a lot of news on the PlayStation

40:23.220 --> 40:24.660
Vita as well.

40:24.660 --> 40:30.940
Um, first off at their conference, they had this slide talking about 100 titles already

40:30.940 --> 40:32.660
announced for the Vita.

40:32.660 --> 40:39.100
Uh, things like a Ninja guidance, Sigma, ultimate moral, Marvel vs Capcom three, Katamari, DJ

40:39.100 --> 40:45.780
max technica, um, the sound shapes game, super stardust, Delta wipeout Ridge racer, of course

40:45.780 --> 40:46.780
always has to be there.

40:46.780 --> 40:52.540
Zone of Enders, HD, metal gear, solid HD, uh, Gundam games, super robot, Tyson games,

40:52.540 --> 40:54.700
tales of innocence, et cetera, et cetera.

40:54.700 --> 41:00.140
So lots, I mean, it's very interesting watching the Sony conference because they are doing

41:00.140 --> 41:03.400
everything they can to not fuck this up.

41:03.400 --> 41:08.180
They and they are, they are trying to just punch Nintendo in the jugular.

41:08.180 --> 41:12.440
And I'll tell you what, the delay of the Vita in the U S I'm telling you is so that the

41:12.440 --> 41:14.240
lineup looks as strong here.

41:14.240 --> 41:17.220
They are doing what everybody says Nintendo should have done.

41:17.220 --> 41:20.940
And by, I mean, and everybody's saying Nintendo should not have launched a 3ds until Christmas.

41:20.940 --> 41:24.220
And so what the Vita is doing is the Vita is waiting and it's building up an arsenal

41:24.220 --> 41:25.220
of games.

41:25.220 --> 41:28.460
So now when that thing launches here, it's going to come out with a bang.

41:28.460 --> 41:30.260
It's it's really interesting.

41:30.260 --> 41:35.700
It is actually, I mean, I wasn't too interested in, because before, you know, granted before

41:35.700 --> 41:39.780
during E3, all they were showing was like, here's uncharted and then here's a bunch of

41:39.780 --> 41:41.420
other crappy games that you don't give a shit about.

41:41.420 --> 41:45.580
Oh, and wipe out for the, you know, the Vita I was like, eh, I don't really care for any

41:45.580 --> 41:46.580
of that crap.

41:46.580 --> 41:50.820
But now they're showing all the third party games for the Vita and it's looking nice,

41:50.820 --> 41:51.820
right?

41:51.820 --> 41:56.980
Uh, by the way, the Vita does come out December 17th, the date has been announced in Japan.

41:56.980 --> 42:00.620
So it's very, they are cutting it really close there with the end of the year.

42:00.620 --> 42:05.260
And uh, you know, that would be way too late here in America to make the holiday season.

42:05.260 --> 42:08.780
I still think it would sell tons anyway, but I, I think Sony's doing the right thing by

42:08.780 --> 42:12.640
waiting till next year because they're just going to dump a crap ton of games whenever

42:12.640 --> 42:13.640
it launches here.

42:13.640 --> 42:17.700
They did not announce the date here, although something to think about, it was reiterated

42:17.700 --> 42:22.940
this week in on Twitter, in a Twitter conversation with, um, Sony computer entertainment president

42:22.940 --> 42:28.100
of worldwide studios, Suhei Yoshida has reiterated the Vita is region free.

42:28.100 --> 42:31.620
So if you want to import one of those fuckers on December 17th, you're good to go.

42:31.620 --> 42:36.700
I'm getting the shakes already.

42:36.700 --> 42:41.060
Giving Nintendo an unopposed holiday season is not smart.

42:41.060 --> 42:46.300
They need to at least, I mean, I'm sure that before the holiday season really kicks in

42:46.300 --> 42:48.500
that we'll at least know a date.

42:48.500 --> 42:54.620
Uh, I, I do agree and they're not, but they're not going opposed in Japan, which is going

42:54.620 --> 42:57.220
to be the biggest battleground I think of sorts.

42:57.220 --> 42:58.220
I don't know.

42:58.220 --> 43:03.060
I, I'm not too worried about the 3ds in, in the U S because I think, you know, the games

43:03.060 --> 43:08.380
that they have coming out, they have, was it a super Mario 3d land and November and

43:08.380 --> 43:09.620
that's really it.

43:09.620 --> 43:15.620
And other than that, it's a Mario karts coming out in December, but later on and I don't

43:15.620 --> 43:16.620
know.

43:16.620 --> 43:20.940
So it's Mario definitely is a draw, but is it a system seller?

43:20.940 --> 43:22.940
They're doing a smash brothers for that thing.

43:22.940 --> 43:25.800
Yeah, yeah, they're doing a smash brothers for that thing.

43:25.800 --> 43:30.460
And people are at some point in time, they have how many fucking people bought the Wii

43:30.460 --> 43:32.260
because they put smash brothers on it.

43:32.260 --> 43:33.260
I understand that.

43:33.260 --> 43:38.020
And that's fine if they buy Nintendo needs to do is find that one fucking title.

43:38.020 --> 43:40.180
That's what they've done with every system.

43:40.180 --> 43:41.180
Every system.

43:41.180 --> 43:43.380
People are just like, well, I don't know.

43:43.380 --> 43:48.540
And then it comes out with that one title, which on the original DS was like Ninten dogs

43:48.540 --> 43:49.540
or something.

43:49.540 --> 43:52.220
And everybody goes, I got to have one of these fucking things.

43:52.220 --> 43:53.620
So what fucking brain age?

43:53.620 --> 43:54.620
Yeah, exactly.

43:54.620 --> 43:59.220
What happens if at Christmas that one title comes out and Sony's just left holding their

43:59.220 --> 44:00.340
sack?

44:00.340 --> 44:01.540
They're not going to, I'm sorry.

44:01.540 --> 44:05.940
It's it's not going to, first off smash brothers at E3, which they shouldn't have even really

44:05.940 --> 44:06.940
announced at E3.

44:06.940 --> 44:09.700
They're like, yeah, Hey, I'm thinking about working on a smash brothers game.

44:09.700 --> 44:10.700
Is it in development?

44:10.700 --> 44:11.700
No.

44:11.700 --> 44:13.580
Is it coming out anytime soon?

44:13.580 --> 44:14.580
No.

44:14.580 --> 44:15.580
But, but we're thinking about it.

44:15.580 --> 44:16.580
Yeah.

44:16.580 --> 44:17.580
Just like we're thinking about doing a Pikmin game.

44:17.580 --> 44:20.940
Where the fuck is your new Pikmin game that you promised us two years ago for the week?

44:20.940 --> 44:22.700
Oh, that's never coming out.

44:22.700 --> 44:24.940
So smash brothers for the three DS.

44:24.940 --> 44:25.940
Yeah.

44:25.940 --> 44:29.540
They promised you net two and you know, they promised that games coming out now, but two

44:29.540 --> 44:33.220
years from now when it's like, um, Hey, where's the smash brothers game?

44:33.220 --> 44:34.220
You promise us?

44:34.220 --> 44:35.220
Yeah.

44:35.220 --> 44:37.060
We're going to put it on the next three DS system that we're going to put out.

44:37.060 --> 44:39.060
So, uh, sorry.

44:39.060 --> 44:44.340
Three DS, I still think the internet as a whole, were you trying to say something Jamie?

44:44.340 --> 44:45.340
Sorry.

44:45.340 --> 44:46.340
Not anymore.

44:46.340 --> 44:47.340
Okay.

44:47.340 --> 44:51.540
I still think the internet as a whole is being a little hard on Nintendo because it's hard

44:51.540 --> 44:56.620
on, he said hard on, but no, for real, because, and believe me, I have my issues with Nintendo

44:56.620 --> 45:00.280
as well, but I think the three DS is going to sell bucket loads this Christmas.

45:00.280 --> 45:05.100
I think a lot of people are seriously underestimating the power of that Mario cart and the Mario

45:05.100 --> 45:06.340
land three D games.

45:06.340 --> 45:10.740
I think that's going to sell a lot of systems this holiday, especially with there not being

45:10.740 --> 45:11.740
a Vita.

45:11.740 --> 45:12.740
Don't get me wrong.

45:12.740 --> 45:16.340
The Vita is going to be an impressive thing and going to have a huge launch next year

45:16.340 --> 45:20.900
that doesn't do anything for this Christmas here in the U S I just think those like Mario

45:20.900 --> 45:24.460
cart, especially is huge.

45:24.460 --> 45:26.220
I really think so.

45:26.220 --> 45:29.660
I just think they need to bring up motion sickness pills with it.

45:29.660 --> 45:33.740
I've gone through 10 holiday seasons and game retail.

45:33.740 --> 45:40.180
No Nintendo system has been a shelf warmer at a Christmas time, except for the virtual

45:40.180 --> 45:43.220
boy, but that was before my time.

45:43.220 --> 45:44.220
Very true.

45:44.220 --> 45:45.220
Very true.

45:45.220 --> 45:49.620
I think the one thing that the three DS is lacking that Nintendo should have jumped on

45:49.620 --> 45:52.100
sooner somehow second analog controller.

45:52.100 --> 45:56.420
Uh, well that's a whole nother issue, but I'm just talking like, you know, format stuff

45:56.420 --> 45:58.700
wise is the three D movies.

45:58.700 --> 46:02.320
They were showing off a lot of the city three, the year that the three DS was shown.

46:02.320 --> 46:06.820
You know, we have Netflix on the three DS, but yet we don't have three D movies yet.

46:06.820 --> 46:08.640
Soon we're going to be able to record three D movies.

46:08.640 --> 46:11.580
Now have you checked out the Nintendo video service that they've got on there?

46:11.580 --> 46:16.180
Yeah, but what little five minute videos I'm talking when they, when we were 83 they were

46:16.180 --> 46:19.520
talking about putting tangled in three D on a little cartridge.

46:19.520 --> 46:23.500
They could, the lion King in three D was the number one movie at the box office this weekend

46:23.500 --> 46:26.240
from 94 they put that thing on a three DS cart.

46:26.240 --> 46:30.900
It's going to sell like crazy, you know, because it's so much cheaper right now and they need

46:30.900 --> 46:32.500
to strike while the iron's hot.

46:32.500 --> 46:37.180
It's so much cheaper right now to invest in the three DS is three D device, then go get

46:37.180 --> 46:40.860
a fricking three D television and glasses, but that's not going to be the case much longer

46:40.860 --> 46:42.260
come a year from now.

46:42.260 --> 46:43.260
Next holiday.

46:43.260 --> 46:45.420
I think three D three D TVs are going to be huge, man.

46:45.420 --> 46:46.740
I can't wait.

46:46.740 --> 46:48.900
Are you waiting to get a three DTV?

46:48.900 --> 46:54.700
I want a three DTV because kind of like Matt, I'm a sucker for technology, but at the same

46:54.700 --> 46:57.300
time as I've gotten older, I've gotten cheaper.

46:57.300 --> 47:01.980
So I'm just like, Oh man, I am not going to spend $3,000 on that.

47:01.980 --> 47:05.500
Especially as fast as technology is getting better and better.

47:05.500 --> 47:11.400
You're definitely in a better position to wait because as soon as you buy one, it's

47:11.400 --> 47:15.460
just like, Oh, Hey look, we came up with this technology that's even 10 times better and

47:15.460 --> 47:16.460
it's cheaper.

47:16.460 --> 47:17.460
It's like, Oh, come on.

47:17.460 --> 47:21.560
Well, when I even, you know, I haven't waited and waited and waited about my 120 Hertz TV

47:21.560 --> 47:25.180
because 120 Hertz was supposed to be the three D rate.

47:25.180 --> 47:28.620
It's like on this TV now we can do three D when the three D comes out.

47:28.620 --> 47:29.620
This TV will work.

47:29.620 --> 47:30.620
I'm like, great.

47:30.620 --> 47:31.620
Now.

47:31.620 --> 47:32.620
Fuck you.

47:32.620 --> 47:33.620
It's gotta be two 40.

47:33.620 --> 47:34.620
Fuck you guys.

47:34.620 --> 47:35.740
Fuck you right in the ear.

47:35.740 --> 47:36.960
But that's okay.

47:36.960 --> 47:41.480
Going to our chat at chat.orangestonsready.com hit stun says Netflix is in three D right?

47:41.480 --> 47:42.960
Actually it's not, not on the three DS.

47:42.960 --> 47:46.860
I know you would think it would be, but outside of the title screen and I think the menus,

47:46.860 --> 47:49.260
the content itself, not in three D yet.

47:49.260 --> 47:50.260
Who knows?

47:50.260 --> 47:51.260
Who knows what might happen?

47:51.260 --> 47:54.600
Uh, and then, uh, Kevin six eight in our chat at chat.orangestonsready.com says, I'm not

47:54.600 --> 47:57.100
really into three D. I mean, it's more of a novelty to me.

47:57.100 --> 47:58.400
See, I'm kind of there too.

47:58.400 --> 48:01.580
And I feel a little weird talking about like hyping up three D and everything, but I think

48:01.580 --> 48:05.840
for games three D might actually kind of be neat.

48:05.840 --> 48:09.140
Like I got to admit some of the three DS stuff's got cool.

48:09.140 --> 48:14.900
Like it's a little bitty screen and so forth, but it is, it's, it's, it's neat at least

48:14.900 --> 48:15.900
for a little while.

48:15.900 --> 48:18.560
I think the Mario Kart game is going to be kind of neat, but I think there probably will

48:18.560 --> 48:22.280
be a point where I'm like, okay, let's, let's turn the three off now.

48:22.280 --> 48:28.300
See with Mario Kart, it's just, it's a perfect example of what Nintendo does wrong and Mario

48:28.300 --> 48:32.980
Kart, what they've done is every game only sells like 11 D gajillion copies.

48:32.980 --> 48:36.220
I understand that because people are suckers and they're like, Oh, it's a Mario game.

48:36.220 --> 48:37.460
I want to buy it.

48:37.460 --> 48:38.460
Fine.

48:38.460 --> 48:39.460
That's not why it happens.

48:39.460 --> 48:41.500
It's because the Mario Kart games are good.

48:41.500 --> 48:42.500
Really?

48:42.500 --> 48:44.340
They're not creative.

48:44.340 --> 48:51.780
They're not innovative, but they're always super fun and anyone can play them and they

48:51.780 --> 48:53.060
just, they just last.

48:53.060 --> 48:58.700
The one series that Nintendo really doesn't need to do anything to, you know how, you

48:58.700 --> 49:01.580
know, they put out stuff and don't really do anything like animal crossing.

49:01.580 --> 49:05.100
They change absolutely nothing and they put out the new game on another system and Hey,

49:05.100 --> 49:06.980
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

49:06.980 --> 49:10.620
In the new animal crossing, you will get to sit on a bench and swim.

49:10.620 --> 49:11.620
But that's fine.

49:11.620 --> 49:12.620
Okay.

49:12.620 --> 49:13.620
Two things.

49:13.620 --> 49:16.660
Um, and it's in a different camera perspective, whoopty shit.

49:16.660 --> 49:20.180
Um, but one of the series that they don't really need to do anything to is Mario Kart.

49:20.180 --> 49:23.980
I mean, Mario Kart was always good as it was hang gliders.

49:23.980 --> 49:24.980
Yeah.

49:24.980 --> 49:25.980
Hang gliders.

49:25.980 --> 49:26.980
That's awesome.

49:26.980 --> 49:32.780
Um, or you know, they've ruined battle mode, you know, after the 64 versions after the

49:32.780 --> 49:33.780
first one.

49:33.780 --> 49:35.300
No, it was, it was good.

49:35.300 --> 49:37.060
A 64 version was still fun.

49:37.060 --> 49:39.780
Good on like that flat out with seven battle screen.

49:39.780 --> 49:41.100
It was so cool.

49:41.100 --> 49:46.140
It was, Mario Kart 64 is an awesome game that I haven't spent enough time with.

49:46.140 --> 49:49.740
So it was blocked for, it was awesome in Mario Kart 64.

49:49.740 --> 49:54.740
I mean, that's where it was at, but you know, now they're just, they're trying too hard,

49:54.740 --> 49:55.740
I guess.

49:55.740 --> 49:58.980
Cause with Double Dash it was like, oh look, you can have a partner, you can switch back

49:58.980 --> 49:59.980
and forth.

49:59.980 --> 50:00.980
No, that was terrible.

50:00.980 --> 50:05.980
And then now, and then now they have like, oh look, hey, uh, we're going to have motorcycles

50:05.980 --> 50:09.300
and monster trucks and hang gliders and underwater sub things.

50:09.300 --> 50:10.300
Who gives a shit?

50:10.300 --> 50:11.300
It's a kart racing game.

50:11.300 --> 50:15.740
If you ever come over the one year that we put up like an eight player system like Mario

50:15.740 --> 50:16.740
Kart game.

50:16.740 --> 50:17.740
No.

50:17.740 --> 50:18.740
That was so great.

50:18.740 --> 50:20.780
It was like, I'm going to be controlling the rear guy and just punting people.

50:20.780 --> 50:23.420
It was like amazing.

50:23.420 --> 50:26.420
Let me, let me, let me try to kind of move on the conversation a little bit here, but,

50:26.420 --> 50:30.220
but Jamie, Jamie, I want to hear from you for a minute because Nintendo is targeting

50:30.220 --> 50:32.460
women.

50:32.460 --> 50:35.940
What do you think the 3DS's chances are this Christmas?

50:35.940 --> 50:37.780
It's going to be good cause it's an Nintendo system.

50:37.780 --> 50:40.280
I mean people buy Nintendo systems.

50:40.280 --> 50:41.280
That's really it.

50:41.280 --> 50:45.860
And people are going to buy the shit that comes out, like imagine babies and fart monsters

50:45.860 --> 50:46.860
or something.

50:46.860 --> 50:50.580
Do they have a game called fart monster 3D?

50:50.580 --> 50:56.980
No, they have, um, let's see what would be the closest thing to that.

50:56.980 --> 50:58.340
They have pet zombies.

50:58.340 --> 51:00.020
You can raise your own pet zombie.

51:00.020 --> 51:01.020
That's kind of fun.

51:01.020 --> 51:02.020
Shitting me.

51:02.020 --> 51:03.020
No.

51:03.020 --> 51:04.020
That's awesomely bad.

51:04.020 --> 51:05.020
All right.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.460
I would play that cause it's awesomely bad.

51:07.460 --> 51:10.780
Now we got to get back to some of this stuff on the Vita cause go ahead.

51:10.780 --> 51:15.300
I was going to say if they want to, you know, sell me one, just give me my Kid Icarus already.

51:15.300 --> 51:16.300
Soon.

51:16.300 --> 51:17.300
Next year.

51:17.300 --> 51:18.300
All right.

51:18.300 --> 51:21.980
Uh, by the way, cause some of the, uh, audio or excuse me, some of the chat is pointing

51:21.980 --> 51:23.700
out that Dan's audio is in and out.

51:23.700 --> 51:24.700
He's using the shit.

51:24.700 --> 51:28.940
He does have the busted mic right now cause I had to put a mic by the door so that Dan

51:28.940 --> 51:30.860
would come in here and yell random shit.

51:30.860 --> 51:35.980
He might be encouraged to pick up a mic and say it into the microphone, but unfortunately

51:35.980 --> 51:38.320
the only microphone we have is the half busted one.

51:38.320 --> 51:40.840
So I apologize to the shoddy audio quality.

51:40.840 --> 51:41.840
We hear that.

51:41.840 --> 51:42.840
Thank you Dan.

51:42.840 --> 51:43.840
No, actually now we can't.

51:43.840 --> 51:44.840
There you go.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.340
Just hold the cord.

51:46.340 --> 51:47.340
Yeah.

51:47.340 --> 51:48.340
You just have to do it.

51:48.340 --> 51:49.340
You have to kind of just kind of push it together.

51:49.340 --> 51:50.900
Like it's a falling apart.

51:50.900 --> 51:52.620
All right.

51:52.620 --> 51:53.620
More Vita news.

51:53.620 --> 51:56.260
My husband's a prevert.

51:56.260 --> 52:01.980
I mentioned this in the, uh, over overview of what all games are coming out, but I just

52:01.980 --> 52:03.140
kind of want to revisit.

52:03.140 --> 52:09.240
Uh, it was announced that zone of the enders HD collection and metal gear solid is coming

52:09.240 --> 52:16.540
to the Vita, uh, as well as Ninja Gaiden, ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three Katamari.

52:16.540 --> 52:21.100
And this was the huge bombshell that was dropped.

52:21.100 --> 52:27.300
Final fantasy 10 remake or HD version or whatever they're calling it is coming out.

52:27.300 --> 52:31.300
We're going to do a remake of final fantasy final fantasy 10.

52:31.300 --> 52:32.300
Yeah.

52:32.300 --> 52:35.360
They don't go with when everyone wants, they just go with one that all they have to do

52:35.360 --> 52:38.100
is update a few textures on and boom.

52:38.100 --> 52:39.340
Well I think you hit the nail on the head.

52:39.340 --> 52:43.100
There's far less work to be done with final fantasy 10 and they can get it done a lot

52:43.100 --> 52:44.100
faster.

52:44.100 --> 52:45.100
Not even updating the textures.

52:45.100 --> 52:46.100
It's just uprising.

52:46.100 --> 52:47.100
I don't know though.

52:47.100 --> 52:48.340
No, I've given that too much.

52:48.340 --> 52:54.920
Uh, I'm being too hard on them because the, you know, um, Ico shadow class collection

52:54.920 --> 52:56.920
is actually pretty good.

52:56.920 --> 52:59.460
So all this is a third part.

52:59.460 --> 53:00.460
Is that out?

53:00.460 --> 53:05.300
I need to get that out this it's either this week or next week.

53:05.300 --> 53:06.300
I got to get that.

53:06.300 --> 53:07.620
But anyways, no, actually I'm sorry.

53:07.620 --> 53:09.720
That is a third party company and so it's not Sony.

53:09.720 --> 53:16.220
So yeah, it's just going to be up res textures, um, and polygons.

53:16.220 --> 53:23.320
It's going to be Konami stuff or Konami quality, which there was a lot of like Twitter rage

53:23.320 --> 53:26.980
on seven fans versus 10 fans this week when the remake was announced.

53:26.980 --> 53:29.900
I noticed it was just kind of like the answer seems obvious to me.

53:29.900 --> 53:32.780
Ten's just an easier thing to remain in both games.

53:32.780 --> 53:34.700
Both games are equally popular in Japan.

53:34.700 --> 53:39.500
Well yeah, um, uprising into HD is a little different than remaking the whole damn game.

53:39.500 --> 53:41.680
You know, one is a lot easier to do than the other.

53:41.680 --> 53:45.340
So that's why you don't have a set because if you all press seven, it's going to look

53:45.340 --> 53:46.340
like shit.

53:46.340 --> 53:48.980
And I don't know why there's so many 10 haters.

53:48.980 --> 53:52.380
I don't know if it's because of like the whiny emo voice acting and stuff, but like Lulu

53:52.380 --> 53:54.940
is like one of the most bad-ass characters like in a video game.

53:54.940 --> 53:57.260
I really like 10 too.

53:57.260 --> 53:59.300
I really like 10 too.

53:59.300 --> 54:00.300
10 two's okay.

54:00.300 --> 54:04.700
I was like, yay, 10 too is fun and festive.

54:04.700 --> 54:07.380
Some days you want to have crazy hat day.

54:07.380 --> 54:08.380
It's the girl fest.

54:08.380 --> 54:10.740
I love it.

54:10.740 --> 54:13.980
So especially because there was like this whole area, like when you're on that long

54:13.980 --> 54:18.260
road that you could just cycle back through your dress fears and like level them all up

54:18.260 --> 54:21.980
super quickly, like over and over again if you had a couple hours to spend on it.

54:21.980 --> 54:25.700
Well who knows if Final Fantasy 10 sells well enough in a remake edition or what have you,

54:25.700 --> 54:26.700
they might have 10 too.

54:26.700 --> 54:29.580
Give us seven you whores.

54:29.580 --> 54:33.620
Here's my other question is, uh, and I don't know if you know this Loki, but some people

54:33.620 --> 54:37.220
are saying that this Final Fantasy 10 remake is not just for the Vita, that it's for the

54:37.220 --> 54:43.660
PlayStation three as well as that was, wow, that's, Kevin 68 makes a good point.

54:43.660 --> 54:44.660
What's that?

54:44.660 --> 54:45.660
Aaron was bad ass.

54:45.660 --> 54:46.660
Yes, he was.

54:46.660 --> 54:47.660
He was so bad ass.

54:47.660 --> 54:49.740
They put him in kingdom hearts as well.

54:49.740 --> 54:50.740
You know what?

54:50.740 --> 54:51.740
Hmm.

54:51.740 --> 54:54.700
He was like the only, cause you know, I leveled through the game so quickly.

54:54.700 --> 54:58.300
Well, I went through the game without leveling so quickly, but by the time I got to that

54:58.300 --> 55:05.220
last, uh, um, what was that fucker's name with the blue hair that started with a G.

55:05.220 --> 55:06.220
Ject?

55:06.220 --> 55:09.500
No, the bad guy with the blue hair that tried to marry Yuna.

55:09.500 --> 55:10.500
Oh, fuckwad.

55:10.500 --> 55:11.500
His name is fuckwad.

55:11.500 --> 55:17.480
By the time I got to fuckwad again, after the glyph mine battle, I was like dead and

55:17.480 --> 55:22.140
he was the only one that lived cause I didn't level, but he was a bad ass.

55:22.140 --> 55:25.800
Uh, tiger claw in our chat room says, what about that Final Fantasy musical game they

55:25.800 --> 55:26.800
are making?

55:26.800 --> 55:29.740
What is it on, it's, it's a three ds, not a Vita game, but it's that that's her river

55:29.740 --> 55:31.820
rhythm or whatever it was called.

55:31.820 --> 55:32.820
It looked dumb.

55:32.820 --> 55:34.620
Well, here's the thing.

55:34.620 --> 55:41.100
If the game was like $20 maybe, but $40, no thank you.

55:41.100 --> 55:45.800
Listen to last week's show and the whole price tag grant because I want, what are the Vita

55:45.800 --> 55:50.920
games going to be priced out of there all going to be 40 bucks to 50 shut the fuck up

55:50.920 --> 55:51.920
for real.

55:51.920 --> 55:53.820
Vita games are going to be 50 bucks.

55:53.820 --> 55:54.820
Hello.

55:54.820 --> 55:56.980
PSP games were fucking 50 bucks.

55:56.980 --> 55:59.260
Oh my God.

55:59.260 --> 56:00.260
I don't know.

56:00.260 --> 56:01.260
Apparently my head's been in the sand.

56:01.260 --> 56:05.460
I didn't buy a whole lot of PS 1540 it'll be a PSP price.

56:05.460 --> 56:06.460
I think.

56:06.460 --> 56:08.940
Um, I don't know, maybe 60.

56:08.940 --> 56:14.140
The only price I've seen so far is on, um, Lego Harry Potter.

56:14.140 --> 56:16.600
And that was, I think it was 50.

56:16.600 --> 56:20.540
It was Seymour Guado.

56:20.540 --> 56:21.540
That's right.

56:21.540 --> 56:22.540
It was Seymour.

56:22.540 --> 56:23.660
You want to see more Guado?

56:23.660 --> 56:25.460
I like fuck wad, Seymour fuck wad.

56:25.460 --> 56:29.940
Um, but yeah, that's the only one that, cause the only two titles that I actually have info

56:29.940 --> 56:36.180
on were, um, Lego Harry Potter two and um, dragon something.

56:36.180 --> 56:37.940
I don't remember the hell the other one was called.

56:37.940 --> 56:40.560
Like dragons, dragon dust or I don't know.

56:40.560 --> 56:44.660
Suddenly buying the Magica Uber edition for 10 bucks on steam doesn't seem like such a

56:44.660 --> 56:50.280
bad idea because like game pricing is so fucked up right now.

56:50.280 --> 56:57.180
Like I just, it's, we're in such this crazy state that we haven't been in gaming's history.

56:57.180 --> 57:00.580
Games have always kind of been around that same price, but now we've got 99 cent angry

57:00.580 --> 57:02.580
birds versus $50 Vita games.

57:02.580 --> 57:03.980
It's all about production value though.

57:03.980 --> 57:07.040
I mean, look at, look at the games that they're putting out now.

57:07.040 --> 57:08.040
What they have to do.

57:08.040 --> 57:12.540
They have, you know, Hollywood, um, voice actors and not all games have that, but they

57:12.540 --> 57:17.300
have, you know, teams of hundreds of people, you know, putting these things together for

57:17.300 --> 57:21.500
a long period of time versus angry birds, which could have been made by one or two guys

57:21.500 --> 57:22.500
in maybe a weekend.

57:22.500 --> 57:27.660
I mean, that's why that's 99 cents and that's why those games are 60 bucks because they

57:27.660 --> 57:29.460
also have to advertise.

57:29.460 --> 57:30.460
They have to do all that stuff.

57:30.460 --> 57:34.020
And yes, they can go the different route and try to do more casual stuff and stuff that

57:34.020 --> 57:35.020
costs less.

57:35.020 --> 57:37.180
But what about movies?

57:37.180 --> 57:40.340
Because like, you know, the Blair Witch project was made for what, like a nickel and then

57:40.340 --> 57:44.140
you had like Titanic and it costs the same to see both of those movies.

57:44.140 --> 57:47.260
Now I guess I understand now that with the 3D is throwing this interesting monkey wrench

57:47.260 --> 57:51.100
into it, you're not going to see independent 3D movies right now or right now anyway.

57:51.100 --> 57:52.100
Well, yes.

57:52.100 --> 57:55.500
So I understand that they're, you know, movies when they come to the theaters are all the

57:55.500 --> 57:59.420
same price, but that's, you know, up to the studios to make that decision whether they

57:59.420 --> 58:03.340
want to have a high budget movie or a low budget movie, you know, being put in there.

58:03.340 --> 58:06.540
And yeah, it's all gonna be the same price, but you know, they're charging these theaters

58:06.540 --> 58:11.620
a hell of a lot of money to put them in there and then they sell them on DVD and you know,

58:11.620 --> 58:17.580
yeah, DVD prices are, you know, it fluctuates depending on where you buy them, but it's

58:17.580 --> 58:21.400
because they've already had it out there and they've already made some money back from

58:21.400 --> 58:26.700
it already before they've gone and sold it on DVD or video on demand or however else

58:26.700 --> 58:28.740
you consume your entertainment.

58:28.740 --> 58:32.860
I guess it really just depends on what the quality of the game is, though, and how much

58:32.860 --> 58:33.860
you're into it.

58:33.860 --> 58:36.420
Like, and that's the interesting thing about Steam, too, is that it's kind of like one

58:36.420 --> 58:40.220
of those, well, once we've sold it to everybody, we think it's gonna buy it for 50 bucks, let's

58:40.220 --> 58:41.220
try to knock it down to 40.

58:41.220 --> 58:42.220
Like it's-

58:42.220 --> 58:43.220
Yeah.

58:43.220 --> 58:44.220
We can name that tune.

58:44.220 --> 58:45.220
Where I have-

58:45.220 --> 58:46.220
I'll buy that game for 50 bucks.

58:46.220 --> 58:49.220
But at the same time, though, I have a problem with a game that's terrible, that's being

58:49.220 --> 58:54.980
sold for $60 when it clearly looks like it's like an up-res PlayStation 2 game, or in the

58:54.980 --> 58:59.880
case of Activision and EA, where they put out Rock Band and Guitar Hero and they sell

58:59.880 --> 59:08.060
it for 60 bucks on the Wii, I mean, dude, it's less production quality for that version

59:08.060 --> 59:09.860
of the game than it was the other ones.

59:09.860 --> 59:14.340
Cinderwolf in our chatroom at chat.orangetowntrady.com says, as a retailer, the greater profit is

59:14.340 --> 59:22.260
in selling 200 copies at $30 rather than 50 copies at $50.

59:22.260 --> 59:23.260
Depends what you're talking about.

59:23.260 --> 59:27.700
I mean, if you're talking about games, there's no money to be made anywhere, but if you're

59:27.700 --> 59:30.740
talking about movies, then that's a different story.

59:30.740 --> 59:31.740
All right.

59:31.740 --> 59:33.520
Let's move on with some more news stories.

59:33.520 --> 59:37.260
We could talk all night about how games are really expensive, but at the end of the day,

59:37.260 --> 59:40.420
like seriously, if Civilization VI was announced and they were gonna charge a hundred bucks

59:40.420 --> 59:44.740
for it, I'd probably still pay it.

59:44.740 --> 59:45.740
It just really depends on the game.

59:45.740 --> 59:46.740
You're part of the problem, Rob.

59:46.740 --> 59:47.740
Yeah, I am.

59:47.740 --> 59:48.740
That's fine.

59:48.740 --> 59:49.740
Okay.

59:49.740 --> 59:54.620
Hey, some people spent 150 bucks on these limited edition, like Call of Duty's, World

59:54.620 --> 01:00:01.780
of Warcraft's, Oblivion, or excuse me, Skyrim, you know, whatever game, so they make hundreds

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.080
of bucks off people somehow.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.060
Some people imported games for a lot of money too.

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.620
Yeah, who imported the game that came with a fucking dish?

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.620
Dark Sakura.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.620
You know what?

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:14.820
I didn't actually import that, I bought it in an import store and I didn't pay that much

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:15.820
for it.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.180
Hey, are you a fan of Lord of the Rings?

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.780
Because they've got a Lord of the Rings War of the North thing that's coming out, it comes

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.980
in a quiver, a leather quiver.

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.700
I remember you mentioning that.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.920
For the record, I am not a Lord of the Rings fan.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.920
The movies were okay.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.920
Are you a fan of leather quivers?

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920
No.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.960
The movies were okay and the books, the stories were great.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.780
The stories, but Tolkien's writing pisses me off.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:39.780
Are you a fan of guns?

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.780
Yes.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.140
Because there's a Red Dead Redemption coming out with a six shooter.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.140
You want a gun?

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.220
I want a gun!

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:46.220
I just made that up.

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.340
He totally made that up.

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.740
We actually went looking at guns.

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:52.380
I just want Dark Sakura to get excited about a gun.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.380
I want a gun.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.380
I don't want Dark Sakura to own a gun.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.380
Why?

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.380
Because you'll shoot me!

01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.680
I won't.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.680
No I won't.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.780
Just because someone has a gun doesn't mean that they'll use a gun.

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:08.540
Yeah but we're talking about you though.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:13.460
It would be safely in a locker and I would go outside to shoot it.

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.460
You're right in the face.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:20.620
We're waiting until you get outside of the house so that way we can say you were a prowler.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:24.140
The next time Shermie shits on the floor she's gonna get it.

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.140
No.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.740
Yeah she can absorb a bullet and be fine.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:27.740
She's right there.

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.740
Bounce right off her.

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.740
Be nice to the cat.

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:30.740
I wouldn't shoot the cat.

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.740
I like her better than anyone else in this room.

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:39.460
As they put it in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, she's cultivating mass.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.180
She's cultivating sleep right now.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.180
Dark Sakura let's move on with some gaming news.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.740
Sony are bitches.

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:46.740
Wait.

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:51.460
They actually amended their online terms to block class action lawsuits.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:56.340
It's actually a section called binding individual arbitration.

01:01:56.340 --> 01:02:02.660
So to quote it says any dispute resolution proceedings whether in arbitration or court

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:07.780
will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in the class or representative action

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:12.820
as a named or unnamed member in the class consolidation representative or private attorney

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.980
general action.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:20.300
So basically if you want to use our shit you can't sue us in the class action.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.900
But you can opt out.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:22.940
Yes you can opt out of it.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.780
You can send Sony a postcard or whatever and opt out of that.

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:29.380
I want to make specially made postcards of Sony.

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.260
That's a big middle finger.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.300
Opt out of this bitch.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.440
Well here's what it says.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:39.340
If you do not agree with the new terms of service or privacy policy or if you do not

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:44.180
wish to enter into an agreement with Sony you may decline the TOS and privacy policy

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:48.580
and we will close your account and return your funds.

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.420
So in other words if you want to opt out then fuck off.

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:52.900
You can't use our service at all.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.880
So it's not just a opt out because I want to sue you someday.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.380
You know the only reason I'm like whatever Sony is because the PlayStation Network is

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.380
free.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:06.180
So it's kind of one of those you know whatever but at the same time there is PlayStation

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.180
Plus.

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.180
Go ahead.

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:13.860
It says more actually says if the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:17.860
the entire section 15 will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:22.020
and you and the Sony entity you have a dispute with each agree to waive.

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.460
In that instance to the fullest extent allowed by the law in a trial by jury.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.960
So in other words this may not actually be legal.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.300
And if it ends up being illegal then you never said anything but there is a court case of

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.960
the AT&T that already set precedent that this is legal.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960
So wow.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.660
You know not much you can do there.

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.660
I don't know.

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:41.660
That's just it does seem a little bit.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.660
Here's here's the thing.

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.100
What am I actually going to sue Sony.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.460
I mean what are they going to do to me.

01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.380
That's really going to have me sue them.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:49.380
Nothing.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.360
I mean you know my cause I see them individually.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.760
I'm still waiting on your own.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.940
I'm still waiting for money back from Microsoft.

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:58.220
I'm more likely to sue them before I sue Sony.

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.540
Well it's basically saying you're sorry.

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:02.540
Go ahead.

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:03.540
Go ahead.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.540
I was going to say.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:08.540
But you'll be suing on an individual basis and not as a class action through Microsoft

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:12.260
has nothing to do with Sony true.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.480
That's the whole point is like you can hire an attorney and you can spend all the money

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:21.020
to sue them on your own and get you know maybe 15000.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:26.060
I'm just using an arbitrary figure 15000 dollars were as opposed to a class action lawsuit

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:32.420
with maybe a million users and each of them get five dollars that's five million bucks.

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.660
You know think about that.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:40.820
It's it's a way to basically save their assets not assets assets and also because they're

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:44.780
a bigger company and they have money to throw at this type of stuff they can just drag it

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:47.420
out forever until you run out of money to fight it right.

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.700
It's kind of an intimidation thing it's kind of one of those where bigger than you are

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:58.100
so you can sue us and we'll just get scary scary station network but well you may not

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:03.060
use PlayStation Network but as Loki said AT&T set a precedent for this so maybe Sony setting

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:06.500
a precedent for this in the gaming world and by the time the Wii U comes out with its online

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:15.940
service it'll have something like this as well and Xbox Live may adopt a similar policy

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:21.640
when it does a little remodel this really needs to be because basically it's like they're

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:24.340
trying to manipulate the court system.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:34.500
They should have no jurisdiction in determining how someone can legally challenge.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.980
I like this salacious pop is just rambling about this in our chat room so I want to read

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.020
some of these comments here at chat dot orange on twitter dot com.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.300
That is embarrassingly dumb.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.660
The only reason why you'd ever need to be approached to be part of a class action and

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:50.140
having that class action go to trial is because there's obviously clearly incompetent shit

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:54.860
going on on a wide scale that is the point of a class action oh my god if you try to

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:58.820
form a class action and you don't have a case and you're just a butt mad neckbeard you'll

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:03.280
be laughed out of court class actions are the only real way you can make a company pay

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:08.580
huge punitive damages as punishment for their shady dealings in an individual case if you're

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:12.900
in the right yeah you'll get paid well but it won't be punitive damages kind of money

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:20.580
so sony is trying to protect their wallet that's exactly it i like butt mad neckbeard

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:25.580
makes me think of those guys that get up and ask questions at blizzcon well that's exactly

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:30.880
it i mean that was pretty much the the point i was trying to make they're trying to save

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.860
money and you know not basically have to take any responsibility for the shit that they're

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:39.300
doing at the end of the day i don't really like it but i hit accept anyway because i

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:45.260
wanted to like play my games online so well that's the problem what can you do that right

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:50.300
there is the problem i mean not no offense or anything i'm not like pointing at you but

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:55.460
that is that's why they they can get away with it because people will say oh i just

01:06:55.460 --> 01:07:00.040
want to play my games i don't give a shit but that's how they're going to get away with

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.700
it but because there's going to be too many people what can you do what can you do how

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:08.100
can you hold this company accountable like i i still believe like even though whatever

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:13.700
at&t said a precedent if they fuck up on the scale of the network breach again i'm sorry

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:19.540
this little passage 15 isn't going to hold up you know congress is investigating sony

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:24.820
for their fuck up you know what i mean like if like you know they don't have a you know

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:31.300
deficit or anything to worry about so i don't know it's just but the whole the whole point

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:35.060
is that by sitting around and doing nothing they're going to get away with this as long

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:39.100
as they can a lot of people are going to get serious internet rage dark soccer that is

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:44.400
how we're responding with internet rage i am very upset at sony well there actually

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:48.140
is a number of things you can do you can write your you know your representatives to you

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:53.740
know double check the legality of this because uh clearly they're not going to you know they'd

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:57.860
have to evaluate it on a state-by-state basis too to see if any of that's going to fly because

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:04.060
they have to deal with state laws as well and they can't stand in the way of you know

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:08.780
legal proceeding or you can send loki's card with the giant middle finger i'm trying to

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:13.100
be serious i know i know the whole point is that it's something that should not be allowed

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:20.820
to to pass uh marisa con gusto in our chat room says there is pending legislation about

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:25.460
word salad legal agreements but this won't stop arbitration clauses which you are a part

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:30.500
of in many areas that you don't even know of that's very true very common like cell

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:35.040
phone agreements and just all sorts of anything you sign probably has some stupid arbitration

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:42.060
clause in it this country that that that that that that that i'd be interested though how

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:47.980
does sony protect themselves in other countries because if they were to screw up again that

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:54.820
might hold a legal thing in the u.s but did they have to do the same thing in canada or

01:08:54.820 --> 01:09:01.740
they'd probably do whatever the equivalent law is you know have something kind of interesting

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:05.300
i don't know all right let's move on with some more gaming news we could talk about

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:10.340
this all night but so final fantasy 10 the remake is not the only final fantasy that's

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:15.820
coming out uh there's also well final fantasy 14 i guess is never coming out but um never

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:22.220
coming out working that is haha um but final fantasy 13 too though is on its way out it

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:28.980
is 90 complete as of tokyo game show and um they're showing some cool stuff including

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:34.380
there's going to be some bonus um features if you have a safe game for the original 13

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:39.800
game also there's going to be 150 monsters to raise and chocables uh will be writable

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:47.340
anywhere in the game and i guess they also have a series unique red chocobo as well that'll

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:54.380
be available and um i guess the game itself will feature time travel so that's kind of

01:09:54.380 --> 01:10:03.100
neat um the game is launching uh next year on the north american region uh january 31st

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:09.260
and also uh europe is getting february 2nd japan is though seeing it this year on december

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:17.700
15th um plus they're also launching in japan with a exclusive uh playstation 3 system that's

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:24.540
pink and black and it's got a laser etched uh lightning on it the lightning edition version

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:32.520
2 which will include a 320 gigabyte hard drive the game and a controller for the price of

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:40.820
37,960 yen or 495 that's pretty awesome i don't know does seem a little weird that they're

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:45.860
releasing like a whole new playstation though like i don't know it's just it's just a limited

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:49.380
edition i mean whatever they did call dude wouldn't the final fantasy fans have already

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:57.020
bought one for final fantasy 13 the original um yeah maybe i don't know um and of course

01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:02.500
as we said earlier uh final fantasy 10 the remake for playstation vita and playstation

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:08.140
3 that'll be coming out later on my bad on that loki sorry that's all right no big deal

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:12.100
we have to mention again because it's awesome it i it's something i'm gonna probably pick

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:15.700
up no doubt no i would love to see what i mean obviously this won't happen till they

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:22.540
kill off the playstation 2 version of it but uh an hd remake version of final fantasy 11

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:26.260
that's free to play would be awesome i could happen didn't i talk about this a couple weeks

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.740
ago on the show that they were investigating dumping the playstation 2 you yeah you did

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:33.860
mention that but actually hasn't there been a rumor about 11 on the vita already i think

01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:37.820
there has yeah oh can you imagine if that game goes free to play i don't know what i'm

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:44.660
gonna do the wife won't have a reason to stop you now well you know what see here's the

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.860
thing though the only reason i didn't have i stopped my subscription because i don't

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:53.460
get a lot of time to play so it may be like maybe an hour or two every few days but if

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:58.940
it's free to play who gives a shit so i don't play for a few days or weeks or whatever i'm

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:06.980
not paying for it let me go to this next story which is uh yeah this is this is interesting

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:11.620
because this is about reviews uh and so we're gonna talk about game reviews for a little

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:16.460
bit as you know gears of war 3 is on its way out and it's it's kind of a big deal like

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:20.540
if you're into these types of shooter games at all it's kind of a big deal and the game's

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:24.620
getting good reviews it's getting a lot of great reviews glowing reviews everywhere uh

01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:31.620
there was an article however with vg247.com that cliff basinski or cliffy b did talking

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:36.500
about gears of war let me read the little passage of the interview here were you pleased

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:41.920
with the review scores this morning asked the website cliff b said doing great apart

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:47.460
from a couple of haters magazine asked who were the haters and he said a certain gamer

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:53.140
of the euro so kind of uh calling out euro gamer and what was their problem with the

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:57.420
game i haven't read the review asked the magazine to which cliffy b followed up you know i don't

01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:02.100
quite gather it i don't want to come across as defensive how do i phrase this properly

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:07.180
when people rated gear 2 higher than gears 3 it kind of upset me because i know gears

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:12.980
3 is a better game on every level now here's the punch line it sounds like eurogamer really

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:16.620
trashed the shit out of this game didn't it which they have done to some games and that

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:23.300
they put this game in the toilet this game got an 8 out of 10 by eurogamer and they are

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:29.820
haters because the game got an 8 out of 10 that's stupid care to elaborate why is it

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:35.900
stupid i don't know why would someone just start this off because i mean 8 out of 10

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:41.980
is good it's well above average you know maybe it's like oh i wanted a 9 out of 10 or 10

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:45.980
out of 10 because it was exceptional it's perfect we can do no wrong maybe it sounds

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:50.540
to me like the issue is gears 2 must have got a 9 or a 10 from the same website and

01:13:50.540 --> 01:14:01.260
they dared to rate this game an 8 probably i mean i review scores you kind of have to

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:05.780
take with a grain of salt anyway i mean it's not like they rated a game of four and there

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:09.980
were some reviews out there on the internet they're rated final fantasy 13 a four out

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.860
of 10 i'm sorry look at duke nukem forever perfect example like there's a ton of shitty

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:20.300
reviews and there's a ton of really good reviews for it you have to look at your reviewer you

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:25.220
know that's why i always thought that one of the most fair um reviewing systems was

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:33.420
how um game pro used to do it so with their little uh faces emoticons no no no no how

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:39.180
they would have like pick one game and have five people score it oh that was an egm thing

01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:43.260
now yeah that was egm sorry which is basically for me too well game pro used to do um two

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:49.220
people back and forth but i liked i liked how you would have the main reviewer who would

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:53.420
go over the the major points in the game and then you'd have what everyone else thought

01:14:53.420 --> 01:15:01.060
of it and the average score is this that's fair i'm sorry first off why does anyone give

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:05.260
a shit what cliffy b wants because cliffy b is a fucking douchebag that's what it comes

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:09.220
down to he is a fucking douchebag he thinks he's a goddamn rock star because he has a

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:14.340
few good games under his belt yeah great okay yeah epic games make some pretty cool shit

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:21.560
and you act like a fucking douchebag so wow your game got an eight on one website go fucking

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.180
cry in a corner then you little bitch it's it's interesting though because like if the

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:29.640
game is that good then the review shouldn't matter right well here's the thing then if

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:35.340
you're so you know hard up on you know getting an 8.0 and stuff fine why don't you blacklist

01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:39.280
eurogamer then if you're gonna take the high ground with that well my game was better i

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.100
thought so because i made it yeah you know what i bet people that thought you know i

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:48.060
bet the people that worked hard on duke nukem forever thought it was a great game too you

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:53.340
know you don't see them fucking crying the number one movie at the box office every year

01:15:53.340 --> 01:16:02.620
is rarely the most well reviewed think about that because a lot of people have no taste

01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:09.940
no he is a fucking douchebag plain and simple i don't really know the guy and i don't watch

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:14.300
a lot of television which we talked about earlier video game related stuff so i don't

01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:19.340
know i i saw him once at e3 doing a demo i think at the first years of war game like

01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:23.780
a long time ago he seemed fine to me whatever i don't i don't got a problem come on but

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:29.100
i i don't think an eight out of ten makes somebody a hater i understand you know if

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:32.700
i understand he's passionate about his game that's fine but you know what if i made a

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:37.340
fucking game and one site reviewed it you know a point lower than everybody else i wouldn't

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:41.280
care i'd be like okay that's their opinion fine you know what if everybody rated it like

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:45.460
a one or something like that or if like they came out and said i fucking hate the gears

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:48.780
war series so i'm going to give it a one out of ten or something like that then yeah he

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.740
could be pissed off but eight out of ten is just fine i don't understand what the big

01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:56.300
deal is well it was like when the websites were giving final fantasy 13 of four out of

01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:00.420
ten i was like okay these are the websites i can't trust their reviews ever again because

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:04.220
they're smoking crack over there they don't like the same games i like clearly remember

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:09.020
there were multiple websites that were bombing final fantasy 13 because it was too linear

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:13.060
but but i obviously didn't play uh far enough to find out when the game opens with the same

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:19.440
time though yes that's fine and it's up to the people reading i mean if you're dumb enough

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:23.560
to just go okay well this guy didn't like the game so i'm not gonna like it well yes

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:29.020
if he likes a similar type of games that you like and he didn't like it then yes but if

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:32.460
you're a gamer that's like well listen you can get a nine out of ten i can't buy this

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:36.680
game i'm sorry i don't think there's anyone out there that's like that if you're gonna

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.920
buy years of work because you like years of war it's not because someone gave it an eight

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.440
or nine out of ten and i think eight out of ten is just fine but the fact that he just

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:51.320
went out there and said wow eight out of ten that's what makes him a douchebag i'm sorry

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.320
tiger claw in our chat room at chat.org says you should never base your views on a game

01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:01.200
based on a game review you play these games with an open mind and form your own opinion

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.440
about it i'm mostly inclined to agree with that statement and in theory that's a really

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:12.600
good statement but the only thing is that games cost 60 and if you're on the fence about

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:18.320
a game you gotta go off something i prefer that to be hands-on experience be it game

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:24.440
rental or game kiosk or something i mean usually i only drop 60 on a game on launch day because

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:30.040
i've either a played it at a trade show or b really liked other games in the series so

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:34.080
i've got to get it like civ 5 i bought right when it came out because i like the other

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:38.960
civ games skyrim i will buy day one because it's an elder scrolls game i've seen all the

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:44.560
stuff online i don't think it's going to disappoint me but games i'm on the fence about yeah maybe

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:49.080
i want to see some reviews on before i spend the money on it you know but i also think

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:53.640
the out of 10 system is kind of screwy anyway i just like if i were to review games i don't

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:56.960
write a lot of game reviews because i think i'm a better talker than i am a writer but

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:00.880
like if i were to do reviews like this like well we here on this even show we talk about

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:04.800
our gaming weeks we don't really give games scores uh i just kind of like to summarize

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:11.080
in a couple sentences you'll like this game if you like japanese rpgs otherwise maybe

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.440
and then sometimes there's a game where it's like wow i don't care what type of games you're

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.360
into you've got to check this out because it is doing something that no other game does

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:22.500
you know what i mean like i think that is the best way to sum up a game i think that's

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:28.280
more fair but the typical person wants to just say oh too long didn't read you can't

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:35.160
translate that into a metacritic score right so there you go all right anyhow i just wanted

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:38.560
to talk reviews for a little bit thought that would be a fun little tangent i'm gonna read

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:44.120
it seven out of ten are you going on a metacritic to read it seven i would know i was just gonna

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:48.880
see i want to see what the actual lowest review is on oh critic for sure i just want to see

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:53.560
if you know if anybody bombed it worse than eurogamer destructoid gave it an eight out

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:58.880
of ten as well do you do they well hold on it's metacritic is calling it an 80 but i

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.200
don't know destructories review scale that could also be four out of five stars could

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:05.960
be an eight okay that's still four out of five it's not five out of five or four and

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:11.500
a half out of five that's still 80 well you know what i have a friend who basically like

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:15.520
whenever you know we talk about a movie or something he's always talking about oh well

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.360
rotten tomatoes rated this and blah blah i'm like yeah but what did they say about the

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.080
movie what did they say about the acting what did they say about this because i don't really

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.720
give a crap what the score is i care what the part vinny and you know me i like your

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:32.000
movies that people have blasted if there's fun parts in them i'll watch the movie again

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.240
i'll go see it again i don't care because i enjoyed it my favorite movies are like stupid

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:40.760
movies like i like i like mystery science theater 3000 types of events that's why i

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:45.480
like showgirls so much showgirls is a terrible fucking movie but it is so much fun to watch

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:52.280
i know with friends well you remember my bachelorette party what did we watch barbarella in xanadu

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:56.160
i remember that that was great and then we went to the goth club that was great i think

01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:00.960
that was the last time i went to the goth club that was the last time i went to good

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.040
time anyway well to that one anyway i went to the other ones let's move on let's move

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.120
on uh dark soccer you got a quick story for us and then release dates well basically um

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:14.480
microsoft is saying that um windows 8 will support xbox live but they're not really saying

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:20.200
anything else about games for windows live they're just basically like um uh they're

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:24.080
actual their spokesperson said and they quote we currently have nothing to announce beyond

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:29.840
the statement that major nelson posted on his blog so what i'm thinking is that you're

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:36.640
going to be able to manage your xbox live account and maybe some games will cross over

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:41.800
i think i could see some type of like messenger or video chat tie-in or skype or whatever

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:45.640
ultimate direction they go in i think just a way for like when you are signed into your

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:50.420
computer you are still within the xbox live network yeah what i'm wondering about is that

01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:55.200
does this mean that you know they've talked about going more an app style direction with

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.520
windows 8 which you know obviously although you can use the classic you can you can but

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.020
they're calling like the desktop is like a type of app yeah saying it's weird but obviously

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:08.000
they're going that more apple route which you know is is not too surprising especially

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.280
because this runs on tablets but here's my question does that mean and i'm totally inferring

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:18.980
here but does that mean that apps will be run in microsoft points and maybe your points

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:23.400
are used across systems that would be very well that's how they did it with zoom i thought

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:28.440
zoom marketplace wasn't a all together it could yeah and it could but but at the same

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:33.400
time you know games for windows live or whatever ran in real dollars the my the xbox live does

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:39.400
use real dollars in one portion it's the uh uh buying the old games yeah uh games on demand

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:43.880
games on demand thank you it uses real dollars as opposed to the microsoft points so i could

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:47.360
go either way i don't know well and with points you know you're always gonna have leftover

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:50.380
you're gonna have an odd amount they've i think they've arranged it that way to where

01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:54.000
you buy them you're gonna have some leftover well so if you want to get anything else you've

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.640
still got to have that not anymore actually not anymore uh they have changed the denominations

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.300
that you can buy uh yeah but depending on what you're buying you still i still find

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:08.400
myself left with like 80 points if you're buying you know if you're buying a card or

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.580
something like that where it's twenty dollar you know fifty dollar increments then yes

01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:16.840
you may be left over stuff but they actually do have it now where you can buy 800 400 but

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:21.480
they want you to do that we're like oh i have 80 points in my account i i could get this

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:26.600
stupid little uh little hat for my avatar i never think of that i never think that you

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:31.640
don't but a lot of people do a lot of people do my only crazy purchase i ever did on playstation

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:37.380
network was dressing my character up like a hobo santa and i am still hobo santa in

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:42.420
home which i have not been to forever so probably dead hope santa at this point well and and

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:47.280
to be fair i did buy the taylor swift microphone for my avatar on xbox live actually the only

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:52.060
thing that i thought is i had leftover points and i bought one of the steampunk tops just

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.920
because i thought it was really cute so we've all been guilty of buying some stupid shit

01:23:54.920 --> 01:24:01.320

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:05.080
stories before you guys before we get to the classic game of the week but first loki yes

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:09.400
um i think we talked a little bit about it last week how there was a cable company in

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:16.880
canada that was actually throttling uh internet speeds with uh gaming on them and it's actually

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:22.680
a little bit of a follow-up to that they've uh the canadian radio and television telecommunications

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:29.840
commission that's a mouthful uh cited that rogers own policy which claims that the online

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.240
games like world of warcraft um should not be throttled and telling the company has now

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:39.000
until september 27th to present a plan that keeps world of warcraft traffic and that of

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:45.260
other games unthrottled so i guess that's good news for canada wish uh wish we had people

01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:51.080
that actually had power over here in the united states to do that kind of thing because internet

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:56.640
cable companies are running like crazy and pretty much have full power to throttle over

01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:01.120
the fuck they want well they got the smackdown so that's a good little follow-up to what

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:06.480
we were talking about last week hooray yeah all right i want to talk about this this is

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:11.440
uh also in foreign country news this is about australia and one of the retailers they are

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:19.560
game australia they have a new customer rewards card uh and it's kind of interesting because

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:27.160
what the hell is this you use your fingers in place of naughty bits for example imagine

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:31.800
there's a guy standing on the card looking down towards his crotch and there's a hole

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:36.600
there for you to put your finger through and you can make it a little winky or you could

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:42.640
put two fingers through as you could hear on this little card and have a butt clearly

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:47.300
this is all just to be provocative and i'm kind of surprised no one over here has tried

01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:52.600
this yet just getting people talking and so forth uh really that that's really all there

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:59.640
is to it it's just you know to you know look like a wiener and so forth however it is drawing

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:04.360
complaints of course not everybody likes this how dare you use two fingers to look like

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:09.360
a butt in the cutout of the card uh complaints have been filed with the accc that is the

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:14.540
australian competition and consumer commission game has not acknowledged or commented on

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:19.360
these complaints uh when questioned about these cards they just talk about how great

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:23.880
the reward programs is and all the stuff that they can get back we've decided to relaunch

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:27.800
the reward card program with its extra benefits blah blah blah blah blah and your finger's

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:33.720
a wiener no they haven't said anything about that of course i will say this there is that

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:38.480
kind of hidden you know undertone and that is when the major media reports on this it

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:46.440
just makes gamers look like a bunch of immature assholes of course you said ass and hole remember

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:53.160
the wiener is you all right a winner is you right now because right now we're going to

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:59.300
go through the gaming archives and find a classic game of the week every week dark sakura

01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:03.760
dives into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks hey you kids need to

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:09.440
show this game more respect screw the vita and screw the 3ds back in my day this game

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:17.760
was the bee's knees dark sakura i can make better boobs in chat than kevin68 can seriously

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:23.120
that's right a lot better chat um the today's game is the sims

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:30.400
yes the sims the game that started it on while we're all playing that stupid game on facebook

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:38.000
um basically the sims is uh a game is this actual game noises sorry yes that's actual game noises

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.800
and they're playing in a fast four which is like the best one i can find okay but it's a

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:49.200
life simulation game pretty much it's um was uh designed by will wright which you know what else

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:56.880
he did sim city so basically you can control and spore you can control your little sim person or

01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:04.640
some people or sim family in their little lives and suburbs and so uh that's really the game but

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:11.040
it's on all kinds of expansion packs and stuff and now we're on the sims 3 which i've been playing

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:16.080
so basically the way that your sim let's just say that you've got one sim you may

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:22.240
name him you know bob the sim or something so they've got you've got npc's and you've got your

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:27.520
actual sim and your sim can interact with the npc's and get married you eventually will be able to

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:32.480
control the sim that they marry blah blah but you have different stages of life you can make an

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:38.960
you have an infant a child and an adult and that's just in the sims um babies will grow into children

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:44.240
and children and adults never age so that means that they can stay in their little lifespan

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:48.960
indefinitely but they can die from different stuff like burning to death drowning in a pool

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:53.200
starving dying from disease and the grim reaper will come and take them away but you have to win

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:59.120
against them in rock paper scissors um or you will actually die your sim will actually die and

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:04.880
stay dead and your tombstone will show up i like in sims 3 how you know if you kill a sim they'll

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:10.720
just start haunting the house it's pretty awesome anyway um you've got uh live mode which is uh

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:15.200
where you do all your you know your gameplay and then you have build and buy mode where build mode

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:22.320
is where you build your house you start off with 20 000 simoleons which is their uh uh money system

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:29.920
and you've got buy mode where you can buy house parts and do stuff so in your lives your sims do

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:34.880
have a little bit of free will they can you know autonomously do stuff you can control i think the

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:42.960
level of their free will and but basically you still have to make them pee you have to

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:46.880
make them find a job and pay their bills and work out and you know make babies and shit

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:55.120
but basically you go make a baby i thought it was funny um because this actually mentions

01:34:55.120 --> 01:35:00.480
that their system of needs follow maslow's hierarchy of needs in which the physiological

01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:08.080
needs must be satisfied before other needs can be attended to so you know they they'll piss it you

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:12.160
know they'll piss on the floor if you know you don't tell them to go to the bathroom or if like

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:17.280
you forget to build a toilet which i had a friend do or if they don't eat they'll die of starvation

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.880
so they're and their needs their physical needs are what govern their mood so the the more that

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:28.320
their needs are taken care of the better mood that they'll be in i've got needs or for example

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:33.680
if you're playing um the the sim social you know how you don't get inspired until all your needs

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:39.120
are in the green same diff then you'll be happy i'm thinking i'm done with sim social and i'm

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:45.680
gonna block it on facebook i don't like it i like my house i hate the spammy spam like it's getting

01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:51.120
bad yeah like there's a little do you need to put a feedback window where you can leave them

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:57.360
feedback about oh really not liking any of that so you might want to try to leave i got feedback

01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:07.040
block well anyway so basically it's kind of like an artificial life program if you look at it in

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:11.760
that respect and you can keep playing and playing and like i used to in the first things i used to

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.320
just kill people all the time and um my friend had a great everybody did that with the sims

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:20.720
at first you have to create creative death traps for your sims like it's just it's a way of getting

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:25.760
out stress well one of my friends actually had what she called the house of death and like it

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:30.560
was all kinds of ways that you know they could set themselves on fire and things and she had

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:38.640
a graveyard in front of the house it was it was julius house dan i'm sure you remember that um so

01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.440
basically um now if with your kids you can they can study at home and keep their grades up but

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.680
if they miss too many school days they are transported to a military academy indefinitely

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:54.960
and they can't um prepare food or earn money so basically they're useless children are useless

01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:03.840
so i mean basically your sims can fight with other sims they do stuff and they can actually be uh

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:10.000
locked into an undead state by keeping them from leaving the hot tub or the bed and so they'll like

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:17.360
keep interacting with other people but they won't be able to leave they can't even they don't they

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:24.000
don't die they're just undead so basically um in the first sims it actually did use a combination

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.200
of 2d and 3d the sims themselves are 3d but everything in it are pre-rendered so the game

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:40.880
clearly has been a success it uh sold more than 6.3 million copies worldwide and as of uh

01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:50.480
as of february 7 2005 had 16 million copies shipped worldwide and of course it's been highly

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:58.560
pirated and um the music in the game was done by jerry martin mark russo kirk r casey and dicks

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:02.960
bruce and these people have actually i think gone through and done all the other sim music so you

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:06.880
can actually buy soundtracks of all the sim music and it's got its own little unique perky little

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:13.360
style you know it's cute now this is the part that i am interested in in particular is simlish

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:20.640
which they wanted to avoid a way to um they wanted to avoid localization of spoken dialogue

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:25.440
so the best way for them to do it was to create a language now simlish can i play some of the songs

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:30.160
in simlish because they're really bad find find the lily allen one find the one for smile because

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:38.000
it was actually really cute and the video is adorable um is that it yes there's an elifertado

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:48.720
one by the way

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:52.400
this kind of reminds me of uh kids bop i don't know why the nelifertado was actually kind of cool

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:58.320
too baby language bop well the whole point was with simlish oh and didn't katie perry did yeah

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.640
i was gonna say here here's one for uh salacious pop who i know is a huge fan of this artist

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:10.480
it's funny that's why you hear when it hears the song if you play it backwards it's devil's speak

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:17.520
and that's why she's popular listen she's listen play it backwards she's saying that she killed

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:34.080
michael jackson to get that record but actually these little videos that they did for him were

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:40.240
really cute anyway anyway simlish is really a bunch of gibberish but um they were gonna actually

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:49.680
base it they created it by experimenting with ukrainian french and tagalog and he wanted to

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:56.400
base it off of navajo but instead just went for gibberish that sounds like the same inflections

01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:00.720
that you'd hear in everyday speech they really got those bitches to sing in a baby language

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:05.440
pretty much i was watching how did somebody convince katie perry that's a good idea

01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:14.080
cha-ching you like money bitch right here's some money there was a special about it um i watched

01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:18.080
like one of the behind the scenes for the sims 3 about them recording some of the songs in simlish

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.720
and basically they are just nonsensical things that fit the phrasing of the original song

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:28.480
and they're like you know it was kind of fun and you know it's kind of neat to see the sim version

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:33.920
of me and you know so like besides being paid i've seen a lot about the songs that i've seen

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:37.440
besides being paid i've seen a lot amounts of money you know they said it was fun they just

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:44.240
showed what the lyric sheet looked like and it was all me my moo my mama me horgy wow you know

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:52.080
whatever they say in sim simlish but um the different expansions were living large

01:40:52.720 --> 01:41:00.160
house party hot date vacation unleashed superstar superstar and making magic which was the last one

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:07.520
and then sims 2 came out and then we have sims 3 now and honestly i think sims 2 was kind of better

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:15.440
than sims 3 but i really like sims 3 except it's so fucking slow ah but now keep in mind there's

01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:22.480
also a ton of mods out there in fact i think maxis really doesn't give a shit about the modding

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:26.400
community i mean they've tried they say oh people want special stuff so they've got their own sim

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:31.760
store and everything now but really the modding community is just crazy and there's even like

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.320
special modding tools now for for like universe makers and they've released their own custom

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:42.800
universe maker and since too they had um custom build the fucking universe they had a custom sims

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:48.320
maker where you could try on skins and different things and really just do all kinds of neat stuff

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:55.040
to them and now like in sims 3 you can adjust their boob size there's there's um uh model

01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:59.600
modifiers built in like you could even change all kinds of features on their face and everything

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:04.640
but people have gone further and made boob modifiers and butt modifiers and hip modifiers and

01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:08.480
there's even um elven ear modifiers where you can give them a combination between

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:14.720
tulcan style elven ears and wow style elven ears or you can just get really huge dumbo ears so

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:23.680
it's just you can farm you can and now the first thing that i did whenever uh in sims 3 now

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:29.680
whenever i just you know met some random person and ended up marrying them like um they my sim

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.160
that was carrying around like a relationship with five girls and two dudes like for some time

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:39.040
finally ended up marrying some girl sim slut so it's finally ended up marrying some girl except

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:44.800
her model was like really crappy so you can actually go into uh um the the stylist mode

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.920
are you saying you bought your wife a ton of plastic surgery yes i did yes i did i made my

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:55.200
wife look not not because honestly the original sim faces and since they were really derpy

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.520
so and now there's all kinds of special skins and hairs and stuff that doesn't look too derpy

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:05.280
and but anyway the first sims is what started it all and i played a good bit of that and i played

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:09.360
a lot of sims 2 because sims 2 was the one where they figured out how to crack the animation code

01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:14.000
and started having dirty things like you could buy dildos and a rug that had like you know

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:19.600
butt sex animation and all kinds of stuff well this is a well-timed classic game of the week

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:25.520

01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:43.040

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:48.880
band this week heart-shaped box rape me well that's a family-friendly song all apologies and

01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:52.400
you know you're right are all coming out those are actually some really big nirvana songs so

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:58.560
that's that's pretty cool it's a celebration of the 20th anniversary of nirvana's nevermind album

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:03.840
although it's weird because none of those tracks were actually on nevermind but if i'm not mistaken

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:08.400
nevermind that whole album was already released into rock band some time ago maybe for the

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:14.080
15th or something i don't know they are doing pro guitar and bass upgrades for plenty of nirvana

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:19.280
songs including smells like teen spirit the live lithium and come as you are live all those are

01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:24.080
getting upgrades there's like actually like 10 songs getting upgrades so you can use all three

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:30.000
chords if you if you are a nirvana fan uh you're gonna have a happy week in rock band this week

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.200
uh i heard uh i heard dark soccer give a little squee at this next story uh if you are a fan of

01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:41.680
capcom fighters one of the missing ones is coming out on the playstation store cyberbots full metal

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:49.040
madness don't you know cyber bosses capcom's number one game really that's a quote from

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:54.880
uh puzzle fighter oh from devilot that's right all right there you go uh so anyway uh that is

01:49:54.880 --> 01:50:01.520
coming out on the uh playstation store is that coming out in america too or just just japan

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:06.320
well i imagine it'll probably come out in both time to hook up the saturn i think it's coming

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:09.760
out in the us as well so if you uh like your capcom fighters that's gonna be a pretty big

01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:15.520
deal it's not like they have a lot of japanese change in it uh tokyo game show produced from

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:22.080
square enix this music sampler it's the music sampler cd 2011 volume 6 it might have spoiled

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:28.000
some of the upcoming cd releases from squenix now you know there's going to be a final fantasy 13 2

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.040
soundtrack of the final fantasy type 0 soundtrack that's no surprise but the announced for the ds

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.800
bravely default yes that was a name of a ds game that was announced 3ds game uh that is getting a

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:43.840
soundtrack apparently as well as is theta rhythm which isn't really a surprise either uh however

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:49.520
there's some interesting arranged music that has uh tracks on the sampler cd piano collections

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:55.600
final fantasy one two three an el shaddai remix album called el shaddai and the astral's that's

01:50:55.600 --> 01:51:02.080
kind of interesting uh also uh i guess something called cafe sq which is supposed to be some type

01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:07.440
of musical tribute to second at tetsu the 20th anniversary of that as well so pretty interesting

01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:12.320
there that'll uh i guess we i think that's already being given out the sampler is being

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:16.560
given out at tokyo game show but the rest of those cds probably throughout the next couple quarters

01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:24.240
moving on dark sakura i was actually i misquoted the line is what you don't recognize me cyber

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:34.080
boss is kalcom's number one game anyway 50 points from griffin door by me portal is free very very

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:40.800
free on steam until september 20th but go get it now because it's steam and portal and it's free

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:47.040
and very short it makes me throw up next up knights of the old republic is going down to

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:52.320
three pounds 50 pence on steam this weekend actually it's a whole half price on all the

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:58.080
star wars games and the same goes for the u.s only in dollars and cents and uh so if you want

01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:05.680
to get your scrotor on go for it and just call it scrotor yes i did you're so mature i know right

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:13.200
batman arkham city will actually have another character in it deadshot ooh and he will be in

01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:18.880
there to take out a series of high value targets so batman has to protect them and also other

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:26.000
characters in there are uh rock steady and joker hugo strange two-faced harley quinn riddler

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:32.400
poison ivy mr free penguin and the calendar man that's it that arkham city game is looking to be

01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:39.440
pretty sweet i gotta say yes but rob a lot of fun what scrotor shut up all right uh definitely get

01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:43.520
the free portal i mean it's it's free it's just obviously a draw to get more people on steam i

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:47.360
think everybody already got this like two years ago when it was free before when it came out on

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:51.680
mac yeah when steam for mac came out then portal came out for free but if for whatever reason you

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.960
just you've been resistant to steam or and you didn't get it last time or if somehow you're like

01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:01.680
the one person that hasn't played portal yet you you really should just like try it like i'm not

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:06.000
just saying that it is a pretty fucking rad game it's really awesome it's super cool even if you

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.520
hate first-person shooters it's more of a puzzle game i don't like first-person shooters and i play

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:15.760
the hell out of portal 2 yeah yeah and portal 2 is so fucking good i know uh before we get back

01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.520
into some long form news i want to give a plug for this um i didn't talk about this at the

01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:23.440
beginning of the show because i wanted you know the people that really stick with the show into a

01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:27.600
uh who stick with it to really hear this um because you're gonna hear this on a lot of

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:31.760
podcasts over the next few weeks it's that time of year where the podcast awards are coming around

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:36.400
and i'm i'm always kind of on the fence about this like i don't like that it's like a gigantic

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:41.600
popularity contest it was a lot more fun the first year and i'm not just saying that because we won

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:45.680
although you know obviously that that helped uh but it was more about like independent

01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:50.800
shows then like it seriously seemed like all of the independent independent video game podcast

01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:55.920
that existed at the time this is a long time ago uh this is like six years ago were nominated that

01:53:55.920 --> 01:54:02.240
year um i don't think we've been nominated since and let's be real as much as i don't like that

01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:08.160
it's a popularity contest and you hear about this on every single show it is really good exposure

01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:14.080
for the show and kind of helps us stand out in a very crowded field of uh podcasts if we do get

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:19.120
nominated and possibly win i would really just i mean we've won before so it's cool as long as

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:23.680
some independent podcast wins i think that's really important and uh i don't want to see

01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:30.080
a bunch of corporate funded paid for commercialized podcasts get nominated so

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:36.000
i'm gonna just kind of bite the bullet and ask would you consider nominating orange lounge radio

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:42.080
for best gaming podcast it's www.podcastawards.com i believe nominations are open until like the

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.160
30th so not too much longer this is probably the only time you're going to hear us mention on the

01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:51.120
show please if you like the show it's free we don't shove commercials down your throat just

01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:55.920
help us get this exposure it's all we really ask head over to podcastawards.com and please consider

01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:02.800
nominating us for best gaming podcast um you can only nominate the show in like one category you

01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:08.080
maybe can do best produced as well yeah i'm not i i don't even have delusions that we would get

01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:14.320
nominated in those categories yeah right so i don't well somehow many years ago we got nominated for

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:19.760
best of life 365 best station well i know how we did it it's because our fans are awesome and

01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:26.320
because not a lot of life 365 stations had rabid fan bases like ours we may not have thousands of

01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:32.080
listeners we have loyal listeners and that is that is an awesome feeling above all else like

01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:37.040
even if we don't get nominated oh wells you know we still have you guys that turn up on sunday

01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:41.760
nights and then download our podcast every week that makes it worthwhile but i'm just gonna say

01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:47.680
if you like the show help us get the exposure get us the nomination we'll go to the stinking

01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:51.920
ceremony maybe adam curry will be there again dark soccer went to the first award ceremony

01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:56.000
what is it to that she has the award sitting up on the desk yeah 2005 podcast awards for

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.400
i'll put the picture up on to go addition with uh next to and you saw adam curry's hair right

01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:06.880
oh your mic just literally fell apart live on air that's why we're not going to get nominated folks

01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:13.600
yes he had he had um the rock star type hair you know like the bon jovi style hair you know where

01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:19.120
they did have really long bushy 80s hair and then got it cut into that 90s cut he had that

01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:24.720
uh and uh let's see oh brad from pod cultures in the chat saying i don't mess with the podcast

01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:29.280
awards we don't stand a chance well then i'll then i'll say go nominate pod culture for best

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:32.640
sci-fi is there like a sci-fi category there's got to be right there's got to be like a fandom

01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:37.280
or sci-fi category go dominate pod culture for that i would say nominate bobby but he would be

01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:42.000
he would be kind of competition so he would if he gets nominated we don't definitely vote for him

01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:48.480
uh no you know what nominate bobby for best produced because he's a one-man band and he works

01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:53.280
his ass off every week to do and he's juggling his whole little drum thing that he does with the

01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:59.200
football nfl with his show so nominate him for best produced we don't we just we just want people

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:02.960
more people to hear about our show because we can't afford to advertise in magazines and all

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:08.880
that good stuff so podcastwords.com nominate us for best gaming podcast nominate us only once

01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:15.040
it's uploading oh the award we won with unpun man awesome it would be it'd also be kind of neat like

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:19.280
i gotta say i'm not gonna lie be kind of neat to have won that award like in 2005 and then like if

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:26.800
we get nominated again if big if i don't think any other show maybe certainly no other gaming shows

01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:33.680
could claim that they've been nominated that many years apart yeah i don't know maybe what other

01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:37.600
shows from back then are still going i think video game news radio is probably the only one

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:41.600
i think they're still going i think they're still live or they're not live on all games they do the

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:46.640
tape thing on all games so maybe they they could get in there too which would be cool i'd be happy

01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:51.440
for them it's another indie show those guys work hard yeah so as long as an indie show wins at the

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:57.600
end of the day i'm happy but if freaking blank blank blank corporate website wins i'm not going

01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.240
to be happy so let's at least push some indie to the top okay i've said last year

01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:12.240
i think it was four player podcast which i think actually um i i see some of them on twitter so

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:16.640
they are an indie thing i think they're like a justin tv related thing they do a lot with that

01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:20.880
stuff which we used to do the video broadcast but they've taken it all to the next level i

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:25.520
think they were the ones that won last year so that that is definitely an indie show as well

01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:31.600
and and if they win it again good on them good for them all right let's move on though more

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:36.240
gaming news i don't want to talk about that anymore i've given it far too much time loki uh

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:43.360
yes um so let's talk about gamestop you know how they have their streaming service coming

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:49.440
um well we know that because the whole whole debacle with uh you know deus x and that kind

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:55.200
of stuff but uh there's a little bit more to that as well um they've announced that they're

01:58:55.200 --> 01:59:01.120
going to be doing some sort of uh android branded tablet or i guess there'll be an android tablet

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:06.160
that's gamestop branded that's going to be a pair to the dedicated controller peripheral that's

01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:12.240
going to be coming out later next year and the thought is that the device will support i guess

01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:20.320
mobile apps and the goals allow full streaming of release titles to the tablet kind of like on live

01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:27.360
or something like that very interesting and very unsettling creepy to me but yeah fine if you want

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:33.040
to release a tablet that's fine it's more power to you but at the same time the tablet market is

01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:41.680
pretty crowded so i'll pass thanks exactly that's that's pretty much what i have to say on that i

01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:51.120
just pass i i don't know i i think it's gonna be difficult for them to do that but they want to try

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:55.360
fine dart has to be in our chat room at chat.org saying you're not supposed to say the name of the

01:59:55.360 --> 02:00:05.760
company whatever you know you know how we feel all right uh moving on to some other gaming news

02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:10.160
or actually this isn't really gaming per se but it's certainly that uh gaming device that you use

02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:13.440
for gaming that's sitting in your living room that's soon going to be your entertainment device

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:18.720
if it's not already microsoft is launching a tv service for the xbox 360 this holiday season you

02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:24.000
kind of already knew that via e3 but it was confirmed by microsoft ceo steve balmer at a

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.120
financial analyst meeting that happened this past week microsoft is working with quote dozens or

02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:35.760
hundreds of additional video content suppliers how to dozens or hundreds what how does that even work

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:42.240
well whatever um xbox tv is going to use the connect it's going to use bing and all that stuff

02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:47.760
you know like you were seeing in that demo at e3 uh and uh yeah it's there's a big difference

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:52.080
between dozens and hundreds there is a big difference between dozens and hundreds there

02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:57.920
you know working with one or a million somewhere between that i guess it's probably hard because

02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:01.920
they don't have a lot confirmed right now but i wonder if this is like xbox's kind of way to take

02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:07.040
a jab at netflix while they're down which is interesting because netflix is a big it's weird

02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:12.320
because netflix is a big part of the 360 right now anyway but a lot of you know netflix has

02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:17.120
really had a hard past couple months and it's just going to get worse for them when they lose stars

02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:24.800
so yeah their stock is tumbling if microsoft pays out the anus to get all these agreements that

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:31.520
netflix is losing it could be the thing to have i don't know it's gonna be interesting so wonder

02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:38.720
if their service is really popular if they just drop netflix you never know it's possible so is

02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:45.840
there any interest in um um a microsoft tv network i'd check it out i mean if it's gonna be included

02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:51.200
as part of my gold subscription then sure hell yeah free tv i especially if they have on-demand

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:56.240
stuff even if it's commercials if i get it for free i'm fine i get limited cable now fucking

02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:01.440
fx i don't get that anymore because they're paying for limited cable and actually at my

02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:07.680
box as an error right now so i don't get any on demand whatsoever um so yeah i look forward to

02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:14.400
anything free i'll cancel cable again i would even just be happy if i could watch like shows

02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:20.000
that are on cbs just later when i want not have to go on to cbs.com but like watch it in hd on my tv

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.760
i would really like that like just being able to watch survivor like the next day because wednesday

02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:28.800
nights are raid nights so i can't watch survivor live shut up don't judge me uh cinderwolf is in

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:34.080
our chat room at chat.orangeandre.com a proud canadian because uh he's saying and canada gets

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:38.960
short changed again as we have been with the internet tv feature included within windows

02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:45.840
media center well hasn't this similar feature been out in like europe and britain specifically

02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:49.920
for some time like the sky tv arrangement or is this like is this even beyond that like this is

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:54.640
just a step further where microsoft is now like trying to be the cable provider they're going a

02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:59.120
little further because before like i've heard a bunch of things i've heard one they're talking

02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:04.800
about working with your own cable con like basically it would be like a portal to the

02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:10.320
on-demand content that you have with whatever cable provider they have um to that they are

02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:15.040
going to be the content provider for all that stuff i would prefer the latter because you know

02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:21.120
i if i want to watch on demand stuff i can just do it through my tv you know if if we're talking

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:26.800
about my cable provider if you know i i rather be microsoft's own content you know some original

02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:33.440
shows be nice or you know i or just one versus 100 coming back i'm never gonna let up on that

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:39.120
um but i think canada will probably get it eventually but you're you the way of thinking

02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:42.960
is probably right because there's a follow-up comment here cinderwolf says content will be

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:47.920
extremely changed and limited compared to us tv available online sadly he's probably right

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:52.000
is that canada will probably get it eventually so will mexico so we'll you know wherever else

02:03:52.000 --> 02:04:02.400
xbox does business yeah whatever you saw tech tv so stop bitching so i will swap you you can have

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:09.280
all the crappy content that we have here and i'll take tech tv that would you know it would be kind

02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:13.520
of cool if it would work the other way and we could get some canadian shows here like oh yeah

02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:18.160
they get because of the content laws up there they get a lot of localized versions of shows too like

02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:23.360
they have uh or they had so you think you can dance canada they had canadian idol and all that

02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:28.160
stuff i don't think they have a lot of these shows anymore and but uh i don't know it might be fun to

02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:33.360
watch like tech tv and stuff there's many countries that have their own version of the office so that

02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:39.360
would be kind of oh yeah yeah be fun all right anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:45.840

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:24.240
to talk about it so stuff my fu of the week goes to vagueness that's right vagueness i'm being vague

02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:28.320
i don't know how i feel about that rob that's right neither do i so let's get back into the

02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:33.280
show get some more news out we'll get the twitter topics and skype line coming very soon

02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:39.920
but first loki yeah we talked a little bit earlier part a about yeah developers bitching and moaning

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:47.600
about their games and how they're treated poor poor my 8 8.0 what'd you get at nine well there's

02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:54.240
a different person um bitching now quadratic dreams co-founder i'm not even trying to pronounce

02:08:54.240 --> 02:09:01.040
his name some french guy anyways uh he estimates that the studio lost between um five and ten

02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:08.800
million euro um due to second-hand sales um basically we sold today approximately two

02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:14.960
million units we know from the trophy system that probably three more than three million people uh

02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:20.640
bought the game and played it um a small level it's a million people playing the game without

02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:27.200
giving me one cent too fucking bad is what i say to that what about the rentals or friends loaning

02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:34.240
their copies to other friends or multiple psn accounts on the same playstation or you know

02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:40.960
too fucking bad is what i say i i don't care you know what that's that's a fact of any business out

02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:47.760
there there's going to be a second-hand market for it cars appliances electronics movies games

02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:54.960
furniture whatever you suck it up that's part of the economy is that there's going to be secondhand

02:09:54.960 --> 02:10:00.960
sales and if you try to prevent it no one's gonna buy your product first hand make an awesome game

02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:05.840
that people want to buy day one you know what i mean heavy rain although heavy rain is a pretty

02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:13.200
good game heavy rain is all right but it's you know people get how much replayability is there

02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:18.960
really with heavy rain i mean it's a pretty linear game once you're done the thing you know it's like

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:23.520
watching a movie i mean once you've seen it so many times unless you're a super fan of the movie

02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:30.000
you can probably get rid of it and be fine um you know and his other comment is all now uh are games

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.240
too expensive i've always said the games are probably too expensive so there's probably a

02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:39.200
right level here to find and we need to discuss this all together and try to find a way that i

02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:45.280
would i would say reconcile consumer expectations retail expectations but also the expectations of

02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:49.520
the publishers and developers who make this business uh worthwhile business

02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:58.000
but once again though i i don't feel bad for you that your game sold used too fucking bad

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:03.360
where all the other publishers bitching about secondhand sales you know from their games

02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:08.880
suck it up hey you know what you sold a couple million copies people are interested maybe that's

02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:13.680
better than most games do if you know if you have three million people play your game and you

02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:18.800
release a sequel maybe they'll those three million people will buy it new instead of buying it used

02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:23.520
but you know what there's always gonna be people buying your game used and i think that's a good

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:28.240
thing because at least they're buying your game or interested in your product and they may become

02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:33.760
fans of your publishing comp or your you know development house or whatever and let me see hey

02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:37.600
there's a game that i may be more interested in purchasing new and it's by this you know development

02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:46.480
house yeah maybe i'm gonna go buy it um but you know i i just this type of mind frame and stuff

02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:51.040
it just to me it seems like the next step is oh i'm gonna try to find a way to prevent the

02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:56.720
secondhand sales and then that's where we getting the whole other problems but it's not gonna go

02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:02.240
away all right well let's move on to a story about a game that maybe some folks would have bought

02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.720
new i know a lot of people bought it new over here or put out more dlc because then those people

02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:11.040
about you way to ruin my transition can buy the dlc i think there is dlc for heavy rain isn't it

02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:17.280
put more all right anyhow let's talk about uh rock band in japan i didn't know this that harmonix

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:22.880
was uh teaming up with q entertainment back in 2008 to actually put rock band out in japan but

02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:28.000
it didn't happen uh q entertainment actually walked away from it now apparently um harmonix

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.720
uh didn't end up ever putting the game out in japan uh they said that they were i guess there's

02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:36.160
been questions that have come up at tokyo game show this week and so forth because you know they

02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:42.240
did put out dance central which is uh also you know coming out in japan uh dance central too and

02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:45.280
in an interview this week they were saying that they were very much interested in bringing the

02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:50.160
experience to the japanese market but there were just some challenges a lot of it had to do with

02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:55.120
the fact that you know trying to get all those plastic peripherals to an island country i guess

02:12:55.120 --> 02:13:00.080
proved difficult just the fact that people have smaller homes and all that stuff of course i kind

02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:05.280
of go well what about like guitar hero and or excuse me uh guitar freaks and drum freaks and

02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:12.880
all that um harmonix i guess at one point was looking at arcades as a way to do it but they

02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:17.200
said that arcades are very very noisy and if you're trying to make something that's really a

02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:23.120
musical experience it uh and you've got 37 other arcade machines all turned up to full volume it

02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:30.400
kind of impairs the musicality of the experience um i don't know konami's done pretty well at least

02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:34.640
in the past didn't guitar you see i thought that rock band always had come out in japan but i guess

02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:38.960
not i guess it was guitar hero did guitar hero came out over there they got the exact same game

02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:43.120
we got you see here's the answer to that you know if it's louder you put more speakers in your

02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:47.840
cabinet that's it so it's louder that's right more louder

02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:54.960
there you go uh legend of zaku and chat says bullshit konami was trying to sue their ass

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:59.520
that's why i don't remember that wasn't the lawsuit lawsuit was never about harmonix wasn't

02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:06.640
about activision i think it was activision i don't remember it's all been so long ago now

02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:13.760
2008 that was like three years ago good lord all right uh dark soccer what do you got for us

02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:21.600

02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:59.600
oblivion edition there's also a skyrim video thrown in oh okay and it's not going to have

02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:05.440
the steelbook casing in europe but it will in the us i wonder if it's that same walkthrough video

02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:10.480
that hit youtube this past week for skyrim that was a pretty good video no idea but people like

02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:15.360
oblivion i didn't know that was in a steelbook case in the us i thought it was just re-released

02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:20.000
with to be coming out and it's the anniversary edition is coming out in the steelbook case

02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:26.080
in the u.s in the u.s but it's already come out in the u.s it came out back in july

02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:31.440
actually in the june maybe this is a new new one yeah fifth anniversary edition it was the fifth

02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:37.280
anniversary huh well it said it had the steelbook case in the u.s whatever um maybe it did i i

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:41.040
bought the game like five years ago i'm not gonna buy it again just because they threw in some extra

02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:48.160
shit well you get 10 bucks off uh skyrim if you buy the game too i mean if you haven't played it

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.640
you know that's good oh yeah if you've never played oblivion it's worth checking out it is i mean

02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:59.040
it's not like a job it's not fucking final fantasy it is not final fantasy but it is it's well way

02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:03.280
more fallout but i always say fallout is more oblivion i don't know it's just it's so different

02:16:03.280 --> 02:16:10.720
it's like that first person it plays much more like an older pc rpg like it's more ultima than

02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:15.760
it is final fantasy and that's that's still a stretch i don't know what else to say you can

02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:19.600
punch sheep in the face that's right you can punch sheep in the face that's what i'll say

02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:26.080
or let loki say for me you can join guilds and rob them blind all the fun stuff you can do in

02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:32.160
oblivion some folks in chat are like wow oblivion's that old yeah that's the same reaction i had i was

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:37.200
like shit i remember when that came out it was delayed from the original xbox launch supposed

02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:44.640
to be a launch title that didn't make it anyhow loki um grand theft auto it's a lot not a big

02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:51.920
surprise um big game series the um fourth expansion grand theft auto 4 surpassed 22 million units

02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:57.520
shipped and uh which brings the total for the entire franchise to 114 million units shipped

02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:06.960
since 1997 that's pretty amazing and uh apparently surpassed uh san andreas uh san andreas sold 21.5

02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:14.960
million units um and this of course 500 000 over that now we need our grand theft auto 5 announcement

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:23.120
anytime now please it'll be next year what causes i'm just let opening this wide up to you being a

02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:28.960
rampant fanboy but i don't care why is this game so popular why is the grand theft auto series

02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:36.160
do so well why is it like just such a huge important game in the industry it's basically

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:41.360
you know it's you know obviously it kind of came up with the whole sandbox gameplay basically

02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:46.480
people buy the gameplay because you can do whatever you want it you can drive around be

02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:53.360
a criminal and do all sorts of crazy stuff with cars um shooting people and then just you know

02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:58.960
recently with the psp and then the you know grand theft auto 4 and uh the episodes from

02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:04.960
liberty city and stuff you know the multiplayer has been pretty cool um not a lot of people play

02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:12.400
multiplayer anymore but uh actually still quite a you know good community one it first launched and

02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:18.880
stuff um but i mean it's just kind of going from there and you know they also have pretty good

02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:23.360
storylines they go along with everything and you know their own brand of kind of parody for

02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:29.280
everything so i think that's why they're pretty popular um sandress especially that was a great

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:34.960
game um and then of course the new one five is supposed to be kind of like at least taking place

02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:42.240
in sandrais again so that'll be freaking awesome all right well i got one more news story for you

02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:47.040
guys and then we're going to open up the skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username

02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:50.880
on skype is orange lounge radio but this is a very important story because i've been waiting like

02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:56.480
a year and a half maybe two years to report on this story and it's not that i'm like particularly

02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:03.280
the biggest fan of this game but uh this just takes me back and uh thanks to the australian

02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:11.520
classification board listing uh apparently an hd remake has been spotted of a certain racing game

02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:16.560
guess what racing game uh derby owners club

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:20.080
oh

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.240
that's right daytona usa

02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:38.080
and if it doesn't have this song in it fail absolutely do not purchase do not

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:43.520
purchase demand that the song be included you know that the lyrics are taken out for the

02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:51.600
um sega racing classic no it's still the music but do you at least get the the doo doo doo doo doo

02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:58.080
part yeah well that's the most important part right there i guess

02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:06.400
uh so we don't know when the release date is but uh clearly it looks like something that's probably

02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:10.400
going to come out for a xbox live arcade or playstation network something downloadable

02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:14.960
because there already was like a sega racing game earlier this year right yeah and and i know that

02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:20.480
there are no announcements and as far as i'm aware no plans whatsoever to bring this game to

02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:25.760
uh consoles or portable systems but if you do a carmen san diego game

02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:28.640
it's got to have the theme song from the game show i'm just saying

02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:37.200

world of warcraft video game where players can talk with each other according to the u.s attorney

02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:38.400
and threatened to kill herself if he broke off the relationship oh that's lovely you know what

come back to this after i want to feel the force i will you do not want to feel the force you want

02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:18.080
to feel this phone call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey it's cd thunder hey cd

02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:25.280
thunder what's on your mind buddy uh not much uh i want to wish low-key happy belated birthday

02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:31.760
thank you you're welcome um the two games i want to talk about tonight are driver san francisco

02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:37.200
and dead island ah some uh pretty new games that have a lot of people talking all right so tell us

02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:42.480
about uh we'll start with dead island what we'll start with dead island what do you want to say

02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:51.360
about dead island oh dead island uh it sort of reminds me of dead rising a little bit except uh

02:24:51.360 --> 02:25:01.520
you were and uh the uh except the weapons once you use them for a while they are become they become

02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:12.080
useful they become useless and then um it's almost like an rpg because you can upgrade things but uh

02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:18.640
it's pretty interesting but uh so like you might have a gun in dead island and heaven forbid you

02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:24.400
actually run out of bullets and you can't use that gun anymore pretty much oh my gosh that's jank all

02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:29.600
right well i guess it makes you force you to think outside the box a little bit i mean it does is the

02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:35.760
game itself as artsy as that first trailer that they put out for it was or was that just like a

02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:42.880
thing um it's uh when you say what do you mean when you say artsy you know how like that that

02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:48.240
trailer that they put out had that sad little song and it was all in slow motion it was very artsy

02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:52.640
like the way they did it but like the game at the end of the day is a zombie first person shooter

02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:57.360
right or is it like did they try to class it up a bit i don't know i don't know how to explain it

02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:02.800
well i didn't i didn't see the trailer but it's very colorful i mean it's set

02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:06.880
like a general jungle setting where you have all these different apartment and condos things

02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:14.480
well how does it compare to other zombie games is it as good or does it suck or what well i

02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:23.680
haven't actually played it but um it looks it looks really good but it um

02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:30.800
i think i might want to play it if i could so i just assumed that he played it that's all right

02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:34.160
that's right all right well what do you want to say about driver san francisco is it have you

02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:40.160
played driver san francisco or is this just like you want to it's uh like another one two thing

02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:44.080
all right why why do you want to play driver san francisco i've actually heard a lot of good

02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:47.680
things about driver san francisco especially the multiplayer which is interesting because

02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:53.360
the last driver game i remember playing was driver 3 which was lol lol

02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:57.920
ah that game was fun all right what do you want to say about driver san francisco

02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:04.560
um one of the things i really like about it is there's parts where you your body is floating

02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:09.200
above the city and you go into other vehicles and it like you take over another person's body

02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:14.640
pretty much and when you talk it it's actually the person talking but you're making them say

02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:19.360
whatever you want wasn't that yeah isn't that the whole thing about driver like you get to possess

02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:23.840
people like that's you kind of float from car to car and like you could like possess a cop car and

02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:28.720
all the cliff off a cliff off a cliff that's how you want to play yeah the real one there's a

02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:33.840
mission where you have to take possession of this guy and scare his driving instructor

02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:43.680
so he had to make his heartbeat go up to this a number of beats per second and uh he says stuff

02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:50.000
like oh if you stop doing this now take 20 off your next driving lessons which where there will

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:55.760
be a lot of uh kevin68 in our chat says driver san francisco is actually good well then why

02:27:55.760 --> 02:28:01.760
did they call it driver i'm just kidding well because you're a guy who's a cop who drives around

02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:07.920
doing these different things different missions so i think that's why it's called driver but

02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:11.760
okay because it's that same concept that's been around since because you can't get out of the car

02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:18.400
you're driving you're stuck in the car forever and so all right drive it off cliff and then well

02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:21.440
well cd thunder anything else you want to share our listeners tonight any other games you're

02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:28.320
looking forward to um there's one i'm really looking forward to that rise of nightmares

02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:33.600
why why rise of nightmares because it i like creepy games like house of the day i know that

02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:42.400
type of thing and uh so i'm thinking you're kind of a zombie fan yeah a little bit not completely

02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:51.600
all right and uh so i've only seen parts of it but it it's not actually that scary might scare

02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:58.400

downpour and how terrible it is uh-huh it got delayed to next year interesting won't make it

02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:40.240
for halloween no it's terrible well if that's what they got to do they gotta polish it up that's why

02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:44.560
it's going you know what that's probably a good thing then so all right let's get back to the

02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:49.600
that's probably a good thing then so i at least that's what i've heard uh i haven't seen the

02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:55.920
official move yet but yeah it's next year all right let me uh let me get to this uh avengers

preview i've been making dar sakura wait here for so long let's uh let's take a look at this here

02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:06.640
this is uh some of the avengers game that was cancelled so if this game looks cool to you like

02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:11.360
this whole like flying around us iron man guess what you're never gonna play it if you want to

02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:16.000
give us a call by the way 1877 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio it's

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:21.200
all first person yeah it'd probably make me throw up it looks pretty cool it might be fun to watch

02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:24.320
someone else unfortunately say he's probably gonna have a license for the avengers game and it'll be

02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:29.120
a crappy brawler beat him up like the other games have been actually i would really like for them to

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:33.920
do an avengers game like they did uh ultimate alliance that would be really fun because i love

02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:37.920
marvel ultimate alliance i do kind of like the way that they've done this where it's like you

02:30:37.920 --> 02:30:43.760
really become the superhero that's kind of kind of neat and you fight super scrolls i'm trying to

02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:47.920
see if there's any any other uh clips other than just the iron man there's hulk oh there's hulk

02:30:47.920 --> 02:30:52.720
yeah it's clear that's hulk that's kind of neat with captain america you see like the shield on

02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:57.200
one arm very cool thanks for sharing that with us tiger claw let's go to one more tweet from tiger

02:30:57.200 --> 02:31:03.920
claw at twitter.com slash olr and i think this is sadly the last tweet we got tonight uh but this is

02:31:03.920 --> 02:31:10.960
uh about a oh you guys will love this an unreal tournament three mod the what they've modded on

02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:17.200
this nyan cat that's right they saw this cat in unreal tournament hold on because we're getting

02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:20.160
another call but we'll come back to the nyan cat in a little bit first we got another call

02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:27.440
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's me hi me what would the listeners rather know you

02:31:27.440 --> 02:31:35.200
as oh whatever miklatau shane hi miklatau shane whatever what about shane latov yeah shane latov

02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:41.520
what'd you call in to talk about tonight shane latov um i called in to talk about how awesome

02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:48.240
neo wiz is and they released tap sonic this week on the iphone or ios and it's really really fun

02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:52.640
and yeah i forgot to talk about that game i downloaded that on iphone it's it's it's neat

02:31:52.640 --> 02:31:57.680
what neo wiz what else do they make because you said they're awesome dj max oh i didn't realize

02:31:57.680 --> 02:32:02.640
the same company they're partially responsible for that that's why you see a lot of dj max songs when

02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:10.240
you're actually playing taps on it where the free song is like the end song from dj max 2 i just

02:32:10.240 --> 02:32:15.680
thought it was because they were both korean games i don't know no that would be cool though if all

02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:22.560
the korean games got together and made it like some uber game like you like losing in dj max or

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:30.560
something awesome and pump it up i don't know sure sure um uh tell tell the listeners about

02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:35.200
this game a little bit for those have no idea what tap sonic is because it was a the game is free

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.440
to check out sort of there's there's microtransactions at the butt in the game right

02:32:39.440 --> 02:32:46.240
and you if you want to play like for real you have to use those microtransactions um because

02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:53.280
as i was unaware when you spend like if you were one of the first i think it was 1000 people that

02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:59.920
downloaded it you got 300 million points and use those music points to purchase songs or so i

02:32:59.920 --> 02:33:05.360
thought you actually use those music points to play songs and you do not get to keep those songs

02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:10.960
once you spend the money on them so every time you play a song you're spending points so it's

02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:16.800
awesome i go back later i can just get a preview because i'm not a point wow that's kind of shitty

02:33:16.800 --> 02:33:22.640
though i gotta say i don't like that but i noticed the free songs rotate cheaper what's that

02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:29.920
i said i'd be okay with it if it was cheaper i guess the korean version like our rates for

02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:35.520
song purchases are like four times what they are in korea so we're really getting screwed here

02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:39.360
that's a little ridiculous i can't recommend it past the free songs for that but it's worth to

02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:43.520
check out the free version for the free songs the free songs rotate that's one thing i noticed like

02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:48.080
i had a song show up the first day that i wanted to play again and it was and now it was a pay song

02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:52.960
and a different song had showed up instead so i think they rotate a little bit oh really yeah i

02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:56.800
haven't noticed that yet i've only seen the same free song go back in and look because one of the

02:33:56.800 --> 02:34:03.280
songs i played the first day was suddenly a pay song it was weird so um i'll probably do that but

02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:07.840
the game itself the game itself it's like it's kind of like beatmania with the or guitar hero

02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:12.160
with the falling notes and you have to tap on the bottom of the screen what i think is really cool

02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:17.680
for ios is that there's certain notes that you tap hold and drag which i thought was kind of neat

02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:25.520
it kind of looks like a sound voltex if if you're following konami games in a way because it's got

02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:33.920
that guitar hero hallway style notes falling at you and well yes that's really about it and it's

02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:39.440
musical uh so would you recommend people check out tap sonic or no it's too damn expensive even

02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:44.480
though it's free to at least know it promotes our songs awesome i would i would say download the

02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:49.920
free thing if you like it and you want to spend money on it go ahead it's not like you're paying

02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:55.760
30 bucks to play three songs or something like that if you buy the points you know you probably

02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:01.920
get a good week's worth of play time if you don't play it like for hours and hours and hours on end

02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:09.760
so it's not so bad all right well any other games you want to mention um i don't think so i don't

02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:15.360
remember i only called to talk about that since you failed to all right well my i'm sorry so just

02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:20.080

on your mind not too much i just you know thought i'd call in the first night i'm listening to the

02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:06.560
podcast and uh really loving it uh great job so far thank you very much appreciate it what's on

02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:10.080
your mind what do you think of the stories we've been talking about tonight oh the stories that

02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:14.400
have been great and i mean you know it's it's awesome you know kind of watching and listening

02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:20.480
to the conversation sort of moving uh from side to side top of the top and kind of going all over

02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:25.200
the place i find it's really laid back i'm really impressed and i'm really excited to be able to

02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:29.600
ask what the setup you guys have going on here well thank you so much well it's almost like he

02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:34.320
called just to inflate our egos tonight and i really appreciate that i already have a headache

02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:40.480
because my skull's not big enough to hold all of my ego well no it is and i think hopefully go

02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:45.840
ahead hopefully it's not gonna you know get too much larger than the studio this isn't a very big

02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:51.840
room um yeah i know right uh i think it's important to note if if folks have only ever

02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:55.840
listened to the podcast feed and never never joined us for a live show the chat room is a

02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:58.960
lot of fun and even on a night like tonight where it's kind of a smaller turnout in chat

02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:06.400
than it usually is stupid emmys yeah stupid emmys uh they the the top topic will sometimes be about

02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:10.720
the show but then it kind of goes into these related topics and lots of links and fun things

02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:16.000
to look at it's almost like its own little stumble upon or tumblr exactly it's kind of like a domino

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:22.960
effect of just sheer awesomeness absolutely in fact right now somebody is asking for the nyan cat

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:28.240
video so i said i would uh well relink that to me robin i'll put it on the tumblr because we're

02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:32.480
putting stuff on the tumblr now oh of course of course hold on so that people will visit our

02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:38.640
tumblr there you go all right you get both well what do you think about 3ds versus vita cinder

02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:42.320
wolf since that's one of the big topics we got into tonight are you a 3ds owner by chance

02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:47.760
uh actually i'm not an owner of the 3ds i've had the pleasure of playing with it a few times for

02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:53.760
uh you know colleagues co-workers down at the office uh really liking it um i do love the option

02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:59.440
of you know the intensity adjusting the intensity of the 3d feature uh just so just because it's

02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:04.480
accommodating to everybody you know the people that typically you know suffer from things like

02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:10.400
headaches or migraines with the 3d technology uh so nintendo definitely made a great choice in uh

02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:17.360
not in that intensity feature you can go from like super gigantic headache to just minor headache to

02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:23.600
like to like slurp even like i drink i was just saying to going from like migraine headaches to

02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:30.320
i drank a slurpy too fast headache you know that type of thing exactly so well what about the vita

02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:34.560
though because the vita's coming out pretty soon if you are i don't know if you're a psp owner or

02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:39.040
if you're into sony stuff what do you think about what sony's doing over there well i i don't know

02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:44.880
i well i i do like sony uh sony's hardware so and even sony's gaming repertoire but i'm not

02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:49.920
particularly a fan of uh their marketing mode i mean they tend to wait for the competition to see

02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:56.720
what they can improve on and that's always a great strategy but i find that uh because they're not

02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:02.400
trying to stay ahead uh in the push everything out first mode i think they're losing a lot of

02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:08.960
the possible potential fan base uh because you know what i mentioned earlier in the in the chat room

02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:15.760
was that sony waited for microsoft to launch their 360 console and now worldwide there have

02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:21.520
been more 360 consoles sold than the sony playstation 3's uh xbox seems to have that

02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:28.480
much wider game repertoire to kind of cater to sort of all game or all gamers uh of all ages

02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:36.320
except in japan teen and adults except in japan well yeah that i suppose that is kind of true

02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:44.880
but uh i i find that that you know comparing the 360 repertoire to the playstation um you know

02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:51.040
there really are maybe only five or six games uh so far i say for the ps3 for example i'm really

02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:56.160
interested in that i haven't had a chance to play yet uh but you know it seems like microsoft is

02:40:56.160 --> 02:41:02.880
hawking you know a new game every week that seemed to be catching my attention too um

02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:10.240
it'll be similar with the uh the vita all right well we'll see we'll see what kind of develops

02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:13.840
especially as we start to hear more about the north american launch because you know we've

02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:17.360
heard a lot about the japanese launch but just because certain games are coming out at launch

02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:21.120
over there doesn't mean the launch window games are going to be the same it's going to be very

02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:25.360
interesting to see what happens with that um let me ask you one other quick question since you are

02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:32.080
a first time caller of the show what was that sure oh okay um i always ask this of listeners

02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:36.560
this kind of helps me understand what what kind of a gamer our listeners are what would you say

02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:40.960
is your favorite video game of all time or if you're having trouble picking just one one of

02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:49.520
your favorite video games of all time um favorite game of all time right now uh it's an old game i

02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:55.520
think was released back in 1990 on the turbo graphics 16 console by nec it was called

02:41:55.520 --> 02:42:02.480
newtopia 2 um it was sort of nec in hunts and soft's attempt at a zelda killer uh the

02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:07.520
turbo graphics released a year before the super nintendo console um and it really has a lot of the

02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:13.920
traditional rpg elements in it like the old zelda games um you know great soundtrack too even more

02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:20.560
so than uh say the old zelda games and i don't know i just i find it fun a fun run right from

02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:25.200
start to finish uh you can do it in you know a handful of hours you know five six hours but it's

02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:29.600
just very addicting at fun i absolutely remember the newtopia series haven't you covered that on

02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:33.520
the show before dark sucker i could be wrong but i have indeed covered newtopia so yeah it's a good

02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:38.400
good uh good times so one of the one of the highlights of the turbo graphics 16 so you i

02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:42.720
think you brought up turbo graphics in chat earlier so you must have been a big big fan

02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:48.240
many years ago uh actually i did see growing up uh my family you know we didn't have the

02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:52.640
standard nintendo receiver nintendo console uh dad had the old calico vision and ataris and then

02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:57.920
we jumped right into the the turbo graphics uh moments for the deal so i kind of grew up playing

02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:02.400
a lot of that uh and actually had the pleasure of finding one in a flea market about three years ago

02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:12.480
so it's soaked up to the hdtv nice have you had a duo no i haven't actually i've wanted to

02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:17.440
find one but uh you know other costs and other bills kind of trumping that right now well i can

02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:21.280

02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:26.000
twitter but i'm being super nice tonight because this is another video and it's from tiger claw

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:32.640
and he usually sends good stuff so what the heck let's do this one it's a a mod that he sent us

02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:39.200
it's super pixel brothers i guess what is this it's a it's a playable super mario brothers

02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:47.840
but it's only 64 pixels i guess it's an eight by eight led board that does super mario brothers but

02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:53.440
i can't imagine this at all looks pretty like it's gotta be terrible let's see i want to see what

02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:59.520
this looks like here so i'm trying to load up the video in chat but it's it's um here we go there

02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:07.360
we go guys oh my gosh he's playing blocks and under certain blocks and i've actually made it

02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:12.080
random oh he's got a nice accent i'm gonna try this out five points whereas just normal blocks to get

02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:19.280
to now another feature i've added is five different colored blocks yeah so if i can

02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:24.240
explain to you guys i don't think it's literally the nintendo rom like but it looks like somebody

02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:31.760
made their own version of it on this like imagine like one of those old school led games where

02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:37.200
there's only so many places you can have a cutout and he's it's basically these colored lights and

02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:42.480
the little mario is like an orange square that kind of goes around and you can break blocks and

02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:47.680
jump on top of things i gotta say this is much more impressive than what i was thinking it was

02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:53.440
gonna look like and these levels are it's sad i recognize these levels based off of the real game

02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:59.520
it's been translated really well a website run by enl so that's i gotta say that's pretty cool

02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:06.400
yeah not bad so i guess uh dark sakura i got one more link for you okay so why don't you go uh

02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:11.360

02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:22.480
always like to check in with loki and dark soccer and see if they have any last minute stories

02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:30.480

02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:38.400
uh mega man nine it's all guitar and metal versions of the song so i believe that's free

02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:44.080
