00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,020
Today, September 18th, 2011, Nintendo reveals the future of the 3DS and its pink.

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,620
The PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch, and Sony adds a controversial new

3
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:31,620
section to the PSN terms of service.

4
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,580
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,660
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,760
My name is Rob Roberts and joining you live here on this September 18th, 2011 for episode

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,860
number 428 with my co-hosts, first off, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie

8
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,860
Summers.

9
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,360
We're also the show where every gamer has access to chicken.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,460
You can ask him if you want.

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,460
I see.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,460
Yes.

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,460
Dark Sakura's eating chicken.

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,320
Tech master Loki is in the house over here as well and he's eating chicken.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Yeah.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
And I am chickenless.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
But I do have-

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
You can have some chicken.

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,320
I do.

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
No, it's okay.

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,320
I actually don't really want chicken.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
I have a pumpkin spice frappuccino.

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
So I'm good.

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
I had a pumpkin spice latte.

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,660
I had one of those brunches that was so big, like I'm still full.

26
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,980
So I'm just like, I'm not even hungry.

27
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,980
It's weird.

28
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,980
I can't explain it.

29
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,980
Okay.

30
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,980
Anyhow.

31
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,580
By the way, I'm still laughing my ass off over that Cracked article.

32
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,340
Which was, what is this article you were reading about?

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,420
It was one of those little photo shop things where they do rejected book covers and one

34
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,740
of them was, it's okay to be a douchebag by Ayn Rand.

35
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,460
You know what's interesting about that website is they have really made, you know, I'm not

36
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,460
knocking it.

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,460
This is just what I've noticed about them.

38
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,660
An observation, if you will, they really seem to have made a name for themselves.

39
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,500
I always thought, wasn't Cracked like a magazine, like the answer to Mad Magazine like 20 years

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
ago?

41
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,500
I think so.

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
It was Mad Magazine Lite.

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Does that still exist?

44
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Mad Magazine.

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,500
I don't even know.

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,540
But now what I notice is that Cracked is on like dig in those websites all the time because

47
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,740
it's like they specialize in top 10 lists or something like that.

48
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,740
I think it's awesome.

49
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,460
That's all they do is like lists.

50
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,500
I'm going to do one for them.

51
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,020
Do they take user submitted articles?

52
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,100
They, well they do, but they also, the better, like the better that they are, like they'll

53
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,980
start paying you for them or something.

54
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,980
There you go.

55
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,980
Okay, cool.

56
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,980
New industry for you.

57
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,480
Hey, I want you to join our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

58
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,920
We do tape our show live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,060
live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

60
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,760
Although to be fair, Bobby had the night off tonight, but nevermind if you're listening

61
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,300
on the podcast and you've never heard a live show before, he'll be back next week.

62
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,380
So again, if you are listening to us live at All Games Radio though, join us in the

63
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,380
chat room.

64
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,140
Again, that's chat.orangelaungeradio.com where we do often read comments from chat tonight,

65
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,660
which actually I got to admit, chats a little more dead than I usually see it.

66
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,060
And I don't know if that's just, we didn't have a lead in tonight cause Bobby was off

67
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,140
or is it the Emmys?

68
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,880
Like is everybody off watching the Emmys?

69
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Like I know that's our competition.

70
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,600
We are always up against some stupid award show.

71
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,280
Like Sunday night is like the night to have an award show in Hollywood and et cetera.

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
And tonight it's the Emmys.

73
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
The shmemmys.

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,940
I don't know the Emmys or whatever.

75
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,620
I barely watch any TV.

76
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,020
I can't wait till it's over so I can see Kathy Griffin's roast of the Emmys.

77
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,500
Is that a thing she does now?

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,340
She's doing something now where she like bashes the Emmys when it's over.

79
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,100
Didn't she get all that hate mail one year cause she said something at the Emmys?

80
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,660
She said, Jesus has nothing to do with me winning this award.

81
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,660
Oh yeah, yeah.

82
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,660
Oh boy.

83
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,660
All right.

84
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,660
Crazy lady.

85
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,660
Uh, anyhow.

86
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,180
Uh, also speaking of Emmys, actually Emmys kind of had me thinking about like video game

87
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,660
television today and kind of like how, you know, I don't think we'll ever see a video

88
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,660
game show nominated for an Emmy, although I'm sure there's some type of technical award

89
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,660
or something.

90
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,780
Some has won, but what part of the shmemmys, what is it about video game TV?

91
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,660
Like why hasn't there really been a lot of good video game TV?

92
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,740
And I know, I know some folks out there are fans of X play and some folks might be fans

93
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,580
of attack of the show, although I don't know.

94
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,660
I don't even know if attack of the show is really like a gaming show anymore, more than

95
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,340
it is just like a testosterone filled young guys kind of show.

96
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,340
I don't know.

97
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,820
Like the last video game show I remember myself getting really excited about was Nick arcade.

98
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,540
Like that was an awesome or star K do you want to go like way back back in the eighties

99
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,000
like the video game game shows.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So I don't know.

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,220
Are there any video game TV shows you guys have ever been into or are into?

102
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:33,000
I was, um, I watched that one and I can never remember the name of it where, um, they would

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,020
send the team through this like labyrinth with, uh, these Velcro vests and they would

104
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,540
attach the prizes to their vest.

105
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,260
I vaguely remember that.

106
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,260
Yeah.

107
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,260
Yeah.

108
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,260
Yeah.

109
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,260
And it was on Saturday morning after my cartoons.

110
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,880
So I would watch it all the time and I was like, you can't stick a turbo graphics to

111
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,300
your front, put it on your back.

112
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,980
They were empty boxes.

113
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,340
Probably it was just props or something like that, but I needed to grab games and stuff

114
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,340
and it was pretty cool.

115
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,340
Yeah.

116
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,660
I know what you're talking about.

117
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,580
I can't remember the name of it was, um, that was like something like labyrinth or something.

118
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,940
But no, it wasn't that it was, it had this guy.

119
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,780
I'm sure somebody in chat was probably JD Ross.

120
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,400
He's in every goddamn eighties game show.

121
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,740
Do you know what he's done now?

122
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,740
Thank you.

123
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,740
Wikipedia.

124
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,740
Do you know what he does now?

125
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,740
The big show that he's a producer, right?

126
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,940
Yeah, he's a producer, but there's a really big show on TV that he, you can thank him

127
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,940
for.

128
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,420
The biggest loser is his thing.

129
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,220
Well, how appropriate for him.

130
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,180
There was another show that was on to that he will always be fun house to me.

131
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,180
I'm sorry.

132
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,180
Okay.

133
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,180
That's what it was fun.

134
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,180
No way.

135
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,180
It wasn't fun.

136
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,180
The fun house was like the double dare turned up to 11.

137
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,540
Um, but it was also, um, well you remember that, that show, what was it?

138
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,980
The quest of the kingdom or something that, but that's not one of the thing of, there's

139
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,140
another guy who had Brown hair, he'd always wear like a member's only jacket.

140
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,140
This was the eighties.

141
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,140
Is that John Davidson?

142
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,180
Wasn't he on Hollywood squares?

143
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,660
He sat in a chair that looked a lot like captain Kirk's chair.

144
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,180
And I remember the show very much because they did a big special on the Neo Geo and

145
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,940
about taking the cards and switching them out, you know, putting them in the machine,

146
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,320
saving your game and coming home and playing it at home.

147
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,780
And I, for the life of me, I cannot remember what the name of the show was.

148
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,740
Let me ask this question while you guys try to think of the show or while the chatters

149
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,300
that shout it out.

150
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,540
Why, why is it that video game, video power, why is it that video game television hasn't

151
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,540
really seemed to work?

152
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,200
And I mean, there, there has been a few exceptions, like, you know, I know some of you guys dig

153
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
X play.

154
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,140
I know there's that show on spike TV that gets to break a lot of exclusives.

155
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,300
The one that Jeff Keeley does, you know, there's been a few things here and there, but like,

156
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,580
you know, G4 TV was supposed to be all about video games, but you know, it didn't work

157
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,660
cause it went like this whole different direction where it's aimed towards young guys.

158
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,260
Like is it just that, you know, we're too busy wanting to play video games, then watch

159
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,440
people talk about it on the TV?

160
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,320
Like why doesn't it work?

161
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,080
It's because it's too niche of an audience and it's hard for them to convince people

162
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,040
to sponsor the shows or put advertisements on the show because they're not getting as

163
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,260
many views as normal, especially in nowadays, you know, it's kind of irrelevant to have

164
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,180
a video game show unless you can lock in those kinds of exclusive interviews and sneak peeks

165
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,920
and stuff like that, that you can't do on the internet because you know, internet's

166
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,700
faster than TV or print media and that's just the way it is unless they're breaking news.

167
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,700
That's kind of the way it goes.

168
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,140
I'm positive one of them was video power.

169
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,140
You know, we have a story coming up later tonight.

170
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,620
I'm not going to totally get into it now, but you know, one of the big consoles is launching

171
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,180
a TV related thing and we'll talk more about that later.

172
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,460
But that does kind of seem to be like the future, especially when we talk a lot about

173
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:54,620
like a video on demand and how huge Netflix and Hulu and all that stuff has been on PlayStation

174
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,380
as well as Xbox.

175
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,780
And do you think it's possible that as these consoles become more like entertainment devices,

176
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,380
like almost for some people may be replacing cable someday.

177
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,380
I don't know.

178
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,420
Do you think we'll see more gaming related content on those consoles?

179
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,340
Well, yeah, if it's on a console, I can imagine that they're going to try to put some gaming

180
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,740
related content on there.

181
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,980
They'll probably feel like infomercials more than anything like kind of like the, you know,

182
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,940
majors minute on Xbox 360 is as nice as that is.

183
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,940
Let's let's be real.

184
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,780
It's just a product awareness thing for for Microsoft, right?

185
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
Yeah.

186
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,820
Well, I'm trying to find there is an article I saw talking about some new video game shows

187
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,180
coming and it was by the guy that did like The Room or something like that.

188
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,860
Not Silent Hill The Room, but like actually like the horrible cult movie The Room.

189
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,860
Yes.

190
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
The horrible cult movie.

191
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
It's actually him.

192
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
Yeah.

193
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,860
And it looks so fucking terrible.

194
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,500
I can't remember what the parody or it's a joke or something.

195
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,300
I don't think it is all to take too seriously.

196
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,820
I am your something.

197
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Interesting.

198
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
I don't remember what it was.

199
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,380
It's just retarded for the record.

200
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,620
The show, both shows I was thinking of is actually the same show, but different seasons

201
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,820
of it.

202
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,660
It's video power, video power because it started off as like a tip show and then it became

203
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,660
a game show.

204
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
Oh yeah.

205
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,660
I remember that one.

206
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,660
Yeah.

207
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,660
It was like game show.

208
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,660
It had tips.

209
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

210
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
But no, it started off I think it's just tips.

211
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,660
Interesting.

212
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,660
And it was like 1990, 1991.

213
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,660
I thought it was earlier than that.

214
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
Yeah.

215
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
It was like in the mid 80s.

216
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
I'm going to double check.

217
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,660
I don't know.

218
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
Um, let's see.

219
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,660
What else do I want to say?

220
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,660
Oh, Oh, I know what I wanted to say about like television on the consoles and so forth.

221
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,700
Like this, this is still a sore point for me to this day.

222
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
1992.

223
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Wow.

224
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,700
Was it really?

225
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,940
In two different formats from 1990 through 92.

226
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,940
Gosh.

227
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,940
I'm, I'm with Dan in the other room.

228
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,340
I thought it was way earlier than that.

229
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,620
Of course Wikipedia is always right 100% of the time, right?

230
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,220
Directed by Stevie Piskoski.

231
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,300
I'm going to double check IMDB.

232
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,860
Um, let me, let me hit on this.

233
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,340
I want to mention this and that is, you know, one thing that I think would have made an

234
00:09:52,340 --> 00:10:00,420
awesome television show would have been, um, the one versus 100 on Xbox 360.

235
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,580
Like I really feel like Microsoft was sitting on a gold mine with that and they let it go.

236
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,500
And I don't know if it's because of licensing reasons or what have you, but man, I know

237
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,380
so many people that were so into that.

238
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,000
It's really weird that they let it go.

239
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,600
And it really made me think like, why hasn't like game show network tried to pick up like

240
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,380
an actual game show that runs through consoles or something?

241
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,380
I don't know.

242
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,380
All right.

243
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,380
I found it.

244
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,260
It's called the Tommy Wee Show and it's featuring Tommy Wiseau.

245
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:35,460
And basically it's supposed to be this weird, I don't know, uh, they're saying it's, it's

246
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,940
going to be, um, presented by Makima.

247
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:46,060
And it's basically, it follows him as he repeatedly gets abducted by different races of mysterious

248
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,060
aliens transported to distant planets where he's forced to test popular video games.

249
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,900
So it's, it's a terrible idea ripped off of Mystery Science Theater 3000 with this guy

250
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,460
that looks like he's the undertaker or something like that.

251
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,460
It's just ridiculous.

252
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,460
I don't know.

253
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,660
Hey, guess what?

254
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,660
No one care.

255
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,660
All right.

256
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,340
So the screen, like where the screen freezes, he looks like he's about to throw up or you

257
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,980
know, fall asleep or something or both.

258
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,300
It's wherever this, that guy is very strange.

259
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
Anyhow.

260
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,700
Um, yeah, so I'm, I'm a little upset that, that Microsoft kind of let that thing go,

261
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,780
but I guess it wasn't very profitable for them or whatever.

262
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,180
They're probably losing money on it, but I think they should still revisit it at some

263
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,180
point.

264
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,380
Oh, one other, uh, we'll get into our gaming weeks here in a minute, but one other like

265
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:37,020
game slash TV related thing that I can think of that I know is coming soon is the whole,

266
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,540
um, uh, sci-fi TV show that's supposed to be like tied into an MMO.

267
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,060
Like I can't, I just, it popped in my head.

268
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,660
It was something I think they had talked about at E3.

269
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,820
Do you remember anything about that?

270
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,820
Loki?

271
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
It was like some time.

272
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,820
I know what you're talking about, but I don't know what the hell it's called.

273
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,660
And nor do I care.

274
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,660
It's a sci-fi show.

275
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
I mean, come on.

276
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,820
Um, one game series that I actually watched while there was a bunch of old ones, you know,

277
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,140
back in the eighties and nineties and stuff, game shows, you know, for sure.

278
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:13,020
Um, but I watched, um, well X play when, um, or extended play back when it was, you know,

279
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,820
tech TV, I used to watch that all the time.

280
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,460
Um, even next play, I used to watch it when it was G4 tech TV.

281
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:27,060
Um, and then of course, Starrcade, which was, you know, rerun like hell on that network

282
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,900
before it started sucking, um, and they got rid of it.

283
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,460
Um, what was the other one that was, yeah, portal was kind of lame.

284
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,060
They had that on there.

285
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,820
Um, I just watched all the online reviews now.

286
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,500
It's called Dave, where you go running around in MMOs and they do mock you.

287
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,260
Wasn't that the one that Wil Wheaton hosted or was that?

288
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
No.

289
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,260
Oh.

290
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:56,300
I just really watch YouTube like, like the Angry Video Game Nerd and you know, uh, crap.

291
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,740
What's that other one that you watch?

292
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,740
Classic Game Room.

293
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Classic Game Room is pretty cool.

294
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
Maybe that's it.

295
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,660
Everybody's turning to YouTube now and amateur programming such as, uh, the show you're listening

296
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,060
to right now, although we're more radio than TV, but hey, we have a YouTube channel.

297
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,980
We just don't like really do anything with it.

298
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,220
There you go.

299
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,820
So I use mind of post pic, uh, videos of Shermy and, uh, my best friend's son.

300
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,820
Hmm.

301
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,220
I post grants that thought of related videos and one video that had an uploaded trailer.

302
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,300
So I can link it on a newsletter I was doing.

303
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,460
Funny enough, that trailer got more comments than most of my other videos I put on there

304
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,260
because it's some really crappy hunting game.

305
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,860
Hey, you know what?

306
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,860
I don't care if it sucks.

307
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,620
I had to put the trailer up there.

308
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,620
All right.

309
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,140
Tiger call mentioned, um, something about a Gun Stringer game that was put out by Troma.

310
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,340
You know what Troma did, right?

311
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Toxic Avenger movies.

312
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,060
I was gonna say they do all the like really campy B movie stuff, like Troma and Juliet

313
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,260
and stuff, right?

314
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,460
It's just, it's SARS.

315
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,460
What's his name from?

316
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,460
Troma.

317
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,460
Um, Lloyd McCoffin or Kaufman or whatever.

318
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,460
He's in there.

319
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,460
Um, yeah.

320
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,460
All right.

321
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:12,100
Let's stop trying to get into the stories that we make up for later on bastard.

322
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Let's move.

323
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,100
You listen, you don't control the show.

324
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
Okay.

325
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Now I don't care.

326
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,760
We don't, I don't think we're even talking about that tonight.

327
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Let's move on.

328
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
Let's talk about our gaming week.

329
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,860
So I always like to start off the show talking about what kind of games we've been playing

330
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,860
this week.

331
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,860
Dark soccer.

332
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
Wow.

333
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
Wow.

334
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,820
As in the worlds of Warcrafts.

335
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,820
Wow.

336
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,820
Nerd.

337
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,820
Wow.

338
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,820
You're a nerd and sound get a life and Sims.

339
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
I've been playing Sims three.

340
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
Okay.

341
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,780
And um, I played some tiny tower and of course these are all the same games I play, but I

342
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,220
like to make and I played as Espa galuda.

343
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,140
I can never say it as blue to two on my phone.

344
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,180
Did you check out radiant silver gun on X-Box yet?

345
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,380
That seems like something will be up your alley.

346
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:59,500
I know that came out this week got like, but don't you want to see the super Uber HD version

347
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
prettiness?

348
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I don't think that we got it yet.

349
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Now that I think about it.

350
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Yeah, that came.

351
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,820
I just, I was thinking to you when I saw that on X-Box live the other day, I was like, oh,

352
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,340
I want to play the crap out of that.

353
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,500
Well, I was actually going to sit down and play, um, some, uh, symphony of the night

354
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,300
today, but I've had a bad headache for most of the day.

355
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,060
Damn Dracula causing those migraines.

356
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,060
Yeah.

357
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,380
Damn him.

358
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,500
It is not by my hand that I was once again given my migraine.

359
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Loki.

360
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
How was your gaming week?

361
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Um, it was all right.

362
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,340
Didn't really play a whole lot of stuff.

363
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,500
Um, mainly just three things, uh, earth defense force, insect Armageddon, played lots of that.

364
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:42,540
Uh, I think I have my jet guy now almost level seven, um, and Grand Theft Auto, we went back

365
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,260
to Lawson Dam again cause they got, they got tired of getting punked in, um, Battle of

366
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,500
the Gay Tony, so now they're getting punked in Lawson Dam, so, you know, mixing it up

367
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,700
a bit, I guess.

368
00:15:53,700 --> 00:16:01,140
Um, and then I played Zelda on, um, virtual console on the 3DS, so I've been playing that

369
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,140
right now.

370
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:10,980
I'm on the fifth dungeon, and, um, it's, it's fun, um, you know, the virtual console stuff's

371
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,640
all right, but it does make you realize one thing, and I don't know if anyone's really

372
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:21,940
covered it before, I'm sure they have, um, but, man, that D-pad, I mean Nintendo is known

373
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,700
for pretty good D-pads, you know, especially with the NES and stuff like that, you know,

374
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:34,140
great D-pad, or, no, I think pretty flawlessly, but that D-pad on that 3DS is terrible, and

375
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:40,380
that, what do they call it now, the circle pad or whatever, not good either, so, it's

376
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,260
just kind of like, okay, which terrible control method do I want to use?

377
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:51,140
So I end up using the circle pad for most things, but it is not, not good at all, um,

378
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:57,740
aside from that, though, the emulation's good, it's just that D-pad is terrible, but no D-pad

379
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
look good?

380
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,740
The one on the Vita.

381
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,180
Yeah, there's a lot of neat looking things about the Vita, I gotta say, but I guess we'll

382
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,340
get into that a little later, because there's lots and lots of news about handhelds, it's

383
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,180
like, this is like handheld week, there's tons and tons of news about both, we'll get

384
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,180
into that a little later.

385
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,180
Is that it for your gaming week?

386
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,180
Sounds like it?

387
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,180
Yeah.

388
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,340
My favorite game of the week, um, was mostly uneventful, I played a lot of the same stuff

389
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,700
like WoW and so forth too, I had to really talk myself down from buying Magica on Steam

390
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,300
today, although the game looks kind of fun, I might still buy it when I get home, it's

391
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:33,360
like, only like 9 bucks for the Uber edition right now on Steam, or you can get like the

392
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,220
buy 4 copies of the game for 7 dollars, it's like, it's some obscene sale going on on Steam

393
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,420
right now, and man, I love and I hate Steam, you know what I mean?

394
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,300
Like I love that I'm getting so many games super cheap, I hate that I keep spending money

395
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,460
on games I'll play like once or twice and then it'll be all like, oh I gotta go back

396
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,460
to WoW.

397
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,060
As far as other games I've been playing, I've been playing more L.A. Noire on the consoles,

398
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,960
did a couple other cases and so forth, and found that I'm really horrible at the action

399
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,260
sequences and I'm so thankful that the developers decided to put in a way you could just skip

400
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,920
the action sequences, cause like I just wasn't getting it, like, let me put it this way,

401
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,220
at the end of one of the cases, you finally figure out who the suspect really is, and

402
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,260
the suspect just bolts, suspect starts running, and the suspect ends up running around the

403
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:24,180
corner and taking a hostage, and you have to shoot the suspect before he shoots the

404
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,820
hostage, and like literally that scene started and I was like, shit, I forgot what button

405
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,680
fires the gun, I'm like, is it R2 or was it L1?

406
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,980
So I'm like hitting all the buttons, and I don't know, I screwed up one time, then I

407
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,980
screwed up the other time because I thought disarming the suspect meant you shoot him

408
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,980
in the hand.

409
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,060
I thought you would shoot him in the hand, you shoot him in the leg, but no, I shot him

410
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,860
in the hand that was holding the gun, and by some miracle of God, he shot the hostage

411
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,300
anyway, so I don't know how that works.

412
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,900
So finally it was just like, do you want to skip this action sequence, and I was like

413
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,620
God yes, because the thing I like best about that game is going to look at the clues and

414
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,180
going to investigate the suspects, or excuse me, interrogate the suspects, and put that

415
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,180
all together.

416
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,180
And investigating.

417
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,420
It's kind of like, you know, like putting together the pieces of a logic puzzle or something,

418
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:16,660
and it's amazing how exhilarating or how frustrating it can be when you hit the button, like I

419
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,700
literally sit there, and it's like being on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and it's like,

420
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:29,020
your final answer is truth, and then it goes, doo doo doo, fuck, I knew the bitch was lying.

421
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,700
They just have a casual mode in there where you pull back a slingshot and launch a bird

422
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,660
at the guy.

423
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,040
But I gotta say, as far as Rockstar Game goes, I don't usually get into the Grand Theft Auto

424
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,140
games and all that stuff, but I'm like, I'm really liking L.A. Noire.

425
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:50,180
I like the detective thing, and I'm all into the stories and the 40s stuff, so yeah, I'm

426
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,940
gonna play some more of that one.

427
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
It's really cool.

428
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,540
Some comments on Magica in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

429
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,300
And Fanell, I hope I said that right, says, Magica is crazy fun.

430
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,500
And Kaijuto says, Magica is crazy lag for me.

431
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,860
Make sure they fix that lag before you buy.

432
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,860
I wonder if that's for everybody or if it's like a system-related thing.

433
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,860
Interesting.

434
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,820
So yeah, I've been playing that.

435
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,980
Now, there's another game I've been playing quite a bit of this week, and I didn't know

436
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,780
if I wanted to talk about it on the show tonight, because I'm gonna kind of like open Pandora's

437
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,580
Box here by saying what I've been playing.

438
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,080
But I figure, what the hell, I'm not gonna be here the next two weeks anyway, so if any

439
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,140
hate mail comes in, I wouldn't see it anyway.

440
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,020
So if you've listened to this show for any length of time, I told you guys, I don't pirate

441
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
games.

442
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,540
I don't download a lot of games, I don't pirate games, except I have downloaded in the past,

443
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,900
like during the PlayStation 1 era, I downloaded a lot of the Bamani games.

444
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,660
Damn it, I was gonna bring you something.

445
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,460
I was gonna bring you President Cat.

446
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,580
I forgot both things.

447
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,580
That's different, that's different.

448
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,540
But I was gonna play the, or I used to back in the day, I would download the, cause I'm

449
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,540
not paying 80 bucks to import like all these games.

450
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,420
My mindset is, if you want my money, release the game in my territory, and I'll buy it.

451
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,940
So that being said, I've played quite a bit of Xenoblade Chronicles this week, and I'll

452
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,940
leave it at that.

453
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,860
I don't wanna talk a little bit about Xenoblade Chronicles, because it's interesting.

454
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,420
The game is very interesting.

455
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,820
First off, is the game a good game?

456
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
Yes.

457
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,420
Is it something the Wii needs on its system?

458
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,860
I think so.

459
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,940
But here's the honest reaction I had playing Xenoblade Chronicles.

460
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,460
The first thing out of my mouth, cause Salacious Pop, you know, I was sitting down playing

461
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,660
it for a couple hours, and Salacious Pop goes, well how was it?

462
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,540
And I said, you know what?

463
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,060
It feels like a really, really awesome PlayStation 2 game.

464
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,300
And that's kinda how I felt about it.

465
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,220
Is that the graphics, really not up to par with what you see on the 360 and the PlayStation

466
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,220
3.

467
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,220
It's understandable.

468
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,220
It's the Wii.

469
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,260
The game itself feels a lot like, I don't know, it's kinda like Final Fantasy XII, with

470
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:01,380
MMO elements, and a pretty neat battle system reminiscent of the other, you know, Xeno games.

471
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,100
So there's a lot to do in the game.

472
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,240
There's a lot of quests.

473
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,980
There's a lot of things you can do in the game, and the world is vast, and it's really

474
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,980
something else.

475
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,460
And if you're an RPG fan, you really have a right to be mad that they're not putting

476
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,700
the game out here.

477
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,700
And quite frankly, if they're not gonna put it out here, you should do what I did.

478
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,060
Don't miss out on a great game.

479
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,700
Sorry, I know I might get hate mail for encouraging that, but you know what?

480
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:32,460
I will happily buy this game when they release it in this country.

481
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,660
There you go.

482
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:39,020
Here's what I think might happen.

483
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:45,060
And this is maybe fan wank speculation, but if my honest reaction to the game was, you

484
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,020
know, this game needs to have, like, better graphics to really be competitive.

485
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,900
Maybe they're holding back and releasing it on the Wii U.

486
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,300
Because I could see this game really easily being adapted for the Wii U.

487
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,740
There's a lot, like the menu system, there's a lot to it, there's a lot of sub screens.

488
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,740
You could use that second device, or the little controller, very easily to do a lot of that,

489
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,960
and then you could have the really nice souped-up graphics.

490
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,500
And to be honest, if Nintendo, you know, maybe I'm giving them too much credit here, but

491
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,060
it would be a kick-ass launch title.

492
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,600
Especially in the, like, it would be a kick-ass launch title.

493
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,100
You don't usually see a lot of very vast RPGs as launch titles.

494
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,180
What did the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 have?

495
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,740
I think Enchanted Arms was like the only remote RPG available for like six months.

496
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,740
Oblivion?

497
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,740
Oh yeah.

498
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,420
But I'm thinking Japanese RPG, I'm not thinking, there's a big difference in my mind between

499
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:42,020
a game like Final Fantasy, Enchanted Arms, Xenoblade, and Oblivion.

500
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,580
Oblivion's its own thing.

501
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,420
But yeah, you're right, you're right, Oblivion is a pretty kick-ass RPG launch title.

502
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,420
I should have thought of that.

503
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,420
No, here's what they're gonna do.

504
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,420
Come on.

505
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,620
I mean, yeah, this is Nintendo, and yeah, I can see them doing that, because you know

506
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,620
what?

507
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,420
They have nothing to bring to the table right now for the Wii U.

508
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:04,300
They've got nothing, so they gotta, they can't hold back Zelda Skyward Sword any longer,

509
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,580
because people will just be really pissed off then.

510
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,140
But here's what they're gonna do.

511
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,980
All they're gonna do is they're gonna fucking upscale that shit.

512
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,740
They're not gonna redo the graphics.

513
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,380
They're gonna upscale the polygons, and you're gonna have low-res textures, you know, like

514
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,040
you've seen with the Metal Gear Solid HD collection.

515
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,940
There's different ways that they do HD.

516
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,060
Some of them, they'll actually go to the Microsoft, you know, Halo route or whatever, and you'll

517
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,620
see where it's redone in a whole new engine, but it's the same, you know, levels and that

518
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,100
kind of stuff, and everything's kind of redone in a new engine.

519
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,420
Or they go the route where, oh, we're just gonna up-res all the polygons, and the textures,

520
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,460
well they're just gonna look kind of fuzzy and smoothed out, but hey, you know what,

521
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,740
at least it's not all jaggy like it was, you know, in the older systems.

522
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,700
That's all they're gonna fucking do, and they're gonna maybe add some support for the Wii U

523
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,260
tablet thing, but you know what?

524
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,920
People will be like, oh my god, that's amazing, that's great!

525
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
But that's what they're doing.

526
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,820
They're holding out so that they go, lookit, we understand what the hardcore fan wants,

527
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,900
and we brought it to you with the Wii U, and you're supposed to go, oh my god, Nintendo,

528
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
my savior!

529
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,860
I'm gonna go buy your system now!

530
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,120
But you need to see through this shit, and you say, fuck them, they're just trying to

531
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,540
hold this little carrot in front of my nose, so I buy another fucking system that they

532
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,180
end up catering to the goddamn masses for, and make all these casual games, and completely

533
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,800
forget about the hardcore user that actually buys product for their damn system.

534
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,020
Here's the thing though, like, I agree and I don't, because the thing is, at the end

535
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:40,140
of the day, it's not just about the graphics, and the game itself is pretty freaking awesome,

536
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,740
especially, like if you like JRPGs at all, or you like these kind of like, you know,

537
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:50,500
very open world, do the side quests and battles in real time without going into cutscenes

538
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,020
for battle and all this, you know, the presentation of the game is great, and the game itself,

539
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,500
story and everything, is pretty awesome.

540
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,380
I don't think they need to do, I mean, the graphics do look dated, but even upresing

541
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,540
or whatever little tweaks they can make to it, that bring it a bump up, I think it's

542
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
okay.

543
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,340
Because at the end of the day, the game itself speaks for itself.

544
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,340
System's only as good as the games that are on it, buh buh buh buh buh, right?

545
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
So-

546
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,780
Well then if that's the way they want to go, they want to, you know, bring it out over

547
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,440
here, they need to bring it out on the Wii, like it is now, because it's done.

548
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,660
It can be put out now, and then they can do a special edition later on that has better

549
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,400
graphics or an HD version, and that'd come out like a year later.

550
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
What's the problem with that?

551
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,020
You get to sell it twice, and people may buy it twice.

552
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:38,540
The problem is, and I'm just being real with y'all here, the more Nintendo, I feel like

553
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:43,020
they're ignoring the type of game that I want to play, the more it makes me want to turn

554
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,740
to the dark side to do it.

555
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:50,860
And how easy was it to do when major gaming websites are posting, here's how to play Xenoblade

556
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,660
in the US, like Nintendo is just being fucking deaf.

557
00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:00,260
And that's fine if their ultimate grand scheme plan thing is to release it on the Wii U,

558
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,640
but I think they should have announced that by now.

559
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,580
And like, I would have waited to play this game.

560
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,660
If they'd announced it on the Wii U, I would have said, cool, it'll give me a launch game

561
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,300
that sounds like it'll be pretty kick-ass based on everything I've read online.

562
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,940
But seeing as I'm getting to this point where I'm like, you know what, this game is never

563
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:20,780
going to come out, and I really want to play it, so gosh, there's this ABC how to run these

564
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,540
games on my Wii right in front of my face, I'm doing it.

565
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,980
I want to play this game.

566
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,420
So be mad if you want, but I'm just being real.

567
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,360
I'm not the only one out there.

568
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,820
Or major gaming websites will not be publishing how to get away with it.

569
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,700
To be honest, it was just how to play the import copy of the game.

570
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:50,940
Well, yeah, no, and that's fine, and I understand that, but let's be real.

571
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,100
Let's be real.

572
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,020
You surely, you know, there's the thought of what you're really telling people, come

573
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,980
on, don't be, don't be ignorant, and I say that to everybody.

574
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,280
So it is what it is.

575
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,320
It's that, you know.

576
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,300
So will I buy the game if it comes out on Wii U?

577
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Probably.

578
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,300
But, I don't know.

579
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,780
It depends if we want to buy it on the Wii U.

580
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,340
Yeah, right now the question is, will I buy a Wii U, and I don't know.

581
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,660
Well, here's the thing with the Wii U.

582
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,580
I mean, look at some of the games that they're talking about coming out of the system.

583
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,380
There's like Batman Arkham City.

584
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,820
Why?

585
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,260
You're gonna release a game that's been out for a year now, you know, on that system?

586
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,780
I mean, who cares?

587
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,100
I just don't even see a point.

588
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,780
Release Skyward Sword on there then.

589
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,620
I mean, because no one's gonna fucking care because it's been out for a year.

590
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,140
I just, I don't know.

591
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:52,020
Right now they just don't have much to bring to the table for that, and I, I'd be surprised

592
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,500
if that system comes out next year.

593
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,300
All right, well we'll see.

594
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,540
All right, well that's it.

595
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,020
That's all I'm gonna say for my gaming week.

596
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,860
But yeah, Xenoblade Chronicles is a great game, and it's really too bad that Nintendo

597
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,860
won't release it here.

598
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,860
What else can I say?

599
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:11,300
So, all right, let's move on and get some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's

600
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
stories.

601
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,260
I will not be here for the next two weeks.

602
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,500
Yeah, two weeks.

603
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:21,620
I'm actually, after last week's show I realized, oh crap, I've got the concert next week and

604
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,380
then I actually have a scheduled trip to LA the week after that, and it's the one I do

605
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
every year.

606
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,100
So, yep, I'm taking a little break.

607
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Sorry guys.

608
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:35,740
But I believe the one and only Tiara is gonna be here covering, at least next week, if not

609
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
both weeks.

610
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
I don't know yet.

611
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
Just next week.

612
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
Just next week.

613
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,380
So, there will be some type of live shows, so tune in as always, and I'll miss you guys.

614
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,820
But at the same time, damn, we need vacations once in a while, give me a break.

615
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,940
Let's get into some gaming news.

616
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,940
Oh yeah.

617
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,940
Facebook.

618
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,940
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

619
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,260
Add us on Facebook please.

620
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
And Twitter.

621
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,460
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Now we can get into some gaming news.

622
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,940
We'll start it off with Loki.

623
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,700
I don't take vacations at all.

624
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:12,380
So Nintendo announced a lot of stuff at their pre-Toku game show press event.

625
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,820
Some of the stuff they announced, hey, you know those big games that you're waiting for

626
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,900
and ones that you may have purchased a system for?

627
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,660
Yeah, they're not coming this year.

628
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:26,980
Kid Icarus Uprising has been delayed to 2012, and that's for all regions.

629
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,500
And of course, you know, it's critically acclaimed, and yeah.

630
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Looks amazing.

631
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,380
You know, they had new video footage for it, but yeah, not coming out this year.

632
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,940
Too bad.

633
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:45,180
Of course, there's gonna be a new system update coming for the 3DS in November, and this is

634
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,860
gonna add 3D video capture as well.

635
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:55,260
And definitely kind of a cool thing, you know, because I know the 3D photos are pretty cool.

636
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,640
Yeah, actually that sounds all sorts of awesome.

637
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,340
Like I'm really all about the 3D video capture, but the only problem is the resolution on

638
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,020
those cameras is kind of shit.

639
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,740
That's terrible.

640
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,660
So that's kind of unfortunate.

641
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,860
Like if those cameras were just a slight better quality, it would be awesome, but you know

642
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:18,320
that next year when there's the 3DS Lite or the 3DS XL or whatever crap they come up with,

643
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,660
there's gonna be better cameras in it.

644
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,700
I'm sure that will help with the 3D, because let's be real, like not a lot of people have

645
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,500
3D cameras or 3D video cameras right now, so Nintendo could kind of get a jump on that,

646
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,860
you know, whole thing, the 3D craze by implementing that.

647
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,280
I'm really surprised it didn't have video at launch.

648
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,180
Not surprised at all that it's being patched in.

649
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,180
You're surprised?

650
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,620
The device didn't have all the features that they, you know, they talked about.

651
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,620
Oh yeah, eShop, you want to buy stuff?

652
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,380
Ehh, that's not coming for a few months.

653
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,380
Who's sharing?

654
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,940
Oh hey, you want to browse the internet?

655
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,820
Yeah, we didn't put the web browser in there, it wasn't quite done yet.

656
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,740
Ahh, Rush, no, we didn't rush the system, what are you talking about?

657
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,820
This was always planned like that.

658
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
Yeah.

659
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:09,100
So, November, because you know, they don't like the Rush things, they're taking their

660
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,100
time.

661
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:16,740
Of course, one of the things that came out was this god-awful ugly circle pad attachment

662
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:23,060
for Monster Hunter Tri-G, and of course, it's been announced that several titles will actually

663
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:30,660
support it, including Resident Evil Revelations, Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D, Ace Combat

664
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:37,900
3D, Dynasty Warriors Versus, and Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance.

665
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,180
And of course, this device is going to require an additional AAA battery to use because it's

666
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:49,340
got to communicate with the 3DS via the infrared port on the back, and it will also add a couple

667
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,540
extra shoulder buttons, and of course the circle pad.

668
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:58,620
Funny thing about the circle pad is, it's not needed for Monster Hunter.

669
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,300
In fact, all the demo kiosks at Tokyo Game Show didn't have it.

670
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,740
Interesting.

671
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,320
This thing is so interesting because, well A, the whole fact that it requires a separate

672
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,420
battery to run, like you could just hear the facepalming going on across Twitter and the

673
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,140
blogs and so forth when that was announced, so I'll just kind of let that speak for itself

674
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,860
and the whole, yeah, yeah, sure, they plan to do this the whole time, I'm really sure,

675
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,060
because they thought about adding that port on the back that could interface with this

676
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,700
and power it, but oops.

677
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,780
Of course, then again, you don't want anything else sucking the power out of the 3DS because

678
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,460
it's not like it holds a lot to begin with, right?

679
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,980
But it really is sounding more and more like this is the 3DS's version of MotionPlus, only

680
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,860
it's happening a lot faster.

681
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,180
And I really wonder how long it's gonna be before this thing is mandatory.

682
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:51,180
And you know on the remake next year, there's gonna be better cameras and the second analog

683
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,180
pad.

684
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,420
Look at that, second analog pad can go right there, nice little home for it right on the

685
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
device.

686
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,780
No, because the way it looks right now is just like a Wii U controller.

687
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:09,140
Yeah, but see, I believe that the buttons are, well actually, the buttons are above,

688
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,700
are below the thing, well fine, they'll move the buttons down and then they'll put the

689
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,700
circle pad there.

690
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:22,580
Hey, but they got you the BIOS system because they dropped the price, right?

691
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,900
Haha, suckers!

692
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,900
And then you'll buy it again!

693
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,980
That's what Nintendo likes to do, sell you hardware over and over and over again.

694
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,540
Remember Game Boy?

695
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:38,540
Coinora Chatroom at chat.orangelandrader.com, Randy says, that 3DS attachment makes the

696
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,380
thing look like a Game Gear.

697
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,380
A little bit.

698
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,140
I think the battery life might be a little better on a Game Gear though, not sure.

699
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,260
And then of course, you know, the best way to target your female audience is to put it

700
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,700
out in pink.

701
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:57,140
So they have a 3DS coming out in pink in October.

702
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:03,100
Yeah, uh, cool.

703
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,660
Not necessarily in the US.

704
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,380
Not in the US, in Japan only.

705
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,660
Are people really that shallow?

706
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,260
I mean, I understand people like pink things, but it's like, oh, I'm not buying that system.

707
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,260
Oh, it's in pink!

708
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,260
Oh, okay.

709
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,020
Yes, people are that shallow.

710
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,300
Just accept it and move on.

711
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,260
I shake my head at you guys.

712
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,100
See, this is how they get away with all that shit.

713
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,900
Put out a pink box for a game, huh?

714
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,380
Whenever blue systems come out, Megalotov's right there ready to buy one.

715
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,140
So I don't know what to tell you.

716
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
It's on, Dan.

717
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,140
What do you want to say?

718
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,140
Whoops.

719
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,140
Except it's muted.

720
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,140
Sorry about that.

721
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,140
Go ahead.

722
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,580
Pink systems, giant sellers at Christmas time.

723
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
Are they really?

724
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,580
Oh yeah.

725
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,060
You can't get the like the pink DS light.

726
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,540
You couldn't bag bar or steal one of those at Christmas time.

727
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,100
And the other time of the year, nobody fucking wanted them.

728
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Isn't it really?

729
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,380
Well, remember when I got my, um, uh, GBA?

730
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,740
Oh, dear God, no.

731
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,740
My pink GBA.

732
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
What about it?

733
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,700
And no one else could find them?

734
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,700
No.

735
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,700
But you know, it's not really just...

736
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,680
GBA, that was a long time ago.

737
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,060
It's not pink and hard to find.

738
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,980
It's not really just about the colors though, right?

739
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,900
Like, I don't know how many of you guys were watching the press conferences that was going

740
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,900
on, but they followed up this conversation on pink 3DSs with the girl tailored games,

741
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,280
which were, they looked really creepster to me.

742
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,340
Like I didn't get it, but of course, you know, it's a different culture, whatever.

743
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,900
Some comedian based game, I think was one of them.

744
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,180
They have a lot of girl based games already.

745
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,860
I mean, Ubisoft puts out a ton of girl games.

746
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,740
I mean, there is tons of DS games.

747
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:42,060
I want to preface by saying like tween girl games.

748
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:47,540
Like I don't want to infer, cause dark soccer might kick my butt, that girls like play different

749
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
games.

750
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,740
And like, you know, all girls hate Metroid and things like that.

751
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,080
But like, you know, the ones that are aimed at like the little girls, I'm going to punch

752
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,500
you with this microphone.

753
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,780
Although let's be real.

754
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,260
She did say she played a lot of Sims 3 this week.

755
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,180
I'm just kidding.

756
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,580
She's stuck on that Facebook Sims game.

757
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,340
A lot of people actually didn't touch it.

758
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,900
What a piece of crap.

759
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,900
Bullshit.

760
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,660
A lot of people are stuck on that Facebook game.

761
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,020
You lie like a rug.

762
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,220
I didn't play it at all yesterday.

763
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,540
So many of my Sims hated me.

764
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:29,900
But the DS, they did really try to market the DS at girls for a while.

765
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:35,520
Like didn't they have like Beyonce and Carrie Underwood doing commercials and Beyonce does

766
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,940
it then I've got to do that.

767
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,660
Girls and women were a huge marketing push with the Wii too.

768
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,980
Nintendo was just all about, you know, 40% of the consumers out there are 50% or 60%

769
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,980
or whatever are women.

770
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,100
And we're not marketing to them.

771
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,260
You've got to sell to women.

772
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,260
Sell, sell, sell.

773
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,900
Recommend games for girls, girls, girls, girls, sell, sell, sell.

774
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,460
I'm like, you fucking people.

775
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,260
Have you seen the customers that come into my store?

776
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,260
99% male.

777
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,580
If there's a girl in my store, they stay out until the girl leaves.

778
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,460
No, that's not true.

779
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,180
Well, it's often true.

780
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,060
It's because I don't know what to do around a woman.

781
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,060
If there's a girl in the store selling on the other hand, oh shit, unless she's the

782
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:20,260
world's worst salesperson, she could sell whatever it's because that's the only way

783
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,020
they'll ever see a woman in real life.

784
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,980
That's what I was saying.

785
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:29,780
But now they can see women in 3D on the 3DS in 3D, 3D boobies.

786
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,500
It's probably the first time they ever see 3D boobies.

787
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,500
All right, no, no, no, I kid.

788
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,700
So I don't know how many of you guys again watched Nintendo's conference.

789
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,820
Obviously there was a lot of focus on the monster hunter games that's coming out games

790
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:48,340
because there's tri-G and then there's four that they announced is going to be a Nintendo

791
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,980
3DS thing as well.

792
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,800
And then I got to say, I was totally thinking of Dark Sakura because after the press conference,

793
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,600
there was like 15 minutes of monster hunter commercials that featured Gachamon.

794
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,280
Like for 15 minutes, like all these little Gachamon ads for monster hunter games that

795
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
made me laugh.

796
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,860
Okay, I need this if there's Gachamon involved.

797
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,940
I watched them all thinking that that's when they were finally going to show that 3DS peripheral.

798
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:16,260
What was very interesting, that add on completely absent from Nintendo's press conference that

799
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,380
they did for not Tokyo game show.

800
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,780
I don't care about any of that.

801
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,660
You've lost me at Gachamon.

802
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,980
I'm totally being honest.

803
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,460
I should have like called you and it was on YouTube.

804
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,460
You might find them on YouTube.

805
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,460
You might.

806
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,460
They were all funny.

807
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:37,580
Now, uh, Kevin 6L8 in our chat room, maybe that's Kevin68 in our chat room says, uh,

808
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:43,500
in my store about a good third of the people buying our team to young adult girls buying

809
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
what buying?

810
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,940
I'm assuming like DS and related systems or maybe we are, of course.

811
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,940
Why not expo?

812
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,300
Yeah, that's, that's, that's the same thing.

813
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,460
I was watching our soccer.

814
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,660
She's, she brought it up.

815
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Just a preface.

816
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:02,080
I worked at a game crazy and I also worked at a store, you know, a few years ago back

817
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,420
before girls started playing games.

818
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,800
That's the scariest looking kate I've ever seen.

819
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,620
She didn't even pay attention.

820
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,660
Nobody cares.

821
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:16,020
It's a 70 show about a bird ninja team.

822
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,740
The science ninja team.

823
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,740
All right.

824
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,220
Uh, let's talk about the Vita a little bit cause there's a lot of news on the PlayStation

825
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,660
Vita as well.

826
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:30,940
Um, first off at their conference, they had this slide talking about 100 titles already

827
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,660
announced for the Vita.

828
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:39,100
Uh, things like a Ninja guidance, Sigma, ultimate moral, Marvel vs Capcom three, Katamari, DJ

829
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:45,780
max technica, um, the sound shapes game, super stardust, Delta wipeout Ridge racer, of course

830
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,780
always has to be there.

831
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:52,540
Zone of Enders, HD, metal gear, solid HD, uh, Gundam games, super robot, Tyson games,

832
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,700
tales of innocence, et cetera, et cetera.

833
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:00,140
So lots, I mean, it's very interesting watching the Sony conference because they are doing

834
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,400
everything they can to not fuck this up.

835
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,180
They and they are, they are trying to just punch Nintendo in the jugular.

836
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,440
And I'll tell you what, the delay of the Vita in the U S I'm telling you is so that the

837
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,240
lineup looks as strong here.

838
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,220
They are doing what everybody says Nintendo should have done.

839
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,940
And by, I mean, and everybody's saying Nintendo should not have launched a 3ds until Christmas.

840
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,220
And so what the Vita is doing is the Vita is waiting and it's building up an arsenal

841
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,220
of games.

842
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,460
So now when that thing launches here, it's going to come out with a bang.

843
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,260
It's it's really interesting.

844
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:35,700
It is actually, I mean, I wasn't too interested in, because before, you know, granted before

845
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,780
during E3, all they were showing was like, here's uncharted and then here's a bunch of

846
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,420
other crappy games that you don't give a shit about.

847
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,580
Oh, and wipe out for the, you know, the Vita I was like, eh, I don't really care for any

848
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,580
of that crap.

849
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,820
But now they're showing all the third party games for the Vita and it's looking nice,

850
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,820
right?

851
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,980
Uh, by the way, the Vita does come out December 17th, the date has been announced in Japan.

852
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,620
So it's very, they are cutting it really close there with the end of the year.

853
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,260
And uh, you know, that would be way too late here in America to make the holiday season.

854
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,780
I still think it would sell tons anyway, but I, I think Sony's doing the right thing by

855
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,640
waiting till next year because they're just going to dump a crap ton of games whenever

856
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
it launches here.

857
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,700
They did not announce the date here, although something to think about, it was reiterated

858
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,940
this week in on Twitter, in a Twitter conversation with, um, Sony computer entertainment president

859
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,100
of worldwide studios, Suhei Yoshida has reiterated the Vita is region free.

860
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,620
So if you want to import one of those fuckers on December 17th, you're good to go.

861
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,700
I'm getting the shakes already.

862
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,060
Giving Nintendo an unopposed holiday season is not smart.

863
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:46,300
They need to at least, I mean, I'm sure that before the holiday season really kicks in

864
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,500
that we'll at least know a date.

865
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,620
Uh, I, I do agree and they're not, but they're not going opposed in Japan, which is going

866
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,220
to be the biggest battleground I think of sorts.

867
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,220
I don't know.

868
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,060
I, I'm not too worried about the 3ds in, in the U S because I think, you know, the games

869
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,380
that they have coming out, they have, was it a super Mario 3d land and November and

870
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,620
that's really it.

871
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:15,620
And other than that, it's a Mario karts coming out in December, but later on and I don't

872
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,620
know.

873
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,940
So it's Mario definitely is a draw, but is it a system seller?

874
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,940
They're doing a smash brothers for that thing.

875
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,800
Yeah, yeah, they're doing a smash brothers for that thing.

876
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,460
And people are at some point in time, they have how many fucking people bought the Wii

877
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,260
because they put smash brothers on it.

878
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,260
I understand that.

879
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:38,020
And that's fine if they buy Nintendo needs to do is find that one fucking title.

880
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,180
That's what they've done with every system.

881
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,180
Every system.

882
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,380
People are just like, well, I don't know.

883
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,540
And then it comes out with that one title, which on the original DS was like Ninten dogs

884
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,540
or something.

885
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,220
And everybody goes, I got to have one of these fucking things.

886
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,620
So what fucking brain age?

887
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,620
Yeah, exactly.

888
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:59,220
What happens if at Christmas that one title comes out and Sony's just left holding their

889
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,340
sack?

890
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,540
They're not going to, I'm sorry.

891
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:05,940
It's it's not going to, first off smash brothers at E3, which they shouldn't have even really

892
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,940
announced at E3.

893
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,700
They're like, yeah, Hey, I'm thinking about working on a smash brothers game.

894
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,700
Is it in development?

895
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,700
No.

896
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,580
Is it coming out anytime soon?

897
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,580
No.

898
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,580
But, but we're thinking about it.

899
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,580
Yeah.

900
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,580
Just like we're thinking about doing a Pikmin game.

901
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,940
Where the fuck is your new Pikmin game that you promised us two years ago for the week?

902
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,700
Oh, that's never coming out.

903
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,940
So smash brothers for the three DS.

904
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,940
Yeah.

905
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,540
They promised you net two and you know, they promised that games coming out now, but two

906
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,220
years from now when it's like, um, Hey, where's the smash brothers game?

907
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,220
You promise us?

908
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,220
Yeah.

909
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,060
We're going to put it on the next three DS system that we're going to put out.

910
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,060
So, uh, sorry.

911
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:44,340
Three DS, I still think the internet as a whole, were you trying to say something Jamie?

912
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,340
Sorry.

913
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,340
Not anymore.

914
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,340
Okay.

915
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,540
I still think the internet as a whole is being a little hard on Nintendo because it's hard

916
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:56,620
on, he said hard on, but no, for real, because, and believe me, I have my issues with Nintendo

917
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:00,280
as well, but I think the three DS is going to sell bucket loads this Christmas.

918
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,100
I think a lot of people are seriously underestimating the power of that Mario cart and the Mario

919
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,340
land three D games.

920
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:10,740
I think that's going to sell a lot of systems this holiday, especially with there not being

921
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,740
a Vita.

922
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,740
Don't get me wrong.

923
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,340
The Vita is going to be an impressive thing and going to have a huge launch next year

924
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,900
that doesn't do anything for this Christmas here in the U S I just think those like Mario

925
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,460
cart, especially is huge.

926
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,220
I really think so.

927
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,660
I just think they need to bring up motion sickness pills with it.

928
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,740
I've gone through 10 holiday seasons and game retail.

929
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:40,180
No Nintendo system has been a shelf warmer at a Christmas time, except for the virtual

930
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,220
boy, but that was before my time.

931
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,220
Very true.

932
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,220
Very true.

933
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,620
I think the one thing that the three DS is lacking that Nintendo should have jumped on

934
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,100
sooner somehow second analog controller.

935
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,420
Uh, well that's a whole nother issue, but I'm just talking like, you know, format stuff

936
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,700
wise is the three D movies.

937
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,320
They were showing off a lot of the city three, the year that the three DS was shown.

938
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,820
You know, we have Netflix on the three DS, but yet we don't have three D movies yet.

939
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,640
Soon we're going to be able to record three D movies.

940
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,580
Now have you checked out the Nintendo video service that they've got on there?

941
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:16,180
Yeah, but what little five minute videos I'm talking when they, when we were 83 they were

942
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,520
talking about putting tangled in three D on a little cartridge.

943
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,500
They could, the lion King in three D was the number one movie at the box office this weekend

944
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,240
from 94 they put that thing on a three DS cart.

945
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,900
It's going to sell like crazy, you know, because it's so much cheaper right now and they need

946
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,500
to strike while the iron's hot.

947
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,180
It's so much cheaper right now to invest in the three DS is three D device, then go get

948
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:40,860
a fricking three D television and glasses, but that's not going to be the case much longer

949
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,260
come a year from now.

950
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,260
Next holiday.

951
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,420
I think three D three D TVs are going to be huge, man.

952
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,740
I can't wait.

953
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,900
Are you waiting to get a three DTV?

954
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:54,700
I want a three DTV because kind of like Matt, I'm a sucker for technology, but at the same

955
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,300
time as I've gotten older, I've gotten cheaper.

956
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,980
So I'm just like, Oh man, I am not going to spend $3,000 on that.

957
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,500
Especially as fast as technology is getting better and better.

958
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:11,400
You're definitely in a better position to wait because as soon as you buy one, it's

959
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,460
just like, Oh, Hey look, we came up with this technology that's even 10 times better and

960
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,460
it's cheaper.

961
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,460
It's like, Oh, come on.

962
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,560
Well, when I even, you know, I haven't waited and waited and waited about my 120 Hertz TV

963
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,180
because 120 Hertz was supposed to be the three D rate.

964
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,620
It's like on this TV now we can do three D when the three D comes out.

965
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,620
This TV will work.

966
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,620
I'm like, great.

967
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,620
Now.

968
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,620
Fuck you.

969
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,620
It's gotta be two 40.

970
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,620
Fuck you guys.

971
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,740
Fuck you right in the ear.

972
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,960
But that's okay.

973
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,480
Going to our chat at chat.orangestonsready.com hit stun says Netflix is in three D right?

974
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,960
Actually it's not, not on the three DS.

975
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,860
I know you would think it would be, but outside of the title screen and I think the menus,

976
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,260
the content itself, not in three D yet.

977
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,260
Who knows?

978
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,260
Who knows what might happen?

979
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,600
Uh, and then, uh, Kevin six eight in our chat at chat.orangestonsready.com says, I'm not

980
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,100
really into three D. I mean, it's more of a novelty to me.

981
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,400
See, I'm kind of there too.

982
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,580
And I feel a little weird talking about like hyping up three D and everything, but I think

983
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:05,840
for games three D might actually kind of be neat.

984
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,140
Like I got to admit some of the three DS stuff's got cool.

985
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:14,900
Like it's a little bitty screen and so forth, but it is, it's, it's, it's neat at least

986
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,900
for a little while.

987
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,560
I think the Mario Kart game is going to be kind of neat, but I think there probably will

988
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,280
be a point where I'm like, okay, let's, let's turn the three off now.

989
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,300
See with Mario Kart, it's just, it's a perfect example of what Nintendo does wrong and Mario

990
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:32,980
Kart, what they've done is every game only sells like 11 D gajillion copies.

991
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,220
I understand that because people are suckers and they're like, Oh, it's a Mario game.

992
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,460
I want to buy it.

993
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,460
Fine.

994
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,460
That's not why it happens.

995
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,500
It's because the Mario Kart games are good.

996
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,500
Really?

997
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,340
They're not creative.

998
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:51,780
They're not innovative, but they're always super fun and anyone can play them and they

999
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,060
just, they just last.

1000
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:58,700
The one series that Nintendo really doesn't need to do anything to, you know how, you

1001
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,580
know, they put out stuff and don't really do anything like animal crossing.

1002
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,100
They change absolutely nothing and they put out the new game on another system and Hey,

1003
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,980
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1004
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,620
In the new animal crossing, you will get to sit on a bench and swim.

1005
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,620
But that's fine.

1006
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,620
Okay.

1007
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,620
Two things.

1008
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,660
Um, and it's in a different camera perspective, whoopty shit.

1009
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,180
Um, but one of the series that they don't really need to do anything to is Mario Kart.

1010
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,980
I mean, Mario Kart was always good as it was hang gliders.

1011
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:24,980
Yeah.

1012
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,980
Hang gliders.

1013
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:26,980
That's awesome.

1014
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:32,780
Um, or you know, they've ruined battle mode, you know, after the 64 versions after the

1015
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,780
first one.

1016
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,300
No, it was, it was good.

1017
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,060
A 64 version was still fun.

1018
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,780
Good on like that flat out with seven battle screen.

1019
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,100
It was so cool.

1020
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:46,140
It was, Mario Kart 64 is an awesome game that I haven't spent enough time with.

1021
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,740
So it was blocked for, it was awesome in Mario Kart 64.

1022
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,740
I mean, that's where it was at, but you know, now they're just, they're trying too hard,

1023
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,740
I guess.

1024
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,980
Cause with Double Dash it was like, oh look, you can have a partner, you can switch back

1025
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,980
and forth.

1026
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,980
No, that was terrible.

1027
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:05,980
And then now, and then now they have like, oh look, hey, uh, we're going to have motorcycles

1028
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,300
and monster trucks and hang gliders and underwater sub things.

1029
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,300
Who gives a shit?

1030
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,300
It's a kart racing game.

1031
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:15,740
If you ever come over the one year that we put up like an eight player system like Mario

1032
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:16,740
Kart game.

1033
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,740
No.

1034
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,740
That was so great.

1035
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,780
It was like, I'm going to be controlling the rear guy and just punting people.

1036
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,420
It was like amazing.

1037
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,420
Let me, let me, let me try to kind of move on the conversation a little bit here, but,

1038
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,220
but Jamie, Jamie, I want to hear from you for a minute because Nintendo is targeting

1039
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,460
women.

1040
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,940
What do you think the 3DS's chances are this Christmas?

1041
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,780
It's going to be good cause it's an Nintendo system.

1042
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,280
I mean people buy Nintendo systems.

1043
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,280
That's really it.

1044
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,860
And people are going to buy the shit that comes out, like imagine babies and fart monsters

1045
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,860
or something.

1046
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,580
Do they have a game called fart monster 3D?

1047
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:56,980
No, they have, um, let's see what would be the closest thing to that.

1048
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,340
They have pet zombies.

1049
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,020
You can raise your own pet zombie.

1050
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,020
That's kind of fun.

1051
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,020
Shitting me.

1052
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,020
No.

1053
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,020
That's awesomely bad.

1054
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,020
All right.

1055
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,460
I would play that cause it's awesomely bad.

1056
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:10,780
Now we got to get back to some of this stuff on the Vita cause go ahead.

1057
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:15,300
I was going to say if they want to, you know, sell me one, just give me my Kid Icarus already.

1058
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,300
Soon.

1059
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,300
Next year.

1060
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,300
All right.

1061
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,980
Uh, by the way, cause some of the, uh, audio or excuse me, some of the chat is pointing

1062
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,700
out that Dan's audio is in and out.

1063
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,700
He's using the shit.

1064
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,940
He does have the busted mic right now cause I had to put a mic by the door so that Dan

1065
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,860
would come in here and yell random shit.

1066
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:35,980
He might be encouraged to pick up a mic and say it into the microphone, but unfortunately

1067
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,320
the only microphone we have is the half busted one.

1068
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,840
So I apologize to the shoddy audio quality.

1069
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,840
We hear that.

1070
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,840
Thank you Dan.

1071
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,840
No, actually now we can't.

1072
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,840
There you go.

1073
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,340
Just hold the cord.

1074
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,340
Yeah.

1075
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,340
You just have to do it.

1076
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,340
You have to kind of just kind of push it together.

1077
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,900
Like it's a falling apart.

1078
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,620
All right.

1079
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,620
More Vita news.

1080
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,260
My husband's a prevert.

1081
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:01,980
I mentioned this in the, uh, over overview of what all games are coming out, but I just

1082
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,140
kind of want to revisit.

1083
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:09,240
Uh, it was announced that zone of the enders HD collection and metal gear solid is coming

1084
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:16,540
to the Vita, uh, as well as Ninja Gaiden, ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three Katamari.

1085
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:21,100
And this was the huge bombshell that was dropped.

1086
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:27,300
Final fantasy 10 remake or HD version or whatever they're calling it is coming out.

1087
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,300
We're going to do a remake of final fantasy final fantasy 10.

1088
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,300
Yeah.

1089
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,360
They don't go with when everyone wants, they just go with one that all they have to do

1090
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,100
is update a few textures on and boom.

1091
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,340
Well I think you hit the nail on the head.

1092
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:43,100
There's far less work to be done with final fantasy 10 and they can get it done a lot

1093
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,100
faster.

1094
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,100
Not even updating the textures.

1095
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,100
It's just uprising.

1096
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,100
I don't know though.

1097
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,340
No, I've given that too much.

1098
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:54,920
Uh, I'm being too hard on them because the, you know, um, Ico shadow class collection

1099
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,920
is actually pretty good.

1100
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,460
So all this is a third part.

1101
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,460
Is that out?

1102
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:05,300
I need to get that out this it's either this week or next week.

1103
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,300
I got to get that.

1104
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,620
But anyways, no, actually I'm sorry.

1105
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,720
That is a third party company and so it's not Sony.

1106
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:16,220
So yeah, it's just going to be up res textures, um, and polygons.

1107
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:23,320
It's going to be Konami stuff or Konami quality, which there was a lot of like Twitter rage

1108
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,980
on seven fans versus 10 fans this week when the remake was announced.

1109
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,900
I noticed it was just kind of like the answer seems obvious to me.

1110
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,780
Ten's just an easier thing to remain in both games.

1111
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,700
Both games are equally popular in Japan.

1112
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:39,500
Well yeah, um, uprising into HD is a little different than remaking the whole damn game.

1113
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,680
You know, one is a lot easier to do than the other.

1114
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,340
So that's why you don't have a set because if you all press seven, it's going to look

1115
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,340
like shit.

1116
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,980
And I don't know why there's so many 10 haters.

1117
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:52,380
I don't know if it's because of like the whiny emo voice acting and stuff, but like Lulu

1118
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,940
is like one of the most bad-ass characters like in a video game.

1119
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,260
I really like 10 too.

1120
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,300
I really like 10 too.

1121
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,300
10 two's okay.

1122
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,700
I was like, yay, 10 too is fun and festive.

1123
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,380
Some days you want to have crazy hat day.

1124
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,380
It's the girl fest.

1125
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,740
I love it.

1126
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,980
So especially because there was like this whole area, like when you're on that long

1127
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:18,260
road that you could just cycle back through your dress fears and like level them all up

1128
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,980
super quickly, like over and over again if you had a couple hours to spend on it.

1129
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,700
Well who knows if Final Fantasy 10 sells well enough in a remake edition or what have you,

1130
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,700
they might have 10 too.

1131
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,580
Give us seven you whores.

1132
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:33,620
Here's my other question is, uh, and I don't know if you know this Loki, but some people

1133
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,220
are saying that this Final Fantasy 10 remake is not just for the Vita, that it's for the

1134
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:43,660
PlayStation three as well as that was, wow, that's, Kevin 68 makes a good point.

1135
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:44,660
What's that?

1136
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,660
Aaron was bad ass.

1137
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,660
Yes, he was.

1138
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,660
He was so bad ass.

1139
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,740
They put him in kingdom hearts as well.

1140
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,740
You know what?

1141
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,740
Hmm.

1142
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,700
He was like the only, cause you know, I leveled through the game so quickly.

1143
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,300
Well, I went through the game without leveling so quickly, but by the time I got to that

1144
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:05,220
last, uh, um, what was that fucker's name with the blue hair that started with a G.

1145
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,220
Ject?

1146
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,500
No, the bad guy with the blue hair that tried to marry Yuna.

1147
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,500
Oh, fuckwad.

1148
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,500
His name is fuckwad.

1149
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:17,480
By the time I got to fuckwad again, after the glyph mine battle, I was like dead and

1150
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,140
he was the only one that lived cause I didn't level, but he was a bad ass.

1151
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,800
Uh, tiger claw in our chat room says, what about that Final Fantasy musical game they

1152
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,800
are making?

1153
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,740
What is it on, it's, it's a three ds, not a Vita game, but it's that that's her river

1154
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,820
rhythm or whatever it was called.

1155
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,820
It looked dumb.

1156
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,620
Well, here's the thing.

1157
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:41,100
If the game was like $20 maybe, but $40, no thank you.

1158
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:45,800
Listen to last week's show and the whole price tag grant because I want, what are the Vita

1159
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,920
games going to be priced out of there all going to be 40 bucks to 50 shut the fuck up

1160
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,920
for real.

1161
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,820
Vita games are going to be 50 bucks.

1162
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:54,820
Hello.

1163
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,980
PSP games were fucking 50 bucks.

1164
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,260
Oh my God.

1165
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,260
I don't know.

1166
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,260
Apparently my head's been in the sand.

1167
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:05,460
I didn't buy a whole lot of PS 1540 it'll be a PSP price.

1168
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,460
I think.

1169
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,940
Um, I don't know, maybe 60.

1170
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:14,140
The only price I've seen so far is on, um, Lego Harry Potter.

1171
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,600
And that was, I think it was 50.

1172
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,540
It was Seymour Guado.

1173
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,540
That's right.

1174
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,540
It was Seymour.

1175
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,660
You want to see more Guado?

1176
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,460
I like fuck wad, Seymour fuck wad.

1177
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:29,940
Um, but yeah, that's the only one that, cause the only two titles that I actually have info

1178
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:36,180
on were, um, Lego Harry Potter two and um, dragon something.

1179
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,940
I don't remember the hell the other one was called.

1180
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,560
Like dragons, dragon dust or I don't know.

1181
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,660
Suddenly buying the Magica Uber edition for 10 bucks on steam doesn't seem like such a

1182
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:50,280
bad idea because like game pricing is so fucked up right now.

1183
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:57,180
Like I just, it's, we're in such this crazy state that we haven't been in gaming's history.

1184
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,580
Games have always kind of been around that same price, but now we've got 99 cent angry

1185
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,580
birds versus $50 Vita games.

1186
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,980
It's all about production value though.

1187
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:07,040
I mean, look at, look at the games that they're putting out now.

1188
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,040
What they have to do.

1189
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,540
They have, you know, Hollywood, um, voice actors and not all games have that, but they

1190
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:17,300
have, you know, teams of hundreds of people, you know, putting these things together for

1191
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:21,500
a long period of time versus angry birds, which could have been made by one or two guys

1192
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,500
in maybe a weekend.

1193
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:27,660
I mean, that's why that's 99 cents and that's why those games are 60 bucks because they

1194
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,460
also have to advertise.

1195
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,460
They have to do all that stuff.

1196
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:34,020
And yes, they can go the different route and try to do more casual stuff and stuff that

1197
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,020
costs less.

1198
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,180
But what about movies?

1199
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:40,340
Because like, you know, the Blair Witch project was made for what, like a nickel and then

1200
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:44,140
you had like Titanic and it costs the same to see both of those movies.

1201
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,260
Now I guess I understand now that with the 3D is throwing this interesting monkey wrench

1202
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:51,100
into it, you're not going to see independent 3D movies right now or right now anyway.

1203
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,100
Well, yes.

1204
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,500
So I understand that they're, you know, movies when they come to the theaters are all the

1205
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,420
same price, but that's, you know, up to the studios to make that decision whether they

1206
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,340
want to have a high budget movie or a low budget movie, you know, being put in there.

1207
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:06,540
And yeah, it's all gonna be the same price, but you know, they're charging these theaters

1208
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:11,620
a hell of a lot of money to put them in there and then they sell them on DVD and you know,

1209
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:17,580
yeah, DVD prices are, you know, it fluctuates depending on where you buy them, but it's

1210
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,400
because they've already had it out there and they've already made some money back from

1211
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,700
it already before they've gone and sold it on DVD or video on demand or however else

1212
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,740
you consume your entertainment.

1213
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:32,860
I guess it really just depends on what the quality of the game is, though, and how much

1214
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:33,860
you're into it.

1215
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,420
Like, and that's the interesting thing about Steam, too, is that it's kind of like one

1216
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,220
of those, well, once we've sold it to everybody, we think it's gonna buy it for 50 bucks, let's

1217
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,220
try to knock it down to 40.

1218
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,220
Like it's-

1219
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,220
Yeah.

1220
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,220
We can name that tune.

1221
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,220
Where I have-

1222
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,220
I'll buy that game for 50 bucks.

1223
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:49,220
But at the same time, though, I have a problem with a game that's terrible, that's being

1224
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:54,980
sold for $60 when it clearly looks like it's like an up-res PlayStation 2 game, or in the

1225
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:59,880
case of Activision and EA, where they put out Rock Band and Guitar Hero and they sell

1226
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:08,060
it for 60 bucks on the Wii, I mean, dude, it's less production quality for that version

1227
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,860
of the game than it was the other ones.

1228
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:14,340
Cinderwolf in our chatroom at chat.orangetowntrady.com says, as a retailer, the greater profit is

1229
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:22,260
in selling 200 copies at $30 rather than 50 copies at $50.

1230
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,260
Depends what you're talking about.

1231
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:27,700
I mean, if you're talking about games, there's no money to be made anywhere, but if you're

1232
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,740
talking about movies, then that's a different story.

1233
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,740
All right.

1234
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,520
Let's move on with some more news stories.

1235
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,260
We could talk all night about how games are really expensive, but at the end of the day,

1236
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:40,420
like seriously, if Civilization VI was announced and they were gonna charge a hundred bucks

1237
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:44,740
for it, I'd probably still pay it.

1238
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:45,740
It just really depends on the game.

1239
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,740
You're part of the problem, Rob.

1240
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:47,740
Yeah, I am.

1241
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,740
That's fine.

1242
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,740
Okay.

1243
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,620
Hey, some people spent 150 bucks on these limited edition, like Call of Duty's, World

1244
00:59:54,620 --> 01:00:01,780
of Warcraft's, Oblivion, or excuse me, Skyrim, you know, whatever game, so they make hundreds

1245
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,080
of bucks off people somehow.

1246
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,060
Some people imported games for a lot of money too.

1247
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,620
Yeah, who imported the game that came with a fucking dish?

1248
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,620
Dark Sakura.

1249
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,620
You know what?

1250
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:14,820
I didn't actually import that, I bought it in an import store and I didn't pay that much

1251
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,820
for it.

1252
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,180
Hey, are you a fan of Lord of the Rings?

1253
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,780
Because they've got a Lord of the Rings War of the North thing that's coming out, it comes

1254
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,980
in a quiver, a leather quiver.

1255
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,700
I remember you mentioning that.

1256
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,920
For the record, I am not a Lord of the Rings fan.

1257
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,920
The movies were okay.

1258
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,920
Are you a fan of leather quivers?

1259
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,920
No.

1260
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,960
The movies were okay and the books, the stories were great.

1261
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,780
The stories, but Tolkien's writing pisses me off.

1262
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:39,780
Are you a fan of guns?

1263
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,780
Yes.

1264
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,140
Because there's a Red Dead Redemption coming out with a six shooter.

1265
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,140
You want a gun?

1266
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,220
I want a gun!

1267
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,220
I just made that up.

1268
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,340
He totally made that up.

1269
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,740
We actually went looking at guns.

1270
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,380
I just want Dark Sakura to get excited about a gun.

1271
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,380
I want a gun.

1272
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,380
I don't want Dark Sakura to own a gun.

1273
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,380
Why?

1274
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,380
Because you'll shoot me!

1275
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,680
I won't.

1276
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,680
No I won't.

1277
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,780
Just because someone has a gun doesn't mean that they'll use a gun.

1278
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:08,540
Yeah but we're talking about you though.

1279
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:13,460
It would be safely in a locker and I would go outside to shoot it.

1280
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,460
You're right in the face.

1281
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:20,620
We're waiting until you get outside of the house so that way we can say you were a prowler.

1282
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:24,140
The next time Shermie shits on the floor she's gonna get it.

1283
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,140
No.

1284
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,740
Yeah she can absorb a bullet and be fine.

1285
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:27,740
She's right there.

1286
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:28,740
Bounce right off her.

1287
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:29,740
Be nice to the cat.

1288
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,740
I wouldn't shoot the cat.

1289
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,740
I like her better than anyone else in this room.

1290
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:39,460
As they put it in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, she's cultivating mass.

1291
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,180
She's cultivating sleep right now.

1292
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,180
Dark Sakura let's move on with some gaming news.

1293
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,740
Sony are bitches.

1294
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:46,740
Wait.

1295
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:51,460
They actually amended their online terms to block class action lawsuits.

1296
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:56,340
It's actually a section called binding individual arbitration.

1297
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:02,660
So to quote it says any dispute resolution proceedings whether in arbitration or court

1298
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:07,780
will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in the class or representative action

1299
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:12,820
as a named or unnamed member in the class consolidation representative or private attorney

1300
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,980
general action.

1301
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:20,300
So basically if you want to use our shit you can't sue us in the class action.

1302
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,900
But you can opt out.

1303
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:22,940
Yes you can opt out of it.

1304
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,780
You can send Sony a postcard or whatever and opt out of that.

1305
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,380
I want to make specially made postcards of Sony.

1306
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,260
That's a big middle finger.

1307
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,300
Opt out of this bitch.

1308
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,440
Well here's what it says.

1309
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,340
If you do not agree with the new terms of service or privacy policy or if you do not

1310
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:44,180
wish to enter into an agreement with Sony you may decline the TOS and privacy policy

1311
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:48,580
and we will close your account and return your funds.

1312
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,420
So in other words if you want to opt out then fuck off.

1313
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,900
You can't use our service at all.

1314
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,880
So it's not just a opt out because I want to sue you someday.

1315
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,380
You know the only reason I'm like whatever Sony is because the PlayStation Network is

1316
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,380
free.

1317
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:06,180
So it's kind of one of those you know whatever but at the same time there is PlayStation

1318
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,180
Plus.

1319
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,180
Go ahead.

1320
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:13,860
It says more actually says if the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable

1321
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:17,860
the entire section 15 will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court

1322
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,020
and you and the Sony entity you have a dispute with each agree to waive.

1323
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,460
In that instance to the fullest extent allowed by the law in a trial by jury.

1324
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,960
So in other words this may not actually be legal.

1325
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,300
And if it ends up being illegal then you never said anything but there is a court case of

1326
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,960
the AT&T that already set precedent that this is legal.

1327
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,960
So wow.

1328
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,660
You know not much you can do there.

1329
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,660
I don't know.

1330
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:41,660
That's just it does seem a little bit.

1331
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,660
Here's here's the thing.

1332
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,100
What am I actually going to sue Sony.

1333
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,460
I mean what are they going to do to me.

1334
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,380
That's really going to have me sue them.

1335
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,380
Nothing.

1336
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,360
I mean you know my cause I see them individually.

1337
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,760
I'm still waiting on your own.

1338
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,940
I'm still waiting for money back from Microsoft.

1339
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,220
I'm more likely to sue them before I sue Sony.

1340
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:01,540
Well it's basically saying you're sorry.

1341
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,540
Go ahead.

1342
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,540
Go ahead.

1343
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,540
I was going to say.

1344
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:08,540
But you'll be suing on an individual basis and not as a class action through Microsoft

1345
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:12,260
has nothing to do with Sony true.

1346
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:15,480
That's the whole point is like you can hire an attorney and you can spend all the money

1347
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:21,020
to sue them on your own and get you know maybe 15000.

1348
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:26,060
I'm just using an arbitrary figure 15000 dollars were as opposed to a class action lawsuit

1349
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:32,420
with maybe a million users and each of them get five dollars that's five million bucks.

1350
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,660
You know think about that.

1351
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:40,820
It's it's a way to basically save their assets not assets assets and also because they're

1352
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:44,780
a bigger company and they have money to throw at this type of stuff they can just drag it

1353
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,420
out forever until you run out of money to fight it right.

1354
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:50,700
It's kind of an intimidation thing it's kind of one of those where bigger than you are

1355
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:58,100
so you can sue us and we'll just get scary scary station network but well you may not

1356
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:03,060
use PlayStation Network but as Loki said AT&T set a precedent for this so maybe Sony setting

1357
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:06,500
a precedent for this in the gaming world and by the time the Wii U comes out with its online

1358
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:15,940
service it'll have something like this as well and Xbox Live may adopt a similar policy

1359
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:21,640
when it does a little remodel this really needs to be because basically it's like they're

1360
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,340
trying to manipulate the court system.

1361
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:34,500
They should have no jurisdiction in determining how someone can legally challenge.

1362
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,980
I like this salacious pop is just rambling about this in our chat room so I want to read

1363
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:41,020
some of these comments here at chat dot orange on twitter dot com.

1364
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,300
That is embarrassingly dumb.

1365
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:45,660
The only reason why you'd ever need to be approached to be part of a class action and

1366
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:50,140
having that class action go to trial is because there's obviously clearly incompetent shit

1367
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:54,860
going on on a wide scale that is the point of a class action oh my god if you try to

1368
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:58,820
form a class action and you don't have a case and you're just a butt mad neckbeard you'll

1369
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:03,280
be laughed out of court class actions are the only real way you can make a company pay

1370
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:08,580
huge punitive damages as punishment for their shady dealings in an individual case if you're

1371
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:12,900
in the right yeah you'll get paid well but it won't be punitive damages kind of money

1372
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:20,580
so sony is trying to protect their wallet that's exactly it i like butt mad neckbeard

1373
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:25,580
makes me think of those guys that get up and ask questions at blizzcon well that's exactly

1374
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:30,880
it i mean that was pretty much the the point i was trying to make they're trying to save

1375
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,860
money and you know not basically have to take any responsibility for the shit that they're

1376
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:39,300
doing at the end of the day i don't really like it but i hit accept anyway because i

1377
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:45,260
wanted to like play my games online so well that's the problem what can you do that right

1378
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:50,300
there is the problem i mean not no offense or anything i'm not like pointing at you but

1379
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:55,460
that is that's why they they can get away with it because people will say oh i just

1380
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:00,040
want to play my games i don't give a shit but that's how they're going to get away with

1381
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,700
it but because there's going to be too many people what can you do what can you do how

1382
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:08,100
can you hold this company accountable like i i still believe like even though whatever

1383
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:13,700
at&t said a precedent if they fuck up on the scale of the network breach again i'm sorry

1384
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:19,540
this little passage 15 isn't going to hold up you know congress is investigating sony

1385
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:24,820
for their fuck up you know what i mean like if like you know they don't have a you know

1386
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:31,300
deficit or anything to worry about so i don't know it's just but the whole the whole point

1387
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:35,060
is that by sitting around and doing nothing they're going to get away with this as long

1388
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:39,100
as they can a lot of people are going to get serious internet rage dark soccer that is

1389
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:44,400
how we're responding with internet rage i am very upset at sony well there actually

1390
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,140
is a number of things you can do you can write your you know your representatives to you

1391
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:53,740
know double check the legality of this because uh clearly they're not going to you know they'd

1392
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,860
have to evaluate it on a state-by-state basis too to see if any of that's going to fly because

1393
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:04,060
they have to deal with state laws as well and they can't stand in the way of you know

1394
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:08,780
legal proceeding or you can send loki's card with the giant middle finger i'm trying to

1395
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:13,100
be serious i know i know the whole point is that it's something that should not be allowed

1396
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:20,820
to to pass uh marisa con gusto in our chat room says there is pending legislation about

1397
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:25,460
word salad legal agreements but this won't stop arbitration clauses which you are a part

1398
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:30,500
of in many areas that you don't even know of that's very true very common like cell

1399
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:35,040
phone agreements and just all sorts of anything you sign probably has some stupid arbitration

1400
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:42,060
clause in it this country that that that that that that that i'd be interested though how

1401
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:47,980
does sony protect themselves in other countries because if they were to screw up again that

1402
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:54,820
might hold a legal thing in the u.s but did they have to do the same thing in canada or

1403
01:08:54,820 --> 01:09:01,740
they'd probably do whatever the equivalent law is you know have something kind of interesting

1404
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:05,300
i don't know all right let's move on with some more gaming news we could talk about

1405
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:10,340
this all night but so final fantasy 10 the remake is not the only final fantasy that's

1406
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:15,820

1407
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:22,220

1412
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:54,380
be available and um i guess the game itself will feature time travel so that's kind of

1413
01:09:54,380 --> 01:10:03,100
neat um the game is launching uh next year on the north american region uh january 31st

1419
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:45,860
releasing like a whole new playstation though like i don't know it's just it's just a limited

01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:49,380
edition i mean whatever they did call dude wouldn't the final fantasy fans have already

1421
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:57,020
bought one for final fantasy 13 the original um yeah maybe i don't know um and of course

1422
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:02,500
as we said earlier uh final fantasy 10 the remake for playstation vita and playstation

1423
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:08,140
3 that'll be coming out later on my bad on that loki sorry that's all right no big deal

1424
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:12,100
we have to mention again because it's awesome it i it's something i'm gonna probably pick

1425
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:15,700
up no doubt no i would love to see what i mean obviously this won't happen till they

1426
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:22,540
kill off the playstation 2 version of it but uh an hd remake version of final fantasy 11

1427
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:26,260
that's free to play would be awesome i could happen didn't i talk about this a couple weeks

1428
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:29,740
ago on the show that they were investigating dumping the playstation 2 you yeah you did

1429
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:33,860
mention that but actually hasn't there been a rumor about 11 on the vita already i think

1430
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:37,820
there has yeah oh can you imagine if that game goes free to play i don't know what i'm

1431
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:44,660
gonna do the wife won't have a reason to stop you now well you know what see here's the

1432
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:47,860
thing though the only reason i didn't have i stopped my subscription because i don't

1433
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:53,460
get a lot of time to play so it may be like maybe an hour or two every few days but if

1434
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:58,940
it's free to play who gives a shit so i don't play for a few days or weeks or whatever i'm

1435
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:06,980
not paying for it let me go to this next story which is uh yeah this is this is interesting

1436
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:11,620
because this is about reviews uh and so we're gonna talk about game reviews for a little

1437
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:16,460
bit as you know gears of war 3 is on its way out and it's it's kind of a big deal like

1438
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:20,540
if you're into these types of shooter games at all it's kind of a big deal and the game's

1439
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:24,620
getting good reviews it's getting a lot of great reviews glowing reviews everywhere uh

1440
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:31,620
there was an article however with vg247.com that cliff basinski or cliffy b did talking

1441
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:36,500
about gears of war let me read the little passage of the interview here were you pleased

1442
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,920
with the review scores this morning asked the website cliff b said doing great apart

1443
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:47,460
from a couple of haters magazine asked who were the haters and he said a certain gamer

1444
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:53,140
of the euro so kind of uh calling out euro gamer and what was their problem with the

1445
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:57,420
game i haven't read the review asked the magazine to which cliffy b followed up you know i don't

1446
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:02,100
quite gather it i don't want to come across as defensive how do i phrase this properly

1447
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:07,180
when people rated gear 2 higher than gears 3 it kind of upset me because i know gears

1448
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:12,980
3 is a better game on every level now here's the punch line it sounds like eurogamer really

1449
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:16,620
trashed the shit out of this game didn't it which they have done to some games and that

1450
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:23,300
they put this game in the toilet this game got an 8 out of 10 by eurogamer and they are

1451
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:29,820
haters because the game got an 8 out of 10 that's stupid care to elaborate why is it

1452
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:35,900
stupid i don't know why would someone just start this off because i mean 8 out of 10

1453
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:41,980
is good it's well above average you know maybe it's like oh i wanted a 9 out of 10 or 10

1454
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:45,980
out of 10 because it was exceptional it's perfect we can do no wrong maybe it sounds

1455
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:50,540
to me like the issue is gears 2 must have got a 9 or a 10 from the same website and

1456
01:13:50,540 --> 01:14:01,260
they dared to rate this game an 8 probably i mean i review scores you kind of have to

1457
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:05,780
take with a grain of salt anyway i mean it's not like they rated a game of four and there

1458
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:09,980
were some reviews out there on the internet they're rated final fantasy 13 a four out

1459
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:14,860
of 10 i'm sorry look at duke nukem forever perfect example like there's a ton of shitty

1460
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:20,300
reviews and there's a ton of really good reviews for it you have to look at your reviewer you

1461
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:25,220
know that's why i always thought that one of the most fair um reviewing systems was

1462
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:33,420
how um game pro used to do it so with their little uh faces emoticons no no no no how

1463
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:39,180
they would have like pick one game and have five people score it oh that was an egm thing

1464
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:43,260
now yeah that was egm sorry which is basically for me too well game pro used to do um two

1465
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:49,220
people back and forth but i liked i liked how you would have the main reviewer who would

1466
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:53,420
go over the the major points in the game and then you'd have what everyone else thought

1467
01:14:53,420 --> 01:15:01,060
of it and the average score is this that's fair i'm sorry first off why does anyone give

1468
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:05,260
a shit what cliffy b wants because cliffy b is a fucking douchebag that's what it comes

1469
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:09,220
down to he is a fucking douchebag he thinks he's a goddamn rock star because he has a

1470
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:14,340
few good games under his belt yeah great okay yeah epic games make some pretty cool shit

1471
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:21,560
and you act like a fucking douchebag so wow your game got an eight on one website go fucking

1472
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,180
cry in a corner then you little bitch it's it's interesting though because like if the

1473
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:29,640
game is that good then the review shouldn't matter right well here's the thing then if

1474
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:35,340
you're so you know hard up on you know getting an 8.0 and stuff fine why don't you blacklist

1475
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:39,280
eurogamer then if you're gonna take the high ground with that well my game was better i

1476
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:44,100
thought so because i made it yeah you know what i bet people that thought you know i

1477
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:48,060
bet the people that worked hard on duke nukem forever thought it was a great game too you

1478
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:53,340
know you don't see them fucking crying the number one movie at the box office every year

1479
01:15:53,340 --> 01:16:02,620
is rarely the most well reviewed think about that because a lot of people have no taste

1480
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:09,940
no he is a fucking douchebag plain and simple i don't really know the guy and i don't watch

1481
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:14,300
a lot of television which we talked about earlier video game related stuff so i don't

1482
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:19,340
know i i saw him once at e3 doing a demo i think at the first years of war game like

1483
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:23,780
a long time ago he seemed fine to me whatever i don't i don't got a problem come on but

1484
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:29,100
i i don't think an eight out of ten makes somebody a hater i understand you know if

1485
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:32,700
i understand he's passionate about his game that's fine but you know what if i made a

1486
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:37,340
fucking game and one site reviewed it you know a point lower than everybody else i wouldn't

1487
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:41,280
care i'd be like okay that's their opinion fine you know what if everybody rated it like

1488
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,460
a one or something like that or if like they came out and said i fucking hate the gears

1489
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,780
war series so i'm going to give it a one out of ten or something like that then yeah he

1490
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:52,740
could be pissed off but eight out of ten is just fine i don't understand what the big

1491
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:56,300
deal is well it was like when the websites were giving final fantasy 13 of four out of

1492
01:16:56,300 --> 01:17:00,420
ten i was like okay these are the websites i can't trust their reviews ever again because

1493
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:04,220
they're smoking crack over there they don't like the same games i like clearly remember

1494
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:09,020
there were multiple websites that were bombing final fantasy 13 because it was too linear

1495
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:13,060
but but i obviously didn't play uh far enough to find out when the game opens with the same

1496
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:19,440
time though yes that's fine and it's up to the people reading i mean if you're dumb enough

1497
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:23,560
to just go okay well this guy didn't like the game so i'm not gonna like it well yes

1498
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:29,020
if he likes a similar type of games that you like and he didn't like it then yes but if

1499
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:32,460
you're a gamer that's like well listen you can get a nine out of ten i can't buy this

1500
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:36,680
game i'm sorry i don't think there's anyone out there that's like that if you're gonna

1501
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,920
buy years of work because you like years of war it's not because someone gave it an eight

1502
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:44,440
or nine out of ten and i think eight out of ten is just fine but the fact that he just

1503
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:51,320
went out there and said wow eight out of ten that's what makes him a douchebag i'm sorry

1504
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:56,320
tiger claw in our chat room at chat.org says you should never base your views on a game

1505
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:01,200
based on a game review you play these games with an open mind and form your own opinion

1506
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:06,440
about it i'm mostly inclined to agree with that statement and in theory that's a really

1507
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:12,600
good statement but the only thing is that games cost 60 and if you're on the fence about

1508
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:18,320
a game you gotta go off something i prefer that to be hands-on experience be it game

1509
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:24,440
rental or game kiosk or something i mean usually i only drop 60 on a game on launch day because

1510
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:30,040
i've either a played it at a trade show or b really liked other games in the series so

1511
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:34,080
i've got to get it like civ 5 i bought right when it came out because i like the other

1512
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,960
civ games skyrim i will buy day one because it's an elder scrolls game i've seen all the

1513
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:44,560
stuff online i don't think it's going to disappoint me but games i'm on the fence about yeah maybe

1514
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,080
i want to see some reviews on before i spend the money on it you know but i also think

1515
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:53,640
the out of 10 system is kind of screwy anyway i just like if i were to review games i don't

1516
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,960
write a lot of game reviews because i think i'm a better talker than i am a writer but

1517
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,880
like if i were to do reviews like this like well we here on this even show we talk about

1518
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,800
our gaming weeks we don't really give games scores uh i just kind of like to summarize

1519
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:11,080
in a couple sentences you'll like this game if you like japanese rpgs otherwise maybe

1520
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:14,440
and then sometimes there's a game where it's like wow i don't care what type of games you're

1521
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:18,360
into you've got to check this out because it is doing something that no other game does

1522
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:22,500
you know what i mean like i think that is the best way to sum up a game i think that's

1523
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:28,280
more fair but the typical person wants to just say oh too long didn't read you can't

1524
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:35,160
translate that into a metacritic score right so there you go all right anyhow i just wanted

1525
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:38,560
to talk reviews for a little bit thought that would be a fun little tangent i'm gonna read

1526
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:44,120
it seven out of ten are you going on a metacritic to read it seven i would know i was just gonna

1527
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:48,880
see i want to see what the actual lowest review is on oh critic for sure i just want to see

1528
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,560
if you know if anybody bombed it worse than eurogamer destructoid gave it an eight out

1529
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:58,880
of ten as well do you do they well hold on it's metacritic is calling it an 80 but i

1530
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,200
don't know destructories review scale that could also be four out of five stars could

1531
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,960
be an eight okay that's still four out of five it's not five out of five or four and

1532
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:11,500
a half out of five that's still 80 well you know what i have a friend who basically like

1533
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:15,520
whenever you know we talk about a movie or something he's always talking about oh well

1534
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,360
rotten tomatoes rated this and blah blah i'm like yeah but what did they say about the

1535
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,080
movie what did they say about the acting what did they say about this because i don't really

1536
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:27,720
give a crap what the score is i care what the part vinny and you know me i like your

1537
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:32,000
movies that people have blasted if there's fun parts in them i'll watch the movie again

1538
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,240
i'll go see it again i don't care because i enjoyed it my favorite movies are like stupid

1539
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:40,760
movies like i like i like mystery science theater 3000 types of events that's why i

1540
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:45,480
like showgirls so much showgirls is a terrible fucking movie but it is so much fun to watch

1541
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:52,280
i know with friends well you remember my bachelorette party what did we watch barbarella in xanadu

1542
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:56,160
i remember that that was great and then we went to the goth club that was great i think

1543
01:20:56,160 --> 01:21:00,960
that was the last time i went to the goth club that was the last time i went to good

1544
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,040
time anyway well to that one anyway i went to the other ones let's move on let's move

1545
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:09,120
on uh dark soccer you got a quick story for us and then release dates well basically um

1546
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:14,480
microsoft is saying that um windows 8 will support xbox live but they're not really saying

1547
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:20,200
anything else about games for windows live they're just basically like um uh they're

1548
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:24,080
actual their spokesperson said and they quote we currently have nothing to announce beyond

1549
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:29,840
the statement that major nelson posted on his blog so what i'm thinking is that you're

1550
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:36,640
going to be able to manage your xbox live account and maybe some games will cross over

1551
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:41,800
i think i could see some type of like messenger or video chat tie-in or skype or whatever

1552
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,640
ultimate direction they go in i think just a way for like when you are signed into your

1553
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:50,420
computer you are still within the xbox live network yeah what i'm wondering about is that

1554
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:55,200
does this mean that you know they've talked about going more an app style direction with

1555
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,520
windows 8 which you know obviously although you can use the classic you can you can but

1556
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:04,020
they're calling like the desktop is like a type of app yeah saying it's weird but obviously

1557
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:08,000
they're going that more apple route which you know is is not too surprising especially

1558
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,280
because this runs on tablets but here's my question does that mean and i'm totally inferring

1559
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:18,980
here but does that mean that apps will be run in microsoft points and maybe your points

1560
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:23,400
are used across systems that would be very well that's how they did it with zoom i thought

1561
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:28,440
zoom marketplace wasn't a all together it could yeah and it could but but at the same

1562
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:33,400
time you know games for windows live or whatever ran in real dollars the my the xbox live does

1563
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:39,400
use real dollars in one portion it's the uh uh buying the old games yeah uh games on demand

1564
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,880
games on demand thank you it uses real dollars as opposed to the microsoft points so i could

1565
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,360
go either way i don't know well and with points you know you're always gonna have leftover

1566
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,380
you're gonna have an odd amount they've i think they've arranged it that way to where

1567
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:54,000
you buy them you're gonna have some leftover well so if you want to get anything else you've

1568
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,640
still got to have that not anymore actually not anymore uh they have changed the denominations

1569
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:04,300
that you can buy uh yeah but depending on what you're buying you still i still find

1570
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:08,400
myself left with like 80 points if you're buying you know if you're buying a card or

1571
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,580
something like that where it's twenty dollar you know fifty dollar increments then yes

1572
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:16,840
you may be left over stuff but they actually do have it now where you can buy 800 400 but

1573
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:21,480
they want you to do that we're like oh i have 80 points in my account i i could get this

1574
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:26,600
stupid little uh little hat for my avatar i never think of that i never think that you

1575
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:31,640
don't but a lot of people do a lot of people do my only crazy purchase i ever did on playstation

1576
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:37,380
network was dressing my character up like a hobo santa and i am still hobo santa in

1577
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:42,420
home which i have not been to forever so probably dead hope santa at this point well and and

1578
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:47,280
to be fair i did buy the taylor swift microphone for my avatar on xbox live actually the only

1579
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:52,060
thing that i thought is i had leftover points and i bought one of the steampunk tops just

1580
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,920
because i thought it was really cute so we've all been guilty of buying some stupid shit

1581
01:23:54,920 --> 01:24:01,320
online i hope santa is not free speaking of buying stupid shit let's travel around the

1629
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:05,080
stories before you guys before we get to the classic game of the week but first loki yes

1630
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:09,400
um i think we talked a little bit about it last week how there was a cable company in

1631
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:16,880
canada that was actually throttling uh internet speeds with uh gaming on them and it's actually

1632
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:22,680
a little bit of a follow-up to that they've uh the canadian radio and television telecommunications

1633
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:29,840
commission that's a mouthful uh cited that rogers own policy which claims that the online

1634
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,240
games like world of warcraft um should not be throttled and telling the company has now

1635
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:39,000
until september 27th to present a plan that keeps world of warcraft traffic and that of

1636
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:45,260
other games unthrottled so i guess that's good news for canada wish uh wish we had people

1637
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:51,080
that actually had power over here in the united states to do that kind of thing because internet

1638
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:56,640
cable companies are running like crazy and pretty much have full power to throttle over

1639
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:01,120
the fuck they want well they got the smackdown so that's a good little follow-up to what

1640
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:06,480
we were talking about last week hooray yeah all right i want to talk about this this is

1641
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:11,440
uh also in foreign country news this is about australia and one of the retailers they are

1642
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:19,560
game australia they have a new customer rewards card uh and it's kind of interesting because

1643
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:27,160
what the hell is this you use your fingers in place of naughty bits for example imagine

1644
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:31,800
there's a guy standing on the card looking down towards his crotch and there's a hole

1645
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:36,600
there for you to put your finger through and you can make it a little winky or you could

1646
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:42,640
put two fingers through as you could hear on this little card and have a butt clearly

1647
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:47,300
this is all just to be provocative and i'm kind of surprised no one over here has tried

1648
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:52,600
this yet just getting people talking and so forth uh really that that's really all there

1649
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:59,640
is to it it's just you know to you know look like a wiener and so forth however it is drawing

1650
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:04,360
complaints of course not everybody likes this how dare you use two fingers to look like

1651
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:09,360
a butt in the cutout of the card uh complaints have been filed with the accc that is the

1652
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:14,540
australian competition and consumer commission game has not acknowledged or commented on

1653
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:19,360
these complaints uh when questioned about these cards they just talk about how great

1654
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,880
the reward programs is and all the stuff that they can get back we've decided to relaunch

1655
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:27,800
the reward card program with its extra benefits blah blah blah blah blah and your finger's

1656
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:33,720
a wiener no they haven't said anything about that of course i will say this there is that

1657
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:38,480
kind of hidden you know undertone and that is when the major media reports on this it

1658
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:46,440
just makes gamers look like a bunch of immature assholes of course you said ass and hole remember

1659
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:53,160
the wiener is you all right a winner is you right now because right now we're going to

1660
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:59,300
go through the gaming archives and find a classic game of the week every week dark sakura

1661
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:03,760
dives into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks hey you kids need to

1662
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:09,440
show this game more respect screw the vita and screw the 3ds back in my day this game

1663
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:17,760
was the bee's knees dark sakura i can make better boobs in chat than kevin68 can seriously

1664
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:23,120
that's right a lot better chat um the today's game is the sims

1665
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:30,400
yes the sims the game that started it on while we're all playing that stupid game on facebook

1666
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:38,000
um basically the sims is uh a game is this actual game noises sorry yes that's actual game noises

1667
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,800
and they're playing in a fast four which is like the best one i can find okay but it's a

1668
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:49,200
life simulation game pretty much it's um was uh designed by will wright which you know what else

1669
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:56,880
he did sim city so basically you can control and spore you can control your little sim person or

1670
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:04,640
some people or sim family in their little lives and suburbs and so uh that's really the game but

1671
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:11,040
it's on all kinds of expansion packs and stuff and now we're on the sims 3 which i've been playing

1672
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:16,080
so basically the way that your sim let's just say that you've got one sim you may

1673
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:22,240
name him you know bob the sim or something so they've got you've got npc's and you've got your

1674
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:27,520
actual sim and your sim can interact with the npc's and get married you eventually will be able to

1675
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:32,480
control the sim that they marry blah blah but you have different stages of life you can make an

1676
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:38,960
you have an infant a child and an adult and that's just in the sims um babies will grow into children

1677
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:44,240
and children and adults never age so that means that they can stay in their little lifespan

1678
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:48,960
indefinitely but they can die from different stuff like burning to death drowning in a pool

1679
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:53,200
starving dying from disease and the grim reaper will come and take them away but you have to win

1680
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:59,120
against them in rock paper scissors um or you will actually die your sim will actually die and

1681
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:04,880
stay dead and your tombstone will show up i like in sims 3 how you know if you kill a sim they'll

1682
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:10,720
just start haunting the house it's pretty awesome anyway um you've got uh live mode which is uh

1683
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:15,200
where you do all your you know your gameplay and then you have build and buy mode where build mode

1684
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:22,320
is where you build your house you start off with 20 000 simoleons which is their uh uh money system

1685
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:29,920
and you've got buy mode where you can buy house parts and do stuff so in your lives your sims do

1686
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:34,880
have a little bit of free will they can you know autonomously do stuff you can control i think the

1687
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:42,960
level of their free will and but basically you still have to make them pee you have to

1688
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:46,880
make them find a job and pay their bills and work out and you know make babies and shit

1689
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:55,120
but basically you go make a baby i thought it was funny um because this actually mentions

1690
01:34:55,120 --> 01:35:00,480
that their system of needs follow maslow's hierarchy of needs in which the physiological

1691
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:08,080
needs must be satisfied before other needs can be attended to so you know they they'll piss it you

1692
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:12,160
know they'll piss on the floor if you know you don't tell them to go to the bathroom or if like

1693
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:17,280
you forget to build a toilet which i had a friend do or if they don't eat they'll die of starvation

1694
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:22,880
so they're and their needs their physical needs are what govern their mood so the the more that

1695
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:28,320
their needs are taken care of the better mood that they'll be in i've got needs or for example

1696
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:33,680
if you're playing um the the sim social you know how you don't get inspired until all your needs

1697
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:39,120
are in the green same diff then you'll be happy i'm thinking i'm done with sim social and i'm

1698
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:45,680
gonna block it on facebook i don't like it i like my house i hate the spammy spam like it's getting

1699
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:51,120
bad yeah like there's a little do you need to put a feedback window where you can leave them

1700
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:57,360
feedback about oh really not liking any of that so you might want to try to leave i got feedback

1701
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:07,040
block well anyway so basically it's kind of like an artificial life program if you look at it in

1702
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:11,760
that respect and you can keep playing and playing and like i used to in the first things i used to

1703
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,320
just kill people all the time and um my friend had a great everybody did that with the sims

1704
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:20,720
at first you have to create creative death traps for your sims like it's just it's a way of getting

1705
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:25,760
out stress well one of my friends actually had what she called the house of death and like it

1706
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:30,560
was all kinds of ways that you know they could set themselves on fire and things and she had

1707
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:38,640
a graveyard in front of the house it was it was julius house dan i'm sure you remember that um so

1708
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:43,440
basically um now if with your kids you can they can study at home and keep their grades up but

1709
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:47,680
if they miss too many school days they are transported to a military academy indefinitely

1710
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:54,960
and they can't um prepare food or earn money so basically they're useless children are useless

1711
01:36:54,960 --> 01:37:03,840
so i mean basically your sims can fight with other sims they do stuff and they can actually be uh

1712
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:10,000
locked into an undead state by keeping them from leaving the hot tub or the bed and so they'll like

1713
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:17,360
keep interacting with other people but they won't be able to leave they can't even they don't they

1714
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:24,000
don't die they're just undead so basically um in the first sims it actually did use a combination

1715
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:31,200
of 2d and 3d the sims themselves are 3d but everything in it are pre-rendered so the game

1716
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:40,880
clearly has been a success it uh sold more than 6.3 million copies worldwide and as of uh

1717
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:50,480
as of february 7 2005 had 16 million copies shipped worldwide and of course it's been highly

1718
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:58,560
pirated and um the music in the game was done by jerry martin mark russo kirk r casey and dicks

1719
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,960
bruce and these people have actually i think gone through and done all the other sim music so you

1720
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,880
can actually buy soundtracks of all the sim music and it's got its own little unique perky little

1721
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:13,360
style you know it's cute now this is the part that i am interested in in particular is simlish

1722
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:20,640
which they wanted to avoid a way to um they wanted to avoid localization of spoken dialogue

1723
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:25,440
so the best way for them to do it was to create a language now simlish can i play some of the songs

1724
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:30,160
in simlish because they're really bad find find the lily allen one find the one for smile because

1725
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:38,000
it was actually really cute and the video is adorable um is that it yes there's an elifertado

1726
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:48,720
one by the way

1727
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:52,400
this kind of reminds me of uh kids bop i don't know why the nelifertado was actually kind of cool

1728
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:58,320
too baby language bop well the whole point was with simlish oh and didn't katie perry did yeah

1729
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:02,640
i was gonna say here here's one for uh salacious pop who i know is a huge fan of this artist

1730
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:10,480
it's funny that's why you hear when it hears the song if you play it backwards it's devil's speak

1731
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:17,520
and that's why she's popular listen she's listen play it backwards she's saying that she killed

1732
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:34,080
michael jackson to get that record but actually these little videos that they did for him were

1733
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:40,240
really cute anyway anyway simlish is really a bunch of gibberish but um they were gonna actually

1734
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:49,680
base it they created it by experimenting with ukrainian french and tagalog and he wanted to

1735
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:56,400
base it off of navajo but instead just went for gibberish that sounds like the same inflections

1736
01:39:56,400 --> 01:40:00,720
that you'd hear in everyday speech they really got those bitches to sing in a baby language

1737
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:05,440
pretty much i was watching how did somebody convince katie perry that's a good idea

1738
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:14,080
cha-ching you like money bitch right here's some money there was a special about it um i watched

1739
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:18,080
like one of the behind the scenes for the sims 3 about them recording some of the songs in simlish

1740
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:22,720
and basically they are just nonsensical things that fit the phrasing of the original song

1741
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:28,480
and they're like you know it was kind of fun and you know it's kind of neat to see the sim version

1742
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:33,920
of me and you know so like besides being paid i've seen a lot about the songs that i've seen

1743
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,440
besides being paid i've seen a lot amounts of money you know they said it was fun they just

1744
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:44,240
showed what the lyric sheet looked like and it was all me my moo my mama me horgy wow you know

1745
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:52,080
whatever they say in sim simlish but um the different expansions were living large

1746
01:40:52,720 --> 01:41:00,160
house party hot date vacation unleashed superstar superstar and making magic which was the last one

1747
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:07,520
and then sims 2 came out and then we have sims 3 now and honestly i think sims 2 was kind of better

1748
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:15,440
than sims 3 but i really like sims 3 except it's so fucking slow ah but now keep in mind there's

1749
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:22,480
also a ton of mods out there in fact i think maxis really doesn't give a shit about the modding

1750
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:26,400
community i mean they've tried they say oh people want special stuff so they've got their own sim

1751
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:31,760
store and everything now but really the modding community is just crazy and there's even like

1752
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,320
special modding tools now for for like universe makers and they've released their own custom

1753
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:42,800
universe maker and since too they had um custom build the fucking universe they had a custom sims

1754
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:48,320
maker where you could try on skins and different things and really just do all kinds of neat stuff

1755
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:55,040
to them and now like in sims 3 you can adjust their boob size there's there's um uh model

1756
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:59,600
modifiers built in like you could even change all kinds of features on their face and everything

1757
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:04,640
but people have gone further and made boob modifiers and butt modifiers and hip modifiers and

1758
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:08,480
there's even um elven ear modifiers where you can give them a combination between

1759
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:14,720
tulcan style elven ears and wow style elven ears or you can just get really huge dumbo ears so

1760
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:23,680
it's just you can farm you can and now the first thing that i did whenever uh in sims 3 now

1761
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:29,680
whenever i just you know met some random person and ended up marrying them like um they my sim

1762
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:34,160
that was carrying around like a relationship with five girls and two dudes like for some time

1763
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:39,040
finally ended up marrying some girl sim slut so it's finally ended up marrying some girl except

1764
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:44,800
her model was like really crappy so you can actually go into uh um the the stylist mode

1765
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:49,920
are you saying you bought your wife a ton of plastic surgery yes i did yes i did i made my

1766
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:55,200
wife look not not because honestly the original sim faces and since they were really derpy

1767
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,520
so and now there's all kinds of special skins and hairs and stuff that doesn't look too derpy

1768
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:05,280
and but anyway the first sims is what started it all and i played a good bit of that and i played

1769
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:09,360
a lot of sims 2 because sims 2 was the one where they figured out how to crack the animation code

1770
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:14,000
and started having dirty things like you could buy dildos and a rug that had like you know

1771
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:19,600
butt sex animation and all kinds of stuff well this is a well-timed classic game of the week

1772
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:25,520
because you know the sims is or was like the biggest pc game ever it might have got beat by

1773
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:29,440
world of warcraft eventually i don't know or one of the blizzard games but uh the sims is still

1774
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:34,240
in a huge huge pc game and obviously with the sim social now being like a huge facebook game

1775
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:38,560
despite the fact that that thing spams the shit out of all your friends with all facebook

1776
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:44,160
it is topical to make sure you know where that comes from well i'm sure everybody has that story

1777
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:49,840
about you know terrorizing sims now here's actually a little um bit of news that i just

1778
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:55,120
found out i wasn't aware of on may 25th 2007 there's a sims film rights were purchased by

1781
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:11,600

1830
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:03,840
although it's weird because none of those tracks were actually on nevermind but if i'm not mistaken

1831
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,400
nevermind that whole album was already released into rock band some time ago maybe for the

1832
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:14,080
15th or something i don't know they are doing pro guitar and bass upgrades for plenty of nirvana

1842
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:09,760
out in the us as well so if you uh like your capcom fighters that's gonna be a pretty big

1849
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:49,520
there's some interesting arranged music that has uh tracks on the sampler cd piano collections

1850

01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:51,680
mac yeah when steam for mac came out then portal came out for free but if for whatever reason you

1870
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:56,960
just you've been resistant to steam or and you didn't get it last time or if somehow you're like

1871
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:01,680
the one person that hasn't played portal yet you you really should just like try it like i'm not

1872
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:06,000
just saying that it is a pretty fucking rad game it's really awesome it's super cool even if you

1873
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,520
hate first-person shooters it's more of a puzzle game i don't like first-person shooters and i play

1874
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:15,760
the hell out of portal 2 yeah yeah and portal 2 is so fucking good i know uh before we get back

1875
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,520
into some long form news i want to give a plug for this um i didn't talk about this at the

1876
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:23,440
beginning of the show because i wanted you know the people that really stick with the show into a

1877
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:27,600
uh who stick with it to really hear this um because you're gonna hear this on a lot of

1878
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:31,760
podcasts over the next few weeks it's that time of year where the podcast awards are coming around

1879
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:36,400
and i'm i'm always kind of on the fence about this like i don't like that it's like a gigantic

1880
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:41,600
popularity contest it was a lot more fun the first year and i'm not just saying that because we won

1881
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:45,680
although you know obviously that that helped uh but it was more about like independent

1882
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:50,800
shows then like it seriously seemed like all of the independent independent video game podcast

1883
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:55,920
that existed at the time this is a long time ago uh this is like six years ago were nominated that

1884
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:02,240
year um i don't think we've been nominated since and let's be real as much as i don't like that

1885
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:08,160
it's a popularity contest and you hear about this on every single show it is really good exposure

1886
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:14,080
for the show and kind of helps us stand out in a very crowded field of uh podcasts if we do get

1887
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:19,120
nominated and possibly win i would really just i mean we've won before so it's cool as long as

1888
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:23,680
some independent podcast wins i think that's really important and uh i don't want to see

1889
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:30,080
a bunch of corporate funded paid for commercialized podcasts get nominated so

1890
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:36,000
i'm gonna just kind of bite the bullet and ask would you consider nominating orange lounge radio

1891
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:42,080
for best gaming podcast it's www.podcastawards.com i believe nominations are open until like the

1892
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:46,160
30th so not too much longer this is probably the only time you're going to hear us mention on the

1893
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:51,120
show please if you like the show it's free we don't shove commercials down your throat just

1894
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:55,920
help us get this exposure it's all we really ask head over to podcastawards.com and please consider

1895
01:54:55,920 --> 01:55:02,800
nominating us for best gaming podcast um you can only nominate the show in like one category you

1896
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:08,080
maybe can do best produced as well yeah i'm not i i don't even have delusions that we would get

1897
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:14,320
nominated in those categories yeah right so i don't well somehow many years ago we got nominated for

1898
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:19,760
best of life 365 best station well i know how we did it it's because our fans are awesome and

1899
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:26,320
because not a lot of life 365 stations had rabid fan bases like ours we may not have thousands of

1900
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:32,080
listeners we have loyal listeners and that is that is an awesome feeling above all else like

1901
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:37,040
even if we don't get nominated oh wells you know we still have you guys that turn up on sunday

1902
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:41,760
nights and then download our podcast every week that makes it worthwhile but i'm just gonna say

1903
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:47,680
if you like the show help us get the exposure get us the nomination we'll go to the stinking

1904
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:51,920
ceremony maybe adam curry will be there again dark soccer went to the first award ceremony

1905
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:56,000
what is it to that she has the award sitting up on the desk yeah 2005 podcast awards for

1906
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,400
i'll put the picture up on to go addition with uh next to and you saw adam curry's hair right

1907
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:06,880
oh your mic just literally fell apart live on air that's why we're not going to get nominated folks

1908
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:13,600
yes he had he had um the rock star type hair you know like the bon jovi style hair you know where

1909
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:19,120
they did have really long bushy 80s hair and then got it cut into that 90s cut he had that

1910
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:24,720
uh and uh let's see oh brad from pod cultures in the chat saying i don't mess with the podcast

1911
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:29,280
awards we don't stand a chance well then i'll then i'll say go nominate pod culture for best

1912
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:32,640
sci-fi is there like a sci-fi category there's got to be right there's got to be like a fandom

1913
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:37,280
or sci-fi category go dominate pod culture for that i would say nominate bobby but he would be

1914
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:42,000
he would be kind of competition so he would if he gets nominated we don't definitely vote for him

1915
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:48,480
uh no you know what nominate bobby for best produced because he's a one-man band and he works

1916
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:53,280
his ass off every week to do and he's juggling his whole little drum thing that he does with the

1917
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:59,200
football nfl with his show so nominate him for best produced we don't we just we just want people

1918
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:02,960
more people to hear about our show because we can't afford to advertise in magazines and all

1919
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:08,880
that good stuff so podcastwords.com nominate us for best gaming podcast nominate us only once

1920
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:15,040
it's uploading oh the award we won with unpun man awesome it would be it'd also be kind of neat like

1921
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:19,280
i gotta say i'm not gonna lie be kind of neat to have won that award like in 2005 and then like if

1922
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:26,800
we get nominated again if big if i don't think any other show maybe certainly no other gaming shows

1923
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:33,680
could claim that they've been nominated that many years apart yeah i don't know maybe what other

1924
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:37,600
shows from back then are still going i think video game news radio is probably the only one

1925
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,600
i think they're still going i think they're still live or they're not live on all games they do the

1926
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:46,640
tape thing on all games so maybe they they could get in there too which would be cool i'd be happy

1927
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:51,440
for them it's another indie show those guys work hard yeah so as long as an indie show wins at the

1928
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:57,600
end of the day i'm happy but if freaking blank blank blank corporate website wins i'm not going

1929
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:02,240
to be happy so let's at least push some indie to the top okay i've said last year

1930
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:12,240
i think it was four player podcast which i think actually um i i see some of them on twitter so

1931
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:16,640
they are an indie thing i think they're like a justin tv related thing they do a lot with that

1932
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:20,880
stuff which we used to do the video broadcast but they've taken it all to the next level i

1933
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:25,520
think they were the ones that won last year so that that is definitely an indie show as well

1934
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:31,600
and and if they win it again good on them good for them all right let's move on though more

1935
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:36,240
gaming news i don't want to talk about that anymore i've given it far too much time loki uh

1936
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:43,360
yes um so let's talk about gamestop you know how they have their streaming service coming

1937
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:49,440
um well we know that because the whole whole debacle with uh you know deus x and that kind

1938
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:55,200
of stuff but uh there's a little bit more to that as well um they've announced that they're

1939
01:58:55,200 --> 01:59:01,120
going to be doing some sort of uh android branded tablet or i guess there'll be an android tablet

1940
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:06,160
that's gamestop branded that's going to be a pair to the dedicated controller peripheral that's

1941
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:12,240
going to be coming out later next year and the thought is that the device will support i guess

1942
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:20,320
mobile apps and the goals allow full streaming of release titles to the tablet kind of like on live

1943
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:27,360
or something like that very interesting and very unsettling creepy to me but yeah fine if you want

1944
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:33,040
to release a tablet that's fine it's more power to you but at the same time the tablet market is

1945
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:41,680
pretty crowded so i'll pass thanks exactly that's that's pretty much what i have to say on that i

1946
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:51,120
just pass i i don't know i i think it's gonna be difficult for them to do that but they want to try

1947
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:55,360
fine dart has to be in our chat room at chat.org saying you're not supposed to say the name of the

1948
01:59:55,360 --> 02:00:05,760
company whatever you know you know how we feel all right uh moving on to some other gaming news

1949
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:10,160
or actually this isn't really gaming per se but it's certainly that uh gaming device that you use

1950
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:13,440
for gaming that's sitting in your living room that's soon going to be your entertainment device

1951
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:18,720
if it's not already microsoft is launching a tv service for the xbox 360 this holiday season you

1952
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:24,000
kind of already knew that via e3 but it was confirmed by microsoft ceo steve balmer at a

1953
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:29,120
financial analyst meeting that happened this past week microsoft is working with quote dozens or

1954
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:35,760
hundreds of additional video content suppliers how to dozens or hundreds what how does that even work

1955
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:42,240
well whatever um xbox tv is going to use the connect it's going to use bing and all that stuff

1956
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:47,760
you know like you were seeing in that demo at e3 uh and uh yeah it's there's a big difference

1957
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:52,080
between dozens and hundreds there is a big difference between dozens and hundreds there

1958
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:57,920
you know working with one or a million somewhere between that i guess it's probably hard because

1959
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:01,920
they don't have a lot confirmed right now but i wonder if this is like xbox's kind of way to take

1960
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:07,040
a jab at netflix while they're down which is interesting because netflix is a big it's weird

1961
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:12,320
because netflix is a big part of the 360 right now anyway but a lot of you know netflix has

1962
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:17,120
really had a hard past couple months and it's just going to get worse for them when they lose stars

1963
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:24,800
so yeah their stock is tumbling if microsoft pays out the anus to get all these agreements that

1964
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:31,520
netflix is losing it could be the thing to have i don't know it's gonna be interesting so wonder

1965
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:38,720
if their service is really popular if they just drop netflix you never know it's possible so is

1966
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:45,840
there any interest in um um a microsoft tv network i'd check it out i mean if it's gonna be included

1967
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:51,200
as part of my gold subscription then sure hell yeah free tv i especially if they have on-demand

1968
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:56,240
stuff even if it's commercials if i get it for free i'm fine i get limited cable now fucking

1969
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:01,440
fx i don't get that anymore because they're paying for limited cable and actually at my

1970
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:07,680
box as an error right now so i don't get any on demand whatsoever um so yeah i look forward to

1971
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:14,400
anything free i'll cancel cable again i would even just be happy if i could watch like shows

1972
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:20,000
that are on cbs just later when i want not have to go on to cbs.com but like watch it in hd on my tv

1973
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,760
i would really like that like just being able to watch survivor like the next day because wednesday

1974
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:28,800
nights are raid nights so i can't watch survivor live shut up don't judge me uh cinderwolf is in

1975
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:34,080
our chat room at chat.orangeandre.com a proud canadian because uh he's saying and canada gets

1976
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:38,960
short changed again as we have been with the internet tv feature included within windows

1977
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:45,840
media center well hasn't this similar feature been out in like europe and britain specifically

1978
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:49,920
for some time like the sky tv arrangement or is this like is this even beyond that like this is

1979
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:54,640
just a step further where microsoft is now like trying to be the cable provider they're going a

1980
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:59,120
little further because before like i've heard a bunch of things i've heard one they're talking

1981
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:04,800
about working with your own cable con like basically it would be like a portal to the

1982
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:10,320
on-demand content that you have with whatever cable provider they have um to that they are

1983
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:15,040
going to be the content provider for all that stuff i would prefer the latter because you know

1984
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:21,120
i if i want to watch on demand stuff i can just do it through my tv you know if if we're talking

1985
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:26,800
about my cable provider if you know i i rather be microsoft's own content you know some original

1986
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:33,440
shows be nice or you know i or just one versus 100 coming back i'm never gonna let up on that

1987
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:39,120
um but i think canada will probably get it eventually but you're you the way of thinking

1988
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:42,960
is probably right because there's a follow-up comment here cinderwolf says content will be

1989
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:47,920
extremely changed and limited compared to us tv available online sadly he's probably right

1990
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:52,000
is that canada will probably get it eventually so will mexico so we'll you know wherever else

1991
02:03:52,000 --> 02:04:02,400
xbox does business yeah whatever you saw tech tv so stop bitching so i will swap you you can have

1992
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:09,280
all the crappy content that we have here and i'll take tech tv that would you know it would be kind

1993
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:13,520
of cool if it would work the other way and we could get some canadian shows here like oh yeah

1994
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:18,160
they get because of the content laws up there they get a lot of localized versions of shows too like

1995
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:23,360
they have uh or they had so you think you can dance canada they had canadian idol and all that

1996
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:28,160
stuff i don't think they have a lot of these shows anymore and but uh i don't know it might be fun to

1997
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:33,360
watch like tech tv and stuff there's many countries that have their own version of the office so that

1998
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:39,360
would be kind of oh yeah yeah be fun all right anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news

2033
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:33,280
show get some more news out we'll get the twitter topics and skype line coming very soon

2034
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:39,920
but first loki yeah we talked a little bit earlier part a about yeah developers bitching and moaning

2035
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:47,600
about their games and how they're treated poor poor my 8 8.0 what'd you get at nine well there's

2036
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:54,240
a different person um bitching now quadratic dreams co-founder i'm not even trying to pronounce

2037
02:08:54,240 --> 02:09:01,040
his name some french guy anyways uh he estimates that the studio lost between um five and ten

2038
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:08,800
million euro um due to second-hand sales um basically we sold today approximately two

2039
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:14,960
million units we know from the trophy system that probably three more than three million people uh

2040
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:20,640
bought the game and played it um a small level it's a million people playing the game without

2041
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:27,200
giving me one cent too fucking bad is what i say to that what about the rentals or friends loaning

2042
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:34,240
their copies to other friends or multiple psn accounts on the same playstation or you know

2043
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:40,960
too fucking bad is what i say i i don't care you know what that's that's a fact of any business out

2044
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:47,760
there there's going to be a second-hand market for it cars appliances electronics movies games

2045
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:54,960
furniture whatever you suck it up that's part of the economy is that there's going to be secondhand

2046
02:09:54,960 --> 02:10:00,960
sales and if you try to prevent it no one's gonna buy your product first hand make an awesome game

2047
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:05,840
that people want to buy day one you know what i mean heavy rain although heavy rain is a pretty

2048
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:13,200
good game heavy rain is all right but it's you know people get how much replayability is there

2049
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:18,960
really with heavy rain i mean it's a pretty linear game once you're done the thing you know it's like

2050
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:23,520
watching a movie i mean once you've seen it so many times unless you're a super fan of the movie

2051
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:30,000
you can probably get rid of it and be fine um you know and his other comment is all now uh are games

2052
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,240
too expensive i've always said the games are probably too expensive so there's probably a

2053
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:39,200
right level here to find and we need to discuss this all together and try to find a way that i

2054
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:45,280
would i would say reconcile consumer expectations retail expectations but also the expectations of

2055
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:49,520
the publishers and developers who make this business uh worthwhile business

2056
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:58,000
but once again though i i don't feel bad for you that your game sold used too fucking bad

2057
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,360
where all the other publishers bitching about secondhand sales you know from their games

2058
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:08,880
suck it up hey you know what you sold a couple million copies people are interested maybe that's

2059
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:13,680
better than most games do if you know if you have three million people play your game and you

2060
02:11:13,680 --> 02:11:18,800
release a sequel maybe they'll those three million people will buy it new instead of buying it used

2061
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:23,520
but you know what there's always gonna be people buying your game used and i think that's a good

2062
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:28,240
thing because at least they're buying your game or interested in your product and they may become

2063
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:33,760
fans of your publishing comp or your you know development house or whatever and let me see hey

2064
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,600
there's a game that i may be more interested in purchasing new and it's by this you know development

2065
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:46,480
house yeah maybe i'm gonna go buy it um but you know i i just this type of mind frame and stuff

2066
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:51,040
it just to me it seems like the next step is oh i'm gonna try to find a way to prevent the

2067
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:56,720
secondhand sales and then that's where we getting the whole other problems but it's not gonna go

2068
02:11:56,720 --> 02:12:02,240
away all right well let's move on to a story about a game that maybe some folks would have bought

2069
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:06,720
new i know a lot of people bought it new over here or put out more dlc because then those people

2070
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:11,040
about you way to ruin my transition can buy the dlc i think there is dlc for heavy rain isn't it

2071
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:17,280
put more all right anyhow let's talk about uh rock band in japan i didn't know this that harmonix

2072
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:22,880
was uh teaming up with q entertainment back in 2008 to actually put rock band out in japan but

2073
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:28,000
it didn't happen uh q entertainment actually walked away from it now apparently um harmonix

2074
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:32,720
uh didn't end up ever putting the game out in japan uh they said that they were i guess there's

2075
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:36,160
been questions that have come up at tokyo game show this week and so forth because you know they

2076
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:42,240
did put out dance central which is uh also you know coming out in japan uh dance central too and

2077
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:45,280
in an interview this week they were saying that they were very much interested in bringing the

2078
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:50,160
experience to the japanese market but there were just some challenges a lot of it had to do with

2079
02:12:50,160 --> 02:12:55,120
the fact that you know trying to get all those plastic peripherals to an island country i guess

2080
02:12:55,120 --> 02:13:00,080
proved difficult just the fact that people have smaller homes and all that stuff of course i kind

2081
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:05,280
of go well what about like guitar hero and or excuse me uh guitar freaks and drum freaks and

2082
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:12,880
all that um harmonix i guess at one point was looking at arcades as a way to do it but they

2083
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:17,200
said that arcades are very very noisy and if you're trying to make something that's really a

2084
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:23,120
musical experience it uh and you've got 37 other arcade machines all turned up to full volume it

2085
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:30,400
kind of impairs the musicality of the experience um i don't know konami's done pretty well at least

2086
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:34,640
in the past didn't guitar you see i thought that rock band always had come out in japan but i guess

2087
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:38,960
not i guess it was guitar hero did guitar hero came out over there they got the exact same game

2088
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:43,120
we got you see here's the answer to that you know if it's louder you put more speakers in your

2089
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:47,840
cabinet that's it so it's louder that's right more louder

2090
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:54,960
there you go uh legend of zaku and chat says bullshit konami was trying to sue their ass

2091
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:59,520
that's why i don't remember that wasn't the lawsuit lawsuit was never about harmonix wasn't

2092
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:06,640
about activision i think it was activision i don't remember it's all been so long ago now

2093
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:13,760
2008 that was like three years ago good lord all right uh dark soccer what do you got for us

2094
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:21,600
just something about oblivion the european um oblivion fifth anniversary edition release date

2100
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:59,600

2101
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:05,440
the steelbook casing in europe but it will in the us i wonder if it's that same walkthrough video

2102
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:10,480
that hit youtube this past week for skyrim that was a pretty good video no idea but people like

2103
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:15,360
oblivion i didn't know that was in a steelbook case in the us i thought it was just re-released

2104
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:20,000
with to be coming out and it's the anniversary edition is coming out in the steelbook case

2105
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:26,080
in the u.s in the u.s but it's already come out in the u.s it came out back in july

2106
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:31,440
actually in the june maybe this is a new new one yeah fifth anniversary edition it was the fifth

2107
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:37,280
anniversary huh well it said it had the steelbook case in the u.s whatever um maybe it did i i

2108
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:41,040
bought the game like five years ago i'm not gonna buy it again just because they threw in some extra

2109
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:48,160
shit well you get 10 bucks off uh skyrim if you buy the game too i mean if you haven't played it

2110
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:52,640
you know that's good oh yeah if you've never played oblivion it's worth checking out it is i mean

2111
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:59,040
it's not like a job it's not fucking final fantasy it is not final fantasy but it is it's well way

2112
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:03,280
more fallout but i always say fallout is more oblivion i don't know it's just it's so different

2113
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:10,720
it's like that first person it plays much more like an older pc rpg like it's more ultima than

2114
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:15,760
it is final fantasy and that's that's still a stretch i don't know what else to say you can

2115
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:19,600
punch sheep in the face that's right you can punch sheep in the face that's what i'll say

2116
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:26,080
or let loki say for me you can join guilds and rob them blind all the fun stuff you can do in

2117
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:32,160
oblivion some folks in chat are like wow oblivion's that old yeah that's the same reaction i had i was

2118
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:37,200
like shit i remember when that came out it was delayed from the original xbox launch supposed

2119
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:44,640
to be a launch title that didn't make it anyhow loki um grand theft auto it's a lot not a big

2120
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:51,920
surprise um big game series the um fourth expansion grand theft auto 4 surpassed 22 million units

2121
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:57,520
shipped and uh which brings the total for the entire franchise to 114 million units shipped

2122
02:16:57,520 --> 02:17:06,960
since 1997 that's pretty amazing and uh apparently surpassed uh san andreas uh san andreas sold 21.5

2123
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:14,960
million units um and this of course 500 000 over that now we need our grand theft auto 5 announcement

2124
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:23,120
anytime now please it'll be next year what causes i'm just let opening this wide up to you being a

2125
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:28,960
rampant fanboy but i don't care why is this game so popular why is the grand theft auto series

2126
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:36,160
do so well why is it like just such a huge important game in the industry it's basically

2127
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:41,360
you know it's you know obviously it kind of came up with the whole sandbox gameplay basically

2128
02:17:41,360 --> 02:17:46,480
people buy the gameplay because you can do whatever you want it you can drive around be

2129
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:53,360
a criminal and do all sorts of crazy stuff with cars um shooting people and then just you know

2130
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:58,960
recently with the psp and then the you know grand theft auto 4 and uh the episodes from

2131
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:04,960
liberty city and stuff you know the multiplayer has been pretty cool um not a lot of people play

2132
02:18:04,960 --> 02:18:12,400
multiplayer anymore but uh actually still quite a you know good community one it first launched and

2133
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:18,880
stuff um but i mean it's just kind of going from there and you know they also have pretty good

2134
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:23,360
storylines they go along with everything and you know their own brand of kind of parody for

2135
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:29,280
everything so i think that's why they're pretty popular um sandress especially that was a great

2136
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:34,960
game um and then of course the new one five is supposed to be kind of like at least taking place

2137
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:42,240
in sandrais again so that'll be freaking awesome all right well i got one more news story for you

2138
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:47,040

2140
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:56,480
a year and a half maybe two years to report on this story and it's not that i'm like particularly

2141
02:18:56,480 --> 02:19:03,280
the biggest fan of this game but uh this just takes me back and uh thanks to the australian

2142
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:11,520

2149
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:58,080

2150
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:06,400
uh so we don't know when the release date is but uh clearly it looks like something that's probably

2151
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:10,400
going to come out for a xbox live arcade or playstation network something downloadable

2152
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:14,960
because there already was like a sega racing game earlier this year right yeah and and i know that

2153
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:20,480
there are no announcements and as far as i'm aware no plans whatsoever to bring this game to

2154
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:25,760
uh consoles or portable systems but if you do a carmen san diego game

2155

2168
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:45,680

2170

2194
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:18,080
to feel this phone call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey it's cd thunder hey cd

2195
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:25,280
thunder what's on your mind buddy uh not much uh i want to wish low-key happy belated birthday

2196
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:31,760
thank you you're welcome um the two games i want to talk about tonight are driver san francisco

2197
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:37,200
and dead island ah some uh pretty new games that have a lot of people talking all right so tell us

2198
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:42,480
about uh we'll start with dead island what we'll start with dead island what do you want to say

2199
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:51,360
about dead island oh dead island uh it sort of reminds me of dead rising a little bit except uh

2200
02:24:51,360 --> 02:25:01,520
you were and uh the uh except the weapons once you use them for a while they are become they become

2201
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:12,080
useful they become useless and then um it's almost like an rpg because you can upgrade things but uh

2202
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:18,640
it's pretty interesting but uh so like you might have a gun in dead island and heaven forbid you

2203
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:24,400
actually run out of bullets and you can't use that gun anymore pretty much oh my gosh that's jank all

2204
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:29,600
right well i guess it makes you force you to think outside the box a little bit i mean it does is the

2205
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:35,760
game itself as artsy as that first trailer that they put out for it was or was that just like a

2206
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:42,880
thing um it's uh when you say what do you mean when you say artsy you know how like that that

2207
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:48,240
trailer that they put out had that sad little song and it was all in slow motion it was very artsy

2208
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:52,640
like the way they did it but like the game at the end of the day is a zombie first person shooter

2209
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:57,360
right or is it like did they try to class it up a bit i don't know i don't know how to explain it

2210
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:02,800
well i didn't i didn't see the trailer but it's very colorful i mean it's set

2211
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:06,880
like a general jungle setting where you have all these different apartment and condos things

2212
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:14,480
well how does it compare to other zombie games is it as good or does it suck or what well i

2213
02:26:14,480 --> 02:26:23,680
haven't actually played it but um it looks it looks really good but it um

2214
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:30,800
i think i might want to play it if i could so i just assumed that he played it that's all right

2215
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:34,160
that's right all right well what do you want to say about driver san francisco is it have you

2216
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:40,160
played driver san francisco or is this just like you want to it's uh like another one two thing

2217
02:26:40,160 --> 02:26:44,080
all right why why do you want to play driver san francisco i've actually heard a lot of good

2218
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:47,680
things about driver san francisco especially the multiplayer which is interesting because

2219
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:53,360
the last driver game i remember playing was driver 3 which was lol lol

2220
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:57,920
ah that game was fun all right what do you want to say about driver san francisco

2221
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:04,560
um one of the things i really like about it is there's parts where you your body is floating

2222
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:09,200
above the city and you go into other vehicles and it like you take over another person's body

2223
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:14,640
pretty much and when you talk it it's actually the person talking but you're making them say

2224
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:19,360
whatever you want wasn't that yeah isn't that the whole thing about driver like you get to possess

2225
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:23,840
people like that's you kind of float from car to car and like you could like possess a cop car and

2226
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:28,720
all the cliff off a cliff off a cliff that's how you want to play yeah the real one there's a

2227
02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:33,840
mission where you have to take possession of this guy and scare his driving instructor

2228
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:43,680
so he had to make his heartbeat go up to this a number of beats per second and uh he says stuff

2229
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:50,000
like oh if you stop doing this now take 20 off your next driving lessons which where there will

2230
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:55,760
be a lot of uh kevin68 in our chat says driver san francisco is actually good well then why

2231
02:27:55,760 --> 02:28:01,760
did they call it driver i'm just kidding well because you're a guy who's a cop who drives around

2232
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:07,920
doing these different things different missions so i think that's why it's called driver but

2233
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:11,760
okay because it's that same concept that's been around since because you can't get out of the car

2234
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:18,400
you're driving you're stuck in the car forever and so all right drive it off cliff and then well

2235
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:21,440
well cd thunder anything else you want to share our listeners tonight any other games you're

2236
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:28,320
looking forward to um there's one i'm really looking forward to that rise of nightmares

2237
02:28:28,320 --> 02:28:33,600
why why rise of nightmares because it i like creepy games like house of the day i know that

2238
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:42,400
type of thing and uh so i'm thinking you're kind of a zombie fan yeah a little bit not completely

2239
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:51,600
all right and uh so i've only seen parts of it but it it's not actually that scary might scare

2240
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:58,400
other people but it's got very creepy atmospheres all right incredibly gory well before we let you

2241
02:28:58,400 --> 02:29:01,920
go cd thunder i've gotta i gotta let you go so we can get more calls but we have folks in chat

2245
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:28,160

2247
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:40,240

2248
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:44,560
it's going you know what that's probably a good thing then so all right let's get back to the

2249
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:49,600
that's probably a good thing then so i at least that's what i've heard uh i haven't seen the

2256
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:24,320
someone else unfortunately say he's probably gonna have a license for the avengers game and it'll be

2257
02:30:24,320 --> 02:30:29,120
a crappy brawler beat him up like the other games have been actually i would really like for them to

hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's me hi me what would the listeners rather know you

2269
02:31:27,440 --> 02:31:35,200
as oh whatever miklatau shane hi miklatau shane whatever what about shane latov yeah shane latov

2270
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:41,520
what'd you call in to talk about tonight shane latov um i called in to talk about how awesome

2271
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:48,240
neo wiz is and they released tap sonic this week on the iphone or ios and it's really really fun

2272
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:52,640
and yeah i forgot to talk about that game i downloaded that on iphone it's it's it's neat

2273
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:57,680
what neo wiz what else do they make because you said they're awesome dj max oh i didn't realize

2274
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:02,640
the same company they're partially responsible for that that's why you see a lot of dj max songs when

2275
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:10,240
you're actually playing taps on it where the free song is like the end song from dj max 2 i just

2276
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:15,680
thought it was because they were both korean games i don't know no that would be cool though if all

2277
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:22,560
the korean games got together and made it like some uber game like you like losing in dj max or

2278
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:30,560
something awesome and pump it up i don't know sure sure um uh tell tell the listeners about

2279
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:35,200
this game a little bit for those have no idea what tap sonic is because it was a the game is free

2280
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:39,440
to check out sort of there's there's microtransactions at the butt in the game right

2281
02:32:39,440 --> 02:32:46,240
and you if you want to play like for real you have to use those microtransactions um because

2282
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:53,280
as i was unaware when you spend like if you were one of the first i think it was 1000 people that

2283
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:59,920
downloaded it you got 300 million points and use those music points to purchase songs or so i

2284
02:32:59,920 --> 02:33:05,360
thought you actually use those music points to play songs and you do not get to keep those songs

2285
02:33:05,360 --> 02:33:10,960
once you spend the money on them so every time you play a song you're spending points so it's

2286
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:16,800
awesome i go back later i can just get a preview because i'm not a point wow that's kind of shitty

2287
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:22,640
though i gotta say i don't like that but i noticed the free songs rotate cheaper what's that

2288
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:29,920
i said i'd be okay with it if it was cheaper i guess the korean version like our rates for

2289
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:35,520
song purchases are like four times what they are in korea so we're really getting screwed here

2290
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:39,360
that's a little ridiculous i can't recommend it past the free songs for that but it's worth to

2291
02:33:39,360 --> 02:33:43,520
check out the free version for the free songs the free songs rotate that's one thing i noticed like

2292
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:48,080
i had a song show up the first day that i wanted to play again and it was and now it was a pay song

2293
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:52,960
and a different song had showed up instead so i think they rotate a little bit oh really yeah i

2294
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:56,800
haven't noticed that yet i've only seen the same free song go back in and look because one of the

2295
02:33:56,800 --> 02:34:03,280
songs i played the first day was suddenly a pay song it was weird so um i'll probably do that but

2296
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:07,840
the game itself the game itself it's like it's kind of like beatmania with the or guitar hero

2297
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:12,160
with the falling notes and you have to tap on the bottom of the screen what i think is really cool

2298
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:17,680
for ios is that there's certain notes that you tap hold and drag which i thought was kind of neat

2299
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:25,520
it kind of looks like a sound voltex if if you're following konami games in a way because it's got

2300
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:33,920
that guitar hero hallway style notes falling at you and well yes that's really about it and it's

2301
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:39,440
musical uh so would you recommend people check out tap sonic or no it's too damn expensive even

2302
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:44,480
though it's free to at least know it promotes our songs awesome i would i would say download the

2303
02:34:44,480 --> 02:34:49,920
free thing if you like it and you want to spend money on it go ahead it's not like you're paying

2304
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:55,760
30 bucks to play three songs or something like that if you buy the points you know you probably

2305
02:34:55,760 --> 02:35:01,920
get a good week's worth of play time if you don't play it like for hours and hours and hours on end

2306
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:09,760
so it's not so bad all right well any other games you want to mention um i don't think so i don't

2307
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:15,360
remember i only called to talk about that since you failed to all right well my i'm sorry so just

on your mind not too much i just you know thought i'd call in the first night i'm listening to the

2324
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:06,560
podcast and uh really loving it uh great job so far thank you very much appreciate it what's on

2325
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:10,080
your mind what do you think of the stories we've been talking about tonight oh the stories that

2326
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:14,400
have been great and i mean you know it's it's awesome you know kind of watching and listening

2327
02:37:14,400 --> 02:37:20,480
to the conversation sort of moving uh from side to side top of the top and kind of going all over

2328
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:25,200
the place i find it's really laid back i'm really impressed and i'm really excited to be able to

2329
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:29,600
ask what the setup you guys have going on here well thank you so much well it's almost like he

2330
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:34,320
called just to inflate our egos tonight and i really appreciate that i already have a headache

2331
02:37:34,320 --> 02:37:40,480
because my skull's not big enough to hold all of my ego well no it is and i think hopefully go

2332
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:45,840
ahead hopefully it's not gonna you know get too much larger than the studio this isn't a very big

2333
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:51,840
room um yeah i know right uh i think it's important to note if if folks have only ever

2334
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:55,840
listened to the podcast feed and never never joined us for a live show the chat room is a

2335
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:58,960
lot of fun and even on a night like tonight where it's kind of a smaller turnout in chat

2336
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:06,400
than it usually is stupid emmys yeah stupid emmys uh they the the top topic will sometimes be about

2337
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:10,720
the show but then it kind of goes into these related topics and lots of links and fun things

2338
02:38:10,720 --> 02:38:16,000
to look at it's almost like its own little stumble upon or tumblr exactly it's kind of like a domino

2339
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:22,960
effect of just sheer awesomeness absolutely in fact right now somebody is asking for the nyan cat

2340
02:38:22,960 --> 02:38:28,240
video so i said i would uh well relink that to me robin i'll put it on the tumblr because we're

2341
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:32,480
putting stuff on the tumblr now oh of course of course hold on so that people will visit our

2342
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:38,640
tumblr there you go all right you get both well what do you think about 3ds versus vita cinder

2343
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:42,320
wolf since that's one of the big topics we got into tonight are you a 3ds owner by chance

2344
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:47,760
uh actually i'm not an owner of the 3ds i've had the pleasure of playing with it a few times for

2345
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:53,760
uh you know colleagues co-workers down at the office uh really liking it um i do love the option

2346
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:59,440
of you know the intensity adjusting the intensity of the 3d feature uh just so just because it's

2347
02:38:59,440 --> 02:39:04,480
accommodating to everybody you know the people that typically you know suffer from things like

2348
02:39:04,480 --> 02:39:10,400
headaches or migraines with the 3d technology uh so nintendo definitely made a great choice in uh

2349
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:17,360
not in that intensity feature you can go from like super gigantic headache to just minor headache to

2350
02:39:17,360 --> 02:39:23,600
like to like slurp even like i drink i was just saying to going from like migraine headaches to

2351
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:30,320
i drank a slurpy too fast headache you know that type of thing exactly so well what about the vita

2352
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:34,560
though because the vita's coming out pretty soon if you are i don't know if you're a psp owner or

2353
02:39:34,560 --> 02:39:39,040
if you're into sony stuff what do you think about what sony's doing over there well i i don't know

2354
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:44,880
i well i i do like sony uh sony's hardware so and even sony's gaming repertoire but i'm not

2355
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:49,920
particularly a fan of uh their marketing mode i mean they tend to wait for the competition to see

2356
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:56,720
what they can improve on and that's always a great strategy but i find that uh because they're not

2357
02:39:56,720 --> 02:40:02,400
trying to stay ahead uh in the push everything out first mode i think they're losing a lot of

2358
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:08,960
the possible potential fan base uh because you know what i mentioned earlier in the in the chat room

2359
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:15,760
was that sony waited for microsoft to launch their 360 console and now worldwide there have

2360
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:21,520
been more 360 consoles sold than the sony playstation 3's uh xbox seems to have that

2361
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:28,480
much wider game repertoire to kind of cater to sort of all game or all gamers uh of all ages

2362
02:40:28,480 --> 02:40:36,320
except in japan teen and adults except in japan well yeah that i suppose that is kind of true

2363
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:44,880
but uh i i find that that you know comparing the 360 repertoire to the playstation um you know

2364
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:51,040
there really are maybe only five or six games uh so far i say for the ps3 for example i'm really

2365
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:56,160
interested in that i haven't had a chance to play yet uh but you know it seems like microsoft is

2366
02:40:56,160 --> 02:41:02,880
hawking you know a new game every week that seemed to be catching my attention too um

2367
02:41:04,160 --> 02:41:10,240
it'll be similar with the uh the vita all right well we'll see we'll see what kind of develops

2368
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:13,840
especially as we start to hear more about the north american launch because you know we've

2369
02:41:13,840 --> 02:41:17,360
heard a lot about the japanese launch but just because certain games are coming out at launch

2370
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:21,120
over there doesn't mean the launch window games are going to be the same it's going to be very

2371
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:25,360
interesting to see what happens with that um let me ask you one other quick question since you are

2372
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:32,080
a first time caller of the show what was that sure oh okay um i always ask this of listeners

2373
02:41:32,080 --> 02:41:36,560
this kind of helps me understand what what kind of a gamer our listeners are what would you say

2374
02:41:36,560 --> 02:41:40,960
is your favorite video game of all time or if you're having trouble picking just one one of

2375
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:49,520
your favorite video games of all time um favorite game of all time right now uh it's an old game i

2376
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:55,520
think was released back in 1990 on the turbo graphics 16 console by nec it was called

2377
02:41:55,520 --> 02:42:02,480
newtopia 2 um it was sort of nec in hunts and soft's attempt at a zelda killer uh the

2378
02:42:02,480 --> 02:42:07,520
turbo graphics released a year before the super nintendo console um and it really has a lot of the

2379
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:13,920
traditional rpg elements in it like the old zelda games um you know great soundtrack too even more

2380
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:20,560
so than uh say the old zelda games and i don't know i just i find it fun a fun run right from

2381
02:42:20,560 --> 02:42:25,200
start to finish uh you can do it in you know a handful of hours you know five six hours but it's

2382
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:29,600
just very addicting at fun i absolutely remember the newtopia series haven't you covered that on

2383
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:33,520
the show before dark sucker i could be wrong but i have indeed covered newtopia so yeah it's a good

2384
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:38,400
good uh good times so one of the one of the highlights of the turbo graphics 16 so you i

2385
02:42:38,400 --> 02:42:42,720
think you brought up turbo graphics in chat earlier so you must have been a big big fan

2386
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:48,240
many years ago uh actually i did see growing up uh my family you know we didn't have the

2387
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:52,640
standard nintendo receiver nintendo console uh dad had the old calico vision and ataris and then

2388
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:57,920
we jumped right into the the turbo graphics uh moments for the deal so i kind of grew up playing

2389
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:02,400
a lot of that uh and actually had the pleasure of finding one in a flea market about three years ago

2390
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:12,480
so it's soaked up to the hdtv nice have you had a duo no i haven't actually i've wanted to

2391
02:43:12,480 --> 02:43:17,440
find one but uh you know other costs and other bills kind of trumping that right now well i can

2392
02:43:17,440 --> 02:43:21,280
tell you i can tell you right now if you're looking to play any of the imports that uh

2393
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:26,880
it actually is gonna it was we had a like some converter but the converters hardly ever work

2394
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:32,800
um you can get the core graphics really cheap the pc engine yeah that is true yeah and i mean

2395
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:37,840
although i do like the idea of the duo um my it's kind of funny my little brother back home actually

2396
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:44,560
hooked me up with uh a lot of the old roms and emulators actually that i can just you know i

2397
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:51,040
play on my own time here it's a magic engine uh yes actually oh the ma i i use the magic

2398
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:56,640
and actually for all the turbo graphics uh games that are out there so far so cool well you have

2399
02:43:56,640 --> 02:44:01,440
a fan in chat because game guru says utopia is awesome utopia is pretty cool yeah it's a good

2403
02:44:16,080 --> 02:44:21,760
school gamer than myself he's constantly talking about the older titles that he's finding uh

2404
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:26,320

2427
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:32,640
and he usually sends good stuff so what the heck let's do this one it's a a mod that he sent us

2428
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:39,200
it's super pixel brothers i guess what is this it's a it's a playable super mario brothers

2429
02:46:39,200 --> 02:46:47,840
but it's only 64 pixels i guess it's an eight by eight led board that does super mario brothers but

2430
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:53,440
i can't imagine this at all looks pretty like it's gotta be terrible let's see i want to see what

2431
02:46:53,440 --> 02:46:59,520
this looks like here so i'm trying to load up the video in chat but it's it's um here we go there

2432
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:07,360
we go guys oh my gosh he's playing blocks and under certain blocks and i've actually made it

2433
02:47:07,360 --> 02:47:12,080
random oh he's got a nice accent i'm gonna try this out five points whereas just normal blocks to get

2434
02:47:12,080 --> 02:47:19,280
to now another feature i've added is five different colored blocks yeah so if i can

2435
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:24,240
explain to you guys i don't think it's literally the nintendo rom like but it looks like somebody

2436
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:31,760
made their own version of it on this like imagine like one of those old school led games where

2437
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:37,200
there's only so many places you can have a cutout and he's it's basically these colored lights and

2438
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:42,480
the little mario is like an orange square that kind of goes around and you can break blocks and

2439
02:47:42,480 --> 02:47:47,680
jump on top of things i gotta say this is much more impressive than what i was thinking it was

2440
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:53,440
gonna look like and these levels are it's sad i recognize these levels based off of the real game

2441
02:47:54,160 --> 02:47:59,520
it's been translated really well a website run by enl so that's i gotta say that's pretty cool

2442
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:06,400
yeah not bad so i guess uh dark sakura i got one more link for you okay so why don't you go uh

2446
02:48:22,480 --> 02:48:30,480

2447
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:38,400
