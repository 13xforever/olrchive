00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:26,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight, September 18, 2011, Nintendo reveals the future of the 3DS and its pink, the PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch, and Sony adds a controversial new section to the PSN Terms of Service.

2
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:39,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:51,245
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining you live here on this September 18th, 2011 for episode number 428 with my co-host, first off, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

4
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,626
[SPEAKER_10]: We're also the show where every gamer has access to chicken.

5
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:55,186
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have some if you want.

6
00:00:55,627 --> 00:00:56,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, yes.

7
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:57,508
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's eating chicken.

8
00:00:57,828 --> 00:01:01,049
[SPEAKER_04]: TechMasterLoki is in the house over here as well and he's eating chicken.

9
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:01,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

10
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,611
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am chicken-less, but I do have... You can have some chicken.

11
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,411
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's okay.

12
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:06,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually don't really want chicken.

13
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:08,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a pumpkin spice frappuccino.

14
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:09,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm good.

15
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:10,935
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a pumpkin spice latte.

16
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:14,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I had one of those brunches that was so big, like I'm still full.

17
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:16,699
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just like, I'm not even hungry.

18
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:17,340
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird.

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't explain it.

20
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:19,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

21
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:20,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

22
00:01:21,063 --> 00:01:23,885
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, I'm still laughing my ass off over that cracked article.

23
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:26,212
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this article you were reading about?

24
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:30,395
[SPEAKER_10]: It was one of those little Photoshop things where they do rejected book covers.

25
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:33,897
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of them was, it's okay to be a douchebag by Ayn Rand.

26
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:38,000
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting about that website is they have really made, you know, I'm not knocking it.

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,340
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just what I've noticed about them.

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,241
[SPEAKER_04]: An observation, if you will.

29
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:42,663
[SPEAKER_04]: They really seem to have made a name for themselves.

30
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:44,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I always thought, wasn't Cracked like a magazine?

31
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:46,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the answer to Mad Magazine like 20 years ago?

32
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:48,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was Mad Magazine and Light.

33
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:49,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that still exist?

34
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:50,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Cracked Magazine?

35
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:51,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.

36
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:58,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Cracked is on Dig and those websites all the time because they specialize in top 10 lists or something like that.

37
00:01:58,775 --> 00:01:59,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's awesome.

38
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:01,057
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all they do is lists.

39
00:02:01,518 --> 00:02:02,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to do one for them.

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they take user-submitted articles?

41
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:10,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they do, but the better that they are, they'll start paying you for them or something.

42
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:11,387
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

43
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:11,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, cool.

44
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:13,108
[SPEAKER_04]: New industry for you.

45

46
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:29,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, to be fair, Bobby had the night off tonight.

47
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:57,984

48
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:05,989

[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of the shmemies

51
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick Arcade Video Game TV Shows

52
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:41,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I was, um, I watched that one, and I can never remember the name of it, where, um, they would send the team through this, like, labyrinth with, uh, these Velcro vests, and they would attach the prizes to their vests as they went along.

53
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:43,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I vaguely remember that, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:47,734
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was on Saturday morning after my cartoons, so I would watch it all the time.

55
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:48,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

56
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:53,276
[SPEAKER_10]: and I was like, you can't stick a TurboGrafx to your front, put it on your back.

57
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:55,057
[SPEAKER_04]: They were empty boxes probably.

58
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just all props or something like that.

59
00:04:56,778 --> 00:04:59,418
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, they'd grab games and stuff and it was pretty cool.

60
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

61
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:02,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember the name of it.

62
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:03,220
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, um...

63
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Outro Music

64
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:28,130
[SPEAKER_04]: The Biggest Loser is his thing.

65
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:30,233
[SPEAKER_04]: How appropriate for him.

66
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:33,576
[SPEAKER_10]: There was another show that was on too that he switched.

67
00:05:33,596 --> 00:05:35,178
[SPEAKER_04]: He will always be Funhaus to me.

68
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:36,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, okay?

69
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:36,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was.

70
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,040
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't Funhaus.

71
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Funhaus was like the double dare turned up to 11.

72
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:48,238
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was also, well, you remember that show, what was it, The Quest of the Kingdom or something?

73
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:51,299
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's not one of the thing of, there's another guy who had brown hair.

74
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,260
[SPEAKER_10]: He'd always wear like a members only jacket.

75
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:55,461
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the 80s.

76
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that John Davidson?

77
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:59,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't he on Hollywood Squares?

78
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:03,344
[SPEAKER_10]: He sat in a chair that looked a lot like Captain Kirk's chair.

79
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:19,757
[SPEAKER_10]: and I remember this show very much because they did a big special on the Neo Geo and about taking the cards and switching them out you know putting them in the machine saving your game and coming home and playing it at home and for the life of me I cannot remember what the name of the show was

80
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:27,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask this question while you guys try to think of the show or while the chatters at chat.arnstalksradio.com shout it out.

81
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:33,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it that video game television hasn't really seemed to work?

82
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,257
[SPEAKER_04]: There has been a few exceptions.

83
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:37,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some of you guys dig X-Play.

84
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:42,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's that show on Spike TV that gets to break a lot of exclusives, the one that Jeff Keighley does.

85
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:52,331
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a few things here and there but G4 TV was supposed to be all about video games but it didn't work because it went this whole different direction where it's aimed towards young guys.

86
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:58,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just that we're too busy wanting to play video games than watch people talk about it on the TV?

87
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:00,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Why doesn't it work?

88
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:02,639
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

89
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:28,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Internet's faster than TV or print media.

90
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:29,363
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the way it is.

91
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:32,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless they're breaking news, that's kind of the way it goes.

92
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:34,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm positive one of them was video power.

93
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:37,146
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a story coming up later tonight.

94
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:43,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to totally get into it now, but one of the big consoles is launching a TV-related thing, and we'll talk more about that later.

95
00:07:45,109 --> 00:08:08,460
[SPEAKER_04]: but that does kind of seem to be like the future especially when we talk a lot about like video on demand and how huge Netflix and Hulu and all that stuff has been on PlayStation as well as Xbox and do you think it's possible that as these consoles become more like entertainment devices like almost for some people maybe replacing cable someday I don't know do you think we'll see more gaming related content on those consoles?

96
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:14,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, if it's on a console, I can imagine that they're going to try to put some gaming-related content on there.

97
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,282
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll probably feel like infomercials more than anything.

98
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:21,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like the Majors Minute on Xbox 360.

99
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:26,709
[SPEAKER_04]: As nice as that is, let's be real, it's just a product awareness thing for Microsoft, right?

100
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:36,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to find... There was an article I saw talking about some new video game show that's coming and it was by the guy that did The Room or something like that.

101
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:40,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Silent Hill The Room, but actually... Like the horrible cult movie The Room?

102
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:42,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the horrible cult movie.

103
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,320
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually him.

104
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks so fucking terrible.

105
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:47,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't remember what it's called.

106
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:49,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it's parody or it's a joke or something.

107
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:51,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's something to take too seriously.

108
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I am your something interest.

109
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:54,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what it was.

110
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:55,225
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just retarded.

111
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:59,887
[SPEAKER_10]: For the record, both shows I was thinking of is actually the same show but different seasons of it.

112
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:02,348
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Video Power?

113
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:05,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Video Power because it started off as like a tip show and then it became a game show.

114
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

115
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:06,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that one.

116
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was like a game show.

117
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,211
[SPEAKER_04]: It had tips.

118
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:08,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

119
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:09,244
1990-92

120
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:33,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, was it really?

121
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:35,658
[SPEAKER_10]: In two different formats from 1990 through 92.

122
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:37,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, I'm with Dan in the other room.

123
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was way earlier than that.

124
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:42,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Wikipedia is always right 100% of the time, right?

125
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:43,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Presented by Stevie Poskoski.

126
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:45,627
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to double check IMDB.

127
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:48,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me hit on this.

128
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to mention this.

129
00:09:50,691 --> 00:10:00,479
[SPEAKER_04]: You know one thing that I think would have made an awesome television show would have been the 1 vs. 100 on Xbox 360.

130
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I really feel like Microsoft was sitting on a goldmine with that and they let it go.

131
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:08,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's because of licensing reasons or what have you, but

132
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:12,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I know so many people that were so into that, and it's really weird that they let it go.

133
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:20,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really made me think, like, why hasn't, like, Game Show Network tried to pick up, like, an actual game show that runs through consoles or something?

134
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:20,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

135
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:21,648
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I found it.

136
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:27,250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the Tommy Wee Show, and it's featuring Tommy Wiseau.

137
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, it's supposed to be this weird...

138
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:32,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

139
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:50,238
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying it's going to be presented by Makima, and it basically follows him as he repeatedly gets abducted by different races of mysterious aliens transported to distant planets where he's forced to test popular video games.

140
00:10:51,019 --> 00:11:00,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a terrible idea ripped off of Mystery Science Theater 3000 with this guy that looks like he's the Undertaker or something like that.

141
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:01,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just ridiculous.

142
00:11:01,605 --> 00:11:01,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

143
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:02,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guess what?

144
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:05,207
[SPEAKER_04]: No one cares.

145
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:07,046
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

146
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:42,247
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get into our gaming weeks here in a minute, but one other game-slash-TV-related thing that I can think of that I know is coming soon is the whole sci-fi TV show that's supposed to be tied into an MMO.

147
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:44,068
[SPEAKER_04]: It popped in my head.

148
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:45,448
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something I think they had talked about at E3.

149
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:47,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember anything about that, Loki?

150
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:50,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're talking about, but I don't know what the hell it's called, and nor do I care.

151
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sci-fi show.

152
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:53,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

153
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:55,872
[SPEAKER_03]: X-Play

154
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: um what was the other one that was yeah Portal was kind of lame they had that on there um

155
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:41,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Just watch all the online reviews now.

156
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:45,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, where he'd go running around in MMOs.

157
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:47,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that the one that Wil Wheaton hosted?

158
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:48,100
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

159
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I just really watch YouTube like the angry video game nerd and, you know, crap.

160
00:12:56,423 --> 00:13:00,225
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that other one that you watch?

161
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:01,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Classic Game Room.

162
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:01,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's it.

163
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:04,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's turning to YouTube now and amateur programming.

164
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:09,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Such as the show you're listening to right now, although we're more radio than TV, but hey.

165
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,525
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a YouTube channel, we just don't really do anything with it.

166
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:13,346
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

167
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:19,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I use mine to post videos of Shermie and my best friend's son.

168
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:23,116
[SPEAKER_03]: My post-grant, I thought, are related videos.

169
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:28,663
[SPEAKER_03]: and one video that I had to upload a trailer so I can link it on a newsletter I was doing.

170
00:13:29,163 --> 00:13:35,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny enough, that trailer got more comments than most of my other videos I put on there because it's some really crappy hunting game.

171
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know what?

172
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if it sucks.

173
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:41,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to put the trailer up there.

174
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:46,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiger Claw mentioned something about a Gunstringer game that was put out by Troma.

175
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:48,199
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what Troma did, right?

176
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Toxic Avenger movies?

177
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:55,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, they do all the really campy B-movie stuff, like Troma and Juliet and stuff, right?

178
00:13:55,182 --> 00:14:02,985
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that Sars, what's his name from Troma, Lloyd McCoffman or whatever, he's in there.

179
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:03,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

180
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,260
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

181
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop trying to get into stories that we make up for later on, bastard.

182
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:12,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

183
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:12,901
[SPEAKER_03]: You listen.

184
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:14,002
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't control the show.

185
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,282
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

186
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:15,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

187
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:17,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we're even talking about that tonight.

188
00:14:17,642 --> 00:14:18,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

189
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:19,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about our gaming week.

190
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:23,324
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always like to start off the show talking about what kind of games we've been playing this week.

191
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,624
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

192
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:25,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

193
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:28,465
[SPEAKER_04]: As in the worlds of Warcraft?

194
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:29,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

195
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:29,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd.

196
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:31,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you're a nerd.

197
00:14:31,465 --> 00:14:32,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, get a life.

198
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:32,946
[SPEAKER_10]: And Sims.

199
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:33,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing Sims 3.

200
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:34,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

201
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:37,360
[SPEAKER_10]: and I played some Tiny Tower.

202
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:39,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

203
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:42,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, these are all the same games I play, but I like to make them.

204
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:44,007
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played Espagaluda.

205
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:46,349
[SPEAKER_10]: I can never say it.

206
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:50,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Espagaluda 2 on my phone.

207
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:52,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you check out Radiant Silvergun on Xbox yet?

208
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:53,356
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems like something that would be up your alley.

209
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:54,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that came out this week.

210
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:55,278
[SPEAKER_10]: We've already got like

211
00:14:56,837 --> 00:14:59,898
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't you want to see the super uber HD version prettiness?

212
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:02,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that we got it yet, now that I think about it.

213
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:05,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was thinking of you when I saw that on Xbox Live the other day.

214
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:05,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh.

215
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to play the crap out of that.

216
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was actually going to sit down and play some Symphony of the Night today, but I've had a bad headache for most of the day.

217
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn Dracula causing those migraines.

218
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:17,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

219
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:18,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn him.

220
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:22,863
[SPEAKER_10]: It is not by my hand that I was once again given my migraine.

221
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:25,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

222
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:26,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It was alright.

223
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:28,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't really play a whole lot of stuff.

224
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:30,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly just three things.

225
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:33,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon, played lots of that.

226
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:38,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have my jet guy now almost level 7.

227
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:49,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And Grand Theft Auto, we went back to Lost and Damned again because they got tired of getting punked in Battle of the Gay Tonys, so now they're getting punked in Lost and Damned.

228
00:15:51,062 --> 00:15:52,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Mixing it up a bit, I guess.

229
00:15:53,685 --> 00:16:01,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then I played Zelda on, um, Virtual Console on the 3DS, so I've been playing that right now.

230
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:05,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on the fifth dungeon, and, um...

231
00:16:07,838 --> 00:16:08,279
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.

232
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,485
[SPEAKER_03]: The virtual console stuff is alright, but it does make you realize one thing, and I don't know if anyone's really covered it before.

233
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:16,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they have.

234
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:25,595
[SPEAKER_03]: But, man, that D-pad... I mean, Nintendo is known for pretty good D-pads, especially with the NES and stuff like that.

235
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:29,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Great D-pad work, I think, pretty flawlessly.

236
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:29,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

237
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:59,092
[SPEAKER_03]: but that d-pad on that 3DS is terrible and that what are they calling it now the circle pad or whatever not good either so it's just kind of like okay which terrible control method do I want to use so I end up using the circle pad for most things but it is not not good at all aside from that though the emulation is good it's just that d-pad is terrible but no d-pad looked good the one with Vita

238
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a lot of neat looking things about the Vita, I gotta say.

239
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,089
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess we'll get into that a little later.

240
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's lots and lots of news about handhelds.

241
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:07,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, this is like handheld week.

242
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:09,473
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons and tons of news about both.

243
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:10,814
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get into that a little later.

244
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:11,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it for your gaming week?

245
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:12,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like it.

246
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:12,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

247
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:17,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my gaming week was mostly uneventful.

248
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a lot of the same stuff like WoW and so forth too.

249
00:17:19,702 --> 00:17:22,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to really talk myself down from buying Magicka on Steam today.

250
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:24,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Although the game looks kind of fun.

251
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I might still buy it when I get home.

252
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:26,648
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like...

253
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:51,770
[SPEAKER_04]: only like nine bucks for the uber edition right now on Steam or you can get like the buy four copies of the game for seven dollars and like it's it's some obscene sale going on on Steam right now and man I love and I hate Steam you know what I mean like I love that I'm getting so many games super cheap I hate that I'm keep spending money on games I'll play like once or twice and then it'd be all like oh I gotta go back to WoW

254
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,032
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as other games I've been playing, I've been playing more L.A.

255
00:17:55,072 --> 00:18:07,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire on the consoles, did a couple other cases and so forth, and found that I'm really horrible at the action sequences, and I'm so thankful that the developers decided to put in a way you can just skip the action sequences, because I just wasn't getting it.

256
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

257
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,323
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of one of the cases, you finally figure out who the suspect really is, and the suspect just bolts.

258
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,464
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

259
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:37,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

260
00:18:56,081 --> 00:19:04,724
[SPEAKER_04]: because the thing I like best about that game is going to look at the clues and going to investigate the suspects or excuse me, interrogate the suspects and put that all together.

261
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:05,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And investigating.

262
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:11,287
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like, you know, like putting together the pieces of a logic puzzle or something.

263
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:16,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's amazing how exhilarating or how frustrating it can be when you hit the button.

264
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:19,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I literally sit there and it's like being on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

265
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,231
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, your final answer is truth.

266
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:25,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it goes, do, do, do.

267
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:25,912
Fuck!

268
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:28,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew the bitch was lying.

269
00:19:28,956 --> 00:19:35,322
[SPEAKER_03]: They just have a casual mode in there where you pull back a slingshot and launch a bird at the guy.

270
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:43,671
[SPEAKER_04]: But I gotta say, as far as Rockstar Game goes, I don't usually get into the Grand Theft Auto games and all that stuff, but I'm really liking L.A.

271
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:44,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Noire.

272
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:48,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the detective thing, and I'm all into the stories and the 40s stuff, so...

273
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:51,577
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I'm going to play some more of that one.

274
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:52,398
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.

275
00:19:52,698 --> 00:19:56,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments on Magicka in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

276
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:00,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Infinel, I hope I said that right, says Magicka is crazy fun.

277
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:04,005
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kaijudo says Magicka is crazy lag for me.

278
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:06,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure they fix that lag before you buy.

279
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if that's for everybody or if it's like a system-related thing.

280
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:10,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

281
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:11,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

282
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:31,440
[SPEAKER_04]: so yeah I've been playing that now there's another game I've been playing quite a bit of this week and I didn't know if I wanted to talk about it on the show tonight because I'm gonna kind of like open Pandora's box here by saying what I've been playing but I figure what the hell I'm not gonna be here the next two weeks anyway so if any hate mail comes in I wouldn't see it anyway

283
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you've listened to the show for any length of time, I told you guys I don't pirate games.

284
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't download a lot of games.

285
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:39,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't pirate games.

286
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:44,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Except I have downloaded in the past, like during the PlayStation 1 era, I downloaded a lot of the Bomani games.

287
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:46,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to bring you something.

288
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:48,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to bring you President Cat.

289
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:50,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot both things.

290
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,021
[SPEAKER_04]: That's different.

291
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,602
[SPEAKER_04]: That's different.

292
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:59,128
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was going to play the – you used to back in the day I would download – because I'm not paying $80 to import all these games.

293
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:03,592
[SPEAKER_04]: My mindset is if you want my money, release the game in my territory and I'll buy it.

294
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:06,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenoblade Chronicles Xenoblade Chronicles

295
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

296
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it something the Wii needs on its system?

297
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:24,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

298
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,892
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the honest reaction I had playing Xenoblade Chronicles.

299
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:33,193
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing out of my mouth, because Salacious Pop, you know, I was sitting down playing it for a couple hours, and Salacious Pop goes, well, how was it?

300
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:34,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, you know what?

301
00:21:35,514 --> 00:21:39,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like a really, really awesome PlayStation 2 game.

302
00:21:40,945 --> 00:22:01,497
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's kind of how I felt about it is that the graphics really not up to par with what you see on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 which you know is understandable it's the Wii the game itself feels a lot like I don't know it's kind of like Final Fantasy 12 with MMO elements and a pretty neat battle system reminiscent of the other you know Xeno games so

303
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:03,879
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot to do in the game.

304
00:22:03,979 --> 00:22:05,120
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of quests.

305
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,062
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of things you can do in the game.

306
00:22:07,082 --> 00:22:08,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And the world is vast.

307
00:22:08,623 --> 00:22:10,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really something else.

308
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:17,231
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're an RPG fan, you really have a right to be mad that they're not putting the game out here.

309
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:20,553
[SPEAKER_04]: And quite frankly, if they're not going to put it out here, you should do what I did.

310
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:22,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't miss out on a great game.

311
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:26,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I know I might get hate mail for encouraging that, but you know what?

312
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I will happily buy this game when they release it in this country.

313
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:32,843
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

314
00:22:33,523 --> 00:22:34,724
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to mod our Wii.

315
00:22:55,288 --> 00:23:10,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Really easily being adapted for the Wii U There's a lot, like the menu system There's a lot to it, there's a lot of subscreens You could use that second device The little controller, very easily To do a lot of that, and then you could have The really nice souped up graphics And to be honest, if Nintendo

316
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:14,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Enchanted Arms was the only remote RPG available for like six months.

317
00:23:14,598 --> 00:23:14,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Oblivion?

318
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:34,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, but I'm thinking Japanese RPG.

319
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:41,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not thinking... There's a big difference in my mind between a game like Final Fantasy, Enchanted Arms, Xenoblade, and Oblivion.

320
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:43,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Oblivion's its own thing.

321
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:45,577
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you're right, you're right.

322
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:48,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Oblivion is a pretty kick-ass RPG launch title.

323
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:49,860
[SPEAKER_03]: No, here's what they're gonna do.

324
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

325
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, this is Nintendo.

326
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:54,666
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I can see them doing that because you know what?

327
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:59,333
[SPEAKER_03]: They have nothing to bring to the table right now for the Wii U. They've got nothing.

328
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:06,363
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can't hold back Zelda Skyward Sword any longer because people will just be really pissed off then.

329
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:08,604
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's what they're going to do.

330
00:24:09,104 --> 00:24:11,885
[SPEAKER_03]: All they're going to do is they're going to fucking upscale that shit.

331
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:13,606
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to redo the graphics.

332
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:16,826
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to upscale the polygons, and you're going to have low-res textures.

333
00:24:18,287 --> 00:24:24,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you've seen with the Metal Gear Solid HD collection, there's different ways that they do HD.

334
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:27,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them, they'll actually go to the Microsoft website.

335
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:28,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

336
00:24:50,612 --> 00:24:51,672
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all they're going to fucking do.

337
00:24:51,912 --> 00:24:55,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to maybe add some support for the Wii U tablet thing.

338
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:56,974
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

339
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:59,035
[SPEAKER_03]: People will be like, Oh my God, that's amazing.

340
00:24:59,075 --> 00:24:59,555
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

341
00:24:59,835 --> 00:25:00,755
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what they're doing.

342
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:08,978
[SPEAKER_03]: They're holding out so that they go, Look it, we understand what the hardcore fan wants and we brought it to you with the Wii U and you're supposed to go...

343
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, Nintendo, my savior!

344
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:13,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go buy your system now!

345
00:25:13,783 --> 00:25:29,021
[SPEAKER_03]: But you need to see through this shit and you say, fuck them, they're just trying to hold this little carrot in front of my nose so I buy another fucking system that they end up catering to the goddamn masses for and make all these casual games and completely forget about the hardcore user that actually buys product for their damn system.

346
00:25:29,437 --> 00:25:51,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing though like I agree and I don't because the thing is at the end of the day it's not just about the graphics and the game itself is pretty freaking awesome especially like if you like JRPGs at all or you like these kind of like you know very open world do the side quests and battles in real time without going into cut scenes for battle and all this.

347
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,091
[SPEAKER_04]: The presentation of the game is great.

348
00:25:53,171 --> 00:25:57,114
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game itself, story and everything, is pretty awesome.

349
00:25:57,594 --> 00:26:06,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they need to do... I mean, the graphics do look dated, but even up-rezzing or whatever little tweaks they can make to it that bring it a bump up, I think it's okay.

350
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:09,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Because at the end of the day, the game itself speaks for itself.

351
00:26:10,165 --> 00:26:12,207
[SPEAKER_04]: System is only as good as the games that are on it.

352
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:12,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

353
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:19,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then if that's the way they want to go, they want to bring it out over here and they need to bring it out on the Wii like it is now because it's done.

354
00:26:19,442 --> 00:26:28,106
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be put out now and then they can do a special edition later on that has better graphics or an HD version and that would come out like a year later.

355
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:29,106
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the problem with that?

356
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:31,267
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to sell it twice and people may buy it twice.

357
00:26:31,994 --> 00:26:44,321
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is, and I'm just being real with y'all here, the more Nintendo, I feel like they're ignoring the type of game that I want to play, the more it makes me want to turn to the dark side to do it.

358
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:51,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And how easy was it to do when major gaming websites are posting, here's how to play Xenoblade in the US.

359
00:26:51,645 --> 00:26:53,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Nintendo is just being fucking deaf.

360
00:26:54,546 --> 00:27:22,852
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's fine if their ultimate grand scheme plan thing is to release it on the Wii U but I think they should have announced that by now and like I would have waited to play this game if they'd announced it on the Wii U I would have said cool it'll give me a launch game that sounds like it'll be pretty kick-ass based on everything I've read online but seeing as I'm getting to this point where I'm like you know what this game is never going to come out and I really want to play it so gosh there's this ABC how to run these games on my Wii right in front of my face I

361
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:23,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing it.

362
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:25,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play this game.

363
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:31,232
[SPEAKER_04]: So, be mad if you want, but I'm just being real.

364
00:27:31,492 --> 00:27:32,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the only one out there.

365
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:36,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Or major gaming websites will not be publishing how to get away with it.

366
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:41,501
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, it was just how to play the import copy of the game.

367
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:44,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, no, and that's fine, and I understand that.

368
00:27:44,404 --> 00:27:46,546
[SPEAKER_04]: But, let's be real...

369
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:51,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be real.

370
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,492
[SPEAKER_04]: You surely, you know, there's the thought of what you're really telling people.

371
00:27:57,692 --> 00:27:58,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

372
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:00,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be ignorant.

373
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:01,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say that to everybody.

374
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:03,675
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is what it is.

375
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that, you know.

376
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:09,338
[SPEAKER_04]: So will I buy the game if it comes out on Wii U?

377
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:13,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably, but I don't know.

378
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:18,264
[SPEAKER_04]: That depends if we want to buy the Wii U. Yeah, right now the question is, will I buy a Wii U?

379
00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:19,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

380
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:25,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing with the Wii U. I mean, look at some of the games that they're talking about coming out of the system.

381
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:27,450
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like Batman Arkham City.

382
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:29,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

383
00:28:29,732 --> 00:28:33,835
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to release a game that's been out for a year now on that system?

384
00:28:34,435 --> 00:28:35,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who cares?

385
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:35,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

386
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:38,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't even see a point.

387
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:40,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Release Skyward Sword on there then.

388
00:28:40,976 --> 00:28:43,557
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's going to fucking care because it's been out for a year.

389
00:28:46,478 --> 00:28:46,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

390
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:49,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now they just don't have much to bring to the table for that.

391
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be surprised if that system comes out next year.

392
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:55,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we'll see.

393
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:56,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well that's it.

394
00:28:57,422 --> 00:28:58,802
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to say for my gaming week.

395
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:01,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Xenoblade Chronicles is a great game.

396
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:04,564
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really too bad that Nintendo won't release it here.

397
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:05,225
[SPEAKER_04]: What else can I say?

398
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on and get some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's stories.

399
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:13,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not be here for the next two weeks.

400
00:29:14,554 --> 00:29:15,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, two weeks.

401
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:25,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually, after last week's show, I realized, oh crap, I've got the concert next week and then I actually have a scheduled trip to LA the week after that and it's the one I do every year, so...

402
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:47,906
[SPEAKER_04]: yep I'm taking a little break sorry guys but I believe the one and only Tiara is going to be here covering at least next week if not both weeks I don't know yet just next week so there will be some type of live shows so tune in as always and I'll miss you guys but at the same time damn we need vacations once in a while give me a break

403
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:50,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some gaming news.

411
00:30:00,678 --> 00:30:01,879
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start it off with Loki.

412
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't take vacations at all.

413
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:11,146
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Nintendo announced a lot of stuff at their pre-Tokyo Game Show press event.

414
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:17,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the stuff they announced, hey, you know those big games that you're waiting for, you know, ones that you may have purchased a system for?

415
00:30:18,231 --> 00:30:19,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're not coming this year.

416
00:30:19,872 --> 00:30:26,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Kid Icarus Uprising has been delayed to 2012, and that's for all regions.

417
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:29,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, you know, it's critically acclaimed, and...

418
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:32,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, looks amazing.

419
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:35,501
[SPEAKER_03]: They had new video footage for it, but yeah, not coming out this year.

420
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:37,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad.

421
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:44,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there's going to be a new system update coming for the 3DS in November.

422
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:47,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to add 3D video capture as well.

423
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:54,914
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely kind of a cool thing, because I know the 3D photos are pretty cool.

424
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:55,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

425
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:21,747
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that next year when there's the 3DS Lite or the 3DS XL or whatever crap they come up with, there's going to be better cameras in it, I'm sure, that will help with the 3D.

426
00:31:21,787 --> 00:31:26,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Because let's be real, not a lot of people have 3D cameras or 3D video cameras right now, so Nintendo could kind of get a jump on that.

427
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,893
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the whole thing, the 3D craze by implementing that.

428
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really surprised it didn't have video at launch.

429
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:36,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised at all that it's being patched in.

430
00:31:36,237 --> 00:31:37,178
[SPEAKER_04]: You're surprised?

431
00:31:38,078 --> 00:31:42,522
[SPEAKER_03]: The device didn't have all the features that they talked about.

432
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:44,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, eShop, you want to buy stuff?

433
00:31:44,543 --> 00:31:46,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, that's not coming for a few months.

434
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:46,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Touche.

435
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:48,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hey, you want to browse the internet?

436
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:51,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we didn't put the web browser in there.

437
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:52,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't quite done yet.

438
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:55,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Rush?

439
00:31:55,451 --> 00:31:56,751
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we didn't rush the system.

440
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:57,632
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

441
00:31:57,672 --> 00:31:59,173
[SPEAKER_03]: This was always planned like that.

442
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:03,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

443
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:04,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So, November.

444
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:06,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, they don't like to rush things.

445
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:07,436
[SPEAKER_03]: They're taking their time.

446
00:32:10,316 --> 00:32:36,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, one of the things that came out was this god awful ugly circle pad attachment for Monster Hunter Tri-G And of course, it's been announced that several titles will actually support it Including Resident Evil Revelations, Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D, Ace Combat 3D, Dynasty Warriors Versus, and Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance

447
00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:52,692
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course this device is going to require an additional AAA battery to use because it's got to communicate with the 3DS via the infrared port on the back and it will also add a couple extra shoulder buttons and of course the circle pad.

448
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:58,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny thing about the circle pad is it's not needed for Monster Hunter.

449
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:02,118
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact all the demo kiosks at Tokyo Game Show didn't have it.

450
00:33:03,783 --> 00:33:32,205
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting this this thing is so interesting because well a the whole fact that it requires a separate battery to run like you could just hear the face palming going on across Twitter and the blogs and so forth when that was announced so I'll just kind of let that speak for itself and the whole yeah yeah sure they plan to do this the whole time I'm really sure because they thought about adding that port on the back that could interface with this and power it but oops um of course then again you don't want anything else sucking the power out of the 3ds because it's not like it holds a lot to begin with right um

451
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:40,468
[SPEAKER_04]: but it really is sounding more and more like this is the 3DS's version of Motion Plus only it's happening a lot faster.

452
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:41,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

453
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:45,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really wonder how long it's going to be before this thing is mandatory.

454
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:51,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know on the remake next year there's going to be better cameras and the second analog pad.

455
00:33:53,192 --> 00:33:53,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

456
00:33:53,713 --> 00:33:55,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Second analog pad can go right there.

457
00:33:55,593 --> 00:33:58,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice little home for it right on the device.

458
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:01,075
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because the way it looks right now is just like a Wii U controller.

459
00:34:02,645 --> 00:34:09,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but see, I believe that the buttons are... Oh, actually, the buttons are above, or below the thing.

460
00:34:09,988 --> 00:34:10,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, fine.

461
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:13,529
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll move the buttons down, and then they'll put the circle pad there.

462
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:21,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, but they got you to buy a system because they dropped the price, right?

463
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:23,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha, suckers!

464
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:25,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll buy it again.

465
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,555
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Nintendo likes to do, sell you hardware over and over and over again.

466
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:30,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Game Boy?

467
00:34:32,591 --> 00:35:00,415
[SPEAKER_03]: coinora chatroom at chat.orangelandreda.com Randy says that 3DS attachment makes the thing look like a Game Gear a little bit I think the battery life might be a little better on a Game Gear though, not sure and then of course, you know, the best way to target your female audience is to put it out in pink so they have a 3DS coming out in pink in October yeah cool

468
00:35:02,932 --> 00:35:04,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily in the U.S.

469
00:35:04,574 --> 00:35:05,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in the U.S., in Japan only.

470
00:35:06,415 --> 00:35:07,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Are people really that shallow?

471
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:12,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I understand people like pink things, but it's like, oh, I'm not buying that system.

472
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:13,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's in pink!

473
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:14,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

474
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, people are that shallow.

475
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:17,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Just accept it and move on.

476
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:20,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I shake my head at you guys.

477
00:35:21,905 --> 00:35:23,566
[SPEAKER_03]: See, this is how they deal with all that shit.

478
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Put out a pink box for a game, huh?

479
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:30,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever blue systems come out, Miklatov's right there ready to buy one, so I don't know what to tell you.

480
00:35:31,091 --> 00:35:31,572
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on, Dan.

481
00:35:31,592 --> 00:35:32,152
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to say?

482
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:35,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Except it's muted.

483
00:35:35,295 --> 00:35:35,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

484
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:36,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

485
00:35:36,396 --> 00:35:38,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Pink Systems, giant sellers at Christmas time.

486
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:40,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they really?

487
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:41,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.

488
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,221
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get the pink DS light.

489
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,303
[SPEAKER_07]: You couldn't beg, borrow, or steal one of those at Christmas time.

490
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:49,925
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other time of the year, nobody fucking wanted them.

491
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:50,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it really?

492
00:35:50,646 --> 00:35:55,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, remember when I got my GBA?

493
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:56,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh dear God, no.

494
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,550
[SPEAKER_10]: My pink GBA.

495
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:58,451
[SPEAKER_07]: What about it?

496
00:35:58,511 --> 00:35:59,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And no one else could find them.

497
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:01,597
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

498
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:06,480
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it's not really just... GBA, that was a long time ago.

499
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't this pink and hard to find?

500
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:10,003
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really just about the colors, though, right?

501
00:36:10,023 --> 00:36:21,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know how many of you guys were watching the press conference that was going on, but they followed up this conversation on pink 3DSs with the girl-tailored games, which were... They looked really creepster to me.

502
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I didn't get it.

503
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,172
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, you know, it's a different culture, whatever.

504
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:26,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, some comedian-based game, I think, was one of them.

505
00:36:26,713 --> 00:36:27,274
[SPEAKER_03]: They have...

506
00:36:27,694 --> 00:36:30,135
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of girl-based games already.

507
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:35,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Ubisoft puts out a ton of girl games.

508
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:37,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is a ton of DS games.

509
00:36:37,857 --> 00:36:41,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to preface by saying, like, tween girl games.

510
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:51,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't want to infer, because DarkSakura might kick my butt, that girls, like, play different games and, like, you know, all girls hate Metroid and things like that.

511
00:36:51,662 --> 00:36:55,103
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, you know, the ones that are aimed at, like, the little girls.

512
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,085
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna punch you with this microphone.

513
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, let's be real, she did say she played a lot of Sims 3 this week.

514
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:07,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

515
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,131
[SPEAKER_07]: She's stuck on that Facebook Sims game.

516
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually didn't touch it.

517
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,493
[SPEAKER_07]: What a piece of crap.

518
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:14,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullshit.

519
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,275
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are stuck on that Facebook game.

520
00:37:17,615 --> 00:37:18,836
[SPEAKER_07]: You lie like a rug.

521
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:21,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't play it at all yesterday.

522
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:24,322
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why so many of my sims hated me.

523
00:37:24,522 --> 00:37:29,988
[SPEAKER_04]: But the DS, they did really try to market the DS at girls for a while.

524
00:37:30,008 --> 00:37:33,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they have Beyonce and Carrie Underwood doing commercials?

525
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:34,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, girls and women.

526
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:37,415
[SPEAKER_03]: If Beyonce does it, then I've got to do that.

527
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Girls and women were a huge marketing push with the Wii, too.

528
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo was just all about...

529
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:58,764
[SPEAKER_07]: 40% of the consumers out there, or 50% or 60% or whatever, are women, and we're not marketing to them, and you gotta sell to women, sell, sell, sell, recommend games for girls, girls, girls, girls, sell, sell, sell I'm like, you fucking people, have you seen the customers that come into my store?

530
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:10,027
[SPEAKER_07]: 99% male If there's a girl in my store, they stay out until the girl leaves No, that's not, that's not true Well, it's often true

531
00:38:11,698 --> 00:38:12,259
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

532
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:26,800
[SPEAKER_04]: But now they can see women in 3D on the 3DS.

533
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,920
[SPEAKER_04]: In 3D.

534
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,841
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D boobies.

535
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,982
[SPEAKER_10]: This will probably be the first time they ever see 3D boobies.

536
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:34,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

537
00:38:34,702 --> 00:38:35,563
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, I kid.

538
00:38:36,463 --> 00:38:39,424
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know how many of you guys again watched Nintendo's conference.

539
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:43,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously there was a lot of focus on the Monster Hunter games that's coming out.

540
00:38:43,345 --> 00:38:49,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Games, because there's Tri-G and then there's 4 that they announced is going to be a Nintendo 3DS thing as well.

541
00:38:49,887 --> 00:39:18,111
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I gotta say I was totally thinking of DarkSakura because after the press conference there was like 15 minutes of Monster Hunter commercials that featured Gatchaman like for 15 minutes like all these little Gatchaman ads for Monster Hunter games that made me laugh okay I need this if there's Gatchaman involved I watched them all thinking that that's when they were finally going to show that 3DS peripheral but what was very interesting that add-on completely absent from Nintendo's press conference that they did for not Tokyo Game Show

542
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:19,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care about any of that.

543
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,796
[SPEAKER_10]: You lost me at Gatchaman.

544
00:39:21,296 --> 00:39:22,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally being honest.

545
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:24,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have called you when it was on.

546
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to find them on YouTube.

547
00:39:26,202 --> 00:39:26,682
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to see this.

548
00:39:26,722 --> 00:39:27,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to find them on YouTube.

549
00:39:27,503 --> 00:39:28,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You might find them on YouTube.

550
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:28,704
[SPEAKER_04]: You might.

551
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:30,807
[SPEAKER_04]: They were all... It was funny.

552
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:42,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Kevin6L8 in our chatroom, maybe that's Kevin6L8 in our chatroom, says, In my store, about a good third of the people buying are teen to young adult girls.

553
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:43,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Buying what?

554
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:47,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming like DS and related systems, or maybe Wii?

555
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:49,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, why not Xbox?

556
00:39:49,594 --> 00:39:53,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the same thing I was watching, DarkSakura.

557
00:39:53,836 --> 00:39:54,396
[SPEAKER_07]: She brought it up.

558
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:54,856
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

559
00:39:56,517 --> 00:39:58,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to preface, I worked at a game crazy.

560
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:03,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also worked at a store, you know, a few years ago, back before girls started playing games.

561
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:06,704
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the scariest looking kaze I've ever seen.

562
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:07,925
[SPEAKER_07]: She didn't even pay attention.

563
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:08,445
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

564
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:09,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody cares.

565
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:14,409
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a 70s show about a bird ninja team.

566
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,351
[SPEAKER_10]: The science ninja team.

567
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:24,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's talk about the Vita a little bit, because there's a lot of news on the PlayStation Vita as well.

568
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:32,441
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, at their conference, they had this slide talking about 100 titles already announced for the Vita.

569
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:39,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Things like Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Katamari, DJ Maxx Technica...

570
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:55,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Sound Shapes, Super Stardust Delta, Wipeout, Ridge Racer, Zone of Enders HD, Metal Gear Solid HD, Gundam Games, Super Robot Taisen Games, Tales of Innocence, etc.

571
00:40:56,361 --> 00:41:02,768
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very interesting watching the Sony conference because they are doing everything they can to not fuck this up.

572
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:29,666
[SPEAKER_04]: and they are trying to just punch Nintendo into jugular and I tell you what the delay of the Vita in the US I'm telling you is so that the lineup looks as strong here they are doing what everybody says Nintendo should have done and everybody is saying Nintendo should not have launched a 3DS until Christmas and so what the Vita is doing is the Vita is waiting and it's building up an arsenal of games so that when that thing launches here it's going to come out with a bang it's really interesting

573
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:30,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

574
00:41:51,454 --> 00:41:51,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

575
00:41:52,294 --> 00:41:55,315
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, the Vita does come out December 17th.

576
00:41:55,535 --> 00:41:56,896
[SPEAKER_04]: The date has been announced in Japan.

577
00:41:57,536 --> 00:42:01,557
[SPEAKER_04]: They are cutting it really close there with the end of the year.

578
00:42:01,637 --> 00:42:05,258
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be way too late here in America to make the holiday season.

579
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:06,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think it would sell tons anyway.

580
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:13,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Sony's doing the right thing by waiting until next year because they're just going to dump a crap ton of games whenever it launches here.

581
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,981
[SPEAKER_04]: They did not announce the date here.

582
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:27,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, something to think about, it was reiterated this week on Twitter, in a Twitter conversation with Sony Computer Entertainment President of Worldwide Studios, Suhei Yoshida, has reiterated the Vita is region free.

583
00:42:28,072 --> 00:42:31,516
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to import one of those fuckers on December 17th, you're good to go.

584
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:32,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting the shakes already.

585
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Giving Nintendo an unopposed holiday season is not smart.

586
00:42:41,069 --> 00:42:47,821
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to at least, I mean, I'm sure that before the holiday season really kicks in that we'll at least know a date.

587
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:50,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I do agree.

588
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:57,200
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not going opposed in Japan, which is going to be the biggest battleground, I think, of sorts.

589
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:57,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

590
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:01,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not too worried about the 3DS in the U.S.

591
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:08,282
[SPEAKER_03]: because I think the games that they have coming out, they have, was it Super Mario 3D Land in November?

592
00:43:08,342 --> 00:43:09,023
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really it.

593
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:14,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And other than that, Mario Kart's coming out in December, but later on.

594
00:43:15,524 --> 00:43:15,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

595
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:16,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

596
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:20,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario definitely is a draw, but is it a system seller?

597
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:22,588
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing a Smash Brothers for that thing.

598
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:25,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're doing a Smash Brothers for that thing.

599
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:27,951
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point in time.

600
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:32,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know how many fucking people bought the Wii because they put Smash Brothers on it?

601
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:33,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I understand that, and that's fine.

602
00:43:34,295 --> 00:43:37,777
[SPEAKER_07]: All Nintendo needs to do is find that one fucking title.

603
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:39,638
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they've done with every system.

604
00:43:40,058 --> 00:43:43,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Every system people are just like, well, I don't know.

605
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Nintendo comes out with that one.

606
00:43:45,341 --> 00:43:45,822
[SPEAKER_07]: One title.

607
00:43:45,862 --> 00:43:49,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Which on the original DS was like Nintendogs or something.

608
00:43:49,425 --> 00:43:51,907
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody goes, I gotta have one of these fucking things.

609
00:43:52,247 --> 00:43:53,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Or fucking Brain Age.

610
00:43:53,749 --> 00:43:54,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

611
00:43:54,429 --> 00:43:59,493
[SPEAKER_07]: What happens if at Christmas that one title comes out and Sony's just left holding their sack?

612
00:44:00,214 --> 00:44:03,898
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not gonna, I'm sorry, it's not gonna First off, Smash Bros.

613
00:44:04,098 --> 00:44:09,524
[SPEAKER_03]: at E3, which they shouldn't have even really announced at E3 They were like, yeah, hey, I'm thinking about working on a Smash Bros.

614
00:44:09,544 --> 00:44:10,445
[SPEAKER_03]: game Is it in development?

615
00:44:10,605 --> 00:44:12,467
[SPEAKER_03]: No Is it coming out anytime soon?

616
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:21,037
[SPEAKER_03]: No But we're thinking about it, yeah Just like, we're thinking about doing a Pikmin game Where the fuck is your new Pikmin game that you promised us two years ago for the Wii?

617
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:22,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's never coming out

618
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So Smash Bros.

619
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:32,944
[SPEAKER_03]: for the 3DS, yeah, they promised that game's coming out now, but two years from now when it's like, hey, where's the Smash Bros.

620
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:33,664
[SPEAKER_03]: game you promised us?

621
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:38,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're going to put it on the next 3DS system that we're going to put out, so sorry.

622
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:38,627
[SPEAKER_03]: The 4DS.

623
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:44,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think the internet as a whole... Were you trying to say something, Jamie?

624
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:44,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Not anymore.

625
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:51,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think the internet as a whole is being a little hard on Nintendo.

626
00:44:51,392 --> 00:44:52,712
[SPEAKER_04]: He said hard on.

627
00:44:53,112 --> 00:45:00,275
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, for real, because... Believe me, I have my issues with Nintendo as well, but I think the 3DS is going to sell bucket loads this Christmas.

628
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:06,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people are seriously underestimating the power of that Mario Kart and the Mario Land 3D games.

629
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:07,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's going to sell...

630
00:45:07,957 --> 00:45:11,180
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of systems this holiday, especially with there not being a Vita.

631
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong, the Vita is going to be an impressive thing and going to have a huge launch next year.

632
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:18,585
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't do anything for this Christmas here in the U.S.

633
00:45:19,405 --> 00:45:23,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think those, like Mario Kart especially, is huge.

634
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:25,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think so.

635
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,552
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think they need to bring out motion sickness pills with it.

636
00:45:29,753 --> 00:45:32,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gone through 10 holiday seasons in-game retail.

637
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:34,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Second Analog Controller

638
00:45:52,324 --> 00:45:58,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a whole other issue, but I'm just talking format stuff-wise, is the 3D movies.

639
00:45:58,687 --> 00:46:02,489
[SPEAKER_04]: They were showing off a lot of this at E3, the year that the 3DS was shown.

640
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:06,410
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Netflix on the 3DS, but yet we don't have 3D movies yet.

641
00:46:06,691 --> 00:46:08,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon we're going to be able to record 3D movies.

642
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:11,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, have you checked out the Nintendo video service that they've got on there?

643
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:13,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but little five-minute videos?

644
00:46:13,394 --> 00:46:13,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking...

645
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:19,075
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were 83, they were talking about putting Tangled in 3D on a little cartridge.

646
00:46:19,495 --> 00:46:23,897
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lion King in 3D was the number one movie at the box office this weekend from 94.

647
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:26,177
[SPEAKER_04]: They put that thing on a 3DS cart.

648
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:27,438
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to sell like crazy.

649
00:46:28,278 --> 00:46:30,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's so much cheaper right now.

650
00:46:30,658 --> 00:46:32,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And they need to strike while the iron's hot.

651
00:46:32,419 --> 00:46:38,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much cheaper right now to invest in the 3DS as a 3D device than go get a freaking 3D television and glasses.

652
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,561
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not going to be the case much longer.

653
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:43,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Come a year from now, next holiday, I think 3D

654
00:46:44,162 --> 00:46:47,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, I can't wait.

655
00:46:49,026 --> 00:46:53,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a 3D TV because, kind of like Matt, I'm a sucker for technology.

656
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:57,071
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, as I've gotten older, I've gotten cheaper.

657
00:46:57,291 --> 00:47:00,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just like, oh man, I am not going to spend $3,000 on that.

658
00:47:01,766 --> 00:47:16,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially as fast as technology is getting better and better, you're definitely in a better position to wait because as soon as you buy one, it's just like, oh, hey, look, we came up with this technology that's even 10 times better and it's cheaper.

659
00:47:16,155 --> 00:47:18,197
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, come on.

660
00:47:18,217 --> 00:47:24,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I even waited and waited and waited about my 120 hertz TV because 120 hertz was supposed to be the 3D rate.

661
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:27,563
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, on this TV now, we can do 3D.

662
00:47:27,703 --> 00:47:29,364
[SPEAKER_07]: When the 3D comes out, this TV will work.

663
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:29,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like,

664
00:47:29,884 --> 00:47:30,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Great!

665
00:47:30,544 --> 00:47:31,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, fuck you.

666
00:47:31,204 --> 00:47:31,604
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gotta be 240.

667
00:47:31,825 --> 00:47:33,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you guys!

668
00:47:34,425 --> 00:47:35,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you right in the ear!

669
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,446
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's okay.

670
00:47:36,846 --> 00:47:40,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chat at chat.orange.com, HitStun says, Netflix is in 3D, right?

671
00:47:41,267 --> 00:47:41,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's not.

672
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:42,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Not on the 3DS.

673
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:48,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you would think it would be, but outside of the title screen and I think the menus, the content itself, not in 3D.

674
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:49,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet.

675
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:49,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

676
00:47:49,689 --> 00:47:50,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows what might happen.

677
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:55,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Kevin68 in our chat at chat.orange.com says, I'm not really into 3D.

678
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:56,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's more of a novelty to me.

679
00:47:57,091 --> 00:48:05,733
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I'm kind of there too, and I feel a little weird talking about hyping up 3D and everything, but I think for games, 3D might actually kind of be neat.

680
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:08,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I got to admit, some of the 3DS stuff's kind of cool.

681
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:15,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's a little bitty screen and so forth, but it's neat, at least for a little while.

682
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:20,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the Mario Kart game's going to be kind of neat, but I think there probably will be a point where I'm like, okay, let's turn the 3D off now.

683
00:48:22,296 --> 00:48:26,381
[SPEAKER_03]: See, with Mario Kart, it's a perfect example of what Nintendo does wrong.

684
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:32,688
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mario Kart, what they've done... Yeah, because every game only sells like 11-gajillion copies.

685
00:48:33,168 --> 00:48:36,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, because people are suckers and they're like, oh, it's a Mario game, I want to buy it.

686
00:48:37,633 --> 00:48:39,015
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's not why it happens.

687
00:48:39,075 --> 00:48:41,097
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because the Mario Kart games are good.

688
00:48:41,898 --> 00:48:42,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

689
00:48:42,218 --> 00:48:43,199
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not creative.

690
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:50,438
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not innovative, but they're always super fun and anyone can play them.

691
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And they just last.

692
00:48:53,061 --> 00:48:57,505
[SPEAKER_03]: The one series that Nintendo really doesn't need to do anything to.

693
00:48:57,665 --> 00:49:00,608
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how they put out stuff and don't really do anything?

694
00:49:00,668 --> 00:49:04,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Animal Crossing, they change absolutely nothing and they put out the new game on another system.

695
00:49:05,973 --> 00:49:06,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

696
00:49:07,034 --> 00:49:08,776
[SPEAKER_04]: In the new Animal Crossing you'll get to sit on a bench.

697
00:49:09,376 --> 00:49:09,756
[SPEAKER_03]: and Swim.

698
00:49:10,537 --> 00:49:11,438
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's fine.

699
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, two things.

700
00:49:12,879 --> 00:49:15,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's in a different camera perspective.

701
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:16,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoop-dee-shit.

702
00:49:17,161 --> 00:49:20,304
[SPEAKER_03]: But one series that they don't really need to do anything to is Mario Kart.

703
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Mario Kart was always good as it was.

704
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:23,526
[SPEAKER_04]: But Hang Gliders!

705
00:49:24,486 --> 00:49:25,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Hang Gliders.

706
00:49:25,347 --> 00:49:26,408
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

707
00:49:26,848 --> 00:49:31,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, they've ruined Battle Mode after the 64 versions.

708
00:49:31,731 --> 00:49:33,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Battle Mode was ruined after the first one.

709
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:35,254
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was good.

710
00:49:35,274 --> 00:49:36,695
[SPEAKER_07]: The 64 version was still fun.

711
00:49:36,715 --> 00:49:37,175
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so good on

712
00:49:38,447 --> 00:49:39,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Mode 7 Battle Screen.

713
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:41,015
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so cool.

714
00:49:42,218 --> 00:49:44,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario Kart 64 is an awesome game that I haven't spent enough time on.

715
00:49:47,024 --> 00:49:49,625
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, Block Fort was awesome in Mario Kart 64.

716
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:50,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's where it was at.

717
00:49:51,206 --> 00:49:55,147
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, now they're just, they're trying too hard, I guess.

718
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:59,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Because with Double Dash, it was like, oh, look, you can have a partner, you can switch back and forth.

719
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,029
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was terrible.

720
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Double Dash was awesome.

721
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:09,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now they have, like, oh, look, hey, we're going to have motorcycles and monster trucks and hang gliders and underwater sub things.

722
00:50:09,293 --> 00:50:09,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Who gives a shit?

723
00:50:09,993 --> 00:50:11,134
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a kart racing game.

724
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:16,107
[SPEAKER_07]: One year that we set up like an eight-player system-linked Mario Kart game.

725
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:17,927
[SPEAKER_07]: That was so great.

726
00:50:18,528 --> 00:50:23,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody controlling the rear guy and just punching people in front of him was like amazing.

727
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me try to kind of move on the conversation a little bit here.

728
00:50:26,371 --> 00:50:30,512
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jamie, I want to hear from you for a minute because Nintendo is targeting women.

729
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:34,814
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think the 3DS's chances are this Christmas?

730
00:50:35,874 --> 00:50:37,575
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be good because it's a Nintendo system.

731
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:40,117
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, people buy Nintendo systems.

732
00:50:40,157 --> 00:50:40,938
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really it.

733
00:50:41,398 --> 00:50:43,420
[SPEAKER_10]: And people are going to buy the shit that comes out.

734
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, imagine babies and fart monsters or something.

735
00:50:46,462 --> 00:50:49,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have a game called Fart Monster 3D?

736
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,820
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they have... Let's see what would be the closest thing to that.

737
00:50:56,941 --> 00:50:58,241
[SPEAKER_03]: They have pet zombies.

738
00:50:58,301 --> 00:50:59,902
[SPEAKER_03]: You can raise your own pet zombie.

739
00:50:59,922 --> 00:51:00,542
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of funny.

740
00:51:00,562 --> 00:51:01,283
[SPEAKER_03]: You're shitting me.

741
00:51:01,343 --> 00:51:01,523
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

742
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:03,904
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesomely bad.

743
00:51:04,624 --> 00:51:04,884
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

744
00:51:04,924 --> 00:51:07,345
[SPEAKER_10]: I would play that because it's awesomely bad.

745
00:51:07,425 --> 00:51:10,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we got to get back to some of this stuff on the Vita because... Go ahead.

746
00:51:10,926 --> 00:51:14,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say if they want to sell me one, just give me my Kid Icarus already.

747
00:51:15,788 --> 00:51:16,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon.

748
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:16,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon.

749
00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:17,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year.

750
00:51:18,754 --> 00:51:23,417
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, some of the chat is pointing out that Dan's audio is in and out.

751
00:51:23,677 --> 00:51:26,079
[SPEAKER_04]: He does have the busted mic right now.

752
00:51:26,759 --> 00:51:30,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to put a mic by the door so that Dan would come in here and yell random shit.

753
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:34,024
[SPEAKER_04]: He might be encouraged to pick up a mic and say it into the microphone.

754
00:51:35,365 --> 00:51:38,267
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, the only microphone we have is the half-busted one.

755
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:40,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize for the shoddy audio quality.

756
00:51:40,828 --> 00:51:41,289
[SPEAKER_04]: We hear that.

757
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:41,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dan.

758
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:43,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, now we can't.

759
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,481
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

760
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:46,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hold the cord in a little bit.

761
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:47,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you just have to do it.

762
00:51:47,386 --> 00:51:50,493
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to kind of just kind of push it together like it's falling apart.

763
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:51,556
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

764
00:51:52,498 --> 00:51:53,501
[SPEAKER_04]: More Vita news.

765
00:51:53,561 --> 00:51:54,563
[SPEAKER_04]: My husband's a prevert.

766
00:51:56,691 --> 00:52:19,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned this in the overview of what all games are coming out, but I just kind of want to revisit It was announced that Zone of the Enders HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid is coming to the Vita As well as Ninja Gaiden, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Katamari, and this was the huge bombshell that was dropped

767
00:52:20,936 --> 00:52:27,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy X Remake or HD version or whatever they're calling it is coming out.

768
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:28,998
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a remake of Final Fantasy.

769
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:32,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy X. Yeah.

770
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:34,119
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't go with one everyone wants.

771
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:37,560
[SPEAKER_10]: They just go with one that all they have to do is update a few textures on and boom.

772
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think you hit the nail on the head.

773
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:43,521
[SPEAKER_04]: There's far less work to be done with Final Fantasy X and they can get it done a lot faster.

774
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:44,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even updating the textures.

775
00:52:44,982 --> 00:52:45,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just uprising.

776
00:52:46,018 --> 00:52:46,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

777
00:53:12,493 --> 00:53:15,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just going to be up-res textures and polygons.

778
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:19,297
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be Konami quality.

779
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:28,242
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of Twitter rage on 7 fans versus 10 fans this week when the remake was announced, I noticed.

780
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,682
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer seems obvious to me.

781
00:53:29,702 --> 00:53:32,064
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 is just an easier thing to remake.

782
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Both games are equally popular in Japan.

783
00:53:34,625 --> 00:54:00,717
[SPEAKER_03]: well yeah, um, up-rezzing it to HD is a little different than remaking the whole damn game, you know, one is a lot easier to do than the other, so that's why you don't have a set, because if you up-rezz 7 it's gonna look like shit and I don't know why there's so many 10 haters I don't know if it's because of like the whiny emo voice acting and stuff, but like Lulu is like one of the most badass characters like in a video game I really like 10-2 I really like 10-2 10-2's okay 10-2's fun and festive

784
00:54:04,605 --> 00:54:06,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Some days you want to have crazy hat day.

785
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:08,210
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the girl fest.

786
00:54:08,491 --> 00:54:08,972
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

787
00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:39,728
[SPEAKER_04]: especially because there was like this whole area like when you're on that long road that you could just cycle back through your dress fears and like level them all up super quickly like over and over again if you had a couple hours to spend on it well who knows if Final Fantasy 10 sells well enough in a remake edition or what have you they might have 10 too give us 7 you whores here's my other question is and I don't know if you know this Loki but some people are saying that this Final Fantasy 10 remake is not just for the Vita that it's for the Playstation 3 as well yes it is wow

788
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:42,231
[SPEAKER_04]: That's neat.

789
00:54:42,331 --> 00:54:43,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Kevin68 makes a good point.

790
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:43,852
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

791
00:54:44,032 --> 00:54:44,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Arun was badass.

792
00:54:45,734 --> 00:54:46,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he was.

793
00:54:46,615 --> 00:54:49,098
[SPEAKER_04]: He was so badass they put him in Kingdom Hearts as well.

794
00:54:49,698 --> 00:54:50,179
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

795
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,783
[SPEAKER_10]: He was like the only, because you know I leveled through the game so quickly.

796
00:54:54,883 --> 00:55:02,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I went through the game without leveling so quickly that by the time I got to that last, what was that fucker's name with the blue hair?

797
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:10,996
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, what about that Final Fantasy musical game they are making?

798
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,798
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a 3DS, not a Vita game, but it's that Thetra Rhythm or whatever it was called?

799
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:32,791
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked dumb.

800
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:34,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

801
00:55:34,593 --> 00:55:38,037
[SPEAKER_04]: If the game was like $20 maybe, but $40, no thank you.

802
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:46,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to last week's show and the whole price tag rant because what are the Vita games going to be priced at?

803
00:55:46,806 --> 00:55:47,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they all going to be $40 too?

804
00:55:47,487 --> 00:55:47,467
$50. $50.

805
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:50,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut the fuck up.

806
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:51,532
[SPEAKER_04]: For real?

807
00:55:51,632 --> 00:55:53,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Vita games are going to be $50?

808
00:55:53,894 --> 00:55:54,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

809
00:55:54,835 --> 00:55:55,795
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP games were fucking $50.

810
00:55:55,835 --> 00:55:56,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

811
00:55:57,336 --> 00:55:57,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Where have you been?

812
00:55:58,537 --> 00:55:59,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

813
00:55:59,978 --> 00:56:01,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently my head's been in the sand.

814
00:56:01,379 --> 00:56:02,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't buy a whole lot of PSP games.

815
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,240
[SPEAKER_03]: $50 and $40.

816
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,862
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be PSP priced, I think.

817
00:56:07,723 --> 00:56:08,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

818
00:56:08,123 --> 00:56:08,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe $60.

819
00:56:08,924 --> 00:56:13,407
[SPEAKER_03]: The only price I've seen so far is on Lego Harry Potter.

820
00:56:14,107 --> 00:56:16,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was $50.

821
00:56:16,629 --> 00:56:17,650
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Seymour Guado.

822
00:56:20,413 --> 00:56:21,155
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it was Seymour.

823
00:56:21,175 --> 00:56:22,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you want to see more Guado.

824
00:56:23,742 --> 00:56:24,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I like fuckwad.

825
00:56:24,524 --> 00:56:25,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Seymour fuckwad.

826
00:56:26,151 --> 00:56:36,158
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's the only one that... Because the only two titles that I actually have info on were Lego Harry Potter 2 and Dragon something.

827
00:56:36,178 --> 00:56:37,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the hell the other one was called.

828
00:56:37,899 --> 00:56:45,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Dragon Dust or... Suddenly buying the Magicka Uber Edition for $10 on Steam doesn't seem like such a bad idea.

829
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:50,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, game pricing is so fucked up right now.

830
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:50,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I just...

831
00:56:51,969 --> 00:57:13,067
[SPEAKER_04]: it's we're in such this crazy state that we haven't been in gaming's history games have always kind of been around that same price but now we've got 99 cent Angry Birds versus $50 Vita games it's all about projection value though I mean look at look at the games that they're putting out now what they have to do they have you know Hollywood voice actors and not all games have that but they have you know

832
00:57:14,207 --> 00:57:15,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

833
00:57:35,422 --> 00:57:36,482
[SPEAKER_04]: What about movies?

834
00:57:37,022 --> 00:57:40,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Blair Witch Project was made for what, like a nickel?

835
00:57:40,203 --> 00:57:44,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you had Titanic, and it cost the same to see both of those movies.

836
00:57:44,124 --> 00:57:51,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I guess I understand now that with the 3D is throwing this interesting monkey wrench into it, you're not going to see independent 3D movies right now anyway.

837
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:51,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yes.

838
00:57:51,946 --> 00:58:01,808
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand that movies, when they come to theaters, are all the same price, but that's up to the studios to make that decision whether they want to have a high-budget movie or a low-budget movie.

839
00:58:02,248 --> 00:58:02,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

840
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:28,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because they've already had it out there and they've already made some money back from it already before they've gone and sold it on DVD or video on demand or however else you consume your entertainment.

841
00:58:28,868 --> 00:58:33,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it really just depends on what the quality of the game is though and how much you're into it.

842
00:58:34,032 --> 00:58:41,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the interesting thing about Steam too is that it's kind of like one of those, well, once we've sold it to everybody that we think is going to buy it for 50 bucks, let's try to knock it down to 40.

843
00:58:41,657 --> 00:58:43,579
[SPEAKER_04]: We can name that tune.

844
00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:45,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll buy that game for 50 bucks.

845
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:53,866
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, though, I have a problem with a game that's terrible that's being sold for $60 when it clearly looks like it's an up-res PlayStation 2 game.

846
00:58:54,406 --> 00:59:01,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, in the case of Activision and EA, where they put out Rock Band and Guitar Hero and they sell it for $60 on the Wii.

847
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, dude, it's...

848
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:09,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It's less production quality for that version of the game than it was the other ones.

849
00:59:09,737 --> 00:59:10,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends what you're talking about.

850
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:15,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're talking about games, there's no money to be made anywhere, but if you're talking about movies, then that's a different story.

851
00:59:30,603 --> 00:59:33,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on with some more news stories.

852
00:59:33,525 --> 00:59:41,669
[SPEAKER_04]: We could talk all night about how games are really expensive, but at the end of the day, seriously, if Civilization 6 was announced and they were going to charge $100 for it, I'd probably still pay it.

853
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:45,055
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

854
01:00:09,568 --> 01:00:10,108
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

855
01:00:10,508 --> 01:00:12,049
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't actually import that.

856
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:15,189
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought it at an import store and I didn't pay that much for it.

857
01:00:15,269 --> 01:00:15,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Excusez-moi.

858
01:00:15,909 --> 01:00:17,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, are you a fan of Lord of the Rings?

859
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:20,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they've got a Lord of the Rings War of the North thing that's coming out.

860
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:23,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes in a quiver, a leather quiver.

861
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:24,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember you mentioning that.

862
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:27,112
[SPEAKER_10]: For the record, I am not a Lord of the Rings fan.

863
01:00:27,872 --> 01:00:28,472
[SPEAKER_10]: The movies were okay.

864
01:00:28,512 --> 01:00:29,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a fan of leather quivers?

865
01:00:30,092 --> 01:00:30,312
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

866
01:00:30,973 --> 01:00:37,514
[SPEAKER_10]: The movies were okay and the books, the stories were great, the stories, but Tolkien's writing pisses me off.

867
01:00:38,744 --> 01:00:39,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a fan of guns?

868
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:39,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

869
01:00:39,965 --> 01:00:42,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's a Red Dead Redemption coming out with a six shooter.

870
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:43,666
[SPEAKER_04]: You want a gun?

871
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:44,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a gun.

872
01:00:45,347 --> 01:00:46,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I just made that up.

873
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,087
[SPEAKER_04]: You totally made that up.

874
01:00:47,288 --> 01:00:48,348
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually went looking at guns.

875
01:00:49,048 --> 01:00:50,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want DarkSakura to get excited about a gun.

876
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:51,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a gun.

877
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:54,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want DarkSakura to own a gun.

878
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:55,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

879
01:00:55,691 --> 01:00:56,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you'll shoot me.

880
01:00:57,252 --> 01:00:58,172
I won't.

881
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:00,253
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I won't.

882
01:01:00,293 --> 01:01:03,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because someone has a gun doesn't mean that they'll use a gun.

883
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:05,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but we're talking about you, though.

884
01:01:07,844 --> 01:01:08,064
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

885
01:01:08,524 --> 01:01:09,965
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be safely in a locker.

886
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:12,226
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would go outside to shoot it.

887
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:14,007
[SPEAKER_10]: You're red in the face.

888
01:01:14,027 --> 01:01:15,808
[SPEAKER_03]: We're waiting until you get outside of the house.

889
01:01:16,588 --> 01:01:19,590
[SPEAKER_03]: That way we can say you were a prowler.

890
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:23,912
[SPEAKER_04]: The next time Shermie shits on the floor, she's gonna get it.

891
01:01:24,452 --> 01:01:24,673
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

892
01:01:24,713 --> 01:01:25,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she can absorb a bullet.

893
01:01:26,014 --> 01:01:27,656
[SPEAKER_10]: She's right there.

894
01:01:28,657 --> 01:01:29,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Be nice to the cat.

895
01:01:29,698 --> 01:01:30,619
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't shoot the cat.

896
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:32,460
[SPEAKER_10]: I like her better than anyone else in this room.

897
01:01:33,161 --> 01:01:38,066
[SPEAKER_03]: As they put it in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, she's cultivating mass.

898
01:01:39,368 --> 01:01:40,829
[SPEAKER_10]: She's cultivating sleep right now.

899
01:01:41,009 --> 01:01:43,592
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, let's move on with some gaming news.

900
01:01:44,088 --> 01:01:51,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony or bitches, wait, they actually amended their online terms to block class action lawsuits.

901
01:01:51,393 --> 01:01:55,416
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually a section called Binding Individual Arbitration.

902
01:01:56,296 --> 01:02:13,608
[SPEAKER_10]: So, to quote, it says, any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in the class or representative action as a named or unnamed member in a class consolidation, representative, or private attorney general action.

903
01:02:14,929 --> 01:02:18,491
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, if you want to use our shit, you can't sue us in a class action.

904
01:02:20,232 --> 01:02:21,013
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can opt out.

905
01:02:21,801 --> 01:02:22,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can opt out of it.

906
01:02:22,922 --> 01:02:26,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You can send Sony a postcard or whatever and opt out of that.

907
01:02:26,864 --> 01:02:29,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make specially made postcards to Sony.

908
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:30,407
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big middle finger.

909
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:33,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Opt out of this, bitch.

910
01:02:34,229 --> 01:02:35,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's what it says.

911
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:46,637
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do not agree with the new terms of service or privacy policy, or if you do not wish to enter into an agreement with Sony, you may decline the TOS and privacy policy, and we will close your account and return your funds.

912
01:02:48,357 --> 01:02:51,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so in other words, if you want to opt out, then fuck off.

913
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,741
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't use our service at all.

914
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:56,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just a opt out because I want to sue you someday.

915
01:02:56,844 --> 01:03:01,827
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the only reason I'm like, whatever, Sony, is because the PlayStation Network is free.

916
01:03:02,288 --> 01:03:03,849
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of one of those, you know, whatever.

917
01:03:03,969 --> 01:03:06,551
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, there is PlayStation Plus.

918
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it also...

919
01:03:08,272 --> 01:03:08,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

920
01:03:08,592 --> 01:03:09,473
[SPEAKER_10]: It says more, actually.

921
01:03:09,493 --> 01:03:09,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

922
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:25,243
[SPEAKER_10]: It says, if the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire section 15 will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court and you and the Sony entity, you have a dispute with each agreed to waive in that instance to the fullest extent allowed by the law in a trial by jury.

923
01:03:25,443 --> 01:03:31,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, this may not actually be legal and if it ends up being illegal, then forget I ever said anything.

924
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:36,170
[SPEAKER_03]: But AT&T, there's a court case with AT&T that already set precedent that this is legal, so.

925
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:36,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

926
01:03:37,091 --> 01:03:37,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

927
01:03:37,751 --> 01:03:38,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much you can do there.

928
01:03:39,713 --> 01:03:40,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

929
01:03:40,814 --> 01:03:41,995
[SPEAKER_04]: It does seem a little bit wrong to me.

930
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:42,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

931
01:03:42,716 --> 01:03:44,418
[SPEAKER_03]: When am I actually going to sue Sony?

932
01:03:45,118 --> 01:03:48,301
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they going to do to me that's really going to have me sue them?

933
01:03:48,482 --> 01:03:48,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

934
01:03:49,402 --> 01:03:51,945
[SPEAKER_10]: You can sue them individually.

935
01:03:52,145 --> 01:03:54,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still waiting for money back from Microsoft.

936
01:03:55,028 --> 01:03:57,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more likely to sue them before I sue Sony.

937
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:01,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's basically saying... Sorry, go ahead.

938
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:02,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

939
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:07,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, but you'd be suing on an individual basis and not as a class action.

940
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:08,130
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

941
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,511
[SPEAKER_10]: But Microsoft has nothing to do with Sony.

942
01:04:10,172 --> 01:04:10,392
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

943
01:04:12,153 --> 01:04:12,753
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the whole point.

944
01:04:12,813 --> 01:04:18,317
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, you can hire an attorney and you can spend all the money to sue them on your own and get, you know, maybe...

945
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:22,281
[SPEAKER_10]: $15,000, I'm just using an arbitrary figure, $15,000.

946
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:31,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Where as opposed to a class action lawsuit with maybe a million users and each of them get $5, that's 5 million bucks.

947
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:33,452
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, think about that.

948
01:04:34,993 --> 01:04:37,115
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a way to basically save their assets.

949
01:04:38,276 --> 01:04:39,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Not asses, assets.

950
01:04:40,074 --> 01:04:46,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And also because they're a bigger company and they have money to throw at this type of stuff, they can just drag it out forever until you run out of money to fight it.

951
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, it's kind of an intimidation thing.

952
01:04:48,758 --> 01:04:52,980
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of one of those, we're bigger than you are, so you can sue us and we'll just get scarier and scarier.

953
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,320
[SPEAKER_04]: But guess who doesn't use PlayStation Network?

954
01:04:56,521 --> 01:05:06,986
[SPEAKER_04]: But, well, you may not use PlayStation Network, but as Loki said, AT&T set a precedent for this, so maybe Sony's setting a precedent for this in the gaming world, and by the time the Wii U comes out with its online service...

955
01:05:11,229 --> 01:05:12,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll have something like this as well.

956
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:17,534
[SPEAKER_04]: And Xbox Live may adopt a similar policy when it does its whole little remodel.

957
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:23,919
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think this really needs to be... Because basically it's like they're trying to manipulate the court system.

958
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:32,286
[SPEAKER_10]: They should have no jurisdiction in determining how someone can legally challenge...

959
01:05:34,557 --> 01:05:34,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.

960
01:05:35,137 --> 01:05:40,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Pop is just rambling about this in our chat room, so I want to read some of these comments here at chat.orangelunchated.com.

961
01:05:40,899 --> 01:05:42,200
[SPEAKER_04]: That is embarrassingly dumb.

962
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:51,504
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason why you'd ever need to be approached to be part of a class action and having that class action go to trial is because there's obviously clearly incompetent shit going on on a wide scale.

963
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:53,324
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the point of a class action.

964
01:05:53,444 --> 01:05:54,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.

965
01:05:54,505 --> 01:05:59,987
[SPEAKER_04]: If you try to form a class action and you don't have a case and you're just a butt-mad neckbeard, you'll be laughed out of court.

966
01:06:00,467 --> 01:06:06,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Class actions are the only real way you can make a company pay huge punitive damages as punishment for their shady dealings.

967
01:06:07,154 --> 01:06:12,720
[SPEAKER_04]: In an individual case, if you're in the right, yeah, you'll get paid well, but it won't be punitive damages kind of money.

968
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So Sony is trying to protect their wallet.

969
01:06:16,283 --> 01:06:17,124
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly it.

970
01:06:17,244 --> 01:06:18,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I like butt-mad neck beard.

971
01:06:20,548 --> 01:06:22,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes me think of those guys that get up and ask questions at BlizzCon.

972
01:06:24,718 --> 01:06:25,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's exactly it.

973
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:29,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that was pretty much the point I was trying to make.

974
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:35,182
[SPEAKER_10]: They're trying to save money and not basically have to take any responsibility for the shit that they're doing.

975
01:06:36,462 --> 01:06:40,524
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day, I don't really like it, but I hit accept anyway because I wanted to play my games online.

976
01:06:41,861 --> 01:06:43,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's the problem.

977
01:06:44,105 --> 01:06:44,766
[SPEAKER_04]: What can you do?

978
01:06:44,906 --> 01:06:46,108
[SPEAKER_10]: That right there is the problem.

979
01:06:46,188 --> 01:06:48,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, no offense or anything.

980
01:06:48,651 --> 01:06:49,813
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not pointing at you.

981
01:06:50,254 --> 01:06:53,659
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's why they can get away with it.

982
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Because people will say, oh, I just want to play my games.

983
01:06:56,403 --> 01:06:57,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't give a shit.

984
01:06:58,145 --> 01:07:00,186
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's how they're going to get away with it.

985
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's going to be too many people doing that.

986
01:07:01,966 --> 01:07:02,626
[SPEAKER_04]: What can you do?

987
01:07:02,966 --> 01:07:03,567
[SPEAKER_04]: What can you do?

988
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:05,307
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you hold this company accountable?

989
01:07:06,207 --> 01:07:17,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I still believe, even though whatever AT&T set a precedent, if they fuck up on the scale of the network breach again, I'm sorry, this little passage 15 isn't going to hold up.

990
01:07:17,651 --> 01:07:20,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Congress is investigating Sony for their fuck up.

991
01:07:21,372 --> 01:07:21,932
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

992
01:07:21,992 --> 01:07:26,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they don't have a deficit or anything to worry about.

993
01:07:26,633 --> 01:07:27,354
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

994
01:07:27,454 --> 01:07:36,762
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just... But the whole point is that by sitting around and doing nothing, they're going to get away with this as long as they can, and a lot of people are going to get screwed.

995
01:07:36,782 --> 01:07:38,884
[SPEAKER_04]: There is internet rage, DarkSakura.

996
01:07:38,924 --> 01:07:41,546
[SPEAKER_04]: That is how we're responding with internet rage.

997
01:07:41,646 --> 01:07:42,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I am very upset at Shoni.

998
01:07:43,757 --> 01:07:45,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there actually is a number of things you can do.

999
01:07:45,639 --> 01:08:04,895
[SPEAKER_10]: You can write your, you know, your representatives to, you know, double check the legality of this because clearly they're not going to, you know, they'd have to evaluate it on a state-by-state basis too to see if any of that's going to fly because they have to deal with state laws as well and they can't stand in the way of, you know, legal proceeding.

1000
01:08:05,115 --> 01:08:07,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can send Loki's card with the giant middle finger.

1001
01:08:08,478 --> 01:08:09,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to be serious.

1002
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know.

1003
01:08:11,037 --> 01:08:14,419
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole point is that it's something that should not be allowed to pass.

1004
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:28,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Marisa Congusto in our chat room says there is pending legislation about word salad legal agreements but this won't stop arbitration clauses which you are a part of in many areas that you don't even know of.

1005
01:08:28,905 --> 01:08:29,485
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very true.

1006
01:08:29,545 --> 01:08:35,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Very common like cell phone agreements and just all sorts of anything you sign probably has some stupid arbitration clause in it.

1007
01:08:37,368 --> 01:09:05,955
[SPEAKER_04]: this country I'd be interested though how does Sony protect themselves in other countries because if they were to screw up again that might hold a legal thing in the US but did they have to do the same thing in Canada or they'd probably do whatever the equivalent law is you know have something hmm kind of interesting all right let's move on with some more gaming news we could talk about this all night but

1008
01:09:07,638 --> 01:09:10,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy X, the remake, is not the only Final Fantasy that's coming out.

1009
01:09:11,622 --> 01:09:17,006
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also, well, Final Fantasy XIV, I guess, is never coming out, but never coming out working, that is.

1010
01:09:18,628 --> 01:09:21,930
[SPEAKER_03]: But Final Fantasy XIII, too, though, is on its way out.

1011
01:09:22,151 --> 01:09:26,194
[SPEAKER_03]: It is 90% complete as of Tokyo Game Show, and...

1012
01:09:27,535 --> 01:09:30,758
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1013
01:09:47,205 --> 01:09:47,965
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be available.

1014
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:54,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the game itself will feature time travel, so that's kind of neat.

1015
01:09:54,989 --> 01:10:06,195
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is launching next year on the North American region, January 31st, and also Europe is getting it February 2nd.

1016
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:09,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan is, though, seeing it this year on December 15th.

1017
01:10:10,718 --> 01:10:14,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, they're also launching in Japan with an exclusive...

1018
01:10:16,061 --> 01:10:22,707
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3 system that's pink and black and it's got a laser etched lightning on it.

1019
01:10:23,007 --> 01:10:33,055
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lightning Edition version 2 which will include a 320 gigabyte hard drive, the game, and a controller for the price of 37,960 yen or $495 dollars.

1020
01:10:38,117 --> 01:10:38,818
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty awesome.

1021
01:10:38,998 --> 01:10:39,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1022
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:44,167
[SPEAKER_04]: It does seem a little weird that they're releasing a whole new PlayStation, though.

1023
01:10:44,367 --> 01:10:44,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1024
01:10:44,788 --> 01:10:46,190
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a limited edition.

1025
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:47,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, whatever.

1026
01:10:47,292 --> 01:10:48,133
[SPEAKER_03]: They did Call of Duty.

1027
01:10:48,193 --> 01:10:51,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't the Final Fantasy fans have already bought one for Final Fantasy 13, the original?

1028
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:52,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is me.

1029
01:10:54,102 --> 01:10:55,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe.

1030
01:10:55,383 --> 01:10:55,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1031
01:10:56,683 --> 01:11:02,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, as we said earlier, Final Fantasy X, the remake for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3.

1032
01:11:02,485 --> 01:11:04,486
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be coming out later on.

1033
01:11:04,746 --> 01:11:05,786
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad on that, Loki.

1034
01:11:05,806 --> 01:11:06,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1035
01:11:06,447 --> 01:11:06,827
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all right.

1036
01:11:06,927 --> 01:11:07,387
[SPEAKER_03]: No big deal.

1037
01:11:08,127 --> 01:11:09,628
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to mention it again because it's awesome.

1038
01:11:10,913 --> 01:11:12,674
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something I'm going to probably pick up, no doubt.

1039
01:11:12,694 --> 01:11:13,735
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I would love to see?

1040
01:11:14,055 --> 01:11:14,495
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1041
01:11:14,755 --> 01:11:24,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously this won't happen until they kill off the PlayStation 2 version of it, but an HD remake version of Final Fantasy XI that's free to play would be awesome.

1042
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I could happen.

1043
01:11:25,341 --> 01:11:28,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't I talk about this a couple weeks ago on the show that they were investigating dumping the PlayStation 2?

1044
01:11:28,763 --> 01:11:30,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you did mention that.

1045
01:11:31,044 --> 01:11:33,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, hasn't there been a rumor about XI on the Vita already?

1046
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:34,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there has.

1047
01:11:34,225 --> 01:11:34,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1048
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine if that game goes free to play?

1049
01:11:37,447 --> 01:11:38,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what I'm going to do.

1050
01:11:41,329 --> 01:11:43,230
[SPEAKER_04]: The wife won't have a reason to stop you now.

1051
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:44,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

1052
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:45,272
[SPEAKER_03]: See, here's the thing, though.

1053
01:11:45,292 --> 01:11:49,074
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason I stopped my subscription is because I don't get a lot of time to play.

1054
01:11:49,454 --> 01:11:52,616
[SPEAKER_03]: So it may be an hour or two every few days.

1055
01:11:53,256 --> 01:11:54,717
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's free to play, who gives a shit?

1056
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:58,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't play for a few days or weeks or whatever.

1057
01:11:58,899 --> 01:11:59,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not paying for it!

1058
01:12:01,465 --> 01:12:09,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go to this next story, which is, yeah, this is interesting, because this is about reviews.

1059
01:12:10,087 --> 01:12:11,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're going to talk about game reviews for a little bit.

1060
01:12:12,088 --> 01:12:15,728
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, Gears of War 3 is on its way out, and it's kind of a big deal.

1061
01:12:16,148 --> 01:12:20,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you're into these types of shooter games at all, it's kind of a big deal.

1062
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:21,470
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game's getting good reviews.

1063
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting a lot of great reviews, glowing reviews everywhere.

1064
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:30,852
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an article, however, with VG247.com that Cliff Baczynski, or Cliffy B., did.

1065
01:12:31,372 --> 01:12:35,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about Gears of War, let me read the little passage of the interview here.

1066
01:12:35,753 --> 01:12:38,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you pleased with the review scores this morning?

1067
01:12:38,634 --> 01:12:39,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Asked the website.

1068
01:12:40,095 --> 01:12:43,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Cliff B. said, doing great, apart from a couple of haters.

1069
01:12:44,036 --> 01:12:45,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Magazine asked, who were the haters?

1070
01:12:45,796 --> 01:12:48,557
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, a certain gamer of the Euro.

1071
01:12:49,097 --> 01:12:51,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of calling out Eurogamer.

1072
01:12:51,818 --> 01:12:53,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was their problem with the game?

1073
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:56,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't read the review, asked the magazine, to which Cliffy B followed up.

1074
01:12:56,661 --> 01:12:58,222
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't quite gather it.

1075
01:12:58,662 --> 01:13:00,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to come across as defensive.

1076
01:13:00,603 --> 01:13:01,964
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I phrase this properly?

1077
01:13:02,264 --> 01:13:09,209
[SPEAKER_04]: When people rated Gear 2 higher than Gears 3, it kind of upset me because I know Gears 3 is a better game on every level.

1078
01:13:09,829 --> 01:13:11,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the punchline.

1079
01:13:11,926 --> 01:13:14,729
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like Eurogamer really trashed the shit out of this game, didn't it?

1080
01:13:14,769 --> 01:13:16,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Which they have done to some games.

1081
01:13:16,371 --> 01:13:17,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And that they put this game in the toilet.

1082
01:13:18,173 --> 01:13:21,036
[SPEAKER_04]: This game got an 8 out of 10 by Eurogamer.

1083
01:13:22,237 --> 01:13:23,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are haters.

1084
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:25,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the game got an 8 out of 10.

1085
01:13:27,022 --> 01:13:27,683
[SPEAKER_04]: That's stupid.

1086
01:13:28,684 --> 01:13:29,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Care to elaborate?

1087
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:30,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it stupid?

1088
01:13:31,347 --> 01:13:32,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I want someone to start this off.

1089
01:13:32,888 --> 01:13:36,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, I mean, 8 out of 10 is good.

1090
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:38,271
[SPEAKER_10]: It's well above average.

1091
01:13:39,072 --> 01:13:45,015
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, maybe it's like, oh, I wanted a 9 out of 10 or a 10 out of 10 because it was exceptional, it was perfect, we can do no wrong, maybe.

1092
01:13:45,635 --> 01:13:52,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds to me like the issue is Gears 2 must have got a 9 or a 10 from the same website, and they dared to rate this game an 8.

1093
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:53,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably.

1094
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:56,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

1095
01:13:59,989 --> 01:14:02,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Review scores you kind of have to take with a grain of salt anyway.

1096
01:14:02,751 --> 01:14:04,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not like they rated a game a 4.

1097
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:10,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were some reviews out there on the internet that rated Final Fantasy XIII a 4 out of 10.

1098
01:14:10,756 --> 01:14:11,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1099
01:14:11,537 --> 01:14:12,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at Duke Nukem Forever.

1100
01:14:12,878 --> 01:14:13,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect example.

1101
01:14:13,719 --> 01:14:16,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's a ton of shitty reviews and there's a ton of really good reviews for it.

1102
01:14:17,819 --> 01:14:19,700
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to look at your reviewer.

1103
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:29,302
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I always thought that one of the most fair reviewing systems was how GamePro used to do it.

1104
01:14:30,162 --> 01:14:32,463
[SPEAKER_04]: With their little faces, emote icons?

1105
01:14:32,483 --> 01:14:33,263
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

1106
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:37,064
[SPEAKER_10]: How they would pick one game and have five people score it.

1107
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was an EGM thing.

1108
01:14:39,161 --> 01:14:40,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was EGM, sorry.

1109
01:14:40,422 --> 01:14:41,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is basically Famitsu.

1110
01:14:41,863 --> 01:14:43,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, GamePro used to do two people.

1111
01:14:44,045 --> 01:14:44,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did they?

1112
01:14:44,686 --> 01:14:45,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Back and forth.

1113
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:55,176
[SPEAKER_10]: But I liked how you would have the main reviewer who would go over the major points in the game and then you'd have what everyone else thought of it and the average score is this.

1114
01:14:56,237 --> 01:14:57,017
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fair.

1115
01:14:58,178 --> 01:14:58,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1116
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,262
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, why does anyone give a shit what Cliffy B wants?

1117
01:15:02,342 --> 01:15:03,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Cliffy B's a fucking douchebag.

1118
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:05,581
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it comes down to.

1119
01:15:05,661 --> 01:15:06,922
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a fucking douchebag.

1120
01:15:06,942 --> 01:15:11,344
[SPEAKER_03]: He thinks he's a goddamn rock star because he has a few good games under his belt.

1121
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:11,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, great.

1122
01:15:11,985 --> 01:15:14,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, Epic Games makes some pretty cool shit.

1123
01:15:14,586 --> 01:15:16,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And you act like a fucking douchebag.

1124
01:15:16,468 --> 01:15:20,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So, wah, your game got an 8 on one website.

1125
01:15:21,051 --> 01:15:23,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Go fucking cry in a corner then, you little bitch.

1126
01:15:23,772 --> 01:15:27,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting, though, because if the game is that good, then the review shouldn't matter, right?

1127
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

1128
01:15:29,623 --> 01:15:37,925
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're so hard up on it getting an 8.0 and stuff, fine, why don't you blacklist Eurogamer then if you're going to take the high ground with that?

1129
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:39,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my game was better.

1130
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:40,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought so because I made it.

1131
01:15:41,285 --> 01:15:42,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know what?

1132
01:15:42,886 --> 01:15:48,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet the people that worked hard on Duke Nukem have ever thought it was a great game too.

1133
01:15:48,187 --> 01:15:49,687
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see them fucking crying.

1134
01:15:49,867 --> 01:15:56,288
[SPEAKER_04]: The number one movie at the box office every year is rarely the most well-reviewed.

1135
01:15:57,642 --> 01:15:58,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about that.

1136
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Because a lot of people have no taste.

1137
01:16:03,194 --> 01:16:04,597
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a fucking douchebag.

1138
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:06,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Plain and simple.

1139
01:16:07,893 --> 01:16:36,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know the guy and I don't watch a lot of television which we talked about earlier video game related stuff so I don't know I saw him once at E3 doing a demo I think at the first Gears of War game like a long time ago he seemed fine to me whatever I don't got a problem but I don't think an 8 out of 10 makes somebody a hater I understand you know I understand he's passionate about his game that's fine but you know what if I made a fucking game and one site reviewed it you know a point lower than everybody else

1140
01:16:37,052 --> 01:17:04,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't care I'd be like okay that's their opinion fine you know what if everybody rated it like a 1 or something like that or if like they came out and said I fucking hate the Gears of War series so I'm gonna give it a 1 out of 10 or something like that then yeah he could be pissed off but 8 out of 10 is just fine I don't understand what the big deal is well it was like when the websites were giving Final Fantasy 13 a 4 out of 10 I was like okay these are the websites I can't trust their reviews ever again because they're smoking crack over there they don't like the same games I like clearly remember

1141
01:17:04,266 --> 01:17:04,586
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1142
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:32,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but if you're a gamer that's like, well, this thing can get a 9 out of 10, I can't buy this game.

1143
01:17:33,003 --> 01:17:35,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I don't think there's anyone out there that's like that.

1144
01:17:35,647 --> 01:17:41,214
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to buy Gears of War because you like Gears of War, it's not because someone gave it an 8 or a 9 out of 10.

1145
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:43,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think an 8 out of 10 is just fine.

1146
01:17:43,457 --> 01:17:46,381
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact that he just went out there and said, Wee!

1147
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:47,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

1148
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:48,422
[SPEAKER_03]: 8 out of 10!

1149
01:17:48,662 --> 01:17:50,002
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what makes him a douchebag.

1150
01:17:50,102 --> 01:17:50,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1151
01:17:51,403 --> 01:17:57,684
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.org.com says, You should never base your views on a game based on a game review.

1152
01:17:58,045 --> 01:18:01,666
[SPEAKER_04]: You play these games with an open mind and form your own opinion about it.

1153
01:18:02,446 --> 01:18:07,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm mostly inclined to agree with that statement, and in theory, that's a really good statement.

1154
01:18:07,628 --> 01:18:09,888
[SPEAKER_04]: But the only thing is that games cost $60.

1155
01:18:11,229 --> 01:18:15,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're on the fence about a game, you gotta go off something.

1156
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:20,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer that to be hands-on experience, be it game rental or game kiosk or something.

1157
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:30,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, usually I only drop $60 on a game on launch day because I've either A, played it at a trade show, or B, really liked other games in the series, so I've got to get it.

1158
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:33,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Civ V, I bought right when it came out because I like...

1159
01:18:33,857 --> 01:18:47,397
[SPEAKER_04]: the other Civ games Skyrim I will buy day one because it's an Elder Scrolls game I've seen all the stuff online I don't think it's going to disappoint me but games I'm on the fence about maybe I want to see some reviews on before I spend the money on it you know

1160
01:18:48,393 --> 01:18:48,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of 10

1161
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:09,253
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll like this game if you like Japanese RPGs.

1162
01:19:09,393 --> 01:19:10,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, maybe.

1163
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:18,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And then sometimes there's a game where it's like, wow, I don't care what type of games you're into, you've got to check this out because it is doing something that no other game does.

1164
01:19:18,437 --> 01:19:18,857
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1165
01:19:19,378 --> 01:19:22,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think that is the best way to sum up a game.

1166
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:27,522
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's more fair, but the typical person wants to just say, oh, too long, didn't read, and go to the end.

1167
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:30,423
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't translate that into a Metacritic score, right?

1168
01:19:30,784 --> 01:19:30,984
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1169
01:19:31,889 --> 01:19:33,330
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1170
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:56,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you... Well, hold on.

1171
01:19:57,414 --> 01:20:00,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Metacritic's calling it an 80, but I don't know Destructoid's review scale.

1172
01:20:00,197 --> 01:20:02,079
[SPEAKER_04]: That could also be 4 out of 5 stars.

1173
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:04,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's still 4 out of 5.

1174
01:20:04,442 --> 01:20:06,986
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not 5 out of 5 or 4 and a half out of 5.

1175
01:20:07,406 --> 01:20:07,867
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still 80%.

1176
01:20:08,988 --> 01:20:09,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what?

1177
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:17,235
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a friend who basically, like, whenever, you know, we talk about a movie or something, he's always talking about, oh, well, Rotten Tomatoes rated this and blah blah.

1178
01:20:17,255 --> 01:20:19,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, yeah, but what did they say about the movie?

1179
01:20:19,757 --> 01:20:20,818
[SPEAKER_10]: What did they say about the acting?

1180
01:20:20,838 --> 01:20:21,558
[SPEAKER_10]: What did they say about this?

1181
01:20:21,579 --> 01:20:23,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't really give a crap what the score is.

1182
01:20:24,021 --> 01:20:31,947
[SPEAKER_10]: I care what the part, because Vinny and you know me, I like, you know, movies that people have blasted, if there's fun parts in them, I'll watch the movie again.

1183
01:20:32,107 --> 01:20:32,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go see it again.

1184
01:20:33,408 --> 01:20:35,090
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care, because I enjoyed it.

1185
01:20:35,822 --> 01:20:37,663
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite movies are like stupid movies.

1186
01:20:38,143 --> 01:20:40,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Mystery Science Theater 3000 types of events.

1187
01:20:40,505 --> 01:20:41,805
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I like Showgirls so much.

1188
01:20:42,166 --> 01:20:45,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Showgirls is a terrible fucking movie, but it is so much fun to watch.

1189
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:45,948
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1190
01:20:46,548 --> 01:20:47,128
[SPEAKER_10]: With friends.

1191
01:20:47,208 --> 01:20:49,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you remember my bachelorette party.

1192
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:50,470
[SPEAKER_10]: What did we watch?

1193
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:52,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Barbarella and Xanadu.

1194
01:20:52,171 --> 01:20:53,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember that.

1195
01:20:53,332 --> 01:20:53,732
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.

1196
01:20:53,752 --> 01:20:54,733
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we went to the goth club.

1197
01:20:54,753 --> 01:20:55,773
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.

1198
01:20:56,013 --> 01:20:58,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was the last time I went to the goth club was your bachelorette party.

1199
01:20:58,415 --> 01:21:00,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I think that was the last time I went too.

1200
01:21:01,316 --> 01:21:01,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1201
01:21:02,017 --> 01:21:02,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, to that one anyway.

1202
01:21:03,157 --> 01:21:03,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to the other ones.

1203
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,621
[SPEAKER_04]: let's move on, let's move on DarkSakura, you got a quick story for us and then release dates

1204
01:21:08,095 --> 01:21:16,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, basically, Microsoft is saying that Windows 8 will support Xbox Live, but they're not really saying anything else about games for Windows Live.

1205
01:21:17,318 --> 01:21:26,201
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just basically like, their actual spokesperson said, and I quote, we currently have nothing to announce beyond the statement that Major Nelson posted on his blog.

1206
01:21:27,242 --> 01:21:35,725
[SPEAKER_10]: So, what I'm thinking is that you're going to be able to manage your Xbox Live account and maybe some games will cross over.

1207
01:21:36,921 --> 01:21:43,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I could see some type of messenger or video chat tie-in or Skype or whatever ultimate direction they go in.

1208
01:21:43,104 --> 01:21:48,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just a way for when you are signing into your computer, you are still within the Xbox Live network.

1209
01:21:48,766 --> 01:21:57,270
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm wondering about is that does this mean that they've talked about going more an app-style direction with Windows 8, which obviously is something that-

1210
01:21:58,510 --> 01:21:59,210
[SPEAKER_04]: You can, you can.

1211
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:01,991
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're calling the desktop is like a type of app.

1212
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:03,192
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird.

1213
01:22:03,472 --> 01:22:08,894
[SPEAKER_04]: But obviously they're going that more Apple route, which is not too surprising, especially because this runs on tablets.

1214
01:22:08,914 --> 01:22:09,774
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's my question.

1215
01:22:10,234 --> 01:22:20,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean, and I'm totally inferring here, but does that mean that apps will be run in Microsoft Points and maybe your points are used across systems?

1216
01:22:20,758 --> 01:22:21,778
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be very convenient.

1217
01:22:21,798 --> 01:22:23,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's how they did it with Zoom, I thought.

1218
01:22:23,459 --> 01:22:26,140
[SPEAKER_03]: The Zoom marketplace wasn't all together.

1219
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,420
[SPEAKER_04]: It could, yeah, and it could.

1220
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:31,382
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, you know, games for Windows Live or whatever ran in real dollars.

1221
01:22:32,302 --> 01:22:35,503
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Live does use real dollars in one portion.

1222
01:22:35,563 --> 01:22:37,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the buying the old games.

1223
01:22:38,324 --> 01:22:38,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1224
01:22:38,944 --> 01:22:39,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Games on demand.

1225
01:22:39,504 --> 01:22:40,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Games on demand, thank you.

1226
01:22:40,464 --> 01:22:42,805
[SPEAKER_04]: It uses real dollars as opposed to the Microsoft points.

1227
01:22:43,405 --> 01:22:44,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So it could go either way.

1228
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:44,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1229
01:22:45,047 --> 01:22:47,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and with points, you know, you're always going to have leftover.

1230
01:22:47,449 --> 01:22:48,590
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to have an odd amount.

1231
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:52,153
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they've arranged it that way to where you buy them, you're going to have some leftover.

1232
01:22:52,633 --> 01:22:55,656
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to get anything else, you've still got to have that odd amount.

1233
01:22:55,736 --> 01:22:56,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Not anymore, actually.

1234
01:22:57,158 --> 01:22:57,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Not anymore.

1235
01:22:58,118 --> 01:23:01,522
[SPEAKER_03]: They have changed the denominations that you can buy.

1236
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:01,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1237
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:07,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but depending on what you're buying, I still find myself left with like 80 points floating out there.

1238
01:23:07,346 --> 01:23:12,489
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're buying a card or something like that where it's $20, $50 increments, then yes, you may be left over.

1239
01:23:12,769 --> 01:23:14,450
[SPEAKER_03]: But they actually do have it now where you can buy 800, 400.

1240
01:23:16,672 --> 01:23:20,454
[SPEAKER_04]: But they want you to do that where like, oh, I have 80 points in my account.

1241
01:23:21,075 --> 01:23:24,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I could get this stupid little hat for my avatar for 80 Microsoft points.

1242
01:23:24,177 --> 01:23:25,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I never think of that.

1243
01:23:25,558 --> 01:23:26,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I never think that at all.

1244
01:23:26,518 --> 01:23:26,819
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't.

1245
01:23:26,839 --> 01:23:27,739
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of people do.

1246
01:23:27,759 --> 01:23:28,420
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of people do.

1247
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:41,513
[SPEAKER_03]: My only crazy purchase I ever did on PlayStation Network was dressing my character up like a hobo Santa and I am still hobo Santa in home which I have not been to forever so probably dead hobo Santa at this point.

1248
01:23:41,721 --> 01:23:46,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and to be fair, I did buy the Taylor Swift microphone for my avatar on Xbox Live.

1249
01:23:46,745 --> 01:23:52,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, the only thing that I bought is I had leftover points and I bought one of the steampunk tops just because I thought it was really cute.

1250
01:23:53,031 --> 01:23:55,553
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've all been guilty of buying some stupid shit online.

1251
01:23:57,175 --> 01:23:58,376
[SPEAKER_04]: But Hope Santa is not free.

1252
01:23:58,916 --> 01:24:03,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of buying stupid shit, let's travel around the globe and talk about what games are coming out real soon.

1253
01:24:06,102 --> 01:24:14,465

01:27:41,197 --> 01:27:41,838
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a ways off.

1278
01:27:41,858 --> 01:27:43,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I just was reminded of it reading these dates.

1279

[SPEAKER_04]: On the Wii this week, a Biohazard Chronicles value pack that comes with Umbrella Chronicles and Darkside Chronicles.

[SPEAKER_04]: These are Resident Evil games, of course.

1281
01:27:53,729 --> 01:27:55,391
[SPEAKER_04]: They call them Biohazard over there in Japan.

1282
01:27:56,411 --> 01:28:02,333
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 3DS this week, Loki's favorite, Frogger 3D comes out on the 3DS this week.

1283
01:28:02,873 --> 01:28:12,555
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't like that, maybe you'll like Senran Kagura, Shujotachi no Shine comes out this week, which is a, I don't know, what is this?

1284
01:28:12,595 --> 01:28:15,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Little schoolgirls partying in 3D.

1285
01:28:16,196 --> 01:28:17,696
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much what it is, aren't they all?

1286
01:28:18,256 --> 01:28:21,077
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and I think that's it.

1287
01:28:22,737 --> 01:28:23,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's it.

1288
01:28:23,297 --> 01:28:25,298
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go to Europe.

1289
01:28:26,824 --> 01:28:28,385
[SPEAKER_10]: In Europe, we have games.

1290
01:28:29,106 --> 01:28:31,447
[SPEAKER_10]: And starting on, when does the week start again?

1291
01:28:31,547 --> 01:28:32,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, today.

1292
01:28:32,848 --> 01:28:46,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Starting on the 20th, we have Burnout Crash on 360 and PlayStation 3, Fallout New Vegas Lonesome Road on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, Gears of War 3, and Resident Evil Revival Selection.

1293
01:28:47,537 --> 01:28:49,438
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 21st, we have Rotastic.

1294
01:28:50,118 --> 01:28:53,721
[SPEAKER_10]: And the 23rd, we have Supremacy MMA, F1 2011, and that's it.

1295
01:28:57,802 --> 01:29:03,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, just a few more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.

1296
01:29:03,383 --> 01:29:04,123
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, Loki?

1297
01:29:04,743 --> 01:29:15,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I think we talked a little bit about it last week, how there was a cable company in Canada that was actually throttling internet speeds with gaming on them.

1298
01:29:16,105 --> 01:29:18,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually a little bit of a follow-up to that.

1299
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:24,427
[SPEAKER_03]: The Canadian Radio and Television Telecommunications Commission, that's a mouthful,

1300
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:40,350
[SPEAKER_03]: cited that Rogers' own policy which claims that the online games like World of Warcraft should not be throttled and telling the company it has now until September 27th to present a plan that keeps World of Warcraft traffic and that of other games unthrottled.

1301
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's good news for Canada.

1302
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:53,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Wish we had people that actually had power over here in the United States do that kind of thing because internet cable companies are running like crazy and

1303
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:55,957
[SPEAKER_03]: GameAustralia GameAustralia

1304
01:30:19,744 --> 01:30:20,425
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is this?

1305
01:30:42,202 --> 01:30:47,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Clearly this is all just to be provocative and I'm kind of surprised no one over here has tried this yet.

1306
01:30:48,326 --> 01:30:50,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Just getting people talking and so forth.

1307
01:30:51,467 --> 01:30:53,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, that's really all there is to it.

1308
01:30:53,168 --> 01:30:57,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, to look like a wiener and so forth.

1309
01:30:58,007 --> 01:31:01,109
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it is drawing complaints, of course.

1310
01:31:01,309 --> 01:31:02,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody likes this.

1311
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:05,992
[SPEAKER_04]: How dare you use two fingers to look like a butt in the cutout of the card?

1312
01:31:06,673 --> 01:31:11,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Complaints have been filed with the ACCC, that is the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

1313
01:31:12,597 --> 01:31:15,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Game has not acknowledged or commented on these complaints.

1314
01:31:16,359 --> 01:31:22,303
[SPEAKER_04]: When questioned about these cards, they just talk about how great the reward program is and all the stuff that they can get back.

1315
01:31:22,784 --> 01:31:27,367
[SPEAKER_04]: We've decided to relaunch the reward card program with its extra benefits, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1316
01:31:27,927 --> 01:31:29,128
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wiener is you

1317
01:31:49,168 --> 01:31:56,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, a winner is you right now because right now we're going to go through the gaming archives and find a classic game of the week.

1318
01:31:58,412 --> 01:32:05,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week DarkSakura dives into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks, hey, you kids need to show this game more respect.

1319
01:32:05,794 --> 01:32:07,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw the Vita and screw the 3DS.

1320
01:32:07,915 --> 01:32:10,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in my day, this game was the bee's knees.

1321
01:32:11,716 --> 01:32:12,437
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1322
01:32:13,437 --> 01:32:16,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I can make better boobs in chat than Kevin68 can.

1323
01:32:17,403 --> 01:32:19,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, my boobs are a lot better.

1324
01:32:21,848 --> 01:32:23,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Today's game is The Sims.

1325
01:32:25,794 --> 01:32:30,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, The Sims, the game that started it all and why we're all playing that stupid game on Facebook.

1326
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:36,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, The Sims is a game where... Is this actual game noises?

1327
01:32:36,564 --> 01:32:36,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1328
01:32:36,845 --> 01:32:38,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's actual game noises.

1329
01:32:38,066 --> 01:32:40,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're playing in a fast forward, which is like the best one I could find.

1330
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:40,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1331
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:44,815
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a life simulation game, pretty much.

1332
01:32:45,055 --> 01:32:49,620
[SPEAKER_10]: It was designed by Will Wright, which you know what else he did.

1333
01:32:50,161 --> 01:32:50,622
[SPEAKER_10]: SimCity.

1334
01:32:51,082 --> 01:32:52,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Bob the Sim or something.

1335
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:23,251
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've got NPCs and you've got your actual Sim.

1336
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:26,032
[SPEAKER_10]: And your Sim can interact with the NPCs and get married.

1337
01:33:26,092 --> 01:33:29,514
[SPEAKER_10]: You eventually will be able to control the Sim that they marry, blah blah.

1338
01:33:30,374 --> 01:33:31,774
[SPEAKER_10]: But you have different stages of life.

1339
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:34,635
[SPEAKER_10]: You have an infant, a child, and an adult.

1340
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:36,236
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's just in the Sims.

1341
01:33:37,296 --> 01:33:41,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Babies will grow into children and children and adults never age.

1342
01:33:41,878 --> 01:33:52,087
[SPEAKER_10]: So that means that they can stay in their little lifespan indefinitely, but they can die from different stuff like burning to death, drowning in a pool, starving, dying from disease, and the Grim Reaper will come and take them away.

1343
01:33:52,547 --> 01:34:00,654
[SPEAKER_10]: But you have to win against them in rock, paper, scissors, or your sin will actually die and stay dead and your tombstone will show up.

1344
01:34:02,338 --> 01:34:06,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I like in Sims 3 how, you know, if you kill a Sim, they'll just start haunting the house.

1345
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:06,702
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty awesome.

1346
01:34:07,482 --> 01:34:12,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, you've got Live Mode, which is where you do all your gameplay.

1347
01:34:12,827 --> 01:34:16,330
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you have Build and Buy Mode, where Build Mode is where you build your house.

1348
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:22,455
[SPEAKER_10]: You start off with 20,000 simoleons, which is their money system.

1349
01:34:23,255 --> 01:34:26,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And you've got Buy Mode, where you can buy house parts and do stuff.

1350
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:31,307
[SPEAKER_10]: So in your lives, your sims do have a little bit of free will.

1351
01:34:32,008 --> 01:34:33,770
[SPEAKER_10]: They can, you know, autonomously do stuff.

1352
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:36,814
[SPEAKER_10]: You can control, I think, the level of their free will.

1353
01:34:39,718 --> 01:34:42,501
[SPEAKER_10]: But basically, you still have to make them pee.

1354
01:34:42,801 --> 01:34:46,927
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to make them find a job and pay their bills and work out and, you know, make babies and shit.

1355
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:49,380
[SPEAKER_10]: You!

1356
01:34:49,621 --> 01:34:50,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Go make a baby!

1357
01:34:52,521 --> 01:35:03,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was funny, because this actually mentions that their system of needs follow Maslow's hierarchy of needs, in which the physiological needs must be satisfied before other needs can be attended to.

1358
01:35:04,546 --> 01:35:11,888
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, they'll piss on the floor if you don't tell them to go to the bathroom.

1359
01:35:11,948 --> 01:35:14,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you forget to build a toilet, which I had a friend do.

1360
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:17,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if they don't eat, they'll die of starvation.

1361
01:35:17,472 --> 01:35:21,275
[SPEAKER_10]: And their needs, their physical needs are what govern their mood.

1362
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:26,060
[SPEAKER_10]: So the more that their needs are taken care of, the better mood that they'll be in.

1363
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:26,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got needs.

1364
01:35:27,502 --> 01:35:34,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, for example, if you're playing the SimSocial, you know how you don't get inspired until all your needs are in the green?

1365
01:35:34,969 --> 01:35:35,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Same diff.

1366
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:36,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you'll be happy.

1367
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:40,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking I'm done with SimSocial and I'm going to block it on Facebook.

1368
01:35:40,771 --> 01:35:41,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

1369
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:42,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I like my house.

1370
01:35:43,052 --> 01:35:44,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate the spammy spam.

1371
01:35:44,832 --> 01:35:46,132
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting bad.

1372
01:35:47,893 --> 01:35:54,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know they put a feedback window where you can leave them feedback about not liking any of that?

1373
01:35:54,795 --> 01:35:56,595
[SPEAKER_10]: So you might want to try leaving feedback first.

1374
01:35:56,635 --> 01:35:57,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I got feedback.

1375
01:35:57,475 --> 01:35:57,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Block.

1376
01:36:01,388 --> 01:36:07,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, so basically, it's kind of like an artificial life program, if you look at it in that respect.

1377
01:36:08,072 --> 01:36:09,932
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can keep playing and playing.

1378
01:36:10,253 --> 01:36:12,934
[SPEAKER_10]: In the first Sims, I used to just kill people all the time.

1379
01:36:12,954 --> 01:36:16,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody did that with the Sims at first.

1380
01:36:16,776 --> 01:36:19,497
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to create creative death traps for your Sims.

1381
01:36:19,598 --> 01:36:21,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a way of getting out of stress.

1382
01:36:21,639 --> 01:36:23,800
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my friends actually had what she called the House of Death.

1383
01:36:25,241 --> 01:36:29,884
[SPEAKER_10]: And like, it was all kinds of ways that, you know, they could set themselves on fire and things.

1384
01:36:30,164 --> 01:36:31,866
[SPEAKER_10]: And she had a graveyard in front of the house.

1385
01:36:33,487 --> 01:36:35,068
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Julie's house, Dan.

1386
01:36:35,128 --> 01:36:37,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure you remember that.

1387
01:36:38,611 --> 01:36:47,698
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, with your kids, they can study at home and keep their grades up, but if they miss too many school days, they are transported to a military academy indefinitely.

1388
01:36:49,341 --> 01:36:52,868
[SPEAKER_10]: and they can't prepare food or earn money so basically they're useless.

1389
01:36:54,011 --> 01:36:55,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Children are useless.

1390
01:36:57,128 --> 01:37:00,712
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, basically, your sims can fight with other sims.

1391
01:37:00,772 --> 01:37:01,593
[SPEAKER_10]: They do stuff.

1392
01:37:02,314 --> 01:37:08,601
[SPEAKER_10]: And they can actually be locked into an undead state by keeping them from leaving the hot tub or the bed.

1393
01:37:09,241 --> 01:37:14,026
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they'll keep interacting with other people, but they won't be able to leave.

1394
01:37:14,667 --> 01:37:15,508
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't leave.

1395
01:37:15,648 --> 01:37:16,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And they don't prune or anything?

1396
01:37:17,410 --> 01:37:17,991
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't die.

1397
01:37:18,371 --> 01:37:18,992
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just undead.

1398
01:37:20,695 --> 01:37:25,357
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, in the first Sims, it actually did use a combination of 2D and 3D.

1399
01:37:25,457 --> 01:37:28,738
[SPEAKER_10]: The Sims themselves are 3D, but everything in it are pre-rendered.

1400
01:37:30,559 --> 01:37:33,080
[SPEAKER_10]: So the game clearly has been a success.

1401
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:38,882
[SPEAKER_10]: It sold more than 6.3 million copies worldwide.

1402
01:37:40,043 --> 01:37:40,563
[SPEAKER_10]: And as of...

1403
01:37:44,179 --> 01:37:48,342
[SPEAKER_10]: As of February 7, 2005, that's 16 million copies shipped worldwide.

1404
01:37:49,362 --> 01:37:51,784
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, it's been highly pirated.

1405
01:37:52,884 --> 01:37:58,948
[SPEAKER_10]: And the music in the game was done by Jerry Martin, Mark Russo, Kirk R. Casey, and Dick Spruce.

1406
01:37:59,228 --> 01:38:02,831
[SPEAKER_10]: And these people have actually, I think, gone through and done all the other sim music.

1407
01:38:02,851 --> 01:38:04,612
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can actually buy soundtracks of all the sim music.

1408
01:38:05,012 --> 01:38:07,774
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's got its own little unique, perky little style, you know?

1409
01:38:08,474 --> 01:38:08,994
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cute.

1410
01:38:09,635 --> 01:38:13,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, this is the part that I am interested in, in particular, is Simlish.

1411
01:38:14,796 --> 01:38:21,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, they wanted to avoid a way to, um... They wanted to avoid localization of spoken dialogue.

1412
01:38:22,559 --> 01:38:24,680
[SPEAKER_10]: So the best way for them to do it was to create a language.

1413
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:27,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Simlish... Can I play some of the songs in Simlish?

1414
01:38:27,501 --> 01:38:28,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're really bad.

1415
01:38:28,962 --> 01:38:29,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Find the Lily Allen one.

1416
01:38:30,682 --> 01:38:33,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Find the one for Smile, because it was actually really cute and the video is adorable.

1417
01:38:37,227 --> 01:38:37,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that it?

1418
01:38:38,308 --> 01:38:38,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1419
01:38:38,908 --> 01:38:40,089
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a Nelly Furtado one, by the way.

1420
01:38:40,109 --> 01:38:42,472
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of reminds me of Kidz Bop.

1421
01:38:42,492 --> 01:38:44,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.

1422
01:38:55,944 --> 01:38:57,565
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nutley Furtado was actually kind of cool too.

1423
01:38:57,625 --> 01:38:58,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Baby language bop.

1424
01:38:59,406 --> 01:39:03,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the whole point with Simlish, oh, and didn't Katy Perry do Hot and Cold?

1425
01:39:03,667 --> 01:39:07,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, here's one for Salacious Pop, who I know is a huge fan of this artist.

1426
01:39:14,871 --> 01:39:19,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny, that's what I hear when I hear this song.

1427
01:39:20,133 --> 01:39:23,974
[SPEAKER_04]: If you play it backwards, it's devil speak, and that's why she's popular.

1428
01:39:25,168 --> 01:39:27,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, they're... Listen, she's... Listen, play it backwards.

1429
01:39:28,533 --> 01:39:31,739
[SPEAKER_04]: She's saying that she killed Michael Jackson to get that record.

1430
01:39:32,961 --> 01:39:34,303
[SPEAKER_10]: So bad.

1431
01:39:34,343 --> 01:39:36,947
[SPEAKER_10]: But actually, these little videos that they did for him were really cute.

1432
01:39:40,818 --> 01:39:43,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, anyway, Simlish is really a bunch of gibberish.

1433
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:50,803
[SPEAKER_10]: But they were gonna actually base it, they created it by experimenting with Ukrainian, French, and Tagalog.

1434
01:39:51,464 --> 01:39:59,928
[SPEAKER_10]: And he wanted to base it off of Navajo, but instead just went for gibberish that sounds like the same inflections that you'd hear in everyday speech.

1435
01:40:00,188 --> 01:40:02,630
[SPEAKER_04]: They really got those bitches to sing in a baby language?

1436
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:03,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

1437
01:40:05,111 --> 01:40:07,733
[SPEAKER_04]: How did somebody convince Katy Perry that's a good idea?

1438
01:40:07,753 --> 01:40:08,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1439
01:40:08,533 --> 01:40:09,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Cha-ching!

1440
01:40:11,336 --> 01:40:12,758
[SPEAKER_03]: You like money, bitch, right?

1441
01:40:12,778 --> 01:40:13,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some money!

1442
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:15,921
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a special about it.

1443
01:40:16,602 --> 01:40:20,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched one of the behind-the-scenes for The Sims 3 about them recording some of the songs in Simlish.

1444
01:40:21,407 --> 01:40:25,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically, they are just nonsensical things that fit the phrasing of the original song.

1445
01:40:26,713 --> 01:40:28,935
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're like, you know, it was kind of fun.

1446
01:40:29,115 --> 01:40:31,818
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it's kind of neat to see the Sim version of me.

1447
01:40:31,978 --> 01:40:36,022
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, so, like, besides being paid, I've seen a lot amounts of money.

1448
01:40:36,042 --> 01:40:37,203
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they said it was fun.

1449
01:40:37,223 --> 01:40:39,165
[SPEAKER_10]: They just showed what the lyric sheet looked like.

1450
01:40:39,185 --> 01:40:43,329
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was all, me ma boo, ma ma ma me, horgy wow.

1451
01:40:44,029 --> 01:40:46,812
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, whatever they say in Simlish.

1452
01:40:48,144 --> 01:41:00,134
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um... The different expansions were Live Enlarge, House Party, Hot Date, Vacation, Unleashed, Superstar, Superstar, and Make It Magic, which was the last one.

1453
01:41:00,234 --> 01:41:01,795
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Sims 2 came out.

1454
01:41:03,077 --> 01:41:04,518
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we have Sims 3 now.

1455
01:41:05,238 --> 01:41:08,041
[SPEAKER_10]: And, honestly, I think Sims 2 was kind of better than Sims 3.

1456
01:41:08,781 --> 01:41:09,562
[SPEAKER_10]: But I really like Sims 3.

1457
01:41:09,862 --> 01:41:11,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Except it's so fucking slow!

1458
01:41:12,725 --> 01:41:12,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah!

1459
01:41:12,845 --> 01:41:12,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah!

1460
01:41:14,113 --> 01:41:16,835
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1461
01:41:37,671 --> 01:42:04,216
[SPEAKER_10]: in Sims 2 they had custom build the fucking universe they had a custom Sims maker where you could try on skins and different things and really just do all kinds of neat stuff to them and now like in Sims 3 you can adjust their boob size there's model modifiers built in like you can change all kinds of features on their face and everything but people have gone further and made boob modifiers and butt modifiers and hip modifiers and

1462
01:42:04,756 --> 01:42:11,741
[SPEAKER_10]: There's even elven ear modifiers where you can give them a combination between Tolkien-style elven ears and WoW-style elven ears.

1463
01:42:12,242 --> 01:42:13,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you can just give them really huge Dumbo ears.

1464
01:42:14,664 --> 01:42:17,506
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's just, you can farm.

1465
01:42:18,627 --> 01:42:32,737
[SPEAKER_10]: You can, now, the first thing that I did whenever, in Sims 3 now, whenever I just, you know, met some random person and ended up marrying them, like, my Sim was carrying around like a relationship with five girls and two dudes.

1466
01:42:33,878 --> 01:42:35,400
[SPEAKER_10]: for some time and finally ended up marrying some girl.

1467
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:36,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Sim slut.

1468
01:42:37,802 --> 01:42:44,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally ended up marrying some girl, except her model was really crappy, so you can actually go into the stylist mode.

1469
01:42:44,888 --> 01:42:48,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you saying you bought your wife a ton of plastic surgery to fix her up?

1470
01:42:48,271 --> 01:42:48,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did.

1471
01:42:49,592 --> 01:42:55,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I made my wife look not... Honestly, the original Sim faces in Sims 3 were really derpy.

1472
01:42:56,758 --> 01:42:59,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Now there's all kinds of special skins and hairs and stuff that doesn't look too derpy.

1473
01:43:01,682 --> 01:43:03,463
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, the first Sims is what started it all.

1474
01:43:03,943 --> 01:43:04,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played a good bit of that.

1475
01:43:05,004 --> 01:43:06,084
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played a lot of Sims 2.

1476
01:43:06,384 --> 01:43:10,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Sims 2 was the one where they figured out how to crack the animation code and started having dirty things.

1477
01:43:11,086 --> 01:43:16,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you could buy dildos and a rug that had butt sex animation and all kinds of stuff.

1478
01:43:17,828 --> 01:43:24,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is a well-timed classic game of the week because, you know, The Sims is or was like the biggest PC game ever.

1479
01:43:24,771 --> 01:43:27,953
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have got beat by World of Warcraft eventually, I don't know, or one of the Blizzard games.

1480
01:43:28,033 --> 01:43:31,134
[SPEAKER_04]: But The Sims is still a huge, huge PC game.

1481
01:43:31,174 --> 01:43:41,139
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously with The Sims Social now being like a huge Facebook game, despite the fact that that thing spams the shit out of all your friends while on Facebook, it is topical to make sure you know where that comes from.

1482
01:43:42,499 --> 01:43:45,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure everybody has that story about, you know, terrorizing Sims.

1483
01:43:46,286 --> 01:43:51,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Now here's actually a little bit of news that I just found out I wasn't aware of.

1484
01:43:51,649 --> 01:43:57,612
[SPEAKER_10]: On May 25, 2007, there's a Sims film rights were purchased by Twin Century Fox being written by Brian Lynch.

1485
01:43:57,852 --> 01:43:59,653
[SPEAKER_04]: The fuck would you do in a Sims movie?

1486
01:43:59,773 --> 01:44:00,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1487
01:44:00,173 --> 01:44:01,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a movie about life.

1488
01:44:02,334 --> 01:44:04,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's walking around with a little plumbob over their head.

1489
01:44:04,775 --> 01:44:07,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's like a cartoon or something.

1490
01:44:07,897 --> 01:44:14,000
[SPEAKER_10]: And the original Sims site by Maxis has been disconnected for 11 years and is now replaced by the Sims 3 site.

1491
01:44:16,198 --> 01:44:16,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1492
01:44:17,379 --> 01:44:18,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that it on Sims?

1493
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:19,020
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1494
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:21,282
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1495
01:44:21,402 --> 01:44:22,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Bork Me Do.

1496
01:44:22,503 --> 01:44:23,063
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sims.

1497
01:44:23,143 --> 01:44:23,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Bork Me Do.

1498
01:44:24,164 --> 01:44:27,726
[SPEAKER_04]: By Maxis for the PC, although now it's all EA.

1499
01:44:27,766 --> 01:44:30,788
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all part of that big, you know, glomerate.

1500
01:44:31,849 --> 01:44:34,932
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.

1501
01:44:34,952 --> 01:44:35,752
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

1502
01:44:35,772 --> 01:44:45,540
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got plenty more coming in Part B. We're going to talk a little bit about a new tablet coming out that's very interesting, something that Microsoft's launching at the end of the year, and somebody whining about secondhand sales.

1503
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:51,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the FUs of the week, your calls, rapid-fire news, and much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1504
01:44:57,831 --> 01:45:00,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1505
01:45:00,412 --> 01:45:07,054
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live on this September the 18th of 2011 with the 428th episode of our program.

1506
01:45:07,495 --> 01:45:13,777
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a pretty fun Part A so far, talking about the latest in 3DS as well as Vita and reviews.

1507
01:45:14,037 --> 01:45:17,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, there was just a bunch of stuff in Part A tonight, so let's see if Part B will be as much fun.

1508
01:45:17,698 --> 01:45:20,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget your phone calls coming up later in the show at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1509
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:25,282
[SPEAKER_04]: or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1510
01:45:25,302 --> 01:45:32,746
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also going to get to those emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and Twitter topics, Twitter.com slash OLR.

1511
01:45:32,806 --> 01:45:35,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to get in your Twitter topics now, it would be a great time.

1512
01:45:35,588 --> 01:45:37,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of looking a little thin on Twitter right now.

1513
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:40,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess still everybody's being distracted by the Emmys.

1514
01:45:40,852 --> 01:45:41,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Email's pretty thin too.

1515
01:45:41,932 --> 01:45:42,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just spoil it for you.

1516
01:45:42,833 --> 01:45:44,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Modern Family won everything.

1517
01:45:44,534 --> 01:45:45,494
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what I heard.

1518
01:45:45,595 --> 01:45:45,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1519
01:45:45,975 --> 01:45:46,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really read up.

1520
01:45:46,995 --> 01:45:48,977
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a funny show though, I guess, if you're going to watch something.

1521
01:45:49,657 --> 01:45:51,938
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get into some rapid-fire news, Loki.

1522
01:45:52,878 --> 01:45:57,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Saints Row III, of course, it was being shown at a Tokyo game show.

1523
01:45:57,559 --> 01:46:09,123
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, really, it's a game that's kind of more for Western audiences, but one man in particular, though, in Japan, is very interested in the series, and he's kind of crazy himself.

1524
01:46:10,063 --> 01:46:23,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomonobu Itagaki, you may remember him as the driving force behind Team Ninja and the Dead or Alive series and now his new game, The Devil's Third.

1525
01:46:25,357 --> 01:46:26,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1526
01:46:46,804 --> 01:46:47,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1527
01:46:47,224 --> 01:46:47,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta love it.

1528
01:46:47,685 --> 01:46:48,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1529
01:46:49,126 --> 01:46:49,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty sweet.

1530
01:46:50,587 --> 01:46:53,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other cool stuff was being shown off at Tokyo Game Show.

1531
01:46:53,669 --> 01:46:54,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Draco.

1532
01:46:55,050 --> 01:47:03,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And what Project Draco is, it's kind of like a spiritual successor or inspired by Panzer Dragoon game.

1533
01:47:03,895 --> 01:47:05,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be a Kinect title.

1534
01:47:05,437 --> 01:47:07,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

1535
01:47:08,278 --> 01:47:09,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And looks pretty cool.

1536
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:15,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very much like Panzer Dragoon based on the video that I've seen for it.

1537
01:47:17,129 --> 01:47:17,857
[SPEAKER_03]: very very cool

1538
01:47:18,837 --> 01:47:47,343
[SPEAKER_03]: and then this is kind of neat they've done a remake of Smash Brothers called Super Smash Land not Nintendo this guy named Dan Fornes he put out Super Smash Land features 11 different stages 6 brawlers including Mega Man classic arcade mode and multiplayer up to 4 people and they also have I guess a polygon team style endless mode as well

1539
01:47:48,342 --> 01:47:49,543
[SPEAKER_03]: with online leaderboards.

1540
01:47:50,084 --> 01:47:52,125
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can go check out the full game.

1541
01:47:52,266 --> 01:47:59,052
[SPEAKER_03]: They have it available to download as well over at PixieGeek.com.

1542
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:09,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it now before the season desists.

1543
01:48:09,701 --> 01:48:10,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.

1544
01:48:10,741 --> 01:48:15,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is done in the style of the Game Boy, so all that monochrome, grayish-green, I guess.

1545
01:48:17,465 --> 01:48:24,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try to get that chat to the chat room as well as the Tumblr, which I keep forgetting to plug, but it is there at orangelaundry.com.

1546
01:48:24,630 --> 01:48:28,912
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a link on the left side called Extended Play.

1547
01:48:29,353 --> 01:48:34,536
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a link to our Tumblr, orangelaundry.tumblr.com, because we're hipster as hell and have a Tumblr.

1548
01:48:36,656 --> 01:48:37,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's it for your news, too, isn't it?

1549
01:48:38,417 --> 01:48:39,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get to my rapid-fire news.

1550
01:48:39,718 --> 01:48:40,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band!

1551
01:48:40,398 --> 01:48:41,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, Rock Band!

1552
01:48:41,219 --> 01:48:43,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Nirvana has a bunch of songs coming out in Rock Band this week.

1553
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:46,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart-Shaped Box, Rape Me.

1554
01:48:46,362 --> 01:48:47,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a family-friendly song.

1555
01:48:47,883 --> 01:48:50,404
[SPEAKER_04]: All Apologies and You Know You're Right are all coming out.

1556
01:48:50,424 --> 01:48:53,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are actually some really big Nirvana songs, so that's pretty cool.

1557
01:48:53,806 --> 01:49:02,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a celebration of the 20th anniversary of Nirvana's Nevermind album, although it's weird because none of those tracks were actually on Nevermind, but...

1558
01:49:02,811 --> 01:49:09,677
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm not mistaken, never mind, that whole album was already released into rock bands some time ago, maybe for the 15th or something, I don't know.

1559
01:49:10,137 --> 01:49:18,644
[SPEAKER_04]: They are doing pro guitar and bass upgrades for plenty of Nirvana songs, including Smells Like Teen Spirit, The Live Lithium, and Come As You Are Live.

1560
01:49:18,945 --> 01:49:19,825
[SPEAKER_04]: All of those are getting upgrades.

1561
01:49:19,845 --> 01:49:22,928
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually like 10 songs getting upgrades, so...

1562
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:24,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can use all three chords?

1563
01:49:25,669 --> 01:49:29,769
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are a Nirvana fan, you're going to have a happy week in Rock Band this week.

1564
01:49:30,389 --> 01:49:33,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard DarkSakura give a little squee at this next story.

1565
01:49:34,490 --> 01:49:39,631
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are a fan of Capcom fighters, one of the missing ones is coming out on the PlayStation Store.

1566
01:49:40,091 --> 01:49:42,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Cyberbots Full Metal Madness.

1567
01:49:42,832 --> 01:49:43,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you know?

1568
01:49:43,532 --> 01:49:45,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game.

1569
01:49:47,133 --> 01:49:47,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1570
01:49:47,733 --> 01:49:49,913
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a quote from Puzzle Fighter.

1571
01:49:50,513 --> 01:49:50,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1572
01:49:50,854 --> 01:49:51,434
[SPEAKER_04]: From Devilot.

1573
01:49:51,454 --> 01:49:52,194
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1574
01:49:52,254 --> 01:49:52,554
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1575
01:49:52,574 --> 01:49:52,914
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1576
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:57,552
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, that is coming out on the PlayStation Store.

1577
01:49:57,992 --> 01:49:59,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that coming out in America too?

1578
01:49:59,773 --> 01:50:01,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just Japan?

1579
01:50:02,894 --> 01:50:04,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I imagine it will probably come out in both.

1580
01:50:04,975 --> 01:50:05,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Time to hook up to Saturn.

1581
01:50:05,956 --> 01:50:06,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's coming out in the U.S.

1582
01:50:06,976 --> 01:50:07,256
[SPEAKER_04]: as well.

1583
01:50:07,296 --> 01:50:10,057
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you like your Capcom fighters, that's going to be a pretty big deal.

1584
01:50:10,197 --> 01:50:11,978
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like they have a lot of Japanese change in it.

1585
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:17,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Tokyo Game Show produced from Square Enix this music sampler.

1586
01:50:18,021 --> 01:50:19,221
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the music sampler CD 2011 Volume 6.

1587
01:50:20,942 --> 01:50:21,703
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1588
01:50:43,526 --> 01:51:05,522
[SPEAKER_04]: However, there's some interesting arranged music that has tracks on the sampler CD Piano Collections, Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3 An El Shaddai remix album called El Shaddai and the Astrals That's kind of interesting Also, I guess something called Cafe SQ Which is supposed to be some type of musical tribute to Second Detsetsu The 20th anniversary of that as well

1589
01:51:05,842 --> 01:51:10,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So, pretty interesting there.

1590
01:51:10,605 --> 01:51:11,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's already being given out.

1591
01:51:11,766 --> 01:51:16,629
[SPEAKER_04]: The sampler is being given out at Tokyo Game Show, but the rest of those CDs probably throughout the next couple quarters.

1592
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:18,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, DarkSakura.

1593
01:51:20,491 --> 01:51:21,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I misquoted the line.

1594
01:51:22,493 --> 01:51:22,893
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what?

1595
01:51:22,933 --> 01:51:23,733
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't recognize me?

1596
01:51:24,114 --> 01:51:25,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Cyberboss is Capcom's number one game.

1597
01:51:26,895 --> 01:51:27,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1598
01:51:28,476 --> 01:51:29,317
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 points from Gryffindor.

1599
01:51:31,889 --> 01:51:32,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Portal is free!

1600
01:51:33,490 --> 01:51:37,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Very, very free on Steam until September 20th.

1601
01:51:37,093 --> 01:51:42,518
[SPEAKER_10]: But go get it now because it's Steam and Portal and it's free and very short and makes me throw up.

1602
01:51:43,699 --> 01:51:49,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up, Knights of the Old Republic is going down to £3.50 on Steam this weekend.

1603
01:51:49,984 --> 01:51:56,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it's a whole half price on all of the Star Wars games and the same goes for the US only in dollars and cents.

1604
01:51:57,871 --> 01:52:00,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to get your scrotour on, go for it.

1605
01:52:01,847 --> 01:52:03,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you just call it Skrotor?

1606
01:52:03,448 --> 01:52:03,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

1607
01:52:04,069 --> 01:52:04,929
[SPEAKER_04]: You're so mature.

1608
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:05,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, right?

1609
01:52:06,531 --> 01:52:10,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Batman Arkham City will actually have another character in it, Deadshot.

1610
01:52:12,815 --> 01:52:17,339
[SPEAKER_10]: And he will be in there to take out a series of high-value targets so Batman has to protect them.

1611
01:52:18,079 --> 01:52:28,687
[SPEAKER_10]: And also other characters in there are Rocksteady and Joker, Hugo Strange, Two-Face, Harley Quinn, Riddler, Poison Ivy, Mr. Free Penguin, and the Calendar Man.

1612
01:52:29,728 --> 01:52:30,068
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1613
01:52:31,294 --> 01:52:33,575
[SPEAKER_04]: That Arkham City game is going to be pretty sweet, I gotta say.

1614
01:52:33,595 --> 01:52:33,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1615
01:52:33,935 --> 01:52:35,755
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a lot of fun.

1616
01:52:35,815 --> 01:52:35,975
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1617
01:52:36,216 --> 01:52:36,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Scrotor.

1618
01:52:37,216 --> 01:52:37,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1619
01:52:38,416 --> 01:52:40,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, definitely get the free Portal.

1620
01:52:40,537 --> 01:52:41,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's free.

1621
01:52:41,617 --> 01:52:43,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just obviously a draw to get more people on Steam.

1622
01:52:43,618 --> 01:52:47,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody already got this like two years ago when it was free before... When it came out on Mac.

1623
01:52:48,079 --> 01:52:50,440
[SPEAKER_10]: When Steam for Mac came out, then Portal came out for free.

1624
01:52:50,560 --> 01:53:13,826
[SPEAKER_04]: But if for whatever reason you've been resistant to Steam or you didn't get it last time Or if somehow you're the one person that hasn't played Portal yet You really should just try it I'm not just saying that It is a pretty fucking rad game It's really awesome, it's super cool Even if you hate first person shooters, it's more of a puzzle game I don't like first person shooters and I play the hell out of Portal 2 And Portal 2 is so fucking good I know

1625
01:53:15,337 --> 01:53:18,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get back into some long-form news, I want to give a plug for this.

1626
01:53:18,979 --> 01:53:28,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't talk about this at the beginning of the show because I wanted the people that really stick with the show and who stick with it to really hear this because you're going to hear this on a lot of podcasts over the next few weeks.

1627
01:53:29,543 --> 01:53:32,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that time of year where the podcast awards are coming around, and I'm...

1628
01:53:33,644 --> 01:53:34,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always kind of on the fence about this.

1629
01:53:35,145 --> 01:53:37,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like that it's a gigantic popularity contest.

1630
01:53:37,966 --> 01:53:43,448
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot more fun the first year, and I'm not just saying that because we won, although obviously that helped.

1631
01:53:44,069 --> 01:53:46,410
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was more about independent shows then.

1632
01:53:46,650 --> 01:53:52,072
[SPEAKER_04]: It seriously seemed like all of the independent video game podcasts that existed at the time...

1633
01:53:52,392 --> 01:53:52,952
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

1634
01:54:15,069 --> 01:54:16,050
[SPEAKER_04]: and possibly win.

1635
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:20,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I would really just... I mean, we've won before, so it's cool as long as some independent podcast wins.

1636
01:54:20,996 --> 01:54:22,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's really important.

1637
01:54:22,237 --> 01:54:29,926
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want to see a bunch of corporate-funded, paid-for, commercialized podcasts get nominated.

1638
01:54:30,046 --> 01:54:30,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1639
01:54:31,147 --> 01:54:37,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to just kind of bite the bullet and ask, would you consider nominating Orange Lounge Radio for Best Gaming Podcast?

1640
01:54:37,491 --> 01:54:39,672
[SPEAKER_04]: It's www.podcastawards.com.

1641
01:54:40,132 --> 01:54:44,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe nominations are open until like the 30th, so not too much longer.

1642
01:54:44,295 --> 01:54:46,516
[SPEAKER_04]: This is probably the only time you're going to hear us mention on the show.

1643
01:54:46,996 --> 01:54:48,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, if you like the show, it's free.

1644
01:54:49,098 --> 01:54:50,659
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't shove commercials down your throat.

1645
01:54:50,999 --> 01:54:52,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Just help us get this exposure.

1646
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:53,660
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all we really ask.

1647
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:57,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Head over to podcastawards.com and please consider nominating us for Best Gaming Podcast.

1648
01:54:58,644 --> 01:55:02,387
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only nominate the show in one category.

1649
01:55:02,707 --> 01:55:04,709
[SPEAKER_04]: You maybe can do Best Produced as well.

1650
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:09,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even have delusions that we would get nominated in those categories.

1651
01:55:09,314 --> 01:55:09,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Best Produced.

1652
01:55:10,154 --> 01:55:11,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right?

1653
01:55:11,976 --> 01:55:16,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, somehow, many years ago, we got nominated for Best of Life 365 Best Station.

1654
01:55:17,261 --> 01:55:18,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know how we did it.

1655
01:55:18,262 --> 01:55:19,563
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because our fans are awesome.

1656
01:55:19,783 --> 01:55:21,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And because not a lot of Life 365 stations had...

1657
01:55:23,767 --> 01:55:24,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1658
01:55:40,911 --> 01:55:42,152
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1659
01:56:08,198 --> 01:56:17,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, he had the rock star type hair, you know, like the Bon Jovi style hair, you know, where they did have really long bushy 80s hair and then got it cut into that 90s cut.

1660
01:56:18,667 --> 01:56:19,168
[SPEAKER_10]: He had that.

1661
01:56:20,789 --> 01:56:21,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see.

1662
01:56:21,530 --> 01:56:25,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Brad from PodCulture is in the chat saying, I don't mess with the podcast awards.

1663
01:56:25,173 --> 01:56:26,214
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't stand a chance.

1664
01:56:26,274 --> 01:56:29,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then I'll say go nominate PodCulture for best sci-fi.

1665
01:56:29,677 --> 01:56:30,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there like a sci-fi category?

1666
01:56:30,798 --> 01:56:31,479
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be, right?

1667
01:56:31,739 --> 01:56:33,681
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be like a fandom or sci-fi category.

1668
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:34,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Go nominate PodCulture for that.

1669
01:56:35,422 --> 01:56:36,102
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time.

1670
01:57:05,129 --> 01:57:07,371
[SPEAKER_04]: PodcastWars.com, nominate us for best gaming podcast.

1671
01:57:07,791 --> 01:57:08,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Nominate us only once.

1672
01:57:09,072 --> 01:57:09,613
[SPEAKER_10]: It's uploading.

1673
01:57:10,533 --> 01:57:11,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the award that we won?

1674
01:57:11,374 --> 01:57:12,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, on Pun Man.

1675
01:57:13,095 --> 01:57:13,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1676
01:57:13,636 --> 01:57:29,328
[SPEAKER_04]: It would also be kind of neat, I gotta say, I'm not gonna lie, it would be kind of neat to have won that award in 2005, and then if we get nominated again, if, big if, I don't think any other show, certainly no other gaming shows, could claim that they've been nominated that many years apart.

1677
01:57:29,849 --> 01:57:29,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1678
01:57:30,009 --> 01:57:30,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1679
01:57:30,774 --> 01:57:53,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know maybe what other shows from back then are still going I think Video Game News Radio is probably the only one I think they're still going I think they're still live or they're not live on all games they do the tape thing on all games so maybe they they could get in there too which would be cool I'd be happy for them it's another indie show those guys work hard yeah so as long as an indie show wins at the end of the day I'm happy but if freaking

1680
01:57:55,322 --> 01:57:56,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Blank, blank, blank.

1681
01:57:56,204 --> 01:57:57,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Corporate website wins.

1682
01:57:57,285 --> 01:57:58,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to be happy.

1683
01:57:58,427 --> 01:58:00,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's at least push some indie to the top.

1684
01:58:01,072 --> 01:58:02,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I've said enough about that.

1685
01:58:05,859 --> 01:58:29,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was four player podcast which I think actually I see some of them on Twitter so they are an indie thing I think they're like a Justin TV related thing they do a lot with that stuff which we used to do the video broadcast but they've taken it all to the next level I think they were the ones that won last year so that is definitely an indie show as well and if they win it again good on them good for them

1686
01:58:30,342 --> 01:58:32,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on though with more gaming news.

1687
01:58:32,383 --> 01:58:33,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to talk about that anymore.

1688
01:58:33,504 --> 01:58:34,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I've given it far too much time.

1689
01:58:34,925 --> 01:58:35,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1690
01:58:36,406 --> 01:58:40,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so let's talk about GameStop.

1691
01:58:40,529 --> 01:58:43,091
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how they have their streaming service coming.

1692
01:58:43,931 --> 01:58:49,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we know that because of the whole debacle with Deus Ex and that kind of stuff.

1693
01:58:50,216 --> 01:58:52,297
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a little bit more to that as well.

1694
01:58:52,877 --> 01:58:59,522
[SPEAKER_03]: They've announced that they're going to be doing some sort of Android branded tablet thing.

1695
01:58:59,822 --> 01:59:08,127
[SPEAKER_03]: or I guess there'll be an Android tablet that's GameStop branded that's going to be paired to the dedicated controller peripheral that's going to be coming out later next year.

1696
01:59:09,168 --> 01:59:21,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thought is that the device will support, I guess, mobile apps and the goal is to allow full streaming of release titles to the tablet, kind of like on live or something like that.

1697
01:59:22,037 --> 01:59:25,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting and very unsettling creepy to me.

1698
01:59:25,501 --> 01:59:27,143
[SPEAKER_03]: But, eh, fine.

1699
01:59:27,183 --> 01:59:28,625
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to release a tablet, that's fine.

1700
01:59:28,665 --> 01:59:33,832
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more power to you, but at the same time, the tablet market is pretty crowded.

1701
01:59:33,952 --> 01:59:34,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So, meh.

1702
01:59:34,833 --> 01:59:35,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1703
01:59:36,696 --> 01:59:37,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll pass, thanks.

1704
01:59:38,197 --> 01:59:38,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1705
01:59:40,018 --> 01:59:41,459
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much what I have to say on that.

1706
01:59:42,259 --> 01:59:43,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Pass.

1707
01:59:45,081 --> 01:59:45,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1708
01:59:46,342 --> 01:59:51,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be difficult for them to do that, but if they want to try, fine.

1709
01:59:51,245 --> 01:59:53,486
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not supposed to say the name of the company.

1710
01:59:53,506 --> 01:59:53,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1711
01:59:53,746 --> 01:59:54,286
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how we feel.

1712
02:00:02,748 --> 02:00:05,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on to some other gaming news.

1713
02:00:06,151 --> 02:00:14,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this isn't really gaming per se, but it's certainly that gaming device that you use for gaming that's sitting in your living room that's soon going to be your entertainment device, if it's not already.

1714
02:00:14,817 --> 02:00:18,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft is launching a TV service for the Xbox 360 this holiday season.

1715
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:26,346
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of already knew that via E3, but it was confirmed by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer at a financial analyst meeting that happened this past week.

1716
02:00:26,887 --> 02:00:32,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft is working with, quote, dozens or hundreds of additional video content suppliers.

1717
02:00:32,671 --> 02:00:35,312
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a big difference between dozens and hundreds.

1718
02:00:35,332 --> 02:00:38,394
[SPEAKER_04]: There you know, working with one or a million.

1719
02:00:56,488 --> 02:00:57,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere in between there.

1720
02:00:57,248 --> 02:00:59,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's probably hard because they don't have a lot confirmed right now.

1721
02:00:59,610 --> 02:01:10,976
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wonder if this is like Xbox's kind of way to take a jab at Netflix while they're down, which is interesting because Netflix is a big – it's weird because Netflix is a big part of the 360 right now anyway.

1722
02:01:11,036 --> 02:01:16,719
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of – Netflix has really had a hard past couple months, and it's just going to get worse for them when they lose stars.

1723
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:17,640
[SPEAKER_04]: So –

1724
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:20,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, their stock is tumbling.

1725
02:01:20,823 --> 02:01:28,290
[SPEAKER_04]: If Microsoft pays out the anus to get all these agreements that Netflix is losing, it could be the thing to have.

1726
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:29,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1727
02:01:29,090 --> 02:01:29,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be interesting.

1728
02:01:31,232 --> 02:01:35,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if their service is really popular if they just drop Netflix.

1729
02:01:36,197 --> 02:01:36,658
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

1730
02:01:36,718 --> 02:01:38,479
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible.

1731
02:01:38,820 --> 02:01:42,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any interest in a Microsoft TV network?

1732
02:01:42,863 --> 02:01:42,924
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1733
02:01:43,704 --> 02:01:44,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd check it out.

1734
02:01:44,665 --> 02:01:48,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it's going to be included as part of my gold subscription, then sure.

1735
02:01:48,566 --> 02:01:49,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah, free TV.

1736
02:01:50,187 --> 02:01:51,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if they have on-demand stuff.

1737
02:01:52,027 --> 02:01:52,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's commercials.

1738
02:01:52,908 --> 02:01:54,688
[SPEAKER_03]: If I get it for free, I'm fine.

1739
02:01:54,769 --> 02:01:55,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I get limited cable now.

1740
02:01:56,009 --> 02:02:00,271
[SPEAKER_03]: FX, I don't get that anymore because they're paying for limited cable.

1741
02:02:00,631 --> 02:02:05,373
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, my box has an error right now, so I don't get any on-demand whatsoever.

1742
02:02:06,493 --> 02:02:08,574
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'd look forward to anything free.

1743
02:02:09,514 --> 02:02:10,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, cancel cable again.

1744
02:02:11,475 --> 02:02:27,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I would even just be happy if I could watch like shows that are on CBS just later when I want and not have to go on to CBS.com but like watch it in HD on my TV I would really like that like just being able to watch Survivor like the next day because Wednesday nights are raid nights so I can't watch Survivor live shut up don't judge me

1745
02:02:28,247 --> 02:02:55,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Cinderwolf is in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com a proud Canadian because he's saying and Canada gets shortchanged again as we have been with the internet TV feature included within Windows Media Center well hasn't this similar feature been out in like Europe and Britain specifically for some time like the Sky TV arrangement or is this like is this even beyond that like this is just a step further where Microsoft is now like trying to be the cable provider they're going a little further and

1746
02:02:55,655 --> 02:02:57,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I would prefer the latter because, you know...

1747
02:03:17,248 --> 02:03:19,851
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to watch on-demand stuff, I can just do it through my TV.

1748
02:03:20,731 --> 02:03:25,876
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're talking about my cable provider, I'd rather be Microsoft's own content.

1749
02:03:26,477 --> 02:03:27,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Some original shows would be nice.

1750
02:03:28,358 --> 02:03:31,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just 1 versus 100 coming back.

1751
02:03:32,382 --> 02:03:33,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm never going to let up on that.

1752
02:03:34,987 --> 02:03:41,473
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think Canada will probably get it eventually, but your way of thinking is probably right, because there's a follow-up comment here.

1753
02:03:41,553 --> 02:03:46,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Cinderwolf says, content will be extremely changed and limited compared to US TV available online.

1754
02:03:46,478 --> 02:03:47,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, he's probably right.

1755
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:53,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada will probably get it eventually, so will Mexico, so will wherever else Xbox does business.

1756
02:03:53,464 --> 02:03:55,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, you still have tech TV, so stop bitching.

1757
02:03:55,426 --> 02:03:55,466
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1758
02:04:01,101 --> 02:04:01,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I will swap you.

1759
02:04:02,021 --> 02:04:08,404
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have all the crappy content that we have here and I'll take Tech TV.

1760
02:04:08,664 --> 02:04:12,705
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it would be kind of cool if it would work the other way and we could get some Canadian shows here.

1761
02:04:12,725 --> 02:04:13,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.

1762
02:04:14,026 --> 02:04:18,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of the content laws up there, they get a lot of localized versions of shows too.

1763
02:04:19,428 --> 02:04:21,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they had So You Think You Can Dance Canada.

1764
02:04:21,989 --> 02:04:23,689
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Canadian Idol and all that stuff.

1765
02:04:23,709 --> 02:04:25,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they have a lot of these shows anymore.

1766
02:04:26,170 --> 02:04:27,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1767
02:04:27,311 --> 02:04:30,472
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be fun to watch tech TV and stuff.

1768
02:04:30,792 --> 02:04:33,074
[SPEAKER_03]: There's many countries that have their own version of The Office.

1769
02:04:33,254 --> 02:04:33,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1770
02:04:34,214 --> 02:04:35,755
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be fun.

1771
02:04:36,755 --> 02:04:37,055
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1772
02:04:37,216 --> 02:04:39,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1773
02:04:39,457 --> 02:04:40,617
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1774
02:04:41,057 --> 02:04:41,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, I lied.

1775
02:04:41,758 --> 02:04:42,738
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to go to the mailbag.

1776
02:04:42,938 --> 02:04:43,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

1777
02:04:43,579 --> 02:04:44,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on it tonight.

1778
02:04:45,079 --> 02:04:45,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, Rob.

1779
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:46,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag.

1780
02:04:46,300 --> 02:04:47,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Best produced show.

1781
02:04:47,361 --> 02:04:47,921
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1782
02:04:48,221 --> 02:04:50,042
[SPEAKER_04]: For your consideration, best produced.

1783
02:04:51,707 --> 02:04:55,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you guys send us email every week.

1784
02:04:55,771 --> 02:04:59,434
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura dives into the email bag and pulls out her favorites head first.

1785
02:04:59,514 --> 02:05:01,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless there's not a lot to pick from.

1786
02:05:01,516 --> 02:05:02,257
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one.

1787
02:05:03,077 --> 02:05:03,938
[SPEAKER_09]: One email.

1788
02:05:04,118 --> 02:05:04,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

1789
02:05:04,879 --> 02:05:07,762
[SPEAKER_04]: From Holly D. Most popular podcast, apparently.

1790
02:05:08,042 --> 02:05:09,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1791
02:05:09,283 --> 02:05:10,704
[SPEAKER_10]: This is to Loki.

1792
02:05:11,665 --> 02:05:13,327
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the same birthday as my puppy.

1793
02:05:13,447 --> 02:05:14,408
[SPEAKER_10]: She just turned one.

1794
02:05:14,428 --> 02:05:15,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Smile face.

1795
02:05:15,268 --> 02:05:15,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy birthday.

1796
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:17,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I will live longer than your puppy.

1797
02:05:18,913 --> 02:05:19,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

1798
02:05:20,494 --> 02:05:22,096
[SPEAKER_04]: What a rude thing to say!

1799
02:05:23,037 --> 02:05:25,480
[SPEAKER_04]: You apologize right now to that poor puppy.

1800
02:05:26,782 --> 02:05:32,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... Well, actually, no, that's not a fact because I eat like crap, so I'm sorry, puppy.

1801
02:05:32,348 --> 02:05:33,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations on your... There you go.

1802
02:05:34,210 --> 02:05:34,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Much better.

1803
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:35,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1804
02:06:02,952 --> 02:06:06,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnStrader.com if you want to be insulted by one of the hosts.

1805
02:06:07,137 --> 02:06:07,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Send us an email.

1806
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:10,341
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd really appreciate it.

1807
02:06:11,222 --> 02:06:14,986
[SPEAKER_04]: We always like to follow up the email bag with the FUs of the week.

1808
02:06:15,087 --> 02:06:16,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to get ranty.

1809
02:06:17,129 --> 02:06:17,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Rawr!

1810
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:35,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I just gotta read some comments from chat real quick, though, because it's so important.

1811
02:06:35,638 --> 02:06:36,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck the chat.

1812
02:06:36,338 --> 02:06:36,698
[SPEAKER_10]: No, kidding.

1813
02:06:36,939 --> 02:06:40,581
[SPEAKER_04]: SalaciousPop says, the puppy is better at not piddling on the rug, though.

1814
02:06:41,902 --> 02:06:45,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad says, from PodCulture, says, gonna burn in the special hell for that one.

1815
02:06:46,386 --> 02:06:48,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And Randy says, aw, poor Holly.

1816
02:06:48,207 --> 02:06:49,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Holly, you got fans in chat.

1817
02:06:49,448 --> 02:06:50,029
[SPEAKER_04]: They got your back.

1818
02:06:51,950 --> 02:06:52,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Rude, Loki.

1819
02:06:52,611 --> 02:06:53,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I love puppies.

1820
02:06:53,772 --> 02:06:55,373
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you do.

1821
02:06:55,433 --> 02:06:55,713
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1822
02:06:55,733 --> 02:06:56,634
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1823
02:06:57,577 --> 02:06:58,358
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a cat owner.

1824
02:06:58,958 --> 02:07:00,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a cat.

1825
02:07:00,940 --> 02:07:07,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a previous dog owner, since I'm a realist and I understand how much work it takes to have a cat versus having a dog.

1826
02:07:07,986 --> 02:07:11,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Dogs are awesome, but dogs actually need work to keep them clean and fed.

1827
02:07:11,789 --> 02:07:14,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Cats are awesome and they'll wake your baby.

1828
02:07:15,212 --> 02:07:15,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they will.

1829
02:07:16,213 --> 02:07:17,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Except Shermie, who doesn't give a shit.

1830
02:07:17,774 --> 02:07:18,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, FU's the lead.

1831
02:07:18,815 --> 02:07:19,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, tangent.

1832
02:07:19,856 --> 02:07:20,276
[SPEAKER_03]: FU's the lead.

1833
02:07:21,537 --> 02:07:28,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you to my headache that is now trying to come back and the increasing volume in this room.

1834
02:07:29,704 --> 02:07:31,766
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know how to use our inside voices on LLR.

1835
02:07:31,846 --> 02:07:32,667
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we don't!

1836
02:07:33,868 --> 02:07:34,969
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't my inside voice.

1837
02:07:37,231 --> 02:07:38,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you're off music of the week.

1838
02:07:38,592 --> 02:07:43,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to the woman driving a Ford GT car with the license plate.

1839
02:07:43,136 --> 02:07:44,618
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the best part right here.

1840
02:07:45,038 --> 02:07:48,241
[SPEAKER_03]: The license plate said, accelerate, love to.

1841
02:07:50,134 --> 02:07:50,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Great advice.

1842
02:07:50,695 --> 02:07:53,621
[SPEAKER_03]: You should take it yourself because you're driving 30 miles an hour in a 45.

1843
02:07:55,725 --> 02:07:56,467
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an old woman.

1844
02:07:57,383 --> 02:08:00,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that Accelerate Love Tube, but I'm an old bat, so I can't do that.

1845
02:08:01,025 --> 02:08:02,666
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, fuck you.

1846
02:08:03,046 --> 02:08:07,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, and by the way, the topper of all that, she turned into the bingo parking lot.

1847
02:08:07,688 --> 02:08:09,129
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, she was going to bingo.

1848
02:08:09,189 --> 02:08:09,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1849
02:08:10,150 --> 02:08:10,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1850
02:08:10,590 --> 02:08:12,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1851
02:08:12,451 --> 02:08:14,552
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to stuff.

1852
02:08:15,352 --> 02:08:17,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to talk about it.

1853
02:08:18,374 --> 02:08:19,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So, stuff.

1854
02:08:19,815 --> 02:08:21,796
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to vagueness.

1855
02:08:22,556 --> 02:08:23,617
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, vagueness.

1856
02:08:23,697 --> 02:08:24,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being vague.

1857
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:26,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how I feel about that, Rob.

1858
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:31,145
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, neither do I. So let's get back into the show, get some more news out.

1859
02:08:31,165 --> 02:08:33,908
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get the Twitter topics and the Skype line coming very soon.

1860
02:08:34,348 --> 02:08:35,029
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, Loki.

1861
02:08:35,730 --> 02:08:43,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we talked a little bit earlier in Part A about developers bitching and moaning about their games and how they're treated.

1862
02:08:44,437 --> 02:08:45,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor my 8.0.

1863
02:08:46,779 --> 02:08:47,259
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you get?

1864
02:08:47,319 --> 02:08:47,819
[SPEAKER_03]: A 9.

1865
02:08:48,079 --> 02:08:51,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a different person bitching now.

1866
02:08:51,581 --> 02:08:53,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Quadratic Dreams co-founder.

1867
02:08:54,142 --> 02:08:55,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to try to pronounce his name.

1868
02:08:55,263 --> 02:08:55,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Some French guy.

1869
02:08:56,163 --> 02:09:06,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, he estimates that the studio lost between 5 and 10 million euro due to second-hand sales.

1870
02:09:06,909 --> 02:09:10,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, we sold today approximately 2 million units.

1871
02:09:10,450 --> 02:09:12,852
[SPEAKER_03]: We know from the trophy system that probably 3...

1872
02:09:13,792 --> 02:09:17,255
[SPEAKER_03]: More than 3 million people bought the game and played it.

1873
02:09:18,877 --> 02:09:22,660
[SPEAKER_03]: On a small level, it's a million people playing the game without giving me one cent.

1874
02:09:23,781 --> 02:09:25,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Too fucking bad is what I say to that.

1875
02:09:25,783 --> 02:09:33,970
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the rentals or friends loaning their copies to other friends or multiple PSN accounts on the same PlayStation?

1876
02:09:35,231 --> 02:09:36,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Too fucking bad is what I say.

1877
02:09:36,832 --> 02:09:37,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1878
02:09:37,533 --> 02:09:38,033
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1879
02:09:38,234 --> 02:09:38,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That's...

1880
02:09:40,135 --> 02:09:43,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Make an awesome game that people want to buy day one, you know what I mean?

1881
02:10:04,767 --> 02:10:07,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavy Rain is a pretty good game.

1882
02:10:07,470 --> 02:10:14,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavy Rain is alright, but it's... How much replayability is there really with Heavy Rain?

1883
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:16,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a pretty linear game.

1884
02:10:16,922 --> 02:10:18,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you're done with it, you

1885
02:10:19,373 --> 02:10:20,313
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like watching a movie.

1886
02:10:20,714 --> 02:10:26,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you've seen it so many times, unless you're a super fan of the movie, you could probably get rid of it and be fine.

1887
02:10:26,959 --> 02:10:31,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And his other comment is, now, are games too expensive?

1888
02:10:31,663 --> 02:10:36,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always said that games are probably too expensive, so there's probably a right level here to find.

1889
02:10:36,568 --> 02:10:39,530
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to discuss this all together and try to find a way that...

1890
02:10:40,711 --> 02:10:50,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say reconcile consumer expectations, retail expectations, but also the expectations of the publishers and developers who make this business a worthwhile business.

1891
02:10:53,182 --> 02:10:57,185
[SPEAKER_03]: But once again, though, I don't feel bad for you that your game sold used.

1892
02:10:57,665 --> 02:10:58,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Too fucking bad.

1893
02:10:58,886 --> 02:11:03,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are all the other publishers bitching about secondhand sales from their games?

1894
02:11:04,090 --> 02:11:04,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Suck it up.

1895
02:11:04,531 --> 02:11:05,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know what?

1896
02:11:05,291 --> 02:11:06,893
[SPEAKER_03]: You sold a couple million copies.

1897
02:11:08,499 --> 02:11:10,401
[SPEAKER_03]: That's better than most games do.

1898
02:11:34,162 --> 02:11:38,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there's a game that I may be more interested in purchasing new, and it's by this development house.

1899
02:11:38,847 --> 02:11:39,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe I'm going to go buy it.

1900
02:11:40,709 --> 02:11:55,683
[SPEAKER_03]: But just this type of mind frame and stuff, to me it seems like the next step is, oh, I'm going to try to find a way to prevent the second-hand sales, and then that's where we get into the whole other problems.

1901
02:11:55,823 --> 02:11:57,545
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not going to go away.

1902
02:11:59,597 --> 02:12:02,898
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, let's move on to a story about a game that maybe some folks would have bought new.

1903
02:12:02,938 --> 02:12:04,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people bought it new over here.

1904
02:12:04,619 --> 02:12:07,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Or put out more DLC because then those people who bought it used it.

1905
02:12:07,660 --> 02:12:08,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to ruin my transition.

1906
02:12:08,841 --> 02:12:09,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Can buy the DLC.

1907
02:12:10,001 --> 02:12:11,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there is DLC for Heavy Rain, isn't there?

1908
02:12:11,522 --> 02:12:11,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, put more.

1909
02:12:12,162 --> 02:12:12,382
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1910
02:12:12,762 --> 02:12:15,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's talk about Rock Band in Japan.

1911
02:12:16,304 --> 02:12:23,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know this, that Harmonix was teaming up with Q Entertainment back in 2008 to actually put Rock Band out in Japan, but it didn't happen.

1912
02:12:24,367 --> 02:12:25,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Q Entertainment actually walked away from it.

1913
02:12:26,268 --> 02:12:30,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, apparently, Harmonix didn't end up ever putting the game out in Japan.

1914
02:12:31,710 --> 02:12:41,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's been questions that have come up at Tokyo Game Show this week and so forth, because they did put out Dance Central, which is also coming out in Japan, Dance Central 2.

1915
02:12:42,353 --> 02:13:06,662
[SPEAKER_04]: and in an interview this week they were saying that they were very much interested in bringing the experience to the Japanese market but there were just some challenges a lot of it had to do with the fact that you know trying to get all those plastic peripherals to an island country I guess proved difficult just the fact that people have smaller homes and all that stuff of course I kind of go well what about like Guitar Hero and excuse me Guitar Freaks and Drum Freaks and all that um

1916
02:13:08,391 --> 02:13:27,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Harmonix I guess at one point was looking at arcades as a way to do it but they said that arcades are very very noisy and if you're trying to make something that's really a musical experience and you've got 37 other arcade machines all turned up to full volume it kind of impairs the musicality of the experience um

1917
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:29,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1918
02:13:50,393 --> 02:13:50,913
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1919
02:13:52,154 --> 02:13:55,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zaku in chat says, bullshit, Konami was trying to sue their ass.

1920
02:13:55,155 --> 02:13:55,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why.

1921
02:13:56,536 --> 02:13:57,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember that.

1922
02:13:57,476 --> 02:13:59,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't the lawsuit, the lawsuit was never about Harmonix.

1923
02:13:59,457 --> 02:14:00,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't it about Activision?

1924
02:14:00,657 --> 02:14:01,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was Activision.

1925
02:14:01,278 --> 02:14:02,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was Activision.

1926
02:14:02,298 --> 02:14:03,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1927
02:14:05,239 --> 02:14:06,760
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all been so long ago now.

1928
02:14:06,780 --> 02:14:08,781
[SPEAKER_04]: 2008, that was like three years ago.

1929
02:14:09,941 --> 02:14:10,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Good lord.

1930
02:14:11,862 --> 02:14:12,142
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1931
02:14:12,822 --> 02:14:13,843
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1932
02:14:15,009 --> 02:14:15,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Just something about Oblivion.

1933
02:14:16,930 --> 02:14:23,375
[SPEAKER_10]: The European Oblivion 5th Anniversary Edition release date, in fact, if anyone's interested.

1934
02:14:24,175 --> 02:14:27,878
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be on September 23rd, and it will be £20 on PS3 and Xbox 360 and £18 on PC.

1935
02:14:32,421 --> 02:14:45,176
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be the Game of the Year edition of Oblivion which has the download content, add-ons, Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine and in the box are the Making of Oblivion DVD and a color map of the world and the Shivering Isles.

1936
02:14:47,193 --> 02:14:55,080
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had the regular Oblivion, then we had Oblivion Game of the Year Edition, now we're having Oblivion 5 years of Oblivion Edition.

1937
02:14:55,140 --> 02:14:56,841
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also a Skyrim video thrown in.

1938
02:14:57,482 --> 02:14:57,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1939
02:14:58,463 --> 02:15:02,346
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not going to have the Steelbook casing in Europe, but it will in the US.

1940
02:15:03,888 --> 02:15:07,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if it's that same walkthrough video that hit YouTube this past week for Skyrim.

1941
02:15:07,951 --> 02:15:08,772
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a pretty good video.

1942
02:15:08,872 --> 02:15:10,994
[SPEAKER_10]: No idea, but people like Oblivion.

1943
02:15:11,465 --> 02:15:13,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that was in a steelbook case in the U.S.

1944
02:15:14,446 --> 02:15:16,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was just re-released with $10.

1945
02:15:17,807 --> 02:15:20,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Is the anniversary edition coming out in the steelbook case?

1946
02:15:21,668 --> 02:15:22,328
[SPEAKER_03]: In the U.S.?

1947
02:15:22,648 --> 02:15:23,088
[SPEAKER_10]: In the U.S.

1948
02:15:23,368 --> 02:15:24,608
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's already come out in the U.S.

1949
02:15:25,269 --> 02:15:26,169
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out back in July.

1950
02:15:27,009 --> 02:15:27,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the end of June.

1951
02:15:27,949 --> 02:15:29,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this is a new new one.

1952
02:15:29,950 --> 02:15:30,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Fifth anniversary edition?

1953
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:32,390
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the fifth anniversary edition.

1954
02:15:32,490 --> 02:15:34,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it said it had the steelbook case in the U.S.,

1955
02:15:35,075 --> 02:15:36,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1956
02:15:36,297 --> 02:15:36,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it did.

1957
02:15:37,318 --> 02:15:38,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought the game like five years ago.

1958
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:41,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to buy it again just because they threw in some extra shit that I already got.

1959
02:15:41,883 --> 02:15:44,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you get ten bucks off Skyrim if you buy the game too.

1960
02:15:47,424 --> 02:15:49,025
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't played it, you know, it's good.

1961
02:16:17,276 --> 02:16:18,938
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, you can punch sheep in the face.

1962
02:16:18,998 --> 02:16:19,638
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'll say.

1963
02:16:20,559 --> 02:16:21,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Or let Loki say for me.

1964
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:24,362
[SPEAKER_03]: You can join guilds and rob them blind.

1965
02:16:25,123 --> 02:16:26,584
[SPEAKER_03]: All the fun stuff you can do in Oblivion.

1966
02:16:28,446 --> 02:16:30,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks in chat are like, wow, Oblivion's that old?

1967
02:16:30,688 --> 02:16:32,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the same reaction I had.

1968
02:16:32,109 --> 02:16:33,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, shit, I remember when that came out.

1969
02:16:34,351 --> 02:16:36,773
[SPEAKER_04]: It was delayed from the original Xbox launch.

1970
02:16:36,793 --> 02:16:38,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to be a launch title.

1971
02:16:38,114 --> 02:16:38,634
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't make it.

1972
02:16:39,475 --> 02:16:40,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Loki.

1973
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:43,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto is a lot...

1974
02:16:44,399 --> 02:16:45,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big surprise.

1975
02:16:45,900 --> 02:16:46,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Big game series.

1976
02:16:47,541 --> 02:16:57,905
[SPEAKER_03]: The fourth expansion, Grand Theft Auto 4, surpassed 22 million units shipped, which brings the total for the entire franchise to 114 million units shipped since 1997.

1977
02:16:58,525 --> 02:17:01,507
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty amazing.

1978
02:17:02,207 --> 02:17:04,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently surpassed San Andreas.

1979
02:17:05,328 --> 02:17:10,171
[SPEAKER_03]: San Andreas sold 21.5 million units, and this, of course, 500,000 over that.

1980
02:17:13,698 --> 02:17:14,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto V

1981
02:17:35,515 --> 02:17:40,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically, you know, obviously it kind of came up with the whole sandbox gameplay.

1982
02:17:40,717 --> 02:17:44,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, people buy the gameplay because you can do whatever you want.

1983
02:17:44,359 --> 02:18:01,826
[SPEAKER_03]: You can drive around, be a criminal, and do all sorts of crazy stuff with cars, shooting people, and then just, you know, recently with the PSP and then the, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 and the episodes from Liberty City and stuff, you know, the multiplayer has been pretty cool.

1984
02:18:02,786 --> 02:18:02,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1985
02:18:04,227 --> 02:18:05,228
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1986
02:18:27,586 --> 02:18:38,520
[SPEAKER_03]: San Andreas especially that was a great game and then of course the new one 5 is supposed to be kind of like at least taking place in San Andreas again so that'll be freaking awesome

1987
02:18:39,614 --> 02:18:58,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well I got one more news story for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio but this is a very important story because I've been waiting like a year and a half, maybe two years to report on this story and it's not that I'm like particularly the biggest fan of this game but...

1988
02:18:59,758 --> 02:19:00,959
[SPEAKER_04]: This just takes me back.

1989
02:19:01,239 --> 02:19:11,623
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks to the Australian Classification Board listing, apparently an HD remake has been spotted of a certain racing game.

1990
02:19:12,404 --> 02:19:13,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what racing game?

1991
02:19:15,925 --> 02:19:16,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Derby Owners Club.

1992
02:19:17,226 --> 02:19:17,566
That's right!

1993
02:19:17,586 --> 02:19:18,767
Daytona, USA!

1994
02:19:18,807 --> 02:19:19,247
Daytona!

1995
02:19:31,994 --> 02:19:36,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it doesn't have this song in it, fail.

1996
02:19:36,495 --> 02:19:36,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolute fail.

1997
02:19:36,915 --> 02:19:37,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not purchase.

1998
02:19:37,715 --> 02:19:38,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not purchase.

1999
02:19:38,595 --> 02:19:40,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Demand that this song be included.

2000
02:19:41,276 --> 02:19:45,056
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that the lyrics are taken out for the Sega Racing Classic.

2001
02:19:45,316 --> 02:19:46,317
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

2002
02:19:46,617 --> 02:19:51,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still the music, but... Do you at least get the do-do-do-do-do-do part?

2003
02:19:52,058 --> 02:19:52,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2004
02:19:52,338 --> 02:19:57,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the most important part right there.

2005
02:19:57,859 --> 02:19:58,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

2006
02:20:02,517 --> 02:20:10,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, so we don't know when the release date is, but clearly it looks like something that's probably going to come out for Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network, something downloadable.

2007
02:20:10,502 --> 02:20:13,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there already was like a Sega racing game earlier this year, right?

2008
02:20:13,744 --> 02:20:23,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I know that there are no announcements, and as far as I'm aware, no plans whatsoever to bring this game to consoles or portable systems.

2009
02:20:23,270 --> 02:20:27,712
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do a Carmen Sandiego game, it's got to have the theme song from the game show.

2010
02:20:28,193 --> 02:20:28,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

2011
02:20:33,311 --> 02:20:35,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, one more time before I open up the skyline.

2012
02:20:35,512 --> 02:20:41,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Just please, one more bit of Daytona, at least until a couple weeks when it gets confirmed to have a release date.

2013
02:20:41,993 --> 02:20:43,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I can play the song again.

2014
02:20:44,154 --> 02:20:44,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2015
02:20:45,054 --> 02:20:46,394
Come on, put up the horns.

2016
02:21:04,278 --> 02:21:08,761
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2017
02:21:09,202 --> 02:21:13,925
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I may make people sing the Daytona theme song tonight.

2018
02:21:15,486 --> 02:21:20,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I may need our listeners to call in and give us at least a do-do-do-do-do-do a little bit.

2019
02:21:20,690 --> 02:21:21,210
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know.

2020
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:21,550
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

2021
02:21:21,951 --> 02:21:22,571
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends who you are.

2022
02:21:23,031 --> 02:21:25,553
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're someone that calls the show every week, I'm going to make you sing.

2023
02:21:25,573 --> 02:21:30,016
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2024
02:21:30,497 --> 02:21:32,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a call and we will...

2025
02:21:34,238 --> 02:21:35,098
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2026
02:22:01,391 --> 02:22:01,932
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2027
02:22:25,018 --> 02:22:26,258
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you'll love this one.

2028
02:22:27,439 --> 02:22:33,160
[SPEAKER_04]: A mother of five met her online lover who was 16 in New York.

2029
02:22:33,820 --> 02:22:36,361
[SPEAKER_04]: They met on the game World of Warcraft.

2030
02:22:36,441 --> 02:22:42,702
[SPEAKER_04]: She was a 35-year-old mother of five, and she allegedly lured a minor for sex after meeting him in an online video game.

2031
02:22:42,982 --> 02:22:45,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my favorite passage of the whole story, though.

2032
02:22:45,403 --> 02:22:46,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this part.

2033
02:22:46,903 --> 02:22:58,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenkins, who's the suspect, Angie Jenkins, allegedly made contact with the 15-year-old boy with the World of Warcraft video game, where players can talk with each other, according to the U.S.

2034
02:22:58,806 --> 02:22:59,266
[SPEAKER_04]: attorney.

2035
02:23:00,767 --> 02:23:01,727
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't say.

2036
02:23:01,947 --> 02:23:03,267
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an MMO.

2037
02:23:03,507 --> 02:23:06,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an online game where you're shitting me.

2038
02:23:06,448 --> 02:23:07,868
[SPEAKER_04]: They talk to each other now?

2039
02:23:08,508 --> 02:23:10,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, in inter...

2040
02:23:10,882 --> 02:23:13,063
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's be real, no one uses voice chat on WoW.

2041
02:23:13,724 --> 02:23:16,485
[SPEAKER_04]: They built that whole feature in and ain't no one using it.

2042
02:23:16,505 --> 02:23:16,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Ventrilo.

2043
02:23:16,946 --> 02:23:19,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's on Ventrilo.

2044
02:23:20,568 --> 02:23:21,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this too.

2045
02:23:21,648 --> 02:23:24,810
[SPEAKER_04]: The boy's parents took away his cell phone.

2046
02:23:25,271 --> 02:23:25,891
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happened?

2047
02:23:25,911 --> 02:23:28,993
[SPEAKER_04]: She bought him a new one and then drove to New York to have sex with him in a parking lot.

2048
02:23:29,493 --> 02:23:30,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Classy!

2049
02:23:31,803 --> 02:23:32,724
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2050
02:23:53,465 --> 02:23:57,769
[SPEAKER_04]: footage of the cancelled Avengers game apparently made its way to the internet.

2051
02:23:57,989 --> 02:23:59,810
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is in a tweet that Tigerclaw sent us.

2052
02:24:00,391 --> 02:24:01,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not seen this at all.

2053
02:24:02,132 --> 02:24:02,733
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

2054
02:24:02,773 --> 02:24:04,394
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn these fucking sponsor messages.

2055
02:24:04,434 --> 02:24:04,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

2056
02:24:04,715 --> 02:24:08,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta get through these messages.

2057
02:24:08,518 --> 02:24:09,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's come back to this after we take a call.

2058
02:24:10,019 --> 02:24:11,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna feel the force.

2059
02:24:12,081 --> 02:24:13,142
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not wanna feel the force.

2060
02:24:13,162 --> 02:24:14,122
[SPEAKER_04]: You wanna feel this phone call.

2061
02:24:14,162 --> 02:24:15,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2062
02:24:15,043 --> 02:24:15,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2063
02:24:15,323 --> 02:24:15,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2064
02:24:16,524 --> 02:24:16,904
[SPEAKER_04]: C.D.

2065
02:24:16,965 --> 02:24:17,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Thunder

2066
02:24:40,455 --> 02:24:42,056
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to say about Dead Island?

2067
02:25:05,653 --> 02:25:14,666
[SPEAKER_13]: and then it's almost like an RPG because you can upgrade things but it's pretty interesting.

2068
02:25:15,587 --> 02:25:21,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So like you might have a gun in Dead Island and heaven forbid you actually run out of bullets and you can't use that gun anymore?

2069
02:25:21,815 --> 02:25:23,877
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean when you say artsy?

2070
02:25:41,732 --> 02:25:47,255
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how, like, that trailer that they put out had that sad little song and it was all in slow motion.

2071
02:25:47,275 --> 02:25:49,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very artsy, like, the way they did it.

2072
02:25:49,596 --> 02:25:53,078
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, the game at the end of the day is a zombie first-person shooter, right?

2073
02:25:53,258 --> 02:25:56,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it, like, did they try to class it up a bit?

2074
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:57,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to explain it.

2075
02:25:58,021 --> 02:26:01,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I didn't see the trailer, but it's very colorful.

2076
02:26:01,943 --> 02:26:06,986
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's set like a jungle setting where you have all these different apartment and condo things.

2077
02:26:08,187 --> 02:26:08,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Mm-hmm.

2078
02:26:09,468 --> 02:26:11,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how does it compare to other zombie games?

2079
02:26:11,469 --> 02:26:13,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it as good or does it suck or what?

2080
02:26:14,190 --> 02:26:27,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I haven't actually played it, but it looks really good, but I think I might want to play it if I could.

2081
02:26:29,098 --> 02:26:30,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I just assumed that he'd played it.

2082
02:26:30,399 --> 02:26:31,259
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right, that's all right.

2083
02:26:31,279 --> 02:26:33,520
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, what do you want to say about Driver San Francisco?

2084
02:26:34,101 --> 02:26:36,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you played Driver San Francisco or is this just like you want to?

2085
02:26:38,411 --> 02:26:40,192
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like another want to thing.

2086
02:26:40,272 --> 02:26:40,892
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2087
02:26:40,972 --> 02:26:42,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you want to play Driver San Francisco?

2088
02:26:42,993 --> 02:26:52,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually heard a lot of good things about Driver San Francisco, especially the multiplayer, which is interesting because the last Driver game I remember playing was Driver 3, which was lol.

2089
02:26:53,218 --> 02:26:55,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Lol.

2090
02:26:55,259 --> 02:26:55,820
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is fun.

2091
02:26:55,860 --> 02:26:56,060
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2092
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:57,460
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to say about Driver San Francisco?

2093
02:27:00,395 --> 02:27:09,699
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things I really like about it is there's parts where your body is floating above the city and you go into other vehicles and you take over another person's body pretty much.

2094
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:15,542
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you talk, it's actually the person talking, but you're making them say whatever you want.

2095
02:27:16,972 --> 02:27:18,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that the whole thing about Driver?

2096
02:27:18,714 --> 02:27:20,195
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to possess people?

2097
02:27:20,275 --> 02:27:24,479
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of float from car to car and you could possess a cop car and all that stuff?

2098
02:27:24,599 --> 02:27:25,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Off a cliff!

2099
02:27:25,119 --> 02:27:25,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Off a cliff!

2100
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:26,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Off a cliff!

2101
02:27:26,540 --> 02:27:28,402
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how you want to play, right?

2102
02:27:28,502 --> 02:27:33,867
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a mission where you have to take possession of this guy and scare his driving instructor.

2103
02:27:36,843 --> 02:27:41,944
[SPEAKER_13]: So he had to make his heartbeat go up to this number of beats per second.

2104
02:27:42,245 --> 02:27:50,727
[SPEAKER_13]: And he says stuff like, oh, if you stop doing this now, take 20% off your next driving lessons, which there will be a lot of.

2105
02:27:51,847 --> 02:27:55,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin68 in our chat says, Driver San Francisco is actually good.

2106
02:27:55,508 --> 02:27:56,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then why did they call it Driver?

2107
02:27:58,029 --> 02:27:58,469
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just kidding.

2108
02:27:58,489 --> 02:28:04,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, because you're a guy who's a cop who drives around doing these different things, different missions.

2109
02:28:04,651 --> 02:28:04,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

2110
02:28:06,249 --> 02:28:08,051
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I think that's why it's called Driver.

2111
02:28:08,231 --> 02:28:10,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, because it's that same concept that's been around since the beginning.

2112
02:28:10,733 --> 02:28:13,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can't get out of the car you're driving.

2113
02:28:13,275 --> 02:28:15,136
[SPEAKER_04]: You're stuck in the car forever.

2114
02:28:16,357 --> 02:28:21,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Until you drive it off cliff and then... Well, CD Thunder, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2115
02:28:21,521 --> 02:28:22,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other games you're looking forward to?

2116
02:28:24,164 --> 02:28:24,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

2117
02:28:26,161 --> 02:28:28,984
[SPEAKER_13]: There's one I'm really looking forward to, that Rise of Nightmares.

2118
02:28:30,045 --> 02:28:31,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Mm-hmm.

2119
02:28:31,447 --> 02:28:32,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Why Rise of Nightmares?

2120
02:28:33,129 --> 02:28:36,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I like creepy games like House of the Dead and all that type of thing.

2121
02:28:38,935 --> 02:28:42,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking you're kind of a zombie fan.

2122
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:44,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, a little bit.

2123
02:28:44,521 --> 02:28:45,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Not completely.

2124
02:28:46,543 --> 02:28:46,984
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2125
02:28:47,004 --> 02:28:47,064
[SPEAKER_13]: And...

2126
02:28:50,097 --> 02:28:54,062
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've only seen parts of it, but it's not actually that scary.

2127
02:28:54,082 --> 02:28:57,687
[SPEAKER_13]: It might scare other people, but it's got very creepy atmospheres.

2128
02:28:58,508 --> 02:28:59,549
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also incredibly gory.

2129
02:29:00,090 --> 02:29:07,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, before we let you go, CD Thunder, I've got to let you go so we can get more calls, but we have folks in chat requesting, could we get a few bars of the Daytona theme song?

2130
02:29:08,066 --> 02:29:15,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Day, Daytona, let's go racing, Daytona.

2131
02:29:15,650 --> 02:29:16,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful, beautiful.

2132
02:29:16,590 --> 02:29:17,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

2133
02:29:17,811 --> 02:29:19,212
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a little bit of vibrato in his voice.

2134
02:29:19,252 --> 02:29:19,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked that.

2135
02:29:20,512 --> 02:29:20,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2136
02:29:20,933 --> 02:29:22,153
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, have a good one, buddy.

2137
02:29:22,733 --> 02:29:23,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2138
02:29:23,894 --> 02:29:25,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly I'm Simon Cowell.

2139
02:29:25,155 --> 02:29:27,336
[SPEAKER_03]: You reminded me of something.

2140
02:29:27,896 --> 02:29:28,216
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

2141
02:29:28,456 --> 02:29:33,139
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some previews, people talking about Silent Hill Downpour and how terrible it is.

2142
02:29:33,679 --> 02:29:34,559
[SPEAKER_03]: It got delayed to next year.

2143
02:29:35,980 --> 02:29:37,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2144
02:29:37,723 --> 02:29:39,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Won't make it for Halloween, huh?

2145
02:29:39,185 --> 02:29:39,806
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's terrible.

2146
02:29:40,647 --> 02:29:42,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that's what they got to do to make it really good.

2147
02:29:42,850 --> 02:29:43,371
[SPEAKER_03]: They got to polish it up.

2148
02:29:43,391 --> 02:29:44,092
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's going next year.

2149
02:29:44,112 --> 02:29:44,552
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2150
02:29:44,753 --> 02:29:45,894
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably a good thing then.

2151
02:29:46,415 --> 02:29:47,877
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what I've heard.

2152
02:29:47,897 --> 02:29:52,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen the official move yet, but yeah, it's next year.

2153
02:29:53,635 --> 02:29:56,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let me get to this Avengers preview.

2154
02:29:56,457 --> 02:29:58,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been making DarkSakura wait here for so long.

2155
02:29:58,798 --> 02:30:00,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a look at this here.

2156
02:30:02,100 --> 02:30:05,041
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some of the Avengers game that was cancelled.

2157
02:30:05,261 --> 02:30:09,323
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this game looks cool to you, like this whole flying around as Iron Man, guess what?

2158
02:30:09,343 --> 02:30:10,224
[SPEAKER_04]: You're never going to play it.

2159
02:30:11,224 --> 02:30:15,987
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give us a call, by the way, 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2160
02:30:16,047 --> 02:30:16,907
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all first person.

2161
02:30:17,748 --> 02:30:19,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it'd probably make me throw up, but it looks pretty cool.

2162
02:30:20,731 --> 02:30:21,952
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be fun to watch someone else play for a while.

2163
02:30:21,972 --> 02:30:27,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, Sega's probably going to have a license for the Avengers game and it'll be a crappy brawler beat-em-up like the other games have been.

2164
02:30:27,655 --> 02:30:31,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I would really like for them to do an Avengers game like they did Ultimate Alliance.

2165
02:30:32,458 --> 02:30:34,979
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be really fun because I love Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

2166
02:30:35,159 --> 02:30:39,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I do kind of like the way that they've done this where it's like you really become the superhero.

2167
02:30:39,722 --> 02:30:41,223
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of neat.

2168
02:30:41,243 --> 02:30:42,623
[SPEAKER_04]: And you fight Super Skrulls.

2169
02:30:43,544 --> 02:30:46,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see if there's any other clips other than just the Iron Man.

2170
02:30:47,266 --> 02:30:48,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's Hulk.

2171
02:30:48,086 --> 02:30:48,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's clear that's Hulk.

2172
02:30:50,043 --> 02:30:50,543
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of neat.

2173
02:30:51,263 --> 02:30:53,184
[SPEAKER_10]: With Captain America, you see the shield on one arm.

2174
02:30:53,824 --> 02:30:54,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

2175
02:30:54,504 --> 02:30:55,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for sharing that with us, TigerClaw.

2176
02:30:55,905 --> 02:31:00,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to one more tweet from TigerClaw at twitter.com slash OLR.

2177
02:31:00,566 --> 02:31:02,567
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is sadly the last tweet we got tonight.

2178
02:31:03,487 --> 02:31:06,168
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is about a... Oh, you guys will love this.

2179
02:31:06,548 --> 02:31:07,849
[SPEAKER_04]: An Unreal Tournament 3 mod.

2180
02:31:10,229 --> 02:31:11,270
[SPEAKER_04]: What they've modded on this?

2181
02:31:11,831 --> 02:31:12,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Nyan Cat.

2182
02:31:13,592 --> 02:31:16,235
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, they've modded Nyan Cat in Unreal Tournament.

2183
02:31:16,515 --> 02:31:19,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, because we're getting another call, but we'll come back to Nyan Cat in a little bit.

2184
02:31:19,517 --> 02:31:20,318
[SPEAKER_04]: First, we got another call.

2185
02:31:20,358 --> 02:31:21,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2186
02:31:21,259 --> 02:31:21,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2187
02:31:23,081 --> 02:31:24,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It's me.

2188
02:31:24,061 --> 02:31:25,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, me.

2189
02:31:25,323 --> 02:31:27,745
[SPEAKER_04]: What would the listeners rather know you as?

2190
02:31:28,445 --> 02:31:29,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, whatever.

2191
02:31:29,226 --> 02:31:30,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatov, Shane.

2192
02:31:30,887 --> 02:31:32,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Miklatov, Shane, whatever.

2193
02:31:33,109 --> 02:31:34,330
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Shane Latov?

2194
02:31:34,691 --> 02:31:35,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane Latov.

2195
02:31:35,351 --> 02:31:37,073
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you call in to talk about tonight, Shane Latov?

2196
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:48,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I called in to talk about how awesome NeoWiz is and they released Tapsonic this week on the iPhone or iOS and it's really, really fun.

2197
02:31:48,528 --> 02:31:49,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I forgot to talk about that game.

2198
02:31:49,989 --> 02:31:51,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I downloaded that on iPhone.

2199
02:31:52,031 --> 02:31:52,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's neat.

2200
02:31:53,091 --> 02:31:54,613
[SPEAKER_04]: NeoWiz, what else do they make?

2201
02:31:54,953 --> 02:31:55,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you said they're awesome.

2202
02:31:55,934 --> 02:31:56,534
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Max.

2203
02:31:57,235 --> 02:31:58,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't realize it's the same company.

2204
02:31:58,636 --> 02:32:00,318
[SPEAKER_02]: They're partially responsible for that.

2205
02:32:00,338 --> 02:32:04,561
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you see a lot of DJ Max songs when you're actually playing Tapsonic.

2206
02:32:05,182 --> 02:32:06,663
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the free songs is

2207
02:32:10,136 --> 02:32:12,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought it was because they were both Korean games.

2208
02:32:12,759 --> 02:32:13,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2209
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:14,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

2210
02:32:29,544 --> 02:32:32,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell the listeners about this game a little bit for those that have no idea what TapSonic is.

2211
02:32:34,465 --> 02:32:37,426
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is free to check out, sort of.

2212
02:32:37,446 --> 02:32:39,487
[SPEAKER_04]: There's microtransactions at the butt in the game, right?

2213
02:32:41,768 --> 02:32:46,069
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to play for real, you have to use those microtransactions.

2214
02:32:46,949 --> 02:32:55,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, as I was unaware, when you spend... If you were one of the first 1,000 people that downloaded it, you got 300 million points.

2215
02:32:57,376 --> 02:33:23,559
[SPEAKER_02]: and use those music points to purchase songs or so I thought you actually use those music points to play songs and you do not get to keep those songs once you spend the money on them so every time you play a song you're spending points so it's awesome I go back later I can just get a preview because I'm out of points wow that's kind of shitty though I gotta say I don't like that but I noticed the free songs rotate what's that?

2216
02:33:25,306 --> 02:33:27,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be okay with it if it was cheaper.

2217
02:33:27,426 --> 02:33:34,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the Korean version, our rates for song purchases are four times what they are in Korea.

2218
02:33:34,648 --> 02:33:36,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really getting screwed here.

2219
02:33:36,648 --> 02:33:37,688
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little ridiculous.

2220
02:33:37,768 --> 02:33:39,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't recommend it past the free songs for that.

2221
02:33:39,889 --> 02:33:41,789
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's worth to check out the free version for the free songs.

2222
02:33:42,029 --> 02:33:43,229
[SPEAKER_04]: The free songs rotate.

2223
02:33:43,309 --> 02:33:44,510
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one thing I noticed.

2224
02:33:44,590 --> 02:33:48,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a song show up the first day that I wanted to play again, and now it was a pay song.

2225
02:33:49,110 --> 02:33:50,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And a different song had showed up instead.

2226
02:33:50,571 --> 02:33:51,771
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think they rotate a little bit.

2227
02:33:52,887 --> 02:33:53,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?

2228
02:33:53,868 --> 02:33:54,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't noticed that yet.

2229
02:33:54,969 --> 02:33:55,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only seen the same free songs.

2230
02:33:55,789 --> 02:33:56,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll probably do that.

2231
02:33:56,750 --> 02:33:57,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I do love it.

2232
02:34:17,822 --> 02:34:24,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of looks like a sound Voltex if you're following Konami games, in a way.

2233
02:34:25,727 --> 02:34:33,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's got that Guitar Hero Hallway-style notes falling at you, and, well, I guess that's really about it.

2234
02:34:34,573 --> 02:34:35,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's musical.

2235
02:34:36,737 --> 02:35:05,739
[SPEAKER_02]: so would you recommend people check out Tapsonic or no it's too damn expensive even though it's free to at least play the Mozart songs awesome I would say download the free thing and if you like it and you want to spend money on it go ahead it's not like you're paying 30 bucks to play three songs or something like that if you buy the points you know you'd probably get a good week's worth of play time if you don't play it like for hours and hours and hours on end so it's not so bad alright well any other games you want to mention

2236
02:35:07,985 --> 02:35:09,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't think so.

2237
02:35:10,266 --> 02:35:10,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

2238
02:35:11,286 --> 02:35:13,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I only called to talk about that since you failed to.

2239
02:35:13,946 --> 02:35:17,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, I'm sorry, so just shame on me forever.

2240
02:35:18,147 --> 02:35:20,008
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be, pretty much.

2241
02:35:20,208 --> 02:35:22,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we let you go, Miklatov, can we get a few bars of Daytona?

2242
02:35:22,868 --> 02:35:24,969
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.

2243
02:35:24,989 --> 02:35:26,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know that song.

2244
02:35:26,509 --> 02:35:27,910
[SPEAKER_02]: What, do-do-do-do-do-do?

2245
02:35:27,950 --> 02:35:28,630
[SPEAKER_04]: How hard is that?

2246
02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:30,130
[SPEAKER_04]: How hard is do-do-do-do-do-do?

2247
02:35:30,150 --> 02:35:31,950
[SPEAKER_10]: You're my hero for not playing along.

2248
02:35:35,074 --> 02:35:35,915
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's cool.

2249
02:35:36,035 --> 02:35:38,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to make that big a fool out of myself.

2250
02:35:38,396 --> 02:35:40,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let other people that call in do that.

2251
02:35:40,838 --> 02:35:41,339
[SPEAKER_04]: You suck.

2252
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:43,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2253
02:35:43,660 --> 02:35:48,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So since you refused to play along with the Daytona, you're going to get a failure noise.

2254
02:35:52,226 --> 02:35:52,987
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the chat room.

2255
02:35:53,007 --> 02:35:53,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to you.

2256
02:35:54,248 --> 02:35:54,668
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2257
02:35:54,908 --> 02:35:55,709
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

2258
02:35:56,269 --> 02:35:56,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind.

2259
02:35:56,870 --> 02:35:57,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a golden wow.

2260
02:35:57,770 --> 02:35:59,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather do that than make noise.

2261
02:35:59,732 --> 02:35:59,952
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2262
02:36:00,352 --> 02:36:01,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, Miklatov.

2263
02:36:02,554 --> 02:36:02,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbye.

2264
02:36:03,328 --> 02:36:04,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch how he dies though

2265
02:36:27,461 --> 02:36:29,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Nancat survival not guaranteed.

2266
02:36:29,882 --> 02:36:31,763
[SPEAKER_04]: High quality rainbow trail.

2267
02:36:32,483 --> 02:36:36,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Just watch this when they actually nail him.

2268
02:36:36,565 --> 02:36:37,846
[SPEAKER_10]: He explodes in color.

2269
02:36:38,046 --> 02:36:39,887
[SPEAKER_04]: He explodes in a barf of color.

2270
02:36:40,147 --> 02:36:40,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

2271
02:36:40,827 --> 02:36:42,067
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fantastic.

2272
02:36:42,127 --> 02:36:42,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones.

2273
02:36:42,828 --> 02:36:43,788
[SPEAKER_04]: We got more calls coming in.

2274
02:36:43,848 --> 02:36:44,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2275
02:36:44,789 --> 02:36:45,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2276
02:36:47,650 --> 02:36:51,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's... You're breaking up a little bit.

2277
02:36:51,672 --> 02:36:52,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you another shot there.

2278
02:36:52,612 --> 02:36:53,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, who's this?

2279
02:36:53,533 --> 02:36:53,933
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your name?

2280
02:36:54,855 --> 02:36:55,736
[SPEAKER_04]: It's CinderWolf.

2281
02:36:56,016 --> 02:36:56,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Much better.

2282
02:36:56,616 --> 02:36:57,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, CinderWolf, what's on your mind?

2283
02:36:58,838 --> 02:36:59,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Not too much.

2284
02:37:00,299 --> 02:37:04,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, you know, thought I'd call in first night I'm listening to the podcast and really loving it.

2285
02:37:05,183 --> 02:37:06,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Great job so far.

2286
02:37:06,324 --> 02:37:07,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

2287
02:37:07,805 --> 02:37:08,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.

2288
02:37:08,526 --> 02:37:09,246
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

2289
02:37:09,266 --> 02:37:10,888
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of the stories we've been talking about tonight?

2290
02:37:11,926 --> 02:37:14,049
[SPEAKER_12]: The stories today have been great.

2291
02:37:14,150 --> 02:37:23,083
[SPEAKER_12]: It's awesome watching and listening to the conversation moving from side to side, top to top, going all over the place.

2292
02:37:23,143 --> 02:37:24,325
[SPEAKER_12]: I find it's really laid back.

2293
02:37:24,365 --> 02:37:26,988
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really impressed with the setup you guys have going on here.

2294
02:37:27,449 --> 02:37:28,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much.

2295
02:37:28,630 --> 02:37:33,074
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like he called just to inflate our egos tonight, and I really appreciate that.

2296
02:37:33,174 --> 02:37:37,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I already have a headache because my skull's not big enough to hold all of my ego.

2297
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:39,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no, it is.

2298
02:37:39,340 --> 02:37:43,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully it's not going to get too much larger than the studio.

2299
02:37:44,105 --> 02:37:46,127
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't a very big room.

2300
02:37:46,747 --> 02:37:48,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know, right?

2301
02:37:49,429 --> 02:37:56,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to note, if folks have only ever listened to the podcast feed and never joined us for a live show, the chatroom is a lot of fun.

2302
02:37:56,511 --> 02:37:59,711
[SPEAKER_04]: And even on a night like tonight where it's kind of a smaller turnout in chat than it usually is.

2303
02:38:00,251 --> 02:38:00,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid Emmys.

2304
02:38:01,132 --> 02:38:02,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, stupid Emmys.

2305
02:38:03,172 --> 02:38:11,154
[SPEAKER_04]: The topic will sometimes be about the show, but then it kind of goes into these related topics and lots of links and fun things to look at.

2306
02:38:11,194 --> 02:38:12,874
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like its own little stumble upon.

2307
02:38:13,354 --> 02:38:13,854
[SPEAKER_04]: or Tumblr.

2308
02:38:13,894 --> 02:38:14,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2309
02:38:14,674 --> 02:38:18,135
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like a domino effect of just sheer awesomeness.

2310
02:38:19,516 --> 02:38:19,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

2311
02:38:20,156 --> 02:38:29,598
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, right now, somebody is asking for the Nyan Cat video, so I said I would link that to me, Rob, and I'll put it on the Tumblr because we're putting stuff on the Tumblr now.

2312
02:38:29,819 --> 02:38:31,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, of course, of course.

2313
02:38:31,199 --> 02:38:31,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

2314
02:38:31,559 --> 02:38:32,999
[SPEAKER_04]: So that people will visit our Tumblr.

2315
02:38:33,059 --> 02:38:33,399
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2316
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:33,700
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2317
02:38:34,660 --> 02:38:35,180
[SPEAKER_04]: You get both.

2318
02:38:36,020 --> 02:38:40,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what do you think about 3DS versus Vita, Cinderwolf, since that's one of the big topics we got into tonight?

2319
02:38:41,042 --> 02:38:42,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a 3DS owner by chance?

2320
02:38:43,690 --> 02:38:45,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I'm not an owner of the 3DS.

2321
02:38:46,092 --> 02:38:50,954
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had the pleasure of playing with it a few times through colleagues, coworkers down at the office.

2322
02:38:51,395 --> 02:38:52,615
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really liking it.

2323
02:38:53,616 --> 02:39:01,740
[SPEAKER_12]: I do love the option of adjusting the intensity of the 3D feature just because it's accommodating to everybody.

2324
02:39:02,081 --> 02:39:07,824
[SPEAKER_12]: The people that typically suffer from things like headaches or migraines with the 3D technology

2325
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:13,271
[SPEAKER_12]: So Nintendo definitely made a great choice in adding that intensity feature.

2326
02:39:14,112 --> 02:39:18,513
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go from like super gigantic headache to just minor headache.

2327
02:39:18,733 --> 02:39:20,393
[SPEAKER_04]: To like slurpy headache.

2328
02:39:20,413 --> 02:39:26,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, going from migraine headaches to I drank a slurpy too fast headache.

2329
02:39:27,115 --> 02:39:27,856
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that type of thing.

2330
02:39:28,816 --> 02:39:29,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

2331
02:39:31,032 --> 02:39:32,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what about the Vita, though?

2332
02:39:32,033 --> 02:39:33,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Vita's coming out pretty soon.

2333
02:39:34,615 --> 02:39:37,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you're a PSP owner or if you're into Sony stuff.

2334
02:39:37,337 --> 02:39:39,238
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about what Sony's doing over there?

2335
02:39:39,838 --> 02:39:47,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I do like Sony's hardware and even Sony's gaming repertoire, but I'm not particularly a fan of their marketing mode.

2336
02:39:47,823 --> 02:39:52,266
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they tend to wait for the competition to see what they can improve on, and that's always a great strategy.

2337
02:39:52,747 --> 02:39:57,710
[SPEAKER_12]: But I find that because they're not trying to stay ahead

2338
02:39:58,409 --> 02:40:04,511
[SPEAKER_12]: in the push everything out first mode, I think they're losing a lot of the possible potential fan base.

2339
02:40:05,631 --> 02:40:19,255
[SPEAKER_12]: What I mentioned earlier in the chat room was that Sony waited for Microsoft to launch their 360 console and now worldwide there have been more 360 consoles sold than the Sony PlayStation 3s.

2340
02:40:20,456 --> 02:40:24,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Xbox seems to have that much wider game repertoire to kind of cater to

2341
02:40:24,827 --> 02:40:25,428
[SPEAKER_12]: Except in Japan.

2342
02:40:25,448 --> 02:40:26,169
[SPEAKER_12]: Except in Japan.

2343
02:40:33,829 --> 02:40:36,390
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, I suppose that is kind of true.

2344
02:40:38,071 --> 02:40:53,179
[SPEAKER_12]: But I find that, you know, comparing the 360 repertoire to the PlayStation, you know, there really are maybe only five or six games so far, say for the PS3, for example, I'm really interested in that I haven't had a chance to play yet.

2345
02:40:53,999 --> 02:41:01,322
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, it seems like Microsoft is hawking, you know, a new game every week that seems to be catching my and Eric's attention too.

2346
02:41:01,343 --> 02:41:02,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

2347
02:41:03,495 --> 02:41:06,358
[SPEAKER_12]: so I'm feeling it'll be similar with the Vita

2348
02:41:23,714 --> 02:41:26,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask you one other quick question since you are a first time caller of the show.

2349
02:41:27,355 --> 02:41:30,036
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?

2350
02:41:30,236 --> 02:41:32,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I always ask this of listeners.

2351
02:41:32,236 --> 02:41:35,537
[SPEAKER_04]: This kind of helps me understand what kind of a gamer our listeners are.

2352
02:41:35,977 --> 02:41:42,379
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you say is your favorite video game of all time or if you're having trouble picking just one, one of your favorite video games of all time?

2353
02:41:44,263 --> 02:41:56,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, favorite game of all time right now, it's an old game, I think it was released back in 1990 on the TurboGrafx-16 console by NEC, it was called Newtopia 2.

2354
02:41:58,020 --> 02:42:02,123
[SPEAKER_12]: It was sort of NEC and Hudson Soft's attempt at a Zelda killer.

2355
02:42:02,584 --> 02:42:05,186
[SPEAKER_12]: The TurboGrafx released a year before the Super Nintendo console.

2356
02:42:06,007 --> 02:42:11,672
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really has a lot of the traditional RPG elements in it, like the old Zelda games.

2357
02:42:11,972 --> 02:42:16,096
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, great soundtrack too, even more so than, say, the old Zelda games.

2358
02:42:16,956 --> 02:42:21,499
[SPEAKER_12]: and I don't know, I find it a fun run right from start to finish.

2359
02:42:21,879 --> 02:42:26,502
[SPEAKER_12]: You can do it in a handful of hours, five, six hours, but it's just very addicting I find.

2360
02:42:26,942 --> 02:42:29,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely remember the Nootopia series.

2361
02:42:29,103 --> 02:42:30,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you covered that on the show before, DarkSakura?

2362
02:42:30,644 --> 02:42:31,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong.

2363
02:42:31,305 --> 02:42:32,525
[SPEAKER_09]: I have indeed covered Nootopia.

2364
02:42:32,726 --> 02:42:34,767
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's good times.

2365
02:42:34,987 --> 02:42:37,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the highlights of the TurboGrafx-16.

2366
02:42:38,529 --> 02:42:43,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you brought up TurboGrafx in chat earlier, so you must have been a big fan many years ago.

2367
02:42:45,110 --> 02:42:45,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I did.

2368
02:42:45,871 --> 02:42:50,314
[SPEAKER_12]: See, growing up, my family, you know, we didn't have the standard Nintendo or Super Nintendo console.

2369
02:42:50,614 --> 02:42:56,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Dad had the old ColecoVision and Ataris, and then we jumped right into the TurboGrafx mode sort of deal.

2370
02:42:56,438 --> 02:42:58,639
[SPEAKER_12]: So I kind of grew up playing a lot of that.

2371
02:42:59,500 --> 02:43:05,424
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually had the pleasure of finding one in a flea market about three years ago, so it's soaked up to the HDTV.

2372
02:43:05,484 --> 02:43:05,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.

2373
02:43:06,344 --> 02:43:07,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you had a duo before?

2374
02:43:10,004 --> 02:43:11,565
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I haven't, actually.

2375
02:43:11,725 --> 02:43:16,746
[SPEAKER_12]: I've wanted to find one, but other costs and other bills are kind of trumping that right now.

2376
02:43:17,187 --> 02:43:26,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I can tell you right now, if you're looking to play any of the imports, that it actually is going to... We had some converter, but the converters hardly ever work.

2377
02:43:27,270 --> 02:43:29,051
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can get the core graphics really cheap.

2378
02:43:30,491 --> 02:43:31,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that is true.

2379
02:43:32,071 --> 02:43:45,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I mean, although I do like the idea of the duo, it's kind of funny, my little brother back home actually hooked me up with a lot of the old ROMs and emulators, actually, that I can just, you know, I play on my own time here.

2380
02:43:46,154 --> 02:43:46,934
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Magic Engine?

2381
02:43:48,815 --> 02:43:50,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, actually.

2382
02:43:50,495 --> 02:43:54,796
[SPEAKER_12]: I use the Magic Engine actually for all the TurboGrafx games that are out there so far, so...

2383
02:43:56,237 --> 02:43:59,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have a fan in chat because GameGuru says Newtopia is awesome!

2384
02:43:59,738 --> 02:44:00,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Newtopia is pretty cool.

2385
02:44:00,878 --> 02:44:02,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a good series.

2386
02:44:02,299 --> 02:44:03,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played it once, too.

2387
02:44:03,559 --> 02:44:07,880
[SPEAKER_10]: There's just a number, if you're really into TurboGrafx, there's a number of duo games that you've got to check out.

2388
02:44:10,301 --> 02:44:11,361
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty sure there were two.

2389
02:44:11,441 --> 02:44:17,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, my younger brother back home, a bit more of a classic-slash-hardcore old school gamer than myself...

2390
02:44:18,604 --> 02:44:20,765
[SPEAKER_12]: He's constantly telling me about the older titles that he's finding.

2391
02:44:21,865 --> 02:44:30,128
[SPEAKER_12]: But just one of the funniest things that might actually throw you guys off, that the one game on Utopia 2, the actual copy on eBay, $256.

2392
02:44:30,828 --> 02:44:31,488
[SPEAKER_10]: You're kidding me.

2393
02:44:32,589 --> 02:44:32,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope.

2394
02:44:33,349 --> 02:44:35,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that like just the HuCard?

2395
02:44:36,650 --> 02:44:38,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that just the HuCard or like with everything?

2396
02:44:39,737 --> 02:44:46,544
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the original CD case that came in on the HuCard itself, the little game booklet, everything.

2397
02:44:46,664 --> 02:44:49,467
[SPEAKER_12]: It's used, obviously, but yeah, $256.

2398
02:44:49,948 --> 02:44:51,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, I think we got ours in a stack of games.

2399
02:44:53,289 --> 02:44:59,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, well, I'm sure my dad's going to kick himself in the ass when he finds out what it's going for, because I think we paid five bucks for it back in the day.

2400
02:44:59,976 --> 02:45:00,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet.

2401
02:45:00,697 --> 02:45:01,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Good gosh.

2402
02:45:01,838 --> 02:45:02,159
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2403
02:45:02,559 --> 02:45:08,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I let this call go on a little long, but that's okay, because he's a first-time caller, so those of you that call every week can just deal.

2404
02:45:09,046 --> 02:45:11,709
[SPEAKER_04]: But before I let you go, can we get a few bars at Daytona?

2405
02:45:13,690 --> 02:45:15,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, alright, alright.

2406
02:45:15,711 --> 02:45:19,572
[SPEAKER_12]: I can only do the beginning because, again, I never decided to play the game.

2407
02:45:19,592 --> 02:45:21,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Never really peaked my interest back in the day.

2408
02:45:21,373 --> 02:45:24,834
[SPEAKER_12]: But from what I heard, it's Daytona!

2409
02:45:24,974 --> 02:45:26,034
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that's about it.

2410
02:45:26,995 --> 02:45:28,335
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of the jazzy version.

2411
02:45:28,575 --> 02:45:29,756
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Daytona!

2412
02:45:29,916 --> 02:45:31,076
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a little bit jazzy.

2413
02:45:31,116 --> 02:45:32,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I like that.

2414
02:45:32,517 --> 02:45:32,877
[SPEAKER_04]: A+.

2415
02:45:33,017 --> 02:45:37,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well thank you so much for your call and thanks for enjoying the show and tuning in live and all that good stuff.

2416
02:45:37,699 --> 02:45:38,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thanks so much.

2417
02:45:40,041 --> 02:45:43,023
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be around for the foreseeable future, guys.

2418
02:45:43,043 --> 02:45:44,023
[SPEAKER_12]: So thanks for letting me stay on.

2419
02:45:44,384 --> 02:45:44,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2420
02:45:45,664 --> 02:45:46,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Take it easy.

2421
02:45:46,465 --> 02:45:46,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2422
02:45:48,706 --> 02:45:53,629
[SPEAKER_04]: We love Canadians, and we love... Clearly, I mentioned he was from Canada earlier.

2423
02:45:53,649 --> 02:45:54,770
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in the chat.

2424
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:55,470
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Cinderwolf?

2425
02:45:55,530 --> 02:45:56,651
[SPEAKER_04]: His accent was Canadian, too.

2426
02:45:56,691 --> 02:45:56,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2427
02:45:58,292 --> 02:46:00,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And we love TurboGrafx fans, too.

2428
02:46:00,533 --> 02:46:02,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So very, very cool.

2429
02:46:03,151 --> 02:46:03,771
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

2430
02:46:27,709 --> 02:46:28,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So what the heck?

2431
02:46:29,111 --> 02:46:29,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this one.

2432
02:46:30,111 --> 02:46:32,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a mod that he sent us.

2433
02:46:32,854 --> 02:46:34,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Super Pixel Brothers.

2434
02:46:35,517 --> 02:46:36,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess what is this?

2435
02:46:36,798 --> 02:46:40,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a playable Super Mario Brothers, but it's only 64 pixels?

2436
02:46:42,603 --> 02:46:47,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's an 8x8 LED board that does Super Mario Bros.

2437
02:46:47,866 --> 02:46:50,828
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can't imagine this at all looks pretty.

2438
02:46:50,908 --> 02:46:52,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's gotta be terrible.

2439
02:46:52,710 --> 02:46:53,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2440
02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:54,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see what this looks like here.

2441
02:46:54,991 --> 02:46:59,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm trying to load up the video in chat, but it's... Here we go.

2442
02:46:59,494 --> 02:46:59,814
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

2443
02:47:02,608 --> 02:47:12,130
[SPEAKER_01]: You get points for hitting blocks, and under certain blocks, and I've actually made it random, you get 5 points, whereas just normal blocks you get 2.

2444
02:47:15,509 --> 02:47:17,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Now another feature I've added is Firepower.

2445
02:47:17,931 --> 02:47:19,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Different colored blocks.

2446
02:47:19,932 --> 02:47:25,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's literally the Nintendo ROM, but it looks like somebody made their own version of it.

2447
02:47:27,117 --> 02:47:33,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine one of those old school LED games where there's only so many places you can have a cutout.

2448
02:47:34,943 --> 02:47:43,529
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically these colored lights and the little Mario is like an orange square that kind of goes around and you can break blocks and jump on top of things.

2449
02:47:44,589 --> 02:47:48,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say, this is much more impressive than what I was thinking it was going to look like.

2450
02:47:48,752 --> 02:47:50,294
[SPEAKER_04]: And these levels are... It's sad.

2451
02:47:50,374 --> 02:47:53,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I recognize these levels based off of the real game.

2452
02:47:54,176 --> 02:47:55,778
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been translated really well.

2453
02:47:56,578 --> 02:47:59,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's... I gotta say, that's pretty cool.

2454
02:48:00,641 --> 02:48:01,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, not bad.

2455
02:48:01,562 --> 02:48:04,244
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess, DarkSakura, I got one more link for you.

2456
02:48:05,185 --> 02:48:05,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2457
02:48:05,705 --> 02:48:08,507
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't you go post that on the Tumblrs.

2458
02:48:09,208 --> 02:48:11,429
[SPEAKER_04]: People who are watching Tumblr are going to say, it blew up tonight.

2459
02:48:12,730 --> 02:48:13,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2460
02:48:14,474 --> 02:48:16,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that does it for the Twitter tonight.

2461
02:48:16,535 --> 02:48:22,619
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we wrap up the show, I always like to check in with Loki and DarkSakura and see if they have any last-minute stories.

2462
02:48:24,280 --> 02:48:24,460
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2463
02:48:26,081 --> 02:48:26,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

2464
02:48:27,001 --> 02:48:27,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

2465
02:48:27,261 --> 02:48:32,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is an Overclocked Remix album I think someone made for Mega Man 9.

2466
02:48:33,445 --> 02:48:40,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all guitar and metal versions of the song, so I believe that's free to download on the Overclocked Remix site.

2467
02:48:41,303 --> 02:48:43,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Overclock puts out some good stuff, so that's good.

2468
02:48:43,625 --> 02:48:45,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to hear.

2469
02:48:46,547 --> 02:48:49,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2470
02:48:50,210 --> 02:48:55,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and supporting it and telling friends about the show.

2471
02:48:55,054 --> 02:48:55,995
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we really appreciate.

2472
02:48:57,304 --> 02:48:59,025
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a big budget behind this show.

2473
02:48:59,125 --> 02:49:02,407
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have commercials and what have you.

2474
02:49:02,768 --> 02:49:06,870
[SPEAKER_04]: All we ask, if you enjoyed Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

2475
02:49:07,391 --> 02:49:11,093
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're like, but I have no friends to tell about the show, then tell an enemy.

2476
02:49:11,313 --> 02:49:14,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can leave us a nice review on iTunes.

2477
02:49:14,756 --> 02:49:16,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us spread the word around the internet.

2478
02:49:16,077 --> 02:49:18,018
[SPEAKER_04]: That whole nomination for podcast award thing I was talking about.

2479
02:49:18,278 --> 02:49:19,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Just help us spread the word.

2480
02:49:19,279 --> 02:49:20,119
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we ask.

2481
02:49:20,580 --> 02:49:26,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll get more listeners next week, just like we had Cinderwolf tonight, who seemed to enjoy this program very much.

2482
02:49:26,203 --> 02:49:26,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you very much.

2483
02:49:27,684 --> 02:49:31,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we wrap it up, though, for good, I need to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2484
02:49:32,349 --> 02:49:33,530
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's see.

2485
02:49:33,570 --> 02:49:34,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, we'll start with you tonight.

2486
02:49:34,631 --> 02:49:35,352
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your final thought?

2487
02:49:35,919 --> 02:49:38,600
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?

2488
02:49:38,981 --> 02:49:43,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know why my scroll lock button keeps turning on when I don't press anything to turn on my scroll lock

2489
02:50:06,257 --> 02:50:07,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those great mysteries of space.

2490
02:50:08,277 --> 02:50:09,218
[SPEAKER_10]: The world may never know.

2491
02:50:09,358 --> 02:50:09,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in space.

2492
02:50:10,958 --> 02:50:11,398
[SPEAKER_04]: That does it.

2493
02:50:11,418 --> 02:50:13,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for downloading us.

2494
02:50:13,679 --> 02:50:15,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I will see you in like three weeks.

2495
02:50:15,739 --> 02:50:16,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, that's kind of sad.

2496
02:50:17,539 --> 02:50:19,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys, but I'll be having fun.

2497
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:24,021
[SPEAKER_04]: But DarkSakura and Loki will be back here next week with Tiara to bring you more gaming news.

2498
02:50:24,181 --> 02:50:28,302
[SPEAKER_04]: So tune in and we'll do it all again in one more week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2499
02:50:28,342 --> 02:50:28,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.

2500
02:50:29,574 --> 02:50:32,395
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2501
02:50:32,875 --> 02:50:36,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2502
02:50:36,577 --> 02:50:45,221
[SPEAKER_05]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2503
02:50:45,721 --> 02:50:57,326
[SPEAKER_05]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

2504
02:50:57,946 --> 02:50:58,767
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next week!

2505
02:51:00,984 --> 02:51:02,080
Thanks for watching!
