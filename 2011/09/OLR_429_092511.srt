00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,600
The PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch, and Sony adds a controversial new

2
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:32,440
section to the PSN terms of service.

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,640
Hello and welcome to episode 429 of this derpisode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,160
I am your hostess of the evening, DarkSakura, and with me always is our techmaster, Loki.

5
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
Hello.

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,960
Yes, this is take two because someone was forgetting to start recording.

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,560
Because someone's very jealous that Rob's off seeing Ladytron tonight in San Francisco.

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
Blah.

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,120
So anyway, what are we?

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,600
We are the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,400
Be it digitized, or if we're saying it for you, or whatever.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,200
So over the next few hours we will be talking about game stuff, and we tape live every week

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,200
on allgamesradio.com.

14
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,800
And that starts at six o'clock pacific time, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,160
And if you're listening to us live, get in our chat room.

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,000
It's chat dot Orange Lounge Radio dot com, and we are on Game Surge server.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,240
So Loki, again, how was Earth Defense Force?

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,480
It was good.

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,160
That's what I've been playing this week among other things like Grand Theft Auto.

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:39,280
Of course, as I was saying, the survival mode in that game, it's difficult because they

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,520
basically give you the lowest tier weapons possible, and then they put you up against

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,520
lots and lots of really hard bugs.

23
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,520
And thankfully you do get up to six players, which is kind of cool, although we didn't

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,440
get to play very long because our internet connection at work is kind of sketchy.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:04,440
It drops us every now and then, or more often than every now and then, pretty often actually.

26
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
And then, you know, Grand Theft Auto.

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,240
That was the usual Grand Theft Auto stuff.

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,680
Still trying to keep my winning streak going.

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,120
And what else did I try?

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,320
Well actually, it wasn't really game-related, but I did mess around with the Xbox Marketplace

31
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
a little bit.

32
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,000
I watched my wife on the Watch An Episode of Up All Night, and so we watched that real

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,880
quick and it actually worked out pretty good.

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,560
I never really used the Zune Marketplace before, so that was kind of neat.

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,640
And then also got to check out, well, I browsed and buy some of the Xbox Live and E Games,

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,440
and man, there's some weird shit on there.

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
I don't even know.

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,440
There was a game I saw that was about prank calling people.

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,720
There was the Babymaker Extreme 2, I know, and we've talked about that before.

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
Looks hilarious.

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,460
I didn't pick it up though, but just a lot of stuff that's on there that's not great,

42
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,600
but it is kind of hard to navigate everything, so hopefully they fix that and maybe with

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,700
one of these updates, maybe the next fall dashboard update will fix the store a little

44
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,000
bit so it's easier to find stuff.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,520
I think that's really all that I've played.

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Maybe a little bit more Zelda.

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,720
I don't remember if I actually played that or not this week, but yeah, that's about it.

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,200
I played well.

49
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
That's it.

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,080
Well, you're consistent.

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,720
So moving forward, as has been mentioned, Rob isn't here, so we're doing a short show

52
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,120
tonight, but everyone needs to be a little pumped for what's coming on a little after.

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,760
I'm doing a throwback to the past so that people don't feel like we're shortchanging

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,840
them because we love you, not in a romantic way or anything, but in a way.

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,880
We do.

56
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,920
So why don't we go ahead and get right into our stories of the night.

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
All right.

58
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,480
Well, it's been kind of the longest anticipated announcement, at least this year.

59
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,600
People are starting to get worried that Star Wars The Old Republic wasn't going to be coming

60
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,400
out this year, and maybe it prompted them to announce a release date for this year based

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,720
on the fact that certain other games may be coming out a little later.

62
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,160
But yes, The Old Republic will be shipping on December 20th, and of course they do have

63
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,820
some details on what it's going to cost you.

64
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,400
They have different subscription packages.

65
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,720
You can go month to month, which is $14.99.

66
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,000
Of course, each game does come with a 30-day subscription that runs out, and after 30 days

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,480
you have to pay for it.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,600
If you choose to pay for some of your months in a lump sum, you will save a little bit

69
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
of money.

70
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,520
Three months at a time will break it down to $13.99 a month, and then six months at

71
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,660
a time, $12.99 a month.

72
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,320
So if you're dedicated to playing this game for a long time, maybe the lump sums are the

73
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
way to go.

74
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
You know what?

75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
What?

76
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,000
I had the opportunity to get a lifetime membership for Star Trek Online, and now I'm very glad

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,840
I didn't because it's going free to play.

78
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,320
So, I would advise everyone, hold off.

79
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,680
Well, lifetime memberships, yeah, you might hold off on that because you never know the

80
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,400
life cycle of these games nowadays that a lot of them grow up free to play, but six

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
months isn't bad.

82
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,360
I imagine that Star Wars games are going to be around for at least six months.

83
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,200
Yeah, well, who knows?

84
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:24,960
I mean, I quit playing, well no, that was February of, no I started playing in February,

85
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,600
I quit actually a year ago.

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Star Trek Online.

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
This month.

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
No.

89
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Nope, in two months, sorry.

90
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,880
Anyway, but yeah, I'd say though, six months is fine, but if they offer any type of lifetime

91
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,160
thing, don't do it.

92
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Don't do it.

93
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,240
Not even if they give you a lightsaber that works.

94
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,800
Well, maybe that's worth it.

95
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,440
Well, in other news, we have something about Sega of Europe.

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,200
John Smedley is saying that they're a free to play model for DC.

97
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Sony.

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Sony.

99
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Sony Entertainment.

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
I don't know why I said Sony.

101
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,960
You know what?

102
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
I'm derp.

103
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
I'm still mad at Rob.

104
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,520
I'm still mad at Rob.

105
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,920
I'm not really mad at Rob.

106
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Okay.

107
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,800
Sony Online Entertainment has a free to play model for DC Universe Online.

108
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,840
So it's going to be three membership levels.

109
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,440
There's free, premium, and legendary.

110
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,480
And they have full access to the game that has different levels of flexibility.

111
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,440
So free players will have two character slots and new downloadable game packs and updates.

112
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
Additional character slots, you can pay for them.

113
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,080
I refuse to use the term micro transaction.

114
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,840
Premium, so that's going to be people who have spent at least $5 on the game.

115
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,560
That's including former subscribers and in game item purchasers will have additional

116
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,200
character slots, inventory slots, and higher cash limits.

117
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,800
Legendary will have the maximum, including free DLC.

118
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,560
More than 15 character slots and more than 80 inventory slots for $15 a month.

119
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,160
And this is happening really soon, as in next week.

120
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Yeah.

121
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
So that means I can play the game.

122
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Yeah, because it's funny.

123
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Because I ain't going to pay for it.

124
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
We got the message there.

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,960
Yeah, you need to tell all your customers to send them back their copies of DC Universe

126
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,200
because we're making it free to play, so they don't need those discs anymore.

127
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,320
Well, I will be trying it out, but honestly I'm glad I didn't pay for it.

128
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,480
Yeah, I think a lot of these MMOs should go free to play.

129
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,880
I'm telling you, if Final Fantasy XI ever goes free to play, god I don't know.

130
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,760
I may have to get back into that.

131
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,720
And Nelly will wonder what happened to you.

132
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,000
Well no, it's not that big a deal because really the whole thing is I couldn't see myself

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,760
paying I think it was $13 a month or something like that for Final Fantasy XI, but I was

134
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,680
only playing it maybe one evening a month.

135
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,360
I can't see myself paying for that because it's just a waste of money.

136
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,480
But free to play, that would be fine.

137
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:05,280
I really wish I hadn't sold my, you know, or not really sell my stuff, but give away

138
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,000
my stuff that I had in my bar.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But whatever.

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah.

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,220
That would be fun.

142
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,560
Some more information going along the lines with, it's not really an MMO, but maybe the

143
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,400
reason why the older republic did announce to be shipping this year, Diablo 3 is actually

144
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,200
going to launch early 2012.

145
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,400
It's not going to make it out this year unfortunately.

146
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,640
They did mention that they're going to extend the beta period of course since obviously

147
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,920
the game's going to be coming out later on, they have more time to test it and hopefully

148
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,200
get any kinks out of it.

149
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,080
Of course they're saying, you know, while the news may not be a complete surprise, I

150
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,200
know many of you were hopeful that Diablo 3 would ship this year.

151
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
We were too.

152
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,640
Of course, they're ultimately, we felt to deliver an awesome Diablo sequel that lives

153
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,540
up to our expectations and yours as well, we should take a little more time to add further

154
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,500
polish to a few different elements of the game.

155
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,600
So in other words, it was buggy and they needed to fix it.

156
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
So that's fine.

157
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,200
Well what else is new?

158
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,520
There's too much stuff coming out this year anyways.

159
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,480
Yeah, I just, they actually were starting to put out little warnings on World of Warcraft

160
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,120
by the way, that if someone messages you saying, oh you've got the Diablo 3 pass here, give

161
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,400
us your password, blah blah blah.

162
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,600
If you give anyone your password, you're stupid, sorry.

163
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,560
I don't even think that people sending out ones for Diablo 3 should be enough to make

164
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,280
people lose control of their facilities.

165
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Should people like to-

166
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Their faculties.

167
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
That'd be funny.

168
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
I said facilities.

169
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Whatever.

170
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Their brain.

171
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Whatever.

172
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,320
Well anyway, so let's move forward into other news, shall we?

173
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
We shall.

174
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,680
Speaking of Blizzard, they are talking about patch 4.3, which everyone has been all abuzz

175
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
about in-game.

176
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,920
You know, we get transmogrifying.

177
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,720
That means you can make your new shit look like old shit.

178
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,660
So that people don't all look the same.

179
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,720
And then there's gonna be, and I was reading up on this the other day, and it's actually

180
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,200
kind of exciting, is that there is a new raid content that's gonna take place all over the

181
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,560
world of Azeroth.

182
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,440
I thought for a second there, and I know this is wrong, that you said rape content, and

183
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,080
I was like, what?

184
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
That's weird.

185
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,240
Well you know what, actually in the Firelands, there's a, the first boss has a dog with him

186
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,280
named Rageface, but everyone calls him Rapeface.

187
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,160
His attack is called Face Rage, so we just call it Face Rape.

188
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,640
That's awesome.

189
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Yeah.

190
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,280
Anyway, Deathwing's just not sitting around, you know, because before all he had, you know,

191
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,600
all he was doing was showing up in areas and burning people to death if they were on the

192
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,740
ground and not in the air.

193
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,880
Trust me, I took forever to get that stupid achievement.

194
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,960
So he's going to be a raid, you actually have to go into the future, go into the past, and

195
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,240
the whole thing is gonna end on the dragon's back, so you have to pull off pieces of his

196
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,460
plate armor as he's spinning down into the Maelstrom, ooh, and then, you know, get all

197
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,440
stabby on him and maybe try to kill him, or at least, you know, make him really pissed

198
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,120
off at you.

199
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,160
It's supposed to be really, really huge, and I was reading some of the technical development

200
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,160
behind it and said that they've had to really pull some technical strings to get it to work.

201
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,480
I'm looking forward to seeing it, although honestly right now it's gonna be forever.

202
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,680
And then like I said earlier, there is transmogrifying, so basically you can only change, like, one

203
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,200
type of armor to look like the same type of armor of another level.

204
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,960
So like, you can't change cloth mail to plate mail, you know, make it look like plate mail,

205
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,260
and you can't make your axe look like a polearm.

206
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,440
It has to be the same type of stuff, and it's gotta be something with stats on it.

207
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,480
And then void storage is coming out, which is basically if you've got a bunch of stuff

208
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,300
that you were tired of sitting in your regular storage, and you think, I'm never gonna get

209
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,620
back to it, but for some reason I'm a pack rat and can't sell it, ew, then you can put

210
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,080
it in your void storage and it removes all enchants and socketing, and you have to pay

211
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,520
a lot of money to get it out.

212
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,640
So that's it.

213
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,360
And then of course, like I said, the Deathwing smackdown.

214
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,400
This is kind of interesting, there was a story on Rock Paper Shocking this week, talking

215
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,320
about, you know how there's a lot of these folding projects, the Folding at Home is a

216
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,900
really popular one, well there was one, I guess it was a little bit newer, called Foldit,

217
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:45,080
and what Foldit is, is it's not just folding with your actual system or PC or whatever

218
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:51,760
that you're using, it does require some human interaction as well, so think of it like mind

219
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,520
folding, I guess.

220
00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:00,560
Basically they were using this to kind of figure out how viruses like the AIDS virus

221
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:08,600
worked and stuff like that, also cancer and Alzheimer's as well, and guess these are related

222
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:15,280
to proteins and what the project does is I guess, basically it's spatial recognition

223
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,880
or something, where players will, I'm not really sure what you do, but apparently it

224
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,080
has something to do with matching stuff and based on your results and what they have in

225
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:34,120
here, they have I guess figured out how these actually work now, so it's kind of cool, because

226
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,240
apparently this is going to lead to obviously research and testing and whatnot, but it will

227
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,480
actually lead to maybe even a cure for these diseases, thanks to this folding project,

228
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,120
and it's pretty impressive I guess.

229
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,600
So yeah, they're saying Foldit players leverage human three-dimensional problem solving skills

230
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,560
to interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and algorithms from

231
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,460
the Rosetta structure prediction mythology, and says players collaborate with teammates

232
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:11,600
while competing with other players to obtain the highest score, lowest energy models, and

233
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,400
proof of concept tests.

234
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,320
Foldit players, most of whom have little or no background in biochemistry, were able to

235
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,620
solve protein structure refinement problems in which backbone rearrangement was necessary

236
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,200
to correctly bury hydrophobic residues.

237
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:38,680
Here we report Foldit players' successes in real world modeling problems with complex

238
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,720
deviations from native structures leading to the solution of a long-standing protein

239
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:53,600
crystal structure problem, and they said basically, yeah this is going to possibly lead to a cure

240
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,160
for this stuff, so that's pretty amazing.

241
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,040
Seems to me like in some cases education might get in the way of intuition, don't you think?

242
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Yeah.

243
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,400
Some people have a natural aptitude towards solving puzzles as long as you give it to

244
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,080
them in a term that they're going to understand it.

245
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,120
Yeah, and then they go on to comment a little bit more, they said, the critical role of

246
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:23,760
Foldit players in the solution of the M-PMV PR structure shows the power of online games

247
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,800
to channel human intuition and three-dimensional pattern matching skills to solve challenging

248
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,280
scientific problems, although much attention has been recently given to the potential of

249
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,600
crowdsourcing and game playing, this is the first instance that we are aware of in which

250
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,400
online players solve the long-standing scientific problem.

251
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,920
These results indicate potential for integrating video games into real world scientific process.

252
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,720
The ingenuity of the game players is formidable force that if properly directed can be used

253
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,680
to solve a wide range of scientific problems, so you never know, they may be just using

254
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:07,160
this for other diseases, obviously potential is unlimited, new forms of energy, who knows?

255
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,400
I was reading before that they had broken what was one of the HIV virus models, right?

256
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,080
Yeah, this is what that's about.

257
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:21,880
So think if they've come to that, this could be applied towards cancers, tumors, just about

258
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
anything.

259
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Yeah.

260
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,400
It really is a good way to get new resources, because any type of research, if it hits a

261
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,880
dead end, it's going to need a fresh pair of eyes and a fresh brain to go with it.

262
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,840
And the folded thing hasn't even been around that long, it's basically 236,000 players,

263
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,760
which as far as compared to folding the home, I think that's a lot less than what they've

264
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
got.

265
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:51,060
Instead I guess that they've been working together the last three years, and it only

266
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:57,660
took them 10 days to unravel that actual scientific problem there.

267
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,520
So that one alone, 10 days with that many people, can you imagine if they just integrated

268
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:09,160
this into all the places that the folding the home stuff is, it could be pretty powerful.

269
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:15,060
And another thing too, this actually says a lot for the spirit of cooperation.

270
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,240
This is a lot, even though they have it set up as a competition in the end, it's a lot

271
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,400
of people working together, and they're getting results by people having a common goal and

272
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
working towards it.

273
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,800
And I think that we could all stand to learn something from that.

274
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
Yeah.

275
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Cool.

276
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,280
So, moving forward, man that's actually super cool though.

277
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,440
I mean I'm still kind of, whenever I try to think about the possibilities for that it

278
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,920
actually makes my brain hurt a little bit.

279
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,320
So how about something that won't make my brain hurt that much, because honestly it's

280
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
not surprising.

281
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:55,280
28% of 3DS users do not like the 3D feature, they say it detracts from their games.

282
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,440
There was a study done out by the research firm Interpret LLC that said 22% of those

283
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,760
thought the 3D improved gameplay, but 13% were so put off by the effect that they turned

284
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,280
it off altogether.

285
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:17,420
56% also found that their ideal 3D gaming experience was a 3D capable console connected

286
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:23,920
to a TV, with only 7% giving a nod towards the 3DS.

287
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:31,840
I think right now it's still really early, I think a lot of games aren't using it correctly.

288
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,720
And even this goes to Nintendo, some of their design choices in games are really stupid,

289
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,320
especially with Star Fox where they have the tilt controls and then the 3D, that doesn't

290
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
work.

291
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,520
It's going to break the 3D because your 3D method requires people to basically have a

292
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,420
certain perspective that you view the screen at, and if you're turning and tilting the

293
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,120
screen around it's going to break that and it's going to turn it 2D anyways.

294
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,000
Granted you could turn the 3D off and play with the tilt controls or turn it on and play

295
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,400
with it without tilt controls, but to fully utilize the game it's kind of impossible the

296
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,200
way that they have it I guess, unless you're supposed to tilt your whole body with that

297
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
which is kind of stupid.

298
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,200
But yeah, 3D consoles I think is definitely the way to go.

299
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,600
Have you noticed though that some people when they play a game that requires turning and

300
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,880
things that they'll lean with their controller?

301
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,040
Yeah when you're 5, I mean I don't think anyone does that anymore.

302
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,980
I do if I really get into it, like when I was playing Katamari though I'd get motion

303
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,480
sick so I'd actually follow the direction of the TV to keep from getting motion sick.

304
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,800
Yeah I see and I...

305
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,540
Then again the 3DS makes me motion sick anyway.

306
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,540
I don't know.

307
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,360
The moment the 3D breaks my head hurts.

308
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,000
Maybe people they don't play games a lot because they just get really into it, but I don't

309
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,240
think I've ever done that.

310
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,240
I don't need my little pony in 3D.

311
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,120
I just, I don't know, I don't really...

312
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,200
The only time I ever see that nowadays is when they have a stupid, you know, PR shot

313
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,560
of people playing a video game and they're so excited!

314
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,440
They're so psyched to be playing the game and they're just really getting into it.

315
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,920
But I mean it's just, it's just not real.

316
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,640
Now this is something that I think is a little derpy.

317
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:20,360
Is that they basically said that awareness of the device was up 60% on this time last

318
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:27,720
year but 28% of that total weren't aware that it required, that it didn't require 3D glasses.

319
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,640
Well yeah because they're probably interviewing people that have no idea what these consoles

320
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
are.

321
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,520
I mean there's a lot of people out there that don't know what, you know, the gaming consoles

322
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
offer.

323
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,080
I mean how even some celebrities.

324
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:45,400
I remember that video they have of Orlando Bloom and Mark Ruffalo signing him an Xbox.

325
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,880
Orlando Bloom didn't know what, you know, what that was.

326
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,400
He thought, you know, is this the one, Blu-ray?

327
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,800
I mean he didn't know because he's busy fucking making money and working.

328
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,160
He hasn't had time to, you know, game and that kind of stuff but there's a lot of people

329
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:06,000
out there that aren't really into games and aren't really aware of what's out there.

330
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,240
I mean, granted, I think they've stepped up their advertising quite a bit for the 3DS

331
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,240
now especially since they've dropped the price.

332
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,120
They're kind of highlighting what's coming out in the fourth quarter with, you know,

333
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,400
the Zelda and not, well they still show Zelda, Zelda Star Fox, Mario 3D, or Super Mario 3D

334
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,880
Land and Mario Kart 7.

335
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,400
So there's going to be a lot of awareness going into the fourth quarter about, you know,

336
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
the 3DS.

337
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:39,960
3D stuff for the Playstation a little bit, I think no whatsoever mention for the 3D stuff

338
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,680
that they have on the 360 because there are a lot of games that do support 3D on the Xbox

339
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:51,960
360 but there's no mention of that because first party wise they don't really, well actually

340
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,880
I guess Gears 3 did, but first party wise they don't really support 3D too much.

341
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,080
It's mainly just the third parties, the cross platform stuff like, you know, Batman Arkham

342
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,760
Asylum or, yeah actually Arkham Asylum had 3D support, not the stereoscopic, you know,

343
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:16,680
shutter glasses 3D but the red cyan glasses and then they also have, but Arkham City does

344
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,120
have 3D support and there's some other games that do support 3D.

345
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:28,280
It's just, it's not really advertised widely I guess.

346
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,920
Huh.

347
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:37,440
Well it, you know what, now I'm trying to picture playing through, not like the old

348
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,320
school cyan magenta, like the newer ones, right?

349
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,120
That you don't really see cyan and magenta.

350
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,400
I've honestly, I haven't used those types of glasses in a long time and I still think

351
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,000
that all I see is cyan and magenta and that stuff.

352
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,540
I mean, it would be awesome if they had some sort of glasses like that that I didn't see

353
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:01,360
that but I've never, I haven't seen anything like that recently that doesn't affect the

354
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,800
color.

355
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,240
I went to a movie not too long ago that used one of the services that was a cyan and magenta

356
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,600
but it was a very pale one.

357
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
It was interesting.

358
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,360
You really couldn't see it.

359
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,840
But moving forward, shall we?

360
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Release dates.

361
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,960
Yes, Wii has release dates.

362
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,720
The US is still gonna have a lot of stuff coming out this week.

363
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,760
Of course, because we're in the fourth quarter technically.

364
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,080
So starting things off, we've got FIFA Soccer 12 on the Wii, coming out a little bit later

365
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,640
than the rest of the platforms.

366
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,360
Some re-releases from THQ, they've got a Beach Fun 2-pack, it's just some of their old party

367
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,720
games, and a Game Show Fun pack which is Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, that's on the Wii.

368
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,920
Sun Slinger from Valkon, it's a generic on-rail shooter game for the Wii.

369
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,800
Quest for Zoo from Activision.

370
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,080
Cabela's, there's the first of four Cabela's games this year.

371
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,600
We've got Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012, it's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and

372
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,640

373
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,960
Another game from Activision, X-Men Destiny, which is kind of an X-Men themed brawler game.

374
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,120
It's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

375
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,600
Atelier Totri, The Adventurer of Arland, coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.

376
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,400

On PS3, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, Classic Trilogy HD, re-release of some of those games

378
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,920

383
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,440
Eco and Shadow Colossus Collection on PlayStation 3 finally making its way out this week, definitely

384
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
a must-buy.

385
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:15,840
FIFA Soccer 12 on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PSP, Xbox 360, 3DS, and the Wii.

386
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,960
Of course, as I mentioned earlier, I believe the Wii is actually coming out later on.

387
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,160
It's not supposed to be this week, I believe it's next week.

388
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:29,680
Let's see here, Sulatorobo, Red the Hunter for Nintendo DS this week from XSeed.

Air Conflict Secret Wars on Xbox 360, Driver San Francisco on PC, Touch and Play Collection

Axis on the 3DS.

393
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,920
That's it for US, and then let's see here for Japan.

394
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,280
I've got a few things coming out this week.

395
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:08,040
Over there, Monster Hunter Frontier Online, the Forward 2 premier package coming out in

396
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,320
Japan on Xbox 360.

397
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,520
They also have a Monster Hunter console bundle over there, 250 gigabyte system, including

398
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,800
an online trial pack.

399
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:26,240
Game called Code 18 coming out over there in Japan, and looks like it may be another

400
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
dating sim.

401
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,720
That's from Cyber Front, yeah, definitely looks like a dating sim adventure game or

402
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,720
something like that.

403
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah, adventure game.

404
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,040
Let's see, moving on, also we've got the collector's edition for the Monster Hunter Frontier Online

405
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:52,440
Forward 2 premium package, and let's see, that's it for a 360.

406
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:59,800
Moving on down here to PlayStation 3, I believe.

407
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,880
We've got some weird games from Konami.

408
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,480
Formula One 2011 in Japan, they're getting their release over there for that game.

409
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,160
MLB Bobblehead, that's coming from Konami.

410
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:26,880
Let's see here, Shin Sengoku Musou 6, that's coming out both regular and a premium box

411
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,440
set as well.

412
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,000
That's it for PlayStation 3.

413
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,400
Next we've got, let's see here, nothing on the Vita yet, that would still be quite early

414
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
for the Vita.

415
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:54,400
PSP, a couple things on PSP, looks like Bullet Butlers coming out, Bullet Butlers from Boost

416
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,080
On, that's coming out in both regular and limited edition.

417
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,960
Also they're getting code 18 as well, regular and limited edition there.

418
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:10,600
Dead End Orchestra Maneuvers in the Dead End, that's a weird title, that's coming out as

419
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,680
well, regular and limited edition.

420
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,840
Lots of stuff this week, let's see.

421
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:30,240
Getting Iyu Densetsu Eo no Kiseki, that's both regular with a drama CD and limited edition

422
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
as well.

423
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,040
Evangelion Shin Genki Joban 3rd Impact.

424
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Oh great.

425
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:43,320
More Eva Games, the series that will not die.

426
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:50,280
Hakuisei Renee Shokoden, that's coming out as well.

427
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,160
Man, lots of games this week on the PSP, I'm surprised.

428
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,240
Holy crap, there's a ton of stuff.

429
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,040
Let's see, also Neon Genesis Evangelion 3rd Impact.

430
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:10,640
I'm assuming that's maybe a localized version, Asian version or something like that.

431
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:18,040
Secret Game Portable, Yeti Best, that's coming out as well.

432
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:27,240
And they're even doing a, I guess a branded memory stick duo or whatever for 3rd Impact.

433
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,080
They love their Evangelion over there.

434
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:41,440
And then finally, Wanda Fortune 2 and Tantei Buu Detective Club, that's coming out I guess

435
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
as well.

436
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:48,000
Lots of stuff on the PSP, which is kind of odd because in the US man, there's like maybe

437
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,960
three titles this year left and that's it.

438
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,600
And then on the Wii, not a whole lot, they're pretty much just getting that Biohazard Chronicles

439
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,840
value pack, which is the Umbrella Chronicles and Dark Side Chronicles set, the two gun

440
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,680
shooter games that they had, that's it for the Wii.

441
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:27,640
And let's see, 3DS, few things, Hanatu Ikomo no Ritai Zukan, no idea what that is, but

442
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,120
let's take a look here real quick.

443
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:37,000
No idea what that is, looks like it has a butterfly on the cover.

444
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,280
Maybe it's a bug collecting sim.

445
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:45,880
Yeah, it's a bug collecting game.

446
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,640
Bug collecting or maybe just photos or something, nature.

447
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,040
Bird feeding, you collect the bugs and feed the birds.

448
00:30:52,040 --> 00:31:00,840
I think it's something about photography because it's showing they have stuff for shooting

449
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:09,040
flowers and they've got a kind of like a collage, yeah it looks like just nature photos or something,

450
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,760
some sort of, I don't know, very niche.

451
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:22,520
And finally let's see Nintendo DS here, don't know if they've really got anything, oh actually

452
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,480
it's kind of neat, they've got some re-releases on Playstation 2, Grand Theft Auto 3, Rock

453
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,900
Stars Classic Edition, also San Andreas and Vice City Stories, all making their way out

454
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,200
as well.

455
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:47,040
Haru Kannaru Jinku no Kade 4, that's getting re-released as well.

456
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,400
And Nintendo DS, nothing in Japan right now.

457
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Nintendo doesn't love you Japan.

458
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,640
At least no DS's this week.

459
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:04,400
Well how about we hop over a couple more oceans and get to Europe, sound good?

460
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,920
In the UK, we have Stuff.

461
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:13,720
On the 27th, Resident Evil Code Veronica X for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, Ico and Shadow

462
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:21,960

463
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:28,640
The Binding of Isaac, Worms Ultimate Mayhem, Zelda Four Swords Anniversary Edition.

464
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,640
On the 29th we have Katamari Amore on the iPhone, and on the 30th we have Game of Thrones

465
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:45,240
Genesis, Child of Eden, Driver San Francisco, FIFA 12, We Sing UK Hits, and X-Men Destiny.

466
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,240
That's pretty much it.

467
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Alright.

468
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,920
You got anything else for us?

469
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,520
Yeah, we've got some stuff here.

470
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,840
Really, I think we should do the Classic Game of the Week.

471
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
Really?

472
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
Okay.

473
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
Well then let's go ahead and do the Classic Game of the Week.

474
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
As soon as I find the music.

475
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,360
Since we're like, you know, flipping things around here and it's a very short show, might

476
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,080
as well.

477
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:20,920
Well then let's go ahead and get right into it.

478
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,200
This is the Classic Game of the Week where I take you back in time in my TARDIS and show

479
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,960
you games that you should have been playing, but did you play them?

480
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,360
No, because you probably weren't born.

481
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,040
Damn kids.

482
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:41,920
Today's game is one called Quartet that anyone who actually is a fan of Project Diva might

483
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,520
recognize the game.

484
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,800
You know, Quartet came out in 1986 and it was an arcade game put out by Sega.

485
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,840
You could have one to four players lead your characters through a base taken over by an

486
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,080
army of robots.

487
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,040
And it was set in the Fantasy Zone.

488
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,080
As in Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier.

489
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,160
In fact, Dan was telling me that Sega had this whole thing where their set of games

490
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,720
back in the day were all set in the Fantasy Zone that they were going to say every one

491
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,960
of their games were set there, but that didn't quite catch on.

492
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,200
At any rate, you've got a character named Joe, Mary, Lee, or Edgar and you go through

493
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,400
side-scrolling levels and you have to advance through the level and fight opponents that

494
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,520
come out of portals in the walls and eventually defeat a boss that has the door case you can

495
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,520
go to the next level.

496
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,240
And you've got different power-ups like a jet pack and springs for jumping and boosting

497
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,160
and different kinds of fun like that.

498
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,440
So I'm going to go ahead and actually get the music playing since I didn't think about

499
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,440
that so you can hear what it's like.

500
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,920
I'm going to start it over so you can hear it from the beginning because this is actually

501
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,160
one of the best pieces of gaming music ever.

502
00:34:51,160 --> 00:35:13,880
If it will play.

503
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,560
This is from the Master System, so that's actually pretty good, but then again Master

504
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,200
System games really did have a lot of great music.

505
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:28,120
At any rate, you've got different weapon types, different orbs that will give you power-ups,

506
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,760
but if it's another player's color, then it just gives you bonus points.

507
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,680
And it came out around the same time as Gauntlet, sort of like I guess Sega's answer to Gauntlet.

508
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,440
But it did come out on the Master System, but you could only play as Mary or Edgar and

509
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,600
it was misspelled E-D-G-E-R.

510
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,960
So it came out in Japan as Double Target, but over here it still came out as Quartet.

511
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,440
There is also home versions.

512
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,720
There were Commodore 64, Amstrad, CPC, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum.

513
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,720
And the Okie Wrap and FM Funk music from the game were actually used later in the 1991

514
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,680
Spider-Man video game.

515
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:13,000
So Quartet 2 is an updated version that was done in a conversion kit that you could only

516
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,640
play two players in the arcade one, but you could still select your characters.

517
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,400
So that's the game of the week is Quartet.

518
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:28,280
Now, I was mentioning that fans of Project D.Va should be able to recognize this song

519
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,240
because a version of the song was used in Project D.Va 2nd.

520
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,000
I know it was in Project D.Va Arcade, so I was going to play a little bit of that for

521
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,160
you guys now, but if you stay tuned after this show, I'll play the whole thing.

522
00:36:42,160 --> 00:37:06,640
So here it goes.

523
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:35,320
And that was the version from Project D.Va.

524
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,960
Pretty cool, huh?

525
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Sure.

526
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
What next?

527
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,680
All right, let's move on along here.

528
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,040
We've got a few more stories left.

529
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,280
So let's see here.

530
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,680
Since we were talking a little bit about Project D.Va, and it kind of reminds me of actually

531
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,680
some of the Bahmani games, there's actually a new Bahmani, well, not technically a new

532
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,200
Bahmani game, but a new game to the arcades, I should say.

533
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,920
Dance Evolution, which was basically titled Dance Masters over here in the US, you may

534
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,240
remember it as kind of the Kinect dancing game from Konami, that didn't really sell

535
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,240
very well, but it was like Para, I guess.

536
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,840
But now it is making full circle and going to the arcades, where they have an actual

537
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:29,520
cabinet that's being location tested right now.

538
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:37,820
And I love the first licensed song, because it does kind of sum up everything.

539
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:47,520
So the first licensed song is Irony, Irony by Klarius, and a couple other Japanese songs,

540
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,440
one from AKB48 and Morning Musume.

541
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,960
And then of course, some of the Konami originals on the cabinet as well, Geisha's Dream by

542
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,660
Naoki featuring Smell Decay, Into Your Heart, The Roughage Remix, Naoki featuring Yasmin,

543
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:16,480
Keep on Movin' by NMR, Kimono Princess by Joon, My Summer Love by Mitsuo with Gala,

544
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:24,920
and let's see, Open Your Eyes, Naoki Maida, featuring JB, and Still in My Heart by Naoki,

545
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,440
and Unity by The Remembers.

546
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
That's fun.

547
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,840
We'd have to really do a lot of the upgrades to make it compete with just getting a home

548
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
version.

549
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,640
Well, it's basically, yeah, from the look of the cabinet, it's got a camera in there

550
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:48,880
as well, and they didn't really show any sort of actual game stage, it's just basically

551
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,840
the cabinet from the looks of it, and I'm thinking it's going to be very similar to

552
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,560
how the home game played, it's basically just kind of in front of a camera.

553
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,760
Unfortunately, they don't really have too much to go off of other than just a shot into

554
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,280
the cabinet, which looks like it's just got an HD screen.

555
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,720
They better have a lot of Eurobeat.

556
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,000
That kind of stuff in there.

557
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,520
Because honestly, that game just lends itself to Eurobeat.

558
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,160
Yeah, I mean, looking at the screenshots, it looks just like a straight port of the

559
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,200
game, so yeah, interesting I guess.

560
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,480
I mean, I'd play it, and again, I like Dance Masters.

561
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:35,520
I don't know if I would, but I just, it lacked some stuff as far as cues on what the hell

562
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,520
to do.

563
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,400
But I mean, if you're used to playing Para, I guess it's not too different, well, especially

564
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,780
not too different if you're playing certain songs in the game, because the Para routines

565
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,320
are basically the routines from the game.

566
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,320
So yeah, I don't know.

567
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,600
Well, that's still pretty neat.

568
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,980
But I actually really want to see a machine before I pass judgment on it.

569
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,040
So maybe we'll get one over here eventually.

570
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,040
And in other news, now there is a game that I have mentioned to everybody before that's

571
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,180
called Snatcher.

572
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:12,880
And there was a radio drama called Dature, S-D-A-T-H-E-R, and the first two episodes

573
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,020
of it have been translated.

574
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,140
So that's actually pretty cool.

575
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:23,700
And I will link that to the chat room so that anyone who is a Snatcher fan will be able

576
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,520
to see it.

577
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,800
I would actually just like for them to do another update of the game so I can play it

578
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
again.

579
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,520
Oh, maybe as soon as he finishes all the other damn projects he has on deck, like the Metal

580
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:45,240
Gear Solid 3D game for 3DS that's still not out yet, or, oh, I don't know, the Metal Gear

581
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,920
Rising game that's...

582
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,520
I don't even know where the hell it happened with that game, I mean, it's maybe the end

583
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,520
of the next year.

584
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,960
And then of course he has his new Fox engine that he's working on games for, so it could

585
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,120
be a while.

586
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:09,160
Well, I would very much like to, see, that's the problem with talented people that get

587
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:14,200
too much on their plate, is they don't get the right stuff on their plate, at least to

588
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
come out anyway.

589
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,080
Yes, I agree, Zeether, Snatcher kicks ass.

590
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:24,800
I've actually got Snatcher for PS1, but of course it's all in Japanese, and my husband

591
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
lost patience with it really quickly.

592
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,560
But who knows.

593
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,220
So let's go ahead and open up Ye Olde Skypline, I will change this to online.

594
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:46,500
You can give us a call, our number is 1-866-877-GAME-OLR, and you will be live on air and we can embarrass

595
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,840
the crap out of you.

596
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,560
Ooh!

597
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
Are you afraid?

598
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:59,800
While we're waiting for calls to come in, just gonna read a couple other things, a third

599
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,120
round of songs have been announced for D&D Revolution 2, in case you're interested in

600
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:08,200
picking up the Wii version, I'm glad to see that DM Ashura is still getting work, he has

601
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:15,680
a song in there called Aftershock, also of course Kay with Dirty Digital, Dummy by Ram,

602
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:26,340
In Love With You, Kotaru featuring Aya, Sakura Storm by Ryu Star, also Delta Max by DM Ashura

603
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,680
as well.

604
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:35,320
It's really funny seeing all the old Bomani, DWI, step mania artists getting songs into

605
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,960
these games nowadays.

606
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
He said DWI.

607
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:46,440
Yeah, fans with intensity stuff, it's old school, John's not old school.

608
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,080
Well looks like no one's, oh we just got a caller, so I will go ahead and pick this up.

609
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,360
Hello, you've reached OLR, who's this?

610
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,640
Hi, it's CD Thunder.

611
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,280
Hello CD Thunder, and a happy belated birthday to you.

612
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
Thank you very much.

613
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,360
Welcome, so what's up, what's on your mind?

614
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,920
Not too much, just have a couple things to discuss.

615
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,480
Okay.

616
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,200
First thing is, I'd like to talk about one of my favorite video game characters of all

617
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
time.

618
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
And who is that?

619
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,200
Mario.

620
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,200
Oh.

621
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,920
So why is Mario your favorite?

622
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,920
It's one of my favorites.

623
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,240
One of your favorites, okay.

624
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,760
So what do you want to say about Mario?

625
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,840
Well the reason I like Mario is because I really like his outfit.

626
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:43,920
I love his hat and everything he can do with the fire flowers and all that stuff.

627
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,760
Is the fire flower your favorite power up for him?

628
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,160
For me it's the tanooki suit.

629
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,080
It would be the fire flower and that feather that gives him the cape.

630
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,080
Yeah.

631
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,800
I'm actually really a fan of Pull's boot, not Pull's voice, I'm thinking of the little

632
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,800
boot thing.

633
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,800
The kuberu shoe.

634
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,800
Kuberu, thank you.

635
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,480
I don't think I've seen that before, actually.

636
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,680
That's in Super Mario Brothers 3.

637
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,680
Oh.

638
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,200
Well, I, yeah, I mean, I haven't played many of the games.

639
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:23,840
I mean, I play like Super Mario, the new Super Mario Brothers for the DS and a lot of others,

640
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:29,120
but I just like everything about him.

641
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,360
That's cool.

642
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,800
So you said there were a couple of things you wanted to talk about, what was the other?

643
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,800
The other one is, I want to talk about prototype.

644
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,800
Prototype, okay.

645
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,560
What I like about that is you're a guy who's basically a human weapon.

646
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,800
You can do pretty much everything.

647
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,440
So like, you could blow up the earth if you wanted to?

648
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,360
What did you say?

649
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,520
You could blow up the earth if you wanted to?

650
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,880
Well, maybe, but I like how you can, what is it called?

651
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,440
You can, yeah, you consume other people and you can actually turn them to them if you

652
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,560
need to, to sneak around places.

653
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,320
That sounds like episodes of Supernatural.

654
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,800
Now are you looking forward to the sequel coming out next year?

655
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,520
Prototype 2?

656
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:26,040
I haven't actually seen anything about that, so I'm not sure what I feel on that yet.

657
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:32,320
And what you basically do with your character is a lot of free running, the parkour stuff,

658
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:38,080
because you can run up the walls and do flips and all that type of thing.

659
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,080
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

660
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,080
I didn't ever play it.

661
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,080
Oh really?

662
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,080
Yeah.

663
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,080
I wasn't too busy playing WoW.

664
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,080
Addicts?

665
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:51,560
Rob's my dealer and I can't yell at him.

666
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,720
I just wanted to see what you guys thought of Mario.

667
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,320
What are your opinions on him?

668
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,320
Iconic.

669
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,360
That's all I can say.

670
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,720
That's a good character, I guess.

671
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,720
Good franchise for Nintendo.

672
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:13,240
Well, yeah, that was pretty much all I wanted to call in about.

673
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,360
And yeah, birthday was yesterday and I turned 19.

674
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,360
Party time!

675
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,360
Happy birthday!

676
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,120
You're only two years away from the big party.

677
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,520
Yeah, I know.

678
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,520
It's scary.

679
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,520
Well, you have a good one.

680
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,520
Thanks for calling in.

681
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,520
Uh huh.

682
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
Bye.

683
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,520
Bye bye.

684
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,240
So, any other callers want to give us a call?

685
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:38,120
You can call us at 877-GAME-OLR or reach us on Skype or Orange Lounge Radio.

686
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,120
Please call.

687
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,520
While we're waiting for more calls here.

688
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:48,200
Kind of neat, Assassin's Creed, one of those games now that they're going to be adding

689
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,560
more content to the Playstation 3 version in the form of an older game.

690
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,600
Kind of like how Bioshock Infinite's going to have the original Bioshock in there.

691
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,800
Assassin's Creed Revelations is going to have the original Assassin's Creed on the same

692
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,520
disc because, you know, hey, the game doesn't use up all the blu-ray space and they can

693
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,520
do that.

694
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,520
And unfortunately they haven't really done anything to the original game as far as adding

695
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,000
trophy support or anything like that, but hey, you get another game in case, you know,

696
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,200
maybe you don't have the first Assassin's Creed.

697
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,200
I don't know.

698
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,080
Neat, I guess.

699
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:25,200
Also, I was going to mention Final Fantasy XIV is actually getting some updates.

700
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,200
We have a call.

701
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
Can we hold that one for after?

702
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,200
Sure.

703
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
Okay.

704
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,200
Hello, thank you for calling Orange Lounge Radio.

705
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,200
Who is this?

706
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,200
This is Kaijuto.

707
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,200
Can you hear me?

708
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
Yes, we can.

709
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,200
Hi, Kaijuto.

710
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Long time no talk.

711
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,200
Hey, what's up?

712
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,200
This is what I was thinking.

713
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,920
Really don't know what to talk about, but your last caller, he was talking about Mario

714
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,720
and it made me think about something.

715
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,640
Why the hell doesn't Mario have a kid yet?

716
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,640
Like how old is he by now?

717
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,640
About 40, 50?

718
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:54,720
Yeah, but they say that sometimes obesity affects fertility.

719
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,960
Ah.

720
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,040
God maybe he seems to be a very well, maybe fungus people and humans aren't compatible.

721
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,480
Yeah, maybe so.

722
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,480
Yeah, I forgot that Princess Peach isn't necessarily from this dimension.

723
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:15,920
Either that or she's produced spores, but they mutated and turned into goombas.

724
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,480
And I don't know, I guess the next thing I'll talk about is games I'm looking forward to.

725
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,760
I've been going over my game list, like what I plan on buying, and I just realized that

726
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,400
I don't think I'm buying anything for the Xbox 360 for the rest of this year.

727
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,400
Really?

728
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,600
Yeah, I think everything that I'm buying is basically going to be for PlayStation 3.

729
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:40,720
Battlefield 3, I'm getting for PlayStation 3 just because it's like single disc and your

730
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,440
promise there's...

731
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,400
Uh oh, sorry.

732
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,400
Give us a call back, sorry.

733
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,400
Alright.

734
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,520
What was that?

735
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,000
Definitely picked up a call by accident, so my bad.

736
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Okay.

737
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,800
I'm going to try to call, um, ah.

738
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,680
Yeah, this is ghetto ass broken radio.

739
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,640
Sorry, I didn't mean, I called you again by accident, we're going to have Rob edit this

740
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,640
out.

741
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,960
I will call you back as soon as this call is over.

742
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,960
How's that?

743
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,960
Alright.

744
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,960
Okay, thank you.

745
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:24,800
Okay, now I'm trying to figure out how to accept the call again.

746
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,800
Resume call.

747
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,800
Hi, sorry.

748
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,800
Are you, are you there?

749
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,800
Do you have me here?

750
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,800
Do you hear me?

751
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,800
I'm so sorry.

752
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:39,520
Um, I, we got another caller pop up and accidentally hit the answer button so it put you on hold.

753
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,520
Yeah.

754
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,520
No problem.

755
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,560
So, my apologies, I'm normally not the one that handles the Skype line as you can tell.

756
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,400
Yeah, I'm getting like double talk now.

757
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,400
Oh, fun.

758
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,400
Well.

759
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Oh, wait a second.

760
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,400
Alright, there it is.

761
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,400
Okay.

762
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,400
I turned down, turned down my computer.

763
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,400
That would help.

764
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,400
Yeah.

765
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,400
So, I'm sorry, what were you saying?

766
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,320
Anyway, yes, so I mean, every game that I'm getting is pretty much going to be for PS3,

767
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,360
I just realized that, so.

768
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,160
I don't know, I don't think I'm the only one.

769
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,560
I think maybe, ah, 2012 is going to be the year of PS3 maybe.

770
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,240
Well, it seems like it's about time they did something right, huh?

771
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,240
Yeah.

772
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,240
It's about time.

773
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,640
Well, you know, it's like we said, the system's only as good as the games that are on it.

774
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,640
Yeah, that's true.

775
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,640
Yep.

776
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,640
Yep.

777
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,640
Alrighty.

778
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,640
Well.

779
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,640
Goodnight.

780
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,640
Alright, sorry for the mix-up.

781
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,640
Yeah, it's no problem.

782
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,640
Okay, buh-bye.

783
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:34,720
Okay, now, um, I will try to get a hold of Zither again, who was calling and I was being

784
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,720
a derp.

785
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,200
Hello, Zither, are you there?

786
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,640
Hi, it's Zither from the chat.

787
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,640
Hello.

788
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:49,000
Um, I was thinking of something to call about and I finally thought of something, um, you've

789
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,800
heard of Retro Game Challenge, right?

790
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
The DS game?

791
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,800
Yeah.

792
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:59,600
The, um, I've been watching the show that it's based on, Game Center CX, and it is awesome.

793
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,560
It is just one of the best things I've ever watched, one of the best Japanese television

794
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,560
shows I have ever watched.

795
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,760
So what do you like about it?

796
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,360
Um, it's really fun to watch because it has this guy struggling to get through the games

797
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:17,840
to get to the end and it's just, it's just cool watching him constantly try to make it

798
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:24,320
through and spending out these hours planning things out and getting through it.

799
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,320
That sounds pretty cool.

800
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,240
So it's just, you like the struggle.

801
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,640
Yeah, it's, it's very, they make it like overly dramatic sometimes.

802
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,000
Like, he'll be at like this impasse and they'll be like, and they'll be like, oh, how is he

803
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
going to get through this?

804
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,640
Is he going to be able to beat this enemy that's giving him trouble?

805
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:45,160
Like in one episode he was doing ghosts and goblins and the red demon was constantly giving

806
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,400
him hell and it was like, how is he going to get past this guy?

807
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,280
He's stuck in game over hell.

808
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,760
Oh, that I can imagine too, because like that last level is especially crappy with the red

809
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,760
demon.

810
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,760
Oh yeah.

811
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,440
And when he found out he had to do it all over again, he was like, I'm not going to

812
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,440
do this.

813
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,940
I'm going to just hand it over to one of the other guys.

814
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:04,940
He's going to do it.

815
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,940
It's.

816
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:06,940
Oh yeah.

817
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,720
He's going to beat the game and then it's like, no, go back.

818
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,840
No, you have to do it again.

819
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,880
That was, that game was like one of the ultimate in rage quits.

820
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,860
Yeah, it's definitely.

821
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:21,460
And um, he actually, I actually found out that the guy who was on, the guy who did,

822
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:25,840
the guy on the show who does the games, playing the games, his name is Arino.

823
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:31,840
He was actually in um, California at one point that like a couple of weeks ago he was doing

824
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:38,940
a special tape special that was going to be him going to the U S and, and a lot of people

825
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,080
showed up.

826
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,600
That's pretty cool.

827
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,600
Yeah.

828
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,900
The retro game challenge game is also extremely fun.

829
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,000
It's definitely one of my favorite DS games.

830
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,840
I might have to check that out given, you know, my husband and I are like the huge game,

831
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,200
old school game people.

832
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,240
It's very good.

833
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,280
It's got some, it's got some really, really good games in it.

834
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,980
The sequel didn't come out here, but there's actually a group that's working on a fan translation

835
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,980
for it.

836
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,720
And so far from what I can tell, it looks pretty close to what we got here for the first

837
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,720
game.

838
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,720
That sounds awesome.

839
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,080
Yeah.

840
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,520
And uh, yeah, Snatcher, really good game.

841
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,000
Snatcher is fantastic.

842
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,360
I've still been trying to find a Sega CD copy.

843
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,600
Oh yeah, it's really hard to find it.

844
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,760
I've just had to emulate, but it's, it's really good.

845
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,960
I, I really like it.

846
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,960
The plot is great.

847
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,800
I still, I need to get back to it because I've gotten pretty far into the, pretty decently

848
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,200
far into the game, but it's really good.

849
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,200
I like the music.

850
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,480
I like the voice, the voice acting.

851
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,280
It's very, very well done for a game that's from like the early nineties.

852
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,920
The little Metal Gear cameo.

853
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,440
Yes, Metal Gear walking around.

854
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:52,640
I especially liked, um, the club, the Outer Heaven Club and when you were, when you went

855
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,000
there, you got to pick a mask and I picked the Moai head and there was all the Konami

856
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
characters there and, um, who was it, um, Gillian was like, I don't know if we fit in

857
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,520
and Metal Gear is like, I think we fit in more than you think.

858
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,960
And I kind of caught that subtle Gradius reference.

859
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,400
Very, very cool.

860
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,000
Yeah, that's super neat.

861
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,560
Well, pretty cool.

862
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,040
So you got anything else for us?

863
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,200
No, nothing else.

864
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,200
All right.

865
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,120
Well, I'm sorry that I hung up on you earlier.

866
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,120
It's all right.

867
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,440
I attribute that to derp because it's the derpisode.

868
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,160
It's mad buggy.

869
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,480
Bug report.

870
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,480
All right.

871
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,480
All right.

872
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,480
Later.

873
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,480
Later.

874
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,480
All right guys.

875
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,480
You can give us a call.

876
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,800
We'll take one more call.

877
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,440
It's a eight seven seven game O L R. Do you have any other last minute stories for us?

878
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Yeah.

879
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,440
I was going to finish up real quick.

880
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,440
Yeah, that's right.

881
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,440
The yeah.

882
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,440
Yeah.

883
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,440
Final Fantasy 14, you know, they didn't really fix the game yet all the way, but they did

884
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:54,020
add chocobos and uh, you can get a three, they have three different chocobos stables

885
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:59,400
in the game, um, which you can eat your very own chocobo whistle and you can ride chocobos

886
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,140
pretty much anywhere in the game.

887
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:06,720
Also they have added materia so you can add materia and augment your weapons as well.

888
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:12,920
And then finally airships, um, have been added into the game as well so that you can actually

889
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,480
ride across everything.

890
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,480
I don't know.

891
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,480
It's just really, you didn't have chocobos or airships in this game.

892
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,280
I mean you had it in 11.

893
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,960
Why is, should this be any different considering that you're reusing everything anyways?

894
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,280
Well, we got another call in.

895
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,640
This is the last call of the night.

896
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,640
Hello.

897
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,640
You have reached orange launch radio.

898
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,640
Who is this?

899
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,480
Yo, it's Xenocore from the LKC.

900
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,480
How y'all doing?

901
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,480
Doing good.

902
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,480
How are you Xenocore?

903
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,760
Uh, well rested from my trip.

904
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,280
I think you might've heard a bit when I spoke on Bobby, but yeah, driving to Florida and

905
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,000
back is no fun.

906
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,520
Uh, that doesn't sound like fun at all.

907
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,520
Yeah.

908
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,680
Especially when it's just for family duties, not a real vacation, but anyway, we're here

909
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,680
about games.

910
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,680
Yep.

911
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,680
So what is up?

912
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,080
Uh, not much.

913
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:02,360
I did want to include a small thing, uh, on top of, you know, uh, Arino playing old school

914
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,840
games on Game Center CX.

915
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,160
He also does do interviews with some of the game makers in Japan.

916
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,160
He's already talked to the guys in charge of Castlevania.

917
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,720
He talked to Kojima about Metal Gear and its history and other things like that.

918
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,660
There's a lot of stuff that, like for instance, Kotaku is covering the gaming that he's doing

919
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,640
and doing some awful voiceover on some of the stuff.

920
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:27,280
But there's an account on, uh, YouTube that somebody has been putting all the fan subs

921
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,360
that have been done online.

922
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,440
And I put a link to one of them in chat, but, uh, they've got over 24 of the episodes already,

923
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,400
including the one where he went to Korea and talked to some gamers over there as well.

924
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,860
It is really an outstanding show.

925
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,900
I'm going to have to check that out as, I mean, it sounds like something totally up

926
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,900
my alley.

927
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,640
I just had never, I mean, I've heard of it before, but I haven't ever seen any.

928
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,640
Yeah.

929
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,840
Right around 903 in chat, if you take that link, that'll give you the account name.

930
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,400
I think it's like active circle or something like that, but he's putting all that stuff

931
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,400
on there.

932
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
You can give it a go.

933
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:07,600
And, uh, the other thing, um, I'm still curious as to whether or not I should, as much as

934
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:13,400
I love Space Marine, I've heard rumors that the multiplayer population has already died

935
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,400
out.

936
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Really?

937
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,400
It's kind of sucks.

938
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,720
I'm not sure if that's accurate or not.

939
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,960
I mean, it's probably just fanboys complaining, but I hope not because that game was awesome

940
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,400
and I, I played it from game fly.

941
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,920
I do want to get a full version of it, but I'm not going to do it if the multiplayer

942
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,920
isn't there.

943
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,200
Cause that's the only thing that's left in there for me.

944
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Yeah.

945
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,200
Well, I mean, if the game doesn't give you what you want, what's the point, right?

946
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,560
Well, it gave me everything I wanted, but it was a multi, the single player, you know,

947
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,040
once you go through that, you pretty much know it as fun as it is.

948
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,800
I'm not the kind of guy that can just do that repeatedly and get enjoyment out of it.

949
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,800
So yeah.

950
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:50,360
But, uh, I hope, I hope they make another one cause that was an outstanding representation

951
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,880
of what to do with that franchise.

952
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,240
So they can keep her fingers crossed, right?

953
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,240
Mm hmm.

954
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,240
Offer a little prayer.

955
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,240
Yup.

956
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,240
Yup.

957
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,880
But, uh, awesome job today, guys, uh, sky isn't missing the thing.

958
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,880
So good job.

959
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,420
He actually just texted that he made it to San Francisco and I was going to reply that

960
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,000
I'm hateful and jealous, but nah, that's okay.

961
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,920
He has to stay in there and the audience with the rest of the granted lady Tron's playing,

962
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,020
but he's going to get, you know, funk right all over him.

963
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:21,880
So you know, yeah, he's going to come back smelling like pot and then he's going to get

964
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,880
sick.

965
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,880
No, I'm kidding.

966
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,880
All right.

967
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,880
Well thank you for calling.

968
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,880
Did you have anything else?

969
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,880
No, that's pretty much it.

970
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,880
Pretty light today.

971
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,880
So alrighty.

972
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,880
Well you take care and we will hear from you next week maybe.

973
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:36,300
Oh, hopefully next week we actually have a special guest on the show.

974
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,300
Another host.

975
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,300
It's Dan.

976
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,300
So I guess he's not that special.

977
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,700
I mean he's special, special to me.

978
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,280
Just a little bit special.

979
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,280
Just special.

980
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,280
Okay.

981
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,280
Bye bye.

982
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,280
All right.

983
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,280
Later.

984
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,280
All right.

985
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,560
That was our last call of the night and sorry anyone else who was trying to get in because

986
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:56,800
believe it or not, we did have people trying to get in, but nope, that was it.

987
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,680
And I actually do have another story.

988
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:08,480
Just a little story that came to us courtesy, courtesy, courtesy of a tiger claw and that's

989
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:14,180
that Microsoft is allowing a small number of mistakenly banned Xbox 360 players back

990
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,360
on Xbox Live.

991
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:23,140
So they actually, Steven Toulouse wrote a blog about that some of the suspensions were

992
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:27,360
mistakenly made by different software being used and so they are bringing those people

993
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:31,560
back there and banning them and will give them a free three month subscription to Xbox

994
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,600
Live Gold and 1600 Microsoft Points.

995
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:40,160
And they said it was very specific issue and it happened between August 29th and September

996
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,160
9th.

997
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,120
So they've got it lined up.

998
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:49,280
So I guess that's nice of them saying, oh, we screwed up here.

999
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,760
Do you have anything else for us?

1000
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,080
Just one thing real quick and it's more of a PSA than anything.

1001
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,080
All right.

1002
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:03,340
Remember we talked, well, I talked about the Tommy Wee Show that I guess is something that's

1003
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:09,040
running from Makima on YouTube and stuff like that.

1004
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:16,780
Well, they had the first episode featuring Tommy with so and it is fucking stupid.

1005
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:20,440
First off, it's a rip off of Mr. Science Theory 3000.

1006
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:27,000
Secondly, Tommy with so cannot form English sentences.

1007
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,280
He's just, it's just so fucking stupid.

1008
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,880
And the only humor that you'd find in this is that he's really stupid.

1009
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,880
So I mean, if you like watching stupid people play games, I'm sure there's plenty of videos

1010
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:46,920
out there on the Internet of people playing games, but it is seriously a rip off of Mr.

1011
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,520
Science Theory 3000 straight up to the set, to the logo, to everything.

1012
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,520
Wow.

1013
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,520
That's just.

1014
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,260
And it's not even to the fact that he's mocking a game being played.

1015
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:02,960
It's him playing a game while this alien's mocking him.

1016
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,280
And I mean, at one point he accidentally hits the PlayStation button and it goes to the

1017
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,720
cross menu bar and he's just, how do I get out of this?

1018
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,160
I mean, it's dumb, so please don't watch it.

1019
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,440
Just let it die in a fire.

1020
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,440
Lame.

1021
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:25,600
Well, that's it for OLR, but I'm actually going to go ahead and play, um, oh, actually,

1022
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,600
you know what?

1023
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,600
So never mind.

1024
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,840
I'm not going to play anything, but I'm going to give everyone a little bitty tip.

1025
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:36,840
Stay tuned after the show and you will hear a blast from the past in the form of a modified

1026
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,360
pump up the volume.

1027
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,960
So, uh, do you have any final thoughts?

1028
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,960
Uh, no.

1029
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,960
Yeah.

1030
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,880
I don't have any either except that I'm just going to do some music for about an hour so

1031
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,120
that you guys don't feel like we've gone, oh, don't want to.

1032
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,120
Okay.

1033
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,120
So anyway, thank you for listening.
