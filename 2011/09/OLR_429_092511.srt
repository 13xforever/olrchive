1
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:15,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't listen to this part.

2
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:16,139
[SPEAKER_03]: It's lies.

3
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:16,760
[SPEAKER_03]: It was last week.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo reveals the future of the 3DS and it's pink.

5
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:22,643
[SPEAKER_03]: The PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch.

6
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:26,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sony adds a controversial new section to the PSN Terms of Service.

7
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:30,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:38,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello and welcome to episode 429 of this derpisode of Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:43,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I am your hostess of the evening, DarkSakura, and with me always is our techmaster, Loki.

10
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:53,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this is take two because someone was forgetting to start recording because someone's very jealous that Rob's off seeing Lady Tron tonight in San Francisco.

11
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:57,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, what are we?

12
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:05,567
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice, be it digitized or if we're saying it for you or whatever.

13
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:19,663
[SPEAKER_06]: So over the next few hours we will be talking about game stuff and we tape live every week on allgamesradio.com and that starts at 6 o'clock pacific time right after the Bobby Blackwell show and if you're listening to us live get in our chat room.

14
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:24,167
[SPEAKER_06]: It's chat.orangeradio.com and we are on Game Surge server.

15
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:26,950
[SPEAKER_06]: So Loki, again, how was Earth Defense Force?

16
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:28,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

17
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:49,500
[SPEAKER_07]: But thankfully you do get up to six players, which is kind of cool.

18
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Although we didn't get to play very long because our internet connection at work is kind of sketchy.

19
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:56,263
[SPEAKER_07]: It drops us every now and then.

20
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,585
[SPEAKER_07]: More often than every now and then.

21
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:01,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty often, actually.

22
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:06,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then, you know, Grand Theft Auto is the usual Grand Theft Auto stuff.

23
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:09,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, still trying to keep my winning streak going.

24
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:13,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, what else did I try?

25
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:20,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, it wasn't really game related, but I did mess around with the, um, Xbox Marketplace a little bit.

26
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:24,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, watched, my wife wanted to watch an episode of Up All Night.

27
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:27,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, so we watched that real quick and actually worked out pretty good.

28
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:30,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Never really used the Zoom Marketplace before, so that's kind of neat.

29
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:37,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also got to check out, well, I browsed and buy, some of the Xbox Live Indie games.

30
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:39,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And man, there's some weird shit on there.

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know.

32
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:44,303
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a game I saw that was about prank calling people.

33
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:48,746
[SPEAKER_07]: There was The Babymaker Extreme 2, I know, and we've talked about that before.

34
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:50,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks hilarious.

35
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't pick it up, though, but...

36
00:02:53,209 --> 00:03:22,448
[SPEAKER_07]: just a lot of stuff that's on there that's not great but it is kind of hard to navigate everything so hopefully they fix that and maybe with one of these updates maybe the next fall dashboard update will fix the store a little bit so it's easier to find stuff I think that's really all that I've played maybe a little bit more Zelda I don't remember if I actually played that or not this week but yeah that's about it I played WoW that's it

37
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're consistent.

38
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:50,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

39
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:17,345
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, the Old Republic will be shipping on December 20th and of course they do have some details on what it's going to cost you.

40
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:20,306
[SPEAKER_07]: They have different subscription packages.

41
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,786
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go month to month which is $14.99.

42
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:28,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course each game does come with a 30 day subscription that runs out and after 30 days you have to pay for it.

43
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:52,454
[SPEAKER_07]: if you choose to pay for some of your months in a lump sum you will save a little bit of money 3 months at a time will break it down to $13.99 a month and then 6 months at a time $12.99 a month so if you're dedicated to playing this game for a long time maybe the lump sums are the way to go you know what?

44
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:59,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the opportunity to get a lifetime membership for Star Trek Online and now I'm very glad I didn't because it's going free to play yeah

45
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I would advise everyone to hold off.

46
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:11,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, lifetime memberships, yeah, you might hold off on that because you never know the life cycle of these games nowadays that a lot of them are going free to play, but six months isn't bad.

47
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I imagine that Star Wars game is going to be around for at least six months.

48
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, who knows?

49
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:24,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I quit playing, well, no, that was February of, no, I started playing in February.

50
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:26,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I quit actually a year ago.

51
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:28,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek Online, this month.

52
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:29,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

53
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, in two months, sorry.

54
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:36,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, but yeah, I'd say though, six months is fine, but if they offer any type of lifetime thing, don't do it.

55
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:37,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do it.

56
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:40,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even if they give you a lightsaber that works.

57
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe that's worth it.

58
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:51,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in other news, we have something about Sega of Europe.

59
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:54,666
[SPEAKER_06]: John Smedley is saying they're a free-to-play model for DC.

60
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:55,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony.

61
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:55,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony?

62
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony Entertainment.

63
00:05:57,447 --> 00:05:58,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I said Sony.

64
00:05:58,388 --> 00:05:59,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Online Entertainment.

65
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:00,148
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

66
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:01,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm derp.

67
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:03,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still mad at Rob.

68
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:04,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still mad at Rob.

69
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:06,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really mad at Rob.

70
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:08,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

71
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:14,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony Online Entertainment has a free-to-play model for DC Universe Online.

72
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:18,711
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be three membership levels.

73
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:20,453
[SPEAKER_06]: There's free, premium, and legendary.

74
00:06:21,273 --> 00:06:26,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have full access to the game that has different levels of flexibility.

75
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:35,804
[SPEAKER_06]: So free players will have two character slots, and you downloadable game packs and updates, additional character slots you can pay for them.

76
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:38,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I refuse to use the term microtransaction.

77
00:06:38,926 --> 00:06:42,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Premium, so that's going to be people who have spent at least $5 on the game.

78
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,909
[SPEAKER_06]: That's including former subscribers and in-game item purchasers.

79
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:49,031
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have additional character slots, inventory slots, and higher cash limits.

80
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:53,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Legendary will have the maximum, including free DLC.

81
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:57,775
[SPEAKER_06]: More than 15 character slots and more than 80 inventory slots for $15 a month.

82
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:02,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is happening really soon, as in next week.

83
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:02,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

84
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:05,198
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means I can play the game.

85
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:08,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I will be trying it out, but honestly I'm glad I didn't pay for it.

86
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:28,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think a lot of these MMOs should go free-to-play.

87
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:32,311
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you, if Final Fantasy XI ever goes free-to-play, God, I don't know.

88
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:34,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I may have to get back into that.

89
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:37,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Nelly will wonder what happened to you.

90
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:50,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, it's not that big of a deal, because really the whole thing is I couldn't see myself paying, I think it was $13 a month or something like that for Final Fantasy XI, but I was only playing it maybe one evening a month.

91
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:52,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't see myself...

92
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

93
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:20,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Some more information going along the lines with, it's not really an MMO, but maybe the reason why the Old Republic did announce to be shipping this year.

94
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Diablo 3 is actually going to launch early 2012.

95
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:24,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to make it out this year, unfortunately.

96
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:33,894
[SPEAKER_07]: They did mention that they're going to extend the beta period, of course, since obviously the game's going to be coming out later on.

97
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:34,134
[SPEAKER_07]: They have

98
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:38,055
[SPEAKER_07]: More time to test it and hopefully get any kinks out of it.

99
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:46,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they're saying, while the news may not be a complete surprise, I know many of you were hopeful that Diablo 3 would ship this year.

100
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,477
[SPEAKER_07]: We were too.

101
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:57,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, ultimately, we felt to deliver an awesome Diablo sequel that lives up to our expectations and yours as well.

102
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,200
[SPEAKER_07]: We should take a little more time to add further polish to a few different elements of the game.

103
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in other words, it was buggy and they needed to fix it.

104
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:05,004
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's fine.

105
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:05,864
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is new?

106
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:08,607
[SPEAKER_07]: There's too much stuff coming out this year, anyway.

107
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:22,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've just... They actually were starting to put out little warnings on World of Warcraft, by the way, that if someone messages you saying, oh, you've got the Diablo 3 pass here, give us your password, blah, blah, blah.

108
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:24,503
[SPEAKER_06]: If you give anyone your password, you're stupid.

109
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

110
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:25,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

111
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:30,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Diablo III Diablo III Diablo III Diablo III

112
00:09:46,360 --> 00:10:02,741
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever well anyway so let's move forward into other news shall we shall speaking of Blizzard they are talking about patch 4.3 which everyone has been all abuzz about in game you know we get transmogrifying that means you can make your new shit look like old shit

113
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:04,803
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

114
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:24,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?

115
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:30,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, in the Firelands, the first boss has a dog with him named Rageface, but everyone calls him Rapeface.

116
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,931
[SPEAKER_06]: His attack is called Face Rage.

117
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:35,791
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just call it Face Rape.

118
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:36,591
That's awesome.

119
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:37,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

120
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:41,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Deathwing's just not sitting around.

121
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:47,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Because before, all he was doing was showing up in areas and burning people to death if they were on the ground and not in the air.

122
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:50,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me, it took forever to get that stupid achievement.

123
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,693
[SPEAKER_06]: So, he's going to be a raid.

124
00:10:54,713 --> 00:11:00,379
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually have to go into the future, go into the past, and the whole thing is going to end on the dragon's back.

125
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:06,726
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you have to pull off pieces of his plate armor as he's spinning down into the maelstrom.

126
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:11,471
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, get all stabby on him and maybe try to kill him.

127
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least, you know, make him really pissed off at you.

128
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:19,705
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be really, really huge.

129
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:27,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was reading some of the technical development behind it and they said that they've had to really pull some technical strings to get it to work.

130
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:30,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to seeing it, although honestly right now it's going to be forever.

131
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:31,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

132
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:48,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's it.

133
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:48,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

134
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:36,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course, like I said, the Deathwing Smackdown This is kind of interesting, there was a story on Rock Paper Shocking this week Talking about, you know how there's a lot of these folding projects The folding at home is a really popular one Well there was one, I guess it was a little bit newer, called Foldit

135
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:45,774
[SPEAKER_07]: And what Foldit is, is it's not just, you know, folding with your actual system or PC or whatever that you're using.

136
00:12:46,114 --> 00:12:48,916
[SPEAKER_07]: It does require some human interaction as well.

137
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:52,819
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of use, think of it like mind folding, I guess.

138
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:01,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, they were using this to kind of figure out how viruses like the AIDS virus worked and stuff like that.

139
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:05,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Also cancer and Alzheimer's as well.

140
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:32,130
[SPEAKER_07]: and I guess these are related to proteins and what the project does is I guess basically it's spatial recognition or something where players will I'm not really sure what you do but apparently it has something to do with matching stuff and based on your results and what they have in here they have I guess figured out how these actually work now so

141
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:33,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

142
00:13:50,927 --> 00:14:03,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Foldit players leverage human three-dimensional problem-solving skills to interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction mythology.

143
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:12,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Players collaborate with teammates while competing with other players to obtain the highest score, lowest energy models, and proof-of-concept tests.

144
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Foldit players most of

145
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:30,088
[SPEAKER_07]: who have little or no background in biochemistry were able to solve protein structure refinement problems in which backbone rearrangement was necessary to correctly bury hydrophobic residues.

146
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:34,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we report folded player successes in real world...

147
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:45,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Real-world modeling problems with complex deviations from native structures leading to the solution of a long-standing protein crystal structure problem.

148
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:54,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said basically, yeah, this is going to possibly lead to a cure for this stuff.

149
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty amazing.

150
00:14:56,943 --> 00:15:02,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems to me like in some cases education might get in the way of intuition, don't you think?

151
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

152
00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:10,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people have a natural aptitude towards solving puzzles as long as you give it to them in a term that they're going to understand it.

153
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:29,877
[SPEAKER_07]: The critical role of folded players in the solution of the M-PMV PR structure shows the power of online games to channel human intuition and three-dimensional pattern matching skills to solve challenging scientific problems.

154
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:42,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Although much attention has been recently given to the potential of crowdsourcing and game playing, this is the first instance that we are aware of in which online players solve the long-standing scientific problem.

155
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:48,065
[SPEAKER_07]: These results indicate potential for integrating video games into real-world scientific process.

156
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:57,570
[SPEAKER_07]: The ingenuity of the game players is formidable force that, if properly directed, can be used to solve a wide range of scientific problems.

157
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:06,274
[SPEAKER_07]: So you never know, they may be just using this for other diseases, obviously potentials unlimited, new forms of energy, who knows?

158
00:16:06,494 --> 00:16:13,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was reading before that they had broken, what was it, one of the HIV virus models, right?

159
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:14,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is what that's about.

160
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:22,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, think if they've come to that, this could be applied towards cancers, tumors, just about anything.

161
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:27,324
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is a good way to get new resources.

162
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:33,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Because any type of research, if it hits a dead end, it's going to need a fresh pair of eyes and a fresh brain to go with it.

163
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,868
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Foldit thing hasn't even been around that long.

164
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:44,171
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically 236,000 players, which as far as compared to Folding the Home, I think that's a lot less than what they've got.

165
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:45,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, I guess...

166
00:16:46,012 --> 00:17:06,558
[SPEAKER_07]: That they've been working together the last three years And it only took them ten days to unravel that actual scientific problem there So that one alone, ten days with that many people Can you imagine if they just integrated this into all the places that the folding at home stuff is?

167
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:13,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be pretty powerful And another thing too, this actually says a lot for the spirit of cooperation

168
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:39,736
[SPEAKER_06]: this is a lot of even though they have it set up as a competition in the end it's a lot of people working together and they're getting results by people having a common goal and working towards it and I think that we could all stand to learn something from that yeah cool so moving forward man that's actually super cool though I mean I'm still kind of whenever I try to think about the possibilities for that it actually makes my brain hurt a little bit

169
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:47,176
[SPEAKER_06]: So, how about something that won't make my brain hurt that much, because honestly, it's not surprising.

170
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:51,339
[SPEAKER_06]: 28% of 3DS users do not like the 3D feature.

171
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,901
[SPEAKER_06]: They say it detracts from their games.

172
00:17:55,162 --> 00:18:08,593
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a study done out by the research firm Interpret LLC that said 22% of those thought the 3D improved gameplay, but 13% were so put off by the effect that they turned it off altogether.

173
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:22,063
[SPEAKER_06]: 56% also found that their ideal 3D gaming experience was a 3D capable console connected to a TV with only 7% giving a nod towards the 3DS.

174
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:25,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think right now it's still really early.

175
00:18:26,044 --> 00:18:30,465
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just, I think a lot of games aren't using it correctly.

176
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:34,246
[SPEAKER_07]: And even this, I mean, goes to Nintendo.

177
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:42,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, some of their design choices in games are really stupid, especially like with Star Fox where they have the tilt controls and then the 3D.

178
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:43,369
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't work.

179
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:52,595
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to break the 3D because your 3D method requires people to basically have a certain perspective that you view the screen at.

180
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:57,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're turning and tilting the screen around, it's going to break that and it's going to turn it 2D anyways.

181
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:03,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, you could turn the 3D off and play with the tilt controls or turn it on and play with it without tilt controls.

182
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:13,369
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, to fully utilize the game, it's kind of impossible the way that they have it, I guess, unless you're supposed to tilt your whole body with that, which is kind of stupid.

183
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but yeah, 3D consoles, I think, is definitely the way to go.

184
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:23,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you noticed, though, that some people, when they play a game that requires turning and things, that they'll lean with their controller?

185
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:25,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, when you're five.

186
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:27,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't think anyone does that anymore.

187
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:29,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I do if I really get into it.

188
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:34,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, when I was playing Katamari, though, I'd get motion sick, so I'd actually follow the direction of the TV to keep from getting motion sick.

189
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:35,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I see.

190
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:35,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

191
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:38,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need my little pony in 3D

192
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:53,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

193
00:19:53,947 --> 00:20:02,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really... The only time I ever see that nowadays is when they have a stupid PR shot of people playing a video game and they're so excited!

194
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:05,624
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so psyched to be playing the game and they're just really getting into it.

195
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,988
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, it's just...

196
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:09,720
[SPEAKER_07]: 3D Glasses

197
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,279
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

198
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the one with Blu-ray?

199
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he didn't know because he's busy fucking making money and working.

200
00:20:54,380 --> 00:21:03,850
[SPEAKER_07]: He hasn't had time to game and that kind of stuff, but there's a lot of people out there that aren't really into games and aren't really aware of

201
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:06,087
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

202
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:44,070
[SPEAKER_07]: so there's going to be a lot of awareness going into the fourth quarter about the 3DS 3D stuff for the Playstation a little bit I think no whatsoever mention for the 3D stuff that they have on the 360 because there are a lot of games that do support 3D on the Xbox 360 but

203
00:21:47,432 --> 00:22:03,209
[SPEAKER_07]: but there's no mention of that because first party wise they don't really well actually I guess Gears 3 did but first party wise they don't really support 3D too much it's mainly just the third parties the cross platform stuff like you know Batman Arkham Asylum or

204
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:06,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, actually, Arkham Asylum had 3D support.

205
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:14,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the stereoscopic shutter glasses 3D, but the red cyan glasses.

206
00:22:14,155 --> 00:22:19,519
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they also have... But Arkham City does have 3D support, and there's some other games that do support 3D.

207
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:24,902
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not really advertised widely, I guess.

208
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:28,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

209
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:40,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what, now I'm trying to picture playing through, not like the old school Cyan Magenta, like the newer ones, right?

210
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:43,029
[SPEAKER_06]: That you don't really see Cyan and Magenta anymore.

211
00:22:44,224 --> 00:23:01,729
[SPEAKER_07]: I've honestly I haven't used those types of glasses in a long time and I still think that all I see is cyan and magenta and that stuff I mean it would be awesome if they had some sort of glasses like that that I didn't see that but I've never I haven't seen anything like that recently that doesn't affect the color

212
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:04,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Release dates Release dates

213
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:23,414
[SPEAKER_07]: The US is still going to have a lot of stuff coming out this week.

214
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, because we're in the fourth quarter, technically.

215
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:34,470
[SPEAKER_07]: So, starting things off, we've got FIFA Soccer 12 on the Wii coming out a little bit later than the rest of the platforms.

216
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Some re-releases from THQ.

217
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:38,472
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got a Beach Fun 2 pack.

218
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,433
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just some of their old party games.

219
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And a Game Show Fun pack, which is Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy.

220
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,476
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on the Wii.

221
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:48,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Gunslinger from Valcon.

222
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:52,779
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a generic on-rails shooter game for the Wii.

223

[SPEAKER_07]: Quest for Zoo from Activision.

224
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:56,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Cabela's.

225
00:23:56,481 --> 00:24:00,203
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the first of four Cabela's games this year.

226
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,425
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012.

227
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

228
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course they've got the Top Shot Elite bundles in the swell with those.

229
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:14,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Another game from Activision, X-Men Destiny, which is kind of an X-Men themed brawler game.

230
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:17,177
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

231
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:25,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Otli Artotri, The Adventurer of Arland, coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.

238
00:24:59,586 --> 00:25:04,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Ico and Shadow Colossus Collection on PlayStation 3 finally making its way out this week.

239
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:05,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely a must-buy.

[SPEAKER_07]: FIFA Soccer 12 on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PSP, Xbox 360, 3DS, and the Wii.

241
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:18,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, as I mentioned earlier, I believe the Wii is actually coming out later on.

242
00:25:19,312 --> 00:25:20,112
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not supposed to be this week.

243
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's next week.

244
00:25:21,072 --> 00:25:23,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

252
00:25:54,063 --> 00:25:55,243
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for US.

253
00:25:55,403 --> 00:25:57,844
[SPEAKER_07]: And then let's see here for Japan.

254
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:00,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Got a few things coming out this week.

255
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:01,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Over there,

[SPEAKER_07]: They also have a Monster Hunter console bundle over there, 250 gigabyte system, including an online trial pack.

258
00:26:18,765 --> 00:26:27,272
[SPEAKER_07]: A game called Code 18 coming out over there in Japan, and looks like it may be another dating sim.

259
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,514
[SPEAKER_07]: It's from Cyberfront Entertainment.

260
00:26:29,594 --> 00:26:34,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it definitely looks like a dating sim adventure game or something like that.

261
00:26:35,638 --> 00:26:38,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, adventure game.

262
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:39,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, moving on.

263
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:47,907

265
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:57,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on down here to PlayStation 3, I believe.

266
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:03,470
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got some weird games from Konami.

267
00:27:04,811 --> 00:27:10,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Formula One 2011 in Japan, they're getting their release over there for that game.

268
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:15,415
[SPEAKER_07]: MLB Bobblehead, that's coming from Konami.

269
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:17,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing on the Vita yet.

275
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,001
[SPEAKER_07]: That would still be quite early for the Vita.

276
00:27:41,722 --> 00:27:42,363
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP.

277
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:46,366
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple things on PSP.

00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:48,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like Bullet...

00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:51,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullet Butlers coming out.

280
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:52,147

[SPEAKER_07]: That's a weird title.

00:28:08,942 --> 00:28:12,625
[SPEAKER_07]: That's coming out as well, regular and limited edition.

288
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:14,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of stuff this week.

289
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:15,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,978

[SPEAKER_07]: That's coming out as well.

294
00:28:51,252 --> 00:28:53,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of games this week on the PSP, I'm surprised.

295
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:56,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy crap, there's a ton of stuff.

296
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:03,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Neon Genesis, Evangelion, Third Impact.

297
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:09,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming that's maybe a localized version, an Asian version or something like that.

298
00:29:10,593 --> 00:29:16,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Secret Game Portable, Yeti Best, that's coming out as well.

299
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:19,542
[SPEAKER_07]: They're even doing a...

300
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:26,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess a branded memory stick duo or whatever for Third Impact.

301
00:29:27,192 --> 00:29:29,735
[SPEAKER_07]: They love their Evangelion over there.

302
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:32,458
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, let's see, Wanda Fortune 2 and

303
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:52,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Tante Boo Detective Club that's coming out I guess as well lots of stuff on the PSP which is kind of odd because in the US man there's nothing there's like maybe three titles this year and left and that's it well

304
00:29:54,004 --> 00:29:57,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and then on the Wii, not a whole lot.

305
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:05,408
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pretty much just getting that Biohazard Chronicles value pack, which is the Umbrella Chronicles and Darkside Chronicles set.

306
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:07,929
[SPEAKER_07]: The two gun shooter games that they had.

307
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:09,469
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for the Wii.

308
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:10,630
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

309
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:41,513
[SPEAKER_07]: 3DS few things Hanatu Ikomo no Ritai Zukan no idea what that is but let's take a look here real quick no idea what that is looks like it has a butterfly on the cover weird maybe it's a bug collecting sim actually that could be bug collecting is kind of a big thing

310
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a bug collecting game.

311
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:49,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Bug collecting or maybe just photos or something.

312
00:30:49,437 --> 00:30:50,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Bird feeding.

313
00:30:50,177 --> 00:30:52,018
[SPEAKER_06]: You collect the bugs and feed the birds.

314
00:30:52,038 --> 00:31:03,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's something about photography because it's showing like they have stuff for shooting flowers and they've got kind of like a collage.

315
00:31:04,722 --> 00:31:08,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it looks like just nature photos or something.

316
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:09,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Some sort of

317
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:12,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Very niche.

318
00:31:14,634 --> 00:31:16,815
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, it's the Nintendo DS here.

319
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:22,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't know if they've really got anything.

320
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:23,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, actually, it's kind of neat.

321
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:33,586
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got some re-releases on PlayStation 2, Grand Theft Auto 3, Rockstar's Classic Edition, also San Andreas and Vice City Stories all making their way out as well.

322
00:31:34,387 --> 00:31:34,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

323
00:31:37,636 --> 00:31:50,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Haru Kanaru, Jinku no Kade 4, that's getting re-released as well, and Nintendo DS, nothing in Japan right now.

324
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:53,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo doesn't love you, Japan.

325
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:56,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at least no DSs this week.

326
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:56,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

327
00:31:57,571 --> 00:32:01,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how about we hop over a couple more oceans and get to Europe?

328
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:02,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Sound good?

329
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:06,735
[SPEAKER_06]: In the UK, we have stuff.

330
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:11,982
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 27th, Resident Evil Code Veronica X for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

331
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:16,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Ico and Shadow of the Colossus Collection HD for PS3 on the 28th.

332
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:17,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Also on the 28th, Mercury HG

333
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:48,714

334
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:51,634
[SPEAKER_07]: You got anything else for us?

335
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:53,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've got some stuff here.

336
00:32:54,236 --> 00:32:58,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I think we should do the classic game of the week.

337
00:32:59,198 --> 00:32:59,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

338
00:32:59,598 --> 00:32:59,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

339
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:01,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then let's go ahead and do the classic game of the week.

340
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,600
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as I find the music.

341
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:07,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we're like, you know, flipping things around here, it's a very short show.

342
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:08,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Might as well.

343
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:12,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then let's go ahead and get right into it.

344
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:27,214
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Classic Game of the Week, where I take you back in time in my TARDIS and show you games that you should have been playing.

345
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:28,435
[SPEAKER_06]: But did you play them?

346
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:29,316
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

347
00:33:29,937 --> 00:33:31,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you probably weren't born.

348
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn kids.

349
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:43,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Today's game is one called Quartet, that anyone who actually is a fan of Project D.Va might recognize the game.

350
00:33:44,450 --> 00:34:10,537
[SPEAKER_06]: you know um quartet came out in 1986 and it was an arcade game put out by Sega you could have one to four players um lead your characters through a base taken over by an army of robots and it was set in the fantasy zone as in fantasy zone and uh um space harrier in fact uh Dan was telling me that Sega had this whole thing where their set of games back in the day were all set in the fantasy zone that they were gonna say every one of their games were set there but that didn't quite catch on

351
00:34:11,932 --> 00:34:39,729
[SPEAKER_06]: at any rate you've got a character named Joe, Mary, Lee, or Edgar and you go through side-scrolling levels and you have to advance through the level and fight opponents that come out of portals in the walls and eventually defeat a boss that has the door key so you can go to the next level and you get different power-ups like a jetpack and springs for jumping and boosting and different kinds of fun like that so I'm going to go ahead and actually get the music playing since I didn't think about that so you can hear what it's like

352
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna start it over so you can hear it from the beginning because this is actually one of the best pieces of gaming music ever.

353
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:51,663
[SPEAKER_06]: If it will play.

354
00:35:13,775 --> 00:35:16,757
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from the Master System, so that's actually pretty good.

355
00:35:16,797 --> 00:35:19,900
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, Master System games really did have a lot of great music.

356
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:26,985
[SPEAKER_06]: At any rate, you've got different weapon types, different orbs that will give you power-ups.

357
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:31,849
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's another player's color, then it just gives you bonus points.

358
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:49,269
[SPEAKER_06]: and it came out around the same time as Gauntlet sort of like I guess Sega's answer to Gauntlet but it did come out on the Master System but you could only play as Mary or Edgar and it was misspelled E-D-G-E-R so it came out in Japan as Double Target but over here it still came out as Quartet

359
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,274
[SPEAKER_06]: There is also home versions.

360
00:35:53,314 --> 00:35:57,480
[SPEAKER_06]: There were Commodore 64, Amstrad, CPC, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum.

361
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:05,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Okie Rap and FM Funk music from the game were actually used later in the 1991 Spider-Man the video game.

362
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:16,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Quartet 2 is an updated version that was done in a conversion kit that you can only play two players in the arcade one, but you could still select your characters.

363
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:18,751
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's the game of the week is Quartet.

364
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:19,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Now...

365
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:38,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I was mentioning that fans of Project Diva should be able to recognize this song because a version of the song was used in Project Diva 2nd or I know it was in Project Diva Arcade so I was going to play a little bit of that for you guys now but if you stay tuned after the show, I'll play the whole thing.

366
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:42,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So here it goes.

367
00:37:08,317 --> 00:37:28,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to skip up the music, guys.

368
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:34,570
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the version from Project Diva.

369
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:35,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool, huh?

370
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:37,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

371
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:37,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

372
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:41,255
[SPEAKER_06]: What next?

373
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:42,981
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

374
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:44,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on along here.

375
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:45,849
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a few more stories left.

376
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:49,823
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see here.

377
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:56,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we were talking a little bit about, you know, Project D.Va and, you know, kind of reminds me of actually some of the Bomani games.

378
00:37:57,188 --> 00:38:03,592
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a new Bomani, well, not technically a new Bomani game, but a new game to the arcades, I should say.

379
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:08,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Evolution, which was basically titled Dance Masters over here in the U.S.

380
00:38:08,816 --> 00:38:13,959
[SPEAKER_07]: You may remember it as kind of the Kinect dancing game from Konami that didn't really sell very well, but...

381
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,341
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like Para, I guess.

382
00:38:17,182 --> 00:38:25,389
[SPEAKER_07]: But now it is making full circle and going to the arcades where they have an actual cabinet that's being location tested right now.

383
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:37,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love the first licensed song because it does kind of sum up everything.

384
00:38:37,801 --> 00:38:40,303
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first licensed song is Irony.

385
00:38:41,564 --> 00:38:47,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Irony by Clary S and a couple other Japanese songs.

386
00:38:47,507 --> 00:38:52,690
[SPEAKER_07]: One from AKB48 and Morning Musume.

387
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, some Konami originals on the cabinet as well.

388
00:38:56,992 --> 00:39:00,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Agatia's Dream by Naoki featuring Smell Decay.

389
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:04,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Into Your Heart, the Roughage remix, Naoki featuring Yasmin.

390
00:39:05,537 --> 00:39:26,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep On Movin' by NMR, Kimono Princess by June, My Summer Love by Mitsuo with Gela, and let's see, Open Your Eyes, Naokimeda featuring JB, and Still In My Heart by Naoki, and Unity by The Remembers.

391
00:39:28,161 --> 00:39:28,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds fun.

392
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:34,222
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd have to really do a lot of the upgrades to make it compete with just getting a home version.

393
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's basically, yeah.

394
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:40,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, from the look of the cabinet, it's got a camera in there as well.

395
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:43,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And they didn't really show any sort of, like...

396
00:39:45,814 --> 00:39:46,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

397
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:17,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, looking at the screenshots, it looks just like a straight port of the game.

398
00:40:17,608 --> 00:40:22,017
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, interesting, I guess.

399
00:40:22,278 --> 00:40:22,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

400
00:40:23,649 --> 00:40:24,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd play it.

401
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Then again, I like Dance Masters.

402
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:35,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I would, but it lacked some stuff as far as cues on what the hell to do.

403
00:40:36,993 --> 00:40:39,473
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, if you're used to playing par, I guess it's not too different.

404
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:46,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, especially not too different if you're playing certain songs in the game because the par routines are basically the routines from the game.

405
00:40:47,256 --> 00:40:48,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I don't know.

406
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:50,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's still pretty neat.

407
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually really want to see a machine before I pass judgment on it.

408
00:40:54,903 --> 00:40:57,130
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we'll get one over here eventually.

409
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:02,721
[SPEAKER_06]: And in other news, now there is a game that I have mentioned to everybody before.

410
00:41:02,941 --> 00:41:04,081
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Snatcher.

411
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:10,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a radio drama called Datcher, S-D-A-T-H-E-R.

412
00:41:11,123 --> 00:41:13,824
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first two episodes of it have been translated.

413
00:41:14,924 --> 00:41:16,664
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's actually pretty cool.

414
00:41:17,044 --> 00:41:24,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will link that to the chat room so that anyone who is a Snatcher fan will be able to see it.

415
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:32,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I would actually just like for them to do another update of the game so I can play it again.

416
00:41:33,738 --> 00:41:49,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe as soon as he finishes all the other damn projects he has on deck, like the Metal Gear Solid 3D game for 3DS that's still not out yet, or oh, I don't know, the Metal Gear Rising game that's I don't even know where the hell happened with that game.

417
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:50,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's

418
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:53,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the end of next year.

419
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:57,611
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, he has his new Fox engine that he's working on games for.

420
00:41:57,691 --> 00:41:59,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it could be a while.

421
00:42:01,912 --> 00:42:10,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I would very much like to... See, that's the problem with talented people that get too much on their plate.

422
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:12,354
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get the right stuff on their plate.

423
00:42:13,775 --> 00:42:14,655
[SPEAKER_06]: At least to come out anyway.

424
00:42:15,037 --> 00:42:16,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, I agree, Zeether.

425
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:17,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Snatcher kicks ass.

426
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:26,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually got Snatcher for PS1, but of course it's all in Japanese and my husband lost patience with it really quickly.

427
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:28,429
[SPEAKER_06]: But who knows.

428
00:42:28,509 --> 00:42:31,752
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go ahead and open up Ye Olde Skype line.

429
00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:34,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I will change this to online.

430
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:36,177
[SPEAKER_06]: You can give us a call.

431
00:42:36,297 --> 00:42:37,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Our number is 1-8... Is it 866...

433
00:42:47,456 --> 00:42:49,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you afraid?

434
00:42:53,795 --> 00:42:55,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are we waiting for calls to come in?

435
00:42:55,757 --> 00:42:59,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to read a couple of things.

436
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,002
[SPEAKER_07]: A third round of songs have been announced for Dance Dance Revolution 2.

437
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:07,246
[SPEAKER_07]: In case you're interested in picking up the Wii version, I'm glad to see that DM Ashura is still getting work.

438
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:09,648
[SPEAKER_07]: He has a song in there called Aftershock.

00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:12,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, of course, K with Dirty Digital.

[SPEAKER_06]: So I will go ahead and pick this up.

[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, CD Thunder, and a happy belated birthday to you.

449
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:01,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

450
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

451
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,001
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's up?

452
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:03,501
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

453
00:44:05,262 --> 00:44:05,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too much.

454
00:44:06,003 --> 00:44:08,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Just have a couple things to discuss.

455
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:10,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

456
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:19,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I've, uh, first thing is, um, I'd like to talk about one of my favorite video game characters of all time.

457
00:44:19,862 --> 00:44:20,502
[SPEAKER_06]: And who is that?

458
00:44:21,182 --> 00:44:21,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario.

459
00:44:22,102 --> 00:44:22,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

460
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:25,263
[SPEAKER_06]: So why is Mario your favorite?

461
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:27,884
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorites.

462
00:44:28,004 --> 00:44:28,964
[SPEAKER_06]: One of your favorites, okay.

463
00:44:29,184 --> 00:44:30,665
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you want to say about Mario?

464
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Fireflower, Feather, Cape

465
00:44:56,522 --> 00:45:03,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm actually a really fan of Pulse Boot, not Pulse, that's Pulse Voice I'm thinking of, of the little boot thing.

466
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:04,589
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kubrick shoe?

467
00:45:04,729 --> 00:45:05,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Kubrick, thank you.

468
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've seen that before, actually.

469
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,673
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Super Mario Bros.

470
00:45:09,933 --> 00:45:09,673
3.

471
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:10,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

472
00:45:11,995 --> 00:45:17,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I... Yeah, I mean, I haven't played many of the games.

473
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:22,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've played, like, Super Mario... The new Super Mario Bros.

474
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:23,904
[SPEAKER_04]: for the DS and a lot of others, but...

475
00:45:27,051 --> 00:45:28,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like everything about him.

476
00:45:29,013 --> 00:45:29,493
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

477
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:32,836
[SPEAKER_06]: So you said there were a couple of things you wanted to talk about.

478
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:33,376
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the other?

479
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:37,720
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one is I want to talk about prototype.

480
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Prototype, okay.

481
00:45:40,642 --> 00:45:44,385
[SPEAKER_04]: What I like about that is you're a guy who's basically a human weapon.

482
00:45:44,545 --> 00:45:46,087
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do pretty much everything.

483
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:51,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could blow up the earth if you wanted to?

484
00:45:54,766 --> 00:45:55,267
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you say?

485
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,748
[SPEAKER_04]: You could blow up the earth if you wanted to.

486
00:45:57,648 --> 00:46:03,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe, but like how you can... What is it called?

487
00:46:03,853 --> 00:46:09,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you consume other people and you can actually turn into them if you need to to sneak around places.

488
00:46:10,497 --> 00:46:12,199
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like episodes of Supernatural.

489
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:14,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, are you looking forward to the sequel coming out next year?

490
00:46:15,361 --> 00:46:16,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Prototype 2?

491
00:46:17,602 --> 00:46:21,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't actually seen anything about that, so I'm not sure what I feel on that yet.

492
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:42,948
[SPEAKER_04]: and uh and what you basically do with your character is a lot of free running the parkour stuff because you can you run up the walls and do flips and all that type of thing yeah that's pretty cool I didn't ever play it oh really I've been too busy playing WoW

493
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:44,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict?

494
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:47,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's my dealer and I can't yell at him.

495
00:46:51,657 --> 00:46:55,281
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to see what you guys thought of Mario.

496
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,743
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your opinions on him?

497
00:46:58,344 --> 00:46:58,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Iconic.

498
00:46:59,145 --> 00:46:59,926
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I can say.

499
00:47:03,229 --> 00:47:04,390
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good character, I guess.

500
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:05,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Good franchise for Nintendo.

501
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:12,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, that was pretty much all I wanted to call in about.

502
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And, yeah, birthday was yesterday and I turned 19.

503
00:47:17,112 --> 00:47:18,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Party time!

504
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:18,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday.

505
00:47:18,993 --> 00:47:20,874
[SPEAKER_06]: You're only two years away from the big party.

506
00:47:21,835 --> 00:47:22,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

507
00:47:23,196 --> 00:47:24,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you have a good one.

508
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:25,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for calling in.

509
00:47:25,737 --> 00:47:25,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

510
00:47:26,378 --> 00:47:26,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

511
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:31,981
[SPEAKER_06]: So, any other callers want to give us a call?

512
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:37,204
[SPEAKER_06]: You can call us at 877-GAME-OLR or reach us on Skype or Orange Sounds Radio.

513
00:47:38,004 --> 00:47:38,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Please call...

514
00:47:40,684 --> 00:47:42,045
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're waiting for more calls here.

515
00:47:43,746 --> 00:47:51,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of neat, Assassin's Creed, one of those games now that they're going to be adding more content to the PlayStation 3 version in the form of an older game.

516
00:47:52,454 --> 00:48:05,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like how Bioshock Infinite is going to have the original Bioshock in there, Assassin's Creed Revelations is going to have the original Assassin's Creed on the same disc because, you know, hey, the game doesn't use up all the Blu-ray space and they can do that and...

517
00:48:06,207 --> 00:48:11,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, they haven't really done anything to the original game as far as adding trophy support or anything like that.

518
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:15,152
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, you get another game in case you maybe don't have the first Assassin's Creed.

519
00:48:16,412 --> 00:48:16,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

520
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:17,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Need a guess.

521
00:48:19,974 --> 00:48:24,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I was going to mention Final Fantasy XIV is actually getting some updates.

522
00:48:25,197 --> 00:48:25,697
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a call.

523
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we hold that one for after?

524
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:29,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, thank you for calling Orange Jones Radio.

525
00:48:30,019 --> 00:48:30,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is this?

526
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,031
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Kaijudo, can you hear me?

527
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:33,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can.

528
00:48:33,972 --> 00:48:34,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Kaijudo.

529
00:48:35,574 --> 00:48:36,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?

530
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:43,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Really don't know what to talk about, but your last caller, when he was talking about Mario, and it made me think about something.

531
00:48:43,681 --> 00:48:46,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hell doesn't Mario have a kid yet?

532
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:47,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how old is he by now?

533
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:49,026
[SPEAKER_02]: About 40, 50?

534
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:53,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but they say that sometimes obesity affects fertility.

535
00:48:55,291 --> 00:48:55,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

536
00:48:56,815 --> 00:49:02,677
[SPEAKER_06]: That maybe, you know, he seems to be a very, well, maybe, you know, fungus people and humans aren't compatible.

537
00:49:03,918 --> 00:49:04,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe so.

538
00:49:04,498 --> 00:49:08,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I forgot that Princess Peach isn't necessarily from this dimension.

539
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:12,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Either that or she's, you know, produced spores, but they mutated and turned into Goombas.

540
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:19,832
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't know, I guess next thing I talk about is games I'm looking forward to.

541
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:29,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been going over my game list, like what I plan on buying and I just realized that I don't think I'm buying anything for the Xbox 360 for the rest of this year.

542
00:49:29,235 --> 00:49:29,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

543
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:33,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think everything that I'm buying is basically going to be for PlayStation 3.

544
00:49:34,616 --> 00:49:42,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Battlefield 3, I'm getting for PlayStation 3 just because, you know, it's like single disc and you're promised there's...

545
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:44,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh, sorry.

546
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:46,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a call back, sorry.

547
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:47,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

548
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:52,295
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?

549
00:49:52,635 --> 00:49:56,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I accidentally picked up a call by accident, so my bad.

550
00:49:57,937 --> 00:49:58,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

551
00:49:58,837 --> 00:50:05,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to call... Yeah, this is ghetto-ass broken radio.

552
00:50:07,265 --> 00:50:09,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I didn't mean, I called you again by accident.

553
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:10,706
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have Rob edit this out.

554
00:50:11,187 --> 00:50:12,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I will call you back as soon as this call is over.

555
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:13,308
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?

556
00:50:13,888 --> 00:50:14,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

557
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:15,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

558
00:50:22,171 --> 00:50:24,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now I'm trying to figure out how to accept the call again.

559
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:25,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Resume call.

560
00:50:26,053 --> 00:50:26,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, sorry.

561
00:50:28,994 --> 00:50:29,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you there?

562
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:32,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm here.

563
00:50:32,744 --> 00:50:33,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?

564
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:34,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry.

565
00:50:35,526 --> 00:50:38,987
[SPEAKER_06]: We got another caller pop up and accidentally hit the answer button, so it put you on hold.

566
00:50:39,868 --> 00:50:40,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

567
00:50:40,548 --> 00:50:41,909
[SPEAKER_06]: So, my apologies.

568
00:50:41,949 --> 00:50:44,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm normally not the one that handles the skyline, as you can tell.

569
00:50:45,391 --> 00:50:46,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm getting, like, double talk now.

570
00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:48,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fun.

571
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:50,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Well... Oh, wait a second.

572
00:50:50,993 --> 00:50:51,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there it is.

573
00:50:51,634 --> 00:50:51,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

574
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:53,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned down my computer.

575
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,175
[SPEAKER_06]: That would help.

576
00:50:54,995 --> 00:50:56,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm sorry, what were you saying?

577
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:59,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so, I mean, every game that I'm getting is pretty much going to be for PS3.

578
00:50:59,337 --> 00:51:00,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I just realized that, so...

579
00:51:01,465 --> 00:51:01,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

580
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'm the only one.

581
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:06,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe 2012 is going to be the year of PS3 maybe.

582
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:10,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it seems like it's about time they did something right, huh?

583
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:11,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

584
00:51:12,148 --> 00:51:12,648
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about time.

585
00:51:13,129 --> 00:51:16,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, it's like we said, the system's only as good as the games that are on it.

586
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:17,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.

587
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:18,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

588
00:51:19,591 --> 00:51:19,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

589
00:51:19,991 --> 00:51:20,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.

590
00:51:20,471 --> 00:51:21,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, goodnight.

591
00:51:21,271 --> 00:51:22,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, sorry for the mix-up.

592
00:51:22,892 --> 00:51:23,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's no problem.

593
00:51:23,512 --> 00:51:23,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, bye-bye.

594
00:51:26,858 --> 00:51:35,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now I will try to get a hold of Zeether again, who was calling and I was being a derp.

595
00:51:37,022 --> 00:51:37,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Zeether, are you there?

596
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:42,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, it's Zeether from the chat.

597
00:51:42,263 --> 00:51:42,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

598
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:47,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking of something to call about, and I finally thought of something.

599
00:51:48,966 --> 00:51:50,826
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard of Retro Game Challenge, right?

600
00:51:50,846 --> 00:51:51,687
[SPEAKER_01]: The DS game?

601
00:51:52,427 --> 00:51:52,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

602
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:52,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

603
00:51:55,101 --> 00:52:06,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching the show that it's based on, Game Center CX and it is awesome it is just one of the best things I've ever watched one of the best Japanese television shows I've ever watched so what do you like about it?

604
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:21,962
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really fun to watch because it has this guy struggling to get through the games to get to the end and it's just cool watching him constantly try to make it through and spending out these hours planning things out and getting through it

605
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:25,222
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds pretty cool.

606
00:52:25,302 --> 00:52:26,823
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just, you like the struggle.

607
00:52:27,664 --> 00:52:31,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very, they make it, like, overly dramatic sometimes.

608
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:36,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, he'll be at, like, this impasse, and they'll be like, and they'll be like, oh, how is he gonna get through this?

609
00:52:36,932 --> 00:52:39,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he gonna be able to beat this enemy that's giving him trouble?

610
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:45,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, in one episode, he was doing ghosts and goblins, and the red demon was constantly giving him hell.

611
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:49,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, how is he gonna get past this guy?

612
00:52:49,423 --> 00:52:50,985
[SPEAKER_01]: He's stuck in game over hell.

613
00:52:51,591 --> 00:52:57,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that, I can imagine, too, because, like, that last level is especially crappy with the red demon.

614
00:52:57,993 --> 00:53:04,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, and when he found out he had to do it all over again, he was like, I'm not gonna do this, I'm gonna just hand it over to one of the other guys, he's gonna do it.

615
00:53:05,635 --> 00:53:09,536
[SPEAKER_06]: It's... Oh, yeah, because you beat the game, and then it's like, no, go back.

616
00:53:09,556 --> 00:53:10,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, you have to do it again.

617
00:53:11,496 --> 00:53:14,257
[SPEAKER_06]: That, that was, that game was, like, one of the ultimate in rage quits.

618
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:41,672
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah it's definitely and he actually I actually found out the guy who was on the guy who did the guy on the show who does the gate planes playing the games his name is Arno he was actually in California at one point that like a couple weeks ago he was doing a special taped special that was going to be him going to the US and and a lot of people showed up that's pretty cool

619
00:53:43,169 --> 00:53:46,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Retro Game Challenge game is also extremely fun.

620
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,951
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely one of my favorite DS games.

621
00:53:50,091 --> 00:53:55,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to check that out, given, you know, my husband and I are like the huge game, old school game people.

622
00:53:56,134 --> 00:53:57,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very good.

623
00:53:57,174 --> 00:54:00,255
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some really, really good games in it.

624
00:54:00,295 --> 00:54:08,838
[SPEAKER_01]: The sequel didn't come out here, but there's actually a group that's working on a fan translation for it, and so far, from what I can tell, it looks pretty close to what we got here for the first game.

625
00:54:09,238 --> 00:54:09,998
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds awesome.

626
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:11,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

627
00:54:13,044 --> 00:54:19,255
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah, Snatcher really good game, Snatcher is fantastic I've still been trying to find a Sega CD copy

628
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:21,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it's really hard to find it.

629
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:24,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just had to emulate, but it's really good.

630
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:26,350
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like it.

631
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:27,950
[SPEAKER_01]: The plot is great.

632
00:54:28,491 --> 00:54:33,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get back to it because I've gotten pretty far into the... pretty decently far into the game.

633
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:35,193
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really good.

634
00:54:35,213 --> 00:54:36,053
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the music.

635
00:54:36,113 --> 00:54:38,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the voice acting.

636
00:54:38,394 --> 00:54:42,055
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very well done for a game that's from the early 90s.

637
00:54:42,255 --> 00:54:43,455
[SPEAKER_06]: The little Metal Gear cameo.

638
00:54:44,216 --> 00:54:46,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Metal Gear walking around.

639
00:54:46,976 --> 00:54:47,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I especially liked...

640
00:54:49,045 --> 00:55:15,729
[SPEAKER_01]: the club, the Outer Heaven Club and when you went there you got to pick a mask and I picked the Moai head and there was all the Konami characters there and who was it Gillian was like, I don't know if we fit in and Metal Gear was like, I think we fit in more than you think and I kind of caught that subtle Gradius reference very, very cool Yeah, that's super neat Well, pretty cool So you got anything else for us?

641
00:55:16,488 --> 00:55:17,288
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nothing else.

642
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:20,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well I'm sorry that I hung up on you earlier.

643
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:21,689
[SPEAKER_01]: It's alright.

644
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I attribute that to derp, because it's the derpisode.

645
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,370
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mad buggy.

646
00:55:27,931 --> 00:55:28,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Bug report!

647
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:29,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

648
00:55:29,871 --> 00:55:30,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, later.

649
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:31,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Later.

650
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:35,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright guys, you can give us a call.

651
00:55:35,172 --> 00:55:36,532
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take one more call.

652
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:37,473
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at 877-GAME-OLR.

653
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:41,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any other last minute stories for us?

654
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,056
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

655
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:31,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you have reached Orange Lounge Radio.

656
00:56:31,812 --> 00:56:32,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is this?

657
00:56:33,012 --> 00:56:34,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, it's Xenocore from the OKC.

658
00:56:34,452 --> 00:56:35,032
[SPEAKER_00]: How y'all doing?

659
00:56:35,273 --> 00:56:35,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing good.

660
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:36,553
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Xenocore?

661
00:56:37,653 --> 00:56:38,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Well rested from my trip.

662
00:56:38,794 --> 00:56:45,735
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you might have heard a bit when I spoke on Bobby, but yeah, driving to Florida and back is no fun.

663
00:56:45,795 --> 00:56:47,296
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't sound like fun at all.

664
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:51,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, especially when it's just for family duties and not a real vacation.

665
00:56:51,137 --> 00:56:53,217
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we're here about games.

666
00:56:53,658 --> 00:56:53,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

667
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:55,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is up?

668
00:56:56,509 --> 00:56:56,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much.

669
00:56:57,309 --> 00:57:03,791
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to include a small thing on top of, you know, Arino playing old school games on Game Center CX.

670
00:57:03,811 --> 00:57:07,252
[SPEAKER_00]: He also does do interviews with some of the game makers in Japan.

671
00:57:07,552 --> 00:57:09,753
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already talked to the guys in charge of Castlevania.

672
00:57:10,133 --> 00:57:13,274
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked to Kojima about Metal Gear and its history and other things like that.

673
00:57:13,594 --> 00:57:18,435
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that, like, for instance, Kotaku is covering the gaming that he's doing and doing some...

674
00:57:19,213 --> 00:57:20,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Awful voiceover and some of the stuff.

675
00:57:21,454 --> 00:57:28,799
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's an account on YouTube that somebody's been putting all the fan subs that have been done online.

676
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:30,860
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put a link to one of them in chat.

677
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,843
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've got over 24 of the episodes already, including the one where he went to Korea and talked to some gamers over there as well.

678
00:57:37,383 --> 00:57:39,244
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really an outstanding show.

679
00:57:39,925 --> 00:57:41,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to check that out.

680
00:57:41,486 --> 00:57:43,467
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it sounds like something totally up my alley.

681
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:47,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've heard of it before, but I haven't ever seen any.

682
00:57:47,918 --> 00:57:50,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right around 903 in chat.

683
00:57:50,202 --> 00:57:52,806
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take that link, that'll give you the account name.

684
00:57:52,846 --> 00:57:54,849
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like Active Circle or something like that.

685
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,692
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's putting all that stuff on there.

686
00:57:56,712 --> 00:57:57,373
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give it a go.

687
00:57:57,995 --> 00:57:59,817
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing...

688
00:58:02,186 --> 00:58:13,451
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still curious as to whether or not as much as I loved Space Marine I've heard rumors that the multiplayer population has already died out.

689
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:14,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

690
00:58:14,631 --> 00:58:15,751
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sucks.

691
00:58:15,811 --> 00:58:17,392
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's accurate or not.

692
00:58:17,592 --> 00:58:24,095
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably just fanboys complaining but I hope not because that game was awesome and I played it from Gamefly.

693
00:58:24,455 --> 00:58:29,917
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to get a full version of it but I'm not going to do it if the multiplayer isn't there because that's the only thing that's left in there for me.

694
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, if the game doesn't give you what you want, what's the point, right?

695
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:38,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it gave me everything I wanted, but it was the single player.

696
00:58:38,504 --> 00:58:39,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you go through that, you pretty much know it.

697
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:45,285
[SPEAKER_00]: As fun as it is, I'm not the kind of guy that can just do that repeatedly and get enjoyment out of it.

698
00:58:46,245 --> 00:58:51,786
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope they make another one, because that was an outstanding representation of what to do with that franchise.

699
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:53,807
[SPEAKER_06]: They can keep their fingers crossed, right?

700
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:55,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Offer a little prayer.

701
00:58:56,584 --> 00:58:57,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, yep.

702
00:58:58,465 --> 00:58:59,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome job today, guys.

703
00:59:00,347 --> 00:59:02,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Sky isn't missing a thing, so good job.

704
00:59:02,648 --> 00:59:08,012
[SPEAKER_06]: He actually just texted that he made it to San Francisco, and I was going to reply that I'm hateful and jealous, but nah.

705
00:59:09,193 --> 00:59:09,933
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.

706
00:59:09,993 --> 00:59:16,378
[SPEAKER_00]: He has to stay in the audience with the rest of the... Granted, Lady Tron's playing, but he's going to get funk right all over him, so you know.

707
00:59:16,758 --> 00:59:18,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's going to come back smelling like pot.

708
00:59:21,301 --> 00:59:22,222
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he's going to get sick.

709
00:59:22,342 --> 00:59:22,782
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

710
00:59:23,243 --> 00:59:24,263
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, thank you for calling.

711
00:59:24,443 --> 00:59:25,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have anything else?

712
00:59:25,936 --> 00:59:27,618
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's pretty much it, pretty light today.

713
00:59:28,158 --> 00:59:31,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty, well you take care and we will hear from you next week, maybe?

714
00:59:32,283 --> 00:59:32,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.

715
00:59:33,124 --> 00:59:35,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week we actually have a special guest on the show.

716
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:36,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Another host.

717
00:59:37,268 --> 00:59:38,830
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Dan, so I guess he's not that special.

718
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:39,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he's special.

719
00:59:40,231 --> 00:59:41,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Special to me.

720
00:59:41,573 --> 00:59:43,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit special.

721
00:59:43,855 --> 00:59:46,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, bye-bye.

722
00:59:46,438 --> 00:59:47,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, later.

723
00:59:48,675 --> 00:59:56,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that was our last call of the night and sorry anyone else who was trying to get in because believe it or not we did have people trying to get in but nope, that was it.

724
00:59:56,778 --> 00:59:58,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually do have another story.

725
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:07,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little story that came to us courtesy of Tiger Claw.

726
01:00:08,322 --> 01:00:14,965
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's that Microsoft is allowing a small number of mistakenly banned Xbox 360 players back on Xbox Live.

727
01:00:16,278 --> 01:00:27,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So they actually, Stephen Toulouse wrote a blog about that some of the suspensions were mistakenly made by a different software being used and so they are bringing those people back.

728
01:00:27,628 --> 01:00:32,672
[SPEAKER_06]: They're unbanning them and will give them a free three month subscription to Xbox Live Gold and 1600 Microsoft points.

729
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:43,095
[SPEAKER_06]: and they said it was a very specific issue and it happened between August 29th and September 9th so they've got it lined up.

730
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:46,497
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that's nice of them saying, oh, we screwed up here.

731
01:00:49,265 --> 01:00:51,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have anything else for us?

732
01:00:51,386 --> 01:00:56,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one thing real quick, and it's more of a PSA than anything.

733
01:00:56,629 --> 01:01:00,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember I talked about the Tommy Wee Show?

734
01:01:01,572 --> 01:01:08,835
[SPEAKER_07]: That, I guess, is something that's running from Machima on YouTube and stuff like that.

735
01:01:09,255 --> 01:01:13,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they had the first episode featuring Tommy Wiseau.

736
01:01:14,558 --> 01:01:38,765
[SPEAKER_07]: and it is fucking stupid first off it's a ripoff of Mr. Sanctuary 3000 secondly Tommy Wiseau cannot form English sentences he's just it's just so fucking stupid and the only humor that you'd find in this is that he's really stupid so I mean if you like watching stupid people play games I'm sure there's plenty of

737
01:01:40,555 --> 01:01:41,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

738
01:01:51,585 --> 01:02:18,418
[SPEAKER_07]: well that's just and it's not even to the fact that he's mocking a game being played it's him playing a game while this alien's mocking him and I mean at one point he accidentally hits the playstation button and it goes to the cross menu bar and he's just how do I get out of this I mean it's dumb so please don't watch it just let it die in a fire

739
01:02:18,849 --> 01:02:19,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame.

740
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's it for OLR.

741
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,391
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm actually going to go ahead and play.

742
01:02:25,332 --> 01:02:26,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you know, I closed the show roll.

743
01:02:26,612 --> 01:02:27,032
[SPEAKER_06]: So never mind.

744
01:02:27,052 --> 01:02:27,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to play anything.

745
01:02:28,313 --> 01:02:31,314
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to give everyone a little bitty tip.

746
01:02:31,774 --> 01:02:37,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned after the show and you will hear a blast from the past in the form of a modified pump up the volume.

747
01:02:38,957 --> 01:02:40,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you have any final thoughts?

748
01:02:42,337 --> 01:02:42,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, no.

749
01:02:43,398 --> 01:02:50,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't have any either, except that I'm just gonna do some music for about an hour so that you guys don't feel, you know, like we've gone, huh, don't wanna, okay.

750
01:02:51,445 --> 01:02:52,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, thank you for listening.
