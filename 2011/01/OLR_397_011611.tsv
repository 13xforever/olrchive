0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	8000	Who's your hosts?
8000	12000	Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku
13000	16000	Tonight, January 16th, 2011
16000	19000	Another MMO is set to go free to play this month
19000	22000	An upcoming fighting game plans to punish rage quitters
22000	25000	And will the 3DS be region locked after all?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	36000	And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	38000	The show where every gamer has a voice
38000	40000	We tape live at All Games Radio
40000	43000	Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
43000	45000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
45000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you for the next few hours
47000	50000	Along with my co-host, not here tonight sadly
50000	53000	The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
53000	54000	Is absent from the studio tonight
54000	56000	She may be coming about halfway through the show
56000	59000	But she is out at a pinball collecting type of event
59000	62000	It's a private thing so it's not something you would have read about on the internet
62000	64000	But she's having a pretty good time
64000	66000	I know I got a text from her earlier today
66000	68000	That she met some famous pinball maker
68000	70000	So hopefully she makes it back in time during the show
70000	72000	And we can ask her all about her experience there
72000	74000	I know there was beer involved
74000	76000	I don't think there's any beer involved though
76000	77000	With our other co-hosts tonight
77000	80000	Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki
80000	82000	How you doing, Loki?
82000	83000	I'm doing fine
83000	85000	Alright, what's new in your world?
85000	87000	How's the baby? How's the wife?
87000	89000	Uh, baby's fine
89000	91000	And wife is doing fine
91000	93000	I don't know if she's over at her mom's house right now
93000	95000	She visits her every day
95000	97000	Or, well, every Sunday
97000	99000	That's awesome that you guys have a Sunday planned
99000	101000	So you can kind of keep doing the show
101000	103000	We'd be screwed without Loki
103000	105000	She doesn't always get over there
105000	107000	I still come here
107000	110000	Let's move on to a special guest joining us tonight
110000	112000	Who's going to be filling in for Dark Sakura
112000	114000	Now, Dark Sakura
114000	116000	Her position could never be filled
116000	117000	But he's going to try
117000	119000	Say hello everybody to Salacious Pop
119000	120000	Hello
120000	121000	How are you Salacious Pop?
121000	122000	I'm great
122000	124000	I'm pinch hitting for Jamie and I get to read stories
124000	126000	It'll be fun
126000	128000	If anyone hears a thud
128000	130000	It's because Rob threw a shoe at me
130000	132000	Because I missed my story cue
132000	134000	And I'm letting there be dead air
134000	136000	So if you hear thud
136000	138000	Stuff happened today
138000	140000	That's what happened there
140000	142000	Just looking forward to it
142000	144000	Again, I don't know how long Dark Sakura's going to be out
144000	146000	She didn't really give a firm time
146000	148000	Because I think she just kind of didn't know
148000	150000	You know, sometimes you get invited to those things
150000	152000	And you're like, I don't know
152000	154000	And I get the sense that it might be a little far away
154000	156000	It might be in the Bay Area
156000	158000	So if they haven't even left the par-tay yet
158000	160000	She might be gone for a while
160000	162000	Yeah, so she might show up and just be like
162000	164000	You get the hell up out my seat
164000	166000	Give me my mic and get out
166000	168000	And that's when I'm going to, you know, bail to the living room
168000	170000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com where we have the live chatters
170000	172000	Every Sunday night while we do tape
172000	174000	I'm noticing
174000	176000	ActDeaf in our chat room says, DarkSakura ain't home
176000	178000	Party!
178000	180000	Actually, it is a little weird
180000	182000	We're in her house right now
182000	184000	And she's very kind
184000	186000	Her and Dan, really, because he lives here too
186000	188000	Letting us kind of come in and do our show anyway
188000	190000	I have the super secret way of getting in the house
190000	192000	When they're not here that I can't say
192000	194000	Because, you know, we don't want the robbers to show up
194000	196000	But yeah, she's very kind
196000	198000	And letting us kind of take over the house
198000	200000	But it's a little weird, I think
200000	202000	To be in someone's house when they're not here
202000	204000	And it's not like a house sitting type of thing
204000	206000	Like, I didn't feed Shermy
206000	208000	Shermy doesn't need to be fed
208000	210000	Shermy's just asleep, Shermy don't give a shit tonight
210000	212000	But anyhow, alright
212000	214000	Enough talk about being in the house when the owners aren't home
214000	216000	And kiddies and so forth
216000	218000	Let's talk about video games
218000	220000	And we'll start off tonight with how is your gaming week
220000	222000	We have to mix it up a little bit tonight because DarkSakura's not here
222000	224000	So we'll start with Loki, how was your gaming week?
224000	226000	It was alright, I didn't play
226000	228000	A ton of things, we have
228000	230000	The new mod games going for Grand Theft Auto
230000	232000	So we've been playing that this week
232000	234000	It's weird though, we've been running into a bunch of
234000	236000	Strange glitches and I'm not really sure
236000	238000	What it's from, I think it might be
238000	240000	Some leftover data that's in the save files
240000	242000	Or something, but
242000	244000	We have it set to all of our
244000	246000	Cop cars are flying around and stuff
246000	248000	But for some reason when we're playing
248000	250000	The single player game, some of the cop cars
250000	252000	Don't fly, so it makes me think
252000	254000	That some of the old data is in there
254000	256000	And then also we've been having issues
256000	258000	With cars disappearing on us
258000	260000	So it'll look like we're flying around
260000	264000	And we're impervious to fire in free mode
264000	266000	For some reason, and it's odd
266000	268000	Because I didn't even touch any of those files
268000	270000	That would affect that, so
270000	272000	It's just a bunch of strange glitches
272000	274000	But I'm working on it
274000	276000	And then other than that
276000	280000	I played a little bit of
280000	282000	What did I play this week actually?
282000	284000	Oh, I tried a bit of
284000	286000	Angry Birds because I've had it
286000	288000	Purchased on my
288000	290000	iPod for the longest time now
290000	292000	And I gotta admit, I don't
292000	294000	I don't understand it, I don't understand what the
294000	296000	Big draw is, it's alright, it's
296000	298000	Kind of fun, but
298000	300000	I got bored of it really quick
300000	302000	So I don't know why everyone's
302000	304000	So gung-ho about it and like
304000	306000	Have this big raging heart on for the game
306000	308000	Because it's not that great
308000	310000	I'm not sure I understand America's
310000	312000	Obsession with Angry Birds either
312000	314000	It's okay, it's
314000	316000	For an iPhone game, it's fine
316000	318000	But it's not something like, oh my god
318000	320000	It's gotta warrant movie rights
320000	322000	And shit like that
322000	324000	And shirts, I went into Hot Topic the other day
324000	326000	There's Angry Birds shirts now
326000	328000	Like really?
328000	330000	I thought Cut the Rope was cuter
330000	332000	Because I like the om nom nom
332000	334000	I just don't get it, I mean
334000	336000	I don't know, like
336000	338000	I've played a lot of addictive games
338000	340000	If anything, I think Plants vs. Zombies
340000	342000	Serves more of
342000	344000	You know, movie rights and that kind of stuff
344000	346000	Versus, you know, stupid
346000	348000	Angry Birds
348000	350000	I'd rather have Angry Birds shirts than
350000	352000	Farmville bottled water
352000	354000	And hot dogs, which is very real
354000	356000	At 7-Eleven, so
356000	358000	Yeah, that's a bit absurd though
358000	360000	For a casual game like that
360000	362000	And then other things I played this week
362000	364000	I just realized it's my move
364000	366000	In Words with Friends
366000	368000	Which is a much more addicting iPhone game
368000	370000	Than Angry Birds
370000	372000	I'll tell you, the only thing that pisses me off
372000	374000	About Words with Friends is people that start random games with me
374000	376000	Because I guess there's no way to like
376000	378000	Take your name out of the random game pool
378000	380000	And I'm like, I don't want to play games with people I don't know
380000	382000	You know?
382000	384000	Especially things like Scrabble
384000	386000	And then there's a chat feature in it
386000	388000	Like, you know, don't talk to me
388000	390000	My friends at work have been consumed by Words with Friends
390000	392000	So I have yet to play that
392000	394000	There was some other stuff that I played that was kind of cool
394000	398000	I've just been downloading a bunch of random things
398000	400000	I actually downloaded today
400000	402000	It was kind of cool
402000	404000	Earth Defense Force
404000	406000	Not the Earth Defense Force that I've
406000	408000	Come to love
408000	410000	But the old Earth Defense Force game
410000	412000	That was on
412000	414000	The Super Nintendo
414000	416000	Which I think came out over here
416000	418000	I want to say UN Squadron
418000	420000	I think was the name of it over here
420000	422000	Oh god, I loved UN Squadron
422000	424000	The old it?
424000	426000	That was a Capcom game years ago
426000	428000	I think that's the one
428000	430000	It looks similar, I could be wrong
430000	432000	I think it's that game
432000	434000	But then there was another one I downloaded
434000	436000	Raptor Call of Shadows
436000	438000	Which is an old shareware game
438000	440000	From way back in the day
440000	442000	From Apogee
442000	444000	So that was pretty sweet
444000	446000	So I downloaded that
446000	448000	What else did I play?
448000	450000	Funny enough I was actually playing some
450000	452000	Technically I guess it's a game
452000	454000	Because it's an app and it's
454000	456000	Questions
456000	458000	But I've been playing the
458000	460000	And I don't know why I'm obsessed with this now
460000	462000	The Mensa
462000	464000	Test quiz
464000	466000	Type stuff on there
466000	468000	Because I guess I scored pretty high on the website thing
468000	470000	So now I'm actually going to try
470000	472000	I'm a Mensa member
472000	474000	I'm really smart you guys
474000	476000	I'm not a member
476000	478000	I have to take the test
478000	480000	I can be a certified
480000	482000	Genius that way, no?
482000	484000	Ray Ayanami in our chat room says
484000	486000	Area 88 slash UN Squadron
486000	488000	NACDEF says UN Squadron does not equal
488000	490000	Earth Defense Force
490000	492000	It just looks similar
492000	496000	I know there's something else I played
496000	498000	I think I may have played a little bit of Swords and Poker
498000	500000	That's pretty fun
500000	502000	I haven't really been doing a whole ton of gaming
502000	504000	Mainly Grand Theft Auto
504000	506000	Mainly Grand Theft Auto
506000	508000	Oh, and actually I did try
508000	510000	There was a video that was out earlier this week
510000	512000	Of people playing Grand Theft Auto
512000	514000	Where they had the cars
514000	516000	Didn't really have any
516000	518000	Friction on them
518000	520000	So they just kind of went wacky
520000	522000	And started flying around
522000	524000	Everywhere and it's very chaotic
524000	526000	So I actually have my PC game set up like that
526000	528000	Right now
528000	530000	It was something I was going to be trying out
530000	532000	Even before I saw that video
532000	534000	There was this guy
534000	536000	Who goes by the name Shadow on the boards
536000	538000	That I'm on that he did that
538000	540000	And there was another mod that he did that was kind of funky
540000	542000	Like that
542000	544000	I'm actually probably going to apply those to the
544000	546000	Ballet of the Gay Tony stuff
546000	548000	We've only been playing Lost in Damned
548000	550000	So it'd be fun to
550000	552000	Add that to it
552000	554000	And then also apparently they're going to be releasing
554000	556000	Script editing tools soon
556000	560000	Which just opens up the realm of possibilities
560000	562000	For Grand Theft Auto modding to
562000	564000	All sorts of crazy lengths
564000	566000	I mean because if we have access to
566000	568000	Edit the scripts we can pretty much
568000	570000	Do whatever we want in the game
570000	572000	Which is pretty awesome so
572000	574000	I'm very excited to see what comes of that
574000	576000	That's about it
576000	578000	Alright
578000	580000	SalaciousPop how was your gaming week?
580000	582000	What kind of games did you play this week?
582000	584000	My gaming week is pretty embarrassing
584000	586000	Not much to talk about
586000	588000	Lots of wow
588000	590000	You want me to talk about that at length
590000	592000	I'll go on your other podcast
592000	594000	So just leveling up my main
594000	596000	And doing Cataclysm stuff
596000	598000	I got a 1600 point
598000	600000	Gift card for XBLA
600000	602000	And I finally used it for Christmas
602000	604000	So I finally used it and I picked up the
604000	606000	Scott Pilgrim game
606000	608000	The River City Ransom clone
608000	610000	So I tinkered with that a bit
610000	612000	And then I also used it to get
612000	614000	The Pac-Man Championship Edition DX
614000	616000	And I also
616000	618000	Have played some
618000	620000	Plants vs. Zombies
620000	622000	Game of the Year edition
622000	624000	Which was left over from the Steam sale
624000	626000	When I picked it up for like 4 bucks
626000	628000	Over Christmas and then
628000	630000	Poker Night at the inventory
630000	632000	And I'm now 60 grand in the hole
632000	634000	Again in my global stat
634000	636000	So I need to win 2 rounds
636000	638000	So that's frustrating
638000	640000	Have you unlocked everything in your Poker Night game yet?
640000	642000	I still have lots of table tops and card decks
642000	644000	To unlock, about 4 left of each
644000	646000	I know Bobby
646000	648000	The man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio
648000	650000	He talked at length tonight about
650000	652000	Back to the Future, the new Telltale
652000	654000	Game that came out. Do you have any interest in
654000	656000	Back to the Future games?
656000	658000	I haven't played any of the Sam & Max
658000	660000	And I loved the original one when it was on the
660000	662000	SCUMM engine, so all of the Telltale
662000	664000	Episodic ones, I haven't
664000	666000	Really messed with those at all
666000	668000	And there's also
668000	670000	The
670000	672000	The episodic game that I'm really looking forward to
672000	674000	Isn't Telltale, sadly, but it's the Penny Arcade one
674000	676000	Precipice of Darkness
676000	678000	On their website
678000	680000	They wrote the third volume
680000	682000	As an actual
682000	684000	Like they wrote it out like a fanfiction
684000	686000	So I guess the third one was just
686000	688000	Scrapped because they wrote it out instead
688000	690000	Like a book
690000	692000	They had the first game and the second game
692000	694000	It was kind of a back and forth thing
694000	696000	Because I remember reading some things about it
696000	698000	Where there was a joke on Twitter
698000	700000	About, you know, if so many people
700000	702000	Will buy this game when it's discounted, then we'll make the third game
702000	704000	And the Penny Arcade guys basically came out and said
704000	706000	Actually, that's not true. There's not going to be a third game
706000	708000	Basically. I don't know if it's a sales thing
708000	710000	I completely missed when that was made official
710000	712000	All this time for the last three years, I was like
712000	714000	When are we getting volume three?
714000	716000	But they just wrote it. Sorry. Oh, alright.
716000	718000	Alright, so that's all
718000	720000	Fans vs. Zombies and
720000	722000	Poker Night. It's kind of like when a show on TV
722000	724000	Gets cancelled and you can like
724000	726000	Maybe the producer will write something on the internet
726000	728000	Or you can watch the rest of the episodes
728000	730000	On CBS.com or whatever
730000	732000	When you desperately hope that they
732000	734000	Were able to squeeze out two or three
734000	736000	Episodes to wrap it up
736000	738000	After they get cancelled, it's like, no
738000	740000	The seventh episode is it. There's no closure at all
740000	742000	What was that freaking show I actually
742000	744000	Watched? I think it was
744000	746000	Harper's Island or something. It was on TV
746000	748000	It was like a murder mystery
748000	750000	Somebody dies every week and I think it got cancelled
750000	752000	By CBS like halfway through and he had to finish
752000	754000	Watching it on CBS.com
754000	756000	And it was actually
756000	758000	Not that good of a show. I don't know why I
758000	760000	Watched it every week and it had
760000	762000	Kind of a crappy, guessable ending but whatever
762000	764000	Probably the same reason we watched the Tester
764000	766000	Probably, probably. Hey
766000	768000	You know what, actually the Tester, the second
768000	770000	Season of the Tester was probably a little better
770000	772000	Than Harper's Island and less predictable
772000	774000	Sadly
774000	776000	There you go
776000	778000	All sorts of embarrassing TV shows
778000	780000	Speaking of embarrassing fandom, I will say the Telltale
780000	782000	Game I'm actually looking forward to is Jurassic Park
782000	784000	Like I'm really curious to see what they
784000	786000	Do with it. It's such a weird license
786000	788000	In some ways for them to have
788000	790000	But I'm kind of excited to see kind of what they do with it
790000	792000	Do you guys remember like the Jurassic Park games
792000	794000	From what they had on Super Nintendo
794000	796000	Remember the Super Nintendo Jurassic Park game?
796000	798000	It was all, yeah it was kind of cool
798000	800000	But at the same time it was a little
800000	802000	Bit junky, I mean
802000	804000	I remember two games that came out
804000	806000	Both platformers that were night
806000	808000	And day between the Super Nintendo
808000	810000	And Genesis versions
810000	812000	And it was completely different
812000	814000	And Aladdin, when people put on Aladdin
814000	816000	For the Genesis it's like, this is amazing
816000	818000	And Jurassic Park was the same way
818000	820000	Way better on the Genesis
820000	822000	Yeah, Jurassic Park, well I believe Jurassic Park you had to play
822000	824000	The dinosaur, it was like, wasn't that kind of
824000	826000	The trick to it? You could play the dinosaur
826000	828000	Or you could play the doctor
828000	830000	And it was kind of a cool thing
830000	832000	Super Nintendo 1 had more of like
832000	834000	A Zelda-esque overworld
834000	836000	And I use that term very loosely
836000	838000	But then when you would go into the caves
838000	840000	The dungeons were DOOM basically
840000	842000	But it was kind of like
842000	844000	You know, at that time we didn't have a lot of
844000	846000	First person shooter type games
846000	848000	And I believe it was one of the earliest games to use surround sound
848000	850000	So you know, if you had a pretty good surround system
850000	852000	That game was really kind of scary
852000	854000	You know, at least for a kid
854000	856000	Who was playing on the Super Nintendo
856000	858000	So, anyhow, we'll stop talking about
858000	860000	Games from 15 years ago
860000	862000	And talk about something a little more current
862000	864000	My Gaming Week, sadly not a lot of
864000	866000	New stuff, you know again mostly
866000	868000	Wow and My World as well
868000	870000	Still playing a little bit of Fallout 3
870000	872000	As well as some other miscellaneous things here and there
872000	874000	Not a lot of new stuff I tried out
874000	876000	I did kind of go to the Indie Store
876000	878000	And I tried a few games on the Xbox Live Indie Game Store
878000	880000	Because you know, there's some gems out there once in a while
880000	882000	You'll find some
882000	884000	And I always feel bad giving games on the Indie Store
884000	886000	Negative reviews because
886000	888000	You know, we do an independent thing here
888000	890000	And I feel like we should support other independent games
890000	892000	But sometimes there's just games
892000	894000	I really have a hard time justifying
894000	896000	And one of them is this game called
896000	898000	Maids with Balloons, have you seen this game?
898000	900000	On the Xbox Live Indie
900000	902000	Marketplace
902000	904000	I don't know how to explain it
904000	906000	It looks like a bad CD-ROM
906000	908000	Game from like when CD-ROM
908000	910000	Would first came out where they
910000	912000	Did these full motion movies
912000	914000	Or whatever and it looks like these
914000	916000	Guys who made the game rented a room
916000	918000	At Motel 6 and got their friends
918000	920000	To dress up in maid outfits
920000	922000	And just act out these scenes
922000	924000	Pay them in drinks
924000	926000	Didn't even pay them in cash
926000	928000	They got their three cute girlfriends to dress in maid outfits
928000	930000	And pay them in drinks
930000	932000	And it was like, Skidamax movies
932000	934000	Have more plot than this thing did
934000	936000	And then you go into the game itself
936000	938000	And it's like you're trying to launch balloons
938000	940000	Up at seagulls
940000	942000	So they don't poop on you
942000	944000	It's a really terrible shooter from
944000	946000	The 80s, Atari 2600 caliber
946000	948000	If someone submitted this game
948000	950000	To Newgrounds it would get blammed
950000	952000	And make it to the Flash Portal
952000	954000	It belongs on Newgrounds
954000	956000	It was funny, just how bad it was
956000	958000	And then they had the whole like pouting thing
958000	960000	At the end, oh they didn't buy the game
960000	962000	Because they don't like us or whatever
962000	964000	And I'm just thinking, wow
964000	966000	This was somebody's fantasy project
966000	968000	I can't even
968000	970000	But there's guys with maid fetishes
970000	972000	That'll have a field day with this
972000	974000	Have fun
974000	976000	I guess this is kind of a
976000	978000	Lights off, pants down kind of game for you guys
978000	980000	Anyhow, other indie games
980000	982000	That are worth much more of your time
982000	984000	For checking out was the
984000	986000	You have to help me remember the name of this game
986000	988000	It was Cthulhu Saves the World
988000	990000	Which is by the same guys that did Breath of Death
990000	992000	7
992000	994000	Which I have yet to play
994000	996000	Obviously they love their old school
996000	998000	RPGs and I mean like Dragon Warrior
998000	1000000	On the NES
1000000	1002000	Style games or you know like
1002000	1004000	Original Fantasy Star
1004000	1006000	So it's kind of like throwing back to the 8-bit days
1006000	1008000	Cthulhu Saves the World is cute because it definitely
1008000	1010000	Uses some of that tongue in cheek humor
1010000	1012000	Where as the
1012000	1014000	Narrator is talking, Cthulhu's like
1014000	1016000	I can hear you
1016000	1018000	It's kind of a cute little premise
1018000	1020000	The game itself
1020000	1022000	I don't know, like going back to
1022000	1024000	Really old games like Dragon Quest and
1024000	1026000	Fantasy Star, they feel a little more
1026000	1028000	Grind fest to me now
1028000	1030000	Than they used to
1030000	1032000	So I don't know, the game itself, they tried to do some
1032000	1034000	Neat new things with the battle system for like combo
1034000	1036000	Encounters and things like that but
1036000	1038000	Oh and the other thing I got to say I like
1038000	1040000	They had this whole system where the
1040000	1042000	Most number of random battles
1042000	1044000	You'll ever get into in a dungeon is 25
1044000	1046000	But if you want to fight
1046000	1048000	More random encounters, you can go to the main
1048000	1050000	Menu and select fight
1050000	1052000	And it's kind of like you will purposefully go into another
1052000	1054000	Random encounter fight, that's a really
1054000	1056000	Neat kind of system, like somebody really kind of thought
1056000	1058000	That one out, like how to
1058000	1060000	Make it, you remember like there'd be certain
1060000	1062000	Dungeons in Final Fantasy games
1062000	1064000	That every two steps was like walk walk
1064000	1066000	Like random battle comes in
1066000	1068000	Right and it would get really annoying
1068000	1070000	I thought that was kind of a neat way to
1070000	1072000	Make sure that it's always going to be a little bit
1072000	1074000	Consistent and not become too cumbersome
1074000	1076000	And once you hit your cap, you're done
1076000	1078000	You can just explore the cave all you want and not worry
1078000	1080000	About any more surprises
1080000	1082000	So yeah, I thought that was
1082000	1084000	It has some neat ideas, so I like
1084000	1086000	That it's trying to take that really old 8-bit
1086000	1088000	Idea and make it better
1088000	1090000	It still felt a little bit like a Grind fest
1090000	1092000	To me, but the humor in the game
1092000	1094000	Makes it, I think, a little more
1094000	1096000	Bearable and makes you kind of
1096000	1098000	Curious what joke they're going to tell next
1098000	1100000	So, and especially for the price
1100000	1102000	Because you know, indie games are very reasonably priced
1102000	1104000	240 Microsoft points, that's what, 3 bucks?
1104000	1106000	As much as you pay for something in the game room
1106000	1108000	I'd say, heck yeah, why not?
1108000	1110000	Go do it. I was really impressed by
1110000	1112000	The soundtrack in Cthulhu
1112000	1114000	Saves the World. It did have a good soundtrack. Amazing soundtrack
1114000	1116000	And yeah, it was pretty funny when he
1116000	1118000	One of the first things you do is you
1118000	1120000	Rescue sort of a damsel in distress
1120000	1122000	On the beach
1122000	1124000	And you save her and Cthulhu is like
1124000	1126000	So am I a hero now?
1126000	1128000	And the narrator's like, you're the Dark Lord of
1128000	1130000	The Eldritch, like hell no
1130000	1132000	Saving a girl isn't going to cut it
1132000	1134000	We need a little bit more from you
1134000	1136000	And that was kind of funny how it's very sarcastic
1136000	1138000	And she has a big crush on him
1138000	1140000	Yeah, she falls in love with him with his big tentacle mouth
1140000	1142000	She's like, oh you are so fine
1142000	1144000	Aren't you just waiting for the Uosugdoji scene
1144000	1146000	To come happen?
1146000	1148000	That's unpleasant
1148000	1150000	But I do want to keep playing just to see
1150000	1152000	If that happens
1152000	1154000	Although I think games on the marketplace
1154000	1156000	Can't be too adult
1156000	1158000	Although somehow this
1158000	1160000	Borderline innuendo made game
1160000	1162000	Gets on the marketplace
1162000	1164000	I mean granted, there's no titty
1164000	1166000	The game would have been ten times better
1166000	1168000	If there were boobs
1168000	1170000	There was one with titty in it
1170000	1172000	Was that the guy game?
1172000	1174000	Was that for the PS2?
1174000	1176000	On the indie games or whatever
1176000	1178000	And it was some chick or whatever
1178000	1180000	Like this guy's girlfriend
1180000	1182000	She wasn't like supermodel
1182000	1184000	It was just
1184000	1186000	Some normal chick
1186000	1188000	That they had her in lingerie
1188000	1190000	And that game got yanked
1190000	1192000	Really quick though
1192000	1194000	Unfortunately
1194000	1196000	Now that we've had maids with balloons
1196000	1198000	I'm just waiting for furries
1198000	1200000	With guns
1200000	1202000	I can't wait for there to be the furry porn game
1202000	1204000	On Xbox Live
1204000	1206000	I'm kind of surprised it hasn't hit yet
1208000	1210000	And then there could be furries with guns
1210000	1212000	Versus maids with balloons
1212000	1214000	Crazy, so there you go
1214000	1216000	By the way, I just got a text message
1216000	1218000	From Miss Dark Sakura
1218000	1220000	She's gonna be here in two hours
1220000	1222000	I don't know if she's gonna make it
1222000	1224000	She's just barely gonna hit the end of the show
1224000	1226000	If she gets here
1226000	1228000	She can do her cage match
1228000	1230000	That's not even the podcast part
1230000	1232000	Trying to think of anything else
1232000	1234000	I want to say there was one other game I had tried
1234000	1236000	Oh, the cute little arcade game
1236000	1238000	The Rascals, was that what it was called?
1238000	1240000	The skulls?
1240000	1242000	Yeah, with the skulls that was kind of like Mr. Driller
1242000	1244000	It was Mr. Driller meets
1244000	1246000	You know what it was? The Mario Brothers
1246000	1248000	Game on Game Boy Color
1248000	1250000	Did you ever play that?
1250000	1252000	Where you could link the systems
1252000	1254000	And race Mario and Luigi to beat the level
1254000	1256000	As fast as possible
1256000	1258000	Did you ever play that?
1258000	1260000	Okay, well somebody took that idea
1260000	1262000	And made like a game out of it
1262000	1264000	Where basically you race
1264000	1266000	It's a little platformer where you're trying to get
1266000	1268000	From start to finish as fast as possible
1268000	1270000	And then there's this whole Mr. Driller element
1270000	1272000	With the colored blocks that you dig through
1272000	1274000	Kind of thrown in as well
1274000	1276000	So yeah, if you're like a fan of the old school
1276000	1278000	8-bit platformer games
1278000	1280000	Especially Mario Brothers type
1280000	1282000	It's cute
1282000	1284000	Some weird
1284000	1286000	Plot devices they use
1286000	1288000	I didn't get the whole opening
1288000	1290000	With the ship and the rats
1290000	1292000	I get that they're supposed to be the antagonists
1292000	1294000	But I don't know
1294000	1296000	I think this game just needed to kind of throw me in
1296000	1298000	And start playing
1298000	1300000	I didn't need all the exposition in the beginning
1300000	1302000	It was a little weird
1302000	1304000	But the game's cute
1304000	1306000	It's definitely worth checking out the demo if you like
1306000	1308000	Either old school games or you like platformer games
1308000	1310000	You can kind of make your decision from there
1310000	1312000	Because the demo's pretty robust
1312000	1314000	So you can check that out
1314000	1316000	That's pretty much it though
1316000	1318000	For my gaming week otherwise
1318000	1320000	Not a whole lot else to report on
1320000	1322000	So I'll just talk housekeeping real quick
1322000	1324000	We are still here
1324000	1326000	Moving towards our 400th show
1326000	1328000	Set for the first week of February
1328000	1330000	We're tossing around some ideas internally
1330000	1332000	Nothing yet
1332000	1334000	I don't think it's going to be too big of a deal
1334000	1336000	We've had enough self-serving anniversary episodes
1336000	1338000	Amongst our 9 year run
1338000	1340000	We plan to do something a little bit special
1340000	1342000	Actually right now we're talking
1342000	1344000	Trying to bring back something the listeners
1344000	1346000	Have been asking for for a very long time
1346000	1348000	And I'll leave it at that
1348000	1350000	We're going to hopefully debut that back on episode 400
1350000	1352000	And I'll let you all speculate what that is
1352000	1354000	Otherwise other housekeeping things
1354000	1356000	Join us on Twitter
1356000	1358000	Twitter.com slash OLR
1358000	1360000	Or you can follow us on Facebook
1360000	1362000	At Orange Lounge Radio
1362000	1364000	How about some news
1364000	1366000	We've got a lot of it tonight
1366000	1368000	It was surprisingly a busy week
1368000	1370000	I guess now the holidays have officially
1370000	1372000	Been out and people are back at work
1372000	1374000	We're getting back into some gaming news
1374000	1376000	For what's going to happen through the summer of this year
1376000	1378000	And we start tonight with Loki
1378000	1380000	Ah yes
1380000	1382000	And speaking of people being busy
1382000	1384000	No one's been busier than Sony
1384000	1386000	And their legal team
1386000	1388000	They've been spending the week
1388000	1390000	Suing hackers
1390000	1392000	For hacking the Playstation 3
1392000	1394000	Two groups of course
1394000	1396000	That they were going after
1396000	1398000	Fail Overflow
1398000	1400000	The hacking group that
1400000	1402000	During a recent conference was talking about
1402000	1404000	How they've basically
1404000	1406000	Found all the
1406000	1408000	Public keys and were able
1408000	1410000	To fully open up
1410000	1412000	The system for
1412000	1414000	Homebrew and whatnot
1414000	1416000	And then of course
1416000	1418000	The famous in the iPhone scene
1418000	1420000	GeoHot
1420000	1422000	Or George Hot
1422000	1424000	He was the one that actually pioneered
1424000	1426000	The jailbreak for the iPhones
1426000	1428000	And um
1428000	1430000	You know later on
1430000	1432000	Went to release the keys
1432000	1434000	For the Playstation 3 hacking
1434000	1436000	Um
1436000	1438000	And yeah they're not too pleased by it
1438000	1440000	Of course
1440000	1442000	They're saying
1442000	1444000	According to the court documents
1444000	1446000	The hack violates the DMCA
1446000	1448000	And the already pirated games are being
1448000	1450000	Packaged and distributed with these
1450000	1452000	Circumvention devices
1452000	1454000	Which by the way is not true
1454000	1456000	And then
1456000	1458000	Um
1458000	1460000	Of course George Hot
1460000	1462000	Made a comment about that
1462000	1464000	I would expect the company that prides itself on intellectual property
1464000	1466000	To be well versed in the provisions
1466000	1468000	Of the law so I'm disappointed
1468000	1470000	In Sony's current action
1470000	1472000	I have spoken with legal counsel
1472000	1474000	And I'm comfortable that Sony's action against me
1474000	1476000	Doesn't have any basis
1476000	1478000	Well of course it's going to continue on from there
1478000	1480000	Um
1480000	1482000	So here's how it kind of played out this week
1482000	1484000	GeoHot on his website
1484000	1486000	Actually put the keys
1486000	1488000	Out there so people had access
1488000	1490000	To them as well as
1490000	1492000	Various signing tools
1492000	1494000	And samples of possible ways to
1494000	1496000	Install and run homebrew
1496000	1498000	Of course you know
1498000	1500000	None of this actually has anything to do with
1500000	1502000	Pirating games it's just
1502000	1504000	Installing homebrew and in fact
1504000	1506000	There are some limitations to what he's already
1506000	1508000	Released
1508000	1510000	To not allow
1510000	1512000	Pirating games
1512000	1514000	At least yet
1514000	1516000	Um
1516000	1518000	Then it's kind of funny
1518000	1520000	There's just all sorts of stuff going on
1520000	1522000	Um
1522000	1524000	Try to go a little bit more in detail here
1524000	1526000	So
1526000	1528000	There's a few funny things that are kind of going on
1528000	1530000	About this whole court case to begin with
1530000	1532000	One
1532000	1534000	Sony decided you know
1534000	1536000	To I guess
1536000	1538000	Get evidence that
1538000	1540000	Hotz was accepting money
1540000	1542000	Donations
1542000	1544000	Basically saying that oh he was charging
1544000	1546000	People for these exploits
1546000	1548000	They actually sent him a dollar to his
1548000	1550000	Paypal account Sony did
1550000	1552000	Which is kind of weird
1552000	1554000	And of course you know
1554000	1556000	Hotz's attorney they're saying
1556000	1558000	Hotz has not produced a manufacturer sold
1558000	1560000	Nor does he have
1560000	1562000	Any intent whatsoever to produce manufacturers
1562000	1564000	Sell any devices that facilitate piracy
1564000	1566000	And
1566000	1568000	They're saying that
1568000	1570000	Basically it
1570000	1572000	Dismisses Sony's
1572000	1574000	Use of piracy case
1574000	1576000	For precedent because the case
1576000	1578000	Involves hardware use to circumvent
1578000	1580000	PSC's protection not
1580000	1582000	Software
1582000	1584000	That is weird that Sony sent him a dollar
1584000	1586000	I mean I understand it was probably for the purposes of
1586000	1588000	Putting together their argument or whatever
1588000	1590000	Like they had to do it to kind of like
1590000	1592000	You know
1592000	1594000	There's a lot of weird stuff going on
1594000	1596000	In more detail where it doesn't even make any sense
1596000	1598000	Sure okay
1598000	1600000	Because the whole court case is going down in San Francisco
1600000	1602000	And you might think
1602000	1604000	Well that's you know doesn't sound
1604000	1606000	Too strange but this guy
1606000	1608000	Actually resides in New Jersey
1608000	1610000	Totally out of his jurisdiction
1610000	1612000	Yeah but Sony's in San Francisco
1612000	1614000	Aren't they?
1614000	1616000	I understand that but they're taking the case up against him
1616000	1618000	They have to do it in his jurisdiction
1618000	1620000	But their thing is basically
1620000	1622000	That he communicated on Twitter
1622000	1624000	He communicated over
1624000	1626000	You know
1626000	1628000	Using PayPal or something like that
1628000	1630000	And those two companies reside in Northern California
1630000	1632000	So therefore
1632000	1634000	Is this a copyright or trademark
1634000	1636000	Issue that they're going for?
1636000	1638000	No they're going for the fact that he released their public keys
1638000	1640000	Okay
1640000	1642000	Because I know anything to do with
1642000	1644000	With copyright or trademark
1644000	1646000	Or whatever is federal
1646000	1648000	So then you can intentionally file the
1648000	1650000	Claim out of state to make the person
1650000	1652000	Drag their ass to the court where you filed it to
1652000	1654000	Well they basically did that
1654000	1656000	Kind of
1656000	1658000	One of the comments they're saying is
1658000	1660000	I think it's quite telling that Sony
1660000	1662000	Who legally is required to provide
1662000	1664000	Notice to Mr. Hotz before seeking any special
1664000	1666000	Relief with the court decided to
1666000	1668000	Email Mr. Hotz a copy of their motion
1668000	1670000	At 7pm when a
1670000	1672000	Hearing was scheduled for the next morning at 9am
1672000	1674000	In California while Mr. Hotz doesn't
1674000	1676000	Even live in California
1676000	1678000	Sony's seeking various unreasonable reliefs
1678000	1680000	Seizing Mr. Hotz personal property
1680000	1682000	And computers
1682000	1684000	Luckily the courts postpone the hearing
1684000	1686000	And this is just
1686000	1688000	They have a bunch of comments from different law firms
1688000	1690000	Well I'm pretty sure it's just you know the big company
1690000	1692000	Exercising their big company muscle
1692000	1694000	To try and squelch out this guy
1694000	1696000	Who has very limited resources I'm sure
1696000	1698000	Even if they don't have a case they're basically saying
1698000	1700000	Hey buddy you're gonna spend money on a
1700000	1702000	Plane ticket to drag your ass out here to defend yourself
1702000	1704000	Well here's what it is
1704000	1706000	And you have to understand there's more
1706000	1708000	This is bigger than just
1708000	1710000	This a hacker
1710000	1712000	You know hacking Sony stuff
1712000	1714000	What this does is sets precedent for
1714000	1716000	A few things
1716000	1718000	There is similar cases that went on
1718000	1720000	When the whole jail breaking
1720000	1722000	Of the iPhone thing happened
1722000	1724000	And that actually
1724000	1726000	Was overturned in courts and now it is
1726000	1728000	Legal to jail break
1728000	1730000	Your phone because of that
1730000	1732000	Court case well this
1732000	1734000	Interesting comparison I never thought
1734000	1736000	Of that sorry I just had to get that out there but I didn't
1736000	1738000	Realize you're right
1738000	1740000	What this story is is very similar
1740000	1742000	To the whole jail breaking your iPhone
1742000	1744000	It's using your device not the way
1744000	1746000	The company intended but not necessarily
1746000	1748000	It's even going beyond that
1748000	1750000	The whole thing is
1750000	1752000	Remember when you buy these consoles
1752000	1754000	In their end user license agreement
1754000	1756000	It's basically making it seem like
1756000	1758000	You're leasing this property
1758000	1760000	That is Sony's and they're
1760000	1762000	Paying a fee to basically lease it
1762000	1764000	So literally it's their property but it's in your home
1764000	1766000	This would actually set precedent
1766000	1768000	That this is your console
1768000	1770000	You can do whatever the fuck you want with it
1770000	1772000	If he ends up winning this case
1772000	1774000	Is what it's going to come down to
1774000	1776000	I wonder how that would impact the next generation
1776000	1778000	Of games and the reason why I say that
1778000	1780000	Is that you know why that's in there is because
1780000	1782000	Companies take a big loss
1782000	1784000	On their consoles
1784000	1786000	Even when the Playstation 3 came out for
1786000	1788000	What was it $700 when it first came out
1788000	1790000	Sony was still taking a loss on those consoles
1790000	1792000	Usually the manufacturers put out
1792000	1794000	The consoles at a loss
1794000	1796000	Unless you're the Wii
1796000	1798000	Was the one console that they weren't taking a loss on
1798000	1800000	But all these other consoles they take a loss
1800000	1802000	Because they make the money back from the games
1802000	1804000	That are sold and all the licensing that comes from that
1804000	1806000	So if somehow
1806000	1808000	If suddenly this thing is unlocked
1808000	1810000	That you don't have to pay for games anymore
1810000	1812000	Then this company is consistently
1812000	1814000	Losing money every time a console is sold
1814000	1816000	So it's going to be interesting that the courts
1816000	1818000	Come in and say well
1818000	1820000	Obviously it is just like the jailbroken iPhones
1820000	1822000	You can use these consoles for whatever you want
1822000	1824000	Is that going to drive the price
1824000	1826000	Way up of the next series of consoles
1826000	1828000	I don't think they can do that
1828000	1830000	Well I mean they can do that obviously
1830000	1832000	But I don't think it would be smart for them to do that regardless
1832000	1834000	Because a lot of people don't have the know-how
1834000	1836000	To do this
1836000	1838000	Although
1838000	1840000	He went on G4
1840000	1842000	And made a comment about what the whole case was going on
1842000	1844000	He doesn't feel that he's
1844000	1846000	In the wrong
1846000	1848000	Obviously and
1848000	1850000	It's basically as simple as right now
1850000	1852000	If your console is not to the latest
1852000	1854000	Firmware all you have to do is
1854000	1856000	Download a firmware update that's on his website
1856000	1858000	And you can immediately download
1858000	1860000	That firmware, update your console
1860000	1862000	And boom there it is right there
1862000	1864000	The ability to install Homebrew
1864000	1866000	And that's on any console that's out there right now
1866000	1868000	And it's just, it's ridiculous
1868000	1870000	A few other things
1870000	1872000	Real quick
1872000	1874000	Can I read some comments from chat because obviously
1874000	1876000	This is a very un-passionate issue
1876000	1878000	And some folks in the chat room are kind of lighting up about this
1878000	1880000	Nick Gertz in our chat room
1880000	1882000	I don't recognize that name so welcome if it's your first time
1882000	1884000	And our chat room says BS once you buy something it's yours
1884000	1886000	You should be able to do whatever the fuck you want
1886000	1888000	With what you own
1888000	1890000	Read the end user license agreement
1890000	1892000	You may think that and you may feel that
1892000	1894000	And I agree it should be the case
1894000	1896000	But that's not what they're saying
1896000	1898000	That's why they're able to patch your
1898000	1900000	PlayStation 3 to remove the other operating system
1900000	1902000	And all that stuff
1902000	1904000	I definitely agree with Nick
1904000	1906000	That's going to be very interesting
1906000	1908000	And then SSJ100Matt in our chat room says
1908000	1910000	Can't blame Sony for protecting its properties
1910000	1912000	I think they sort of have an obligation to
1912000	1914000	Because of
1914000	1916000	That agreement that they have with developers
1916000	1918000	That there's all these other companies
1918000	1920000	That if this whole thing ends up going
1920000	1922000	Against Sony
1922000	1924000	They have an interest in that too
1924000	1926000	Here's the problem though
1926000	1928000	This may be Sony's
1928000	1930000	Big
1930000	1932000	Weakness in this case
1932000	1934000	Is that they're saying that this
1934000	1936000	Enables piracy
1936000	1938000	It hasn't enabled piracy yet
1938000	1940000	This is not something that's
1940000	1942000	Well that's true but we're talking now
1942000	1944000	We're not talking about in the future
1944000	1946000	That's stupid
1946000	1948000	Should Sony have waited and
1948000	1950000	Tell piracy was a factor?
1950000	1952000	Here's the other thing too
1952000	1954000	Geohot has only released
1954000	1956000	And this is all speculation
1956000	1958000	He's only released a portion
1958000	1960000	Of the key
1960000	1962000	Basically he has a
1962000	1964000	A key for signing these applications
1964000	1966000	That you create in homebrew
1966000	1968000	It's one key though
1968000	1970000	There's a key generator though
1970000	1972000	That they have to generate these keys
1972000	1974000	That can be used to sign these different applications
1974000	1976000	But he hasn't released a generator
1976000	1978000	He's only released a single key
1978000	1980000	So in theory Sony could just ban that key
1980000	1982000	And all the homebrew stuff wouldn't work anymore
1982000	1984000	But he's smart you see
1984000	1986000	Because he's hoping this court case
1986000	1988000	In favor, if that's the case
1988000	1990000	Then it'll be legal for him to release that key
1990000	1992000	And it's over, it's done
1992000	1994000	There's nothing they can do
1994000	1996000	Once that's out there, there is no way to block that
1996000	1998000	Anymore, they're done
1998000	2000000	It's over
2000000	2002000	SalaciousPop you want to say something and then I'll go to more chat comments
2002000	2004000	Yeah this is really just about
2004000	2006000	Opening up additional functionality
2006000	2008000	On a console that you own
2008000	2010000	If it was some type of hack
2010000	2012000	Where I don't know you could pull games
2012000	2014000	Down from the Playstation network
2014000	2016000	Or that was a demo
2016000	2018000	And unlock it
2018000	2020000	Completely different thing I'm talking about here
2020000	2022000	Where you could then play the full version of the game without paying for it
2022000	2024000	Then yes, that's something that would hurt the developer
2024000	2026000	But that's completely different
2026000	2028000	That's not what we're dealing with here
2028000	2030000	It's just opening up the console for
2030000	2032000	Homebrew and whatever else
2032000	2034000	Now granted everyone doesn't necessarily share
2034000	2036000	That same ideal
2036000	2038000	There's people out there that's like
2038000	2040000	Okay how can I use this, the pirate stuff
2040000	2042000	Oh yeah
2042000	2044000	This is one hacker they're going after
2044000	2046000	This is not the whole hacking community
2046000	2048000	It's one guy
2048000	2050000	He's not going for piracy
2050000	2052000	So the fact that they're saying
2052000	2054000	He's releasing tools to
2054000	2056000	Enable piracy
2056000	2058000	Yeah in the long run maybe
2058000	2060000	But you could say
2060000	2062000	Well you release the console that enables piracy
2062000	2064000	Because eventually
2064000	2066000	There will be piracy on it
2066000	2068000	And just think if they would have just kept Linux on the damn system
2068000	2070000	Maybe people wouldn't have gone here
2070000	2072000	I'm convinced that most of the hardcore people
2072000	2074000	In the crypto and DRM
2074000	2076000	Communities that love breaking that stuff
2076000	2078000	Don't even play games
2078000	2080000	They're like this is an awesome thing
2080000	2082000	It's got awesome DRM on it, I want to break it
2082000	2084000	Because that's fun as hell
2084000	2086000	It's funny they're asking him
2086000	2088000	So what's something
2088000	2090000	Once this whole PS3 thing is done
2090000	2092000	What's your next thing, what are you going to move on to next
2092000	2094000	What's your next
2094000	2096000	Because he stopped doing the iPhone stuff
2096000	2098000	Because he got bored with it
2098000	2100000	That's all it was
2100000	2102000	And this guy he's like 21 years old
2102000	2104000	21 year old
2104000	2106000	And so he got bored with
2106000	2108000	Whatever it was and he's like
2108000	2110000	Well I hear the PSP2 is coming out
2112000	2114000	Let me go to the other comments from chatroom
2114000	2116000	Chat.orangelandrater.com
2116000	2118000	DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says
2118000	2120000	Can I put end user license agreements on other things in life
2120000	2122000	Like the door to my house
2122000	2124000	Maybe
2124000	2126000	SpazinatorPC says
2126000	2128000	If I ever mess with my system
2128000	2130000	I'd be too afraid of bricking it
2130000	2132000	Thus losing my video content that I bought
2132000	2134000	That's kind of where I'm at
2134000	2136000	A little bit
2136000	2138000	I really don't have a good reason
2138000	2140000	To hack my system
2140000	2142000	Me personally
2142000	2144000	Because I don't really want to
2144000	2146000	Pirate everything
2146000	2148000	I don't know
2148000	2150000	There's limits and I think that's a bit much
2150000	2152000	Then we won't have games anymore
2152000	2154000	If everybody goes batshit crazy about pirating
2154000	2156000	But you know
2156000	2158000	I don't know I'd be afraid
2158000	2160000	Of some of this other stuff
2160000	2162000	Of just screwing my console
2162000	2164000	Especially 360
2164000	2166000	I have lots of XPLA games I've bought
2166000	2168000	Like over 100
2168000	2170000	It's pretty disgusting
2170000	2172000	Of course I've had my console for 4 or 5 years now
2172000	2174000	Yeah I don't want to lose that
2174000	2176000	So I'm afraid to do anything that might even
2176000	2178000	Get my console banned or lose me access
2178000	2180000	To all that crap you know what I mean
2180000	2182000	I haven't been into
2182000	2184000	Chipping or modding systems since the PS1
2184000	2186000	And the Dreamcast
2186000	2188000	After that era I stopped
2188000	2190000	Doesn't mean I'm not still interested in that community
2190000	2192000	But just as far as
2192000	2194000	The consoles have just gotten too expensive
2194000	2196000	For me to open it up
2196000	2198000	I'm not a whiz with a soldering iron
2198000	2200000	As I once was so I'd probably brick the hell out of it
2200000	2202000	But yeah
2202000	2204000	I find these stories really interesting
2204000	2206000	But I haven't been into modding or any of that stuff in a while
2206000	2208000	I would say I would support
2208000	2210000	Trying to get around region locking
2210000	2212000	And that kind of made me think about that
2212000	2214000	Ray Iannami says I could have hacked my US 360
2214000	2216000	Then I would have had to get a Japanese one
2216000	2218000	Or then I wouldn't have had to get a Japanese one
2218000	2220000	And that kind of made me think you know yeah
2220000	2222000	Getting around region locking I think
2222000	2224000	I don't understand region locking
2224000	2226000	I do
2226000	2228000	I understand why they do it
2228000	2230000	That doesn't mean I support it
2230000	2232000	I know it's coming up later in the show
2232000	2234000	Let's not forget
2234000	2236000	And I know somebody is going to say it if I don't
2236000	2238000	PS3 of course is not region locked
2238000	2240000	That's good though
2240000	2242000	Here's what comes down to it
2242000	2244000	I think that when you
2244000	2246000	Remove functionality like that
2246000	2248000	It's not even necessarily removing it because a lot of the consoles in the past
2248000	2250000	Did not have, they weren't region free
2250000	2252000	But nonetheless
2252000	2254000	If you remove
2254000	2256000	Or do not have features like it being
2256000	2258000	Region free
2258000	2260000	I think if it wasn't region free
2260000	2262000	That'd give more people motivation to try to hack it
2262000	2264000	To make it region free
2264000	2266000	Just like we're going to get into another system
2266000	2268000	That's region free
2268000	2270000	I really
2270000	2272000	You don't want to give them more
2272000	2274000	Excuses to try to hack your system
2274000	2276000	And in the PS3 actually
2276000	2278000	I think that's why it's taken so long
2278000	2280000	It's because it had Linux enabled on it
2280000	2282000	From the beginning
2282000	2284000	And it was region free
2284000	2286000	Why do you need to hack the system?
2286000	2288000	Because most people are trying to install homebrew
2288000	2290000	Or play stuff from other regions
2290000	2292000	So it's all there
2292000	2294000	Well they didn't remove the region locking
2294000	2296000	They removed Linux
2296000	2298000	And once they removed Linux
2298000	2300000	People took interest in trying to get that back
2300000	2302000	Because people don't like things
2302000	2304000	That are taken away from them
2304000	2306000	I just want to throw it out there
2306000	2308000	If the Wii wasn't region locked
2308000	2310000	We could have totally made President and Cat sell more than 100 copies
2310000	2312000	Just saying
2312000	2314000	If you remember that whole debacle from like 2 years ago
2314000	2316000	2 years ago?
2316000	2318000	It's about at least a year and a half
2318000	2320000	Not 2 years ago
2320000	2322000	It was a while
2322000	2324000	I found it interesting that dude was on
2324000	2326000	Attack of the show and all this stuff
2326000	2328000	He's become this e-list celebrity now
2328000	2330000	He's big in the
2330000	2332000	Iphone community
2332000	2334000	He came up with the jailbreak stuff
2334000	2336000	That's pretty big
2336000	2338000	Alright
2338000	2340000	Let me go to some other stories here
2340000	2342000	Kind of getting into other
2342000	2344000	Legal-ish type of things
2344000	2346000	Although I don't think this is going to end up being a lawsuit
2346000	2348000	There was this whole back and forth
2348000	2350000	Between Capcom Mobile
2350000	2352000	This week and the folks that made
2352000	2354000	Explosion Man
2354000	2356000	Twisted Pixel
2356000	2358000	And it has to do with the game Maxplosion
2358000	2360000	Which came out for the Iphone
2360000	2362000	Which of course was released to iTunes
2362000	2364000	Very similar to Explosion Man
2364000	2366000	Both feature Little Red Demons
2366000	2368000	Kind of running around
2368000	2370000	They're even similar names
2370000	2372000	Doing similar things
2372000	2374000	Yeah
2374000	2376000	Capcom Mobile took a little bit of heat this week
2376000	2378000	For doing that
2378000	2380000	So much that the Twisted Pixel programmer
2380000	2382000	Mike Henry on his Twitter account said
2382000	2384000	Quote, Maxplosion gameplay
2384000	2386000	Video makes me sad
2386000	2388000	If you're going to outright steal a game
2388000	2390000	You should at least understand what makes it fun
2390000	2392000	Another note to this is that Twisted Pixel
2392000	2394000	Had actually once met with Capcom
2394000	2396000	About getting them to distribute
2396000	2398000	Explosion Man
2398000	2400000	Capcom passed
2400000	2402000	So for them to do something like this was especially insulting
2402000	2404000	Well Capcom had to put out some fires of their own
2404000	2406000	They of course were
2406000	2408000	Sadened by the whole situation
2408000	2410000	Let me tell you how sad in this little statement
2410000	2412000	Quote, while Twisted Pixel did have
2412000	2414000	Discussions with our console game team
2414000	2416000	About publishing Explosion Man on game consoles
2416000	2418000	Capcom Mobile is a different division
2418000	2420000	Of Capcom with separate offices
2420000	2422000	And as such had no prior knowledge
2422000	2424000	Of any meetings between the console game team
2424000	2426000	And Twisted Pixel
2426000	2428000	Maxplosion was developed independently by Capcom Mobile
2428000	2430000	Nonetheless we are saddened by this
2430000	2432000	Situation and hope to rebuild the trust
2432000	2434000	Of our fans and friends
2434000	2436000	In the gaming community
2436000	2438000	We're sorry
2438000	2440000	We're sorry
2440000	2442000	I like how it completely dodges the fact
2442000	2444000	That the game is a total
2444000	2446000	You know, I don't want to say rip off
2446000	2448000	But heavily influenced
2448000	2450000	By Explosion Man
2450000	2452000	You know what I mean?
2452000	2454000	That press release totally dodges
2454000	2456000	That part of it
2456000	2458000	Well Capcom Mobile, they have different employees
2458000	2460000	And they're in a different building
2460000	2462000	Than Capcom
2462000	2464000	They wouldn't work with Capcom console people
2464000	2466000	At all, I mean god
2466000	2468000	They wouldn't be working with those teams
2468000	2470000	When they port over their crappy ports of games
2470000	2472000	Onto the iPhone or whatever
2472000	2474000	Thank you for Dead Rising with four zombies in it
2474000	2476000	So you're telling me
2476000	2478000	That these people have no communication
2478000	2480000	That's like the whole Coke Zero
2480000	2482000	Coke thing
2482000	2484000	I think people are reading
2484000	2486000	A little too much into what Twisted Pixel said
2486000	2488000	Believe it or not
2488000	2490000	I believe Capcom
2490000	2492000	I think a lot of times these big companies
2492000	2494000	Especially international companies
2494000	2496000	Tend to work in little silos
2496000	2498000	And I don't think
2498000	2500000	That the Capcom division said one to another
2500000	2502000	Hey, we got presented this little game
2502000	2504000	You guys should try it
2504000	2506000	I don't think that ever happened
2506000	2508000	Here's what I think did happen
2508000	2510000	Explosion Man's been out for a good six months now
2510000	2512000	I think some people in the mobile division played it
2512000	2514000	And said we want to do a game like this on the iPhone
2514000	2516000	I honestly don't think
2516000	2518000	It was ever one of those
2518000	2520000	Don't make it shadier than it already is shady
2520000	2522000	You know what I mean?
2522000	2524000	But let's face it folks
2524000	2526000	I look at this and I go
2526000	2528000	This is news, really
2528000	2530000	Games ripping each other off
2530000	2532000	That's been happening forever
2532000	2534000	And especially on the iPhone
2534000	2536000	Hello Gameloft
2536000	2538000	I mean, ironically enough
2538000	2540000	Street Fighter 2
2540000	2542000	How many times was that game ripped off?
2542000	2544000	It got a lot of shoddy ports done to it
2544000	2546000	This show started
2546000	2548000	Then a game came out called In the Groove
2548000	2550000	And there was much heated debate
2550000	2552000	About what a ripoff In the Groove was
2552000	2554000	Games biting from one another
2554000	2556000	Happen all the time
2556000	2558000	It happens in movies too, you guys
2558000	2560000	A lot of movies are ripoffs of one another
2560000	2562000	It's not that surprising
2562000	2564000	It's up to the gamers
2564000	2566000	To reject the crap
2566000	2568000	And if you think that this is
2568000	2570000	A crappy derivative of Explosion Man
2570000	2572000	Don't buy it
2572000	2574000	Don't support the ripoff
2574000	2576000	Don't buy it
2576000	2578000	It's cute, I guess, in some ways
2578000	2580000	That Capcom's being called out on this
2580000	2582000	But I really don't think Capcom's alone
2582000	2584000	In what they're doing
2584000	2586000	I think every game company out there is guilty of doing it at some point
2586000	2588000	Name me a company
2588000	2590000	I'm sure there's a ripoff game they've done at some point
2594000	2596000	I can't think of any
2596000	2598000	Anyway
2598000	2600000	I'm not taking that literally
2600000	2602000	I'm not trying to profess to be this encyclopedia
2602000	2604000	But I'm sure most big companies
2604000	2606000	At one point or another
2606000	2608000	Have ripped off another game
2608000	2610000	Or allowed a game to heavily influence
2610000	2612000	What they're doing
2612000	2614000	And yeah, some comments from our chatroom here
2614000	2616000	Darktitsia says Great Gianna Sisters
2616000	2618000	Well, you know
2618000	2620000	That ended up getting pulled from shelves
2620000	2622000	So I was a little too close
2622000	2624000	And it's coming out in DS in February
2624000	2626000	Yeah, but it's all different now
2626000	2628000	One of the great things about Great Gianna Sisters
2628000	2630000	Actually, if you want to go way back
2630000	2632000	Great Gianna Sisters was a game
2632000	2634000	That came out for
2634000	2636000	The Commodore 64
2636000	2638000	And it really looked and felt like Mario
2638000	2640000	Especially like the first level
2640000	2642000	Blue sky
2642000	2644000	Bricks on the ground
2644000	2646000	Goomba looking monsters
2646000	2648000	Bricks that turned into coins
2648000	2650000	I mean, damn
2650000	2652000	It was really, really just like Mario
2652000	2654000	Little power-ups that make you get bigger
2654000	2656000	It really was pretty much a Mario Brothers ripoff
2656000	2658000	Ironically enough, when you get into later levels
2658000	2660000	There are some kind of different mechanics
2660000	2662000	That do set the game apart a little bit
2662000	2664000	But here's the thing
2664000	2666000	The reason why people remember that game so fondly
2666000	2668000	It wasn't necessarily the game itself
2668000	2670000	But it had a kick-ass soundtrack
2670000	2672000	If you've ever heard the soundtrack to Great Gianna Sisters
2672000	2674000	And a lot of the Commodore 64 music
2674000	2676000	You still hear that influence today
2676000	2678000	I mean, Chiptune, bit music
2678000	2680000	All of it is influenced by Commodore 64 stuff
2680000	2682000	All of it
2682000	2684000	And so there was such great music
2684000	2686000	That came out of that Commodore 64 era
2686000	2688000	Great Gianna Sisters I think is fondly remembered
2688000	2690000	Because, yeah, it was a ripoff of a game
2690000	2692000	It had an awesome soundtrack
2692000	2694000	Dark Tetsuya also brings up Casey Munchkin
2694000	2696000	Which was an Odyssey game
2696000	2698000	That was a total ripoff of Pac-Man
2698000	2700000	Game Guru says
2700000	2702000	Capcom even sued for Fighter's History
2702000	2704000	But that time they lost
2704000	2706000	It's kind of interesting what games are considered too close
2706000	2708000	And what games aren't
2708000	2710000	ActDeft, by the way, in our chatroom
2710000	2712000	Says, Loki, I know a guy that works at Gameloft
2712000	2714000	He pretty much has told some friends
2714000	2716000	And me that they pretty much ripoff games
2716000	2718000	And just make some cosmetic changes
2718000	2720000	Gameloft had a Castlevania Symphony of the Night ripoff
2720000	2722000	They were going to release a few years ago
2722000	2724000	But they cancelled it
2724000	2726000	But here's the thing, though
2726000	2728000	But, you know
2728000	2730000	To Gameloft's credit
2730000	2732000	Some of their games are actually pretty good
2732000	2734000	I mean, granted, they're not the most original thing
2734000	2736000	But damn, you know
2736000	2738000	For what it's running on
2738000	2740000	It's pretty good
2740000	2742000	Problem is, when they go to
2742000	2744000	Develop on consoles
2744000	2746000	They don't really learn that, okay
2746000	2748000	I can't put out a
2748000	2750000	Well, you can put out a Modern Warfare 2
2750000	2752000	Clone, but
2752000	2754000	No one's going to give a shit
2754000	2756000	Because it's on consoles now
2756000	2758000	It's not as impressive as making it run on the
2758000	2760000	You know, iPhone or whatever
2760000	2762000	But yeah, their boards, I mean, or whatever
2762000	2764000	Aren't, they aren't terrible
2764000	2766000	I mean, I haven't played all of them
2766000	2768000	But
2768000	2770000	They look, compared to like
2770000	2772000	Hungry bird clones and stuff like that
2772000	2774000	It could be a lot worse
2774000	2776000	Funny enough, if Gameloft had put out
2776000	2778000	A version of Splosion Man, do you think it would've
2778000	2780000	Necessitated all these stories on Gamelogs
2780000	2782000	This week? Nope
2782000	2784000	It was funny, though, because they did have
2784000	2786000	A story, they didn't make our show roll
2786000	2788000	But Gameloft was saying
2788000	2790000	We don't rip games off
2790000	2792000	There's just a limited amount of genres
2792000	2794000	That we can use, so a lot of games
2794000	2796000	Look similar
2796000	2798000	No
2798000	2800000	I'm sorry, that is a bunch of shit
2800000	2802000	Do you know why this, I think, got
2802000	2804000	Traction and is all over the news?
2804000	2806000	Because it's Capcom, and they expect better from Capcom
2806000	2808000	Exactly, because Capcom, I think
2808000	2810000	Has always been seen as, they're one of us
2810000	2812000	They're friends with the community
2812000	2814000	They're letting the people
2814000	2816000	Design Mega Man Legends 3, they're the
2816000	2818000	Good guys. I'd expect better from Capcom
2818000	2820000	The console
2820000	2822000	Game manufacturer
2822000	2824000	Capcom Mobile, their stuff
2824000	2826000	Is shit. That's true, the Mega Man game
2826000	2828000	On iPhone, shit. Absolute shit
2828000	2830000	Dead Rising, terrible
2830000	2832000	Devil May Cry
2832000	2834000	I haven't actually played it yet
2834000	2836000	But I'm sorry, it probably won't be good
2836000	2838000	So
2838000	2840000	No, I don't expect much better from
2840000	2842000	Capcom Mobile
2842000	2844000	Now Capcom, though, if they actually put out an
2844000	2846000	Xbox Live Arcade game of Maxplosion
2846000	2848000	Then I'd be a little sad
2848000	2850000	Now you're acknowledging that they're separate divisions
2850000	2852000	This is what I'm saying
2852000	2854000	Well, it's their words
2854000	2856000	I don't think they're talking
2856000	2858000	To each other, to this extent
2858000	2860000	I don't think it's some mass conspiracy
2860000	2862000	The steel explosion, man
2862000	2864000	It's not anything like that
2864000	2866000	It's just
2866000	2868000	It's supposed to make crappy
2868000	2870000	Games in their mobile department
2870000	2872000	What can I say?
2872000	2874000	Alright, let's move on
2874000	2876000	Who's accusing who of ripping
2876000	2878000	Someone off next? And we'll go to another news
2878000	2880000	Story from Salacious Pop
2880000	2882000	Champions Online
2882000	2884000	Which came out in September
2884000	2886000	Of 09, some
2886000	2888000	Brief 15-16 months ago
2888000	2890000	Is going free to play
2890000	2892000	I think Lord of the Rings Online
2892000	2894000	Was the most recent major MMO to do this
2894000	2896000	Champions Online
2896000	2898000	Will be going free to play starting
2898000	2900000	January 25th
2900000	2902000	You can download the client and
2902000	2904000	Create your superhero or your villain
2904000	2906000	And go along your crime fighting way
2906000	2908000	When it gets relaunched
2908000	2910000	On the 25th
2910000	2912000	Getting a new title
2912000	2914000	Champions Online Free-for-All
2914000	2916000	Which sounds like it might be an expansion
2916000	2918000	But that's just what they're rebranding it
2918000	2920000	For the free-to-play model
2920000	2922000	This story is kind of
2924000	2926000	Important to me simply because I
2926000	2928000	Was a huge
2928000	2930000	I was hugely cuckoo bananas over City of Heroes
2930000	2932000	Played that for three years
2932000	2934000	And the team within Cryptic
2934000	2936000	Studios that was working on City of Heroes
2936000	2938000	Was spun off to
2938000	2940000	Paragon Studios which is now its own thing
2940000	2942000	Just for City of Heroes
2942000	2944000	Because Cryptic got the Champions Online license
2944000	2946000	And it was going to be the first
2946000	2948000	MMO that had
2948000	2950000	PC and Xbox
2950000	2952000	360 support
2952000	2954000	Where you could have an account
2954000	2956000	That worked on both
2956000	2958000	Platforms
2958000	2960000	And a month or two before release
2960000	2962000	Microsoft pulled the plug
2962000	2964000	On the Xbox Live component
2964000	2966000	Of the MMO
2966000	2968000	When they launched they already had
2968000	2970000	Potentially 50% of
2970000	2972000	Their game base taken away from them
2972000	2974000	It became PC only
2974000	2976000	And it floundered, it never really took off
2976000	2978000	It kind of flopped actually
2978000	2980000	So this isn't surprising to me at all
2980000	2982000	I'm surprised that they're actually going free-to-play
2982000	2984000	For me it would seem
2984000	2986000	That now they would be able to bring it
2986000	2988000	To Xbox Live
2988000	2990000	Because before they had
2990000	2992000	For some reason the infrastructure with
2992000	2994000	MMOs and stuff and subscriptions
2994000	2996000	Couldn't do it
2996000	2998000	I'm sorry but I call bullshit on Microsoft
2998000	3000000	Final Fantasy XI came out like
3000000	3002000	Six months after the Xbox was out
3002000	3004000	They were able to do this shit for years
3004000	3006000	Well then why haven't there been any MMOs on the console yet?
3006000	3008000	That's a damn good question
3008000	3010000	One I think Microsoft needs to answer
3010000	3012000	Final Fantasy XI did this shit
3012000	3014000	It was PC and 360 and
3014000	3016000	PlayStation 2 for fuck's sake
3016000	3018000	You know why I don't think there's been any MMOs?
3018000	3020000	Because there haven't really been any MMOs on consoles yet
3020000	3022000	But now
3022000	3024000	Sony releasing like DC Universe
3024000	3026000	And they're going to have the agency some year
3026000	3028000	Final Fantasy XIV
3030000	3032000	Well eventually Final Fantasy XIV
3032000	3034000	But if that stuff takes off
3034000	3036000	They're going to have to compete
3036000	3038000	But right now they had the MMO
3038000	3040000	Sony didn't have anything
3040000	3042000	And so now
3042000	3044000	Final Fantasy XI I don't think did too well
3044000	3046000	For them on 360
3046000	3048000	Because it had already been out
3048000	3050000	It's hard to just
3050000	3052000	The audience that would have been attracted
3052000	3054000	To Final Fantasy XI already had it
3054000	3056000	On the PlayStation 2 or on the PC
3056000	3058000	There were just very few
3058000	3060000	You know as Salacious Pop says
3060000	3062000	Cuckoo Bananas nerds for that game
3062000	3064000	Like me and like you Loki
3064000	3066000	That bought it
3066000	3068000	Because we had the PC version
3068000	3070000	But sometimes we wanted to play it on our TV
3070000	3072000	It did look really good on the TV
3072000	3074000	I'm not going to lie
3074000	3076000	Like if I was still into playing Final Fantasy XI
3076000	3078000	I'd probably be playing it on the 360
3078000	3080000	Home where I just live by myself now
3080000	3082000	And I could be using my TV as a giant computer
3082000	3084000	Like that I would totally be playing Final Fantasy XI
3084000	3086000	On the Xbox 360 if I was still
3086000	3088000	Playing that game
3088000	3090000	It, it, it
3090000	3092000	You know if that game went free to play
3092000	3094000	Yeah I got to admit if Final Fantasy XI
3094000	3096000	Went free to play I'd go back
3096000	3098000	I'd go back and if all my characters were still there
3098000	3100000	I'd be on like that I would download the client
3100000	3102000	I'd be on tomorrow I would
3102000	3104000	Not going to lie
3104000	3106000	That's scary, that's a scary thought
3106000	3108000	If you did that, bye bye 14
3108000	3110000	It doesn't even matter, don't even release it
3110000	3112000	Just forget it, just don't even worry about it
3112000	3114000	Just finish, keep adding to XI
3114000	3116000	When I tried to play
3116000	3118000	When I tried to play Champions Online last year
3118000	3120000	For like the free, when they
3120000	3122000	Because they came out with a free trial
3122000	3124000	Really relatively soon after the release
3124000	3126000	Because it was a flop
3126000	3128000	I was doing the City of Heroes
3128000	3130000	Thing playing with the controller and mouse
3130000	3132000	Or not controller, with the keyboard and mouse
3132000	3134000	Didn't like it, plugged in my
3134000	3136000	Xbox 360 controller
3136000	3138000	And all of a sudden all of the buttons
3138000	3140000	And the configuration for the controller, the integration
3140000	3142000	Was amazing, so you knew that
3142000	3144000	When this game came out
3144000	3146000	It had full, like it was ready to come out
3146000	3148000	On the Xbox, and even on the PC
3148000	3150000	Version you plug in an Xbox controller
3150000	3152000	And you can see how much better the game
3152000	3154000	Is with an Xbox controller
3154000	3156000	That's kind of how I feel about DC Universe
3156000	3158000	Ironically enough these two games somewhat similar
3158000	3160000	In the whole like super hero in the making thing
3160000	3162000	I wonder if this happening
3162000	3164000	Is somewhat of a response to DC Universe
3164000	3166000	Kind of now entering the market
3166000	3168000	And you know, it seems like quite a few
3168000	3170000	People are kind of jumping on board
3170000	3172000	And having played the beta test of the PC
3172000	3174000	Version of DC Universe, man
3174000	3176000	It was so much better when I plugged in the controller
3176000	3178000	And did it that way
3178000	3180000	So you know, you download the client
3180000	3182000	And you create your free account, you can play
3182000	3184000	It's
3184000	3186000	It's adopting
3186000	3188000	Sort of a freemium model
3188000	3190000	Where if you want to pay for the additional
3190000	3192000	Costume packs, or the weapons
3192000	3194000	Or powers
3194000	3196000	Or whatever, you can
3196000	3198000	Pay a la carte for that
3198000	3200000	However, if you're into the game enough
3200000	3202000	That you're willing to pay a $14.99
3202000	3204000	Subscription, which is what it is right now
3204000	3206000	You will automatically get that stuff as soon as
3206000	3208000	It's available, you'll have everything
3208000	3210000	So they're still offering
3210000	3212000	A subscription based
3212000	3214000	Service for people that
3214000	3216000	Are into the game enough that they want all the goodies
3216000	3218000	Or you can just play it
3218000	3220000	You know, run
3220000	3222000	Have it run with your WoW account
3222000	3224000	Do the, if you see one particular
3224000	3226000	Expansion that you like, pay for it a la carte
3226000	3228000	And otherwise it's free
3228000	3230000	So yeah, hopefully
3230000	3232000	This will help the game out, because I really like the
3232000	3234000	Superhero genre
3234000	3236000	And this game, I feel, never really got
3236000	3238000	A chance to succeed
3238000	3240000	Because of what Microsoft did too
3240000	3242000	Speaking of the superhero genre
3242000	3244000	Do you have any interest in DC Universe Online
3244000	3248000	That it's out?
3248000	3250000	This is gonna sound, I don't know if this is
3250000	3252000	Pretentious or what, but just the fact that it's DC
3252000	3254000	Like if Marvel came out with an MMO
3254000	3256000	I'd feel the same way
3256000	3258000	I just don't like the big names, I like the
3258000	3260000	Because City of Heroes has a huge
3260000	3262000	RP community in it, because it's so
3262000	3264000	Customizable
3264000	3266000	And it's not attached to any known
3266000	3268000	License, like DC is
3268000	3270000	But yeah, I'm gonna check this out now, now that it's free to play
3270000	3272000	Champions Online, absolutely, I'm gonna get it
3272000	3274000	Well you'll have to come back
3274000	3276000	And let us know how it is
3276000	3278000	Yes
3278000	3280000	Let's move on
3280000	3282000	So it's no surprise
3282000	3284000	That one of the best games
3284000	3286000	To be released for the Kinect
3286000	3288000	Has sold 1 million units in the US
3288000	3290000	That would be Dance Central
3290000	3292000	And also Kinect Sports
3292000	3294000	Both those games breaking the
3294000	3296000	1 million unit mark
3296000	3298000	Of course the Kinect hardware
3298000	3300000	Has sold 8 million units
3300000	3302000	Worldwide
3302000	3304000	And also
3304000	3306000	It's kind of neat to mention
3306000	3308000	And I don't think a lot of people know this yet
3308000	3310000	But in case you haven't picked up Dance Central
3310000	3312000	Or you're thinking of picking it up
3312000	3314000	You may want to wait a little bit
3314000	3316000	Because they're actually going to be doing a new
3316000	3318000	Skew that's going to be coming out to the market soon
3318000	3320000	That will give you, I guess, your first piece of
3320000	3322000	Download content for free
3322000	3324000	It's going to include a code for
3324000	3326000	240 Microsoft points bundled into the box
3326000	3328000	Ooh!
3328000	3330000	Like $3 for free
3330000	3332000	That's nice, one free song or whatever
3332000	3334000	Yeah, so
3334000	3336000	But yeah, the game is pretty awesome
3336000	3338000	I have to actually go back and play it
3338000	3340000	Now that I've got the living room
3340000	3342000	I need to play more of this but my apartment
3342000	3344000	Is too fucking small
3344000	3346000	It's kind of sad
3346000	3348000	But yeah, Dance Central is a fun time
3348000	3350000	And it's so funny because
3350000	3352000	Last night I was out at the club
3352000	3354000	And they were playing actually
3354000	3356000	A couple songs that I recognized from Dance Central
3356000	3358000	Like Evacuate the Dance Floor
3358000	3360000	So when Evacuate the Dance Floor started playing
3360000	3362000	I actually kind of started doing this in my seat
3362000	3364000	Evacuate the Dance
3364000	3366000	I was doing the whole little dance from
3366000	3368000	The game
3368000	3370000	That's what that was, I just thought you were drunk
3370000	3372000	I didn't know, I had no idea
3372000	3374000	No, that was the dance from Dance Central
3374000	3376000	And like you and Rice Princess and Xtaphir
3376000	3378000	I went out and got drunk with Xtaphir and Rice Princess
3378000	3380000	And Salacious Pop last night
3380000	3382000	And so you know
3382000	3384000	And Grandpa Warcraft for those who listen to Hoard House
3384000	3386000	That went out last night
3386000	3388000	We all went out and you know good times are had
3388000	3390000	And when that song came
3390000	3392000	And then what's the other song
3392000	3394000	Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
3394000	3396000	I hate that song so much
3396000	3398000	I was doing the whole fist bumping thing
3398000	3400000	I know you want me
3400000	3402000	I know I want you
3402000	3404000	If that song was released by
3404000	3406000	Triumph the insult comic dog
3406000	3408000	Then it would be amazing, but it's not
3410000	3412000	The routine is pretty fun though
3412000	3414000	The thing about Dance Central
3414000	3416000	Is that as stinking cheesy as those dances are
3416000	3418000	You kind of start to remember them
3418000	3420000	After you play the game enough times
3420000	3422000	And I'm tempted to do it on the dance floor
3422000	3424000	That one's really weird
3424000	3426000	It's like a lot of jumping around
3428000	3430000	Good times
3430000	3432000	Something that won't be as easy to dance to
3432000	3434000	And you really really should not reenact
3434000	3436000	In real life at all
3436000	3438000	The kind of
3438000	3440000	I guess you could say
3440000	3442000	Very hard R rated
3442000	3444000	Mortal Kombat
3444000	3446000	Episodes that are going to be coming out soon
3446000	3448000	Okay you might remember there was this little
3448000	3450000	YouTube clip some time ago
3450000	3452000	That was like a concept video
3452000	3454000	For a Mortal Kombat movie reboot
3454000	3456000	And it was like imagine if Mortal Kombat
3456000	3458000	When all saw Anya
3458000	3460000	And it was really violent
3460000	3462000	And some big names were in this
3462000	3464000	Michael Jai White
3464000	3466000	Michael Jai White was Jax and TitsOf9
3466000	3468000	What's her name?
3468000	3470000	She was Sonya
3470000	3472000	Jerry Ryan was Sonya in this
3472000	3474000	And yeah
3474000	3476000	Sadly they're not going to make it a movie
3476000	3478000	That's not happening but what is going to happen
3478000	3480000	There's going to be some webisodes
3480000	3482000	A 10 part Mortal Kombat webisode series
3482000	3484000	I guess this is somewhat to promote
3484000	3486000	The new games that are coming out
3486000	3488000	So I wonder if that will somehow work together
3488000	3490000	Michael Jai White is going to come back
3490000	3492000	As Jax
3492000	3494000	However the website Bloody Disgusting
3494000	3496000	That reported on this because that's a website all about
3496000	3498000	The gore movies basically
3498000	3500000	They didn't say a whole lot about the storyline
3500000	3502000	So I imagine this is all just a part to kind of like
3502000	3504000	Pump up the release of the game
3504000	3506000	But we don't know a whole lot outside of that
3506000	3508000	So I guess it's neat
3508000	3510000	I'm not into the uber violence
3510000	3512000	You see like I like Mortal Kombat
3512000	3514000	Because it's cartoony violence
3514000	3516000	Like cartoony violence is funny to me
3516000	3518000	But I don't like the Saw movies
3518000	3520000	Like that just crosses the line
3520000	3522000	To me
3522000	3524000	So I don't know how I feel about this whole thing
3524000	3526000	Am I a hypocrite?
3526000	3528000	So let's just pop
3528000	3530000	Am I a hypocrite because I like Mortal Kombat
3530000	3532000	But I don't like Saw
3532000	3534000	A little
3534000	3536000	A little bit I don't know
3536000	3538000	I haven't really thought about it too much
3538000	3540000	One of them is cartoony though
3540000	3542000	I don't know it's different to me
3542000	3544000	We'll see
3544000	3546000	Weiland in our chatroom says that Michael Jai White
3546000	3548000	Has said those webisodes would lead into a movie
3548000	3550000	Well I'm sure it would be better than the movie
3550000	3552000	That had come out before it
3552000	3554000	Spazinator says anyone remember the short lived
3554000	3556000	Mortal Kombat TV show back in the 90's
3556000	3558000	Yeah
3558000	3560000	That was an intru- I remember that show
3560000	3562000	It was on the network here
3562000	3564000	That is now the CW
3564000	3566000	That used to just show all the
3566000	3568000	You know before there was a CW
3568000	3570000	Network they would show all the shows
3570000	3572000	Yeah no even before that
3572000	3574000	Because this show was on I want to say in the early
3574000	3576000	No I guess it was UPN
3576000	3578000	It was UPN at the time that's right
3578000	3580000	So it's just funny
3580000	3582000	Anyhow
3582000	3584000	We'll see what becomes of this Mortal Kombat
3584000	3586000	As we get closer to the game coming out
3586000	3588000	But for now we move on with more news
3588000	3590000	Slice pop
3590000	3592000	Okay so
3592000	3594000	Capcom is coming out with a system
3594000	3596000	For Marvel vs. Capcom 3
3596000	3600000	Where if you do the versus online mode
3600000	3602000	And you're playing some stranger
3602000	3604000	And he dunks on you really bad
3604000	3606000	And the only reason why he didn't get a perfect
3606000	3608000	On your ass is because you got in some block damage
3608000	3610000	And you say screw this
3610000	3612000	And quit
3612000	3614000	Well you're going to eventually rally up enough
3614000	3616000	Rage quit points or whatever
3616000	3618000	That you're going to be thrown into
3618000	3620000	Other random battles with other
3620000	3622000	Rage quitters
3622000	3624000	To discourage that type of behavior
3624000	3626000	So yeah
3626000	3628000	That is
3628000	3630000	Interesting I believe in
3630000	3632000	Tatsunoko vs. Capcom for the Wii
3632000	3634000	They have a similar system
3634000	3636000	You enter a random battle
3636000	3638000	In the middle of it because you're losing
3638000	3640000	Then once you finally get someone
3640000	3642000	That you can win a round on
3642000	3644000	Rage quit on you
3644000	3646000	And you guys can just all rage quit on each other
3646000	3648000	While the more serious competitors will
3648000	3650000	Take their random battles more seriously I guess
3650000	3652000	So yeah
3652000	3654000	That story
3654000	3656000	Came out last week
3656000	3658000	Sounds interesting
3658000	3660000	I wish they'd do this in WoW
3660000	3662000	I wish they'd do this in Grand Theft Auto
3662000	3664000	Does everyone seem to like this idea?
3664000	3666000	What if the rage quitting is beyond your control though?
3666000	3668000	What if it's like a legit connection failure?
3668000	3670000	If you're out in the boonies
3670000	3672000	And you only have like maybe satellite
3672000	3674000	As your only broadband option
3674000	3676000	Then yeah that might suck for you
3676000	3678000	But then again
3678000	3680000	You're still a problem for the people you're trying
3680000	3682000	To play against
3682000	3684000	You're still dropping out all the time
3684000	3686000	So maybe you do need to be paired with the rage quitters
3686000	3688000	They don't know that you dropped out
3688000	3690000	They just think you're a rage quitter anyway
3690000	3692000	So it's still your problem
3692000	3694000	With auto matches and stuff
3694000	3696000	But I would think that they would know
3696000	3698000	That I'm not rage quitting because I'm kicking the fucking
3698000	3700000	Ass out of them
3700000	3702000	And I'm in first place and then I drop
3702000	3704000	It's not like, oh dammit I'm doing too good
3704000	3706000	I'm leaving
3706000	3708000	Okay well we both see myself
3708000	3710000	Maybe a little bit
3710000	3712000	Just a tad
3712000	3714000	Let's travel around the world and look at release dates
3714000	3716000	For games that are coming out soon
3716000	3718000	More games that you can rage quit in
3718000	3720000	Yes this week is not too busy
3720000	3722000	But it doesn't fucking matter
3722000	3724000	Because there's only really one game you should pick up
3724000	3726000	And that would be LittleBigPlanet 2
3726000	3728000	Very excited that this game is coming out
3728000	3730000	And I can dust off my PS3 finally
3730000	3732000	And play this game
3732000	3734000	So it's pretty awesome
3734000	3736000	If you haven't played this game yet too
3736000	3738000	On Playstation 3 as well
3738000	3740000	Mass Effect 2 will be making its way out
3740000	3742000	And it's slightly
3742000	3744000	Polished
3744000	3746000	Mass Effect 3 engine
3746000	3748000	Along with all the download content
3748000	3750000	So that's kind of cool
3750000	3752000	That'll be out this week as well
3752000	3754000	Some other fun stuff coming out this week
3754000	3756000	Plants vs. Zombies on Nintendo DS
3756000	3758000	Which is a pretty awesome game
3758000	3760000	Mindjack is actually
3760000	3762000	Kind of a neat looking game
3762000	3764000	This is on Playstation 3 and 360 from Square Enix
3764000	3766000	Getting some comparisons
3766000	3768000	To Demon's Souls actually
3768000	3770000	Except for the, I don't think it's supposed to be
3770000	3772000	To the point where you want to
3772000	3774000	Blow your brains out hard
3774000	3776000	But
3776000	3778000	Apparently it's one of those games that
3778000	3780000	Has a persistent online
3780000	3782000	Portion of it where you can jump into other
3782000	3784000	People's games and play as the villains
3784000	3786000	Nice, I love that idea
3786000	3788000	So yeah
3788000	3790000	That's something that's coming out this week which is pretty cool
3790000	3792000	And then
3792000	3794000	What else
3794000	3796000	Oh Spellforce 2
3796000	3798000	Faith and Destiny I guess is a PC title that's coming out
3798000	3800000	This week as well as Fanatica on PC
3800000	3802000	That was a little bit of a holdover
3802000	3804000	But that's it, really a small week
3804000	3806000	I bet you anything there's going to be a Demon's Souls 2
3806000	3808000	Announced at E3 this year
3808000	3810000	Oh there will be a Demon's Souls 2
3810000	3812000	That game sold incredibly well for them
3812000	3814000	I remember though, I actually played that at E3
3814000	3816000	Before it came out and there wasn't a whole lot of buzz around it
3816000	3818000	But I remember playing that demo early on
3818000	3820000	Thinking it was a pretty neat little game
3820000	3822000	But I didn't know about all these other features
3822000	3824000	Until after the game had come out
3824000	3826000	It was hard to get that from a demo
3826000	3828000	Playing it on the show floor
3828000	3830000	I bet you there's another one coming out this year
3830000	3832000	It's going to be interesting
3832000	3834000	I'd say I'd check it out
3834000	3836000	But unfortunately games cost $60
3836000	3838000	So if I'm not able to rent it first or try it
3838000	3840000	I don't know
3840000	3842000	Give it some time
3842000	3844000	Especially since it's packed in between
3844000	3846000	LittleBigPlanet 2 and
3846000	3848000	Dead Space 2
3848000	3850000	A lot of people aren't going to realize that this game is out
3850000	3852000	And they'll probably drop the price rather quick
3852000	3854000	We'll see
3854000	3856000	Let's move to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates
3856000	3858000	We have Kinect Joyride coming out on the 360
3858000	3860000	As well as Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom
3860000	3862000	Both come out on the 20th of this month
3862000	3864000	On 360
3864000	3866000	So they're getting some of their Kinect localized titles
3866000	3868000	A little later than we had them here
3868000	3870000	That also comes out by the way on the Playstation 3
3870000	3872000	Not Kinect of course, but Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom
3872000	3874000	Comes out from Namco Bandai
3874000	3876000	This game
3876000	3878000	I'm trying to think if I've heard of this here in the US
3878000	3880000	And I know I've seen a trailer for this
3880000	3882000	And it actually looks pretty awesome
3882000	3884000	Loki, what is this game called here?
3884000	3886000	It's from Namco
3886000	3888000	And it's like Overworld
3888000	3890000	There's a giant following you
3890000	3892000	It's called Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom
3892000	3894000	Is this called the same game here?
3894000	3896000	It came out over the end of November
3896000	3898000	What? I missed this game?
3898000	3900000	Yes you did
3900000	3902000	This looks kind of neat
3902000	3904000	How well received was it?
3904000	3906000	I don't know
3906000	3908000	It dropped in price a bunch of times
3908000	3910000	Right before it came out
3910000	3912000	I think it was only a $40 game
3912000	3914000	I might have to check that out
3914000	3916000	So many games came out at the end of last year
3916000	3918000	I forgot about it because
3918000	3920000	Was it
3920000	3922000	Operation Black
3922000	3924000	Black Ops
3924000	3926000	Something like that
3926000	3928000	Assassin something or other
3928000	3930000	Creed, Brotherhood
3930000	3932000	Alright also coming out on Playstation 3
3932000	3934000	This is a price reduction of a game that's already been out
3934000	3936000	It comes in the best series now
3936000	3938000	Ryugago Toku
3938000	3940000	4 Densetsu
3940000	3942000	Sugimono
3942000	3944000	You might know this game as Yakuza 4
3944000	3946000	Same game there and that's getting a big price reduction
3946000	3948000	On the Playstation 3 this week
3948000	3950000	Going to some other systems like the
3950000	3952000	Nintendo Wii
3952000	3954000	Sengoku Mosuo 3
3954000	3956000	Gets a price reduction this week
3956000	3958000	Momotaro Densetsu
3958000	3960000	2010 Sengoku Ishin no Hiro
3960000	3962000	Das Yugo
3962000	3964000	Gets a price
3964000	3966000	I think that's a price reduction as well this week
3966000	3968000	So lots and lots of things getting cheaper
3968000	3970000	I'm trying to see what this game is
3970000	3972000	This looks kind of like a train station
3972000	3974000	These train games are very popular
3974000	3976000	Over there in Japan so it's another train simulator
3976000	3978000	Game that is
3978000	3980000	Getting a price reduction there
3980000	3982000	Starting to see some stuff for the
3982000	3984000	3DS forming in Japan
3984000	3986000	Can't talk about it until February 26
3986000	3988000	But that's starting to show up on my list so that's kind of exciting
3988000	3990000	But if you want to go back to the regular DS
3990000	3992000	Zombie Daisuke comes out this week
3992000	3994000	As well as yet another price
3994000	3996000	Reduction for Gaikuten
3996000	3998000	Kenji comes out
3998000	4000000	Also Plants vs. Zombies
4000000	4002000	I guess comes out in the US this week
4002000	4004000	And that is actually getting some
4004000	4006000	Import over in Japan believe it or not
4006000	4008000	Also a huge huge release
4008000	4010000	On the PSP this week
4010000	4012000	Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep
4012000	4014000	Final Mix
4014000	4016000	So it's kind of like the game redone with the extra stuff
4016000	4018000	Including anything we got here
4018000	4020000	In the US that they didn't get over there
4020000	4022000	One other game on the PSP dimension
4022000	4024000	Venus and Braves
4024000	4026000	Majo to Megami to Horiobi
4026000	4028000	no Yugen comes out from Bandai Namco
4028000	4030000	This week as well
4030000	4032000	So there you go
4032000	4034000	Venus Braves by the way is
4034000	4036000	What that series is known as
4036000	4038000	That's it for Japanese releases
4038000	4040000	How about the UK?
4040000	4042000	Alright for UK releases I'm going to take it back
4042000	4044000	A couple days just to remind everybody
4044000	4046000	In the great old Britain
4046000	4048000	That DC Universe Online
4048000	4050000	Came out on the 14th
4050000	4052000	On both PC and
4052000	4054000	Playstation 3
4054000	4056000	And also a game called Ghost Trick
4056000	4058000	For the DS that was January 14th
4058000	4060000	And Kingdom Hearts
4060000	4062000	Recoded as well on the DS on the
4062000	4064000	January 14th
4064000	4066000	For this upcoming week we have on the
4066000	4068000	January 17th
4068000	4070000	Monday Night Combat for the PC
4070000	4072000	On the 21st
4072000	4074000	We have LittleBigPlanet 2
4074000	4076000	For the PS3
4076000	4078000	Mass Effect 2 for the PS3
4078000	4080000	And Mind Jack for the
4080000	4082000	Xbox 360 and
4082000	4084000	Playstation 3
4084000	4086000	All of next week
4086000	4088000	On the 21st
4088000	4090000	You know what's funny about those releases
4090000	4092000	Is that I almost pretty much heard the same stuff
4092000	4094000	When Loki was talking
4094000	4096000	And you don't see that a lot
4096000	4098000	Usually the UK will get their stuff late
4098000	4100000	Yeah so that's pretty cool
4100000	4102000	That a lot of this stuff is coming out in tandem
4102000	4104000	So if I were living overseas I'd be pretty happy
4104000	4106000	Right now to hear that
4106000	4108000	Alright well let's move on with a couple more stories
4108000	4110000	And then the classic game of the week
4110000	4112000	I know Dark Soccer is not here tonight
4112000	4114000	We're gonna get to the classic game of the week in just a little bit
4114000	4116000	But first two more news stories for you guys
4116000	4118000	Yes unfortunately the Wii
4118000	4120000	Always gets shit on when it comes
4120000	4122000	To download content
4122000	4124000	And that seems to be what's going on this time
4124000	4126000	The Rock Band Network
4126000	4128000	Which is releasing a bunch of indie tracks
4128000	4130000	On the Xbox 360
4130000	4132000	And I believe they were getting a few
4132000	4134000	You know ported over to
4134000	4136000	The PS3 and Wii well that's gonna
4136000	4138000	Stop at least on the Wii
4138000	4140000	It says with a smaller install
4140000	4142000	Base, limited demand for releases
4142000	4144000	So far and the significant amount of work
4144000	4146000	It takes for our producers and audio team
4146000	4148000	To convert and process
4148000	4150000	These additional tracks
4150000	4152000	We are no longer able to
4152000	4154000	Continue submitting Rock Band Network content
4154000	4156000	To the Wii
4156000	4158000	So to summarize
4158000	4160000	Or in other words no one's fucking buying
4160000	4162000	It so we're gonna stop making it
4162000	4164000	It says regular Wii DLC
4164000	4166000	And Rock Band Network releases for the 360
4166000	4168000	And PS3 will continue uninterrupted
4168000	4170000	Honestly
4170000	4172000	Truthfully I think the Wii owners are lucky
4172000	4174000	To be getting any DLC at all
4174000	4176000	Like with how crappy Nintendo's
4176000	4178000	Online front end is compared to their competitors
4178000	4180000	I am I honestly think
4180000	4182000	Harmonix is graceful
4182000	4184000	And generous in the amount of content
4184000	4186000	That they do put out on the Wii
4186000	4188000	And like I realize that a lot of people own a Wii
4188000	4190000	And a lot of people have this game on the Wii
4190000	4192000	But I think they more than support
4192000	4194000	Their game like better than
4194000	4196000	Probably any other fucking company
4196000	4198000	Does on the Wii
4198000	4200000	Well at least on the Wii though you get some Rock Band stuff
4200000	4202000	This week on the 18th
4202000	4204000	You get the main drag
4204000	4206000	How we look on paper
4206000	4208000	Wounded Soul RX
4208000	4210000	Band of Horses
4210000	4212000	The Great Soul Lake
4212000	4214000	Firewind Head of High
4214000	4216000	Seton Clausen
4216000	4218000	The Soul Side
4218000	4220000	White Heat
4220000	4222000	OK Go with White Knuckles
4222000	4224000	Alright
4224000	4226000	Moving on
4226000	4228000	This makes me very happy because I
4228000	4230000	Loved all these old school PC
4230000	4232000	Games back in the day
4232000	4234000	Apparently there's a new web app
4234000	4236000	That allows you to play Sierra
4236000	4238000	Online games on your iPad
4238000	4240000	In related news
4240000	4242000	I'm gonna go buy an iPad
4242000	4244000	Like ASAP
4244000	4246000	I wonder if it will work on the iPhone
4246000	4248000	But I don't know it might be a little hard to play on the iPhone
4248000	4250000	Alright here's the deal
4250000	4252000	The website
4252000	4254000	Is called Sarian.net
4254000	4256000	It's made
4256000	4258000	The Sierra Online adventure games
4258000	4260000	That they have like Space Quest, Kings Quest
4260000	4262000	And Leisure Suit Larry
4262000	4264000	You can play them on the iPad
4264000	4266000	All you have to do is go to the website
4266000	4268000	S-A-R-I-E-N.net
4268000	4270000	And do this before they get that season desist letter loaded on them
4270000	4272000	You can go on there and you can play
4272000	4274000	These games on the iPad
4274000	4276000	And it looks like the way this works
4276000	4278000	Is a lot of the words kind of show up
4278000	4280000	On the bottom of the screen so you can kind of touch them
4280000	4282000	To put the words in and what have you
4282000	4284000	Uh yeah
4284000	4286000	That's basically the deal
4286000	4288000	Man that's great if I had an iPad
4288000	4290000	I'd be checking that out right now
4290000	4292000	In fact I might try it on my iPhone
4292000	4294000	But I'm guessing it doesn't work nearly as well
4294000	4296000	Because you don't have quite the same real estate
4296000	4298000	So there you go
4300000	4302000	I wonder how they're getting away with this
4302000	4304000	I guess it's just kind of one of those
4304000	4306000	Intel they get the season desist letter
4306000	4308000	They're just gonna do it
4308000	4310000	On the internet everybody has it
4310000	4312000	I don't know
4312000	4314000	S-S-A-R-I-E-N.net.net says wait for iPad 2
4314000	4316000	It comes with electric boogaloo
4316000	4318000	That's from our chatroom chat.orangelsageradio.com
4318000	4320000	I am gonna actually wait for uh
4320000	4322000	iPad 2
4322000	4324000	I do want to wait for that
4324000	4326000	Because it'll have the front facing cam
4326000	4328000	And all the other frills and stuff
4328000	4330000	Yeah I enjoy whenever we go to the mall
4330000	4332000	And we pass the Apple store
4332000	4334000	I was like hey Rob go get your iPad
4334000	4336000	Just impulse buy it right now
4336000	4338000	These days I'm gonna do it
4338000	4340000	And then you're gonna be like I was kidding
4340000	4342000	I ain't really mean for that to happen
4342000	4344000	Well you know when the iPad 2 is announced
4344000	4346000	The prices of those iPad 1's are gonna
4346000	4348000	Plummet. Like they're gonna go down to
4348000	4350000	Two, three hundred dollars
4350000	4352000	I have so many friends that work at the Apple
4352000	4354000	Mothership down in
4354000	4356000	Where is that?
4356000	4358000	I don't even know
4358000	4360000	Well all your friends work there shouldn't you know?
4360000	4362000	Cupertino here
4362000	4364000	And whenever the new generation of
4364000	4366000	iPods come out
4366000	4368000	Within their internal employee store
4368000	4370000	Cause they get mark downs on that
4370000	4372000	Dirt cheap I've gotten two iPods that way
4372000	4374000	Nice
4374000	4376000	Well except you'll want a new one
4376000	4378000	No I want one of the new fancy pants ones
4378000	4380000	I don't want that old shit I want the new one
4380000	4382000	So I can do drunken FaceTime cause that's the only reason you use FaceTime
4382000	4384000	Is when you're rip-roaring drunk which I didn't do last night
4384000	4386000	Oddly enough but anyway
4386000	4388000	FaceTime is best for like drunk
4388000	4390000	Dialing it's drunk dialing for a new century
4390000	4392000	Is what it is
4392000	4394000	There you go
4394000	4396000	And to answer your question
4396000	4398000	Yes you can play it on an
4398000	4400000	iPod but
4400000	4402000	It's hard
4402000	4404000	Why is it hard?
4404000	4406000	It's small because you have to type in text on the bottom here
4406000	4408000	Oh yuck
4408000	4410000	But you can do it you can click around
4410000	4412000	Cause it supports the
4412000	4414000	Safari
4414000	4416000	Wow that's kinda cool
4416000	4418000	Alright question from our chat
4418000	4420000	Room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com
4420000	4422000	Live here on this Sunday evening
4422000	4424000	Dark Tetsuya says Rob you gonna wait for the 3DSI?
4424000	4426000	No I'm getting the 3DS right
4426000	4428000	When it comes out and I bet a lot of you
4428000	4430000	Skeptic folks the first time you see the 3DS
4430000	4432000	You're gonna be like holy shit it really is 3D
4432000	4434000	Without glasses and you'll probably buy it too
4434000	4436000	I'm really not trying to sound
4436000	4438000	Like a fanboy like don't get me wrong
4438000	4440000	Nintendo pisses me off more than they usually make me happy
4440000	4442000	But the 3DS
4442000	4444000	It's a pretty fantastic piece of technology
4444000	4446000	Like I'm almost excited to get it for
4446000	4448000	And I know this is gonna sound weird cause I'm
4448000	4450000	Not a fan of 3D movies but like
4450000	4452000	The 3D on the DS doesn't really bother me
4452000	4454000	I'm excited to see what kind of 3D movies
4454000	4456000	Come out on the DS
4456000	4458000	If Tron Legacy comes out in 3D
4458000	4460000	On the DS on the 3DS
4460000	4462000	Like I'm there
4462000	4464000	Hello
4464000	4466000	Seriously don't you want that?
4466000	4468000	So
4468000	4470000	Hell yes I want that
4470000	4472000	Alright let's get to the classic
4472000	4474000	Game of the week here at Orange Lounge Radio
4474000	4476000	We do a segment every week called the classic
4476000	4478000	Game of the week and it has a little theme
4478000	4480000	Song
4480000	4482000	And this is the part of the week where DarkSakura
4482000	4484000	Dives into her vault and she drags out
4484000	4486000	A classic video game and she says hey
4486000	4488000	You ungrateful brats this is a game
4488000	4490000	That you should be playing this week but guess what?
4490000	4492000	She ain't here so we've hijacked
4492000	4494000	The classic game of the week segment this week
4494000	4496000	And we're allowing her fill in tonight
4496000	4498000	SalaciousPop to choose a
4498000	4500000	Classic game of the week that he thinks
4500000	4502000	You guys should be playing because you know
4502000	4504000	DarkSakura love her to bits
4504000	4506000	And she does pick a lot of Sega stuff
4506000	4508000	So we thought maybe SalaciousPop could pick something
4508000	4510000	That DarkSakura maybe would not pick
4510000	4512000	I made sure that I'm not
4512000	4514000	Stepping on DarkSakura's toes on the whole
4514000	4516000	Console classic
4516000	4518000	So I picked a PC classic
4518000	4520000	Namely King's Quest 4
4520000	4522000	The Perils of Rosella
4522000	4524000	How appropriate considering the last story
4524000	4526000	Off of the Sierra Online story we just finished up
4526000	4528000	Wonderful choice
4528000	4530000	Let's see if we can get some music here
4530000	4532000	A single tear rolling down my face right now
4532000	4534000	At the title screen music
4534000	4536000	This is the fourth
4536000	4538000	In the series obviously
4538000	4540000	Came out August 16th
4540000	4542000	1988 for MS-DOS
4542000	4544000	Amiga
4544000	4546000	Apple 2GS
4546000	4548000	And Atari ST
4548000	4550000	PC platforms
4550000	4552000	I remember playing this game
4552000	4554000	With my friend in junior high
4554000	4556000	Across I think 9
4556000	4558000	5 and a quarter inch floppies
4558000	4560000	And you could install it to your hard drive
4560000	4562000	And hard drives back then were like 40 megabytes
4562000	4564000	If you were lucky
4564000	4566000	Or you could move
4566000	4568000	To the next screen and it'll say
4568000	4570000	Insert disk 6
4570000	4572000	Insert disk 7
4572000	4574000	So it was a game like that
4574000	4576000	I loved this game
4576000	4578000	Because it was the last
4578000	4580000	In the King's Quest series
4580000	4582000	That used the traditional text based
4582000	4584000	Input system
4584000	4586000	Like look under bridge
4586000	4588000	Search room all that stuff
4588000	4590000	King's Quest 5
4590000	4592000	Adopted the new mouse cursor
4592000	4594000	Engine
4594000	4596000	So King's Quest 4 the last
4596000	4598000	Traditional text based King's Quest game
4598000	4600000	Takes place immediately
4600000	4602000	After the events of
4602000	4604000	King's Quest 3
4604000	4606000	You play Rosella
4606000	4608000	The daughter of King Graham
4608000	4610000	Of Daventry
4610000	4612000	King Graham in the opening sequence has a heart attack
4612000	4614000	The magic mirror tells you
4614000	4616000	You need to be ported away to
4616000	4618000	A magical world
4618000	4620000	To Tamir
4620000	4622000	To find this fruit
4622000	4624000	And if King Graham can eat the fruit he will not die
4624000	4626000	And this game had an internal timer
4626000	4628000	You had to get the fruit and make it back
4628000	4630000	To King Graham within a certain amount of game time
4630000	4632000	Or else he would die and it would be game over
4632000	4634000	So you had to figure out the puzzles relatively quickly
4634000	4636000	At some point
4636000	4638000	It turned to night
4638000	4640000	And everything got dark
4640000	4642000	There were certain puzzles that you could only
4642000	4644000	Like there was an abandoned mansion
4644000	4646000	There was nothing to do there
4646000	4648000	Unless you went there at night when it was haunted
4648000	4650000	Because the puzzles didn't light up
4650000	4652000	Until it was dark
4652000	4654000	So you had to
4654000	4656000	Do everything else and then
4656000	4658000	That was the last place you went to
4658000	4660000	While it was still nightfall
4660000	4662000	It had multiple endings
4662000	4664000	It was possible to
4664000	4666000	Survive the
4666000	4668000	Dangers of Tamir and escape the
4668000	4670000	Evil witch Lalote
4670000	4672000	And make it back
4672000	4674000	To King Graham without actually getting
4674000	4676000	The fruit
4676000	4678000	So you had to be
4678000	4680000	Able to figure out where it was
4680000	4682000	What items you needed to
4682000	4684000	Get the item and then
4684000	4686000	You know, survive the evil
4686000	4688000	The antagonist, the evil witch
4688000	4690000	And then give him the food in the end
4690000	4692000	So it had multiple endings which was pretty
4692000	4694000	Innovative at the time
4694000	4696000	I think EGA graphics
4696000	4698000	But the pixels were a lot smaller
4698000	4700000	Than the traditional King's Quest games
4700000	4702000	So visually even for EGA graphics
4702000	4704000	16 color
4704000	4706000	Stunning, and the music of course
4706000	4708000	With the King's Quest 4 I believe
4708000	4710000	Was one of the first Sierra games that actually
4710000	4712000	Used sound cards
4712000	4714000	Instead of just the beep beep beep beep
4714000	4716000	Good old ad lib
4716000	4718000	I had an ad lib back in the day
4718000	4720000	King's Quests, I want to say 1 through 3
4720000	4722000	Or maybe 1 and 2
4722000	4724000	Just use your internal speaker
4724000	4726000	The loud harsh beeps
4726000	4728000	Sound card support
4728000	4730000	So amazing game
4730000	4732000	Also like most
4732000	4734000	Of the King's Quest games it was possible
4734000	4736000	To miss an item that you needed
4736000	4738000	To not die or to
4738000	4740000	Kill the big bad at the end
4740000	4742000	If you missed that puzzle
4742000	4744000	If you let Cupid fly away from the little pool
4744000	4746000	Without getting his cupid's bow and arrow
4746000	4748000	And you saved your game, you were screwed
4748000	4750000	Couldn't beat it, sorry try again
4750000	4752000	So yeah
4752000	4754000	Great game
4754000	4756000	So many people think so fondly
4756000	4758000	Of 4 specifically, like you asked
4758000	4760000	Most people what's your favorite King's Quest game
4760000	4762000	And most people, including myself, would say
4762000	4764000	4 was the best, period
4764000	4766000	Out of a what, 8 game series
4766000	4768000	Most people would say 4 is the best
4768000	4770000	I rejected the reality
4770000	4772000	And where it ate is real
4772000	4774000	7
4774000	4776000	Fine, some might argue 9
4776000	4778000	If you count this fan silver lining at this point
4778000	4780000	But why is it, regardless of how many
4780000	4782000	You think there are
4782000	4784000	Why is it that 4 is the one that's so fond
4784000	4786000	And meet people's hearts
4786000	4788000	I mean, again, I'm sure there's people listening to this show going
4788000	4790000	No, 5 was my favorite, or you know, 1 was the best
4790000	4792000	Why 4? So many people that I know at least
4792000	4794000	Um
4794000	4796000	Visually, at the time, people just
4796000	4798000	Never saw a game that was that beautiful
4798000	4800000	On PC gaming
4800000	4802000	It really took EGA graphics
4802000	4804000	As far as they literally could go
4804000	4806000	Without stepping up to VGA 256 colors
4806000	4808000	Um, so just visually
4808000	4810000	People just remember how awestruck they were
4810000	4812000	When they saw it
4812000	4814000	And they loaded up the game
4814000	4816000	When you first arrive on that beach
4816000	4818000	And you can see the wave of the ocean
4818000	4820000	Up against, you know, the yellow sand
4820000	4822000	The sound card support
4822000	4824000	To actually have ad-lib music coming at you through your speakers
4824000	4826000	Um
4826000	4828000	And I think the nostalgia of
4828000	4830000	Text-based RPGs
4830000	4832000	Cause it was the last one in that series
4832000	4834000	King's Quest V and VI were all mouse-based
4834000	4836000	I think for me, a big part of it too was in the story
4836000	4838000	It seemed like a lot of it was inspired by
4838000	4840000	Fables, Aesop's Fables, like Hansel's and Gretel's
4840000	4842000	Type of thing, I think that is very
4842000	4844000	Fond as well for me, I think that's why
4844000	4846000	I grabbed it for IV
4846000	4848000	King's Quest has always had that a little bit, but yes
4848000	4850000	There were a lot of great
4850000	4852000	Meta genre references
4852000	4854000	Particularly in IV
4854000	4856000	Um, the three hags that represent
4856000	4858000	The three fates that all share one eye
4858000	4860000	And you had to catch their eyes
4860000	4862000	So they were blind, otherwise they were gonna eat you
4862000	4864000	That was in King's Quest IV
4864000	4866000	Um, you find a
4866000	4868000	Gold ball and you throw it into a pond
4868000	4870000	And you have to kiss the frog, like the
4870000	4872000	Princess and the frog, that's in King's Quest IV
4872000	4874000	So a lot of, yeah, classic fairy tale
4874000	4876000	Um, homages are in
4876000	4878000	In this particular title
4878000	4880000	Man, I really wish this series would come back
4880000	4882000	And yes, I understand there's the fan project
4882000	4884000	And I mean no disrespect, they're doing a
4884000	4886000	Wonderful, wonderful thing, and they've
4886000	4888000	Taken so much shit for what is really
4888000	4890000	Like, a thing that they love, and you know
4890000	4892000	So I'm definitely not slamming that at all
4892000	4894000	But I really wish somebody would just
4894000	4896000	Give people lots of money
4896000	4898000	To make a big budget return
4898000	4900000	Of King's Quest, you know what I mean?
4900000	4902000	How awesome would that be?
4902000	4904000	Well, there have been fan service, um
4904000	4906000	VGA or SVGA remakes of the first three
4906000	4908000	Sure, sure
4908000	4910000	That are completely independent and they run great
4910000	4912000	But I mean, just like now with today's technology
4912000	4914000	And games and so forth with, you know, like
4914000	4916000	The DVD and Blu-ray technology and stuff
4916000	4918000	Like, I would just love to see, like, a really
4918000	4920000	Well done new King's Quest game
4920000	4922000	That's just, you know, like
4922000	4924000	I don't know, I don't even know how to explain it
4924000	4926000	Like, just that whole kind of world
4926000	4928000	I want to go back to that, you know
4928000	4929000	Yeah, yeah
4929000	4931000	I don't know, and again, I realize Silver Lining
4931000	4933000	Can kind of take me there, but Silver Lining
4933000	4935000	Is also very much in that same vein
4935000	4937000	Of what we remember, but I'd like to see
4937000	4939000	Someone kind of like take King's Quest, that series
4939000	4941000	And bring it to today's technology
4941000	4943000	Big budget type of game
4943000	4945000	The closest thing I think we got was the longest
4945000	4947000	Journey and the longest journey 2
4947000	4949000	Completely different franchise and story
4949000	4951000	And company, but when that game, cause
4951000	4953000	There was a point in the
4953000	4955000	There was, I think, a sort of a
4955000	4957000	A shift in what people wanted
4957000	4959000	On PC gaming, I think around
4959000	4961000	Maybe the early, mid 90's
4961000	4963000	Where adventure games were boring
4963000	4965000	People didn't like them anymore
4965000	4967000	Cause Doom came in
4967000	4969000	And PC became about first person shooters
4969000	4971000	And then Half-Life and all that
4971000	4973000	And the Sierra style of games, Space Quest
4973000	4975000	King's Quest, were sort of left in the wake
4975000	4977000	You would think though, with all the nostalgia
4977000	4979000	Wank that happens out there in the world
4979000	4981000	Though that there would be room for this
4981000	4983000	And I realize that's kind of where Telltale
4983000	4985000	Kind of has their market right now
4985000	4987000	And they do a very good job at what they do
4987000	4989000	But I'm just surprised
4989000	4991000	Especially when that whole silver lining stuff
4991000	4993000	Was going on, that uh, who owns a license now?
4993000	4995000	Activision I guess, who got it from Vivendi
4995000	4997000	Has basically said, you know what
4997000	4999000	We don't want to revisit that world
4999000	5001000	And that's not just King's Quest
5001000	5003000	That's Space Quest, that's uh
5003000	5005000	Police Quest, Quest for Glory
5005000	5007000	Quest for Glory, all that stuff
5007000	5009000	And it's just, I don't know, it's just kind of annoying
5009000	5011000	Cause I would really like to see some of that come back
5011000	5013000	This is gonna sound a little elitist
5013000	5015000	And maybe I'm a bit proud
5015000	5017000	That this is elitist
5017000	5019000	These games, probably too hard
5019000	5021000	For kids these days
5021000	5023000	They were hard, you could save your game and just
5023000	5025000	Screw up, you had to start all the way over
5025000	5027000	That stuff doesn't fly now
5027000	5029000	And for it to be a true King's Quest
5029000	5031000	Or Space Quest game, it would need to be hard
5031000	5033000	As hell, you would need to be able to
5033000	5035000	You know?
5035000	5037000	You didn't fail, sorry
5037000	5039000	You didn't throw the boot at the cat
5039000	5041000	So now the mouse isn't gonna rescue you
5041000	5043000	In King's Quest V, so lol, 15 hours of your life
5043000	5045000	You have to do over
5045000	5047000	That won't fly anymore
5047000	5049000	That's true
5049000	5051000	Everybody wants the easy button now
5051000	5053000	Alright, well if you want to go
5053000	5055000	See how we had it when we were young
5055000	5057000	You ungrateful kids, go check out
5057000	5059000	King's Quest IV, The Perils of Rosella
5059000	5061000	Because it was just one of the best
5061000	5063000	King's Quest games they ever did
5063000	5065000	I believe this was ported to a variety of consoles
5065000	5067000	It's not just PC
5067000	5069000	I mean, clearly the PC is the best one
5069000	5071000	But if you must, I believe it was on the NES
5071000	5073000	Wasn't it?
5073000	5075000	V was, V was ported
5075000	5077000	I thought IV was on the NES too
5077000	5079000	Yeah, V was the one
5079000	5081000	Also, you can get the King's Quest collection
5081000	5083000	And Space Quest collection on Steam
5083000	5085000	It comes with DOSBox
5085000	5087000	Which is that sort of indie MS-DOS
5087000	5089000	Emulator that's fully inclusive of all that
5089000	5091000	Stuff that will run on Windows 7
5091000	5093000	That includes, of course
5093000	5095000	This game, King's Quest IV
5095000	5097000	For about 20 bucks on Steam
5097000	5099000	For whatever reason, it's never
5099000	5101000	On sale, so I think the licensing
5101000	5103000	For it is very bare bones
5103000	5105000	Where Activision is like, here's this
5105000	5107000	DOSBox emulated
5107000	5109000	Comp of these old ass games
5109000	5111000	And we're not letting you put it on sale
5111000	5113000	Ever
5113000	5115000	Steam never really
5115000	5117000	Features it on the RPG page
5117000	5119000	You have to literally search for it in the Steam client
5119000	5121000	King's Quest collection
5121000	5123000	But you can get it, yeah
5123000	5125000	If anybody's still using GameTap, I think a lot of those games
5125000	5127000	Are on there too
5127000	5129000	Good old games, GOG might have some of these too
5129000	5131000	Yeah, absolutely
5131000	5133000	Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says, Westwood also put out
5133000	5135000	The Chirandia series of adventure games
5135000	5137000	Just reminded me of another great series
5137000	5139000	That was one Loki really liked too, if I remember right
5139000	5141000	Yes, I did
5141000	5143000	Specifically Chirandia, The Hands of Fate
5143000	5145000	Alright, well that's gonna do it for our
5145000	5147000	Classic game of the week
5147000	5149000	Very good pick, Alan, very well done
5149000	5151000	I'm sure DarkSakura would be proud
5151000	5153000	We'll ask her when she gets back
5153000	5155000	But we are gonna take a quick break, but don't worry
5155000	5157000	There's plenty more OLR to come
5157000	5159000	We're gonna get to some rapid fire news

5206000	5208000	She makes it back before the end of the show
5208000	5210000	So we can ask her about that a little bit, but joining
5210000	5212000	Us here in studio tonight filling in is Salacious Pop

5266000	5268000	I'm gonna try and hammer out the
5268000	5270000	Details, I don't know exactly
5270000	5272000	How that's gonna work cause I gotta make sure if
5272000	5274000	It's gonna be at all games we have to respect
5274000	5276000	There are other shows that already have time slots
5276000	5278000	So we're gonna try to make that happen
5278000	5280000	This week
5280000	5282000	One off thing, we're not always live though, and if you like
5282000	5284000	That, Xtafer is my co-host

5302000	5304000	Alright, let's move on to some quick news
5304000	5306000	And we'll get to Twitter topics
5306000	5308000	In just a minute, so last call for some Twitter topics
5308000	5310000	At Twitter.com slash
5310000	5312000	O-L-R while we do some rapid fire news
5312000	5314000	As part of that
5314000	5316000	Whole Mega Man
5316000	5318000	Legends 3 meta thing that they have going on
5318000	5320000	Where basically the fans
5320000	5322000	Decide
5322000	5324000	You know
5324000	5326000	Different aspects of Mega Man
5326000	5328000	Well it came down to voice actresses
5328000	5330000	Or actors
5330000	5332000	For the Mega Man role
5332000	5334000	And it was up to the vote
5334000	5336000	Of fans and 3000 people voted
5336000	5338000	And it looks like
5338000	5340000	That your Mega Man voice
5340000	5342000	Actress is going to be
5342000	5344000	Akimi Kondra
5344000	5346000	And I guess
5346000	5348000	She was the voice actress
5348000	5350000	That did work in
5350000	5352000	Mega Man X command mission
5352000	5354000	And powered up, and I guess she's also
5354000	5356000	Done work in Persona 4, Fatal Frame 2
5356000	5358000	And Clonad
5358000	5360000	That's pretty cool
5360000	5362000	And I guess Mega Man Legends 3
5362000	5364000	Is headed to the 3DS
5364000	5366000	Another reason to own a 3DS
5366000	5368000	Fucking Mega Man
5368000	5370000	Legends
5372000	5374000	The Dreamcast collection
5374000	5376000	Something that's been rumored for a while
5376000	5378000	Is actually coming out on PC
5378000	5380000	And Xbox 360
5380000	5382000	This February
5382000	5384000	I gotta admit though it's not too exciting
5384000	5386000	It's really just a collection of
5386000	5388000	The titles that are coming out on Xbox Live
5388000	5390000	Arcade
5390000	5392000	Crazy Taxi, Sonic Adventure
5392000	5394000	Sega Bass Fishing, and Space Channel 5
5394000	5396000	Part 2
5396000	5398000	To enhance up res graphics
5400000	5402000	Apparently it's going to retail for $30
5402000	5404000	And it'll be out on
5404000	5406000	February 22nd
5408000	5410000	Is that something that you'd be interested in
5410000	5412000	Rob, since you know it does have Space Channel 5
5412000	5414000	Of course, I hella want
5414000	5416000	Space Channel 5
5416000	5418000	I wouldn't buy the collection, I'd just buy
5418000	5420000	Space Channel 5 when it comes out on
5420000	5422000	Xbox Live Arcade
5422000	5424000	That's what made my ears perk up
5424000	5426000	Because
5426000	5428000	Sonic Adventure, I heard that port wasn't
5428000	5430000	Very good, Crazy Taxi's missing a lot of the
5430000	5432000	License stuff, Sonic Adventure just wasn't very good
5432000	5434000	So, you can port it all you want
5434000	5436000	It's Sega Bass Fishing, I just
5436000	5438000	Don't give a shit about that, so you know
5438000	5440000	Um
5440000	5442000	And this is a
5442000	5444000	Juicy rumor here, apparently
5444000	5446000	You know, the uh
5446000	5448000	Well actually
5448000	5450000	I'm jumping ahead here, you are a little bit
5450000	5452000	Sorry, must have missed the link
5452000	5454000	There, no, this is actually a juicy
5454000	5456000	Rumor, it's actually coming in the form of
5456000	5458000	Slurpees
5458000	5460000	They're going to be doing some sort of promotion
5460000	5462000	Now with LittleBigPlanet 2 and Killzone 3
5462000	5464000	Where you can go buy Slurpees
5464000	5466000	And at your local
5466000	5468000	7-Eleven
5468000	5470000	And you'll be able to get different
5470000	5472000	I guess
5472000	5474000	Prizes
5474000	5476000	Or codes that you can
5476000	5478000	Redeem for things, they're going to have
5478000	5480000	Strategy guides, premium themes
5480000	5482000	Download content, and more
5482000	5484000	No word if they're
5484000	5486000	Going to actually have any sort of special
5486000	5488000	Flavors to go along with them
5488000	5490000	I almost wanted to stop at
5490000	5492000	7-Eleven on the way here, because it's like
5492000	5494000	Ooh, Slurpee
5494000	5496000	That's good stuff
5498000	5500000	Alright, Slurpees are amazing
5500000	5502000	But lots of calories
5502000	5504000	So for those of you that are trying to do
5504000	5506000	Diets for the new year, I'd stay
5506000	5508000	Away from Slurpees, just saying
5508000	5510000	But they're really good
5510000	5512000	I love the Pina Colada ones
5512000	5514000	Yeah, I was just about to bring that up
5514000	5516000	So gross
5516000	5518000	He'll get the large Slurpee of the flavor
5518000	5520000	I think Coconut is vile
5520000	5522000	So he will get the Pina Colada to guarantee
5522000	5524000	That I won't try to, you know, Bogart it from him
5524000	5526000	I love Coconut, like I love McCroons
5526000	5528000	Are like my favorite cookie ever
5528000	5530000	And then Coconut Cream Pie is so amazing
5530000	5532000	Oh my gosh
5532000	5534000	Coconut's very high in fat though, just saying
5534000	5536000	If I cook something awesome, then I just have to put
5536000	5538000	That'll guarantee that it's mine
5538000	5540000	And Rob won't try to eat it
5540000	5542000	I hate mayonnaise
5542000	5544000	Even today, we were at Panera Bread, Loki's favorite restaurant
5544000	5546000	We decided to go to Panera Bread for the show
5546000	5548000	It's not my favorite restaurant
5548000	5550000	Right here at OLR it is
5550000	5552000	What have I been eating the last two weeks?
5552000	5554000	French onion soup
5554000	5556000	No, I have not been eating French onion soup
5556000	5558000	I have been having
5558000	5560000	Was it a ten piece
5560000	5562000	The Honey Hot BBQ Wings
5562000	5564000	From KFC
5564000	5566000	With a giant root beer
5566000	5568000	Without ice, because I do not want my
5568000	5570000	Root beer watered down by crappy ice
5570000	5572000	How dare they
5572000	5574000	How dare they steal some of my
5574000	5576000	Precious root beer room with ice
5576000	5578000	I don't know what it is
5578000	5580000	But A&W from an A&W
5580000	5582000	Or even the combination KFC A&W
5582000	5584000	Like they have out here is so much better
5584000	5586000	Than the ones at the store, I can't explain it
5586000	5588000	A&W from the tap is so much better
5588000	5590000	They sell them in gallon jugs
5590000	5592000	I swear to god
5592000	5594000	I can drink a half gallon
5594000	5596000	I can do it
5596000	5598000	I've seen them
5598000	5600000	They are seriously
5600000	5602000	It's a sight to behold
5602000	5604000	I tell you man
5604000	5606000	I took Salacious Pop to Panera for the first time today
5606000	5608000	He really liked it
5608000	5610000	I guess they don't have them in his neck of the woods
5610000	5612000	Kind of a new thing
5612000	5614000	People on Facebook have said there is a bunch around me
5614000	5616000	But in the neighborhood I'm in there aren't any
5616000	5618000	I've never seen one
5618000	5620000	What's ironic is
5620000	5622000	It took the place of a Krispy Kreme
5622000	5624000	It's kind of one extreme to the other
5624000	5626000	I know and that is crime right there
5626000	5628000	Really they should have just
5628000	5630000	They should have tore down another restaurant
5630000	5632000	Get rid of the Wendy's
5632000	5634000	Wendy's sucks and everything
5634000	5636000	Alright let's get back to gaming news
5636000	5638000	Yet again the food topic
5638000	5640000	I don't even know what to say
5640000	5642000	We have a release date for PlayStation Move Heroes
5642000	5644000	It's March 22nd
5644000	5646000	Some bonuses that come with the reservations
5646000	5648000	Depending on where you reserve it
5648000	5650000	Amazon and Gamestop
5650000	5652000	You can get a skin pack with Pirate Sly
5652000	5654000	Freedom League Jack and
5654000	5656000	Trillium Armor Ratchet
5656000	5658000	Is all the special stuff you can get there
5658000	5660000	Apparently quote
5660000	5662000	There's also a full story surrounding the game
5662000	5664000	And why they're all together
5664000	5666000	That is from Christian Cardona
5666000	5668000	The marketing manager of the game
5668000	5670000	PlayStation Move Heroes
5670000	5672000	I have yet to buy a PlayStation Move
5672000	5674000	Super Street Fighter 4 3D
5674000	5676000	Is coming out of course on the 3DS
5676000	5678000	Online multiplayer
5678000	5680000	That's pretty neat
5680000	5682000	There was a whole little trailer too that hit the internet this week
5682000	5684000	That was showing some of the features like that
5684000	5686000	But there's also going to be worldwide online play
5686000	5688000	And what's called channel live
5688000	5690000	You can just watch live matches
5690000	5692000	And channel live if you want to watch the pros do their thing
5692000	5694000	There's also figurine collecting
5694000	5696000	And random street fighting modes
5696000	5698000	If you want to do that
5698000	5700000	That's that whole using the aware thing
5700000	5702000	As you walk by people
5702000	5704000	I guess your character can fight somebody else
5704000	5706000	That's going to be a pretty big launch title
5706000	5708000	Even though most of us have already played Super Street Fighter 4
5708000	5710000	My question is
5710000	5712000	And maybe this has already been answered somewhere
5712000	5714000	I just haven't seen it
5714000	5716000	How has the character roster been affected by the move to the 3DS
5716000	5718000	I mean surely they had to cut some characters out right
5718000	5720000	Or did they not
5720000	5722000	Wow that's pretty amazing
5722000	5724000	The videos and the YouTubes that have been out of this game
5724000	5726000	Have blown my mind on how good it looks
5726000	5728000	So if for it to look that good
5728000	5730000	If they cut a few characters
5730000	5732000	In order for that to happen I do not mind
5732000	5734000	There's some awesome stuff coming out on that game right now
5734000	5736000	Yeah I'm trying to see if there's a 3DS thing
5736000	5738000	Let's see
5738000	5740000	It's coming out, it has Wi-Fi
5740000	5744000	It has all 35 console characters plus
5744000	5746000	Yeah all of them are going to be on the 3DS release
5746000	5750000	It's been called exactly the same as its HD counterparts by Capcom
5750000	5752000	That's pretty amazing
5752000	5754000	You can set up four hotkeys
5754000	5756000	For moves and combos on the touch screen
5756000	5758000	That's kind of interesting
5758000	5760000	Can I go on the tangent train a little bit?
5760000	5762000	Of course
5762000	5764000	I really hope that this generation of handhelds
5764000	5768000	Be it the 3DS or the PSP2
5768000	5774000	Uses more of the infrastructure central server style of multiplayer
5774000	5778000	Because the last few generations
5778000	5780000	Obviously you've got the Game Boy Advance with the link up cable
5780000	5782000	That was the last generation that used that
5782000	5784000	With the PSP and the DS
5784000	5786000	It's all ad hoc
5786000	5788000	I don't know that many people that have a PSP
5788000	5790000	Where I can be in the same room with them
5790000	5792000	And do ad hoc connect
5792000	5794000	So I really want this generation
5794000	5796000	Super Street Fighter 4 3DS
5796000	5798000	To have the central server
5798000	5800000	And I know with the PS3 and the PSP
5800000	5802000	You can do the tethering
5802000	5804000	But that's still just too cumbersome for me
5804000	5806000	It's too much of a pain in the ass I agree
5806000	5808000	So I love handhelds
5808000	5810000	But I'll never play ad hoc support
5810000	5812000	Because I don't know that many friends with them
5812000	5814000	So that's all
5814000	5816000	Let's talk about another fighting game on the 3DS
5816000	5818000	Dead or Alive Dimensions
5818000	5820000	It's kind of interesting because they've talked about
5820000	5822000	This game is going to have 30 frames a second and 60 frames a second
5822000	5826000	It just depends on if you're playing 3D or 2D
5826000	5828000	So if you're playing in 3D mode
5828000	5830000	You only get 30 frames a second per eye
5830000	5832000	But if you decide to condense it down to 2D
5832000	5834000	You'll get a 60 frames a second fighter
5834000	5836000	That's kind of interesting
5836000	5838000	I mean it makes sense too
5838000	5840000	Because obviously 3D is rendering one frame
5840000	5842000	And then another really fast back and forth
5842000	5844000	In rapid succession
5844000	5846000	They look pretty good in 3D
5846000	5848000	But that's pretty cool that if you get sick of 3D
5848000	5850000	There's kind of like a little perk if you will
5850000	5852000	To play in 2D
5852000	5854000	Kind of neat
5854000	5856000	I'm sure a lot of games are like that by the way
5856000	5858000	Yeah same with Street Fighter IV on there
5858000	5860000	Because they have that really funky view that you can do
5860000	5862000	That gives it more depth
5862000	5864000	But if you don't want to do that
5864000	5866000	You don't have to do that
5866000	5868000	Salacious Pop has a few stories for us
5868000	5870000	Then we're going to get to the Twitter topics
5870000	5872000	Real quick though
5872000	5874000	It seems to be kind of smart in Nintendo's part
5874000	5876000	At least, well I don't know if it's Nintendo's part
5876000	5878000	But as far as like
5878000	5880000	The games that are coming out launched
5880000	5882000	You know for it and stuff
5882000	5884000	It seems to be kind of quite a variety
5884000	5886000	It's not all like, oh it's Mario this
5886000	5888000	Or you know Zelda this
5888000	5890000	And all kitty stuff
5890000	5892000	It's like we've got some hardcore fighters in there
5892000	5894000	We've got a little bit of
5894000	5896000	You know the Nintendogs kind of crap
5896000	5898000	And a little bit of
5898000	5900000	Something for everybody
5900000	5902000	I think that's pretty awesome
5904000	5906000	Indeed, it sounds like it's going to have
5906000	5908000	A pretty good lineup at the beginning
5908000	5910000	I hope the price is reasonable
5910000	5912000	We'll see pretty soon though
5912000	5914000	Alright Salacious Pop
5914000	5916000	Okay
5916000	5918000	For my quick fire stories
5918000	5920000	Those of you who wanted to play
5920000	5922000	Pac-Man Battle Royale
5922000	5924000	The Return to Form
5924000	5926000	Pac-Man arcade game multiplayer
5926000	5928000	That is now available to
5928000	5930000	American arcade distributors
5930000	5932000	So that means that whatever arcade
5932000	5934000	If you're fortunate enough to live in an area
5934000	5936000	That still has one
5936000	5938000	They can have it
5938000	5940000	It's a cocktail style cabinet
5940000	5942000	You know the old pizza parlor
5942000	5944000	Model to set your drink on it
5944000	5946000	So it's the flat glass
5946000	5948000	Coming soon to Dave and Busters everywhere I'm sure
5948000	5950000	Yeah
5950000	5952000	According to the source of the article
5952000	5954000	Arcade Heroes
5954000	5956000	It's currently being sold
5956000	5958000	For $4,275
5958000	5960000	To the arcade businesses
5960000	5962000	That might want to get it and put it in the store
5962000	5964000	Or in their arcade
5964000	5966000	Which apparently is cheaper
5966000	5968000	Than most of the other stuff
5968000	5970000	Most arcade games right now that are popular
5970000	5972000	Are the ticket spitters
5972000	5974000	And the big time crisis
5974000	5976000	The huge shoot-em-up
5976000	5978000	Arcade games
5978000	5980000	So the Pac-Man
5980000	5982000	Battle Royale cocktail cabinet
5982000	5984000	A little over $4,000 I guess
5984000	5986000	For a new arcade machine
5986000	5988000	So yeah
5988000	5990000	Pac-Man fans look for that in your arcade
5990000	5992000	Starting hopefully as soon as this month
5992000	5994000	Because it's out there for us to buy it
5994000	5996000	So
5996000	5998000	Next
5998000	6000000	The domain name
6000000	6004000	FinalFantasy13-2game.com
6004000	6006000	Has been registered by Squeenix
6006000	6008000	So everyone's all
6008000	6010000	Freaking out about what this means
6010000	6012000	Maybe Lightning is going to become a pop singer
6012000	6014000	Just like What's-Her-Name
6014000	6016000	Final Fantasy X
6016000	6018000	So yeah
6018000	6020000	That was registered
6020000	6022000	Along with a bunch of other domains
6022000	6024000	For their
6024000	6026000	N-I-E-R
6026000	6028000	Nier
6028000	6030000	Nier and Mindjack
6030000	6032000	So a bunch of domains were registered
6032000	6034000	For those properties
6034000	6036000	Square is holding a
6036000	6038000	First production
6038000	6040000	Party premiere event in Japan
6040000	6042000	For two days on the 18th
6042000	6044000	So people are like what titles
6044000	6046000	And little side story
6046000	6048000	Projects are they going to announce
6048000	6050000	Maybe we'll finally get to see something from
6050000	6052000	Final Fantasy 13 Versus
6052000	6054000	Which very well could be just being released here
6054000	6056000	As Final Fantasy 13-2
6056000	6058000	Versus 13 for the PS3
6058000	6060000	And then the Fabula
6060000	6062000	The PSP
6062000	6064000	Part of the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy
6064000	6066000	Those two titles are still
6066000	6068000	I don't want to call them vaporware
6068000	6070000	We know that they exist
6070000	6072000	So there's that
6072000	6074000	Maybe we'll find out about
6074000	6076000	Kingdom Hearts 3
6076000	6078000	Maybe
6078000	6080000	Maybe we'll find out
6080000	6082000	That would be a great E3 announcement though
6082000	6084000	Final Fantasy 7
6084000	6086000	Remake maybe
6086000	6088000	I'm just flame baiting at this point
6088000	6090000	Maybe we'll find out about Final Fantasy 14
6090000	6092000	Do-Over
6092000	6094000	The Do-Over expansion
6094000	6096000	If they said they were doing Final Fantasy 6
6096000	6098000	The 3DS
6098000	6100000	Then I would
6100000	6102000	That would be enough for me
6102000	6104000	So Square is having some event in two days
6104000	6106000	And they registered 13-2 game
6106000	6108000	Final Fantasy 13-2.com
6108000	6110000	So speculate to your heart's content
6112000	6114000	Last quick fire story for me
6114000	6116000	Is that some of the retail
6116000	6118000	Marketing assets
6118000	6120000	For Marvel versus Capcom 3
6120000	6122000	Have Akuma
6122000	6124000	On them as a playable character
6124000	6126000	It's just a print
6126000	6128000	Assets for the game
6128000	6130000	And I guess apparently Akuma
6130000	6132000	Hasn't been really made official
6132000	6134000	On that roster
6134000	6136000	Well I would kind of think duh Akuma is in it
6136000	6138000	But I guess this is the first time we've seen
6138000	6140000	Akuma in print material
6140000	6142000	For MVC 3
6142000	6144000	Geez do we have the full roster yet?
6144000	6146000	Because it seems like every week there's some damn story about
6146000	6148000	Oh this character is in it
6148000	6150000	Well in this little
6150000	6152000	Sample graphic here it's got Akuma
6152000	6154000	On Bonn which we already knew about
6154000	6156000	Albert Wesker, I don't know if I knew about him
6156000	6158000	Yeah he was announced
6158000	6160000	A while ago. And then Arthur of course
6160000	6162000	From Ghosts and Goblins
6162000	6164000	So yeah
6164000	6166000	So we know that Akuma
6166000	6168000	Is at least in print material for the game
6168000	6170000	So maybe he's unlockable
6170000	6172000	But he's in there
6172000	6174000	Alright we'll see
6174000	6176000	For now let's go to the Twitter
6176000	6178000	We're going to get some tweets
6178000	6180000	Every week we ask you guys to show us your tweets
6180000	6182000	At twitter.com slash o-l-r
6182000	6184000	And we're going to read some messages
6184000	6186000	Sent to us right now
6186000	6188000	We'll start off with Spassinator PSN
6188000	6190000	Send us a couple tweets here
6190000	6192000	There's been a ton of free stuff put onto the PSN
6192000	6194000	Video store lately
6194000	6196000	The usual spot so be sure to check it out
6196000	6198000	So if you like free videos
6198000	6200000	You can check that out
6200000	6202000	Hopefully your console doesn't get borked if you try to hack it
6202000	6204000	And then you'll lose that rights to all that video content
6204000	6206000	So be careful
6206000	6208000	Retertainment, I like this tweet
6208000	6210000	Which console would compete better on Jeopardy?
6210000	6212000	The 360
6212000	6214000	The PS3
6214000	6216000	Or the Wii
6216000	6218000	Cause you know if you haven't heard there's that whole computer
6218000	6220000	That's going on Jeopardy that's supposed to be doing battle
6220000	6222000	Against what like Ken Jennings
6222000	6224000	And I don't know somebody else
6224000	6226000	Whatever
6226000	6228000	So I don't know, what do you guys think?
6228000	6230000	Which console would compete best on Jeopardy?
6230000	6232000	I would guess the Playstation 3
6232000	6234000	Because of that whole
6234000	6236000	Uber chip that's inside it
6236000	6238000	It's kind of got the best
6238000	6240000	Computer parts
6240000	6242000	If you will
6242000	6244000	Well the 360 would call Alex Trebek a fag
6244000	6246000	And then the panel would go red
6246000	6248000	The right on screen
6248000	6250000	It would go red and then it would just sit there
6250000	6252000	For the rest of the show
6252000	6254000	And Alex Trebek would be like
6254000	6256000	So yeah
6256000	6258000	And then the Wii
6258000	6260000	The Wii couldn't even connect to the internet
6260000	6262000	To be able to play the game
6262000	6264000	I'm gonna say the PS3
6264000	6266000	Act Def sends us a link to a story
6266000	6268000	About a video game pirate trades
6268000	6270000	Sales for Steam
6270000	6272000	It's a link to a story on Kotaku
6272000	6274000	About a video game pirate who has reformed
6274000	6276000	And wrote this whole story
6276000	6278000	I'm not gonna read the whole damn story
6278000	6280000	But he you know
6280000	6282000	Wrote this whole little piece for Kotaku
6282000	6284000	And talked about how he was a pirate
6284000	6286000	And a thief and so forth
6288000	6290000	He said near the end of 2010
6290000	6292000	He had stopped playing PC games all together
6292000	6294000	And if he ended up liking a game
6294000	6296000	He wouldn't even bother to order it
6296000	6298000	He'd just keep playing it until he beat it and then move on
6298000	6300000	Then Steam I guess changed his mind
6300000	6302000	He has been a user on Steam for five years
6302000	6304000	And then
6304000	6306000	He would I guess wake up during the holiday sale
6306000	6308000	And see what games he's going to buy
6308000	6310000	Having the convenience of Steam
6310000	6312000	To download games right there
6312000	6314000	Was enough for him
6314000	6316000	He bought 22 games over the course of the sale
6316000	6318000	There you go
6318000	6320000	I guess the 3DS too is something else that's
6320000	6322000	Making him reform
6322000	6324000	You can read the whole piece there on Kotaku
6324000	6326000	Another link sent to us on Twitter
6326000	6328000	From SJ100Matt says
6328000	6330000	It's a link about a group of fans remaking
6330000	6332000	Sonic 2 in HD
6332000	6334000	This is yet another one of those things
6334000	6336000	Where I remember one of these
6336000	6338000	Not that long ago there was a story about
6338000	6340000	A Sonic game that was being like remade
6340000	6342000	Or like a whole new HD Sonic game
6342000	6344000	That looked better than Sonic 4
6344000	6346000	I think Jamie had the story
6346000	6348000	And she was reporting on it
6348000	6350000	And what Sega's putting out
6350000	6352000	And now there's this whole little teaser on YouTube
6352000	6354000	I guess for a remade
6354000	6356000	Sonic 2 in HD
6356000	6358000	Now it just looks like old school Sonic
6358000	6360000	But in widescreen and high def
6360000	6362000	It looks great
6362000	6364000	Why the fuck isn't this on Xbox Live?
6366000	6368000	I can't
6368000	6370000	I love how all the fans
6370000	6372000	Try to one-up Sega though
6372000	6374000	It's like at what point does
6374000	6376000	Flattery become insult
6376000	6378000	Like seriously I don't even know
6378000	6380000	Defective Candy sends us a tweet
6380000	6382000	The first kinetic app
6382000	6384000	Has shown up in the Mac App Store
6384000	6386000	It's called the Connect 3D Viewer
6386000	6388000	App and you can plug the USB Connect
6388000	6390000	Into the app
6390000	6392000	I'm sorry into your Mac and you get a
6392000	6394000	3D visualization of the depth
6394000	6396000	Data you can also map
6396000	6398000	RGB values on the image
6398000	6400000	You can zoom and rotate the
6400000	6402000	Visualization so it kind of looks like an
6402000	6404000	Old school like Max Headroom thing from the 80's
6404000	6406000	In this little clip you see there
6406000	6408000	Yeah now that the Mac App Store is open
6408000	6410000	People are putting all sorts of creative things
6410000	6412000	Up on there so that's interesting
6412000	6414000	If I had a Mac I'd probably be checking that out
6414000	6416000	Unfortunately I only have an iPhone
6416000	6418000	And I can't hook up my connect to my iPhone
6418000	6420000	Let's see
6420000	6422000	Tigerclaw305 on Twitter sends us a few
6422000	6424000	Tweets, one of them has to do
6424000	6426000	This whole thing about the
6426000	6428000	Hacking of the Playstation 3
6428000	6430000	Apparently there's something going on there that's threatening the
6430000	6432000	Trophy system
6432000	6434000	The PS3 Unlocker is this app that's out there
6434000	6436000	You can only use it on a jailbroken
6436000	6438000	Console and I guess what happens is that
6438000	6440000	You can actually unlock trophies for
6440000	6442000	Buzz, Quiz, TV, Disc
6442000	6444000	You get 100% of the trophies
6444000	6446000	But not every game works like Resident Evil 5
6446000	6448000	Gold Edition and Batman Arkham Asylum
6448000	6450000	Don't work yet
6450000	6452000	So wow
6452000	6454000	That sucks actually
6454000	6456000	For Sony if that happens
6456000	6458000	Because there's just going to be so many people
6458000	6460000	That abuse that and it's too bad
6460000	6462000	They could easily ban those people
6462000	6464000	That do that. They do that for Xbox
6464000	6466000	Live right now because you can do that already
6466000	6468000	With JTAG consoles
6468000	6470000	But I mean
6470000	6472000	You can tell
6472000	6474000	Usually you can tell
6474000	6476000	Hey he has a 2 million
6476000	6478000	Gamer score
6478000	6480000	That's a little weird
6480000	6482000	Probably a little high
6482000	6484000	I enjoy metagaming and the whole
6484000	6486000	Semi-EP'ing achievement point thing
6486000	6488000	WoW has it, Xbox has it
6488000	6490000	I think it's neat but I just
6490000	6492000	Can't imagine who is taking this seriously
6492000	6494000	Enough to where they want to hack themselves
6494000	6496000	Up into the 50,000 score
6496000	6498000	So they can go hey look at my gamer card
6498000	6500000	Look at my score
6500000	6502000	Who is that person because I want to meet them and maybe
6502000	6504000	Push them down some stairs
6504000	6506000	Yeah I mean it's like you know
6506000	6508000	Big fucking deal, like woo
6508000	6510000	You unlocked everything and you did it by cheating
6510000	6512000	It's unfortunate
6512000	6514000	Someone who does it legitimately
6514000	6516000	Gets some really cool
6516000	6518000	Achievement but you know
6518000	6520000	The person who unlocks the most
6520000	6522000	Maximum achievements in one game
6522000	6524000	Isn't good at every single game
6524000	6526000	And that's okay
6526000	6528000	It's just like in the Olympics the same competitors
6528000	6530000	Don't do every single sport
6530000	6532000	Unless you're looking at something like the Decathlon
6532000	6534000	But that's different
6534000	6536000	And XBLA will occasionally feature
6536000	6538000	A gamer on Xbox Live that has a really
6538000	6540000	High number, sometimes it'll be
6540000	6542000	An Iraqi vet
6542000	6544000	That's now disabled and they play Xbox
6544000	6546000	With a 50,000 XBLA score
6546000	6548000	And that's interesting to find out about the people
6548000	6550000	That have numbers that high because they just
6550000	6552000	Play that much
6552000	6554000	And a hack like this kind of takes away from
6554000	6556000	The few people that you know
6556000	6558000	Have made a name for themselves out of metagaming
6558000	6560000	So yeah
6560000	6562000	So stopping a dick basically folks
6562000	6564000	This is just a dick thing to do is to unlock all the trophies
6564000	6566000	That you didn't earn
6566000	6568000	Dick, alright
6568000	6570000	Moving on to another tweet, the last tweet tonight
6570000	6572000	Also from Tigerclaw
6572000	6574000	I guess is going on there
6574000	6576000	Epic Games has an upcoming first person shooter
6576000	6578000	Called Bulletstorm
6578000	6580000	I guess the Xbox Live and Playstation Network
6580000	6582000	Demo is coming out on January 25th
6582000	6584000	If you want to check this out and see if this is the game for you
6584000	6586000	The demo will have
6586000	6588000	Usage of the echo mode
6588000	6590000	It's a score based mode in the game
6590000	6592000	Where you can use skill shots
6592000	6594000	And so forth
6594000	6596000	45 of the game skill shots will be in there
6596000	6598000	As well as a range of weapons
6598000	6600000	So it sounds like you'll be able to get a pretty good taste for the game there
6600000	6602000	We'll get into stores
6602000	6604000	On February 22nd
6604000	6606000	And there you go
6606000	6608000	We got one more tweet to us
6608000	6610000	From DarkSakura on Twitter
6610000	6612000	Tweets us saying
6612000	6614000	Why you so hot?
6614000	6616000	I don't know if she's listening
6616000	6618000	On the mobile thing
6618000	6620000	If you have an iPhone or whatever
6620000	6622000	You can just go to allgames.com
6622000	6624000	And it's like HTML5 now
6624000	6626000	You don't need an app anymore
6626000	6628000	There used to be an app, you don't need it anymore
6628000	6630000	You can listen to all games while you're on the road
6630000	6632000	So she might be doing that
6632000	6634000	So hi Jamie if you're listening
6634000	6636000	They're really close
6636000	6638000	She's at the IKEA, that's only 20 minutes away
6638000	6640000	So she's going to make it
6640000	6642000	Probably just in time for phone calls
6642000	6644000	But I think you're doing a fabulous job
6644000	6646000	So you would make DarkSakura very proud
6646000	6648000	I want to do this last story before
6648000	6650000	Well let's hurry up and get there
6650000	6652000	Because we're through Twitter topics
6652000	6654000	So we've got a couple more stories here
6654000	6656000	We'll go to Loki
6656000	6660000	Ah yes, so we were talking a little bit about
6660000	6662000	The 3DS and stuff
6662000	6664000	Of course not all of the news is great
6664000	6668000	They're going to be first off
6668000	6670000	Region locking the console
6670000	6672000	Which is not a huge surprise
6672000	6675000	Because the DSi, at least the DSiWare part
6675000	6677000	Was actually region locked
6677000	6679000	But now they've kind of gone against
6679000	6682000	What they've been doing with the NDS and stuff
6682000	6684000	And they're just locking the console
6684000	6686000	As I said before in our first story
6686000	6690000	You're just giving the hackers another excuse
6690000	6692000	To try to crack your system
6692000	6694000	Because now instead of like
6694000	6696000	Oh I want to install Linux on it
6696000	6698000	Now they're like, well I want to play games for other regions
6698000	6700000	So I'm going to hack this
6700000	6702000	And this is going to be my justification for doing that
6702000	6704000	So
6704000	6706000	I don't know, it sucks
6706000	6708000	It says
6708000	6710000	It looks like, for example
6710000	6712000	If you play a Korean 3DS game
6712000	6714000	With a Japanese 3DS system
6714000	6716000	Or vice versa
6716000	6718000	You won't be able to play it at all
6718000	6720000	Nintendo hasn't actually
6720000	6722000	Responded to the comment
6722000	6724000	About it
6724000	6726000	But they haven't really said it
6726000	6728000	It says there's no region codes in DS and DS Lite
6728000	6730000	But the DSi, DSi Excel
6730000	6732000	And 3DS have region codes
6732000	6734000	Region codes are installed in each game
6734000	6736000	And the 3DS itself
6736000	6738000	You can't play if the region
6738000	6740000	Codes are different
6740000	6742000	That's kind of lame
6742000	6744000	Boot of that
6744000	6746000	Region locking sucks
6746000	6748000	I hate it
6748000	6750000	It's what drove me to piracy
6750000	6752000	On the PS1
6752000	6754000	Was wanting to play import Japanese games
6754000	6756000	And I couldn't do it
6756000	6758000	Just being honest
6758000	6760000	And then of course they're talking about
6760000	6762000	Being a little bit more consistent
6762000	6764000	With their first party releases for the 3DS
6764000	6766000	They were saying that
6766000	6768000	With the Nintendo DS right now
6768000	6770000	They're not having
6770000	6772000	I don't know, I think they're doing pretty good
6772000	6774000	With the titles that they have coming out
6774000	6776000	They have about one or two titles
6776000	6778000	A month from
6778000	6780000	Actually Nintendo
6780000	6782000	Or maybe it's like one or two titles every few months
6782000	6784000	Because I know, let's see
6784000	6786000	Dragon Quest
6786000	6788000	Is being published by Nintendo
6788000	6790000	And then Pokemon Black and White
6790000	6792000	And then they've got
6792000	6794000	I guess they have a first party
6794000	6796000	Wii title for January
6796000	6798000	But they do have Mario Sports Mix
6798000	6800000	For February
6800000	6802000	But they're saying that they're going to be
6802000	6804000	Working to
6804000	6806000	Have a more consistent release schedule
6806000	6808000	For games
6808000	6810000	So maybe something like once a month
6810000	6812000	And
6812000	6814000	That's kind of cool
6814000	6816000	And they're also targeting other regions
6816000	6818000	As well
6818000	6820000	Developing countries additional to its current
6820000	6822000	Territories to bring the new handheld
6822000	6824000	The new console to
6824000	6826000	That's good for people
6826000	6828000	That haven't had a lot of
6828000	6830000	Console games, maybe Brazil
6830000	6832000	Or
6832000	6834000	South America and there's some places
6834000	6836000	Down there that could use
6836000	6838000	Some new consoles
6838000	6840000	I'm excited to hear
6840000	6842000	That they might have more of a
6842000	6844000	Constant stream of games
6844000	6846000	It seemed like with the DS it was like
6846000	6848000	Especially right after launch
6848000	6850000	I seem to remember a lot of games didn't come out
6850000	6852000	Almost for a year for the DS
6852000	6854000	Here's my thing though
6854000	6856000	Are we going to actually get
6856000	6858000	New games
6858000	6860000	Or is this going to be like
6860000	6862000	Oh yeah and we're porting this
6862000	6864000	We make some N64 and GameCube games
6864000	6866000	Over and over and over again
6866000	6868000	Look we got
6868000	6870000	Super Mario All Stars
6870000	6872000	There's third party developers though
6872000	6874000	And I'm sort of counting on them to not do that to us
6874000	6876000	If that makes sense
6876000	6878000	The Kingdom Hearts game looks interesting
6878000	6880000	And there's plenty others
6880000	6882000	Street Fighter 4 looks like it might be the biggest
6882000	6884000	Launch game of sorts
6884000	6886000	And I got to admit, how sad is this you guys
6886000	6888000	I don't even want to
6888000	6890000	Admit this
6890000	6892000	I kind of want the Nintendogs plus cats
6892000	6894000	And I don't know why
6894000	6896000	No I do know why, I want the cats
6896000	6898000	I'm not going to buy all three versions like Logie does, no way
6898000	6900000	No I'm not doing that either
6900000	6902000	I learned my lesson the hard way
6902000	6904000	You're not even going to buy one version this time
6904000	6906000	I'm not buying one
6906000	6908000	Well this will make a lot of people even more excited
6908000	6910000	With the 3DS, like I really wish they would do this
6910000	6912000	And I don't know why
6912000	6914000	Let me explain, here it is
6914000	6916000	Nintendo did an interview with Satoru Iwata
6916000	6918000	Called the Iwata Asks interview
6918000	6920000	Iwata-san also
6920000	6922000	Wants to include 3D video in the future
6922000	6924000	That's what Miyamoto had said
6924000	6926000	Iwata said quote
6926000	6928000	I think it would be fun if we were able to include
6928000	6930000	Video recording capabilities with future updates
6930000	6932000	That means it's not going to be there on release
6932000	6934000	But perhaps in the future
6934000	6936000	Why?
6936000	6938000	Why not? Let's do it
6938000	6940000	I mean I realize that 3D videos you can't watch them
6940000	6942000	A whole lot of places except maybe oh you're 3DS
6942000	6944000	But I don't know
6944000	6946000	I think that would be kind of cool
6946000	6948000	Like in a way being able to make your own 3D videos
6948000	6950000	Of course give it five seconds and there will be a porno
6950000	6952000	Give it five seconds
6952000	6954000	And there will be a porno on the 3DS
6954000	6956000	But can you imagine if you could do like video sharing
6956000	6958000	Through 3DS
6958000	6960000	Like if Nintendo was smart
6960000	6962000	They would
6962000	6964000	Introduce this whole like
6964000	6966000	Social network file sharing ability
6966000	6968000	Like a portal
6968000	6970000	Where you could share videos with your friends
6970000	6972000	That you make on the 3DS
6972000	6974000	Like my trip to Disneyland
6974000	6976000	They could have a 3D
6976000	6978000	YouTube
6978000	6980000	They could have it if they wanted it
6980000	6982000	Do you realize how big that is?
6982000	6984000	With 3D being all the rage and stuff right now
6984000	6986000	But they don't want it
6986000	6988000	Because they are so bullheaded
6988000	6990000	If Nintendo was smart
6990000	6992000	They would make 3D YouTube
6992000	6994000	Before YouTube can but they won't
6994000	6996000	Actually I think YouTube already has 3D U2
6996000	6998000	But the thing is
6998000	7000000	The difference is
7000000	7002000	Most computers yet aren't set up to do 3D
7002000	7004000	The 3DS
7004000	7006000	It's a camera and it's the viewer
7006000	7008000	All in one
7008000	7010000	Ugh
7010000	7012000	But no
7012000	7014000	They won't do it
7014000	7016000	Yes I'm mad
7016000	7018000	Because Nintendo just
7018000	7020000	They're hard headed
7020000	7022000	Nintendo's hard headed
7022000	7024000	By the way there was also talk about
7024000	7026000	The whole street pass feature
7026000	7028000	As used in Nintendogs plus cats
7028000	7030000	And that was from Hideki Kono
7030000	7032000	Quote, when you're using street pass and exchange data with someone
7032000	7034000	In walk mode
7034000	7036000	That person's me is walking whatever puppy he or she has chosen
7036000	7038000	Then your me's and puppy's talk
7038000	7040000	And exchange gifts
7040000	7042000	That's supposed to be like when people actually meet
7042000	7044000	In the park walking their dogs
7044000	7046000	And what have you
7046000	7048000	Although I've never given another dog walker a gift
7048000	7050000	But anyway that's supposed to be a feature
7050000	7052000	But I don't know I hear about this shit and I go
7052000	7054000	Isn't that what the DS was supposed to do?
7054000	7056000	Like wasn't your DS supposed to have that
7056000	7058000	Always aware thing like what's so special
7058000	7060000	About what the 3DS is doing
7060000	7062000	Do you have to hold the 3DS's in a certain way
7062000	7064000	So they can sniff each other's butts
7064000	7066000	Is that a feature?
7066000	7068000	Maybe I don't know
7068000	7070000	Here's what it is to answer your question
7070000	7072000	Remember before you had to
7072000	7074000	Have a certain game in there and it would
7074000	7076000	Be in that mode or whatever
7076000	7078000	If you had to have Nintendogs in your system
7078000	7080000	And they had to be in the sleep mode or whatever
7080000	7082000	They had to have Nintendogs
7082000	7084000	And it would detect them
7084000	7086000	This will pick up anything regardless of what game it is
7086000	7088000	So say for example I have Mario Kart and Nintendogs
7088000	7090000	And someone else has Mario Kart and Nintendogs
7090000	7092000	But they're playing like
7092000	7094000	Street Fighter 4 or something like that
7094000	7096000	It'll still tag my system
7096000	7098000	With all their other crap
7098000	7100000	There's some clarifications from our chat room
7100000	7102000	At chat.orangemanstrader.com
7102000	7104000	Tigerclaw is clarifying the 3D YouTube videos
7104000	7106000	Are the red and blue
7106000	7108000	If you have the red and blue glasses you can watch some 3D videos
7108000	7110000	On YouTube
7110000	7112000	Yes they have that but there's also the other ones
7112000	7114000	They do have multiple versions of 3D
7114000	7116000	I think there's people making
7116000	7118000	Self-made 3D stuff right now
7118000	7120000	But it's just, it's very limited
7120000	7122000	Azzam in our chat room says
7122000	7124000	Nintendo Smart? That's like PS3 unhackable
7126000	7128000	I see what you did there
7128000	7130000	Alright
7130000	7132000	SalaciousPop what do you have for us?
7132000	7134000	I'm not sure why you put
7134000	7136000	This particular story in the news feed
7136000	7138000	It's amazing
7138000	7140000	Because I used to work in
7140000	7142000	Adult entertainment and I'm sure if
7142000	7144000	Jamie got this story she would just be flustered
7144000	7146000	And annoyed
7146000	7148000	A company named D-Dub Software
7148000	7150000	Is putting out a
7150000	7152000	Porno, triple X rated
7152000	7154000	Indie game called Bonecraft
7154000	7156000	Based off of Blizzard's World of Warcraft lore
7156000	7158000	Where it's like inspired by
7158000	7160000	But obviously it's close enough
7160000	7162000	To where they can't I guess get sued
7162000	7164000	But yeah so D-Dub
7164000	7166000	Software who also put out
7166000	7168000	Games, I'm trying to find
7168000	7170000	Bonetown, Bonetown is another
7170000	7172000	Game of theirs and the Tiger Woods
7172000	7174000	Sex game I guess
7174000	7176000	Plot summary
7176000	7178000	Somewhere in the galaxy there's Orcs and Elves
7178000	7180000	This isn't a direct quote
7180000	7182000	I'm just paraphrasing it because otherwise it would be too long
7182000	7184000	Orcs and Elves running around
7184000	7186000	Space Marines crash land on the
7186000	7188000	Planet and I guess there's something about
7188000	7190000	Secret Elf
7190000	7192000	Brothels and I'm sure
7192000	7194000	You move your mouse up and down
7194000	7196000	To do the sex and I don't even know what this is
7196000	7198000	What is this I don't even
7198000	7200000	But yeah, Bonecraft the World of War
7200000	7202000	Or the Blizzard sort of
7202000	7204000	Starcraft Warcraft genre
7204000	7206000	Porno game
7206000	7208000	I love that it's combining Warcraft
7208000	7210000	And Starcraft together in its parody
7210000	7212000	Yeah so for those that
7212000	7214000	Want to
7214000	7216000	Google that when they're by themselves
7216000	7218000	The door closed, that's
7218000	7220000	And locked, lock it
7220000	7222000	You lock the door
7222000	7224000	D-Dub Software
7224000	7226000	And the game is a Bonecraft
7226000	7228000	So that's some lol's for you there
7228000	7230000	An actual video game and not just a porno
7230000	7232000	It kind of reminds me of
7232000	7234000	30 Rock
7234000	7236000	Season 3 when Tracy Jordan was
7236000	7238000	Gonna quit television to make the most
7238000	7240000	Amazing porn computer game of all time
7240000	7242000	I don't know if anyone watches 30 Rock
7242000	7244000	Maybe this is it
7244000	7246000	We should get the creators of this on the show
7246000	7248000	Like let's totally take them seriously
7248000	7250000	And just be like you know so tell us about
7250000	7252000	The plot of your game like how do you
7252000	7254000	Envision your hero
7256000	7258000	Come on you know you want it
7258000	7260000	Episode 400 interview with Bonecraft
7260000	7262000	Yes or no? What do you think?
7262000	7264000	I think we should
7264000	7266000	That's gonna be the drunk show
7266000	7268000	What would you ask the creators of Bonecraft
7268000	7270000	Logie? I don't know
7270000	7272000	I'd have to learn more about their
7272000	7274000	Title I guess
7274000	7276000	Well the title is Bonecraft
7276000	7278000	I understand that but what the hell's
7278000	7280000	The game I mean
7280000	7282000	Bone town is just some really crappy
7282000	7284000	Avatar game where people talk dirty to
7284000	7286000	Each other I mean that's
7286000	7288000	It doesn't tell me anything
7288000	7290000	Alright let's get to some
7290000	7292000	More stories and then the mailbag
7292000	7294000	And the FUs of the week are all coming right up
7294000	7296000	I mean seriously
7296000	7298000	What is Bonecraft?
7298000	7300000	What is it?
7300000	7302000	Um
7302000	7304000	Alright so you know
7304000	7306000	PSP2
7306000	7308000	Let's not talk about it because you know
7308000	7310000	No one's announced it yet but it might
7310000	7312000	Be announced very soon actually there is
7312000	7314000	A rumor that the PSP2 will be unveiled
7314000	7316000	This month in Tokyo at a Sony
7316000	7318000	Business meeting and it has been confirmed
7318000	7320000	That such a meeting is being held
7320000	7322000	In Tokyo on January 27
7322000	7324000	This was confirmed by
7324000	7326000	Sony themselves of course they say
7326000	7328000	They can't comment on anything at this time
7328000	7330000	Which probably means that yes
7330000	7332000	They are going to be announcing it at that time
7332000	7334000	Um
7334000	7336000	So that's cool so if they announce it this year
7336000	7338000	I'm assuming it will probably be coming out this year
7338000	7340000	It'll probably be at E3 so
7340000	7342000	Um I guess we'll have to wait and see
7342000	7344000	When that
7344000	7346000	PSP2 is coming out
7346000	7348000	That doesn't exist but does exist
7348000	7350000	Yeah
7350000	7352000	By the way it
7352000	7354000	Missed our show roll tonight
7354000	7356000	But E3 I guess is now open
7356000	7358000	Taking registrations and all that fun stuff
7358000	7360000	I know because we've been kind of looking into it trying to make our plan
7360000	7362000	For E3 this year which sadly we
7362000	7364000	Already know Loki's not going based on things he said
7364000	7366000	On the show before but uh
7366000	7368000	I am doing everything I can in my power to go
7368000	7370000	This year because you know I think I've said this before
7370000	7372000	On the show this year is going to be either
7372000	7374000	The best E3 ever or the worst
7374000	7376000	E3 ever I honestly
7376000	7378000	Think because it's going to be all about
7378000	7380000	You know where they're going to go
7380000	7382000	With these new fangled things
7382000	7384000	They've got on consoles
7384000	7386000	What's next? Where's your killer app?
7386000	7388000	I really don't think anyone's going to be announcing
7388000	7390000	A new console this year
7390000	7392000	I don't think the
7392000	7394000	Wii HD is happening at a Nintendo at this point
7394000	7396000	Because I think they're going to really throw everything
7396000	7398000	They've gotten to the 3DS this year
7398000	7400000	It's everything you're going to be seeing
7400000	7402000	Sony and Microsoft
7402000	7404000	Have no reason to give up what they're doing on their
7404000	7406000	Consoles right now so
7406000	7408000	Well I guess the PSP2
7408000	7410000	Would be the one console that you're probably going to see
7410000	7412000	More information about
7412000	7414000	That wasn't announced earlier
7414000	7416000	As we've heard it might actually come out with Tokyo Game
7416000	7418000	Developers Conference who knows
7418000	7420000	Could come out a lot sooner
7420000	7422000	It's going to be a very interesting year
7422000	7424000	I hopped on this generation of consoles pretty late
7424000	7426000	I didn't get a 360
7426000	7428000	Which is the first out of the two that I got
7428000	7430000	Until Christmas of 08
7430000	7432000	So a little over two years
7432000	7434000	The idea that the 360 is
7434000	7436000	Six years old or will be this summer
7436000	7438000	I know
7438000	7440000	I can't wrap my head around that
7440000	7442000	When the new consoles should be
7442000	7444000	They should be announcing a new Xbox this year
7444000	7446000	But it's not time
7446000	7448000	I don't think it's time
7448000	7450000	We've got at least one or two more years out of these things
7450000	7452000	Isn't it funny that when we were sitting here
7452000	7454000	Because the show has been on this long
7454000	7456000	That we have episodes dating back to when these
7456000	7458000	Consoles were debuting and we were sitting here going
7458000	7460000	They're saying that PS3 has a 10 year life cycle
7460000	7462000	Come on you're not
7462000	7464000	You're full of crap
7464000	7466000	I'm not ready to see new hardware yet
7466000	7468000	I'm not either
7468000	7470000	I'm going to be off if new hardware were out already
7470000	7472000	Because it would be all 3D and you need 3D
7472000	7474000	TVs for it and
7474000	7476000	Everything
7476000	7478000	I don't know
7478000	7480000	You already made me buy upgrades to the current consoles
7480000	7482000	With the Kinect and the Move
7482000	7484000	Although I didn't buy the Move
7484000	7486000	Give me reasons to really love these things
7486000	7488000	If there's a game to necessitate it
7488000	7490000	There wasn't a game that necessitated me buying it
7490000	7492000	I would even argue that maybe
7492000	7494000	I shouldn't have bought the Kinect
7494000	7496000	But I do really like Dance Central and some of the other stuff
7496000	7498000	But I really don't have a reason to get a move right now
7498000	7500000	So I don't know
7500000	7502000	There's a lot of people out there saying
7502000	7504000	Dark ToaGak in our chatroom says I still don't have a 360
7504000	7508000	Are people still calling it next gen consoles?
7508000	7510000	Because I think we're past that right?
7510000	7512000	I made that mistake for about two years after it was out
7512000	7514000	Next gen
7514000	7516000	Next gen
7516000	7518000	There is no next gen yet
7518000	7520000	We'll see
7520000	7522000	One person that wants to play a little more
7522000	7524000	In what's going on in the console world
7524000	7526000	It's GameStop
7526000	7528000	They want to link you with a GameStop ID
7528000	7530000	On their console
7530000	7532000	That's because GameStop is selling more of the digital stuff
7532000	7534000	In their stores
7534000	7536000	They had an interview with Ars Technica
7536000	7538000	Not that long ago
7538000	7540000	And the Senior Vice President of GameStop, Sean Freeman
7540000	7542000	Said that while the company is doing a good job
7542000	7544000	Of selling Microsoft Points cards
7544000	7546000	They're looking to cut some of the friction
7546000	7548000	Out of the experience
7548000	7550000	I'm not sure what that means
7550000	7552000	But what they say is that instead of buying a card
7552000	7554000	To go home and input the code
7554000	7556000	Ultimately they want you to tie your online account
7556000	7558000	With a GameStop ID
7558000	7560000	So ultimately we want to reduce
7560000	7562000	Even more of that friction
7562000	7564000	So when you buy that map pack in our store
7564000	7566000	We're going to be able to associate your Xbox profile
7566000	7568000	With your GameStop profile
7568000	7570000	And then automatically push it to your download queue
7570000	7572000	I still never understood
7572000	7574000	The reason why I would want to even do this
7574000	7576000	Honestly
7576000	7578000	I mean
7578000	7580000	If you're going to
7580000	7582000	Say for example
7582000	7584000	Buy download content from them
7584000	7586000	Just buy a fucking 1600 point card
7586000	7588000	Or something like that
7588000	7590000	Why are you going to give them your information for this stuff
7590000	7592000	Why do you even
7592000	7594000	Even if you're not interested in purchasing a ton of download content
7594000	7596000	And you have no games to trade in
7596000	7598000	Why the fuck would you ever
7598000	7600000	Leave your home
7600000	7602000	Go to a store
7602000	7604000	To buy something that you could just flip your console on
7604000	7606000	And download straight from the marketplace
7606000	7608000	And download straight to your console
7608000	7610000	And I tell you
7610000	7612000	By the time you drove to the store and back
7612000	7614000	It would already be downloaded
7614000	7616000	So I just don't understand
7616000	7618000	Why you would even like
7618000	7620000	Waste the time to go give them money
7620000	7622000	And you're paying tax
7622000	7624000	On top of that
7624000	7626000	I'm making stink face at this whole idea
7626000	7628000	To have a separate layer of
7628000	7630000	A GameStop ID
7630000	7632000	That's just yet another account that I have to sync
7632000	7634000	With my XBLA or whatever
7634000	7636000	If they want to be the middle man in that
7636000	7638000	Password that could possibly get exploited
7638000	7640000	Yeah this is a dumb
7640000	7642000	Idea and I don't get it
7642000	7644000	Well I think GameStop to some extent is doing what they feel
7644000	7646000	They have to do to survive
7646000	7648000	Because I think we've said this on the show before
7648000	7650000	That GameStop is going to go the way of Blockbuster Video
7650000	7652000	Real soon
7652000	7654000	If something doesn't happen
7654000	7656000	Here's the thing, they're not going anywhere
7656000	7658000	Because they're the biggest fish in the sea
7658000	7660000	So was Blockbuster at one time
7660000	7662000	No no no no
7662000	7664000	This is totally different because you see
7664000	7666000	The publisher or the movie studios
7666000	7668000	They don't need Blockbuster
7668000	7670000	Like they need GameStop
7670000	7672000	Because Blockbuster rents
7672000	7674000	Movies, they don't sell movies
7674000	7676000	And unfortunately they make more money
7676000	7678000	In the sell through business than they do in the rental business
7678000	7680000	If Blockbuster was a big powerhouse
7680000	7682000	In selling movies that would be a different
7682000	7684000	Different thing altogether
7684000	7686000	But GameStop, they're a big powerhouse
7686000	7688000	When it comes to sell through and unfortunately
7688000	7690000	They could dictate
7690000	7692000	To the publishers what the fuck do they want
7692000	7694000	Them to do
7694000	7696000	So they say, you know what, we still want you to put physical copies out
7696000	7698000	They're going to put physical copies out
7698000	7700000	They're just trying to get into the DLC
7700000	7702000	Stuff because they figure, hey, we can get some
7702000	7704000	More money from that because we can just
7704000	7706000	Pay Microsoft or whatever
7706000	7708000	Or a small little kickback for these things
7708000	7710000	But we get some money out of that transaction
7710000	7712000	And that's more money for us
7712000	7714000	Because we don't actually have to sell any physical goods
7714000	7716000	It's digital stuff now
7716000	7718000	So that's what that's all about
7718000	7720000	I mean if they really wanted to
7720000	7722000	I mean they have cards and stuff
7722000	7724000	That I guess they have made for them
7724000	7726000	But that's all it's about
7726000	7728000	It's not about them trying to survive
7728000	7730000	It's about them being fucking greedy
7730000	7732000	That's all it is
7732000	7734000	They don't need to be in this business at all
7734000	7736000	Why aren't they selling
7736000	7738000	Well I guess I should say
7738000	7740000	Why aren't they selling PC games digitally
7740000	7742000	But they are
7742000	7744000	But I mean they're in no way going to be able to
7744000	7746000	Compete well with Steam or something
7746000	7748000	It's just
7748000	7750000	We're looking at our comments from chatroom at chat.orangelandtrady.com
7750000	7752000	Brad from Pod Culture says
7752000	7754000	Used to work at Blockbuster back in the day
7754000	7756000	And yes Blockbuster does sell movies
7756000	7758000	New and used
7758000	7760000	I know that they do but they're not like at Walmart
7760000	7762000	Where Walmart sells hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
7762000	7764000	And hundreds and hundreds and thousands of movies
7764000	7766000	Versus Blockbuster's
7766000	7768000	Oh we're bringing in some extra for sell through
7768000	7770000	It's way different
7770000	7772000	Way different
7772000	7774000	They never looked at Blockbuster as a big old
7774000	7776000	Source of
7776000	7778000	Profit for stuff
7778000	7780000	Unfortunately things change
7780000	7782000	Way back in the day one
7782000	7784000	It was all about VHS tapes
7784000	7786000	And stuff like that
7786000	7788000	And they were charging the Blockbuster's
7788000	7790000	Or any video rental place
7790000	7792000	Up to $100 per tape
7792000	7794000	That's where they're making the money
7794000	7796000	But then with the advent of DVD
7796000	7798000	Unfortunately the cost of goods has come down
7798000	7800000	It's all about quantity
7800000	7802000	And so because of quantity
7802000	7804000	Their business has shifted to sell through
7804000	7806000	Where a $100 movie was
7806000	7808000	Way out of the realm of
7808000	7810000	Some consumer purchasing it for themselves
7810000	7812000	So that's why they had to rent it out
7812000	7814000	Before it became sell through pricing
7814000	7816000	Now everything is released at sell through
7816000	7818000	Pricing and so there's really
7818000	7820000	No incentive for somebody to
7820000	7822000	Well I mean there is an incentive for people to rent
7822000	7824000	Stuff because it's still cheaper but
7824000	7826000	It's less of an incentive now because they can just
7826000	7828000	Go to the store and buy their movie
7828000	7830000	New
7830000	7832000	Because before they wouldn't be able to do that
7832000	7834000	So that's why it's all shifted to
7834000	7836000	The sell through business and that's why
7836000	7838000	Blockbuster is
7838000	7840000	Well it's why Blockbuster is failing
7840000	7842000	That and they're losing out to
7842000	7844000	Kiosk vendors and stuff like that
7844000	7846000	Kind of a funny comment from our chatroom
7846000	7848000	At chat.orangelandtrader.com
7848000	7850000	Rama says no GameStop lost their touch when they got rid of the
7850000	7852000	Funkoland name
7852000	7854000	I remember when Funkoland advertised
7854000	7856000	In magazines and stuff and you could get their little
7856000	7858000	Flyer it was all like a mail order thing
7858000	7860000	It was the good old days
7860000	7862000	Alright we're going to get into the mail bag here at
7862000	7864000	Orangelandtrader.com slash mail bag
7864000	7866000	But just getting into the studio right now
7866000	7868000	Dark Sakura has arrived
7868000	7870000	Back from her event. Welcome back
7870000	7872000	You've been missed tonight. How are you doing?
7872000	7874000	I'm pinballed out
7874000	7876000	I played nothing but Rocky and Bullinkle and I
7876000	7878000	Played Theater of Magic before we actually got there
7878000	7880000	Alright and I apologize in advance
7880000	7882000	I have to do some audio adjusting
7882000	7884000	On the fly because Dark Sakura and Salacious Pop are not
7884000	7886000	The same. Salacious Pop was using
7886000	7888000	Dark Sakura's microphone so
7888000	7890000	Not the same. Yes you have boobies
7890000	7892000	Yes and they are magnificent
7892000	7894000	Well how was the pinball event? You want to tell us real quick
7894000	7896000	About it? I know it was a private thing so it wasn't
7896000	7898000	Like a public event but
7898000	7900000	It was pretty cool. He had a lot of good tables
7900000	7902000	And there was like 25 people over
7902000	7904000	There and Steve Ritchie was there
7904000	7906000	And he was really cool
7906000	7908000	I mentioned earlier in the show you were texting me this morning
7908000	7910000	That you were rubbing elbows with some famous
7910000	7912000	Pinball peeps. That's pretty cool
7912000	7914000	Did you give us an interview for the show?
7914000	7916000	No but his wife and I talked for a long time
7916000	7918000	And she's really sweet. Oh good
7918000	7920000	Yeah um
7920000	7922000	Yeah Dan's in there saying we probably could
7922000	7924000	He's really cool. I mean I've just
7924000	7926000	Sat and chatted with him before at
7926000	7928000	Convention so. Sure. What tables did he work on?
7928000	7930000	Um he did
7930000	7932000	No Fear and
7932000	7934000	Black Knight which are both ones that we have
7934000	7936000	And he did the voices in them. Oh right because you're
7936000	7938000	Very proud of your autograph on those right?
7938000	7940000	Dan just come in here and answer the damn questions
7940000	7942000	Dan just been driving for two hours
7942000	7944000	You was away. You were like in the Bay Area right?
7944000	7946000	Um actually somewhere
7946000	7948000	Near French Camp
7948000	7950000	Oh that's not down by Stockton. Okay
7950000	7952000	Yeah just past Stockton. Oh you're going the other way
7952000	7954000	But we rode with someone in Davis
7954000	7956000	So that's why
7956000	7958000	We gave the update from Davis
7958000	7960000	Sure sure gotcha
7960000	7962000	But I played a lot of Rocky and Bull Eagle
7962000	7964000	And there was a whirlwind
7964000	7966000	And uh
7966000	7968000	Safe Cracker I think was one of them
7968000	7970000	And uh they have
7970000	7972000	Really really pretty Twilight Zone
7972000	7974000	Like with the topper and everything
7974000	7976000	And uh
7976000	7978000	All kinds of good stuff
7978000	7980000	Rob would you like a chair?
7980000	7982000	And uh
7982000	7984000	Yeah sorry for the dead air
7984000	7986000	I'm getting hammered with chat and chairs
7986000	7988000	Switcheroo and all that at once. Live radio folks
7988000	7990000	He hit him with the metal chair!
7990000	7992000	Boom! No
7992000	7994000	Um but it was
7994000	7996000	It was pretty fun and then my
7996000	7998000	Hips started to hurt and I started to get grumpy
7998000	8000000	So I sat down and got on my
8000000	8002000	Laptop for a little bit and you know
8002000	8004000	I had a lot of beer
8004000	8006000	Good times. So you've been drinking a little bit
8006000	8008000	Three New Castles and a Guinness. That's not a lot
8008000	8010000	That's nothing for you. You should have seen me last night
8010000	8012000	I mentioned this earlier on the show. I was out with
8012000	8014000	Rice Princess and X-tifer and Grandpa
8014000	8016000	Warcraft from the other show and
8016000	8018000	Salacious Pop here. We were all out and I
8018000	8020000	Got drunk. Like I made a
8020000	8022000	Ass of myself in front of Rice Princess and X-tifer
8024000	8026000	I know I actually will. Oh sorry you were
8026000	8028000	Muted there Salacious Pop. I'm sorry
8028000	8030000	I was drunk that he agreed to go to Denny's
8030000	8032000	For the after bar food
8032000	8034000	I hate Denny's with a passion
8034000	8036000	Like I just burned out on Denny's in my
8036000	8038000	Early 20's right
8038000	8040000	That was the post club place to go
8040000	8042000	Well keep in mind for the rest of you guys that aren't in California
8042000	8044000	We don't really have diners here
8044000	8046000	Like diners are unheard of here. There is no such thing
8046000	8048000	As a waffle house. Which is a shame
8048000	8050000	No mom and pa diners. There's nothing like that
8050000	8052000	We have Denny's. Denny's, Denny's, Denny's, Denny's
8052000	8054000	Everywhere. Well we had Lion's and we had Epi's
8054000	8056000	None of them are 24 hours anymore
8056000	8058000	And they're gone
8058000	8060000	It's Denny's and last night when I was drunk
8060000	8062000	I wanted chicken strips
8062000	8064000	They sobered him right up
8064000	8066000	Greasy chicken strips. They're good. Hang over here
8066000	8068000	Well you remember my last super drunk time
8068000	8070000	That I was hanging out with you other than the time
8070000	8072000	At Tia's when they lit up in the apartment
8072000	8074000	And it made me throw up
8074000	8076000	Was the waffles
8076000	8078000	The waffle incident
8080000	8082000	It's carby stuff Rob
8082000	8084000	It's the greasy carby stuff
8084000	8086000	Well I guess I should pull up the chatroom
8086000	8088000	You'd be very proud of
8088000	8090000	We've gotten through most of your news tonight already
8090000	8092000	You'd be very proud of Salacious Pop. He did a fine job
8092000	8094000	He picked the classic game of the week tonight
8094000	8096000	What was it?
8096000	8098000	King's Quest IV
8098000	8100000	Of course the Rosella game
8100000	8102000	Which was one of the best in the series
8102000	8104000	Figured since you tended to give
8104000	8106000	Sega a lot of love
8106000	8108000	Because Sega deserves my love
8108000	8110000	Salacious Pop went to the PC market
8110000	8112000	We did determine today
8112000	8114000	On the ride back that Sega makes
8114000	8116000	Crappy pinball tables
8116000	8118000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag you guys
8118000	8120000	At mailbag
8120000	8122000	At orangeloungeradio.com
8122000	8124000	And sadly there is not a lot in the
8124000	8126000	Mailbag tonight
8126000	8128000	Where's my mailbag music?
8128000	8130000	Is there Viagra spam? Because you can just read that
8130000	8132000	Not this week
8132000	8134000	I'll go ahead and do it since Dark Soccer is still getting
8134000	8136000	Do you want to be uncomfortably hard?
8136000	8138000	Well also
8138000	8140000	A lot of it's my fault with the whole lack
8140000	8142000	Of podcast feed updating
8142000	8144000	But again a new show went up today
8144000	8146000	And will continue throughout the three day weekend
8146000	8148000	I have tomorrow off so I'm going to work on OLR stuff
8148000	8150000	Before I forget, 71
8150000	8152000	Is what?
8152000	8154000	Since we were keeping track of my levels
8154000	8156000	Oh god
8156000	8158000	I already told you last night
8158000	8160000	Alright, anyhow
8160000	8162000	Let's get into this email from
8162000	8164000	RobWithTwoB's
8164000	8166000	And this is actually somewhat of a serious email
8166000	8168000	Because obviously we had that tragedy that happened in Arizona
8168000	8170000	Which is just
8170000	8172000	Unfortunately some bonehead
8172000	8174000	Did something really really really
8174000	8176000	Really really bad
8176000	8178000	And now it's making a lot of people think
8178000	8180000	Differently and in response
8180000	8182000	Let me read the email here
8182000	8184000	From Rob
8184000	8186000	In response to Jared Lee Lauder gun attack
8186000	8188000	It appears the following article replaces video games
8188000	8190000	With political rhetoric
8190000	8192000	The article is good even though the study mentioned is weak
8192000	8194000	And he links us to the story from Boing Boing
8194000	8196000	The bottom line is that you have to be
8196000	8198000	A violent person to begin with
8198000	8200000	Let me kind of go to the story real quick
8200000	8202000	And try to pick out some of this stuff
8202000	8204000	Oh yeah
8204000	8206000	They just kind of go through
8206000	8208000	This study and they just replace
8208000	8210000	The words video games with violent rhetoric
8210000	8212000	And it's kind of like, gee haven't we seen this whole thing before?
8212000	8214000	IDK
8214000	8216000	But Rob
8216000	8218000	Says my point of view and I know I've said this before in a mail bag letter
8218000	8220000	Is that a person is solely responsible
8220000	8222000	For what influences him or her
8222000	8224000	Although from what I've read of the Arizona shooting
8224000	8226000	The shooter was extremely mentally ill
8226000	8228000	And without treatment
8228000	8230000	We may be looking at a situation where the parents
8230000	8232000	Did not know about paranoid schizophrenia
8232000	8234000	And therefore didn't get treatment for him
8234000	8236000	Don't worry though, video games are also being blamed
8236000	8238000	Of course, aren't they always?
8238000	8240000	From all with two B's
8240000	8242000	And it's just unfortunate, you know, in these times of tragedy
8242000	8244000	Everybody's, you know, kind of pointing the finger
8244000	8246000	At what there is to blame
8246000	8248000	And I don't know
8248000	8250000	All of it's to blame to an extent
8250000	8252000	But what's most to blame
8252000	8254000	Is this individual
8254000	8256000	An individual is responsible for their actions
8256000	8258000	And it's, I don't know
8258000	8260000	It's just, it's a
8260000	8262000	Not an easy situation with not an easy answer to it
8262000	8264000	But, you know, you have to look to how to
8264000	8266000	Prevent this type of stuff in the future
8266000	8268000	And we're all gonna pay for it
8268000	8270000	Because, you know, it's not gonna be, it's gonna
8270000	8272000	Make our Congress people less accessible
8272000	8274000	In the future
8274000	8276000	It's just unfortunate
8276000	8278000	And yeah, I kind of agree with Frisbee in our chat room
8278000	8280000	This guy is a psycho, end of line
8280000	8282000	Yeah, that's, that's kind of how I
8282000	8284000	Feel about it
8284000	8286000	There you go, that's it for the emails this week
8286000	8288000	Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com
8288000	8290000	I'm expecting this thing to be full next week
8290000	8292000	Full with stories next week
8292000	8294000	Loki has another news story
8294000	8296000	For us, and then we're gonna get to the Skype line
8296000	8298000	Here in just a minute at Orangelaunchradio on
8298000	8300000	Skype or our phone number
8300000	8302000	1-877-GAME-OLR
8302000	8304000	Yes, last thing I have to talk
8304000	8306000	About, and this is not a surprise
8306000	8308000	I mean, I guess this is a surprise for a Wii game
8308000	8310000	Just Dance 2 has gone
8310000	8312000	Five times platinum, that's right
8312000	8314000	It sold five million copies
8314000	8316000	And that's not bad
8316000	8318000	For considering the fact it came out
8318000	8320000	At the end of October
8320000	8322000	That's way too much Kesha, for me
8322000	8324000	That's way too much
8324000	8326000	That's insane though, that it's done that well
8326000	8328000	I mean, yeah, to put this
8328000	8330000	In contrast, we just had a story earlier in the show
8330000	8332000	Where you were saying, hey, Dance Central's doing great
8332000	8334000	It sold one million copies
8334000	8336000	We just mentioned now
8336000	8338000	Just Dance has sold
8338000	8340000	Just Dance 2, excuse me, has sold five
8340000	8342000	Million copies
8342000	8344000	It's not like Just Dance franchise has sold five million copies
8344000	8346000	This one game has sold five million copies
8346000	8348000	That is crazy
8348000	8350000	It is so popular
8350000	8352000	I'm surprised
8352000	8354000	That Ubisoft hasn't brought
8354000	8356000	The Just Dance franchise
8356000	8358000	To other consoles now
8358000	8360000	They have the Move and the Kinect stuff
8360000	8362000	Well, the Michael Jackson game
8362000	8364000	Isn't that really just a Just Dance Michael Jackson game?
8364000	8366000	It's coming out on the other systems
8366000	8368000	I bet you though that we'll see Just Dance 3 come out on all the platforms
8368000	8370000	Oh, I'm sure
8370000	8372000	The Move would be
8372000	8374000	Stupid easy to port
8374000	8376000	Because it's very similar
8376000	8378000	Kinect, a little different
8378000	8380000	And it's going to be hard to separate it now
8380000	8382000	Like Dance Central kind of beat them to the punch a little bit on Kinect
8382000	8384000	But if Dance Central
8384000	8386000	And Dance Masters can kind of coexist
8386000	8388000	And Dance Paradise
8388000	8390000	Oh yeah, that one
8390000	8392000	That's not out here, is it?
8392000	8394000	Okay, then I guess there'll be room for this too
8394000	8396000	But you know what?
8396000	8398000	Then I think I've had enough dancing games
8398000	8400000	They need to kill each other off in a battle royale
8400000	8402000	And one will be left standing
8402000	8404000	Which will probably be Dance Central
8404000	8406000	Get some Highlander up in this
8406000	8408000	For real, I want to see the head chopped off of Dance Masters
8408000	8412000	There can be only one
8412000	8414000	And make it be really good and I will buy that one
8414000	8420000	Evacuate the dance floor
8420000	8422000	Alright, forget it
8422000	8424000	Moving on to one more song here
8424000	8426000	One more story here
8426000	8428000	Maybe it'll have a song and dance with it
8428000	8430000	Cooking Mama has arrived on Facebook
8430000	8432000	That's right
8432000	8434000	Mama will fix Facebook now
8434000	8436000	The Cooking Mama franchise has arrived on Facebook this week
8436000	8438000	Friends Cafe
8438000	8440000	Is the name of the game
8440000	8442000	So we're going to dub it then Clicky Mama, right?
8442000	8444000	Yes, Clicky Mama
8444000	8446000	That's right, Clicky Mama
8446000	8448000	Don't worry, Mama will click it
8448000	8450000	You can visit the game at facebook.com slash
8450000	8452000	Cooking Mama Cafe
8452000	8454000	It has some of the same food preparation
8454000	8456000	Gameplay, of course
8456000	8458000	That you're used to seeing in the series
8458000	8460000	There's also unlockable upgrades
8460000	8462000	For your personal kitchen
8462000	8464000	Of course, you can buy them as well
8464000	8466000	Cause it's a Facebook game
8466000	8468000	And if you neglect your cafe, you will see it shut down
8468000	8470000	Aww
8470000	8472000	So there you go
8472000	8474000	If you want to see what's going on in the Cooking Mama world
8474000	8476000	You can now explore that on Facebook
8476000	8478000	I wonder how many people will abandon Knights of the Crystals
8478000	8480000	To go play Friends Cafe
8480000	8482000	I don't know
8482000	8484000	Oh god
8484000	8486000	83, I'm level 83 in that game
8486000	8488000	And I think Slice is Pop is actually higher than me
8488000	8490000	Yeah, I've run out of stuff to do, really
8490000	8492000	In Knights of the Clicky
8492000	8494000	Knights of the Clicky is not even a good game
8494000	8496000	I've already given up on it
8496000	8498000	Why do I keep playing it?
8498000	8500000	Rob wants help!
8500000	8502000	Yay, thank you, I appreciate it
8502000	8504000	They have released new stages
8504000	8506000	Like I just unlocked the Merman
8506000	8508000	From doing the underwater stages
8508000	8510000	So that's about all they do
8510000	8512000	But for every new map that they open up
8512000	8514000	They also release one that only requires pay items
8514000	8516000	Of course
8516000	8518000	That's how it works
8518000	8520000	You know what? It's all going to shit when the Civilization game comes out
8520000	8522000	That's how I feel
8522000	8524000	I want that damn Civilization game now
8524000	8526000	That's when you'll dust off your credit card for a Facebook title
8526000	8528000	For real
8528000	8530000	Alright, we're going to open up the Skypline
8530000	8532000	It is open right now
8532000	8534000	We're going to do the Effies of the Week
8534000	8536000	We didn't do the Effies of the Week yet
8536000	8538000	I'm bad
8538000	8540000	I did a bad thing and we didn't get the angst out
8540000	8542000	Oh Rob, you're so bad
8542000	8544000	I was just distracted by you getting back to the studio
8544000	8546000	My DJ's so bad?
8556000	8558000	Uh, F you to my hip
8558000	8560000	Fucker
8560000	8562000	Done
8562000	8564000	Slaces pop
8564000	8566000	Um, F you I guess
8566000	8568000	To me not really knowing how awesome Panera Bread is
8568000	8570000	Up until just recently
8570000	8572000	It's a pretty good month so far
8572000	8574000	No angst
8574000	8576000	Um
8576000	8578000	F you to the fact that I have a very tough decision coming up
8578000	8580000	And I think I know what I'm going to do
8580000	8582000	And it's not going to make some people very happy with me
8582000	8584000	But in the end I know that it's the thing I've got to do
8584000	8586000	It has nothing to do with me
8586000	8588000	It has nothing to do with this program or anything you guys know about me
8588000	8590000	So it's just
8590000	8592000	I'm being cryptical on purpose
8592000	8594000	But I don't like these tough decisions
8594000	8596000	I think I know what it is
8596000	8598000	Oh you do, I know you do
8598000	8600000	But sorry listeners, it's private
8600000	8602000	Loki
8602000	8604000	Uh, F you to my JTAC constantly being broken
8604000	8606000	And it was really broken
8606000	8608000	I actually sent it away to be re-balled
8608000	8610000	Which is where they pull the chips off
8610000	8612000	And they put new solder balls on them
8612000	8614000	They actually have lead in them
8614000	8616000	How they should have been
8616000	8618000	And that didn't even fix it
8618000	8620000	So uh
8620000	8622000	It's broke
8622000	8624000	Alright
8624000	8626000	That's going to do it for the FUs of the week
8626000	8628000	Let's go to the Skype line but we're going to start the Skype line tonight
8628000	8630000	With something a little special
8630000	8632000	We're actually going to place a call right now
8632000	8634000	And uh
8634000	8636000	Get him on the line here
8636000	8638000	So we can get an update on what's going on
8638000	8640000	With one of our partner shows
8640000	8642000	Hi Breslil are you there?
8642000	8644000	What? Huh? Breslil how you doing?
8644000	8646000	Hi Hi
8646000	8648000	Hi Hi
8648000	8650000	Guy? Hi
8650000	8652000	What? What? Oh shit
8652000	8654000	Alright Breslil is helping out with a big old
8654000	8656000	To do thing at Under Sedation Live
8656000	8658000	They're our pals and buddies and I say that mostly
8658000	8660000	Because that's the show I started on
8660000	8662000	And they are live of course Saturday nights here
8662000	8664000	At All Games Radio and uh
8664000	8666000	We like to help out with a little thing called
8666000	8668000	USLOLR Madness
8668000	8670000	Yeah and it's
8670000	8672000	I have learned something I am not expanding it
8672000	8674000	To 96 games next year
8674000	8676000	There's a lot of shit that gets in there honestly
8676000	8678000	I voted on the
8678000	8680000	Current brackets and there's some weird shit in there
8680000	8682000	Yeah it's because people
8682000	8684000	People like SSJ-100
8684000	8686000	Matt say hey Blade's a steal number one
8686000	8688000	And then it gets a 12 seed
8688000	8690000	So anyways
8690000	8692000	Voting for the Breslil region
8692000	8694000	Actually closes in about half an hour
8694000	8696000	For the first region it will close
8696000	8698000	And then I'll announce the
8698000	8700000	Next line of games when we get into the real meat
8700000	8702000	And potatoes basically Chrono Trigger comes
8702000	8704000	To play that's all that happens
8704000	8706000	But I have some scores here of some games
8706000	8708000	I thought you all would be interested in
8708000	8710000	Alrighty
8710000	8712000	So I'll start with the OLR region because it's your
8712000	8714000	Region
8714000	8716000	Secret of Mana
8716000	8718000	Is beating Katamari
8718000	8720000	Namashe right now
8720000	8722000	It's pretty close. Quake is losing
8722000	8724000	To Half Life
8724000	8726000	I'm okay with both of those
8726000	8728000	Sometimes and the weird thing about
8728000	8730000	USL Madness is that sometimes the pairings
8730000	8732000	Are really hard early on
8732000	8734000	And you know that's true of any tournament
8734000	8736000	Comp style competition but sometimes the pairings
8736000	8738000	This early on like Quake vs
8738000	8740000	Half Life those are both games that deserve
8740000	8742000	To move on but just the way the brackets are set up
8742000	8744000	It's not gonna happen you know
8744000	8746000	And um
8746000	8748000	What else was I gonna say about that you know
8748000	8750000	It's like Mega Man 2 vs Mega Man 3 last year
8750000	8752000	That was just probably one of the toughest decisions
8752000	8754000	I had to make
8754000	8756000	At that point you know there really only
8756000	8758000	Needed to be one Mega Man game that represents
8758000	8760000	Them all you know
8760000	8762000	Yeah but moving on the last one
8762000	8764000	And this is a Bemani one so I had to throw it in there
8764000	8766000	Para Para Paradise is
8766000	8768000	Narrowly losing to Sinistar right now
8768000	8770000	That is such a weird
8770000	8772000	Match up
8772000	8774000	Yeah I don't know how that works
8774000	8776000	You know what though as much as I love my
8776000	8778000	Dancy games I don't think Para Para
8778000	8780000	Is the dancy game I would choose to represent
8780000	8782000	Sorry Misty I know you're gonna hate me for that
8782000	8784000	But Sinistar did bring us the whole
8784000	8786000	Beware I live
8788000	8790000	Which is pretty awesome
8790000	8792000	Moving on to the Harper region
8792000	8794000	Wow is barely beating Bionic Commando
8794000	8796000	It's by like a vote
8796000	8798000	Wow
8798000	8800000	Yeah exactly
8800000	8802000	Pong is beating System Shock
8802000	8804000	And probably the most bizarre first round
8804000	8806000	Match up and it's beating it pretty soundly
8806000	8808000	Here's a head scratcher
8808000	8810000	Kingdom Hearts is beating
8810000	8812000	Markham Asylum
8812000	8814000	Interesting
8814000	8816000	Well I
8816000	8818000	Knowing the listeners of this show
8818000	8820000	That mostly prefer the import
8820000	8822000	Stuff I mean if I were to say you know the majority
8822000	8824000	Of the listeners not all of them but I know the majority
8824000	8826000	Of our folks are kind of into the
8826000	8828000	Squeenix import stuff that doesn't
8828000	8830000	Surprise me
8830000	8832000	I can't speak for USL but I know we have
8832000	8834000	A lot of the same listeners so it wouldn't surprise me
8834000	8836000	I got sick of Kingdom Hearts
8836000	8838000	Pretty quickly but that's just me
8838000	8840000	Over to the Donovan region and the other
8840000	8842000	Bmoni game in this region
8842000	8844000	If you're wondering where the hell DDR is
8844000	8846000	DDR got a 3 seed so it gets a buy
8846000	8848000	In the first round it doesn't get to play
8848000	8850000	But Popin' Music
8850000	8852000	Is playing Perfect Dark and
8852000	8854000	It's not looking good for Popin' Music
8854000	8856000	As it
8856000	8858000	As it doesn't need to be
8858000	8860000	Looking good for it
8860000	8862000	And speaking of Blades of Steel it's losing
8862000	8864000	To Dragon Quest 9 right now pretty badly
8864000	8866000	Ouch
8866000	8868000	This is one of the Brestler region I'm also not saying
8868000	8870000	All of these games because it would be 32
8870000	8872000	Matchups we'd be here forever and Rob, Jamie
8872000	8874000	And Loki have things to do tonight
8874000	8876000	Where can you kind of like
8876000	8878000	Follow the action on what's going on
8878000	8880000	At USL Madness
8880000	8882000	I haven't been posting the
8882000	8884000	Results but
8884000	8886000	Time and again I will every day post
8886000	8888000	Like oh hey this matchup's close
8888000	8890000	Or this region needs votes like the OLR
8890000	8892000	Region really needs votes right now so
8892000	8894000	And then I'm gonna
8894000	8896000	Finally go to the Brestler region here
8896000	8898000	Final Fantasy 10
8898000	8900000	Is just barely beating
8900000	8902000	Crazy Taxi
8902000	8904000	Borderlands
8904000	8906000	Is beating the ever loving snot out of the
8906000	8908000	Call of Duty series
8908000	8910000	Good
8910000	8912000	Yeah that one was like
8912000	8914000	That could go either way but I wouldn't be
8914000	8916000	Upset if Borderlands went and then here's
8916000	8918000	Probably the most interesting one, Techno Super
8918000	8920000	Bowl is losing to Halo Reach
8920000	8922000	By about 10%
8922000	8924000	No that's not
8924000	8926000	That is not even the Halo game that should be
8926000	8928000	Representing the Halo franchise I'm sorry
8928000	8930000	Halo 2 all the way
8930000	8932000	If it was Halo 2 beating it then I'd be a little more
8932000	8934000	Sympathetic but Halo Reach no
8934000	8936000	No
8936000	8938000	But those are just some of the matchups
8938000	8940000	If you want to vote I will post the link
8940000	8942000	Again in chat if you're listening live
8942000	8944000	The Brestler region closes in
8944000	8946000	20 minutes
8946000	8948000	So you better vote now bitches
8948000	8950000	Yeah Donovan regional closed
8950000	8952000	Monday night, Harper regional closed Wednesday
8952000	8954000	Night and since it was late on OLR
8954000	8956000	OLR region will close Friday night
8956000	8958000	Alright and you'll be posting all the updates
8958000	8960000	In our forums at orangeandlongestrader.com correct?
8960000	8962000	Yes and probably here before
8962000	8964000	You guys sign off I will have the results of the Brestler
8964000	8966000	Region so you see what games go on and what
8966000	8968000	Faces what so Alright sounds good
8968000	8970000	Thank you for putting this all together it sounds
8970000	8972000	It's a little fun nerd stuff but fun
8972000	8974000	Yeah
8974000	8976000	I gotta ask before I go who do you
8976000	8978000	Got this year who do you think is gonna win? Who do I think
8978000	8980000	Is gonna win this year? Duh Super Metroid
8980000	8982000	It needs to reclaim the throne of course
8982000	8984000	I wouldn't
8984000	8986000	Be upset if Final Fantasy 6 won
8986000	8988000	For a game
8988000	8990000	Because Final Fantasy 6 has never won before
8990000	8992000	Right? No it got to the finals for the
8992000	8994000	First time last year I would be okay with that
8994000	8996000	What other games have gotten really close but haven't won
8996000	8998000	Yet
8998000	9000000	Link to the past
9000000	9002000	Ocarina of Time
9002000	9004000	Super Mario Brothers
9004000	9006000	And Mega Man 2 all have gotten really close
9006000	9008000	I would be okay with any of those
9008000	9010000	Winning the whole thing except for
9010000	9012000	Ocarina of Time
9012000	9014000	I'm gonna start
9014000	9016000	Ocarina of Time is just like Chrono Trigger
9016000	9018000	To me I don't understand everybody's hard on
9018000	9020000	For it I don't
9020000	9022000	Link to the past forever
9022000	9024000	Yeah but anyways guys
9024000	9026000	That's it I will
9026000	9028000	I will talk to you guys probably next week here

9052000	9054000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
9056000	9058000	Hello you're
9058000	9060000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
9060000	9062000	Hey what's up guys
9062000	9064000	This is Kaijuto Hey Kaijuto there you are
9064000	9066000	What's up buddy
9066000	9068000	Not much I just called to recommend
9068000	9070000	The game to you guys Please do what game?
9070000	9072000	It's a PC game
9072000	9074000	It's first person shooter I heard you all
9074000	9076000	Talking about you were fans of
9076000	9078000	The original GoldenEye for the N64
9078000	9080000	The original GoldenEye was pretty badass I liked it
9080000	9082000	Alright well then
9082000	9084000	You need to pick up this mod you need
9084000	9086000	You need Steam of course you need
9086000	9088000	Either Half Life 2
9088000	9090000	I'm not gonna get into all of the games but you know what I'm saying
9090000	9092000	When I say you need a Valve game you need Half Life 2
9092000	9094000	Or Portal
9094000	9096000	Or Team Fortress you know one of those
9096000	9098000	Actually is it Team Fortress I'm not sure
9098000	9100000	Just get Half Life 2 Deathmatch which is just $4.99
9100000	9102000	You get that and then you can
9102000	9104000	Download this GoldenEye source mod
9104000	9106000	Which is the best freaking game
9106000	9108000	Period that I've ever played
9108000	9110000	I think you all need to check it out
9110000	9112000	Interesting you're a big Half Life fan
9112000	9114000	I am hugely into Half Life 2
9114000	9116000	And the source
9116000	9118000	Half Life 2 engine I've played a ton of
9118000	9120000	Mods and add-ons
9120000	9122000	Expansions that are fan made for Half Life 2
9122000	9124000	And I know exactly what he's talking about
9124000	9126000	I haven't checked it out
9126000	9128000	But yeah I will now
9128000	9130000	I've heard of this it looks pretty awesome
9130000	9132000	Yeah they just went out of beta
9132000	9134000	Maybe people have played it before
9134000	9136000	You know I guess it was version 2
9136000	9138000	Version 3 and maybe they didn't like it
9138000	9140000	But this new update
9140000	9142000	The release version
9142000	9144000	Oh my god it'll blow you away
9144000	9146000	The maps are just incredible
9146000	9148000	The first person shooter maps you'll ever play
9148000	9150000	And the first person shooter to date
9150000	9152000	And I mean that
9152000	9154000	I'll ban myself from all games
9154000	9156000	If you guys don't like that game
9156000	9158000	That's how dedicated I am
9158000	9160000	You don't have to do that
9160000	9162000	Everybody has different opinions
9162000	9164000	I'll check it out especially if it's kind of cheap
9164000	9166000	I think I already have Half Life 2
9166000	9168000	I can't remember if I have it on PC
9168000	9170000	I think I've been playing it on Xbox
9170000	9172000	But I have Portal and Team Fortress
9172000	9174000	Portal should be enough
9174000	9176000	Any game that uses the Source SDK
9176000	9178000	In the Half Life 2 family
9178000	9180000	Will let you run this add-on
9180000	9182000	So Portal should do it
9182000	9184000	I guess I'll have to check that out
9184000	9186000	And we'll see if this guy gets banned
9186000	9188000	From all games forever
9188000	9190000	Me mishearing you for a second
9190000	9192000	I mean it though
9192000	9194000	You really need to check that game out
9194000	9196000	I think these guys need to be supported
9196000	9198000	I think they spent about 5 years making this mod
9198000	9200000	And it really shows
9200000	9202000	I mean the maps
9202000	9204000	They had the original maps from the N64 game
9204000	9206000	And then they built their own maps
9206000	9208000	And you're just like
9208000	9210000	How the heck can they do all this
9210000	9212000	It's just really great
9212000	9214000	Well I'm all for supporting the community
9214000	9216000	But Dark Soccer, what did you want to say?
9216000	9218000	I misheard you when you said Team Fortress
9218000	9220000	And for a moment it sounded like you said Team Fortress
9220000	9222000	So now I'm thinking about
9222000	9224000	A big deathmatch game with a bunch of angsty teenagers
9224000	9226000	Wouldn't that just be Battle Royale?
9226000	9228000	Team Titans
9228000	9230000	You're giving me a mod idea now
9230000	9232000	Seriously there should be a Battle Royale mod
9232000	9234000	Like you have the jock
9234000	9236000	And then you have the emo kid
9236000	9238000	And you have the goth
9238000	9240000	Well you know the emo kid would just be busy cutting himself
9240000	9242000	His hair of course
9242000	9244000	Breakfast club frag edition
9244000	9246000	Yeah
9246000	9248000	I mean you've got your different classes
9248000	9250000	Your clicks
9250000	9252000	And they're a different class
9252000	9254000	The cheerleader
9254000	9256000	Is athletic and can kick people in the face
9256000	9258000	And has the booby attack
9258000	9260000	Nice
9260000	9262000	And then there's the football player
9262000	9264000	Who's like really big and stupid
9264000	9266000	Well Kaijuto
9266000	9268000	I'm definitely going to have to check out this GoldenEye mod
9268000	9270000	Because I did enjoy the GoldenEye on the 64
9270000	9272000	I even really enjoyed what I played
9272000	9274000	The Wii version at E3
9274000	9276000	I didn't want to plunk down 50 bucks for it
9276000	9278000	But maybe when it goes to the bargain bin
9278000	9280000	I'll probably check it out a little more
9280000	9282000	Just because my Wii is not really my gaming console
9282000	9284000	Of choice right now
9284000	9286000	It's still in a box from when I moved a year ago
9286000	9288000	Sad
9288000	9290000	I played the Wii version first
9290000	9292000	And then when I got it on GoldenEye source
9292000	9294000	It totally dwarfed the Wii's version
9294000	9296000	The online part of it
9296000	9298000	I mean they don't have a story version
9298000	9300000	And I do like the Wii's story version of GoldenEye
9300000	9302000	But multiplayer
9302000	9304000	There's nothing like it
9304000	9306000	You really need to check it out
9306000	9308000	When I last heard of this GoldenEye mod
9308000	9310000	Specifically it was still in alpha
9310000	9312000	This was months and months ago which is why I never checked it out
9312000	9314000	But the one Half-Life 2 mod
9314000	9316000	I really need to come out this year
9316000	9318000	Is Black Mesa
9318000	9320000	The Half-Life 1 remake
9320000	9322000	That's been vaporware for six years
9322000	9324000	Now that this GoldenEye
9324000	9326000	Is actually in beta and going to have a release
9326000	9328000	Version soon
9328000	9330000	This needs to light the fire
9330000	9332000	Under the butt of those that are working on Black Mesa source
9332000	9334000	I need it to happen
9334000	9336000	Well unfortunately we lost the caller there
9336000	9338000	I don't know if he accidentally hung up on us
9338000	9340000	Or if there was a connection issue
9340000	9342000	I swear I didn't click a button to hang up on him
9342000	9344000	And we will definitely check out that game
9344000	9346000	In the future
9346000	9348000	So our Skype line is back open again
9348000	9350000	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype
9350000	9352000	1877 Game OLR is our phone number
9352000	9354000	You can give us a call
9354000	9356000	I'll just throw over to Loki real quick
9356000	9358000	If you have any last minute stories you want to throw out there
9358000	9360000	I don't know
9360000	9362000	Just real quick, Arcade Infinity is not closing after all
9362000	9364000	That's right
9364000	9366000	There's a story about that on our very own website
9366000	9368000	And yeah they still had a big party this weekend
9368000	9370000	Just to kind of celebrate
9370000	9372000	So that's good
9372000	9374000	Well congratulations to Arcade Infinity
9374000	9376000	Hopefully it's not like
9376000	9378000	Only open for three more months and then
9378000	9380000	Psych we closed again
9380000	9382000	Well it was some weird thing where like it was actually the city
9382000	9384000	That didn't want them to stay open
9384000	9386000	Yeah I heard about that
9386000	9388000	Something about their business license being really expensive
9388000	9390000	Well let's go to the phones because we got another call on the line
9390000	9392000	Hi caller you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
9392000	9394000	This is Brad from Pod Culture
9394000	9396000	Hey Brad I haven't heard from you in a long time
9396000	9398000	How are you doing buddy?
9398000	9400000	I'm going bald
9400000	9402000	Sounds like me
9402000	9404000	Well what's new in your world?
9404000	9406000	DC Universe Online
9406000	9408000	Ah of course there's a lot of nerds
9408000	9410000	Very happy that this is out this week
9410000	9412000	What do you think?
9412000	9414000	I'm loving it
9414000	9416000	It's still got its issues
9416000	9418000	Like any of those kind of games at launch
9418000	9420000	But I am really digging it
9420000	9422000	Because I am a huge kind of nerd
9422000	9424000	PS3 or PC?
9424000	9426000	PS3
9426000	9428000	Actually the way the controls
9428000	9430000	Feel
9430000	9432000	It actually feels like it's made for
9432000	9434000	A console
9434000	9436000	You're actually right in that regard
9436000	9438000	I think because even when I was playing it on the PC
9438000	9440000	I plugged in the Xbox 360 controller
9440000	9442000	Which is a little weird because the game wasn't made for that
9442000	9444000	But it works
9444000	9446000	And what's really interesting too is that when you do
9446000	9448000	Plug in the joystick all the little button
9448000	9450000	Symbols change to the Playstation
9450000	9452000	X's and O's
9452000	9454000	Which is weird if you're using a 360 controller
9454000	9456000	You've been gaming long enough
9456000	9458000	You know where those buttons are by
9458000	9460000	Feel
9460000	9462000	So cool, are you playing a hero or a villain?
9462000	9464000	Right now playing a hero
9464000	9466000	And how's that going?
9466000	9468000	What level are you?
9468000	9470000	I am about back up to where I was with the beta
9470000	9472000	I think I'm level 12 or 13
9472000	9474000	Nice
9474000	9476000	It was a little bit of an ordeal to get my game
9476000	9478000	Oh no
9478000	9480000	Amazon screwed up a shipment
9480000	9482000	Do you notice there's a lot of people
9482000	9484000	In that right now?
9484000	9486000	I'm getting knocked off
9486000	9488000	Every once in a while
9488000	9490000	Having some connection issues
9490000	9492000	So I don't know if it's my end here
9492000	9494000	Or just that everybody
9494000	9496000	Happens to be on the crisis server
9496000	9498000	Or not
9498000	9500000	How much patching
9500000	9502000	Did you have to do that first day?
9502000	9504000	Oh the first day I had about an 11 gig
9504000	9506000	Download
9506000	9508000	Oh my gosh, 11 gigs?
9508000	9510000	It seemed like it, it took a long time
9510000	9512000	That is
9512000	9514000	Crazy, wow
9514000	9516000	Well how is it playing an MMO on the PS3?
9516000	9518000	Do you think MMOs can work on the PS3?
9518000	9520000	Now that this, you know, big
9520000	9522000	Cause I think this is kind of the first one
9522000	9524000	There was APB I guess, but this is really
9524000	9526000	One of the first big ones I guess that's out
9526000	9528000	If they can make it
9528000	9530000	This kind of a controls game
9530000	9532000	It could probably work
9532000	9534000	It's pretty nice
9534000	9536000	Are you able to talk to
9536000	9538000	Other people okay?
9538000	9540000	You do not need to do that in your experiences
9540000	9542000	With DC Universe online
9542000	9544000	Do you use a keyboard or?
9544000	9546000	You can, I went out and got the
9546000	9548000	Keypad for the
9548000	9550000	PS3 controller
9550000	9552000	But
9552000	9554000	Apparently you can do some chat
9554000	9556000	But it's a little weird to get it set up and working right
9556000	9558000	You can just use your Bluetooth
9558000	9560000	Headset
9560000	9562000	Do you find that the text, you can actually read it
9562000	9564000	Cause one of the complaints I've heard about the PS3
9564000	9566000	Version is that the text is very small on
9566000	9568000	It is a little small but I've got a
9568000	9570000	Fairly good size
9570000	9572000	TV so
9572000	9574000	It's alright, it's a little small maybe
9574000	9576000	If you've got a little bit of vision
9576000	9578000	Issues you might have a problem
9578000	9580000	But I'm not seeing too much of a
9580000	9582000	Problem with it
9582000	9584000	What kind of audience would you recommend
9584000	9586000	This game to? Do you think everybody should be checking
9586000	9588000	It out or is this only for the hardcore right now
9588000	9590000	Or what?
9590000	9592000	I mean if you like
9592000	9594000	City of Heroes
9594000	9596000	That kind of stuff, it's definitely worth checking out
9596000	9598000	Alright
9598000	9600000	I think I might have to check this out but
9600000	9602000	Gosh, games are so expensive these days
9602000	9604000	And I already have one MMO I'm subscribed to
9604000	9606000	I don't need $30 a month
9606000	9608000	To play MMOs, boy oh boy
9608000	9610000	Yeah but you can get a good one now
9610000	9612000	Nice, I see what you did there
9612000	9614000	Alright well Brad, we gotta let you go
9614000	9616000	But do you have any other thoughts for us?
9616000	9618000	Nope, nope, just keep on doing what you're doing
9618000	9620000	And we'll keep listening
9620000	9622000	Alright thank you so much and check out Brad's show
9622000	9624000	It's available at podculture.net
9624000	9626000	Podculture.net and
9626000	9628000	Soon to be podculture.com
9628000	9630000	Cause we are switching over to a new host
9630000	9632000	We're gonna be an indie show again
9632000	9634000	Nice, alright well welcome to the indie
9634000	9636000	Realm I suppose and
9636000	9638000	You can of course always look him up on iTunes
9638000	9640000	Which is kind of the king of podcasts there
9640000	9642000	Alright, take care everybody
9642000	9644000	Later guys
9644000	9646000	It's good to hear from Brad, it's been a very long time
9646000	9648000	We've heard from Brad, so glad to hear
9648000	9650000	He's back into gaming with whatever
9650000	9652000	We can probably do at least
9652000	9654000	One more call here, 1-877-GAMELR
9654000	9656000	Our username on Skype is
9656000	9658000	OrangeLoungeRadio
9658000	9660000	We'll get to at least one more call here before we wrap it up
9660000	9662000	Any other last minute stories?
9662000	9664000	Uh, I'm sure
9664000	9666000	I do have some
9666000	9668000	Let's see here
9668000	9670000	Of course I don't have them pulled up
9670000	9672000	Oh that's alright
9672000	9674000	You're saved by the Skype line, but get those up
9674000	9676000	While we take this last call
9676000	9678000	Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9678000	9680000	Oh you seem to always know how to get through
9680000	9682000	What's on your mind buddy?
9682000	9684000	Not too much, um
9684000	9686000	In reference to Funko Land, you got me
9686000	9688000	Thinking way back
9688000	9690000	As a little kid
9690000	9692000	In elementary school
9692000	9694000	Reading the magazines, hearing about the
9694000	9696000	Fun Club, going out
9696000	9698000	Getting boxes, packing up
9698000	9700000	My Nintendo games, calling
9700000	9702000	Them, getting the prices
9702000	9704000	Packing it up, sending it to them
9704000	9706000	Waiting about a week and a half
9706000	9708000	Getting some brand new
9708000	9710000	Nintendo games and playing them for hours upon hours
9710000	9712000	Oh yeah, that's how
9712000	9714000	I got my copy of Ultima 3 Exodus
9714000	9716000	On the NES was through Funko Land
9716000	9718000	It's not like I remember
9718000	9720000	Playing Renegade a long time ago
9720000	9722000	Then I remembered that game sometime later
9722000	9724000	And I started getting my hands on that
9724000	9726000	And I believed Dragon Warrior 3
9726000	9728000	Uh huh
9728000	9730000	That was my thing
9730000	9732000	It got to the point where I couldn't
9732000	9734000	Get all the games I wanted
9734000	9736000	I figured I had all these stacks of games
9736000	9738000	Might as well do something with it
9738000	9740000	And then I find out there's a Funko Land
9740000	9742000	And then during my
9742000	9744000	Junior high and high school years
9744000	9746000	That was my hangout spot
9746000	9748000	I would go there all the time
9748000	9750000	I met a lot of friends and stuff like that
9750000	9752000	And then eventually I stopped
9752000	9754000	Going because half the managers got sent
9754000	9756000	To different stores and the newer managers
9756000	9758000	Are assholes, so I was like
9758000	9760000	There was no point in going
9760000	9762000	And then one day I just happened to roll in there
9762000	9764000	And I go to the front counter
9764000	9766000	And I'm like, can I get a price sheet?
9766000	9768000	And they're like, we don't do price sheets anymore
9768000	9770000	And you have to go to the back of the line
9770000	9772000	And I turn around
9772000	9774000	I see this long line of people
9774000	9776000	And I said, to hell with this, and I walked out
9778000	9780000	Ha ha ha ha
9780000	9782000	So is there a GameStop
9782000	9784000	Where that Funko Land used to sit?
9784000	9786000	Yeah
9786000	9788000	Yeah, it really is
9788000	9790000	And
9790000	9792000	Where I used to live, one of my best friends
9792000	9794000	From high school, he finally told me
9794000	9796000	Like, maybe about six months or so ago
9796000	9798000	They finally turned the
9798000	9800000	Software, etc. in our old shopping center
9800000	9802000	Into Funko Land
9802000	9804000	Ha ha ha
9804000	9806000	Wow
9806000	9808000	Yeah, I didn't think it would take like 15 years
9808000	9810000	For them to change the logo on the front
9810000	9812000	Uh
9812000	9814000	Yeah, you know, there's a store in
9814000	9816000	Where was it that we were at?
9816000	9818000	It was in Oregon, and we were in what
9818000	9820000	Was it Ashland? No, Medford
9820000	9822000	Is the city right north of Ashland
9822000	9824000	When we went inside, it was a GameStop
9824000	9826000	It was just a GameStop
9826000	9828000	They had the white neon software, etc.
9828000	9830000	And it was like 1993 again
9830000	9832000	I know, and I had to buy a game there
9832000	9834000	Because I'm like, dude, it's a software center, I gotta buy a game here
9834000	9836000	But even the receipt on it said GameStop
9836000	9838000	It was sad
9838000	9840000	Well, slowly everything becomes a part of the machine
9840000	9842000	What do you think about the GameStop ID, though?
9842000	9844000	Let me ask you that real quick
9844000	9846000	Since you brought up that whole thing
9846000	9848000	Because I'm anti-GameStop in the first place
9848000	9850000	You're anti the man
9850000	9852000	Stick it to the man
9852000	9854000	Yes, I'll say it once, I'll say it again
9854000	9856000	Fuck GameStop
9856000	9858000	Alright, well on that note, we're gonna let you go, buddy
9858000	9860000	Cool
9860000	9862000	But have a good one
9862000	9864000	Reminiscing about the good old days with
9864000	9866000	DJ Rama S
9866000	9868000	Any other last minute stories?
9868000	9870000	Loki?
9870000	9872000	Um, yeah, a couple things
9872000	9874000	This is actually kind of funny
9874000	9876000	2, you know, the new one that's coming out on PSP
9876000	9878000	They're actually selling it in a 2-pack
9878000	9880000	In, um,
9880000	9882000	Japan
9882000	9884000	It's a double enlistment pack
9884000	9886000	It contains two UMD copies of the game
9886000	9888000	In their full packaging
9888000	9890000	Bundled together for
9890000	9894000	6,279 yen
9894000	9896000	Versus
9896000	9902000	Buying two 5,040 yen copies
9902000	9904000	So you're saving almost
9904000	9906000	Almost the price of one whole copy
9906000	9908000	Nice, I like these whole
9908000	9910000	Buy multiples, get one free
9910000	9912000	Alright, I lied, we're gonna take one more call
9912000	9914000	Because it's still ringing
9914000	9916000	So I guess I don't know why everybody wants to call tonight
9916000	9918000	Some nights we're sitting here begging for calls
9918000	9920000	But some nights, we got a busy line
9920000	9922000	So, hi, you're on Orange on Australia, who's this?
9922000	9924000	This is the head of the anti-Bimani
9924000	9926000	In the USL Madness tournament
9926000	9928000	Hi, Bobby, how are you?
9928000	9930000	I'm doing good
9930000	9932000	You guys have a good show tonight
9932000	9934000	Yeah, I'm having a good time
9934000	9936000	I hope you've had a good time listening
9936000	9938000	You always have us on at the end of your show
9938000	9940000	So I'm always happy when you're able to get in
9940000	9942000	Amongst the Skype Madness and be on the end of our show
9942000	9944000	That's right
9944000	9946000	I want everybody to vote against Poppin
9946000	9948000	And Para Para
9948000	9950000	And DDR, which got a buy
9950000	9952000	How did that even get in there?
9952000	9954000	Because too many people put it up towards the top of their list
9954000	9956000	You have to remember, our station started as a museum
9956000	9958000	So a lot of the people
9958000	9960000	We have a lot of players, the thick and thin
9960000	9962000	And some of the tough decisions we've made
9962000	9964000	But we do have a lot of fans of that
9964000	9966000	And, obviously, USL has their listenership as well
9966000	9968000	But I know a lot of it is crossover
9968000	9970000	This show, in some ways, was a spinoff of USL
9970000	9972000	So we have many listeners from back in that day
9972000	9974000	And I'm gonna say
9974000	9976000	I'm like you, I wouldn't be mad
9976000	9978000	If Final Fantasy VI won
9978000	9980000	As long as Super Metroid doesn't win
9980000	9982000	Oh, hater, why you hating?
9982000	9984000	Why you hating on Super Metroid?
9984000	9986000	Because it sucks
9986000	9988000	It does not suck
9988000	9990000	It's the most amazing video game ever made
9990000	9992000	Why are you hating on Super Metroid?
9992000	9994000	Because Super Metroid mimics a vacuum
9998000	10000000	Is it sad that I actually had to stop and think about that one for it?
10000000	10002000	I'm like, you don't play in a vacuum
10002000	10004000	What are you talking about?
10004000	10006000	Oh, you Bobby
10006000	10008000	Curse you, Bobby
10008000	10010000	Bobby, you just launched a new website for your show, right?
10010000	10012000	I did, bobbyblackwolf.com
10012000	10014000	And the podcast is back
10014000	10016000	The podcast feed is more up to date than ours
10016000	10018000	But that will all change this week
10018000	10020000	Here's the thing, my episode from tonight
10020000	10022000	Already on the podcast feed
10022000	10024000	Wow, amazing
10024000	10026000	That hasn't happened in three years
10026000	10028000	Good gosh
10028000	10030000	You need to cancel doing second shows more often
10030000	10032000	Exactly
10032000	10034000	And I reviewed the Telltale game Back to the Future
10034000	10036000	On my show
10036000	10038000	So people can go check that out
10038000	10040000	I guess we have to go check it out to see what you really think
10040000	10042000	But I was gonna say
10042000	10044000	Earlier, I'm really looking forward to the Jurassic Park game
10044000	10046000	I don't know why, but
10046000	10048000	I think it's because I like the books when I was younger
10048000	10050000	And I remember seeing the original movies
10050000	10052000	Except three, who bothered with three
10052000	10054000	But I'm kind of excited
10054000	10056000	To revisit those
10056000	10058000	Because it's been a long time since those movies were out
10058000	10060000	And that whole
10060000	10062000	Stuff was big
10062000	10064000	They never did make a fourth movie
10064000	10066000	I don't know if they were ever going to
10066000	10068000	But it would be kind of fun to revisit that world, I think
10068000	10070000	Yeah, and one of the things is when Heavy Rain came out
10070000	10072000	I even said
10072000	10074000	I would love to play a Telltale game like
10074000	10076000	Sam & Max using the Heavy Rain style of
10076000	10078000	Controls
10078000	10080000	And now that's what they're going to be doing for
10080000	10082000	Jurassic Park
10082000	10084000	Doing more Heavy Rain type stuff
10084000	10086000	Than just point and click adventures
10086000	10088000	And hopefully if it works for Jurassic Park
10088000	10090000	They'll do that in Sam & Max
10090000	10092000	And probably add some of that
10092000	10094000	Will there be a Jason scene in Jurassic Park?
10094000	10096000	Jason!
10096000	10098000	And I want to see a T-Rex holding a red balloon
10098000	10100000	And it's going
10100000	10102000	And it's going
10102000	10104000	And it's going
10104000	10106000	Jason!
10106000	10108000	Can't wait
10108000	10110000	Alright Bobby, anything else on your mind tonight
10110000	10112000	Before we wrap up our little show here?
10112000	10114000	No, I mean
10114000	10116000	Breslow wants to kick me, but once again
10116000	10118000	Vote against DDR
10118000	10120000	He'll deal with it
10120000	10122000	Every gamer has a voice
10122000	10124000	Even when they're wrong, like you are
10124000	10126000	All I gotta say is the next
10126000	10128000	Was it Poker Night
10128000	10130000	At the inventory or whatever?
10130000	10132000	It's going to be awesome
10132000	10134000	Was it Christopher Lloyd
10134000	10136000	And a T-Rex
10136000	10138000	And a Velociraptor
10138000	10140000	I'm the whole Jason
10140000	10142000	Alright
10142000	10144000	Bobby, thanks so much for your call
10144000	10146000	Take care
10146000	10148000	Thank you
10148000	10150000	Bobby Blackwolf, the man who does the show before us
10150000	10152000	You go all in on the next Poker Night
10152000	10154000	At the inventory at the Velociraptor
10154000	10156000	He's so pissed, he just eats strong bad
10156000	10158000	Violently, gruesomely
10158000	10160000	That's great
10160000	10162000	Alright, any other last minute stories
10162000	10164000	Before we wrap up the show tonight
10164000	10166000	Minecraft has sold a million copies
10166000	10168000	Which is pretty awesome
10168000	10170000	They have a new update for that
10170000	10172000	As well that adds
10172000	10174000	I still haven't played it, am I a bad gamer?
10174000	10176000	I haven't really played it either
10176000	10178000	I'm a bad gamer
10178000	10180000	Let's see
10180000	10182000	They added
10182000	10184000	Some new recipes including
10184000	10186000	Squids and cake
10186000	10188000	Yes
10188000	10190000	So you can get cake in the game
10190000	10192000	And I guess squids are a new enemy of course
10192000	10194000	So that's pretty cool
10194000	10196000	And yeah I guess from the squids
10196000	10198000	You can harvest black ink
10198000	10200000	For a new dye mechanic
10204000	10206000	Let's see what else
10206000	10208000	Remedy is bringing Death Rally
10208000	10210000	For the iPhone
10210000	10212000	Death Rally you may remember
10212000	10214000	As an old
10214000	10216000	Apogee game
10216000	10218000	Back from 1996
10218000	10220000	Kind of a top down
10220000	10222000	Combat racing game
10222000	10224000	Which is kind of cool
10224000	10226000	And then speaking of
10226000	10228000	IOS, the iPad has
10228000	10230000	A bunch of ridiculous peripherals
10230000	10232000	That were being shown off at
10232000	10234000	CES and of course
10234000	10236000	One of these is the
10236000	10238000	iCade which transforms to your
10238000	10240000	iPod or your iPad I guess
10240000	10242000	Into an arcade and you can get that ThinkGeek
10242000	10244000	For $100 or if you don't want to
10244000	10246000	Spend $100 but you still want
10246000	10248000	Some sort of tactile controller
10248000	10250000	They have a stick on
10250000	10252000	Joystick actually
10252000	10254000	For $25 and it just
10254000	10256000	Sticks onto your
10256000	10258000	iPad
10258000	10260000	Maybe Apple should release one
10260000	10262000	I think they should
10262000	10264000	Honestly I think they should have something
10264000	10266000	The iPhone or whatever plugs into
10266000	10268000	Apple if they want to just do Bluetooth
10268000	10270000	Support for controllers or something
10270000	10272000	That would be awesome
10272000	10274000	It's what the people want
10274000	10276000	Now that Verizon has their iPhone they're just going to sell even more
10276000	10278000	Of them and it's just like if they were to release
10278000	10280000	Just a little controller that plugs into
10280000	10282000	The bottom of those phones I tell you it's over
10282000	10284000	Yeah
10284000	10286000	So
10286000	10288000	Is that it? That's it
10288000	10290000	Alright well that's going to do it for another episode

10350000	10352000	I've never had better yogurt in my life
10352000	10354000	It is great they need to keep that as a permanent flavor
10354000	10356000	If they get rid of that I'm going to be pissed
10356000	10358000	Yeah I'm excited about food again

10374000	10376000	one that was designed back in the day
