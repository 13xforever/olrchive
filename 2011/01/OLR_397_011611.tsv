10279	24871	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, January 16th, 2011 Another MMO is set to go free to play this month An upcoming fighting game plans to punish Rage Quitters And will the 3DS be re-delocked after all?
31806	38150	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
38190	44735	We tape live at All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
45135	45996	My name is Rob Roberts.
46036	48858	I'll be joining you for the next few hours along with my co-host.
49298	50619	Not here tonight, sadly.
50679	54300	The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers, is absent from the studio tonight.
54800	59683	She may be coming about halfway through the show, but she is out at a pinball collecting type of event.
60263	62704	It's a private thing, so it's not something you would have read about on the internet.
63284	64705	But she's having a pretty good time.
64745	68226	I know I got a text from her earlier today that she met some famous pinball maker.
68266	72688	So hopefully she makes it back in time during the show and we can ask her all about her experience there.
73088	74089	I know there was beer involved.
74429	75170	TechMasterLoki
96414	97254	Say hello everybody to Salacious Pop
118905	119305	Hello.
119565	120386	How are you, SlicesPop?
120506	121046	I'm great.
121206	121466	Yeah?
121806	124208	I'm pinch-hitting for Jamie, and I get to read stories.
124588	125548	It'll be very fun.
125648	125868	Yes.
126129	126349	Yes.
126969	132952	If anyone hears a thud, it's because Rob threw a shoe at me because I missed my story cue, and I'm letting there be dead air.
134012	137354	So if you hear a thud, stuff happened today.
137594	139035	Yeah, that's what happened there.
139375	140615	So otherwise, looking forward to it.
140895	141336	Should be fun.
141516	142096	Yeah, should be fun.
142196	144296	Again, I don't know how long DarkSakura is going to be out.
144356	147417	She didn't really give a firm time because I think she just kind of didn't know.
147837	150138	You know, sometimes you get invited to those things and you're like, I don't know.
150438	152379	And I get the sense it might be a little far away.
152399	153319	It might be in the Bay Area.
153399	156440	So if they haven't even left the par-tay yet, she might be gone for a while.
156700	159541	Yeah, so she might show up and just be like, you get the hell up out my seat.
159681	159981	Yeah.
160641	161882	Give me my mic and get out.
161942	165523	And that's when I'm going to bail to the living room and she'll take over stories.
166083	166344	All right.
166384	172386	Go into the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where we have the live chatters every Sunday night while we do tape.
172906	175988	I'm noticing Actdeft in our chat room says, DarkSakura ain't home.
176048	176608	Party!
177348	178609	Actually, it is a little weird.
178669	180230	We're in her house right now.
180410	187213	And she's very kind, her and Dan, really, because he lives here too, letting us kind of come in and do our show anyway.
188094	193317	I have the super secret way of getting in the house when they're not here that I can't say because we don't want the robbers to show up.
193697	197899	But yeah, she's very kind in letting us kind of take over the house.
198199	201301	But it's a little weird, I think, to be in someone's house when they're not here.
201601	203142	And it's not like a house-sitting type of thing.
203402	204423	Like, I didn't feed Shermie.
205403	206583	Jeremy doesn't need to be fed.
206704	207904	Jeremy's just asleep.
207924	208924	Jeremy don't give a shit tonight.
209845	210305	But anyhow.
210805	211065	All right.
211385	216187	Enough talk about being in the house when the owners aren't home and kitties and so forth.
216207	217207	Let's talk about video games.
217227	219488	And we'll start off tonight with how is your gaming week?
219848	221988	We have to mix it up a little bit tonight because DarkSakura's not here.
222028	222729	So we'll start with Loki.
222769	223449	How is your gaming week?
224097	225078	Um, it was alright.
225218	227160	I didn't play a ton of things.
227540	231343	We have the new mod games going for Grand Theft Auto, so we've been playing that this week.
231943	236947	It's weird though, like, we've been running into a bunch of strange glitches and I'm not really sure what it's from.
237047	253360	I think it might be some leftover data that's in the save files or something, but we have it set to all of our cop cars are flying around and stuff, but for some reason when we're playing the single player game, some of the cop cars don't fly, so it makes me think that some of the old data is in there.
254080	273397	and then also we've been having issues with cars disappearing on us so it'll look like we're flying around and we're impervious to fire in free mode for some reason and it's odd because I didn't even touch any of those files that would affect that so it's just a bunch of strange glitches but I'm working on it.
274718	279182	And then other than that I played a little bit of...
281067	282308	What did I play this week, actually?
283049	289594	Oh, I tried a bit of Angry Birds because I've had it purchased on my iPod for the longest time now.
290475	293197	And I gotta admit, I don't understand it.
293358	294639	I don't understand what the big draw is.
295099	295720	It's alright.
295880	299923	It's kind of fun, but I got bored of it really quick.
300704	306529	So, I don't know why everyone's so gung-ho about it and have this big raging hard-on for the game because...
307209	308210	It's not that great.
308430	311872	I'm not sure I understand America's obsession with Angry Birds either.
311952	313613	It's definitely not.
313813	315053	It's for an iPhone game.
315073	315694	It's an okay game.
315714	316114	It's fine.
316374	321157	But it's not something like, oh my god, it's got to warrant movie rights and shit like that.
321737	322397	And shirts.
322577	323758	I went into Hot Topic the other day.
323778	325539	There's Angry Birds shirts now.
327334	330437	I just don't get it.
333359	335061	I mean, I don't know.
335902	337483	I've played a lot of addictive games.
337623	346572	If anything, I think Plants vs. Zombies serves more movie rights and that kind of stuff versus stupid Angry Birds.
347072	354160	I'd rather have Angry Birds shirts than Farmville bottled water and hot dogs, which is very real at 7-Eleven.
354240	357904	So yeah, that's a bit absurd, though, for a casual game like that.
358084	359285	Yeah.
359645	361507	And then other things I played this week.
362649	368395	I just realized it's my move in Words with Friends, which is a much more addicting iPhone game than Angry Birds.
368835	369316	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
389099	389840	I have yet to play that.
391061	391941	What did I play this week?
391961	393983	There was some other stuff that I played that was kind of cool.
395705	397866	I've just been downloading a bunch of random things.
399107	402750	I actually downloaded today, it was kind of cool, Earth Defense Force.
403251	414660	Now, not the Earth Defense Force that I've come to love, but the old Earth Defense Force game that was on the Super Nintendo, which I think came out over here.
415561	417723	I want to say UN Squadron, I think was the...
418303	447527	The name of it over here Oh god, I loved UN Squadron The old, yeah, yeah That was a Capcom game years ago I think that's the one It looks similar, I could be wrong But I think it's that game But then there was another one I downloaded Was Raptor Call of Shadows Which is an old shareware game From way back in the day From Apogee So that was pretty sweet So I downloaded that And then, what else did I play
448227	449929	I'm a Mensa member, I'm really smart you guys
475430	476231	I'm not a member.
476931	477972	I take the test.
479914	481355	I can be a certified genius that way.
481816	481976	No?
482696	486059	Ray Iannami in our chatroom says, Area 88 slash UN Squadron.
486159	488942	Actdeft says, UN Squadron does not equal Earth Defense Force.
489522	489803	Ah, yeah.
490703	491444	It just looks similar.
495259	496259	I know there's something else I play.
496279	498060	I think I may play a little bit of Swords and Poker.
498440	499140	That's pretty fun.
500040	503061	I haven't really been doing a whole ton of gaming.
504081	504861	Mainly Grand Theft Auto.
506002	517025	Oh, and actually, I did try... There was a video that was out earlier this week of people playing Grand Theft Auto where the cars didn't really have any friction on them.
517505	518585	So they just kind of...
520186	526649	I have my PC game set up like that right now.
527449	540275	It was something I was going to be trying out even before I saw that video because there's this guy who goes by the name Shadow on the boards that I'm on that he did that and there was another mod that he did that was kind of funky like that.
541055	545058	I'm actually probably going to apply those to the Ballad of Gay Tony stuff.
545819	550983	We've only been playing Lost in Damned so it'd be fun to add that to it.
551383	555686	And then also apparently they're going to be releasing script editing tools soon.
557808	576304	which just opens up the realm of possibilities for Grand Theft Auto modding to all sorts of crazy lengths because if we have access to edit the scripts we can pretty much do whatever we want in the game which is pretty awesome so I'm very excited to see what comes of that that's about it
577364	577644	All right.
577784	579345	Salacious Pop, how was your gaming week?
579385	580846	What kind of games did you play this week?
581386	583647	My gaming week is pretty embarrassing.
584327	585408	Not much to talk about.
585808	586468	Lots of WoW.
587429	590590	And if you want me to talk about that at length, I'll go on your other podcast.
590990	591270	Okay.
591610	595152	Yeah, so I'm just leveling up my main and doing Cataclysm stuff.
596052	613937	I got a 1600 point gift card for XBLA and I finally used it for Christmas so I finally used it and I picked up the Scott Pilgrim game the River City Ransom clone so I tinkered with that a bit and then I also used it to get the Pac-Man Championship Edition DX
616078	636490	and I also have played some Plants vs. Zombies Game of the Year Edition which was a leftover from the Steam sale when I picked it up for like four bucks over Christmas and then Poker Night at the Inventory and I'm now 60 grand in the hole again in my global stat so I need to win two rounds so that's frustrating.
636571	638332	Have you unlocked everything in your Poker Night game yet?
639032	643415	I still have lots of tabletops and card decks to unlock about four left of each.
644975	652777	I know Bobby, the man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio, he talked at length tonight about Back to the Future, the new Telltale game that came out.
652797	654538	Do you have any interest in the Back to the Future games?
655138	660059	I haven't played any of the Sam and Max, and I loved the original one when it was on the SCUMM engine.
660519	666441	So all of the Telltale episodic ones, I haven't really messed with those at all.
667801	675964	And there's also the episodic game that I'm really looking forward to isn't Telltale, sadly, but it's the Penny Arcade one, Precipice of Darkness.
677025	684327	On their website, they wrote the third volume as an actual, like they wrote it out like a fan fiction.
684768	688669	So I guess the third one was just scrapped because they wrote it out instead like a book.
688849	705775	Oh yeah, they had the first game and the second game and then I guess it was kind of a back and forth thing because I remember reading some things about it where there was like a joke on Twitter about if so many people will buy this game when it's discounted they'll make the third game and the Penny Arcade guys basically came out and said actually that's not true, there's not going to be a third game.
706255	709777	I completely missed when that was made official.
710137	712578	All this time for the last three years I was like when are we getting volume three?
712998	713638	I don't think it's happening.
713658	714198	They just wrote it.
714378	714679	Sorry.
714979	715579	Oh, alright.
717489	740112	yeah so that's all uh plans versus zombies in book or night it's kind of like when a show on tv gets canceled and you can like maybe maybe the uh producer will write something on the internet or you can watch the rest of the episodes on cbs.com or whatever when you desperately hope that the uh they were able to to squeeze out two or three episodes to wrap it up after they get canceled it's like no that the seventh episode is it there's no closure at all
740612	742934	What was that freaking show I actually watched?
743575	745196	I think it was Harper's Island or something.
745216	745997	It was on TV.
746037	748038	It was like a murder mystery.
748179	749099	Somebody dies every week.
749139	751301	And I think it got canceled by CBS like halfway through.
751561	754144	And you had to finish watching it on CBS.com.
754904	757146	And it was actually not that good of a show.
757206	759228	I don't know why I watched it every week.
759588	761550	And it had kind of a crappy, guessable ending.
761610	764032	Probably the same reason we watched The Tester or
764332	765572	Probably, probably.
765612	766453	Hey, you know what?
766513	772895	Actually, the tester, the second season of the tester was probably a little better than Harper's Island and less predictable, sadly.
773735	774955	So, there you go.
776156	777596	All sorts of embarrassing TV shows.
777876	782178	Speaking of embarrassing fandom, I will say the Telltale game I'm actually looking forward to is Jurassic Park.
782518	784558	Like, I'm really curious to see what they do with it.
784598	790320	It's such a weird license in some ways for them to have, but I'm kind of excited to see kind of what they do with it.
790600	792561	Do you guys remember the Jurassic Park games from...
792961	794182	What they had on Super Nintendo.
794402	795923	Remember the Super Nintendo Jurassic Park game?
797023	801686	Yeah, it was kind of cool, but at the same time it was a little bit junky.
802226	809370	I remember two games that came out, both platformers, that were night and day between the Super Nintendo and Genesis versions.
809851	812452	And it was Jurassic Park and Aladdin.
813112	816094	When people put on Aladdin for the Genesis, it's like, this is amazing.
816594	817935	And Jurassic Park was the same way.
818495	819556	Way better on the Genesis.
819676	820537	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
836072	836492	Thanks for watching!
856645	861387	Anyhow, we'll stop talking about games from 15 years ago and talk about something a little more current.
861927	862668	My gaming week.
862748	864548	Sadly, not a lot of new stuff.
864988	867029	You know, again, mostly WoW in my world as well.
867089	870831	Still playing a little bit of Fallout 3 as well as some other miscellaneous things here and there.
870931	872191	Not a lot of new stuff I tried out.
872311	879334	I did kind of go to the indie store and I tried a few games on the Xbox Live indie game store because, you know, there's some gems out there once in a while.
879354	879955	You'll find some.
881135	883398	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
901838	903919	I don't know how to explain it.
904039	912501	It looks like a bad CD-ROM game from when CD-ROM first came out where they did these full motion movies or whatever.
912601	922243	And it looks like these guys who made the game rented a room at Motel 6 and got their friends to dress up in maid outfits and just act out these scenes.
923623	924324	Pay them in drinks.
924584	925664	Didn't even pay them in cash.
926144	955488	they got their three cute girlfriends to dress inmates outfit and pay them in drinks yes yeah and it was like like Skinamax movies have more plot than this thing did and it was and then you go into the game itself and it's like you're trying to launch balloons up at seagulls so they don't they don't poop on you it's a really like terrible shooter from like the 80s Atari 2600 caliber if someone submitted this game to Newgrounds it would get blammed it would not make it to the flash portal it belongs on Newgrounds it was funny like just how bad it was
955808	973742	and then they had the whole like pouting thing at the end oh they didn't buy the game because they don't like us or whatever and I'm just thinking wow this was somebody's fantasy project I can't even but there's guys with made fetishes that'll have a field day with this so have fun I guess this is kind of a you know
975063	976944	Lights Off, Pants Down kind of game for you guys.
977844	983727	Anyhow, other indie games that are worth much more of your time for checking out was the Slash Pop.
983747	985048	You have to help me remember the name of this game.
985068	986229	It was Cthulhu Saves the World?
986249	987369	Yeah, Cthulhu Saves the World.
987449	992632	Which is by the same guys, I guess, that did Breath of Death 7, which I have yet to play.
993592	996154	Obviously, they love their old school RPGs.
996214	1002957	And I mean like Dragon Warrior on the NES style games or like original Phantasy Star games.
1003257	1003838	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1019930	1020670	Thanks for watching!
1036397	1043682	Oh, and the other thing I gotta say I like, they had this whole system where the most number of random battles you'll ever get into in a dungeon is 25.
1045043	1049466	But if you want to fight more random encounters, you can go to the main menu and select Fight.
1049806	1052848	And it's kind of like you will purposefully go into another random encounter fight.
1053328	1054930	That's a really neat kind of system.
1054970	1056451	Like, somebody really kind of thought that one out.
1056491	1063876	Like, how to make it... You remember, like, there'd be certain dungeons in Final Fantasy games where, like, every two steps it was like, walk, walk.
1063896	1064516	Bloop, bloop, bloop!
1064776	1065216	Thanks for watching!
1081229	1083530	Yeah, I thought that was, it has some neat ideas.
1083570	1087412	So I like that it's trying to take that really old 8-bit idea and make it better.
1088113	1098078	It still felt a little bit like a grind fest to me, but the humor in the game makes it, I think, a little more bearable and makes you kind of curious what joke they're going to tell next.
1098598	1102160	So, and especially for the price, because you know, indie games are very reasonably priced.
1102180	1104061	240 Microsoft points, that's what, three bucks?
1104481	1105942	As much as you pay for something on Game Room.
1106322	1108083	I'd say, heck yeah, why not?
1108163	1108543	Go do it.
1108763	1112425	I was really impressed by the soundtrack in Cthulhu Saves the World.
1112485	1113206	It did have a good soundtrack.
1113226	1113966	Amazing soundtrack.
1114026	1124913	And yeah, it was pretty funny when he, one of the first things you do is you rescue sort of a damsel in distress on the beach and you save her and Cthulhu is like, so am I a hero now?
1125473	1131737	And the narrator's like, you're the dark lord of the eldritch, like hell no, saving a girl isn't going to cut it.
1132278	1133438	We need a little bit more from you.
1133879	1136040	And that was kind of funny how it's very sarcastic.
1136360	1137861	And she has a big crush on him, I think.
1137881	1139902	Yeah, she falls in love with him with his big tentacle mouth.
1140342	1141602	She's like, oh, you are so fine.
1141862	1144764	Are you just waiting for the Uesu Doji scene to come happen?
1144904	1147085	No, that's unpleasant.
1148085	1150686	But I do want to keep playing just to see if that happens.
1151426	1155208	Although I think games on the marketplace can't be too adult.
1155588	1156609	Although somehow this...
1157569	1160871	Borderline Innuendo Maid Game gets on the marketplace.
1161371	1162912	I mean, granted, there's no titty.
1163772	1166434	The game would have been ten times better if there were boobs.
1166454	1171016	There was one with titty in it, but it got... Was that the guy game?
1171457	1172517	No, no, no.
1172877	1179301	There was one that was on the indie games or whatever, and it was some chick or whatever, like this guy's girlfriend who...
1180441	1205980	she wasn't like you know supermodel you know it's just some normal chick that you know they had her in lingerie and shit and that game got yanked really quick though unfortunately I'm waiting for now that we've had maids with balloons I'm just waiting for like furries with guns like I can't wait for there to be like the furry porn game on Xbox Live I'm kind of surprised it hasn't hit yet laughing
1207921	1210642	And then there could be furries with guns versus maids with balloons.
1210702	1212162	It would be crazy.
1212662	1213242	So there you go.
1214103	1216823	By the way, I just got a text message from Miss DarkSakura.
1216843	1218044	She's going to be here in two hours.
1219484	1220684	I don't know if she's going to make it.
1220724	1222905	She's just barely going to hit the end of the show if she gets here.
1223745	1224685	She can do her cage match.
1225426	1225606	Yeah.
1225626	1225906	Really?
1225966	1227546	Well, that's not even the podcast part.
1227566	1227946	Yeah, I know.
1227986	1228486	And FUs.
1228646	1230567	She'll be here for the afterbirth part of the show.
1231287	1232388	I'm trying to think if there was anything else.
1232408	1234289	I want to say there was one other game I had tried.
1234469	1237311	Oh, the cute little arcade game, The Rascals.
1237371	1238112	Was that what it was called?
1238892	1239472	The Skulls?
1239632	1241994	Yeah, with the skulls that was kind of like Mr. Driller.
1242915	1245376	It was Mr. Driller meets the, you know what it was?
1245436	1247638	The Mario Brothers game on Game Boy Color.
1247718	1248538	Did you ever play that?
1249038	1255723	Or Super Mario Brothers on Game Boy Color, where you could link the systems and race Mario and Luigi to beat the level as fast as possible?
1256463	1256783	and DarkSakura.
1273397	1299242	so uh yeah if you're like a fan of the old school 8-bit platformer games especially um you know Mario Brothers type uh it's it's cute um some weird plot devices they use though like I didn't get the whole opening with the ship and the rats I get that they're supposed to be the antagonists but I don't know I I think this game just needed to kind of throw me in and start playing I didn't need all the exposition in the beginning it was a little weird
1299582	1313208	but the game's cute and it's definitely worth checking out the demo if you like either old school games or you like platformer games and you can kind of make your decision in there from there because the demo's pretty robust so you can check that out again that is Rascals was the name of the game
1315609	1317110	That's pretty much it, though, for My Gaming Week.
1317130	1319012	Otherwise, not a whole lot else to report on.
1319052	1320914	So I'll just talk housekeeping real quick.
1321695	1325638	We are still here moving towards our 400th show.
1325718	1327760	It's set for the first week of February.
1328200	1330102	We're tossing around some ideas internally.
1330162	1330743	Nothing yet.
1330803	1337469	I don't think it's going to be too big of a deal because, you know, we've had enough self-serving anniversary episodes amongst our nine-year run.
1337529	1340031	So we plan to do something a little bit special.
1340131	1341212	Actually, right now we're talking...
1342353	1343114	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1358331	1360073	at Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook.
1360093	1361974	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1362434	1363295	How about some news?
1363355	1364496	And we've got a lot of it tonight.
1364536	1366037	It was surprisingly a busy week.
1366678	1371762	I guess now the holidays have officially faded out and people are back at work and so forth.
1372062	1376125	We're getting back into some gaming news for what's going to happen through the summer of this year.
1376726	1378347	And we start tonight with Loki.
1379412	1379672	Oh, yes.
1380152	1385275	And speaking of people being busy, no one's been busier than Sony and their legal team.
1385756	1391919	They've been spending the week suing hackers for hacking the PlayStation 3.
1393080	1403986	Two groups, of course, that they were going after, Fail Overflow, which was the hacking group that, during a recent conference, was talking about how they've basically...
1404586	1405907	Geohot or George Hotz
1421833	1434277	He was the one that actually pioneered the jailbreak for the iPhones and later on went to release the keys for the PlayStation 3 hacking.
1436838	1438198	And yeah, they're not too pleased by it.
1439559	1451062	Of course, they're saying, according to the court documents, the hack violates the DMCA, and that already pirated games are being packaged and distributed with these circumvention devices.
1451623	1454523	Which, by the way, is not true, but that's what they go to claim.
1455244	1455664	And then...
1457805	1460926	Of course, George Hotz made a comment about that.
1461326	1469468	I would expect the company that prides itself on intellectual property to be well-versed in the provisions of the law, so I'm disappointed in Sony's current action.
1470148	1475129	I have spoken with legal counsel, and I'm comfortable that Sony's action against me doesn't have any basis.
1475489	1477490	Well, of course, it's going to continue on from there.
1480211	1481693	So here's how it kind of played out this week.
1482875	1495190	Geohot on his website actually put the keys out there so people had access to them as well as various signing tools and samples of possible ways to install and run Homebrew.
1496091	1513563	um of course you know none of this actually has anything to do with pirating games it's just installing homebrew and in fact um there are some limitations what he's already released um to not allow pirating games at least yet um
1515524	1519247	Then, it's kind of funny, there's just all sorts of stuff going on.
1519267	1522969	I'll try to go a little bit more in detail here.
1523830	1529733	So, there's a few funny things that are kind of going on about this whole court case to begin with.
1530534	1534697	One, Sony decided to, I guess...
1536452	1545018	Get evidence that Hotz was accepting money, donations, basically saying that, oh, he was charging people for these exploits.
1545658	1548160	They actually sent him a dollar to his PayPal account.
1548620	1549961	Sony did, which is kind of weird.
1550761	1563730	And, of course, Hotz's attorneys are saying, Hotz has not produced, manufactured, sold, nor does he have any intent whatsoever to produce, manufacture, sell any devices that facilitate piracy.
1564850	1564990	And...
1567694	1580184	They're saying that basically it dismisses Sony's use of piracy case for precedent because the case involves hardware used to circumvent PSC's protection, not software.
1580868	1581949	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1610826	1612347	You have a Sony's in San Francisco, aren't they?
1613127	1615288	I understand that, but they're taking a case up against him.
1615308	1616589	They have to do it in his jurisdiction.
1616929	1627614	But their thing is basically that he communicated on Twitter and he communicated over using PayPal or something like that.
1627854	1630055	And those two companies reside in Northern California.
1630295	1635117	So therefore... Is this a copyright or trademark issue that they're going for?
1635458	1638259	No, they're going for the fact that he released their public keys.
1639068	1652557	Okay, because I know anything to do with copyright or trademark or whatever is federal, so then you can intentionally file the claim out of state to make the person drag their ass to the court where you filed it to.
1652577	1654418	Well, they basically did that, kind of.
1655819	1656340	It's weird.
1657000	1675256	One of the comments they're saying is, I think it's quite telling that Sony, who legally is required to provide notice to Mr. Hotz before seeking any special relief with the court, decided to email Mr. Hotz a copy of their motion at 7pm when a hearing was scheduled for the next morning at 9am in California, while Mr. Hotz doesn't even live in California.
1675616	1680380	Sony is seeking various unreasonable relief, such as seizing Mr. Hotz's personal property and computers.
1680820	1682581	Luckily, the courts postponed the hearing.
1685183	1686964	They have a bunch of comments from different law firms.
1687104	1695770	Well, I'm pretty sure it's just the big company exercising their big company muscle to try and squelch out this guy who has very limited resources, I'm sure.
1695850	1702255	Even if they don't have a case, they're basically saying, hey buddy, you're going to spend money on a plane ticket to drag your ass out here to defend yourself.
1702475	1703556	Well, here's what it is.
1703716	1711920	And you have to understand, this is bigger than just a hacker hacking Sony stuff.
1711960	1715201	What this does is sets precedent for a few things.
1715922	1722125	There are similar cases that went on when the whole jailbreaking of the iPhone thing happened.
1722325	1725086	And that actually was overturned in courts.
1725286	1730629	And now it is legal to jailbreak your phone because of that court case.
1731349	1733511	Well, this... Interesting comparison.
1733551	1734252	I never thought of that.
1734292	1737416	Sorry, I just had to get that out there, but I didn't realize you're right.
1738256	1741880	What this story is is very similar to the whole jailbreaking your iPhone.
1741920	1746065	It's using your device not the way the company intended, but... Not necessarily.
1746445	1747706	It's even going beyond that.
1748067	1748787	The whole thing is...
1749748	1763993	Remember, when you buy these consoles in their end user license agreement, it's basically making it seem like you're leasing this property that is Sony's and you're paying a fee to basically lease it and really it's their property but it's in your home.
1764353	1773196	This would actually set precedent that this is your console, you can do whatever the fuck you want with it if he ends up winning this case is what it's going to come down to.
1773516	1773896	and so on.
1795607	1796468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1810405	1811727	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1826423	1827565	I don't think they can do that.
1827945	1835095	Well, I mean, they can do that, obviously, but I don't think it would be smart for them to do that regardless because a lot of people don't have the know-how to do this.
1835296	1841925	Although, he went on G4 and made a comment about what the whole case was going on.
1841965	1843006	He doesn't feel that he's...
1843647	1844167	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1872305	1873266	Can I read some comments from chat?
1873286	1877449	Because obviously this is a very passionate issue and some folks in the chat room are kind of lighting up about this.
1878310	1884335	Nick Gertz in our chat room, I don't recognize that name, so welcome if it's your first time, in our chat room says, BS, once you buy something, it's yours.
1884675	1887057	You should be able to do whatever the fuck you want with what you own.
1887277	1888919	Read the end-user license agreement.
1888999	1894343	You may think that and you may feel that that, and I agree, it should be the case, but that's not what they're saying.
1894523	1900668	That's why they're able to patch your PlayStation 3 to remove the other operating system and all that stuff.
1900748	1928227	But the courts may ultimately agree with Nick Yes That's going to be very interesting And then SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says Can't blame Sony for protecting its properties And I think they sort of have an obligation to Because of that agreement that they have with developers That there's all these other companies That if this whole thing ends up going against Sony They have an interest in that too Here's the problem though And this may be Sony's This may be Sony's big
1930891	1931652	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1946474	1949337	So should Sony have waited until piracy was a factor?
1949357	1950699	Well, here's the other thing, too.
1952020	1955263	Geohot has only released... And this is all speculation.
1955404	1958827	He's only released a portion of the key.
1958867	1960108	Basically, he has a...
1961750	1962691	Thanks for watching!
1982725	1986309	He's smart, you see, because he's hoping this court case goes in his favor.
1986629	1990273	If that's the case, then it'll be legal for him to release that key, and it's over.
1990554	1991014	It's done.
1991134	1992135	There's nothing they can do.
1993277	1996560	Once that's out there, there is no way to block that anymore.
1997261	1997701	They're done.
1998803	1999143	It's over.
1999523	2001786	SalaciousPop, you want to say something, and then I'll go to more chat comments.
2002560	2007604	Yeah, this is really just about opening up additional functionality on a console that you own.
2008105	2024537	If it was some type of hack where, I don't know, you could pull games down from the PlayStation Network, like their store that was a demo, and unlock it, completely different thing I'm talking about here, where you could then play the full version of the game without paying for it, then yes, that's something that would hurt the developer, but that's...
2025578	2026399	Completely different.
2026459	2027700	That's not what we're dealing with here.
2027760	2031582	It's just opening up the console for, you know, Homebrew and whatever else.
2031602	2035144	Now granted, everyone doesn't necessarily share that same ideal.
2035225	2038587	I mean, there's people out there that are just like, okay, how can I use this to pirate stuff?
2038647	2039688	I mean, oh yeah.
2040448	2042449	But that's other people though.
2042870	2044371	This is one hacker they're going after.
2044411	2045952	This is not the whole hacking community.
2046192	2046872	It's one guy.
2047913	2049054	He's not going for piracy.
2049354	2054637	So the fact that they're saying, you know, he's releasing tools to enable piracy.
2056479	2065828	Yeah, in the long run, maybe, but you could say, well, you released a console that enables piracy, because eventually there will be piracy on it.
2065888	2070252	And just think, if they would have just kept Linux on the damn system, maybe people wouldn't have gone here.
2070413	2077439	I'm convinced that most of the hardcore people in the crypto and DRM communities that love breaking that stuff don't even play games.
2078220	2079601	They're like, this is an awesome thing.
2079641	2080962	It's got awesome DRM on it.
2081002	2082903	I want to break it because that's fun as hell.
2083203	2084144	That's fun as hell, yeah.
2084164	2084604	It's funny.
2084644	2091089	They're asking him, Daryl, so what's something... Once this whole PS3 thing is done, what's your next thing?
2091109	2092329	What are you going to move on to next?
2092630	2097693	What's your next... Because he stopped doing the iPhone stuff because he got bored with it.
2098394	2099034	That's all it was.
2099094	2101235	And this guy, he's like 21 years old.
2101255	2103577	Okay, this is a 21-year-old.
2104558	2106799	And so, yeah, he got bored with whatever it was.
2106979	2107520	And he's like,
2108421	2110444	Well, I hear the PSP2's coming out.
2112387	2113809	Let me go to the other comments from chatroom.
2113829	2120460	Chat.orange.com Defective Candy in our chatroom says, Can I put end-user license agreements on other things in life, like the door to my house?
2121730	2121970	Maybe.
2122811	2123152	Let's see.
2123893	2127116	Spazinator PC says, I'd never mess with my system.
2127276	2131341	I'd be too afraid of bricking it, thus losing my video content that I bought.
2131742	2133644	That's kind of where I'm at a little bit.
2134044	2139971	And I really don't have a good reason to hack my system.
2140031	2140792	Me personally.
2141252	2142093	Because I...
2142754	2145416	Don't really want to pirate everything.
2145516	2146117	Like, I don't know.
2146157	2148979	There's limits, and I think that's a bit much.
2149460	2153143	You know, then we won't have games anymore if everybody goes batshit crazy about pirating.
2154104	2157186	But, you know, I don't know.
2157226	2161069	I'd be afraid of some of this other stuff of just, like, screwing my console, especially, like, 360.
2161410	2164052	I have lots of XBLA games I've bought.
2164592	2165613	Thanks for watching!
2180486	2205059	I haven't been into chipping or modding systems since the PS1 and the Dreamcast after that era I stopped doesn't mean I'm not still interested in that community but just as far as the the consoles have just gotten too expensive for me to you know open it up and you know I'm not a whiz with a soldering iron as I once was so I'd probably break the hell out of it but yeah I find these stories really interesting but I haven't been into modding or any of that stuff in a while
2205712	2209114	I would say I would support trying to get around region locking.
2209334	2211316	Like, a comment in chat room made me think about that.
2211396	2215458	Ray Ayanami says, I could have hacked my US 360, then I would have had to get a Japanese one.
2215558	2217279	Or, then I wouldn't have had to get a Japanese one.
2217660	2226845	And that kind of made me think, you know, yeah, getting around region locking, I think, I don't understand region locking, but that's... I do, I understand why they do it.
2226885	2227946	That doesn't mean I support it.
2228646	2230788	I know it's coming up later in the show, we'll get to it, but...
2231968	2237712	Let's not forget, and I know somebody's going to say it if I don't, PS3, of course, is not region locked, so I can't.
2237732	2239994	Yeah, and that's good, though, because it is good.
2240274	2257605	Here's what comes down to it, and I think that when you remove functionality like that, and it's not even necessarily removing it because a lot of the consoles in the past did not have, they weren't region free, but nonetheless, if you remove or do not have features like it being region free, I don't think
2257965	2258586	Thanks for watching!
2274899	2278540	And the PS3, actually, I think that's why it's taken so long.
2278840	2282721	It's because it had Linux enabled on it from the beginning, and it was region-free.
2283102	2284382	Why do you need to hack the system?
2284402	2288903	Because most people are trying to install Homebrew or play stuff from other regions.
2289944	2290504	So it was all there.
2291504	2294325	Well, they didn't remove the region locking, but they removed Linux.
2294625	2300907	And once they removed Linux, people took interest in trying to get that back because people don't like things that are taken away from them.
2302372	2303153	I just want to throw it out there.
2303193	2308019	If the Wii wasn't region locked, we could have totally made President Cat sell more than 100 copies.
2308600	2309100	Just saying.
2310102	2311984	If you remember that whole debacle from like two years ago.
2312024	2313205	Oh, yeah.
2313245	2314086	Two years ago?
2314227	2317250	It's about at least a year and a half, not two years ago.
2317511	2317891	It was a while.
2318792	2326037	Anyhow, if that's it for the hacking stuff, I just wanted to know, I found it interesting that dude was on Attack of the Show and all this stuff.
2326077	2328018	He's become this E-list celebrity now.
2329539	2332461	He's big in the iPhone community.
2332962	2335884	He came up with the jailbreak stuff.
2335904	2336464	That's pretty big.
2337901	2339702	Alright, let me go to some other stories here.
2340502	2343623	Kind of getting into other legal-ish type of things.
2344423	2346504	Although I don't think this is going to end up being a lawsuit.
2346524	2354566	There was this whole back and forth between Capcom Mobile this week and the folks that made Explosion Man, Twisted Pixel.
2355266	2360793	and it has to do with the game Maxplosion which came out for the iPhone which of course was released to iTunes.
2361313	2364037	It's very similar to Explosion Man.
2364097	2367160	Both feature little red demons kind of running around.
2367961	2370925	They're even like similar names doing similar things.
2371746	2376892	Yeah, so Capcom Mobile took a little bit of heat this week for doing that.
2377672	2385261	And so much that the Twisted Pixel programmer Mike Henry on his Twitter account said, "...Maxplosion gameplay video makes me sad.
2385341	2389106	If you're going to outright steal a game, you should at least understand what makes it fun."
2389546	2397190	Another note to this is that Twisted Pixel had actually once met with Capcom about getting them to distribute Explosion Man.
2397450	2401552	Capcom passed, so for them to do something like this was especially insulting.
2402033	2404054	Well, Capcom had to put out some fires of their own.
2404354	2406575	They, of course, were, quote, saddened.
2407195	2409856	Let me tell you how sad in this little statement.
2435509	2436530	We're sorry.
2437451	2438091	We're sorry.
2439132	2450222	I like how it completely dodges the fact, though, that the game is a total, like, you know, I don't want to say ripoff, but heavily influenced by Splosion Man.
2450262	2450983	You know what I mean?
2451043	2451504	I'm sorry.
2451644	2454626	That press release totally dodges that part of it.
2454646	2455167	You know what I mean?
2455587	2460272	Well, Capcom Mobile, they have different employees and they're in a different building than Capcom.
2460972	2464396	They don't ever work with Capcom console people at all.
2464696	2471122	I mean, God, they wouldn't be working with those teams when they poured over their crappy ports of games onto the iPhone or whatever.
2471463	2473705	Thank you for Dead Rising with four zombies in it.
2475707	2478088	So you're telling me that these people have no communication.
2478108	2481329	That's like the whole Coke Zero, Coke thing.
2482089	2486150	I think people are reading a little too much into what TwistedPixel said.
2486570	2490131	Believe it or not, I believe Capcom, what they're saying.
2490471	2495912	I think a lot of times these big companies, especially international companies, tend to work in little silos.
2496412	2502037	and I don't think that the Capcom division said one to another, hey, we got presented this little game.
2502317	2504379	You guys should try to... I don't think that ever happened.
2504680	2506061	Here's what I think did happen.
2506481	2509144	Explosion Man's been out for a good six months now.
2509564	2513768	I think some people in the mobile division played it and said, we want to do a game like this on the iPhone.
2515029	2517031	I honestly don't think it was ever one of those like...
2518151	2520492	Don't make it shadier than it already is shady.
2520592	2521112	You know what I mean?
2521492	2522652	But let's face it, folks.
2523313	2525013	I look at this and I go, this is news?
2525273	2525553	Really?
2525873	2527134	Games ripping each other off?
2527414	2529414	That's been happening forever.
2530134	2531215	And especially on the iPhone.
2531375	2532335	Hello, Gameloft.
2533515	2538817	I mean, ironically enough, Street Fighter 2, how many times was that game ripped off?
2539741	2541122	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2562339	2565721	It's up to the gamers to reject the crap.
2566682	2571545	And if you think that this is a crappy derivative of Splosion Man, don't buy it.
2571645	2575387	Don't support the ripoff and don't buy it.
2576107	2582431	It's cute, I guess, in some ways that Capcom's being called out on this, but I really don't think Capcom's alone in what they're doing.
2582491	2585713	I think every game company out there is guilty of doing it at some point.
2586774	2587574	Name me a company.
2588095	2590096	I'm sure there's a ripoff game they've done at some point.
2592865	2595578	I can't think of any.
2597549	2599491	Anyway, I'm not taking that literally.
2599531	2609319	I'm not trying to profess to be this encyclopedia of games or whatever, but I'm sure most big companies at one point or another have ripped off another game or allowed a game to heavily influence what they're doing.
2610099	2612922	So, and yeah, some comments from our chat room here.
2613382	2615323	DarkTipsia says, great Gianna sisters.
2616304	2621148	Well, you know, that ended up getting pulled from shelves, so that was a little too close.
2621408	2623270	And it's coming out in DS in February.
2623410	2623891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2640672	2648016	Blue Sky, Bricks on the Ground, Goomba Looking Monsters, Bricks that Turn into Coins.
2648096	2651398	I mean, damn, it was really, really just like Mario.
2651458	2653199	Little power-ups that make you get bigger.
2653739	2656361	It really was pretty much a Mario Brothers ripoff.
2656681	2680503	ironically enough when you get into later levels there are some kind of different mechanics that do set the game apart a little bit but here's the thing the reason why people remember that game so fondly it wasn't necessarily the game itself but it had a kick-ass soundtrack like you've ever heard the soundtrack to Great Giana Sisters and a lot of the Commodore 64 music you still hear that influence today I mean bit chiptune bit music all of it is influenced by Commodore 64 stuff all of it
2682550	2707690	and so there was such great music that came out of that Commodore 64 era and Great Gianna Sisters I think is fondly remembered because yeah it was a rip-off of a game it had an awesome soundtrack so uh Dark Titsy also brings up Casey Munchkin which was uh that was an Odyssey game there was a total rip-off of Pac-Man yep uh GameGuru says Capcom even sued for fighters history at that time they lost it's kind of interesting what games are considered too close and what games aren't hmm
2709361	2712847	Actdeft, by the way, in our chatroom says, Loki, I know a guy that works at Gameloft.
2713127	2717775	He pretty much has told some friends and me that they pretty much rip off games and just make some cosmetic changes.
2718376	2723785	Gameloft had a Castlevania Symphony of the Night rip off they were going to release a few years ago, but they canceled it.
2725351	2732579	Here's the thing though, to Gameloft's credit, some of their games are actually pretty good.
2733320	2739686	Granted, they're not the most original thing, but damn, for what it's running on, it's pretty good.
2740507	2741168	Problem is...
2741528	2754480	When they go to develop on consoles, they don't really learn that, okay, I can't put out a... Well, you can put out a Modern Warfare 2 clone, but no one's gonna give a shit because it's on consoles now.
2754520	2758484	It's not as impressive as making it run on the iPhone or whatever.
2758965	2763449	But yeah, their ports, I mean, or whatever, they aren't terrible.
2764450	2766352	I mean, I haven't played all of them, but...
2767792	2773195	They look, compared to some of the Angry Bird clones and stuff like that, it could be a lot worse.
2774015	2780357	Funny enough, if Gameloft had put out a version of Explosion Man, do you think it would have necessitated all these stories on GameBlogs this week?
2780397	2781738	Nope.
2782478	2789541	It was funny, though, because they did have a story that didn't make our show roll, but Gameloft was saying, we don't rip games off.
2789921	2794803	There's just a limited amount of genres that we can use, so a lot of games look similar.
2796684	2803727	No, I'm sorry, that is a bunch of shit Do you know why this, I think, got traction and is all over the news?
2803827	2821436	Because it's Capcom, and they expect better from Capcom Exactly, because Capcom, I think, has always been seen as They're one of us, they're friends with the community They're letting the people design Mega Man Legends 3 They're the good guys I'd expect better from Capcom, the console game manufacturer
2822276	2850282	Capcom Mobile, their stuff is shit that's true, the Mega Man game on iPhone, shit, absolute shit Dead Rising, terrible Devil May Cry I haven't actually played it yet but I'm sorry, it probably won't be good so no, I don't expect much better from Capcom Mobile now Capcom though, if they actually put out an Xbox Live Arcade game of Maxplosion then I'd be a little sad now you're acknowledging that they're separate divisions
2852486	2853226	This is what I'm saying.
2853246	2854707	It's their words.
2854807	2856847	I don't think they're talking to each other.
2856947	2861708	I don't think it's a mass conspiracy, the steel explosion, man.
2862848	2863969	It's not anything like that.
2864209	2869770	It's just they make crappy games in their mobile department.
2869790	2870490	What can I say?
2871690	2872811	All right, let's move on.
2873471	2879272	We'll see who's accusing who of ripping someone off next, and we'll go to another news story from SalaciousPod.
2880809	2889691	Champions Online, which came out in September of 2009, some brief 15-16 months ago, is going free to play.
2890871	2894252	I think Lord of the Rings Online was the most recent major MMO to do this.
2894792	2898953	Champions Online will be going free to play starting January 25th.
2899493	2905414	You can download the client and create your superhero or your villain and go along your crime-fighting way.
2906835	2919851	When it gets relaunched on the 25th, it is getting a new title, Champions Online Free-for-All, which sounds like it might be an expansion, but that's just what they're rebranding it for the free-to-play model.
2920772	2921833	This story is kind of...
2923535	2924636	Thank you for watching.
2924656	2925096	See you next time.
2944973	2959221	and it was going to be the first MMO that had PC and Xbox 360 support where you could have an account I think that worked on both platforms and a month or two before release
2960241	2987896	Microsoft pulled the plug on the Xbox Live component of the MMO so right before they launched they already had potentially 50% of their game base taken away from them it became PC only and it floundered it never really took off, it kind of flopped actually so this isn't surprising to me at all I'm surprised that they're actually going free to play because for me it would seem that now they would be able to bring it to Xbox Live
2988536	2995160	because before they had, for some reason, the infrastructure with MMOs and stuff and subscriptions, they couldn't do it.
2995180	2997682	I'm sorry, but I call bullshit on Microsoft.
2998042	3001764	Final Fantasy XI came out like six months after the Xbox was out.
3001784	3003365	They were able to do this shit for years.
3003385	3005847	Well, then why haven't there been any MMOs on the console yet?
3006027	3007307	That's a damn good question.
3007747	3009248	One I think Microsoft needs to answer.
3009648	3011488	Final Fantasy XI did this shit.
3011588	3014669	It was PC and 360 and PlayStation 2 for fuck's sake.
3014689	3017070	You know why I don't think that there's been any MMOs?
3017110	3020371	Because there haven't really been any MMOs on consoles yet.
3020451	3025852	But now, now with Sony releasing like DC Universe and they're going to have the agency some year.
3027253	3031654	Final Fantasy XIV, which... Well, eventually Final Fantasy XIV, but...
3032594	3035677	You know, if that stuff takes off, though, they're gonna have to compete.
3035757	3047670	But right now, they had the MMO, Sony didn't have anything, and so now, you know, and Final Fantasy XI, I don't think, did too well for them on 360, because, you know... Because it had already been out for...
3047950	3048431	Thanks for watching!
3063994	3086632	it was awesome bought it because we had the PC version but sometimes we wanted to play it on our TV and it did look really good on the TV I'm not gonna lie like if I was still into playing Final Fantasy 11 I'd probably be playing it on the 360 with my current setup at home where I just live by myself now and I could be using my TV as a giant computer like that I would totally be playing Final Fantasy 11 on the Xbox 360 if I was still playing that game
3088237	3113569	it it it you know if that game went free to play yeah I gotta admit if Final Fantasy 11 went free to play I'd go back I'd go back and if all my characters were still there I'd be on like that I would download the client I'd be on tomorrow I would I'm not gonna lie that that's scary that that's a scary thought let's see if they did that bye bye 14 it doesn't even matter don't even release it just forget it it just don't even worry about it just finish keep adding to 11
3114582	3115163	Oh, that's scary.
3141326	3146668	So you knew that when this game came out, it was ready to come out on the Xbox.
3147168	3153230	And even on the PC version, you plug in an Xbox controller, and you can see how much better the game is with an Xbox controller.
3153290	3155031	That's kind of how I feel about DC Universe.
3155171	3159813	Ironically enough, these two games are somewhat similar in the whole superhero in the making thing.
3160853	3166195	I wonder if this happening is somewhat of a response to DC Universe now entering the market.
3167315	3169536	It seems like quite a few people are jumping on board here.
3169996	3176660	and having played the beta test of the PC version of DC Universe, man, it was so much better when I plugged in the controller and did it that way.
3177461	3182144	And so you download the client and you create your free account, you can play.
3183084	3192530	It's adopting sort of a freemium model where if you want to pay for the additional costume packs or the weapons or...
3194051	3221554	Powers or whatever you can pay a la carte for that however if you're into the game enough that you're willing to pay a $14.99 subscription which is what it is right now you will automatically get that stuff as soon as it's available you'll have everything so they're still offering a subscription based service for people that are into the game enough that they want all the goodies or you can just play it you know have it run with your WoW account
3222334	3245335	do the if you see one particular expansion that you like pay for it a la carte and otherwise it's free so yeah hopefully hopefully this will help the game out because I really like the superhero genre and this game I feel never really got a chance to succeed because of what Microsoft did too do you have any speaking of the superhero genre do you have any interest in DC Universe Online now that it's out um
3248678	3255244	I don't know if this is pretentious or what, but just the fact that it's DC, like if Marvel came out with an MMO, I'd feel the same way.
3255784	3257205	I just don't like the big names.
3257425	3267814	Because City of Heroes has a huge RP community in it because it's so customizable and it's not attached to any known license like DC is.
3268094	3270216	But yeah, I'm going to check this out now, now that it's free to play.
3270476	3271557	Champions Online, absolutely.
3271838	3272338	I'm going to get it.
3273126	3273406	All right.
3273486	3275427	Well, you'll have to come back and let us know how it is.
3275667	3275847	Yes.
3276127	3276408	All right.
3277008	3277268	Awesome.
3278548	3278969	Let's move on.
3279349	3280429	Yes.
3280890	3288493	So it's no surprise that one of the best games to be released for the Kinect has sold 1 million units in the U.S.
3288833	3295796	That would be Dance Central and also Kinect Sports, both those games breaking the 1 million unit mark.
3296917	3301739	Of course, the Kinect hardware has sold 8 million units worldwide.
3302539	3321343	and also it's kind of neat to mention and I don't think a lot of people know this yet but in case you haven't picked up Dance Central or you're thinking of picking it up and you may want to wait a little bit because they're actually going to be doing a new SKU that's going to be coming out to the market soon that will give you I guess your first piece of download content for free.
3321383	3326184	It's going to include a code for 240 Microsoft points bundled into the box.
3326624	3327585	Thanks for watching!
3348300	3357510	And it's so funny because last night I was out at the club and they were playing actually a couple songs that I recognize from Dance Central like Evacuate the Dance Floor.
3357871	3361335	So when Evacuate the Dance Floor started playing, I actually kind of started doing this in my seat.
3361775	3363217	Evacuate the dance.
3363257	3366801	I was doing the whole little dance from the game.
3367201	3367882	That's what that was.
3367922	3368763	I just thought you were drunk.
3369043	3369464	I didn't know.
3369984	3370825	I hate that song so much.
3395541	3396763	I know you want me.
3397104	3398526	I know I want you.
3398626	3401210	You know I want you.
3401270	3402471	The routine's pretty fun, though.
3411343	3418751	I know, that's the thing about Dance Central is that as stinking cheesy as those dances are, you kind of start to remember them after you've played the game enough times.
3419031	3421854	And I'm tempted to do it on the dance floor and I feel like a dumbass.
3421874	3423155	That one's really weird.
3423495	3425117	It's like a lot of jumping around.
3428180	3428660	Good times.
3429080	3435322	Alright, something that won't be as easy to dance to and you really, really should not reenact in real life at all.
3436142	3446064	The kind of, I guess you could say the, I don't know, very hard R rated Mortal Kombat episodes that are going to be coming out soon.
3446344	3454246	Okay, you might remember there was this little YouTube clip some time ago that was like a concept video for a Mortal Kombat movie reboot.
3454706	3457467	And it was like, imagine if Mortal Kombat went all Saw.
3458067	3458347	on you.
3458868	3459908	And it was really violent.
3459988	3461289	And some big names were in this.
3461349	3462569	Like, I want to say, what?
3462609	3463310	Michael Jai White.
3463430	3466671	Michael Jai White was Jax, and Tits of Nine, what's her name?
3467752	3468853	Was Sonia.
3470193	3471894	Jerry Ryan was Sonia in this.
3472394	3472855	And, yeah.
3473855	3475276	Sadly, they're not going to make it a movie.
3475616	3476577	That's not happening.
3476617	3479339	But what is going to happen, there's going to be some webisodes.
3479839	3482361	A 10-part Mortal Kombat webisode series.
3482882	3486064	I guess this is somewhat to promote the new games that are coming out.
3486084	3487945	So I wonder if that will somehow work together.
3488346	3490967	Michael Jai White is going to come back as Jax.
3491748	3497132	However, the website Bloody Disgusting that reported on this, because that's a website all about the gore movies, basically.
3497732	3499554	They didn't say a whole lot about the storyline.
3499614	3503617	So I imagine this is all just a part to kind of like pump up the release of the game.
3504017	3505919	But we don't know a whole lot outside of that.
3506039	3507360	So I guess it's neat.
3508341	3509922	I'm not into the uber violence.
3509962	3514026	You see, like I like Mortal Kombat because it's cartoony violence.
3514426	3516448	Like cartoony violence is funny to me.
3517048	3518710	But I don't like the Saw movies.
3518890	3520572	That just crosses the line to me.
3521753	3523855	So I don't know how I feel about this whole thing.
3524135	3526358	Am I a hypocrite?
3527379	3530302	Am I a hypocrite because I like Mortal Kombat but I don't like Saw?
3532464	3532844	A little.
3533185	3533906	Maybe a little bit.
3534026	3534446	I don't know.
3534987	3536068	I haven't really thought about it too much.
3536769	3539530	Spazinator says anyone remember the short lived Mortal Kombat TV show back in the 90s?
3557416	3560317	Yeah, that was an interesting... I remember that show.
3560417	3570379	It was on the network here that is now the CW that used to just show all the... You know, before there was a CW network, they would show all the... UPN!
3570579	3570799	Yeah.
3571139	3572079	No, even before that.
3572579	3575780	Because this show was on, I want to say, in the early... No, I guess it was... It was UPN.
3575820	3577160	It was UPN at the time, that's right.
3577720	3578860	So it was just funny.
3580241	3585902	Anyhow, we'll see what becomes of this Mortal Kombat as we get closer to the game coming out.
3586542	3587843	But for now, we move on with more news.
3589024	3589644	Slash pop.
3591565	3610818	Okay, so Capcom is coming out with a system for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 where if you do the versus online mode and you're playing some stranger and he dunks on you really bad and the only reason why he didn't get a perfect on your ass is because you got in some block damage and you say screw this and quit...
3611778	3623387	Well, you're going to eventually rally up enough rage quit points or whatever that you're going to be thrown into other random battles with other rage quitters to discourage that type of behavior.
3625769	3626690	So yeah, that is...
3628860	3655827	interesting I believe in Tatsunoko versus Capcom for the Wii they have a similar system if you enter a random battle leave in the middle of it because you're losing then once you finally get someone that you can win a round on um they'll rage quit on you and you guys can just all rage quit on each other while the more serious competitors will you know take their random battles more seriously I guess so yeah that's um that story uh came out uh last week and uh
3657389	3658470	Yeah, sounds interesting.
3658791	3659992	I wish they'd do this in WoW.
3660012	3661634	I wish they'd do this in Grand Theft Auto.
3663035	3664517	Does everyone seem to like this idea?
3664637	3666579	What if the rage quitting is beyond your control, though?
3666599	3668742	What if it's like a legit connection failure?
3668802	3675269	If you're out in the boonies and you only have like maybe satellite as your only broadband option, then yeah, that might suck for you.
3676618	3680780	But then again, you're still a problem for the people you're trying to play against.
3681100	3683741	You're still dropping out all the time, so maybe you do need to be paired with the rage quitters.
3683761	3686802	To the person that you're playing against, they don't know that you dropped out.
3686842	3689363	They just think you're a rage quitter anyway, so it's still your problem.
3689403	3701488	Yeah, at our work, we usually have that issue with Grand Theft Auto matches and stuff, but I would think that they would know that I'm not rage quitting because I'm kicking the fucking ass out of them, and I'm in first place, and then I drop.
3701588	3704890	It's not like, oh, damn it, I'm doing too good, I'm leaving.
3707629	3733655	maybe a little bit just a tad let's travel around the world and look at release dates for games that are coming out soon more games that you can rage quit in yes this week is not too busy but it doesn't fucking matter because there's only really one game you should pick up and that would be LittleBigPlanet 2 very excited that this game is coming out and I can dust off my PS3 finally and play this game so it's pretty awesome
3733875	3740658	If you haven't played this game yet too, on PlayStation 3 as well, Mass Effect 2 will be making its way out.
3741038	3748621	And it's slightly polished Mass Effect 3 engine along with all the download content.
3748641	3749421	So that's kind of cool.
3749601	3750802	That will be out this week as well.
3752543	3754566	Um, some other fun stuff coming out this week.
3754606	3758290	Plants vs. Zombies on Nintendo DS, which is a pretty awesome game.
3758871	3761834	Um, Mindjack is actually kind of a neat looking game.
3761874	3764518	This is on PlayStation 3 and 360 from Square Enix.
3765178	3770385	Um, getting some comparisons to Demon's Souls actually, except for the, I don't think it's supposed to be...
3771506	3773707	to the point where you want to blow your brains out hard.
3775709	3783495	But apparently it's one of those games that has a persistent online portion of it where you can jump into other people's games and play as the villains.
3784676	3785176	Nice.
3785617	3786658	I love that idea.
3787038	3790120	So, yeah, that's something that's coming out this week, which is pretty cool.
3790921	3791241	And then...
3794059	3794359	What else?
3794840	3796641	Oh, Spellforce 2 Faith and Destiny.
3796661	3799703	I guess it's a PC title that's coming out this week, as well as Veneticon PC.
3799723	3800844	That was a little bit of a holdover.
3801665	3802065	But that's it.
3802845	3803686	Really, yeah, small week.
3804199	3805880	Demon's Souls 2 Demon's Souls 2 Demon's Souls 2
3831099	3832300	But Mindjack sounds interesting.
3832921	3835363	I'd say I'd check it out, but unfortunately games cost $60.
3836424	3839226	So if I'm not able to rent it first or try it, I don't know.
3839366	3840107	Give it some time.
3840227	3846573	I don't think this is going to be a game that's packed in between LittleBigPlanet 2 and Dead Space 2.
3846853	3851137	A lot of people aren't going to realize that this game is out and they'll probably drop the price rather quick.
3852038	3852378	We'll see.
3853079	3855303	Let's move to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates.
3855343	3862433	We have Connect Joyride coming out on the 360 as well as Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom both come out on the 20th of this month on 360.
3862833	3867180	So they're getting some of their Connect localized titles a little later than we had them here.
3867760	3869261	That also comes out, by the way, on the PlayStation 3.
3869641	3873603	Not Kinect, of course, but Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom comes out from Namco Bandai.
3874583	3881386	This game, I'm trying to think if I've heard of this here in the U.S., and I know I've seen a trailer for this, and it actually looks pretty awesome.
3881446	3882747	Loki, what is this game called here?
3883267	3884267	What?
3884347	3887208	It's from Namco, and it's like Overworld.
3887228	3888989	You have this little giant following you.
3889009	3891030	It's called Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom.
3891410	3892511	Is this called the same game here?
3892531	3894652	Yeah, it came out over the end of November.
3895332	3895492	What?
3895772	3896553	I missed this game?
3896713	3897193	Yes, you did.
3897253	3898994	This looks kind of neat.
3899054	3900235	How well received was it?
3900535	3900875	I don't know.
3901215	3901755	It looks kind of cool.
3901775	3903496	But it dropped in price a bunch of times.
3903536	3903796	Did it?
3904057	3905698	I mean, right before it came out.
3905838	3907218	I think it was only a $40 game.
3907559	3908619	I might have to check that out.
3909500	3911020	So many games came out at the end of last year.
3911040	3911521	I totally missed that.
3911541	3913522	Well, yeah, it was that and Spider House were the same week.
3915323	3917704	People kind of forgot about it because, you know, was it...
3920763	3928929	Operation Black, Black Ops, something like that, yeah, and Assassin something or other, Creed, Brotherhood, yeah.
3930070	3940677	Alright, also coming out on PlayStation 3, this is a price reduction of a game that's already been out, it comes in the best series now, it's Ryu Ga Gotoku 4 Densetsu Wu Sugumono.
3941178	3946842	You might know this game as Yakuza 4, that's the same game there, and that's getting a big price reduction on the PlayStation 3 this week.
3947842	3950984	Going to some other systems like the Nintendo Wii.
3951004	3955226	Nintendo Wii has Sengoku Mosou 3 gets a price reduction this week.
3955726	3962909	And Momotaro Densetsu 2010 Sengoku Isshin no Hiro Dasyugo gets a price.
3963229	3965010	I think that's a price reduction as well this week.
3965050	3967111	So lots and lots of things getting cheaper.
3967511	3968731	And I'm trying to see what this game is.
3968772	3972473	This looks like kind of like a, I guess, train station simulator.
3972533	3974974	These train games are very popular over there in Japan.
3975014	3976435	So it's another train simulator game.
3977315	4005698	That is getting a price reduction there Starting to see some stuff for the 3DS forming in Japan But can't talk about it until February 26th But that's starting to show up on my list So that's kind of exciting But if you want to go back to the regular DS Zombie Daisuke comes out this week As well as yet another price reduction for Gaikuten Kenje comes out Also Plants vs. Zombies I guess comes out in the US this week And that is actually getting some import over in Japan Believe it or not
4006738	4035750	also a huge huge release on the PSP this week Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix so it's like kind of like the game redone with the extra stuff including anything we got here in the US that they didn't get over there one other game on the PSP to mention Venus and Braves Majo to Megami to Horiobi no Yogen comes out from Bandai Namco this week as well so there you go Venus Braves by the way is what that series is known as
4036833	4038024	That's it for Japanese releases.
4038044	4038488	How about the UK?
4039857	4052708	For UK releases, I'm going to take it back a couple days just to remind everybody in the great old Britain that DC Universe Online came out on the 14th on both PC and PlayStation 3.
4053729	4056672	And also a game called Ghost Trick for the DS.
4056752	4058013	That was January 14th.
4058714	4062737	And Kingdom Hearts Recoded as well on the DS on the January 14th.
4063217	4066300	For this upcoming week, we have on the January 17th
4067759	4069821	Monday Night Combat for the PC.
4071563	4082374	On the 21st, we have LittleBigPlanet 2 for the PS3, Mass Effect 2 for the PS3, and MindJack for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4083375	4084896	And that wraps up all of next week.
4085377	4086017	That's on the 21st.
4086658	4115326	You know what's funny about those releases is that I almost pretty much heard the same stuff when Loki was talking and you don't see that a lot is that the UK and the US are kind of getting a lot of releases Usually the UK will get their stuff late Yeah, so that's pretty cool that a lot of the stuff is coming out in tandem so if I were living overseas I'd be pretty happy right now to hear that Alright, well let's move on with a couple more stories and then the classic game of the week I know Dark Sakura is not here tonight but we've got a plan B, don't worry We're going to get to the classic game of the week in just a little bit but first, two more news stories for you guys
4116339	4124182	Yes, unfortunately, the Wii always gets shit on when it comes to download content, and that seems to be what's going on this time.
4124483	4134947	The Rock Band Network, which is releasing a bunch of indie tracks on the Xbox 360, and I believe they were getting a few ported over to the PS3 and Wii.
4135047	4137748	Well, that's going to stop, at least on the Wii.
4138588	4142890	It says, with a smaller install base, limited demand for releases so far, and the submission
4143070	4149051	Significant amount of work it takes for our producers and audio team to convert and process these additional tracks.
4150572	4156113	We are no longer able to continue submitting Rockman Network content to the Wii.
4157033	4161494	So to summarize, or in other words, no one's fucking buying it so we're going to stop making it.
4161754	4161974	Yes.
4162314	4167795	It says regular Wii DLC and Rockman Network releases for the 360 and PS3 will continue uninterrupted.
4169602	4196756	honestly truthfully I think the Wii owners are lucky to be getting any DLC at all like with how crappy Nintendo's online front end is compared to their competitors I am I honestly think Harmonix is graceful and generous in the amount of content that they do put out on the Wii and like I realize that a lot of people own a Wii and a lot of people have this game on the Wii but I think they they more than support their game like better than probably any other fucking company does on the Wii
4197276	4201198	Well, at least on the Wii, though, you get some Rock Band stuff this week on the 18th.
4201519	4216288	You get the main drag, How We Look on Paper, Wounded Soul, RX, Band of Horses, The Great Salt Lake, Firewind, Head Up High, Seton Clausen and the Soul Side, White Heat, and OK Go with White Knuckles.
4216988	4218249	OK Go is pretty awesome.
4222652	4222932	All right.
4225188	4226429	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4248607	4251749	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4274143	4297514	and it looks like the way this works is a lot of the words kind of show up on the bottom of the screen so you can kind of touch them to put the words in and what have you yeah that's basically the deal so I man that's great if I had an iPad I'd be checking that out right now in fact I might try it on my iPhone but I'm guessing it doesn't work nearly as well because you don't have quite the same real estate so there you go
4301103	4302504	I wonder how they're getting away with this.
4302724	4307248	I guess it's just kind of one of those until they get the cease and desist letter, they're just going to do it.
4307348	4309710	Or once it's on the internet, everybody has it.
4309870	4310211	I don't know.
4310851	4312993	SSJ100Matt says, wait for iPad 2.
4313053	4314434	It comes with electric boogaloo.
4314815	4316576	That's from our chatroom, chat.orangeeyesradio.com.
4316916	4320199	I am going to actually wait for iPad 2.
4322021	4326945	I do want to wait for that because it'll have the front-facing cam and all the other frills and stuff.
4327632	4330895	I enjoy whenever we go to the mall and we pass the Apple store.
4331456	4332797	I was like, hey, Rob, go get your iPad.
4333017	4333998	Just impulse buy it right now.
4334439	4335400	Drop the 600 bones.
4335440	4335680	Do it.
4335860	4337041	One of these days, I'm going to do it.
4337081	4338483	And then you're going to be like, I was kidding.
4339724	4341145	I ain't really mean for that to happen.
4342048	4346550	Well, you know, when the iPad 2 is announced, the prices of those iPad 1s are going to plummet.
4346710	4348210	Like, they're going to go down to $200, $300.
4349050	4354152	I have so many friends that work at the Apple mothership down in, where is that?
4355232	4355853	I don't even know.
4355993	4357793	Well, all your friends work there, shouldn't you know?
4359434	4360254	Cupertino.
4360274	4361575	Cupertino, the one infinity loop.
4361675	4365556	And whenever the new generation of iPods come out,
4365876	4369839	within their internal employee store because they get markdowns on that.
4370380	4370920	Dirt cheap.
4370960	4372121	I've gotten two iPods that way.
4372741	4373042	Nice.
4373062	4375523	So I'll try and... Well, except you'll want a new one.
4375543	4377265	No, I want one of the new fancy pants ones.
4377305	4378226	I don't want that old shit.
4378326	4379126	I want the new ones.
4379166	4384751	I can do drunken FaceTime because that's the only reason you use FaceTime is when you're rip-roaring drunk, which I didn't do last night, oddly enough.
4384991	4388473	But anyway, FaceTime is best for drunk dialing.
4388654	4390775	It's drunk dialing for a new century is what it is.
4391616	4393037	So there you go.
4395619	4401365	To answer your question, yes, you can play it on an iPod, but it's hard.
4402126	4402807	Why is it hard?
4403187	4406430	It's small because you have to type in text on the bottom here.
4406690	4407671	Oh, yuck.
4407872	4408692	But you can do it.
4408732	4411155	You can click around and stuff because it supports Safari.
4411555	4412636	Wow, that's pretty cool.
4412917	4414098	I thought I got sucked through.
4414218	4414839	Great, that sucked.
4414959	4415499	Oh, that's too bad.
4416480	4421123	Alright, question from our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com live here on this Sunday evening.
4421443	4423865	Dark Tetsuya says, Rob, are you going to wait for the 3DSi?
4424646	4433492	No, I'm getting the 3DS right when it comes out and I bet a lot of you skeptic folks the first time you see the 3DS you're going to be like, holy shit, it really is 3D without glasses and you'll probably buy it too.
4435112	4459501	I'm really not trying to sound like a fanboy don't get me wrong, Nintendo pisses me off more than they usually make me happy but the 3DS it's a pretty fantastic piece of technology I'm almost excited to get it for and I know this is going to sound weird because I'm usually not a fan of 3D movies but the 3D on the DS doesn't really bother me I'm excited to see what kind of 3D movies come out on the DS if Tron Legacy comes out in 3D on the DS on the 3DS I'm there, hello
4464023	4465324	Seriously, don't you want that?
4467785	4468665	Hell yes, I want that.
4469646	4472887	All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.
4473047	4478350	Here at Orange Lounge Radio, we do a segment every week called the classic game of the week, and it has a little theme song.
4480250	4484913	This is the part of the week where DarkSakura dives into her vault and she drags out a classic video game.
4484933	4485493	She says, hey!
4486485	4486945	DarkSakura.com
4505623	4511044	So we thought maybe Salacious Pop could pick something that DarkSakura maybe would not pick.
4511164	4515485	I made sure that I'm not stepping on DarkSakura's toes on the whole console classic.
4515845	4521546	So I picked a PC classic, namely King's Quest IV, The Perils of Rosella.
4521806	4523487	How appropriate considering the last story.
4523527	4525987	Off of the Sierra Online story we just finished up.
4526247	4527028	Wonderful choice.
4527368	4528848	Let's see if we can get some music here.
4532509	4533230	Thanks for watching!
4553431	4554552	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4570888	4571789	Insert Disk 7.
4571849	4573391	So it was a game like that.
4575212	4588305	I loved this game because it was the last in the King's Quest series that used the traditional text-based input system, like look under bridge, throw ball, search room, all that stuff.
4588805	4593750	King's Quest 5 adopted the new mouse cursor engine.
4594710	4602616	So King's Quest 4, the last traditional text-based King's Quest game, takes place immediately after the events of King's Quest 3.
4603616	4608580	You play Rosella, the daughter of King Gram of Daventry.
4609280	4611902	King Gram in the opening sequence has a heart attack.
4612162	4620648	The magic mirror tells you that you need to be ported away to a magical world, to Tamir, to find this fruit.
4620828	4623050	And if King Gram can eat the fruit, he will not die.
4623770	4625932	and this game had an internal timer.
4626012	4632337	You had to get the fruit and make it back to King Graham within a certain amount of game time or else he would die and it would be game over.
4632457	4634719	So you had to figure out the puzzles relatively quickly.
4635499	4639282	At some point it turned to night and everything got dark.
4639422	4642104	There were certain puzzles that you could only beat.
4642445	4644746	Like there's an abandoned mansion.
4645287	4652112	There was nothing to do there unless you went there at night when it was haunted because the puzzles didn't light up until it was dark.
4652252	4652752	So you had to
4653953	4674465	you know do everything else and then that was the last place you went to while it was still nightfall it had multiple endings it was possible to survive the dangers of Tamir and escape the evil witch Lolote and make it back to King Graham without actually getting the fruit
4675726	4689297	So you had to be able to figure out where it was, what items you needed to get the item and then survive the antagonist, the evil witch, and then give him the food in the end.
4689777	4692920	And yes, it had multiple endings, which was pretty innovative at the time.
4694121	4699685	I think EGA graphics, but the pixels were a lot smaller than the traditional King's Quest games.
4699885	4704729	So visually, even for EGA graphics, 16 color, stunning.
4705029	4713074	and the music, of course, with the King's Quest 4, I believe, was one of the first Sierra games that actually used sound cards instead of just the beep, beep, beep, beep.
4713094	4713955	Good old AdLib.
4714295	4715235	Yep, AdLib.
4715315	4716716	I had an AdLib back in the day.
4716736	4717077	It was the bomb.
4717097	4726782	Because King's Quest, I want to say 1 through 3, or maybe 1 and 2, just used your internal speaker, the loud, harsh beeps, and 4 had sound card support.
4727303	4728323	So, amazing game.
4731086	4739454	Also, like most of the King's Quest games, it was possible to miss an item that you needed to not die or to kill the big bad at the end.
4739874	4747682	If you missed that puzzle, if you let Cupid fly away from the little pool without getting his Cupid's bow and arrow, and you saved your game, you were screwed.
4747842	4748262	Couldn't beat it.
4749043	4749684	Sorry, try again.
4751005	4752687	So yeah, great game.
4753307	4757271	Why is it that so many people think so fondly of 4 specifically?
4757311	4759413	Like, you ask most people, what's your favorite King's Quest game?
4759453	4763317	And most people, including myself, would say 4 was the best, period.
4763758	4766040	Out of a, what, 8-game series, right?
4766500	4767962	Most people would say 4 is the best.
4768462	4770945	I rejected the reality in where it is real.
4771085	4771305	Okay.
4771325	4771305	7.
4771585	4771825	Fine.
4773967	4774267	Fine.
4774327	4777849	Some might argue nine if you count this fan silver lining at this point.
4778189	4785012	But why is it, regardless of how many you think there are or aren't, why is it that four is the one that's so fond and meet people's hearts?
4785333	4789935	I mean, again, I'm sure there's people listening to this show going, no, five was my favorite, or one was the best.
4790535	4791135	Why four?
4791255	4792636	So many people that I know, at least.
4794171	4798893	Visually, at the time, people just never saw a game that was that beautiful on PC gaming.
4799133	4805997	It really took EGA graphics as far as they literally could go without stepping up to VGA 256 colors.
4806837	4813101	So just visually, people just remember how awestruck they were when they saw it and they loaded up the game.
4813121	4815482	When you first arrive on that beach and you can see the wave...
4816583	4819005	of the ocean up against the yellow sand.
4819866	4824090	The sound card support to actually have ad-lib music coming at you through your speakers.
4826112	4831117	And I think the nostalgia of text-based RPGs because it was the last one in that series.
4831177	4833159	King's Quest V and VI were all mouse-based.
4833464	4835706	I think for me, a big part of it too was in the story.
4835746	4840632	It seemed like a lot of it was inspired by fables, Aesop's fables, like Hansel's and Gretel's type of thing.
4840952	4843394	I think that is very fond as well for me.
4843454	4844716	I think that's why I grabbed it.
4844736	4849000	King's Quest has always had that a little bit, but yes, there were a lot of great...
4850061	4877223	meta genre references particularly in 4 the three hags that represent the three fates that all share one eye and you had to catch their eyes so they were blind otherwise they were going to eat you that was in King's Quest 4 you find a gold ball and you throw it into a pond and you have to kiss the frog like the princess and the frog that's in King's Quest 4 so a lot of classic fairy tale homages are in this particular title
4878129	4880291	Man, I really wish this series would come back.
4880331	4883574	And yes, I understand there's the fan project, and I mean no disrespect.
4883594	4889859	They're doing a wonderful, wonderful thing, and they've taken so much shit for what is really a thing that they love.
4890219	4892101	So I'm definitely not slamming that at all.
4892141	4898946	But I really wish somebody would just give people lots of money to make a big-budget return of King's Quest.
4899006	4899547	You know what I mean?
4899907	4900828	How awesome would that be?
4900848	4906633	Well, there have been fanservice VGA or SVGA remakes of the first three.
4907353	4907894	Sure, sure.
4907914	4909895	That are completely independent and they run great.
4909995	4922604	But I mean, just like now with today's technology and games and so forth, with DVD and Blu-ray technology and stuff, I would just love to see a really well-done new King's Quest game that's just, you know, like, I don't know.
4923005	4924165	I don't even know how to explain it.
4924206	4925647	Like, just that whole kind of world.
4925667	4926747	I want to go back to that.
4927708	4928309	Yeah, yeah.
4928329	4928609	Mm-hmm.
4947222	4975076	completely different franchise and story and company but when that game because there was a point in them there was I think a sort of a a shift in what people wanted on PC gaming I think around maybe the early mid 90s where adventure games were boring people didn't like them anymore because Doom came in and PC became about first-person shooters and then Half-Life and all that and the Sierra style of games Space Quest, King's Quest were sort of left in the wake
4975916	4980778	You would think, though, with all the nostalgia wank that happens out there in the world, though, that there would be room for this.
4980818	4986380	And I realize that's kind of where Telltale kind of has their market right now, and they do a very good job at what they do.
4986940	4993463	But I'm just surprised, especially when that whole silver lining stuff was going on, that who owns the license now?
4993583	4997225	Activision, I guess, who got it from Vivendi, has basically said, you know what?
4997265	4998605	We don't want to revisit that world.
4999065	5000766	And that's not just King's Quest.
5000806	5001987	That's Space Quest.
5002127	5003467	That's Hero Quest.
5003767	5004488	Quest for Glory.
5004768	5005388	Quest for Glory.
5005868	5006508	all that stuff.
5006848	5011150	You know, and it's just I don't know, it's just kind of annoying because I would really like to see some of that come back.
5011370	5016051	This is going to sound a little elitist and maybe I'm a bit proud that this is elitist.
5016591	5020253	These games probably too hard for kids these days.
5020633	5021213	They were hard.
5021853	5023554	You could save your game and just screw up.
5023654	5024674	You had to start all the way over.
5025594	5026675	That stuff doesn't fly now.
5027555	5032717	And for it to be a true King's Quest or Space Quest game, it would need to be hard as hell and you would need to be able to
5033957	5035599	Oh, you fail, sorry.
5036120	5043628	You didn't throw the boot at the cat, so now the mouse isn't going to rescue you in King's Quest V, so LOL, 15 hours of your life you have to do over.
5044369	5046031	That won't fly anymore.
5046211	5046571	That's true.
5049154	5050335	Everybody wants the easy button now.
5051436	5061903	Alright, well, if you want to go see how we had it when we were young, you ungrateful kids, go check out King's Quest IV, The Perils of Rosella, because it was just one of the best King's Quest games they ever did.
5062323	5065085	I believe this was ported to a variety of consoles.
5065105	5066066	It's not just PC.
5066166	5072050	I mean, clearly the PC is the best one, but if you must, I believe it was on the NES, wasn't it?
5073243	5073803	Five was.
5074144	5074744	Five was ported.
5074764	5076065	I thought four was on the NES, too.
5076185	5077065	Yeah, five was the one.
5077166	5082249	Also, you can get the King's Quest Collection and Space Quest Collection on Steam.
5082929	5090834	It comes with a DOS box, which is that sort of indie MS-DOS emulator that's fully inclusive of all that stuff that will run on Windows 7.
5092155	5097178	That includes, of course, this game, King's Quest 4, for about $20 on Steam.
5097338	5097618	Nice.
5097719	5099940	For whatever reason, it's never on sale.
5100180	5111428	So I think the licensing for it is very bare bones where Activision is like, here's this DOS box emulated comp of these old ass games and we're not letting you put it on sale ever.
5113369	5116911	Steam never really features it on the RPG page.
5116931	5120253	You have to literally search for it in the Steam client, King's Quest Collection.
5120534	5120914	Good tip.
5121034	5121514	But you can get it.
5121714	5122475	Yeah.
5122515	5126077	If anybody's still using GameTap, I think a lot of those games are on there too.
5126217	5127258	Good old games.
5127478	5128859	GOG might have some of these too.
5129039	5129179	Yeah.
5129560	5129960	Absolutely.
5130400	5134583	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says Westwood also put out the Kyrandia series of adventure games.
5134623	5137045	Just reminded me of another great series that was out there.
5137065	5139167	That was one Loki really liked too, if I remember right, right?
5139207	5143430	Yes, I did like specifically Kyrandia, the Hands of Fate.
5146724	5149405	All right, well, that's going to do it for our classic game of the week.
5149725	5150646	Very good pick, Alan.
5150686	5151286	Very well done.
5152127	5153447	I'm sure DarkSakura would be proud.
5153727	5154708	We'll ask her when she gets back.
5155168	5158530	But we are going to take a quick break, but don't worry, there's plenty more OLR to come.

5302464	5304085	Let's move on to some quick news.
5304826	5306907	We'll get to Twitter topics in just a minute.
5306967	5311890	Last call for some Twitter topics at Twitter.com slash OLR while we do some rapid fire news.
5313185	5331031	As part of that whole Mega Man Legends 3 meta thing that they have going on where basically the fans get to decide different aspects of Mega Man, well it came down to voice actresses or actors for the Mega Man role.
5331771	5357928	and it was up to the vote of fans and 3,000 people voted and it looks like that your Mega Man voice actress is going to be Akimi Kondra and I guess she was the voice actress that did work in Mega Man X Command Mission, Mega Man Powered Up and I guess she's also done work in Persona 4, Fatal Frame 2 and Clannad and
5359269	5359850	That's pretty cool.
5361191	5363593	I guess Mega Man Legends 3 is heading to the 3DS.
5364374	5366476	Another reason to own a 3DS.
5367457	5368738	Fucking Mega Man Legends.
5368878	5369599	That's what it is.
5372594	5381018	The Dreamcast Collection, something that's been rumored for a while, is actually coming out on PC and Xbox 360 this February.
5382058	5384119	I gotta admit, though, it's not too exciting.
5384199	5397766	It's really just a collection of the titles that are coming on Xbox Live Arcade, including Crazy Taxi, Sonic Adventure, Sega Bass Fishing, and Space Channel 5 Part 2, all with slightly enhanced up-res graphics.
5400323	5401764	Um, apparently it's going to retail for $30.
5402445	5405388	And it'll be out on February 22nd.
5407951	5408271	I don't know.
5408471	5412435	Is that something that you'd be interested in, Rob, since, you know, it does have Space Channel 5?
5413096	5413596	Of course.
5413676	5414778	I hella want Space Channel 5.
5414938	5417160	But this is the thing, though, is I wouldn't buy the collection.
5417320	5420964	I'd just buy Space Channel 5 when it comes out, you know, on Xbox Live Arcade.
5421345	5422726	Yeah, that's what made my ears perk up.
5422946	5423526	I was like, what?
5424006	5424767	Ooh la la, what?
5425527	5428328	Because Sonic Adventure, I heard that port wasn't very good.
5428368	5430770	Crazy Taxis, missing a lot of the license stuff in there.
5430790	5431910	Sonic Adventure just wasn't very good.
5432230	5434651	So, you can port it all you want.
5434711	5437153	And Sega Bass Fishing, I just don't give a shit about that.
5437253	5440254	So, you know.
5441555	5443015	And this is a juicy rumor here.
5443095	5445737	Apparently, you know, the...
5447574	5449215	Oh, actually, I'm jumping ahead here.
5449275	5449955	You are a little bit.
5450015	5450436	That's alright.
5450476	5452277	Sorry, must have missed the link there.
5452977	5454538	Now, this is actually a juicy rumor.
5454638	5456880	It's actually coming in the form of Slurpees.
5458280	5471048	They're going to be doing some sort of promotion now with LittleBigPlanet 2 and Killzone 3, where you can go buy Slurpees at your local 7-Eleven, and you'll be able to get different, I guess...
5472589	5476811	prizes or codes that you can redeem for things.
5477191	5481694	They're going to have strategy guides, premium themes, download content, and more.
5483415	5487317	No word if they're going to actually have any sort of special flavors to go along with them.
5488397	5492840	I almost wanted to stop at 7-11 on the way here because it's like, ooh, Slurpee.
5493820	5494761	That's good stuff.
5498559	5501741	Alright, Slurpees are amazing, but lots of calories.
5502202	5507346	So for those of you that are trying to do diets for the new year, I'd stay away from Slurpees, just saying.
5508406	5509307	But they're really good.
5509567	5510588	I love the pina colada ones.
5510945	5512587	Yeah, I was just about to bring that up.
5513127	5513728	So gross.
5514649	5516891	He'll get the large slurpee of the flavor.
5517271	5518412	I think coconut is vile.
5518853	5522916	So he will get the pina colada to guarantee that I won't try to, you know, Bogart it from him.
5523016	5523717	I love coconut.
5523737	5526320	Like, I love my croons are like my favorite cookie ever.
5526460	5528942	And then coconut cream pie is so amazing.
5529102	5529743	Oh my gosh.
5531384	5533026	What have I been eating the last two weeks?
5552040	5554122	French onion soup How dare I How dare I
5577060	5584664	I don't know what it is, but A&W from an A&W or even the combination KFC A&W like they have out here is so much better than the ones at the store.
5584944	5585605	I can't explain it.
5585725	5587406	A&W from the tap is so much better.
5587946	5589527	They sell them in gallon jugs.
5590107	5591148	I swear to God.
5591368	5593989	Today I was like, I could drink a half gallon.
5594089	5594790	I could do it.
5596152	5596812	I've seen them!
5597372	5602794	And they are seriously... It's a sight to behold, I tell ya, man.
5603334	5605635	I took Salacious Pop to Panera for the first time today, though.
5605855	5606555	He really liked it.
5606915	5608275	I guess they don't have them in his neck of the woods.
5608995	5609636	Kind of a new thing.
5609956	5615257	People on Facebook have said that there's a bunch around me, but in the neighborhood I'm in, there aren't any.
5615837	5620418	But yeah, I've never seen one, so... What's ironic is it took... It was hella good.
5620458	5621939	It took the place of a Krispy Kreme.
5621959	5622519	Yeah.
5622879	5625443	I know, and that is crime right there.
5625883	5629688	Really, they should have just, I don't know, they should have tore down another restaurant.
5629788	5631110	It's like, get rid of the Wendy's.
5631371	5633814	Wendy's sucks in everything.
5634214	5636357	All right, let's get back to gaming news.
5636477	5637819	Yet again, the food topic.
5637839	5639001	I don't even know what to say.
5639441	5641743	We have a release date for PlayStation Move Heroes.
5641803	5643204	It's March 22nd.
5644045	5647667	Some bonuses that come with the reservations depending on where you reserve it.
5648408	5656574	Amazon and GameStop, you can get a skin pack with Pirate Sly, Freedom League Jack, and Trillium Armor Ratchet is all the special stuff you can get there.
5657635	5662519	Apparently, quote, there's also a full story surrounding the game and why they're all together.
5662599	5666262	That is from Christian Cardona, the marketing manager of the game.
5666602	5668063	PlayStation Move Heroes.
5669284	5671106	I have yet to buy a PlayStation Move, I don't know.
5671847	5674930	Super Street Fighter 4 3D is coming out, of course, on the 3DS.
5674970	5676893	It's going to have online multiplayer.
5677173	5677834	That's pretty neat.
5678054	5681678	There was a whole little trailer, too, that hit the internet this week that was showing some of the features like that.
5682018	5686003	But there's also going to be worldwide online play and what's called Channel Live.
5686743	5690568	You can just watch live matches in Channel Live if you want to watch the pros do their thing.
5690968	5695192	There's also figurine collecting and random street fighting modes if you want to do that.
5695732	5698555	That's that whole using the aware thing as you walk by people.
5698615	5702759	I guess your character can fight somebody else even though you're not actually fighting.
5703219	5707503	So this sounds like it's going to be a pretty big launch title even though most of us have already played Super Street Fighter 4.
5707963	5711246	My question is, and maybe this has already been answered somewhere, I just haven't seen it.
5711827	5714730	How has the character roster been affected by the move to the 3DS?
5714770	5716851	I mean, surely they had to cut some characters out, right?
5716871	5717332	Yeah.
5717792	5733822	or did they not wow the videos and the YouTubes that have been out of this game have blown my mind on how good it looks so for it to look that good if they cut a few characters in order for that to happen I do not mind because that is some awesome stuff coming out on that game right now
5734932	5735432	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5759567	5761549	Can I go on the tangent train a little bit?
5761689	5762050	Of course.
5763451	5776066	I really hope that this generation of handhelds, be it the 3DS or the PSP2, uses more of the infrastructure, central server style of multiplayer.
5776566	5778188	Because the last few...
5779349	5804664	generations obviously you've got the Game Boy Advance with the link up cable that was the last generation that used that with the PSP and the DS it's all ad hoc I don't know that many people that have a DS or PSP where I can be in the same room with them and do ad hoc connect so I really want this generation Super Street Fighter 4 3DS to have the central server and I know with the PS3 and the PSP you can do the tethering but that's still just too cumbersome for me so I'm hoping that
5805379	5806860	It's too much of a pain in the ass, I agree.
5806940	5811763	So I love handhelds, but I'll never play ad hoc support because I don't know that many friends with them.
5811964	5812384	So that's all.
5813024	5813605	No problem.
5814005	5817567	Let's talk about another fighting game on the 3DS, Dead or Alive Dimensions.
5817707	5822611	It's kind of interesting because they've talked about this game's going to have 30 frames a second and 60 frames a second.
5823011	5826133	It just depends on if you're playing 3D or 2D.
5827014	5830296	So if you're playing in 3D mode, you only get 30 frames a second per eye.
5830616	5834379	But if you decide to condense it down to 2D, you'll get a 60 frames a second fighter.
5834659	5835460	That's kind of interesting.
5836040	5842847	I mean, it makes sense too because obviously 3D is rendering one frame and then another really fast back and forth in rapid succession.
5843348	5849434	I think it'll still look pretty good in 3D, but that's pretty cool that if you get sick of 3D, there's kind of like a little perk, if you will, to play in 2D.
5849934	5850375	Kind of neat.
5850495	5851356	Well, that's the same thing with...
5852897	5854318	I'm sure a lot of games are like that, by the way.
5854338	5862045	Yeah, same with Street Fighter 4 on there, because they have that really funky view that you can do that gives it more depth, but if you don't want to do that, you don't have to do that, which is great.
5862945	5863226	Alright.
5864507	5867289	Salacious Pop has a few stories for us, then we're going to get to the Twitter topics.
5867689	5875516	Real quick, though, I was just going to say, now, I've noticed, and I think this is kind of smart in Nintendo's part, at least, I don't know if it's Nintendo's part, but
5876336	5880919	as far as the games that are coming out launched for it and stuff.
5881199	5883020	It seems to be quite a variety.
5883060	5888544	It's not all like, oh, it's Mario this or Zelda this and all kiddie stuff.
5888724	5891785	It's like we've got some hardcore fighters in there.
5891845	5898529	We've got a little bit of the Nintendogs kind of crap and a little bit of something for everybody.
5899670	5901171	So I think that's pretty awesome.
5904295	5904736	Indeed.
5905236	5910183	It sounds like it's going to have a pretty good lineup at the beginning, so I just hope the price is reasonable.
5910223	5911544	We'll see pretty soon, though.
5913387	5914348	All right, SalaciousPop.
5915862	5930009	Okay, for my quickfire stories, those of you who wanted to play Pac-Man Battle Royale, the return to form Pac-Man arcade game multiplayer, that is now available to American arcade distributors.
5930329	5936913	So that means that whatever arcade, if you're fortunate enough to live in an area that still has one, they can have it.
5937033	5943516	It's a cocktail style cabinet, you know, the old pizza parlor model, set your drink on it.
5944376	5945657	So it's the flat glass cabinet.
5945737	5947858	Coming soon to Dave & Buster's everywhere, I'm sure.
5947938	5949579	Yeah.
5949680	5971934	According to the source of the article, Arcade Heroes, it's currently being sold for $4,275 to the arcade businesses that might want to get it and put it in the store or in their arcade, which apparently is cheaper than most of the other stuff because most arcade games right now that are popular are the ticket spitters.
5972974	5977277	and the big, you know, the time crisis, the huge shoot-em-up arcade games.
5977818	5986604	So, you know, the Pac-Man Battle Royale Cocktail Cabinet, a little over four grand, I guess, is a steal for a new arcade machine.
5987104	5993969	So yeah, Pac-Man fans, look for that in your arcade, starting hopefully as soon as this month, because it's out there for us to buy it.
5994189	5995911	So, next...
5998192	6005638	The domain name FinalFantasy13-2Game.com has been registered by Squeenix.
6006458	6009821	So everyone's all, you know, freaking out about what this means.
6009901	6014704	Maybe Lightning is going to become a pop singer, just like, what's her name in Final Fantasy?
6014764	6016065	Yay, AddressSphere, I can't wait.
6016105	6016506	Yay.
6017567	6024552	So yeah, that was registered along with a bunch of other domains for their, I'm going to totally butcher this pronunciation,
6025372	6027734	N.I.E.R., Nier, that RPG they put out.
6027814	6028655	Yeah, Nier or whatever.
6028715	6029976	Nier and Mindjack.
6030617	6033299	So a bunch of domains are registered for those properties.
6034220	6041306	Square is holding a first production party premiere event in Japan in two days on the 18th.
6041866	6047671	So people are like, ooh, what titles and little side story projects are they going to announce today?
6047811	6049892	Maybe we'll find out about Kingdom Hearts 3
6076920	6100542	maybe maybe we'll find out that would be a great E3 announcement though Final Fantasy 7 remake maybe I'm just flame baiting at this point maybe we'll find out about Final Fantasy 14 redo over the do over expansion they said they were doing Final Fantasy 6 on the DS the 3DS then I would I would that'd be enough for me
6101403	6105267	Square is having some event in two days and they registered 13-2 game.
6105327	6110192	FinalFantasy13.com Speculate to your heart's content.
6112194	6121743	Last quick fire story for me is that some of the retail marketing assets for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 have Akuma.
6122384	6122945	Akuma, Akuma, Akuma
6141607	6143328	Jeez, do we have the full roster yet?
6143348	6146590	Because it seems like every week there's some damn story about, oh, this character's in it.
6146750	6147690	Oh, this character's in it.
6148290	6154794	Well, in this little sample graphic here, it's got Akuma, Tron Bon, which we already knew about, Albert Wesker.
6155274	6156234	I don't know if I knew about him.
6157495	6158696	Yeah, he was announced a while ago.
6158956	6160837	And then Arthur, of course, from Ghosts and Goblins.
6161217	6163478	He was announced a while ago.
6163498	6163718	So, yeah.
6163738	6167820	So, we know that Akuma is at least in print material for the game.
6167880	6170482	So, he's got to be... Maybe he's unlockable, but he's in there.
6171082	6171222	So...
6171602	6172762	Alright, we'll see.
6173502	6175823	Alright, for now, let's go to the Twitter.
6176003	6177263	We're going to get some tweets.
6178143	6182004	Every week we ask you guys to show us your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
6182444	6185105	And we're going to read some messages sent to us right now.
6185905	6188806	We'll start off with Spassinator PSN sent us a couple tweets here.
6188986	6193227	There's been a ton of free stuff put onto the PSN video store lately.
6193687	6196247	The usual spot, so be sure to check it out.
6196847	6198668	So if you like free videos, you can check that out.
6199548	6228672	hopefully your console doesn't get forked if you try to hack it and then you'll lose that rights to all that video content so be careful Redertainment I like this tweet which console would compete better on Jeopardy the 360 the PS3 or the Wii because you know if you haven't heard there's that whole computer that's going on Jeopardy that's supposed to be doing battle against what like Ken Jennings and I don't know somebody else whatever so I don't know what do you guys think which console would compete best on Jeopardy
6230249	6236252	I would guess the PlayStation 3 because of, you know, that whole Uber chip that's inside it.
6236332	6240533	It's kind of got the best computer parts, if you will.
6240834	6244935	Well, the 360 would call Alex Trebek a fag and then the panel boat would go red.
6245816	6246576	The right on screen.
6246956	6250618	It would go red and then it would just sit there for the rest of the show.
6251018	6253459	And Alex Trebek would be like... So, yeah.
6255347	6259970	Actdeft sends us a link to a story about a video game pirate trades sales for Steam.
6259990	6262631	It's a link to a story on Kotaku.
6271776	6272097	and so forth.
6272117	6272337	And, um...
6287917	6292021	He said near the end of 2010 he had stopped playing PC games altogether.
6292421	6295044	And if he ended up liking a game, he wouldn't even bother to order it.
6295084	6297466	He'd just keep playing it until he beat it and then move on.
6298487	6300169	Then Steam, I guess, changed his mind.
6300229	6302271	He's been a user on Steam for five years.
6302931	6308377	and then he would I guess wake up during the holiday sale and see what games he's going to buy.
6309057	6312761	Having the convenience of Steam to download games right there was enough for him.
6312801	6315123	He bought 22 games over the course of the sale.
6315964	6316425	There you go.
6316805	6321250	I guess the 3DS too is something else that's making him reform.
6321330	6322891	You can read the whole piece there on Kotaku.
6324132	6331898	Another link sent to us on Twitter from SJ100 Matt says this is a link about a group of fans remaking Sonic 2 in HD.
6332358	6343787	This is yet another one of those things where I remember one of these not that long ago there was a story about a Sonic game that was being like remade or like a whole new HD Sonic game that looked better than Sonic 4.
6344227	6348951	I think Jamie had the story and she was reporting on it and it looked better than what Sega's putting out.
6349611	6354755	and now there's this whole little teaser on YouTube I guess for a remade Sonic 2 in HD.
6355155	6359819	Now it just looks like old school Sonic but in widescreen and high def.
6359879	6360559	It looks great.
6361940	6363581	Why the fuck isn't this on Xbox Live?
6367342	6367743	I can't.
6369025	6371488	I love how all the fans try to one-up Sega, though.
6372850	6375333	It's like, at what point does flattery become insult?
6376695	6378297	Like, seriously, I don't even know.
6378737	6380280	Defective Candy sends us a tweet.
6380680	6384145	The first kinetic app has shown up in the Mac App Store.
6384565	6394652	It's called the Connect 3D Viewer app, and you can plug the USB Connect into your Mac, and you get a 3D visualization of the depth data.
6394972	6398174	You can also map RGB values on the image.
6398494	6400676	You can zoom and rotate the visualization.
6401036	6405659	So it kind of looks like an old-school Max Headroom thing from the 80s in this little clip you see there.
6405719	6410482	But yeah, now that the Mac App Store is open, people are putting all sorts of creative things up on there.
6410542	6410923	So yeah.
6411423	6412304	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6431802	6433044	PS3 Unlocker
6449845	6469134	so uh wow that that sucks actually for Sony if that happens because there's just gonna be so many people that abuse that and well it's too bad they could easily ban those people that do that they do that for Xbox live right now because you can do that already with JTAG consoles but I mean
6470614	6471295	You can tell.
6472416	6472996	Usually you can tell.
6473256	6476959	Hey, he has a 2 million gamer score.
6476979	6479840	That's a little weird.
6479860	6480761	Probably a little high.
6481161	6486325	I enjoy metagaming and the whole sort of semi-EP achievement point thing.
6486685	6488206	WoW has it, Xbox has it.
6488566	6498653	I think it's neat, but I just can't imagine who is taking this seriously enough to where they want to hack themselves up into the 50,000 score so they can go, hey, look at my gamer card, look at my score.
6499493	6500174	Who is that person?
6500214	6502335	Because I want to meet them and maybe push them down some stairs.
6504095	6506436	Yeah, I mean, it's like, you know, big fucking deal.
6506516	6509798	Like, woo, you unlocked everything and you did it by cheating.
6509858	6511459	You know, it's unfortunate.
6511859	6513660	You know, someone who does it legitimately...
6514740	6524247	Get some really cool achievements, but you know, the person who unlocks the most, the maximum achievements in one game isn't good at every single game, and that's okay.
6524667	6531692	It's just like in the Olympics, the same competitors don't do every single sport, unless you're looking at something like the decathlon, but that's different.
6531832	6558373	and XBLA will occasionally feature a gamer on Xbox Live that has a really high number sometimes it'll be you know an Iraqi vet that's now disabled and they play Xbox and now they have like a 30,000 XBLA score and that's interesting to find out about the people that have numbers that high because they just they play that much and a hack like this kind of takes away from the few people that you know yeah have made a name for themselves out of metagaming so yeah
6558593	6560893	So stop being a dick, basically, folks.
6561033	6564794	This is just a dick thing to do, is to unlock all the trophies that you didn't earn.
6565294	6565554	Dick.
6566275	6568235	Alright, moving on to another tweet.
6568255	6570095	The last tweet tonight, also from Tigerclaw.
6570655	6573356	A Bulletstorm demo, I guess, is going on there.
6573776	6576757	Epic Games has an upcoming first-person shooter called Bulletstorm.
6577857	6583898	I guess the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network demo is coming out on January 25th, if you want to check this out and see if this is the game for you.
6584638	6588119	DarkSakura on Twitter tweets us saying, Why are you so hot?
6615063	6615303	Outro Music
6640570	6645837	But I think you're doing a fabulous job, SalaciousPop, so you would make DarkSakura very proud.
6646478	6652726	Yeah, I want to do this last story before... All right, well, let's hurry up and get there, because we're through Twitter topics, so we got a couple more stories here.
6653287	6653868	We'll go to Loki.
6653888	6653968	Loki.
6656469	6664453	Yes, so we were talking a little bit about the 3DS and stuff and of course not all the news is great.
6666494	6677200	They're going to be first off region locking the console which is not a huge surprise because the DSi, at least the DSiWare part was actually region locked.
6677820	6706341	um, but now they've kind of gone against what they've been doing with the NDS and stuff, and they're just locking the console which, as I said before in our first story, um you're just giving the hackers another excuse to try to, you know crack your system, cause now instead of like, oh I want to install Linux on it, now they're like, well I want to play games for other regions, so I'm gonna hack this and this is gonna be my justification for doing that, so I don't know, it sucks um
6707890	6716440	It says, it looks like, for example, if you play a Korean 3DS game with a Japanese 3DS system, or vice versa, you won't be able to play it at all.
6717021	6719965	Nintendo hasn't actually responded to the comment about it.
6723809	6747004	but they haven't really said it says there's no region codes in DS and DS Lite but the DSi, DSi XL, and 3DS have region codes region codes are installed to each game and the 3DS itself you can't play if the region codes are different so that's kind of lame um region locking sucks I hate it
6749497	6755927	it's what drove me to piracy on the PS1 was wanting to play import Japanese games and I couldn't do it just being honest
6756417	6763719	Yeah, and then of course they're talking about being a little bit more consistent with their first party releases for the 3DS.
6765440	6773962	They were saying that with the Nintendo DS right now, they're not having, I don't know, I think they're doing pretty good with the titles that they have coming out.
6773982	6781505	They have about one or two titles a month from, actually Nintendo, or maybe it's like one or two titles every few months.
6782385	6798860	Um, cause I know, let's see, uh, Dragon Quest is being published by Nintendo, and then Pokemon Black and White, and then they've got, um, I guess they didn't have a first party Wii title for January, but they do have Mario Sports Mix for February.
6799981	6800181	Hmm.
6800201	6800261	Hmm.
6800871	6806977	But they're saying that they're going to be working to have a more consistent release schedule for games.
6808198	6809700	So maybe something like once a month.
6810501	6813083	And that's kind of cool.
6813103	6822633	And they're also targeting other regions as well, developing countries in addition to its current territories to bring the new console to.
6822673	6823053	So that's...
6825481	6828407	That's good for people that haven't had a lot of console games.
6828467	6832755	Maybe Brazil or South America.
6832795	6836703	I know there's some places down there that could use some new consoles.
6839167	6859274	I'm excited to hear that they might have more of a kind of constant stream of games because yeah it seemed like with the DS it was like especially right after launch like I seem to remember a lot of games didn't come out almost for like a year for the DS after the launch yeah but here's my thing though is you know are we gonna actually get new games or is this gonna be like
6859855	6860816	Oh yeah, and we're porting this.
6861456	6862237	Oh yeah, we're porting this.
6884091	6886353	And I gotta admit, okay, how sad is this, you guys?
6887393	6888714	I don't even want to admit this.
6889315	6891116	I kinda want the Nintendogs plus cats.
6891416	6892256	And I don't know why.
6892757	6892857	No.
6893197	6893838	No, I do know why.
6893898	6894458	I want the cats.
6894738	6896759	I'm not gonna buy all three versions like Loki does.
6896799	6897120	No way.
6897440	6901723	No, I'm not doing that either, because I learned my lesson the hard way.
6901743	6903204	You're not even gonna buy one version this time.
6903304	6904164	I'm not buying one.
6905325	6908606	Well, this would make a lot of people even more excited about the 3DS.
6908646	6911507	Like, I really wish they would do this, and I don't know why.
6912147	6912687	Let me explain.
6913067	6913427	Here it is.
6913528	6918489	Nintendo did an interview with Satoru Iwata called the Iwata Asks interview.
6918909	6922510	Iwata-san also wants to include 3D video in the future.
6922830	6924011	That's what Miyamoto had said.
6924771	6930073	Iwata said, quote, I think it would be fun if we were able to include video recording capabilities with future updates.
6930533	6933454	That means it's not going to be there on release, but perhaps in the future.
6934214	6934334	Um...
6935514	6935954	Why?
6936295	6936855	Why not?
6936935	6937575	Let's do it.
6937695	6942598	I mean, I realize that 3D videos, you can't watch them a whole lot of places except maybe, oh, your 3DS.
6943098	6944278	But I don't know.
6944338	6947860	I think that would be kind of cool, like in a way, being able to make your own 3D videos.
6947900	6950521	Of course, give it five seconds and there will be a porno.
6951002	6953683	Give it five seconds and there will be a porno on the 3DS.
6954023	6957285	But can you imagine if you could do like video sharing through 3DS?
6957745	6959766	Like if Nintendo was smart...
6961448	6981703	They would introduce this whole social network file sharing ability Like a portal where you could share videos with your friends That you make on the 3DS Like my trip to Disneyland They could have a 3D YouTube They could have it if they wanted it Do you realize how big that is?
6981803	6987988	With 3D being all the rage and stuff right now But they don't want it But they won't Because they are so bullheaded
6989850	6993251	If Nintendo was smart, they would make 3D YouTube before YouTube can, but they won't.
6993271	6995752	Actually, I think YouTube already has 3D YouTube.
6997373	7002775	But the thing is, the difference is, most computers yet aren't set up to do 3D.
7002835	7006937	The 3DS, it's a camera and it's the viewer all in one.
7007417	7012679	It's... But no, they won't do it.
7013299	7014000	Yes, I'm mad.
7014020	7016821	Because Nintendo just...
7017403	7018304	They're hard-headed.
7018344	7019564	That's what my dad would say.
7019664	7020225	Hard-headed.
7020645	7021626	Nintendo's hard-headed.
7022626	7027349	By the way, there was also talk about the whole StreetPass feature as used in Nintendogs plus Cats.
7027790	7028990	That was from Hideki Kono.
7029391	7029611	Quote,
7039477	7044300	That's supposed to be like when people actually meet in, you know, the park, walking their dogs and what have you.
7044340	7047142	Although, I've never given another dog walker a gift.
7047222	7047843	I don't know about you.
7048523	7050305	But anyway, that's supposed to be a feature.
7050365	7050785	But I don't know.
7050805	7054087	I hear about this shit and I go, isn't that what the DS was supposed to do?
7054768	7057229	Like, wasn't your DS supposed to have that always aware thing?
7057269	7060211	Like, what's so special about what the 3DS is doing?
7060271	7063253	Do you have to hold the 3DSs in a certain way so they can sniff each other's butts?
7064794	7065435	Is that a feature?
7065495	7065815	Maybe.
7065935	7066416	I don't know.
7066436	7066896	Okay, sorry.
7066916	7066996	Okay.
7067136	7070299	Here's what it is to answer your question there, Rob.
7070639	7075804	Remember before, you had to have a certain game in there and it would be in that mode or whatever.
7075844	7082851	So you had to have Nintendogs in your system and they had to have Nintendogs and it would detect that.
7083231	7097771	this will pick up anything regardless of what game it is so say for example I have Mario Kart and Nintendogs and someone else has Mario Kart and Nintendogs but they're playing like Street Fighter 4 or something like that it'll still tag my system with all their other crap
7098692	7101773	There's some clarifications from our chatroom at chat.orangeontradio.com.
7101793	7104933	TigerClaw is clarifying the 3D YouTube videos are the red and blue.
7105313	7108734	If you have the red and blue glasses, you can watch some 3D videos on YouTube.
7109834	7112174	Yes, they have that, but there's also the other ones, too.
7112214	7113915	They do have multiple versions of 3D.
7114255	7119556	I think there's people making self-made 3D stuff right now, but it's just very limited.
7120596	7122256	Zam in our chatroom says, Nintendo?
7122316	7122696	Smart?
7122756	7124397	That's like PS3 unhackable.
7126117	7126837	I see what you did there.
7129216	7131671	Alright, Salacious Pop, what do you have for us?
7133101	7162297	I'm not sure why you put this particular story in the news feed it's amazing because I used to work in adult entertainment and I'm sure if Jamie got this story she would just be flustered and annoyed but a company named Ddub Software is putting out a porno triple X rated indie game called Bonecraft based off of Blizzard's World of Warcraft lore where it's like inspired by but obviously it's close enough to where they can't I guess get sued
7163197	7189427	but yeah so Ddub Software who also put out games I'm trying to find Bone Town Bone Town is another game of theirs and the Tiger Woods sex game I guess plot summary somewhere in the galaxy there's Orcs and Elves this isn't a direct quote I'm just paraphrasing it because otherwise it would be too long Orcs and Elves running around Space Marines crash land on the planet and I guess there's something about Secret Elf
7191508	7195850	and I'm sure you move your mouse up and down to do the sex and I don't even know what this is.
7196150	7196571	What is this?
7196631	7197151	I don't even.
7197791	7204575	But yeah, Bonecraft, the Blizzard sort of StarCraft Warcraft genre.
7204955	7205456	Porno game.
7205876	7210278	I love that it's combining Warcraft and StarCraft together in its parody.
7210919	7212520	Yeah, so for those that want to...
7214195	7217836	D-dub software and the game is Bonecraft An actual video game and not just a porno
7230549	7239919	It kind of reminds me of 30 Rock, Season 3, when Tracy Jordan was going to quit television to make the most amazing porn computer game of all time.
7239939	7241140	I don't know if anyone watches 30 Rock.
7241320	7241941	Maybe this is it.
7242001	7244704	Yeah, this is what I'm thinking it is.
7244984	7246566	We should get the creators of this on the show.
7246786	7251611	Let's totally take them seriously and just be like, so tell us about the plot of your game.
7251731	7253133	How do you envision your hero?
7257335	7258296	Come on, you know you want it.
7258396	7260397	Episode 400, Interview with Bonecraft.
7260417	7260877	Yes or no?
7261458	7261938	What do you think?
7262598	7263319	I think we should.
7264380	7265760	That's going to be the drunk show.
7266001	7268522	What would you ask the creators of Bonecraft, Loki?
7269543	7270083	I don't know.
7270143	7273125	I'd have to learn more about their title, I guess.
7274186	7275987	Well, the title is Bonecraft.
7276207	7278689	I understand that, but what the hell's the game?
7278769	7284412	I mean, Bone Town is just some really crappy avatar game where people talk dirty to each other.
7284452	7286874	I mean, that doesn't tell me anything.
7288138	7293724	Alright, let's get to some more stories and then the mailbag and the FUs of the week are all coming right up.
7294605	7298088	I mean, seriously, what is Bonecraft?
7298909	7301031	What is it?
7302312	7303634	Alright, so, you know,
7304994	7316846	PSP2 will be unveiled this month in Tokyo at a Sony business meeting.
7317266	7321870	It has been confirmed that such a meeting is being held in Tokyo on January 27th.
7322211	7324853	This was confirmed by Sony themselves.
7325194	7328177	Of course they say they can't comment on anything at this time.
7328997	7349815	which probably means that yes they are going to be announcing it at that time so that's cool so if they announce it this year I'm assuming it will probably be coming out this year it'll probably be at E3 so I guess we'll have to wait and see when that PSP 2 is coming out that doesn't exist but does exist yeah
7351503	7351643	E3 E3 E3
7375417	7376317	I honestly think.
7376717	7382579	Because it's going to be all about where they're going to go with these newfangled things they've got on consoles.
7382599	7384379	The Kinect and the Move are here, so what's next?
7384419	7385359	Where's your killer app?
7385780	7386220	Let's see it.
7386480	7389500	I really don't think anyone's going to be announcing a new console this year.
7389580	7397562	I don't think the Wii HD is happening at a Nintendo at this point because I think they're going to really throw everything they've got into the 3DS this year.
7397582	7399303	I think that's everything you're going to be seeing.
7400363	7404564	Sony and Microsoft have no reason to give up what they're doing on their consoles right now
7405064	7412795	So, well, I guess the PSP 2 would be the one console that you're probably going to see more information about if it's not announced earlier.
7413196	7416441	As we've heard, you know, it might actually come out with Tokyo Game Developers Conference.
7416461	7416861	Who knows?
7417362	7418383	Could come out a lot sooner.
7419625	7420747	It's going to be a very interesting year.
7421512	7424016	I hopped on this generation of consoles pretty late.
7424036	7431205	I didn't get a 360, which is the first out of the two that I got, until Christmas of 08, so a little over two years.
7431685	7438193	The idea that the 360 is six years old or will be this summer, I can't wrap my head around that.
7438894	7439835	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7458055	7460418	They're saying the PS3 has a 10-year life cycle.
7460478	7460979	Come on.
7461019	7463222	You're full of crap.
7463242	7464864	I'm not ready to see new hardware yet.
7465024	7466426	I'm not either.
7466606	7469570	Actually, I would be a little bit pissed off if new hardware were out already.
7470010	7474436	Because it would be, oh, 3D, and you need 3D TVs for it and everything.
7475297	7475638	I don't know.
7476880	7480782	You already made me buy upgrades to the current consoles with the Kinect and the Move.
7481182	7484123	Although I didn't buy the Move, but give me reasons to really love these things.
7484143	7485504	You'll have it by this summer, I'm sure.
7485884	7487405	If there's a game to necessitate it.
7487465	7489546	There wasn't a game that necessitated me buying it.
7489986	7496049	I would even argue that maybe I shouldn't have bought the Kinect, but I do really like Dance Central and some of the other stuff, so I'm okay with it.
7496469	7498570	But I really don't have a reason to get a Move right now.
7499070	7499451	So I don't know.
7500351	7503933	And there's a lot of people out there saying, you know, DarkToagak in our chatroom says, I still don't have a 360.
7506092	7508455	Are people still calling it next-gen consoles?
7508475	7509776	Because I think we're past that, right?
7509936	7512519	Yeah, I made that mistake for about two years after it was out.
7512679	7513159	Current gen.
7515856	7516876	Next Gen, we don't know.
7516916	7518177	There is no Next Gen yet.
7518557	7518877	We'll see.
7519537	7520757	All right, well, I don't know.
7520837	7525119	One person that wants to play a little more in what's going on in the console world, it's GameStop.
7525579	7529720	They want to link you with a GameStop ID on their console.
7530240	7533281	That's because GameStop is selling more of the digital stuff in their stores.
7533801	7543424	They had an interview with Ars Technica not that long ago, and the senior vice president of GameStop, Sean Freeman, said that while the company's doing a good job of selling Microsoft Points cards...
7544864	7545324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7571145	7575107	I still never understood the reason why I would want to even do this.
7576008	7586656	Honestly, I mean, if you're going to, say, for example, buy download content from them, just buy a fucking 1600 point card or something like that.
7587016	7590479	Why are you going to give them your information for this stuff?
7591199	7598684	Even if you're not interested in purchasing a ton of download content and you have no games to trade in, why the fuck would you ever...
7599725	7609071	Leave your home, go to a store to buy something that you could just flip your console on and download straight from the marketplace and download straight to your console.
7609191	7613213	And I tell you, by the time you drove to the store and back, it would already be downloaded.
7614814	7620338	So I just don't understand why you would even waste the time to go give them money.
7621785	7640974	and you're paying tax on top of that I'm making stink face at this whole idea to have a separate layer of a GameStop ID that's just yet another account that I have to sync with my XBLA or whatever if they want to be the middle man in that another password that could possibly get exploited yeah this is a dumb idea and I don't get it
7641354	7644775	Well, I think GameStop to some extent is doing what they feel they have to do to survive.
7645196	7652699	Because I think we've said this on the show before that GameStop is going to go the way of Blockbuster Video real soon if something doesn't happen.
7652739	7653419	No, they're not.
7653699	7654279	Here's the thing.
7654399	7658561	They're not going anywhere because they're the biggest fish in the sea out there.
7658581	7659841	So was Blockbuster at one time.
7659881	7660942	No, no, no, no.
7661002	7670466	This is totally different because you see the game publisher or the movie studios, they don't need Blockbuster like they need GameStop because
7671306	7672647	Blockbuster rents movies.
7672707	7673887	They don't sell movies.
7674208	7678290	And unfortunately, they make more money in the sell-through business than they do in the rental business.
7678590	7683512	If Blockbuster was a big powerhouse in selling movies, that would be a different thing altogether.
7683952	7687014	But GameStop, they're a big powerhouse when it comes to sell-through.
7687334	7688175	And unfortunately...
7689395	7692496	They could dictate to the publishers what the fuck do they want them to do.
7692696	7694136	So they say, you know what?
7694216	7696056	We still want you to put physical copies out.
7696336	7697937	They're going to put physical copies out.
7698397	7714340	They're just trying to get into the DLC stuff because they figure, hey, we can get some more money from that because we can just pay Microsoft or whatever or a small little kickback for these things, but we get some money out of that transaction, and that's more money for us because we don't actually have to sell any physical goods.
7714420	7715700	It's digital stuff now.
7716300	7746021	so that's what that's all about I mean if they really wanted to I mean they have little cards and stuff that I guess they have made for them but that's all it's about it's not about them trying to survive it's about them being fucking greedy that's all it is they don't need to be in this business at all why are they selling well I guess I should say why are they selling PC games digitally but they are but I mean they're in no way going to be able to compete well with Steam or something it's just it's just all about them looking for more money
7747919	7757286	Looking at our comments from chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Brad from PodCulture says, Used to work at Blockbuster back in the day, and yes, Blockbuster does sell movies, new and used.
7757386	7767793	I know that they do, but they're not like a Walmart where Walmart sells hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and thousands of movies versus Blockbuster's, oh, we're bringing in some extra for sell-through.
7767933	7769314	It's way different.
7769614	7770254	and many more.
7791528	7792269	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7814522	7843444	now everything is released at sell-through pricing and so there's really no incentive for somebody to well I mean there is an incentive for people to rent stuff because it's still cheaper but it's less of an incentive now because they can just go to the store and buy their movie new you know because before they wouldn't be able to do that so that's why it's all shifted to you know the sell-through business and that's why Blockbuster is well it's why it's Blockbuster's failing you know that and they're losing out to you know kiosk vendors and stuff like that but
7843544	7844944	DarkSakura has arrived back from her event.
7844964	7845204	Welcome back.
7845244	7845364	Hi.
7845404	7846165	You've been missed tonight.
7846185	7846745	How are you doing?
7872293	7873517	I'm pinballed out.
7874179	7877790	I played nothing but Rocky and Bullwinkle and I played Theater of Magic before we actually got there.
7878510	7880210	Steve Ritchie was there and he's really cool.
7905677	7910519	I mentioned earlier in the show you were texting me this morning that you were rubbing elbows with some famous pinball peeps.
7910919	7911339	That's pretty cool.
7911359	7913580	Did you give us an interview for the show?
7913960	7916741	No, but his wife and I talked for a long time and she's really sweet.
7917061	7917341	Oh, good.
7917601	7921743	Yeah, Dan's in there saying we probably could.
7922283	7922983	He's really cool.
7923003	7926504	I mean, I've just sat and chatted with him before at conventions.
7926544	7926824	Sure.
7927044	7929185	What tables did he work on?
7929545	7934727	He did No Fear and Black Knight, which are both ones that we have, and he did the voices in them.
7934987	7936868	Oh, right, because you're very proud of your autograph.
7936908	7937148	Hold on.
7937168	7939189	Dan, just come in here and answer the damn question.
7940269	7942070	Dan just been driving for two hours.
7942290	7943110	You was away.
7943170	7944251	You were like in the Bay Area, right?
7945311	7947172	Actually, somewhere near French Camp.
7948204	7949464	Oh, that's not down by Stockton.
7949504	7949724	Okay.
7949764	7950945	Yeah, just past Stockton.
7951125	7951925	Oh, you're going the other way.
7951985	7953945	But we rode with someone in Davis.
7954425	7958126	So that's why we gave the update from Davis.
7958166	7958706	Sure, sure.
7958866	7959266	Gotcha.
7960046	7961626	But I played a lot of Rocky and Bullwinkle.
7962507	7967687	And there was a Whirlwind and Safecracker, I think, was one of them.
7968768	7971708	And they have a really, really pretty Twilight Zone.
7972448	7974209	Like with the topper and everything.
7975269	7975409	And...
7977205	7978286	All kinds of good stuff.
7978346	7979666	Rob, would you like a chair?
7982928	7983809	Yeah, sorry for the dead air.
7983829	7987410	I'm getting hammered with chat and chairs, switcheroo and all that at once.
7987431	7989632	He hit him with a metal chair!
7989652	7990832	Boom!
7991493	7992073	No.
7993434	8003039	But it was pretty fun and then my hips started to hurt and I started to get grumpy so I sat down and got on my laptop for a little bit and had a lot of beer.
8003868	8004408	Good time.
8004508	8005669	So you've been drinking a little bit.
8005969	8007149	Three Newcastles and a Guinness.
8007169	8007730	That's not a lot.
8007750	8008510	That's nothing for you.
8008550	8009691	You should have seen me last night.
8010171	8011271	I mentioned this earlier on the show.
8011311	8016814	I was out with Rice Princess and Extifer and Grandpa Warcraft from the other show and Salacious Pop here.
8017174	8019135	We were all out and I got drunk.
8019375	8022336	Like I made an ass of myself in front of Rice Princess and Extifer.
8024157	8026259	I know, I actually will... Oh, sorry, you were muted there.
8026359	8027020	Oh, sorry.
8027621	8031504	You're so drunk that he agreed to go to Denny's for the after bar food.
8031765	8033907	I hate Denny's with a passion.
8034127	8037130	Like, I just burned out on Denny's in my early 20s, right?
8037550	8039712	Because that was the post-club place to go.
8039752	8043636	Well, keep in mind, for the rest of you guys that aren't in California, we don't really have diners here.
8043716	8045037	Like, diners are unheard of here.
8045117	8046979	There is no such thing as a Waffle House restaurant.
8047079	8048120	Which is a shame.
8048320	8049601	No mom-pa diners.
8049621	8050142	There's nothing like that.
8050162	8050782	We have Denny's.
8050962	8052223	Denny's, Denny's, Denny's, Denny's, Denny's.
8052343	8052644	Everywhere.
8052664	8054245	We had Lion's and we had Eppie's.
8054705	8055846	None of them are 24 hours anymore.
8056367	8056947	And they're gone.
8057128	8058709	Yeah, so it's Denny's.
8058789	8061091	And last night when I was drunk, I wanted chicken strips.
8062450	8063372	They sobered him right up.
8064092	8065815	Greasy chicken strips, a good hangover cure.
8065835	8075947	Well, you remember my last super drunk time that I was hanging out with you, other than the time at Tia's when they lit up in the apartment and it made me throw up, was the waffles.
8076648	8077349	The waffle incident.
8080276	8081197	It's Carby stuff, Rob.
8081497	8083098	It's the greasy Carby stuff.
8083479	8083799	All right.
8085140	8086521	I guess I should pull up the chat room.
8086561	8090224	You'd be very proud of... We've gotten through most of your news tonight already.
8090244	8091525	You'd be very proud of Salacious Pop.
8091545	8092466	He did a fine job.
8093346	8094647	He picked the classic game of the week tonight.
8094667	8095628	What was it?
8095688	8096309	King's Quest IV.
8097229	8097710	Ooh.
8097750	8100974	Which, of course, the Rosella, yeah, game, which was one of the best in the series.
8101635	8102075	Very good.
8102135	8105499	Figured since, you know, you tend to give Sega a lot of love.
8105519	8107622	Because Sega deserves my love.
8107642	8110505	Salacious Pop went to the PC market, which I thought was cool.
8110525	8114911	But we did determine today on the ride back that Sega makes crappy pinball tables.
8116292	8124842	Alright, let's get to the mailbag you guys at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and sadly there's not a lot in the mailbag tonight.
8125883	8127405	Where's my mailbag music?
8127545	8128987	Is there Viagra spam?
8129007	8129928	Because you can just read that.
8131710	8132190	Not this week.
8132510	8134351	I'll go ahead and do it since DarkSakura is still getting set up.
8134371	8136391	Do you want to be uncomfortably hard?
8136812	8141853	Well, also, a lot of it's my fault with the whole lack of podcast feed updating.
8141913	8145554	But again, a new show went up today and we'll continue throughout the three-day weekend.
8145574	8147735	I have tomorrow off, so I'm going to work on OLR stuff.
8147915	8149075	Before I forget, 71 is...
8152029	8152690	Thanks for watching!
8170922	8175985	Unfortunately, some bonehead did something really, really, really, really, really bad.
8176145	8178487	And now it's making a lot of people think differently.
8179047	8182489	And in response... Let me read the email here from Rob.
8183050	8188813	In response to Jared Lee Lauder gun attack, it appears the following article replaces video games with political rhetoric.
8189233	8191837	The article is good, even though the study mentioned is weak.
8203223	8209785	Oh yeah, they just kind of go through this study and they just replace the words video games with violent rhetoric.
8209805	8212666	And it's kind of like, gee, haven't we seen this whole thing before?
8213026	8213487	IDK.
8214067	8221709	But Rob says, My point of view, and I know I've said this before in a mailbag letter, is that a person is solely responsible for what influences him or her.
8222169	8226551	Although from what I've read of the Arizona shooting, the shooter was extremely mentally ill and without treatment.
8226891	8232493	We may be looking at a situation where the parents did not know about paranoid schizophrenia and therefore didn't get treatment for him.
8232993	8233654	Don't worry, though.
8233694	8235376	Video games are also being blamed.
8235656	8236037	Of course.
8236337	8236898	Aren't they always?
8237418	8238279	From all the 2Bs.
8238499	8244947	And it's just unfortunate, you know, in these times of tragedy, everybody's, you know, kind of pointing the finger at what there is to blame.
8245027	8246549	And I don't know...
8248030	8274129	all of it's to blame to an extent but what's most to blame is this individual an individual is responsible for their actions and it's I don't know it's just it's a not an easy situation with not an easy answer to it but you know you have to look to how to prevent this type of stuff in the future and we're all going to pay for it because you know it's not going to be it's going to make our congress people less accessible in the future it's just unfortunate
8275942	8278163	And yeah, I kind of agree with Frisbee in our chat room.
8278203	8279283	This guy is a psycho.
8279443	8280103	End of line.
8280383	8282484	Yeah, that's kind of how I feel about it.
8284045	8284425	There you go.
8284465	8285605	That's it for the emails this week.
8285645	8289826	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I'm expecting this thing to be full next week.
8290307	8291507	Full with stories next week.
8292747	8299549	Loki has another news story for us and then we're going to get to the Skype line here in just a minute at OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or our phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR
8302096	8305617	Yes, last thing I had to talk about, and this is not a surprise.
8305717	8307618	I mean, I guess this is a surprise for a Wii game.
8308258	8311559	Just Dance 2 has gone five times platinum.
8311619	8313939	That's right, it sold five million copies.
8315000	8318961	And that's not bad, considering the fact it came out at the end of October.
8319041	8321182	That's way too much, Kesha, for me.
8321462	8325803	That is insane, though, that it's done that well.
8327389	8332032	Yeah, to put this in contrast, we just had a story earlier in the show where you were saying, Hey, Dance Central's doing great.
8332132	8333733	It sold 1 million copies.
8335074	8340837	We just mentioned now Just Dance has sold 5 million copies.
8340857	8343699	It's not like Just Dance Franchise has sold 5 million copies.
8343799	8346521	It's this one game has sold 5 million copies.
8346781	8347941	That is crazy.
8348142	8350043	It is so popular.
8351525	8356760	I'm surprised that Ubisoft hasn't brought the Just Dance franchise to other consoles now.
8357001	8358666	They have the Move and the Kinect stuff.
8359218	8363239	Well, the Michael Jackson game, isn't that really just a Just Dance Michael Jackson game?
8363339	8363559	It is.
8363599	8364940	And that's coming out on the other systems.
8364960	8367961	I bet you, though, that we'll see Just Dance 3 come out on all the platforms.
8368321	8368781	Oh, I'm sure.
8368961	8375283	The move would be stupid easy to port because it's very similar.
8375703	8382225	Connect, a little different, and it's going to be hard to separate it now from Dance Central, kind of beat them to the punch a little bit on Connect.
8382725	8388167	But if Dance Central and Dance Masters can kind of coexist... And Dance Paradise.
8388687	8389307	Oh yeah, that one.
8389387	8390268	That's not out here, is it?
8390408	8390828	February.
8391168	8392128	Wow, okay.
8392689	8394049	Then I guess there'll be room for this too.
8394489	8395089	But you know what?
8395310	8397070	Then I think I've had enough dancing games.
8397470	8403073	Like, they need to kill each other off in a battle royale and one will be left standing, which will probably be Dance Central.
8403133	8404453	Get some Highlander up in this.
8404573	8408194	So for real, for real, I want to see the head chopped off of Dance Masters.
8410695	8411856	There can be only one.
8412056	8412336	Exactly.
8412376	8413997	And make it be really good and I will buy that one.
8417486	8419347	Evacuate the dance floor.
8419768	8420268	Oh, all right.
8420608	8421669	Forget it.
8421709	8423030	Moving on to one more song here.
8423270	8423950	Or sorry, song.
8424911	8425832	One more story here.
8425892	8427373	Maybe it'll have a song and dance with it.
8427893	8430675	Cooking Mama has arrived on Facebook.
8431175	8431776	That's right.
8432376	8434157	Mama will fix Facebook now.
8434197	8436719	The Cooking Mama franchise has arrived on Facebook this week.
8437119	8439501	Friends Cafe is the name of the game.
8439801	8441822	So we're going to dub it then Clicky Mama, right?
8442042	8442863	Yes, Clicky Mama.
8443023	8444144	Facebook game is click, click, click.
8444164	8444544	That's right.
8444624	8445185	Clicky Mama.
8445525	8445965	Don't worry.
8446185	8446946	Mama will click it.
8447706	8451728	You can visit the game at Facebook.com slash Cooking Mama Cafe.
8452628	8457110	It has some of the same food preparation gameplay, of course, that you're used to seeing in the series.
8457690	8460872	There's also unlockable upgrades for your personal kitchen.
8461072	8463493	Of course, you can buy them as well because it's a Facebook game.
8464754	8467676	And if you neglect your cafe, you will see it shut down.
8469818	8470598	So there you go.
8470678	8475322	If you want to see what's going on in the Cookie Mama world, you can now explore that on Facebook.
8476543	8479946	I wonder how many people will abandon Knights of the Crystals to go play Friends Cafe.
8479966	8480386	I don't know.
8480726	8481807	I just allowed it.
8482167	8482748	Oh, God.
8482768	8482748	83.
8483568	8485750	I'm level 83 in that game.
8485770	8487672	And I think Salacious Pop is actually higher than me.
8487732	8490654	Yeah, I've run out of stuff to do, really, in Knights of the Clicky.
8491741	8493666	and it's so... Heights of the Clicky is not even a good game.
8493686	8494708	I've already given up on it.
8494748	8495670	Why do I keep playing it?
8496011	8498877	Except I click on your... Rob wants help.
8498998	8499880	Yay, thank you.
8499920	8500381	I appreciate it.
8500401	8500682	That's it.
8502001	8504444	They have released new stages, quote unquote.
8504464	8507987	Like I just unlocked the Merman from doing the underwater stages.
8508087	8509128	So that's about all they do.
8509328	8512451	But for every new map that they open up, they also release one.
8512671	8514053	It only requires pay items.
8514353	8514733	Of course.
8514753	8515474	To progress in.
8515554	8516315	That's how it works.
8516875	8517396	You know what?
8517656	8520138	It's all going to shit when the Civilization game comes out.
8520158	8520839	That's how I feel.
8520899	8522861	I want that damn Civilization game now.
8523582	8526024	That's when you'll dust off your credit card for a Facebook title.
8526144	8526344	For real.
8526364	8526645	For real.
8527385	8528686	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line.
8528726	8529607	It is open right now.
8529687	8530868	Oh, no, I'm just kidding.
8530928	8531228	It's not.
8531268	8532329	We've got to do the FUs of the week.
8533210	8535391	You can still... We didn't do the FUs of the week yet.
8535732	8535852	Oh.
8536252	8537173	I'm bad.
8537793	8538554	I did a bad thing.
8538614	8539655	We didn't get the angst out.
8539755	8544479	Oh, Rob, you're so... I was just distracted by you getting back to the studio.
8544779	8545620	Am I DJing so bad?
8556122	8558145	Uh, F you to my hip.
8560047	8560348	Fucker.
8561489	8561729	Done.
8562851	8563472	Salacious pop.
8565667	8570090	F you, I guess, to me not really knowing how awesome Panera Bread is up until just recently.
8570110	8576515	It's a pretty good month so far, so no angst.
8577076	8586804	F you to the fact that I have a very tough decision coming up, and I think I know what I'm going to do, and it's not going to make some people very happy with me, but in the end, I know that it's the thing I've got to do.
8587404	8590747	It has nothing to do with this program or anything you guys know about me, so it's just...
8591107	8593349	I'm being cryptical on purpose, but I don't like these tough decisions.
8593369	8594230	I think I know what it is.
8594591	8594971	Oh, you do?
8595151	8595351	Yeah.
8595491	8595932	I know you do.
8596192	8596693	So does Jamie.
8596933	8597133	Yeah.
8597714	8598655	But sorry, listeners.
8598895	8599375	It's private.
8599696	8599916	Loki.
8601231	8605953	FU to my JTAG constantly broken and it was really broken.
8605973	8617517	I actually sent it away to be reballed, which is where they pull the chips off and they put new solder balls on them and actually upleaven them how they should have been and that didn't even fix it.
8617717	8621519	So it's broke.
8622399	8624600	Alright, that's going to do it for the FUs of the week.
8625683	8628965	Let's go to the Skype line, but we're going to start the Skype line tonight with something a little special.
8629005	8639892	We're actually going to place a call right now and get him on the line here so we can get an update on what's going on with one of our partner shows.
8639952	8641073	Hi, Bresla, are you there?
8641994	8642254	What?
8642394	8642674	Huh?
8642834	8644135	Bresla, how you doing?
8644415	8644956	Hi.
8645336	8645636	Hi.
8645656	8645696	Hi.
8646136	8646457	Hi.
8647157	8647417	Hi.
8647497	8648358	Guy, hi.
8648478	8648698	What?
8648998	8649218	What?
8649498	8650059	Oh, shit.
8650902	8653103	There's a lot of shit that gets in there, honestly.
8653283	8655964	I voted on the current brackets and there's some weird shit in there.
8680529	8687176	Yeah, it's because people like SSJ100Matt say, hey, Blade of Steel number one, and then it gets a 12 seed.
8687616	8693843	So, anyways, voting for the Bresla region actually closes in about half an hour.
8695044	8700610	For the first region, it'll close, and then I'll announce the next line of games when we get into the real meat and potatoes.
8700750	8702411	Basically, Chrono Trigger comes to play.
8702512	8703252	That's all that happens.
8704353	8707594	But I have some scores here of some games I thought y'all would be interested in.
8707994	8708354	Alrighty.
8709034	8712355	So I'll start with the OLR region because it's your region.
8715256	8719017	Secret of Mana is beating Katamari Namashi right now.
8719977	8720597	It's pretty close.
8721178	8722778	Quake is losing to Half-Life.
8723561	8723781	Yes.
8724122	8725303	I'm okay with both of those.
8725483	8726624	You know, Quake and Half-Life.
8726964	8732149	Sometimes, and the weird thing about USL Madness is that sometimes the pairings are really hard early on.
8732549	8742738	And you know, that's true of any tournament-style competition, but sometimes the pairings this early on, like Quake versus Half-Life, those are both games that deserve to move on, but just the way the brackets are set up, it's not going to happen.
8743138	8744219	Yeah, and...
8745885	8747126	What else was I going to say about that?
8747727	8749929	It's like Mega Man 2 versus Mega Man 3 last year.
8749969	8752852	That was just probably one of the toughest decisions I had to make.
8752933	8758659	But at the same time, at that point, there really only needed to be one Mega Man game that represents them all, you know?
8759540	8788860	yeah but moving on the last one and this is a Bimani one so I had to throw it in there Parapara Paradise is narrowly losing to Sinistar right now that is such a weird matchup yeah I don't know how that works you know what though as much as I love my dancey games I don't think Parapara is the dancey game I would choose to represent sorry Misty I know you're going to hate me for that but Sinistar did bring us the whole beware I live which is pretty awesome
8789500	8794782	But moving on to the Harper region, WoW is barely beating Bionic Commando.
8795062	8796222	It's by like a vote.
8796662	8797103	Wow.
8797663	8798423	Yeah, exactly.
8799723	8805585	Pong is beating System Shock in probably the most bizarre first round matchup and it's beating it pretty soundly.
8807346	8808386	Here's a head scratcher.
8808646	8810687	Kingdom Hearts is beating Arkham Asylum.
8812788	8813448	Interesting.
8814289	8828338	Well, knowing the listeners of this show that mostly prefer the import stuff, I mean, if I were to say the majority of the listeners, not all of them, but I know the majority of our folks are kind of into the Squeenix import stuff, that doesn't surprise me.
8830169	8834052	I can't speak for USL, but I know we have a lot of the same listeners, so it wouldn't surprise me.
8855926	8857748	As it doesn't need to be.
8857988	8859009	Looking good for it.
8859790	8863874	And speaking of Blades of Steel, it's losing to Dragon Quest IX right now pretty badly.
8864194	8864414	Ouch.
8865615	8866896	Moving on to the wrestler region.
8866997	8870300	I'm also not saying all of these games because it would be 32 matchups.
8870340	8874203	We'd be here forever and Rob, Jamie, and Loki have things to do tonight.
8874363	8878888	Where can you kind of like follow the action on what's going on at USL Madness?
8879868	8889051	I haven't been posting the results, but time and again I will every day post like, oh hey, this matchup's close, or this region needs votes.
8889291	8891731	The OLR region really needs votes right now.
8893412	8895512	And then I'm going to finally go to the wrestler region here.
8897013	8900794	Final Fantasy X is just barely beating Crazy Taxi.
8903475	8907116	Borderlands is beating the ever-loving snot out of the Call of Duty series.
8908036	8908276	Which
8909665	8914988	Yeah, that one was like, that could go either way, but I wouldn't be upset if Borderlands won.
8915048	8917149	And then here's probably the most interesting one.
8917189	8923193	Tecmo Super Bowl is losing to Halo Reach by about 10% right now.
8923613	8927495	No, that is not even the Halo game that should be representing the Halo franchise, I'm sorry.
8927675	8929276	Halo 2, all the way.
8929676	8933298	If it was Halo 2 beating it, then I'd be a little more sympathetic, but Halo Reach, no.
8933799	8934039	No.
8935020	8937761	Yeah, but those are just some of the matchups.
8938441	8940802	If you want to vote, I will post the link again in chat.
8941202	8945404	If you're listening live, the Breslau region closes in 20 minutes.
8945424	8948125	So you better vote now, bitches.
8948865	8955988	Yeah, Donovan region will close Monday night, Harper region will close Wednesday night, and since I was late on OLR, OLR region will close Friday night.
8956348	8959789	All right, and you'll be posting all the updates in our forums at orangelaunchradio.com, correct?
8960103	8966607	Yes, and probably here before you guys sign off, I will have the results of the Breastler region so you see what games go on and what faces what.
8966867	8967728	Alright, sounds good.
8968569	8969669	Thank you for putting this all together.
8969689	8971991	It's a little fun, nerd stuff, but fun.
8972671	8976514	Yeah, and I gotta ask before I go, who do you got this year?
8976634	8977414	Who do you think's gonna win?
8977574	8978675	Who do I think's gonna win this year?
8978775	8979776	Duh, Super Metroid.
8979996	8981997	It needs to reclaim the throne, of course.
8983718	8985900	I wouldn't be upset if Final Fantasy VI won.
8987559	8990424	For a game that... Because Final Fantasy VI has never won before, right?
8990804	8992747	No, it got to the finals for the first time last year.
8992767	8993889	I would be okay with that.
8993909	8996613	What other games have gotten really close but haven't won yet?
8996973	8997054	Um...
8998393	9004155	Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Super Mario Bros.
9004195	9006096	and Mega Man 2 all have gotten really close.
9006196	9010638	I would be okay with any of those winning the whole thing except for Ocarina of Time.
9014680	9016481	Ocarina of Time is just like Chrono Trigger to me.
9016541	9019442	I don't understand everybody's heart on for it.
9019722	9021383	Link to the Past forever.
9022623	9023283	Yeah.
9023323	9024684	But anyways, guys, that's it.
9024884	9029045	I will talk to you guys probably next week here, and y'all have a good night.
9029105	9030245	All right, you too, Brest Lowell.
9030265	9031865	Have a good one, and good luck with USL.
9032125	9035506	And keep Donovan and Jessica Harper in check for us.
9036606	9037167	I'll try.
9037547	9037827	All right.
9038947	9039187	Later.
9039867	9040127	Later.
9041168	9041548	All right.
9041788	9044708	If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is now open for everyone.
9044768	9045409	Yay!
9045429	9045669	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9047569	9049589	or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9049609	9052150	Let's go right to the phones because they've been ringing while we were on that last call.
9052190	9053110	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9053130	9053470	Who's this?
9056431	9056831	Hello.
9057371	9058371	We're off to a great start tonight.
9058391	9059531	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9059551	9059971	Who's this?
9061352	9062052	Hey, what's up, guys?
9062092	9062792	This is Kaijudo.
9063012	9063812	Hey, Kaijudo.
9063852	9064272	There you are.
9064312	9064792	What's up, buddy?
9066193	9066513	Not much.
9066673	9068773	I just called to recommend a game to you guys.
9069153	9069593	Please do.
9069653	9069993	What game?
9070133	9072014	It's a PC game.
9072054	9072894	It's a first-person shooter.
9073601	9077943	I heard you all talking about you were fans of the original GoldenEye for the N64.
9078203	9079723	The original GoldenEye was pretty badass.
9079763	9080143	I liked it.
9081464	9083685	Alright, well then you need to pick up this mod.
9084505	9085485	You need Steam, of course.
9085525	9087646	You need either Half-Life 2.
9087706	9090987	I'm not going to get into all of the games, but you know what I'm saying when I say you need a Valve game.
9091007	9095029	You need Half-Life 2 or Portal or Team Fortress.
9095049	9095889	You know, one of those.
9096209	9097370	Actually, is it Team Fortress?
9097390	9097730	I'm not sure.
9098150	9100031	Just get Half-Life 2 Deathmatch, which is just $4.99.
9101055	9107403	You get that and then you can download this GoldenEye Source mod, which is the best freaking game, period, that I've ever played.
9108228	9109948	I think you all need to check it out.
9110448	9110928	Interesting.
9110968	9111789	You're a big Half-Life fan.
9111989	9117050	I am hugely into Half-Life 2 and the Source Half-Life 2 engine.
9117090	9124331	I've played a ton of mods and add-ons, expansions that are fan-made for Half-Life 2 and I know exactly what he's talking about.
9124431	9127451	I haven't checked it out, but yeah, I will now.
9127771	9128812	I've heard of this.
9128952	9130372	It looks pretty awesome.
9130412	9131392	They just went out of beta.
9132252	9133512	Maybe people have played it before.
9135173	9136613	I guess it was version 2, version 3, and
9137614	9143337	Maybe they didn't like it, but this new update, the release version, oh my god, it'll blow you away.
9143498	9145199	The maps are just incredible.
9145659	9149381	The best first-person shooter maps you'll ever play, and a first-person shooter to date.
9150082	9150942	And I mean that.
9150982	9155665	Like, I'll ban myself from all games if you guys don't like that game.
9157644	9158884	You don't have to do that.
9159465	9160665	Everybody has different opinions.
9160885	9162406	I'll check it out, especially if it's kind of cheap.
9162466	9163847	I think I already have Half-Life 2.
9164107	9165428	I can't remember if I have it on PC.
9165908	9167349	I think I've been playing it on Xbox.
9167389	9172191	But I have Portal and Team Fortress.
9172331	9174592	Portal should be enough by itself.
9174732	9180375	Any game that uses the source SDK in the Half-Life 2 family will let you run this add-on.
9180495	9181376	So Portal should do it.
9183534	9187256	I guess I'll have to check that out, and we'll see if this guy gets banned from all games forever.
9187297	9188017	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
9188197	9189798	Me mishearing you for a second, Rob.
9189818	9190418	No, I mean it, though.
9190559	9192200	I'm serious about this.
9192460	9193781	You really need to check that game out.
9193821	9195842	I think these guys need to be supported.
9195862	9199904	I think they spent about five years making this mod, and it really shows.
9199944	9207289	I mean, the maps are just... I mean, they have the original maps from the N64 game, and then they built their own maps, and you're just like...
9208217	9209761	How the heck can they do all this?
9209781	9210844	It's just really great.
9241434	9242635	His hair, of course, his hair.
9242655	9244136	Breakfast Club Frag Edition.
9244917	9245497	Yeah.
9245517	9251862	I mean, you've got your different classes, your cliques, and they're a different class.
9252642	9258886	The cheerleader is athletic and can kick people in the face and has the booby attack.
9259247	9259487	Nice.
9260067	9263990	And then there's the football player who's really big and stupid.
9265236	9268077	Yeah, I played the Wii version first, and then when I got on GoldenEye Source, I mean, it totally...
9293533	9296054	Dwarf, the Wii's version, the online part of it.
9296154	9304116	I mean, they don't have a story version, and I do like the Wii's story version of GoldenEye, but multiplayer, there's nothing like it.
9304176	9305136	You really need to check it out.
9305696	9319460	When I last heard of this GoldenEye mod specifically, it was still in alpha, and this was months and months ago, which is why I never checked it out, but the one Half-Life 2 mod I really need to come out this year is Black Mesa, the Half-Life 1 remake.
9320160	9340184	that's been vaporware for six years and now that this GoldenEye is actually in beta and going to have a release version soon this needs to light the fire under the butt of those that are working on Black Mesa Source I need it to happen well unfortunately we lost the caller there I don't know if he accidentally hung up on us or if there was a connection issue I swear I didn't click a button to hang up on him
9340564	9344726	But, Kaijudo, thank you so much for the call and we will definitely check out that game in the future.
9344806	9346387	So, our Skype line is back open again.
9346527	9348268	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
9348288	9349989	1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number.
9350009	9350709	You can give us a call.
9351349	9354971	I'll just throw over to Loki real quick if you have any last minute stories you want to throw out there.
9355031	9355351	I don't know.
9355531	9356111	Just real quick.
9356452	9358853	Arcade Infinity is not closing after all.
9359813	9360313	That's right.
9360654	9362555	There's a story about that on our very own website.
9363775	9366957	And, yeah, they still had a big party this weekend, though, just to kind of celebrate.
9367497	9369658	So many people were wanting to go out anyway, so...
9371437	9374960	Hey Brad, I haven't heard from you in a long time, how are you doing buddy?
9397337	9398518	Short, fat, and going bald.
9399699	9400379	Sounds like me.
9401940	9404382	Well, what's new in your world besides fat?
9404582	9406143	DC Universe Online.
9406503	9407244	Ah, of course.
9407264	9409285	There's a lot of nerds very happy that this is out this week.
9409305	9409825	What do you think?
9410586	9411727	Oh, I'm loving it.
9411907	9416830	It's still got its issues, like any of those kind of games at launch.
9418051	9420952	But I am really digging it because I am a huge comic book nerd.
9420972	9421973	PS3 or a PC?
9422013	9422113	PS3.
9425126	9425907	Really?
9426607	9433654	The way the controls feel, it actually feels like it's made for a console.
9434076	9462271	you're actually right in that regard I think because even when I was playing it on the PC I plugged in the Xbox 360 controller which is a little weird because the game wasn't made for that but it works and what's really interesting too is that when you do plug in the joystick all the little button symbols change to the PlayStation X's and O's which is weird if you're using a 360 controller but if you've been gaming long enough you know where those buttons are by you know feel so you can figure it out so cool were you playing a hero or a villain
9463273	9464638	Right now playing a hero.
9465722	9466324	And how's that going?
9466344	9467006	What level are you?
9468129	9470491	I am about back up to where I was with the beta.
9470991	9471952	I think I'm level 12 or 13.
9472072	9475994	It was a little bit of an ordeal to get my game.
9479056	9480156	Amazon screwed up the shipment.
9481537	9483658	Do you notice there's a lot of people in that right now?
9485139	9487381	I'm getting knocked off every once in a while.
9487461	9487801	Really?
9488221	9489842	Yeah, having some connection issues.
9489982	9496606	I don't know if it's my end here or just that everybody happens to be on the Crysis server or not.
9498623	9502146	How much patching did you have to do that first day?
9502586	9504748	Oh, the first day I had about 11 gig download.
9504808	9505748	Oh my gosh.
9506689	9507229	11 gigs?
9507550	9508390	It seemed like it.
9508530	9510312	It took a long time.
9511753	9512874	That is crazy.
9512974	9513194	Wow.
9513414	9515395	Well, how is it playing an MMO on the PS3?
9515436	9520860	Do you think MMOs can work on the PS3 now that this, you know, big... Because I think this is kind of the first one.
9520900	9522180	No, it was APB, I guess.
9522241	9524702	But this is really, you know, one of the first big ones.
9524742	9525343	I guess it's out.
9525996	9530278	If they can make it this kind of a control scheme, it could probably work.
9530418	9533320	It's pretty nice.
9534740	9541303	Are you able to talk to other people okay, or do you kind of not need to do that in your experiences with DC Universe Online?
9541383	9542864	Like, do you use a keyboard?
9543424	9544265	You can.
9544765	9550288	I went out and got the keypad for the PS3 controller, but...
9552043	9555445	Apparently you can do some chat, but it's a little weird to get it set up and working right.
9556826	9558326	You can just use your Bluetooth headset.
9559107	9561108	Do you find that the text, you can actually read it?
9561128	9566031	Because one of the complaints I've heard about the PS3 version is that the text is very small on HDTV.
9566611	9568192	It is a little small, but I've got a...
9569278	9569919	Thanks for watching!
9590111	9596096	I mean, if you like City of Heroes, that kind of stuff, it's definitely worth checking out.
9597157	9597497	All right.
9597717	9601701	I think I might have to check this out, but gosh, games are so expensive these days.
9602121	9604023	And I already have one MMO I'm subscribed to.
9604063	9606625	I don't need $30 a month to play MMOs.
9607025	9609467	Yeah, but you can get a good one now.
9610608	9610888	Nice.
9611048	9611769	I see what you did there.
9612202	9614883	All right, well, Brad, we've got to let you go, but do you have any other thoughts for us?
9615564	9616144	Nope, nope.
9616244	9618705	Just keep on doing what you're doing, and we'll keep listening.
9618866	9619786	All right, thank you so much.
9619806	9620807	And check out Brad's show.
9620847	9623608	It's PodCulture, available at podculture.net.
9623628	9624428	Am I right?
9624488	9629451	Podculture.net and soon-to-be podculture.com, because we are switching over to a new host.
9629471	9630812	We're going to be an indie show again.
9631332	9631873	Nice.
9631973	9632273	All right.
9632293	9634736	Well, welcome to the indie realm, I suppose.
9635257	9640684	And you can, of course, always look him up on iTunes, which is kind of the king of podcasts there.
9640964	9641204	All right.
9641224	9641665	Take care, buddy.
9642205	9642706	Later, guys.
9642746	9643026	Later.
9644068	9644829	It's good to hear from Brad.
9644869	9646811	It's been a very long time we've heard from Brad.
9647051	9650455	So glad to hear he's back in the gaming with whatever brought him back there.
9651276	9653378	We can probably do at least one more call here.
9653398	9657042	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9657462	9659985	We'll get to at least about one more call here before we wrap it up.
9660025	9661106	Any other last minute stories?
9663548	9665190	I'm sure I do have some.
9665430	9666151	Let's see here.
9669025	9669605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9695236	9710201	Going out, getting boxes, packing up my Nintendo games, calling them, getting the prices, packing it up, sending to them, waiting about a week and a half, getting some brand new Nintendo games and playing them for hours upon hours.
9711261	9715743	Oh yeah, that's how I got my copy of Ultima 3 Exodus on the NES was through Funkoland.
9717573	9725042	I remember playing Renegade a long time ago and I remembered that game sometime later and I started getting my hands on that and I believe Dragon Warrior 3.
9728438	9733780	That was my thing because it got to the point where I couldn't afford to get all the games I wanted.
9733800	9735401	So I figured I had all these stacks of games.
9735421	9737062	Might as well do something with it.
9737262	9740043	And then I find out there's a Funko Land.
9740083	9745665	And then during my junior high and high school years, that was my hangout spot.
9745685	9747426	I would go there all the time.
9747466	9749446	I met a lot of friends and stuff like that.
9749546	9749927	And then...
9751067	9776188	eventually I stopped going because half the managers got sent to different stores and the newer managers are assholes so I was like there's no point in going and then one day I just happened to roll in there and I go to the front counter and I'm like can I get a price sheet and they're like oh we don't do price sheets anymore and you have to go to the back of the line and I turn around I see this long line of people and I said the hell with this and I walked out
9780690	9783873	So is there a GameStop where that Funkoland used to sit?
9785915	9788337	Yeah, it really is.
9788858	9800830	And where I used to live, one of my best friends from high school, he finally told me about six months or so ago, they finally turned the software and our old shopping center into a Funkoland.
9804184	9804584	Wow.
9805627	9805987	Yeah.
9806328	9809595	I didn't think it would take like 15 years for him to change the logo on the front.
9812415	9815798	Yeah, you know, there's a store in, where was it that we were at?
9815858	9817599	It was Oregon, and we were in what?
9817619	9818400	It was Software Etc.
9818460	9819141	Was it Ashland?
9819241	9819842	No, Medford.
9820122	9820302	Yeah.
9820482	9821763	Is the city right north of Ashland, right?
9821783	9823245	And when we went inside, it was a GameStop.
9823405	9824286	It was just a GameStop.
9824306	9828730	But they had the white neon Software Etc., and it was like it was 1993 again.
9828810	9832093	I know, and I had to buy a game there, because I'm like, dude, it's Software Etc., I gotta buy a game here.
9832133	9834135	But even the receipt on it said GameStop.
9835336	9839601	I wouldn't bother because I'm anti-GameStop in the first place.
9848976	9850197	You're anti the man.
9850677	9851437	Stick it to the man.
9852138	9852398	Yes.
9852778	9853899	I'll say it once, I'll say it again.
9854239	9855179	Fuck GameStop.
9855659	9856020	Alright.
9856460	9858121	Well, on that note, we're gonna let you go, buddy.
9858941	9859241	Cool.
9859701	9860422	But have a good one.
9860902	9861262	You too.
9861402	9861883	Alright.
9861983	9868546	Reminiscing about the good old days with DJ Ranma S. Any other last minute stories, Loki?
9870803	9871503	Yeah, a couple things.
9871543	9872564	This is actually kind of funny.
9873045	9881772	Earth Defense Force 2, the new one that's coming out on PSP, they're actually selling it in a two-pack in Japan.
9882233	9883834	It's a double enlistment pack.
9883874	9889960	It contains two UMD copies of the game in their full packaging, bundled together for 6,279 yen versus...
9895965	9897386	and DarkSakura.
9926957	9928199	Hi Bobby, how are you?
9928760	9929561	I'm doing good.
9930001	9931043	You guys have a good show tonight.
9931423	9932765	Yeah, I'm having a good time.
9932805	9934187	I hope you've had a good time listening.
9934247	9941378	And I know you always have us on at the end of your show, so I'm always happy when you're able to get in amongst the Skype madness and be on the end of our show.
9942810	9943170	That's right.
9943250	9948795	I want everybody to vote against Poppin' and Parapara and DDR, which got a buy.
9948855	9949756	How did that even get in there?
9949956	9952438	Because too many people put it up towards the top of their list.
9952478	9962586	You have to remember, our station started as a museum, so a lot of the people... And bless them for sticking with us through all these years, the thick and thin and some of the tough decisions we've made, but we do have a lot of fans of that.
9962987	9967330	And obviously, USL has their listenership as well, but I know a lot of it is crossover.
9967410	9967510	Yeah.
9968411	9972995	The show, in some ways, was a spin-off of USL, so we have many listeners from back in that day.
9974296	9976057	And I'm going to say that, you know, I'm like you.
9976177	9980161	I wouldn't be mad if Final Fantasy VI won, as long as Super Metroid doesn't win.
9981141	9981842	Oh, hater.
9981882	9982562	Why are you hating?
9982582	9983723	Why are you hating on Super Metroid?
9984184	9984924	Because it sucks.
9985785	9986886	It does not suck.
9987286	9989408	It's the most amazing video game ever made.
9989448	9990809	Why are you hating on Super Metroid?
9991370	9993471	Because Super Metroid mimics a vacuum.
9995253	9995633	It sucks.
9997600	9999922	Is it sad that I actually had to stop and think about that one for it?
9999962	10001223	I'm like, you don't play in a vacuum.
10001243	10002845	What are you talking about?
10003245	10003966	Oh, you Bobby.
10004466	10005267	Curse you, Bobby.
10006869	10009491	Bobby, you just launched a new website for your show, right?
10009931	10010292	I did.
10010352	10012654	BobbyBlackWolf.com and the podcast is back.
10012894	10013295	I know.
10013355	10017418	Your podcast feed is more up to date than ours, but that will all change this week.
10017518	10017979	Here's the thing.
10018299	10020781	My episode from tonight already on the podcast feed.
10020841	10021402	Wow.
10021682	10022103	Amazing.
10023165	10024406	That hasn't happened in three years.
10024987	10025907	Good gosh.
10027068	10030110	You need to cancel doing second shows more often or something.
10030691	10031271	Exactly.
10031371	10036595	And I reviewed the Telltale game Back to the Future on my show, so people can go check that out.
10037257	10039278	I guess we have to go check it out to see what you really think.
10039318	10044000	But I was going to say, and I forgot to mention this on the call earlier, I'm really looking forward to the Jurassic Park game.
10044300	10050202	I don't know why, but I think it's because I liked the books when I was younger, and I remember seeing the original movies, except three.
10050542	10051262	Who bothered with three?
10051683	10061186	But I'm kind of excited to revisit those, because it's been a long time since those movies were out, and that whole stuff was big.
10061966	10063227	They never did make a fourth movie.
10063247	10066088	I don't know if they're ever going to, but it would be kind of fun to revisit that world, I think.
10067259	10076461	Yeah, and one of the things is when Heavy Rain came out, I even said I would love to play a Telltale game like Sam & Max using the Heavy Rain style of controls.
10077622	10085524	And now that's what they're going to be doing for Jurassic Park is doing more Heavy Rain type stuff than just point and click adventures.
10085924	10090545	And hopefully if it works for Jurassic Park, they'll do that in Sam & Max and probably add some of that.
10090874	10094356	Jason Jason Jason Jason Jason Jason Jason
10116923	10117403	DDR.
10118024	10118905	Vote against it next week.
10118925	10119605	He'll deal with it.
10120046	10123569	Every gamer has a voice, even when they're wrong, like you are.
10123889	10129073	All I gotta say is the next, was it Poker Night at the Inventory or whatever?
10129113	10130754	It's gonna be awesome.
10131035	10134978	With, you know, was it Christopher Lloyd and a T-Rex?
10135038	10136059	And a Velociraptor.
10139039	10140540	I'm all Jason.
10141920	10142260	All right.
10143361	10144741	Bobby, thanks so much for your call.
10144781	10145201	Take care.
10145722	10146102	Thank you.
10146242	10146502	Later.
10147362	10150223	Bobby Blackwolf, the man who does the show before us.
10150283	10153544	You go all in on the next Poker Night at the Inventory and the Velociraptor.
10154005	10154605	He's so pissed.
10154625	10156806	He just eats Strong Bad violently, gruesomely.
10156826	10157966	It's great.
10158986	10159787	Snaps him in half.
10160267	10160587	All right.
10160907	10163008	Any other last minute stories before we wrap up the show tonight?
10163248	10163868	Yeah, a few.
10164308	10167349	Minecraft has sold a million copies, which is pretty awesome.
10167409	10167749	Grats.
10168129	10172790	They have a new update for that as well that adds... I still haven't played it.
10172830	10173790	Am I a bad gamer?
10174050	10175311	I haven't really played it either.
10175331	10176191	I'm a bad gamer.
10176291	10177071	I downloaded it.
10177131	10178111	I thought I haven't played it.
10179992	10180492	Let's see.
10181292	10185153	They added some new recipes including squids and cake.
10187745	10188285	Okay.
10188365	10188746	Okay.
10205181	10206101	Let's see what else.
10206882	10211043	Remedy is bringing Death Rally for the iPhone.
10211843	10217344	Death Rally you may remember as an old Apogee game back from 1996.
10218805	10223046	Kind of a top-down combat racing game, which is kind of cool.
10224494	10233341	And then, speaking of iOS, the iPad has a bunch of ridiculous peripherals that were being shown off at CES.
10233621	10240827	And, of course, one of these is the iCade, which transforms your iPad into an arcade.
10240847	10242188	You can get that at ThinkGeek for $100.
10243349	10249494	Or, if you don't want to spend $100, but you still want some sort of tactile controller, they have a stick-on...
10251295	10257140	Joystick actually for $25 and it just sticks onto your iPad.
10257320	10258821	Maybe Apple should release one.
10259701	10260482	I think they should.
10260822	10270229	Honestly, I think they should have something that the iPhone or whatever plugs into or hell, if they wanted to do Bluetooth support for controllers or something, that'd be awesome.
10271490	10272611	It's what the people want.
10272976	10276119	Now that Verizon has their iPhone, they're just going to sell even more of them.
10276179	10281945	And it's just like if they were to release just a little controller that plugs into the bottom of those phones, I tell you, it's over.
10282946	10283126	Yeah.
10286072	10286412	Is that it?
10286773	10287153	That's it.
10304528	10333154	so please help us spread the word about our show leave us a nice review on iTunes we could always use those we haven't had any five star reviews in a while so if you have an iTunes account please consider leaving us one there and you know just tell a friend or two about the show we would really really appreciate it we can't finish up the show though until we go around and get everybody's final thought so Salacious Pop I'll start with you thank you for filling in tonight stepping up to the plate I know you didn't get a lot of notice on that so I appreciate you doing that for us my pleasure and do you have a final thought for us tonight
10336576	10337337	No, I'm good.
10338177	10339238	Vietnamese noodles after this.
10339298	10340119	Yay.
10340299	10341960	And we had blood orange pinkberry.
10342220	10344142	Blood orange pinkberry is the best thing ever.
10344162	10344782	So good.
10344842	10345823	That is my final thought.
10345863	10346844	Blood orange pinkberry.
10347124	10349826	If you have a pinkberry anywhere near you, you must go have the blood orange pinkberry.
10349906	10351747	I've never had better yogurt in my life.
10352027	10352728	It is great.
10353128	10354409	They need to keep that as a permanent flavor.
10354449	10355550	If they get rid of that, I'm going to be pissed.
10355910	10356130	Yeah.
10357271	10358252	I'm excited about food again.
10358452	10358972	Uber noms.
10359312	10360533	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
10361854	10362855	I had a lot of beer today.
10364008	10364789	Congratulations.
10365170	10366471	And Loki, your final thought tonight?
10367553	10371578	My final thought is this Aliens game looks weird.
10373280	10376384	Oh, that whole square one that was designed back in the day?
10376785	10382252	It looks like, I don't know, like a side-scrolling Metal Gear or something kind of interesting.
10382918	10384160	Alright, that's going to do it.
10384200	10385242	Thank you guys again.
10385402	10386303	We'll see you next week.
10386363	10392272	We're back here to do it all again next week, and we hope you'll join us live at allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
10392653	10396018	Of course, you can always stay tuned on our podcast feed, which, yes, will be updated.
10396098	10397440	And I'm sorry I was so naughty.
10397840	10398521	So thank you for...
10399229	10400470	Thank you for still standing by us.
10400710	10401151	We love you.
10401331	10401671	Good night.
10428252	10430294	But we're probably right anyway.
10430835	10431676	See you next week!
