00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's your hosts?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, January 16th, 2011

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Another MMO is set to go free to play this month

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
An upcoming fighting game plans to punish rage quitters

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
And will the 3DS be region locked after all?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
The show where every gamer has a voice

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
We tape live at All Games Radio

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you for the next few hours

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Along with my co-host, not here tonight sadly

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Is absent from the studio tonight

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
She may be coming about halfway through the show

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
But she is out at a pinball collecting type of event

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
It's a private thing so it's not something you would have read about on the internet

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
But she's having a pretty good time

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I know I got a text from her earlier today

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
That she met some famous pinball maker

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
So hopefully she makes it back in time during the show

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
And we can ask her all about her experience there

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I know there was beer involved

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I don't think there's any beer involved though

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
With our other co-hosts tonight

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm doing fine

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Alright, what's new in your world?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
How's the baby? How's the wife?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Uh, baby's fine

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
And wife is doing fine

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I don't know if she's over at her mom's house right now

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
She visits her every day

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Or, well, every Sunday

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
That's awesome that you guys have a Sunday planned

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
So you can kind of keep doing the show

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
We'd be screwed without Loki

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
She doesn't always get over there

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
I still come here

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Let's move on to a special guest joining us tonight

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Who's going to be filling in for Dark Sakura

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Now, Dark Sakura

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Her position could never be filled

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
But he's going to try

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Say hello everybody to Salacious Pop

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Hello

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
How are you Salacious Pop?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm great

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I'm pinch hitting for Jamie and I get to read stories

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
It'll be fun

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
If anyone hears a thud

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
It's because Rob threw a shoe at me

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Because I missed my story cue

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
And I'm letting there be dead air

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
So if you hear thud

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Stuff happened today

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
That's what happened there

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Just looking forward to it

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Again, I don't know how long Dark Sakura's going to be out

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
She didn't really give a firm time

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Because I think she just kind of didn't know

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
You know, sometimes you get invited to those things

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
And you're like, I don't know

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And I get the sense that it might be a little far away

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
It might be in the Bay Area

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
So if they haven't even left the par-tay yet

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
She might be gone for a while

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, so she might show up and just be like

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
You get the hell up out my seat

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Give me my mic and get out

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And that's when I'm going to, you know, bail to the living room

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com where we have the live chatters

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Every Sunday night while we do tape

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm noticing

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
ActDeaf in our chat room says, DarkSakura ain't home

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Party!

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Actually, it is a little weird

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
We're in her house right now

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
And she's very kind

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Her and Dan, really, because he lives here too

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Letting us kind of come in and do our show anyway

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I have the super secret way of getting in the house

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
When they're not here that I can't say

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Because, you know, we don't want the robbers to show up

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
But yeah, she's very kind

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
And letting us kind of take over the house

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
But it's a little weird, I think

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
To be in someone's house when they're not here

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
And it's not like a house sitting type of thing

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Like, I didn't feed Shermy

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Shermy doesn't need to be fed

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Shermy's just asleep, Shermy don't give a shit tonight

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
But anyhow, alright

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Enough talk about being in the house when the owners aren't home

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
And kiddies and so forth

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Let's talk about video games

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And we'll start off tonight with how is your gaming week

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
We have to mix it up a little bit tonight because DarkSakura's not here

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
So we'll start with Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
It was alright, I didn't play

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
A ton of things, we have

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
The new mod games going for Grand Theft Auto

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
So we've been playing that this week

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
It's weird though, we've been running into a bunch of

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Strange glitches and I'm not really sure

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
What it's from, I think it might be

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Some leftover data that's in the save files

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Or something, but

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
We have it set to all of our

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Cop cars are flying around and stuff

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
But for some reason when we're playing

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
The single player game, some of the cop cars

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Don't fly, so it makes me think

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
That some of the old data is in there

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
And then also we've been having issues

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
With cars disappearing on us

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
So it'll look like we're flying around

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
And we're impervious to fire in free mode

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
For some reason, and it's odd

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Because I didn't even touch any of those files

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
That would affect that, so

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
It's just a bunch of strange glitches

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
But I'm working on it

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
And then other than that

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
I played a little bit of

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
What did I play this week actually?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Oh, I tried a bit of

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Angry Birds because I've had it

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Purchased on my

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
iPod for the longest time now

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
And I gotta admit, I don't

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I don't understand it, I don't understand what the

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Big draw is, it's alright, it's

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Kind of fun, but

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I got bored of it really quick

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
So I don't know why everyone's

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
So gung-ho about it and like

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Have this big raging heart on for the game

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Because it's not that great

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm not sure I understand America's

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Obsession with Angry Birds either

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
It's okay, it's

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
For an iPhone game, it's fine

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
But it's not something like, oh my god

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
It's gotta warrant movie rights

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And shit like that

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And shirts, I went into Hot Topic the other day

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
There's Angry Birds shirts now

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Like really?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I thought Cut the Rope was cuter

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Because I like the om nom nom

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I just don't get it, I mean

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I don't know, like

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I've played a lot of addictive games

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
If anything, I think Plants vs. Zombies

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Serves more of

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
You know, movie rights and that kind of stuff

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Versus, you know, stupid

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Angry Birds

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I'd rather have Angry Birds shirts than

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Farmville bottled water

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And hot dogs, which is very real

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
At 7-Eleven, so

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah, that's a bit absurd though

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
For a casual game like that

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And then other things I played this week

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I just realized it's my move

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
In Words with Friends

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Which is a much more addicting iPhone game

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Than Angry Birds

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I'll tell you, the only thing that pisses me off

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
About Words with Friends is people that start random games with me

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Because I guess there's no way to like

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Take your name out of the random game pool

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
And I'm like, I don't want to play games with people I don't know

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
You know?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Especially things like Scrabble

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And then there's a chat feature in it

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Like, you know, don't talk to me

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
My friends at work have been consumed by Words with Friends

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So I have yet to play that

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
There was some other stuff that I played that was kind of cool

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
I've just been downloading a bunch of random things

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I actually downloaded today

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
It was kind of cool

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Earth Defense Force

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Not the Earth Defense Force that I've

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Come to love

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
But the old Earth Defense Force game

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
That was on

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
The Super Nintendo

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Which I think came out over here

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I want to say UN Squadron

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I think was the name of it over here

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Oh god, I loved UN Squadron

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
The old it?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
That was a Capcom game years ago

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I think that's the one

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
It looks similar, I could be wrong

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I think it's that game

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
But then there was another one I downloaded

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Raptor Call of Shadows

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Which is an old shareware game

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
From way back in the day

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
From Apogee

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
So that was pretty sweet

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
So I downloaded that

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
What else did I play?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Funny enough I was actually playing some

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Technically I guess it's a game

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Because it's an app and it's

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Questions

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
But I've been playing the

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And I don't know why I'm obsessed with this now

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
The Mensa

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Test quiz

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Type stuff on there

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Because I guess I scored pretty high on the website thing

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
So now I'm actually going to try

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I'm a Mensa member

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
I'm really smart you guys

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I'm not a member

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I have to take the test

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I can be a certified

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Genius that way, no?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Ray Ayanami in our chat room says

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Area 88 slash UN Squadron

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
NACDEF says UN Squadron does not equal

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Earth Defense Force

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
It just looks similar

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
I know there's something else I played

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I think I may have played a little bit of Swords and Poker

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
That's pretty fun

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I haven't really been doing a whole ton of gaming

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Mainly Grand Theft Auto

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Mainly Grand Theft Auto

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Oh, and actually I did try

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
There was a video that was out earlier this week

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Of people playing Grand Theft Auto

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Where they had the cars

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Didn't really have any

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Friction on them

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
So they just kind of went wacky

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And started flying around

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Everywhere and it's very chaotic

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
So I actually have my PC game set up like that

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Right now

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
It was something I was going to be trying out

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Even before I saw that video

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
There was this guy

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Who goes by the name Shadow on the boards

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
That I'm on that he did that

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
And there was another mod that he did that was kind of funky

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Like that

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I'm actually probably going to apply those to the

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Ballet of the Gay Tony stuff

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
We've only been playing Lost in Damned

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
So it'd be fun to

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Add that to it

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And then also apparently they're going to be releasing

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Script editing tools soon

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Which just opens up the realm of possibilities

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
For Grand Theft Auto modding to

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
All sorts of crazy lengths

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I mean because if we have access to

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Edit the scripts we can pretty much

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Do whatever we want in the game

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Which is pretty awesome so

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I'm very excited to see what comes of that

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
That's about it

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Alright

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
SalaciousPop how was your gaming week?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
What kind of games did you play this week?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
My gaming week is pretty embarrassing

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Not much to talk about

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Lots of wow

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You want me to talk about that at length

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I'll go on your other podcast

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
So just leveling up my main

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
And doing Cataclysm stuff

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I got a 1600 point

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Gift card for XBLA

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And I finally used it for Christmas

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
So I finally used it and I picked up the

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Scott Pilgrim game

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
The River City Ransom clone

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
So I tinkered with that a bit

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
And then I also used it to get

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
The Pac-Man Championship Edition DX

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And I also

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Have played some

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Plants vs. Zombies

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Game of the Year edition

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Which was left over from the Steam sale

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
When I picked it up for like 4 bucks

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Over Christmas and then

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Poker Night at the inventory

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And I'm now 60 grand in the hole

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Again in my global stat

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So I need to win 2 rounds

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
So that's frustrating

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Have you unlocked everything in your Poker Night game yet?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I still have lots of table tops and card decks

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
To unlock, about 4 left of each

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I know Bobby

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
The man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
He talked at length tonight about

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Back to the Future, the new Telltale

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Game that came out. Do you have any interest in

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Back to the Future games?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I haven't played any of the Sam & Max

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
And I loved the original one when it was on the

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
SCUMM engine, so all of the Telltale

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Episodic ones, I haven't

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Really messed with those at all

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
And there's also

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
The

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
The episodic game that I'm really looking forward to

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Isn't Telltale, sadly, but it's the Penny Arcade one

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Precipice of Darkness

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
On their website

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
They wrote the third volume

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
As an actual

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Like they wrote it out like a fanfiction

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
So I guess the third one was just

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Scrapped because they wrote it out instead

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Like a book

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
They had the first game and the second game

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
It was kind of a back and forth thing

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Because I remember reading some things about it

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Where there was a joke on Twitter

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
About, you know, if so many people

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Will buy this game when it's discounted, then we'll make the third game

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
And the Penny Arcade guys basically came out and said

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Actually, that's not true. There's not going to be a third game

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Basically. I don't know if it's a sales thing

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I completely missed when that was made official

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
All this time for the last three years, I was like

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
When are we getting volume three?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
But they just wrote it. Sorry. Oh, alright.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Alright, so that's all

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Fans vs. Zombies and

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Poker Night. It's kind of like when a show on TV

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Gets cancelled and you can like

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Maybe the producer will write something on the internet

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Or you can watch the rest of the episodes

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
On CBS.com or whatever

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
When you desperately hope that they

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Were able to squeeze out two or three

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Episodes to wrap it up

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
After they get cancelled, it's like, no

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
The seventh episode is it. There's no closure at all

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
What was that freaking show I actually

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Watched? I think it was

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Harper's Island or something. It was on TV

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
It was like a murder mystery

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Somebody dies every week and I think it got cancelled

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
By CBS like halfway through and he had to finish

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Watching it on CBS.com

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And it was actually

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Not that good of a show. I don't know why I

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Watched it every week and it had

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Kind of a crappy, guessable ending but whatever

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Probably the same reason we watched the Tester

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Probably, probably. Hey

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You know what, actually the Tester, the second

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Season of the Tester was probably a little better

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Than Harper's Island and less predictable

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Sadly

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
There you go

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
All sorts of embarrassing TV shows

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Speaking of embarrassing fandom, I will say the Telltale

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Game I'm actually looking forward to is Jurassic Park

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Like I'm really curious to see what they

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Do with it. It's such a weird license

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
In some ways for them to have

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
But I'm kind of excited to see kind of what they do with it

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Do you guys remember like the Jurassic Park games

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
From what they had on Super Nintendo

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Remember the Super Nintendo Jurassic Park game?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
It was all, yeah it was kind of cool

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
But at the same time it was a little

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Bit junky, I mean

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I remember two games that came out

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Both platformers that were night

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
And day between the Super Nintendo

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And Genesis versions

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
And it was completely different

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And Aladdin, when people put on Aladdin

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
For the Genesis it's like, this is amazing

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
And Jurassic Park was the same way

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Way better on the Genesis

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah, Jurassic Park, well I believe Jurassic Park you had to play

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
The dinosaur, it was like, wasn't that kind of

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
The trick to it? You could play the dinosaur

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Or you could play the doctor

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And it was kind of a cool thing

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Super Nintendo 1 had more of like

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
A Zelda-esque overworld

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And I use that term very loosely

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
But then when you would go into the caves

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
The dungeons were DOOM basically

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
But it was kind of like

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
You know, at that time we didn't have a lot of

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
First person shooter type games

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And I believe it was one of the earliest games to use surround sound

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
So you know, if you had a pretty good surround system

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
That game was really kind of scary

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
You know, at least for a kid

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Who was playing on the Super Nintendo

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
So, anyhow, we'll stop talking about

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Games from 15 years ago

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
And talk about something a little more current

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
My Gaming Week, sadly not a lot of

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
New stuff, you know again mostly

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Wow and My World as well

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Still playing a little bit of Fallout 3

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
As well as some other miscellaneous things here and there

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Not a lot of new stuff I tried out

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I did kind of go to the Indie Store

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
And I tried a few games on the Xbox Live Indie Game Store

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Because you know, there's some gems out there once in a while

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
You'll find some

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
And I always feel bad giving games on the Indie Store

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Negative reviews because

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
You know, we do an independent thing here

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
And I feel like we should support other independent games

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
But sometimes there's just games

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I really have a hard time justifying

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
And one of them is this game called

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Maids with Balloons, have you seen this game?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
On the Xbox Live Indie

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Marketplace

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I don't know how to explain it

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
It looks like a bad CD-ROM

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Game from like when CD-ROM

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Would first came out where they

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Did these full motion movies

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Or whatever and it looks like these

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Guys who made the game rented a room

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
At Motel 6 and got their friends

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
To dress up in maid outfits

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And just act out these scenes

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Pay them in drinks

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Didn't even pay them in cash

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
They got their three cute girlfriends to dress in maid outfits

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
And pay them in drinks

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And it was like, Skidamax movies

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Have more plot than this thing did

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And then you go into the game itself

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
And it's like you're trying to launch balloons

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Up at seagulls

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
So they don't poop on you

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
It's a really terrible shooter from

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
The 80s, Atari 2600 caliber

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
If someone submitted this game

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
To Newgrounds it would get blammed

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And make it to the Flash Portal

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
It belongs on Newgrounds

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
It was funny, just how bad it was

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And then they had the whole like pouting thing

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
At the end, oh they didn't buy the game

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Because they don't like us or whatever

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
And I'm just thinking, wow

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
This was somebody's fantasy project

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I can't even

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
But there's guys with maid fetishes

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
That'll have a field day with this

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Have fun

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I guess this is kind of a

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Lights off, pants down kind of game for you guys

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Anyhow, other indie games

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
That are worth much more of your time

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
For checking out was the

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
You have to help me remember the name of this game

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
It was Cthulhu Saves the World

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Which is by the same guys that did Breath of Death

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
7

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Which I have yet to play

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Obviously they love their old school

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
RPGs and I mean like Dragon Warrior

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
On the NES

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Style games or you know like

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Original Fantasy Star

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
So it's kind of like throwing back to the 8-bit days

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Cthulhu Saves the World is cute because it definitely

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Uses some of that tongue in cheek humor

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Where as the

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Narrator is talking, Cthulhu's like

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I can hear you

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
It's kind of a cute little premise

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
The game itself

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I don't know, like going back to

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Really old games like Dragon Quest and

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Fantasy Star, they feel a little more

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Grind fest to me now

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Than they used to

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
So I don't know, the game itself, they tried to do some

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Neat new things with the battle system for like combo

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Encounters and things like that but

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Oh and the other thing I got to say I like

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
They had this whole system where the

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Most number of random battles

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
You'll ever get into in a dungeon is 25

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
But if you want to fight

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
More random encounters, you can go to the main

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Menu and select fight

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
And it's kind of like you will purposefully go into another

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Random encounter fight, that's a really

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Neat kind of system, like somebody really kind of thought

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
That one out, like how to

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Make it, you remember like there'd be certain

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Dungeons in Final Fantasy games

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
That every two steps was like walk walk

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Like random battle comes in

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Right and it would get really annoying

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I thought that was kind of a neat way to

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Make sure that it's always going to be a little bit

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Consistent and not become too cumbersome

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
And once you hit your cap, you're done

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
You can just explore the cave all you want and not worry

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
About any more surprises

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
So yeah, I thought that was

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
It has some neat ideas, so I like

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
That it's trying to take that really old 8-bit

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Idea and make it better

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
It still felt a little bit like a Grind fest

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
To me, but the humor in the game

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Makes it, I think, a little more

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Bearable and makes you kind of

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Curious what joke they're going to tell next

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
So, and especially for the price

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Because you know, indie games are very reasonably priced

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
240 Microsoft points, that's what, 3 bucks?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
As much as you pay for something in the game room

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I'd say, heck yeah, why not?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Go do it. I was really impressed by

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
The soundtrack in Cthulhu

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Saves the World. It did have a good soundtrack. Amazing soundtrack

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
And yeah, it was pretty funny when he

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
One of the first things you do is you

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Rescue sort of a damsel in distress

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
On the beach

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And you save her and Cthulhu is like

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
So am I a hero now?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And the narrator's like, you're the Dark Lord of

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
The Eldritch, like hell no

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Saving a girl isn't going to cut it

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
We need a little bit more from you

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
And that was kind of funny how it's very sarcastic

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
And she has a big crush on him

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Yeah, she falls in love with him with his big tentacle mouth

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
She's like, oh you are so fine

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Aren't you just waiting for the Uosugdoji scene

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
To come happen?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
That's unpleasant

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
But I do want to keep playing just to see

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
If that happens

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Although I think games on the marketplace

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Can't be too adult

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Although somehow this

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Borderline innuendo made game

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Gets on the marketplace

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I mean granted, there's no titty

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
The game would have been ten times better

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
If there were boobs

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
There was one with titty in it

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Was that the guy game?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Was that for the PS2?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
On the indie games or whatever

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And it was some chick or whatever

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Like this guy's girlfriend

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
She wasn't like supermodel

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
It was just

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Some normal chick

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
That they had her in lingerie

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
And that game got yanked

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Really quick though

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Unfortunately

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Now that we've had maids with balloons

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I'm just waiting for furries

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
With guns

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I can't wait for there to be the furry porn game

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
On Xbox Live

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I'm kind of surprised it hasn't hit yet

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And then there could be furries with guns

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Versus maids with balloons

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Crazy, so there you go

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
By the way, I just got a text message

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
From Miss Dark Sakura

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
She's gonna be here in two hours

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I don't know if she's gonna make it

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
She's just barely gonna hit the end of the show

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
If she gets here

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
She can do her cage match

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
That's not even the podcast part

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Trying to think of anything else

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I want to say there was one other game I had tried

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Oh, the cute little arcade game

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
The Rascals, was that what it was called?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
The skulls?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Yeah, with the skulls that was kind of like Mr. Driller

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
It was Mr. Driller meets

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You know what it was? The Mario Brothers

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Game on Game Boy Color

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Did you ever play that?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Where you could link the systems

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And race Mario and Luigi to beat the level

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
As fast as possible

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Did you ever play that?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Okay, well somebody took that idea

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
And made like a game out of it

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Where basically you race

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
It's a little platformer where you're trying to get

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
From start to finish as fast as possible

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
And then there's this whole Mr. Driller element

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
With the colored blocks that you dig through

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Kind of thrown in as well

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
So yeah, if you're like a fan of the old school

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
8-bit platformer games

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Especially Mario Brothers type

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
It's cute

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Some weird

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Plot devices they use

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I didn't get the whole opening

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
With the ship and the rats

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I get that they're supposed to be the antagonists

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
But I don't know

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I think this game just needed to kind of throw me in

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
And start playing

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I didn't need all the exposition in the beginning

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It was a little weird

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
But the game's cute

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
It's definitely worth checking out the demo if you like

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Either old school games or you like platformer games

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
You can kind of make your decision from there

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Because the demo's pretty robust

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
So you can check that out

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
That's pretty much it though

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
For my gaming week otherwise

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Not a whole lot else to report on

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
So I'll just talk housekeeping real quick

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
We are still here

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Moving towards our 400th show

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Set for the first week of February

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
We're tossing around some ideas internally

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Nothing yet

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I don't think it's going to be too big of a deal

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
We've had enough self-serving anniversary episodes

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Amongst our 9 year run

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
We plan to do something a little bit special

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Actually right now we're talking

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Trying to bring back something the listeners

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Have been asking for for a very long time

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
And I'll leave it at that

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
We're going to hopefully debut that back on episode 400

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
And I'll let you all speculate what that is

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Otherwise other housekeeping things

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Join us on Twitter

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Twitter.com slash OLR

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Or you can follow us on Facebook

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
At Orange Lounge Radio

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
How about some news

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
We've got a lot of it tonight

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It was surprisingly a busy week

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I guess now the holidays have officially

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Been out and people are back at work

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
We're getting back into some gaming news

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
For what's going to happen through the summer of this year

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
And we start tonight with Loki

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Ah yes

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
And speaking of people being busy

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
No one's been busier than Sony

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And their legal team

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
They've been spending the week

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Suing hackers

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
For hacking the Playstation 3

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Two groups of course

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
That they were going after

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Fail Overflow

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
The hacking group that

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
During a recent conference was talking about

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
How they've basically

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Found all the

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Public keys and were able

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
To fully open up

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
The system for

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Homebrew and whatnot

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
And then of course

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
The famous in the iPhone scene

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
GeoHot

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Or George Hot

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
He was the one that actually pioneered

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
The jailbreak for the iPhones

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And um

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
You know later on

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Went to release the keys

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
For the Playstation 3 hacking

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Um

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And yeah they're not too pleased by it

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Of course

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
They're saying

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
According to the court documents

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
The hack violates the DMCA

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
And the already pirated games are being

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Packaged and distributed with these

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Circumvention devices

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Which by the way is not true

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
And then

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Um

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Of course George Hot

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Made a comment about that

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I would expect the company that prides itself on intellectual property

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
To be well versed in the provisions

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Of the law so I'm disappointed

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
In Sony's current action

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I have spoken with legal counsel

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
And I'm comfortable that Sony's action against me

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Doesn't have any basis

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Well of course it's going to continue on from there

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Um

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
So here's how it kind of played out this week

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
GeoHot on his website

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Actually put the keys

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Out there so people had access

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
To them as well as

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Various signing tools

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And samples of possible ways to

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Install and run homebrew

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Of course you know

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
None of this actually has anything to do with

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Pirating games it's just

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Installing homebrew and in fact

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
There are some limitations to what he's already

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Released

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
To not allow

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Pirating games

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
At least yet

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Um

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Then it's kind of funny

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
There's just all sorts of stuff going on

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Um

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Try to go a little bit more in detail here

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
So

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
There's a few funny things that are kind of going on

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
About this whole court case to begin with

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
One

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Sony decided you know

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
To I guess

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Get evidence that

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Hotz was accepting money

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Donations

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Basically saying that oh he was charging

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
People for these exploits

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
They actually sent him a dollar to his

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Paypal account Sony did

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Which is kind of weird

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
And of course you know

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Hotz's attorney they're saying

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Hotz has not produced a manufacturer sold

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Nor does he have

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Any intent whatsoever to produce manufacturers

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Sell any devices that facilitate piracy

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
And

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
They're saying that

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Basically it

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Dismisses Sony's

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Use of piracy case

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
For precedent because the case

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Involves hardware use to circumvent

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
PSC's protection not

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Software

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
That is weird that Sony sent him a dollar

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I mean I understand it was probably for the purposes of

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Putting together their argument or whatever

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Like they had to do it to kind of like

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
You know

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
There's a lot of weird stuff going on

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
In more detail where it doesn't even make any sense

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Sure okay

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Because the whole court case is going down in San Francisco

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And you might think

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Well that's you know doesn't sound

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Too strange but this guy

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Actually resides in New Jersey

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Totally out of his jurisdiction

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Yeah but Sony's in San Francisco

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Aren't they?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I understand that but they're taking the case up against him

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
They have to do it in his jurisdiction

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
But their thing is basically

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
That he communicated on Twitter

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
He communicated over

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
You know

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Using PayPal or something like that

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And those two companies reside in Northern California

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
So therefore

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Is this a copyright or trademark

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Issue that they're going for?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
No they're going for the fact that he released their public keys

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Okay

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Because I know anything to do with

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
With copyright or trademark

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Or whatever is federal

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
So then you can intentionally file the

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Claim out of state to make the person

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Drag their ass to the court where you filed it to

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Well they basically did that

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Kind of

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
One of the comments they're saying is

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I think it's quite telling that Sony

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Who legally is required to provide

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Notice to Mr. Hotz before seeking any special

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Relief with the court decided to

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Email Mr. Hotz a copy of their motion

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
At 7pm when a

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Hearing was scheduled for the next morning at 9am

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
In California while Mr. Hotz doesn't

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Even live in California

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Sony's seeking various unreasonable reliefs

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Seizing Mr. Hotz personal property

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
And computers

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Luckily the courts postpone the hearing

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
And this is just

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
They have a bunch of comments from different law firms

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Well I'm pretty sure it's just you know the big company

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Exercising their big company muscle

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
To try and squelch out this guy

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Who has very limited resources I'm sure

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Even if they don't have a case they're basically saying

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Hey buddy you're gonna spend money on a

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Plane ticket to drag your ass out here to defend yourself

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Well here's what it is

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
And you have to understand there's more

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
This is bigger than just

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
This a hacker

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
You know hacking Sony stuff

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
What this does is sets precedent for

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
A few things

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
There is similar cases that went on

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
When the whole jail breaking

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Of the iPhone thing happened

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
And that actually

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Was overturned in courts and now it is

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Legal to jail break

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Your phone because of that

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Court case well this

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Interesting comparison I never thought

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Of that sorry I just had to get that out there but I didn't

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Realize you're right

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
What this story is is very similar

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
To the whole jail breaking your iPhone

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
It's using your device not the way

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
The company intended but not necessarily

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
It's even going beyond that

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
The whole thing is

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Remember when you buy these consoles

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
In their end user license agreement

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
It's basically making it seem like

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
You're leasing this property

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
That is Sony's and they're

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Paying a fee to basically lease it

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
So literally it's their property but it's in your home

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
This would actually set precedent

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
That this is your console

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
You can do whatever the fuck you want with it

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
If he ends up winning this case

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Is what it's going to come down to

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I wonder how that would impact the next generation

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Of games and the reason why I say that

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Is that you know why that's in there is because

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Companies take a big loss

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
On their consoles

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Even when the Playstation 3 came out for

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
What was it $700 when it first came out

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Sony was still taking a loss on those consoles

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Usually the manufacturers put out

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
The consoles at a loss

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Unless you're the Wii

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Was the one console that they weren't taking a loss on

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
But all these other consoles they take a loss

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Because they make the money back from the games

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
That are sold and all the licensing that comes from that

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
So if somehow

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
If suddenly this thing is unlocked

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
That you don't have to pay for games anymore

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Then this company is consistently

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Losing money every time a console is sold

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
So it's going to be interesting that the courts

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Come in and say well

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Obviously it is just like the jailbroken iPhones

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
You can use these consoles for whatever you want

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Is that going to drive the price

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Way up of the next series of consoles

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I don't think they can do that

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Well I mean they can do that obviously

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
But I don't think it would be smart for them to do that regardless

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Because a lot of people don't have the know-how

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
To do this

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Although

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
He went on G4

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And made a comment about what the whole case was going on

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
He doesn't feel that he's

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
In the wrong

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Obviously and

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
It's basically as simple as right now

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
If your console is not to the latest

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Firmware all you have to do is

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Download a firmware update that's on his website

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
And you can immediately download

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
That firmware, update your console

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
And boom there it is right there

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
The ability to install Homebrew

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
And that's on any console that's out there right now

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
And it's just, it's ridiculous

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
A few other things

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Real quick

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Can I read some comments from chat because obviously

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
This is a very un-passionate issue

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And some folks in the chat room are kind of lighting up about this

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Nick Gertz in our chat room

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I don't recognize that name so welcome if it's your first time

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
And our chat room says BS once you buy something it's yours

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
You should be able to do whatever the fuck you want

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
With what you own

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Read the end user license agreement

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
You may think that and you may feel that

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
And I agree it should be the case

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
But that's not what they're saying

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
That's why they're able to patch your

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
PlayStation 3 to remove the other operating system

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
And all that stuff

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
I definitely agree with Nick

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
That's going to be very interesting

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
And then SSJ100Matt in our chat room says

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Can't blame Sony for protecting its properties

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I think they sort of have an obligation to

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Because of

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
That agreement that they have with developers

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
That there's all these other companies

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
That if this whole thing ends up going

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Against Sony

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
They have an interest in that too

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Here's the problem though

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
This may be Sony's

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Big

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Weakness in this case

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Is that they're saying that this

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Enables piracy

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It hasn't enabled piracy yet

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
This is not something that's

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Well that's true but we're talking now

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
We're not talking about in the future

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
That's stupid

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Should Sony have waited and

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Tell piracy was a factor?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Here's the other thing too

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Geohot has only released

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And this is all speculation

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
He's only released a portion

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Of the key

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Basically he has a

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
A key for signing these applications

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
That you create in homebrew

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
It's one key though

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
There's a key generator though

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
That they have to generate these keys

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
That can be used to sign these different applications

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
But he hasn't released a generator

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
He's only released a single key

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
So in theory Sony could just ban that key

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
And all the homebrew stuff wouldn't work anymore

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
But he's smart you see

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Because he's hoping this court case

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
In favor, if that's the case

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Then it'll be legal for him to release that key

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
And it's over, it's done

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
There's nothing they can do

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Once that's out there, there is no way to block that

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Anymore, they're done

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
It's over

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
SalaciousPop you want to say something and then I'll go to more chat comments

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Yeah this is really just about

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Opening up additional functionality

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
On a console that you own

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
If it was some type of hack

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Where I don't know you could pull games

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Down from the Playstation network

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Or that was a demo

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
And unlock it

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Completely different thing I'm talking about here

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Where you could then play the full version of the game without paying for it

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Then yes, that's something that would hurt the developer

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
But that's completely different

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
That's not what we're dealing with here

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
It's just opening up the console for

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Homebrew and whatever else

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Now granted everyone doesn't necessarily share

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
That same ideal

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
There's people out there that's like

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Okay how can I use this, the pirate stuff

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Oh yeah

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
This is one hacker they're going after

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
This is not the whole hacking community

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
It's one guy

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
He's not going for piracy

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
So the fact that they're saying

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
He's releasing tools to

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Enable piracy

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Yeah in the long run maybe

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
But you could say

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Well you release the console that enables piracy

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Because eventually

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
There will be piracy on it

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
And just think if they would have just kept Linux on the damn system

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Maybe people wouldn't have gone here

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
I'm convinced that most of the hardcore people

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
In the crypto and DRM

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Communities that love breaking that stuff

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Don't even play games

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
They're like this is an awesome thing

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
It's got awesome DRM on it, I want to break it

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Because that's fun as hell

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It's funny they're asking him

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
So what's something

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Once this whole PS3 thing is done

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
What's your next thing, what are you going to move on to next

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
What's your next

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Because he stopped doing the iPhone stuff

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Because he got bored with it

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
That's all it was

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
And this guy he's like 21 years old

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
21 year old

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
And so he got bored with

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Whatever it was and he's like

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Well I hear the PSP2 is coming out

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Let me go to the other comments from chatroom

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Chat.orangelandrater.com

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Can I put end user license agreements on other things in life

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Like the door to my house

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Maybe

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
SpazinatorPC says

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
If I ever mess with my system

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
I'd be too afraid of bricking it

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Thus losing my video content that I bought

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
That's kind of where I'm at

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
A little bit

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
I really don't have a good reason

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
To hack my system

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Me personally

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Because I don't really want to

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Pirate everything

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I don't know

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
There's limits and I think that's a bit much

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Then we won't have games anymore

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
If everybody goes batshit crazy about pirating

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
But you know

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I don't know I'd be afraid

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Of some of this other stuff

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Of just screwing my console

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Especially 360

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I have lots of XPLA games I've bought

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Like over 100

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
It's pretty disgusting

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Of course I've had my console for 4 or 5 years now

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Yeah I don't want to lose that

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
So I'm afraid to do anything that might even

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Get my console banned or lose me access

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
To all that crap you know what I mean

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I haven't been into

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Chipping or modding systems since the PS1

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
And the Dreamcast

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
After that era I stopped

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Doesn't mean I'm not still interested in that community

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
But just as far as

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
The consoles have just gotten too expensive

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
For me to open it up

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I'm not a whiz with a soldering iron

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
As I once was so I'd probably brick the hell out of it

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
But yeah

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I find these stories really interesting

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
But I haven't been into modding or any of that stuff in a while

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I would say I would support

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Trying to get around region locking

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
And that kind of made me think about that

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Ray Iannami says I could have hacked my US 360

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Then I would have had to get a Japanese one

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Or then I wouldn't have had to get a Japanese one

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
And that kind of made me think you know yeah

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Getting around region locking I think

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I don't understand region locking

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
I do

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
I understand why they do it

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
That doesn't mean I support it

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I know it's coming up later in the show

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Let's not forget

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
And I know somebody is going to say it if I don't

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
PS3 of course is not region locked

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
That's good though

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Here's what comes down to it

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I think that when you

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Remove functionality like that

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
It's not even necessarily removing it because a lot of the consoles in the past

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Did not have, they weren't region free

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
But nonetheless

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
If you remove

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Or do not have features like it being

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Region free

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
I think if it wasn't region free

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
That'd give more people motivation to try to hack it

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
To make it region free

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Just like we're going to get into another system

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
That's region free

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I really

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
You don't want to give them more

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Excuses to try to hack your system

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And in the PS3 actually

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I think that's why it's taken so long

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
It's because it had Linux enabled on it

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
From the beginning

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
And it was region free

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Why do you need to hack the system?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Because most people are trying to install homebrew

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Or play stuff from other regions

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
So it's all there

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Well they didn't remove the region locking

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
They removed Linux

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
And once they removed Linux

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
People took interest in trying to get that back

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Because people don't like things

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
That are taken away from them

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I just want to throw it out there

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
If the Wii wasn't region locked

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
We could have totally made President and Cat sell more than 100 copies

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Just saying

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
If you remember that whole debacle from like 2 years ago

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
2 years ago?

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It's about at least a year and a half

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Not 2 years ago

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
It was a while

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I found it interesting that dude was on

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Attack of the show and all this stuff

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
He's become this e-list celebrity now

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
He's big in the

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Iphone community

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
He came up with the jailbreak stuff

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
That's pretty big

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Alright

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Let me go to some other stories here

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Kind of getting into other

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Legal-ish type of things

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Although I don't think this is going to end up being a lawsuit

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
There was this whole back and forth

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Between Capcom Mobile

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
This week and the folks that made

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Explosion Man

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Twisted Pixel

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
And it has to do with the game Maxplosion

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Which came out for the Iphone

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Which of course was released to iTunes

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Very similar to Explosion Man

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Both feature Little Red Demons

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Kind of running around

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
They're even similar names

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Doing similar things

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Yeah

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Capcom Mobile took a little bit of heat this week

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
For doing that

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
So much that the Twisted Pixel programmer

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Mike Henry on his Twitter account said

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Quote, Maxplosion gameplay

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Video makes me sad

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
If you're going to outright steal a game

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
You should at least understand what makes it fun

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Another note to this is that Twisted Pixel

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Had actually once met with Capcom

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
About getting them to distribute

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Explosion Man

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Capcom passed

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
So for them to do something like this was especially insulting

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Well Capcom had to put out some fires of their own

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
They of course were

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Sadened by the whole situation

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Let me tell you how sad in this little statement

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Quote, while Twisted Pixel did have

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Discussions with our console game team

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
About publishing Explosion Man on game consoles

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Capcom Mobile is a different division

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Of Capcom with separate offices

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
And as such had no prior knowledge

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Of any meetings between the console game team

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
And Twisted Pixel

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Maxplosion was developed independently by Capcom Mobile

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Nonetheless we are saddened by this

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Situation and hope to rebuild the trust

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Of our fans and friends

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
In the gaming community

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
We're sorry

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
We're sorry

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I like how it completely dodges the fact

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
That the game is a total

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
You know, I don't want to say rip off

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
But heavily influenced

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
By Explosion Man

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
You know what I mean?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
That press release totally dodges

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
That part of it

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Well Capcom Mobile, they have different employees

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
And they're in a different building

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Than Capcom

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
They wouldn't work with Capcom console people

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
At all, I mean god

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
They wouldn't be working with those teams

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
When they port over their crappy ports of games

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Onto the iPhone or whatever

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Thank you for Dead Rising with four zombies in it

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
So you're telling me

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
That these people have no communication

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
That's like the whole Coke Zero

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Coke thing

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
I think people are reading

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
A little too much into what Twisted Pixel said

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Believe it or not

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
I believe Capcom

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
I think a lot of times these big companies

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Especially international companies

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Tend to work in little silos

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And I don't think

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
That the Capcom division said one to another

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Hey, we got presented this little game

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
You guys should try it

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
I don't think that ever happened

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Here's what I think did happen

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Explosion Man's been out for a good six months now

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I think some people in the mobile division played it

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
And said we want to do a game like this on the iPhone

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
I honestly don't think

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
It was ever one of those

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Don't make it shadier than it already is shady

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
You know what I mean?

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
But let's face it folks

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I look at this and I go

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
This is news, really

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Games ripping each other off

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
That's been happening forever

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
And especially on the iPhone

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Hello Gameloft

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I mean, ironically enough

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Street Fighter 2

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
How many times was that game ripped off?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
It got a lot of shoddy ports done to it

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
This show started

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Then a game came out called In the Groove

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
And there was much heated debate

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
About what a ripoff In the Groove was

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Games biting from one another

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Happen all the time

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
It happens in movies too, you guys

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
A lot of movies are ripoffs of one another

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
It's not that surprising

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
It's up to the gamers

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
To reject the crap

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And if you think that this is

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
A crappy derivative of Explosion Man

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Don't buy it

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Don't support the ripoff

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Don't buy it

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
It's cute, I guess, in some ways

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
That Capcom's being called out on this

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
But I really don't think Capcom's alone

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
In what they're doing

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I think every game company out there is guilty of doing it at some point

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Name me a company

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I'm sure there's a ripoff game they've done at some point

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I can't think of any

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Anyway

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I'm not taking that literally

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I'm not trying to profess to be this encyclopedia

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
But I'm sure most big companies

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
At one point or another

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Have ripped off another game

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Or allowed a game to heavily influence

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
What they're doing

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
And yeah, some comments from our chatroom here

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Darktitsia says Great Gianna Sisters

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Well, you know

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
That ended up getting pulled from shelves

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
So I was a little too close

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
And it's coming out in DS in February

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Yeah, but it's all different now

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
One of the great things about Great Gianna Sisters

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Actually, if you want to go way back

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Great Gianna Sisters was a game

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
That came out for

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
The Commodore 64

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
And it really looked and felt like Mario

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Especially like the first level

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Blue sky

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Bricks on the ground

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Goomba looking monsters

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Bricks that turned into coins

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I mean, damn

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
It was really, really just like Mario

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Little power-ups that make you get bigger

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
It really was pretty much a Mario Brothers ripoff

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Ironically enough, when you get into later levels

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
There are some kind of different mechanics

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
That do set the game apart a little bit

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
But here's the thing

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
The reason why people remember that game so fondly

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
It wasn't necessarily the game itself

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
But it had a kick-ass soundtrack

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
If you've ever heard the soundtrack to Great Gianna Sisters

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
And a lot of the Commodore 64 music

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
You still hear that influence today

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I mean, Chiptune, bit music

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
All of it is influenced by Commodore 64 stuff

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
All of it

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
And so there was such great music

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
That came out of that Commodore 64 era

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Great Gianna Sisters I think is fondly remembered

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Because, yeah, it was a ripoff of a game

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
It had an awesome soundtrack

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Dark Tetsuya also brings up Casey Munchkin

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Which was an Odyssey game

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
That was a total ripoff of Pac-Man

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Game Guru says

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Capcom even sued for Fighter's History

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
But that time they lost

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
It's kind of interesting what games are considered too close

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
And what games aren't

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
ActDeft, by the way, in our chatroom

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Says, Loki, I know a guy that works at Gameloft

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
He pretty much has told some friends

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
And me that they pretty much ripoff games

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
And just make some cosmetic changes

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Gameloft had a Castlevania Symphony of the Night ripoff

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
They were going to release a few years ago

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
But they cancelled it

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
But here's the thing, though

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
But, you know

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
To Gameloft's credit

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Some of their games are actually pretty good

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
I mean, granted, they're not the most original thing

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
But damn, you know

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
For what it's running on

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
It's pretty good

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Problem is, when they go to

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Develop on consoles

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
They don't really learn that, okay

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I can't put out a

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Well, you can put out a Modern Warfare 2

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Clone, but

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
No one's going to give a shit

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Because it's on consoles now

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
It's not as impressive as making it run on the

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
You know, iPhone or whatever

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
But yeah, their boards, I mean, or whatever

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Aren't, they aren't terrible

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I mean, I haven't played all of them

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
But

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
They look, compared to like

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Hungry bird clones and stuff like that

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
It could be a lot worse

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Funny enough, if Gameloft had put out

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
A version of Splosion Man, do you think it would've

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Necessitated all these stories on Gamelogs

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
This week? Nope

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
It was funny, though, because they did have

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
A story, they didn't make our show roll

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
But Gameloft was saying

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
We don't rip games off

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
There's just a limited amount of genres

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
That we can use, so a lot of games

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Look similar

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
No

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I'm sorry, that is a bunch of shit

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Do you know why this, I think, got

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Traction and is all over the news?

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Because it's Capcom, and they expect better from Capcom

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Exactly, because Capcom, I think

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Has always been seen as, they're one of us

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
They're friends with the community

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
They're letting the people

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Design Mega Man Legends 3, they're the

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Good guys. I'd expect better from Capcom

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
The console

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Game manufacturer

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Capcom Mobile, their stuff

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Is shit. That's true, the Mega Man game

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
On iPhone, shit. Absolute shit

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Dead Rising, terrible

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Devil May Cry

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
I haven't actually played it yet

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
But I'm sorry, it probably won't be good

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
So

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
No, I don't expect much better from

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Capcom Mobile

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Now Capcom, though, if they actually put out an

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Xbox Live Arcade game of Maxplosion

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Then I'd be a little sad

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Now you're acknowledging that they're separate divisions

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
This is what I'm saying

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Well, it's their words

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I don't think they're talking

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
To each other, to this extent

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
I don't think it's some mass conspiracy

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
The steel explosion, man

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
It's not anything like that

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
It's just

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
It's supposed to make crappy

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Games in their mobile department

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
What can I say?

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Alright, let's move on

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Who's accusing who of ripping

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Someone off next? And we'll go to another news

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Story from Salacious Pop

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Champions Online

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Which came out in September

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Of 09, some

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Brief 15-16 months ago

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Is going free to play

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I think Lord of the Rings Online

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Was the most recent major MMO to do this

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Champions Online

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Will be going free to play starting

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
January 25th

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
You can download the client and

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Create your superhero or your villain

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
And go along your crime fighting way

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
When it gets relaunched

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
On the 25th

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Getting a new title

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Champions Online Free-for-All

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Which sounds like it might be an expansion

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
But that's just what they're rebranding it

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
For the free-to-play model

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
This story is kind of

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Important to me simply because I

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Was a huge

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I was hugely cuckoo bananas over City of Heroes

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Played that for three years

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
And the team within Cryptic

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Studios that was working on City of Heroes

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Was spun off to

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Paragon Studios which is now its own thing

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Just for City of Heroes

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Because Cryptic got the Champions Online license

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
And it was going to be the first

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
MMO that had

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
PC and Xbox

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
360 support

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Where you could have an account

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
That worked on both

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Platforms

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
And a month or two before release

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Microsoft pulled the plug

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
On the Xbox Live component

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Of the MMO

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
When they launched they already had

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Potentially 50% of

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Their game base taken away from them

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
It became PC only

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
And it floundered, it never really took off

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
It kind of flopped actually

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
So this isn't surprising to me at all

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I'm surprised that they're actually going free-to-play

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
For me it would seem

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
That now they would be able to bring it

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
To Xbox Live

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Because before they had

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
For some reason the infrastructure with

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
MMOs and stuff and subscriptions

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Couldn't do it

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
I'm sorry but I call bullshit on Microsoft

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Final Fantasy XI came out like

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Six months after the Xbox was out

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
They were able to do this shit for years

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Well then why haven't there been any MMOs on the console yet?

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
That's a damn good question

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
One I think Microsoft needs to answer

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Final Fantasy XI did this shit

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
It was PC and 360 and

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
PlayStation 2 for fuck's sake

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
You know why I don't think there's been any MMOs?

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Because there haven't really been any MMOs on consoles yet

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
But now

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Sony releasing like DC Universe

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
And they're going to have the agency some year

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Final Fantasy XIV

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Well eventually Final Fantasy XIV

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
But if that stuff takes off

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
They're going to have to compete

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
But right now they had the MMO

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Sony didn't have anything

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
And so now

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Final Fantasy XI I don't think did too well

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
For them on 360

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Because it had already been out

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
It's hard to just

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
The audience that would have been attracted

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
To Final Fantasy XI already had it

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
On the PlayStation 2 or on the PC

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
There were just very few

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
You know as Salacious Pop says

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Cuckoo Bananas nerds for that game

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Like me and like you Loki

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
That bought it

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Because we had the PC version

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
But sometimes we wanted to play it on our TV

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
It did look really good on the TV

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
I'm not going to lie

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Like if I was still into playing Final Fantasy XI

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I'd probably be playing it on the 360

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Home where I just live by myself now

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
And I could be using my TV as a giant computer

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Like that I would totally be playing Final Fantasy XI

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
On the Xbox 360 if I was still

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Playing that game

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
It, it, it

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
You know if that game went free to play

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Yeah I got to admit if Final Fantasy XI

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Went free to play I'd go back

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I'd go back and if all my characters were still there

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
I'd be on like that I would download the client

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I'd be on tomorrow I would

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Not going to lie

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
That's scary, that's a scary thought

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
If you did that, bye bye 14

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
It doesn't even matter, don't even release it

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Just forget it, just don't even worry about it

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Just finish, keep adding to XI

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
When I tried to play

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
When I tried to play Champions Online last year

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
For like the free, when they

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Because they came out with a free trial

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Really relatively soon after the release

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Because it was a flop

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
I was doing the City of Heroes

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Thing playing with the controller and mouse

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Or not controller, with the keyboard and mouse

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Didn't like it, plugged in my

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Xbox 360 controller

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
And all of a sudden all of the buttons

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
And the configuration for the controller, the integration

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Was amazing, so you knew that

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
When this game came out

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
It had full, like it was ready to come out

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
On the Xbox, and even on the PC

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Version you plug in an Xbox controller

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
And you can see how much better the game

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Is with an Xbox controller

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
That's kind of how I feel about DC Universe

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Ironically enough these two games somewhat similar

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
In the whole like super hero in the making thing

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I wonder if this happening

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Is somewhat of a response to DC Universe

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Kind of now entering the market

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
And you know, it seems like quite a few

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
People are kind of jumping on board

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
And having played the beta test of the PC

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Version of DC Universe, man

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
It was so much better when I plugged in the controller

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
And did it that way

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
So you know, you download the client

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
And you create your free account, you can play

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
It's

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
It's adopting

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Sort of a freemium model

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Where if you want to pay for the additional

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Costume packs, or the weapons

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Or powers

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Or whatever, you can

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Pay a la carte for that

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
However, if you're into the game enough

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
That you're willing to pay a $14.99

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Subscription, which is what it is right now

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
You will automatically get that stuff as soon as

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
It's available, you'll have everything

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
So they're still offering

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
A subscription based

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Service for people that

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Are into the game enough that they want all the goodies

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Or you can just play it

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
You know, run

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Have it run with your WoW account

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Do the, if you see one particular

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Expansion that you like, pay for it a la carte

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
And otherwise it's free

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
So yeah, hopefully

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
This will help the game out, because I really like the

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Superhero genre

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
And this game, I feel, never really got

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
A chance to succeed

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Because of what Microsoft did too

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Speaking of the superhero genre

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Do you have any interest in DC Universe Online

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
That it's out?

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
This is gonna sound, I don't know if this is

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Pretentious or what, but just the fact that it's DC

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Like if Marvel came out with an MMO

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
I'd feel the same way

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
I just don't like the big names, I like the

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Because City of Heroes has a huge

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
RP community in it, because it's so

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Customizable

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
And it's not attached to any known

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
License, like DC is

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
But yeah, I'm gonna check this out now, now that it's free to play

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Champions Online, absolutely, I'm gonna get it

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Well you'll have to come back

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
And let us know how it is

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Yes

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Let's move on

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
So it's no surprise

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
That one of the best games

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
To be released for the Kinect

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Has sold 1 million units in the US

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
That would be Dance Central

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
And also Kinect Sports

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Both those games breaking the

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
1 million unit mark

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Of course the Kinect hardware

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Has sold 8 million units

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Worldwide

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
And also

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
It's kind of neat to mention

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
And I don't think a lot of people know this yet

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
But in case you haven't picked up Dance Central

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Or you're thinking of picking it up

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
You may want to wait a little bit

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Because they're actually going to be doing a new

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Skew that's going to be coming out to the market soon

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
That will give you, I guess, your first piece of

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Download content for free

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
It's going to include a code for

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
240 Microsoft points bundled into the box

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Ooh!

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Like $3 for free

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
That's nice, one free song or whatever

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Yeah, so

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
But yeah, the game is pretty awesome

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I have to actually go back and play it

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Now that I've got the living room

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I need to play more of this but my apartment

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Is too fucking small

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
It's kind of sad

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
But yeah, Dance Central is a fun time

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
And it's so funny because

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Last night I was out at the club

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
And they were playing actually

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
A couple songs that I recognized from Dance Central

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Like Evacuate the Dance Floor

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
So when Evacuate the Dance Floor started playing

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I actually kind of started doing this in my seat

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Evacuate the Dance

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I was doing the whole little dance from

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
The game

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
That's what that was, I just thought you were drunk

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
I didn't know, I had no idea

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
No, that was the dance from Dance Central

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
And like you and Rice Princess and Xtaphir

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I went out and got drunk with Xtaphir and Rice Princess

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
And Salacious Pop last night

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
And so you know

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
And Grandpa Warcraft for those who listen to Hoard House

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
That went out last night

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
We all went out and you know good times are had

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
And when that song came

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
And then what's the other song

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I hate that song so much

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I was doing the whole fist bumping thing

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I know you want me

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
I know I want you

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
If that song was released by

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Triumph the insult comic dog

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Then it would be amazing, but it's not

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
The routine is pretty fun though

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
The thing about Dance Central

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Is that as stinking cheesy as those dances are

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
You kind of start to remember them

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
After you play the game enough times

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
And I'm tempted to do it on the dance floor

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
That one's really weird

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
It's like a lot of jumping around

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Good times

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Something that won't be as easy to dance to

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
And you really really should not reenact

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
In real life at all

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
The kind of

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I guess you could say

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Very hard R rated

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Mortal Kombat

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Episodes that are going to be coming out soon

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Okay you might remember there was this little

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
YouTube clip some time ago

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
That was like a concept video

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
For a Mortal Kombat movie reboot

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
And it was like imagine if Mortal Kombat

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
When all saw Anya

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
And it was really violent

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
And some big names were in this

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Michael Jai White

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Michael Jai White was Jax and TitsOf9

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
What's her name?

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
She was Sonya

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Jerry Ryan was Sonya in this

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
And yeah

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Sadly they're not going to make it a movie

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
That's not happening but what is going to happen

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
There's going to be some webisodes

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
A 10 part Mortal Kombat webisode series

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I guess this is somewhat to promote

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
The new games that are coming out

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
So I wonder if that will somehow work together

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Michael Jai White is going to come back

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
As Jax

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
However the website Bloody Disgusting

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
That reported on this because that's a website all about

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
The gore movies basically

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
They didn't say a whole lot about the storyline

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
So I imagine this is all just a part to kind of like

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Pump up the release of the game

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
But we don't know a whole lot outside of that

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
So I guess it's neat

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
I'm not into the uber violence

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
You see like I like Mortal Kombat

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Because it's cartoony violence

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Like cartoony violence is funny to me

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
But I don't like the Saw movies

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Like that just crosses the line

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
To me

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
So I don't know how I feel about this whole thing

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Am I a hypocrite?

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
So let's just pop

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Am I a hypocrite because I like Mortal Kombat

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
But I don't like Saw

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
A little

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
A little bit I don't know

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I haven't really thought about it too much

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
One of them is cartoony though

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
I don't know it's different to me

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
We'll see

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Weiland in our chatroom says that Michael Jai White

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Has said those webisodes would lead into a movie

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Well I'm sure it would be better than the movie

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
That had come out before it

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Spazinator says anyone remember the short lived

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Mortal Kombat TV show back in the 90's

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Yeah

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
That was an intru- I remember that show

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
It was on the network here

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
That is now the CW

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
That used to just show all the

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
You know before there was a CW

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Network they would show all the shows

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Yeah no even before that

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Because this show was on I want to say in the early

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
No I guess it was UPN

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
It was UPN at the time that's right

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
So it's just funny

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Anyhow

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
We'll see what becomes of this Mortal Kombat

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
As we get closer to the game coming out

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
But for now we move on with more news

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Slice pop

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Okay so

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Capcom is coming out with a system

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
For Marvel vs. Capcom 3

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Where if you do the versus online mode

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And you're playing some stranger

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
And he dunks on you really bad

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And the only reason why he didn't get a perfect

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
On your ass is because you got in some block damage

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And you say screw this

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And quit

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Well you're going to eventually rally up enough

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Rage quit points or whatever

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
That you're going to be thrown into

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Other random battles with other

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Rage quitters

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
To discourage that type of behavior

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
So yeah

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
That is

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Interesting I believe in

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom for the Wii

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
They have a similar system

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
You enter a random battle

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
In the middle of it because you're losing

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Then once you finally get someone

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
That you can win a round on

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Rage quit on you

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And you guys can just all rage quit on each other

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
While the more serious competitors will

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Take their random battles more seriously I guess

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
So yeah

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
That story

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Came out last week

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Sounds interesting

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I wish they'd do this in WoW

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I wish they'd do this in Grand Theft Auto

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Does everyone seem to like this idea?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
What if the rage quitting is beyond your control though?

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
What if it's like a legit connection failure?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
If you're out in the boonies

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And you only have like maybe satellite

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
As your only broadband option

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Then yeah that might suck for you

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But then again

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
You're still a problem for the people you're trying

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
To play against

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
You're still dropping out all the time

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
So maybe you do need to be paired with the rage quitters

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
They don't know that you dropped out

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
They just think you're a rage quitter anyway

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
So it's still your problem

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
With auto matches and stuff

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
But I would think that they would know

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
That I'm not rage quitting because I'm kicking the fucking

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Ass out of them

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And I'm in first place and then I drop

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It's not like, oh dammit I'm doing too good

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I'm leaving

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Okay well we both see myself

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Maybe a little bit

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Just a tad

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Let's travel around the world and look at release dates

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
For games that are coming out soon

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
More games that you can rage quit in

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Yes this week is not too busy

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
But it doesn't fucking matter

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Because there's only really one game you should pick up

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And that would be LittleBigPlanet 2

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Very excited that this game is coming out

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And I can dust off my PS3 finally

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And play this game

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
So it's pretty awesome

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
If you haven't played this game yet too

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
On Playstation 3 as well

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Mass Effect 2 will be making its way out

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And it's slightly

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Polished

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Mass Effect 3 engine

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Along with all the download content

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So that's kind of cool

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
That'll be out this week as well

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Some other fun stuff coming out this week

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Plants vs. Zombies on Nintendo DS

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Which is a pretty awesome game

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Mindjack is actually

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Kind of a neat looking game

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
This is on Playstation 3 and 360 from Square Enix

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Getting some comparisons

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
To Demon's Souls actually

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Except for the, I don't think it's supposed to be

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
To the point where you want to

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Blow your brains out hard

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
But

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Apparently it's one of those games that

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Has a persistent online

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Portion of it where you can jump into other

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
People's games and play as the villains

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Nice, I love that idea

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
So yeah

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
That's something that's coming out this week which is pretty cool

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
And then

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
What else

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Oh Spellforce 2

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Faith and Destiny I guess is a PC title that's coming out

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
This week as well as Fanatica on PC

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
That was a little bit of a holdover

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
But that's it, really a small week

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I bet you anything there's going to be a Demon's Souls 2

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Announced at E3 this year

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Oh there will be a Demon's Souls 2

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
That game sold incredibly well for them

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I remember though, I actually played that at E3

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Before it came out and there wasn't a whole lot of buzz around it

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
But I remember playing that demo early on

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Thinking it was a pretty neat little game

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
But I didn't know about all these other features

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Until after the game had come out

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
It was hard to get that from a demo

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Playing it on the show floor

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I bet you there's another one coming out this year

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
It's going to be interesting

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I'd say I'd check it out

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
But unfortunately games cost $60

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So if I'm not able to rent it first or try it

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I don't know

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Give it some time

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Especially since it's packed in between

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
LittleBigPlanet 2 and

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Dead Space 2

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
A lot of people aren't going to realize that this game is out

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And they'll probably drop the price rather quick

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
We'll see

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Let's move to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
We have Kinect Joyride coming out on the 360

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
As well as Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Both come out on the 20th of this month

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
On 360

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
So they're getting some of their Kinect localized titles

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
A little later than we had them here

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
That also comes out by the way on the Playstation 3

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Not Kinect of course, but Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Comes out from Namco Bandai

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
This game

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I'm trying to think if I've heard of this here in the US

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And I know I've seen a trailer for this

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And it actually looks pretty awesome

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Loki, what is this game called here?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It's from Namco

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And it's like Overworld

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
There's a giant following you

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
It's called Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Is this called the same game here?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
It came out over the end of November

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
What? I missed this game?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Yes you did

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
This looks kind of neat

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
How well received was it?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I don't know

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It dropped in price a bunch of times

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Right before it came out

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I think it was only a $40 game

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I might have to check that out

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
So many games came out at the end of last year

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I forgot about it because

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Was it

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Operation Black

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Black Ops

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Something like that

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Assassin something or other

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Creed, Brotherhood

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Alright also coming out on Playstation 3

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
This is a price reduction of a game that's already been out

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It comes in the best series now

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Ryugago Toku

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
4 Densetsu

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Sugimono

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
You might know this game as Yakuza 4

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Same game there and that's getting a big price reduction

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
On the Playstation 3 this week

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Going to some other systems like the

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Nintendo Wii

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Sengoku Mosuo 3

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Gets a price reduction this week

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Momotaro Densetsu

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
2010 Sengoku Ishin no Hiro

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Das Yugo

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Gets a price

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I think that's a price reduction as well this week

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So lots and lots of things getting cheaper

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I'm trying to see what this game is

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
This looks kind of like a train station

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
These train games are very popular

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Over there in Japan so it's another train simulator

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Game that is

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Getting a price reduction there

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Starting to see some stuff for the

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
3DS forming in Japan

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Can't talk about it until February 26

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
But that's starting to show up on my list so that's kind of exciting

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
But if you want to go back to the regular DS

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Zombie Daisuke comes out this week

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
As well as yet another price

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Reduction for Gaikuten

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Kenji comes out

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Also Plants vs. Zombies

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I guess comes out in the US this week

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
And that is actually getting some

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Import over in Japan believe it or not

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Also a huge huge release

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
On the PSP this week

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Final Mix

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
So it's kind of like the game redone with the extra stuff

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Including anything we got here

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
In the US that they didn't get over there

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
One other game on the PSP dimension

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Venus and Braves

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Majo to Megami to Horiobi

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
no Yugen comes out from Bandai Namco

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
This week as well

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
So there you go

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Venus Braves by the way is

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
What that series is known as

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
That's it for Japanese releases

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
How about the UK?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Alright for UK releases I'm going to take it back

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
A couple days just to remind everybody

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
In the great old Britain

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
That DC Universe Online

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Came out on the 14th

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
On both PC and

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Playstation 3

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
And also a game called Ghost Trick

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
For the DS that was January 14th

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And Kingdom Hearts

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Recoded as well on the DS on the

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
January 14th

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
For this upcoming week we have on the

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
January 17th

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Monday Night Combat for the PC

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
On the 21st

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
We have LittleBigPlanet 2

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
For the PS3

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Mass Effect 2 for the PS3

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
And Mind Jack for the

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Xbox 360 and

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Playstation 3

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
All of next week

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
On the 21st

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
You know what's funny about those releases

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Is that I almost pretty much heard the same stuff

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
When Loki was talking

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And you don't see that a lot

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Usually the UK will get their stuff late

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Yeah so that's pretty cool

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
That a lot of this stuff is coming out in tandem

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
So if I were living overseas I'd be pretty happy

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Right now to hear that

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Alright well let's move on with a couple more stories

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
And then the classic game of the week

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I know Dark Soccer is not here tonight

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
We're gonna get to the classic game of the week in just a little bit

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
But first two more news stories for you guys

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Yes unfortunately the Wii

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Always gets shit on when it comes

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
To download content

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
And that seems to be what's going on this time

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
The Rock Band Network

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Which is releasing a bunch of indie tracks

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
On the Xbox 360

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
And I believe they were getting a few

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
You know ported over to

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
The PS3 and Wii well that's gonna

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Stop at least on the Wii

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
It says with a smaller install

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Base, limited demand for releases

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
So far and the significant amount of work

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
It takes for our producers and audio team

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
To convert and process

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
These additional tracks

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
We are no longer able to

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Continue submitting Rock Band Network content

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
To the Wii

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
So to summarize

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Or in other words no one's fucking buying

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
It so we're gonna stop making it

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
It says regular Wii DLC

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And Rock Band Network releases for the 360

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
And PS3 will continue uninterrupted

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Honestly

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Truthfully I think the Wii owners are lucky

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
To be getting any DLC at all

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Like with how crappy Nintendo's

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Online front end is compared to their competitors

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I am I honestly think

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Harmonix is graceful

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
And generous in the amount of content

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
That they do put out on the Wii

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And like I realize that a lot of people own a Wii

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And a lot of people have this game on the Wii

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
But I think they more than support

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Their game like better than

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Probably any other fucking company

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Does on the Wii

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Well at least on the Wii though you get some Rock Band stuff

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
This week on the 18th

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
You get the main drag

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
How we look on paper

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Wounded Soul RX

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Band of Horses

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
The Great Soul Lake

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Firewind Head of High

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Seton Clausen

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
The Soul Side

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
White Heat

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
OK Go with White Knuckles

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Alright

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Moving on

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
This makes me very happy because I

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Loved all these old school PC

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Games back in the day

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Apparently there's a new web app

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
That allows you to play Sierra

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Online games on your iPad

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
In related news

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I'm gonna go buy an iPad

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Like ASAP

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I wonder if it will work on the iPhone

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
But I don't know it might be a little hard to play on the iPhone

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Alright here's the deal

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
The website

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Is called Sarian.net

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
It's made

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
The Sierra Online adventure games

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
That they have like Space Quest, Kings Quest

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
And Leisure Suit Larry

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
You can play them on the iPad

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
All you have to do is go to the website

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
S-A-R-I-E-N.net

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And do this before they get that season desist letter loaded on them

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
You can go on there and you can play

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
These games on the iPad

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And it looks like the way this works

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Is a lot of the words kind of show up

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
On the bottom of the screen so you can kind of touch them

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
To put the words in and what have you

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Uh yeah

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
That's basically the deal

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Man that's great if I had an iPad

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I'd be checking that out right now

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
In fact I might try it on my iPhone

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
But I'm guessing it doesn't work nearly as well

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Because you don't have quite the same real estate

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
So there you go

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I wonder how they're getting away with this

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I guess it's just kind of one of those

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Intel they get the season desist letter

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
They're just gonna do it

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
On the internet everybody has it

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I don't know

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
S-S-A-R-I-E-N.net.net says wait for iPad 2

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
It comes with electric boogaloo

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
That's from our chatroom chat.orangelsageradio.com

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I am gonna actually wait for uh

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
iPad 2

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I do want to wait for that

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Because it'll have the front facing cam

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
And all the other frills and stuff

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Yeah I enjoy whenever we go to the mall

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And we pass the Apple store

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I was like hey Rob go get your iPad

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Just impulse buy it right now

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
These days I'm gonna do it

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
And then you're gonna be like I was kidding

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I ain't really mean for that to happen

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Well you know when the iPad 2 is announced

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
The prices of those iPad 1's are gonna

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Plummet. Like they're gonna go down to

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Two, three hundred dollars

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I have so many friends that work at the Apple

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Mothership down in

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Where is that?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I don't even know

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Well all your friends work there shouldn't you know?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Cupertino here

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
And whenever the new generation of

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
iPods come out

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Within their internal employee store

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Cause they get mark downs on that

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Dirt cheap I've gotten two iPods that way

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Nice

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Well except you'll want a new one

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
No I want one of the new fancy pants ones

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I don't want that old shit I want the new one

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
So I can do drunken FaceTime cause that's the only reason you use FaceTime

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Is when you're rip-roaring drunk which I didn't do last night

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Oddly enough but anyway

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
FaceTime is best for like drunk

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Dialing it's drunk dialing for a new century

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Is what it is

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
There you go

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
And to answer your question

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Yes you can play it on an

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
iPod but

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
It's hard

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Why is it hard?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
It's small because you have to type in text on the bottom here

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Oh yuck

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
But you can do it you can click around

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Cause it supports the

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Safari

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Wow that's kinda cool

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Alright question from our chat

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Live here on this Sunday evening

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Dark Tetsuya says Rob you gonna wait for the 3DSI?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
No I'm getting the 3DS right

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
When it comes out and I bet a lot of you

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Skeptic folks the first time you see the 3DS

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
You're gonna be like holy shit it really is 3D

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Without glasses and you'll probably buy it too

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I'm really not trying to sound

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Like a fanboy like don't get me wrong

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Nintendo pisses me off more than they usually make me happy

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
But the 3DS

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
It's a pretty fantastic piece of technology

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Like I'm almost excited to get it for

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
And I know this is gonna sound weird cause I'm

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Not a fan of 3D movies but like

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
The 3D on the DS doesn't really bother me

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I'm excited to see what kind of 3D movies

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Come out on the DS

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
If Tron Legacy comes out in 3D

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
On the DS on the 3DS

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Like I'm there

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Hello

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Seriously don't you want that?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
So

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Hell yes I want that

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Alright let's get to the classic

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Game of the week here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
We do a segment every week called the classic

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Game of the week and it has a little theme

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Song

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
And this is the part of the week where DarkSakura

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Dives into her vault and she drags out

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
A classic video game and she says hey

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
You ungrateful brats this is a game

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
That you should be playing this week but guess what?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
She ain't here so we've hijacked

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
The classic game of the week segment this week

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
And we're allowing her fill in tonight

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
SalaciousPop to choose a

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Classic game of the week that he thinks

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
You guys should be playing because you know

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
DarkSakura love her to bits

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
And she does pick a lot of Sega stuff

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
So we thought maybe SalaciousPop could pick something

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
That DarkSakura maybe would not pick

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I made sure that I'm not

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Stepping on DarkSakura's toes on the whole

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Console classic

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
So I picked a PC classic

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Namely King's Quest 4

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
The Perils of Rosella

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
How appropriate considering the last story

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Off of the Sierra Online story we just finished up

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Wonderful choice

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Let's see if we can get some music here

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
A single tear rolling down my face right now

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
At the title screen music

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
This is the fourth

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
In the series obviously

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Came out August 16th

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
1988 for MS-DOS

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Amiga

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Apple 2GS

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
And Atari ST

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
PC platforms

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I remember playing this game

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
With my friend in junior high

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Across I think 9

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
5 and a quarter inch floppies

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
And you could install it to your hard drive

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And hard drives back then were like 40 megabytes

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
If you were lucky

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Or you could move

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
To the next screen and it'll say

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Insert disk 6

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Insert disk 7

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
So it was a game like that

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
I loved this game

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Because it was the last

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
In the King's Quest series

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
That used the traditional text based

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Input system

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Like look under bridge

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Search room all that stuff

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
King's Quest 5

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Adopted the new mouse cursor

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Engine

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
So King's Quest 4 the last

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Traditional text based King's Quest game

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Takes place immediately

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
After the events of

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
King's Quest 3

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
You play Rosella

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
The daughter of King Graham

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Of Daventry

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
King Graham in the opening sequence has a heart attack

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
The magic mirror tells you

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
You need to be ported away to

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
A magical world

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
To Tamir

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
To find this fruit

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
And if King Graham can eat the fruit he will not die

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
And this game had an internal timer

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
You had to get the fruit and make it back

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
To King Graham within a certain amount of game time

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Or else he would die and it would be game over

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
So you had to figure out the puzzles relatively quickly

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
At some point

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
It turned to night

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And everything got dark

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
There were certain puzzles that you could only

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Like there was an abandoned mansion

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
There was nothing to do there

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Unless you went there at night when it was haunted

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Because the puzzles didn't light up

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Until it was dark

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
So you had to

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Do everything else and then

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
That was the last place you went to

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
While it was still nightfall

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
It had multiple endings

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
It was possible to

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Survive the

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Dangers of Tamir and escape the

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Evil witch Lalote

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
And make it back

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
To King Graham without actually getting

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
The fruit

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
So you had to be

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Able to figure out where it was

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
What items you needed to

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Get the item and then

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
You know, survive the evil

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
The antagonist, the evil witch

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And then give him the food in the end

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
So it had multiple endings which was pretty

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Innovative at the time

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I think EGA graphics

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
But the pixels were a lot smaller

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Than the traditional King's Quest games

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
So visually even for EGA graphics

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
16 color

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Stunning, and the music of course

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
With the King's Quest 4 I believe

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Was one of the first Sierra games that actually

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Used sound cards

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Instead of just the beep beep beep beep

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Good old ad lib

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I had an ad lib back in the day

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
King's Quests, I want to say 1 through 3

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Or maybe 1 and 2

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Just use your internal speaker

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
The loud harsh beeps

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Sound card support

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
So amazing game

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Also like most

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Of the King's Quest games it was possible

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
To miss an item that you needed

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
To not die or to

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Kill the big bad at the end

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
If you missed that puzzle

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
If you let Cupid fly away from the little pool

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Without getting his cupid's bow and arrow

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And you saved your game, you were screwed

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Couldn't beat it, sorry try again

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
So yeah

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Great game

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
So many people think so fondly

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Of 4 specifically, like you asked

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Most people what's your favorite King's Quest game

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
And most people, including myself, would say

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
4 was the best, period

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Out of a what, 8 game series

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Most people would say 4 is the best

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I rejected the reality

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And where it ate is real

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
7

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Fine, some might argue 9

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
If you count this fan silver lining at this point

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
But why is it, regardless of how many

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
You think there are

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Why is it that 4 is the one that's so fond

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
And meet people's hearts

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I mean, again, I'm sure there's people listening to this show going

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
No, 5 was my favorite, or you know, 1 was the best

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Why 4? So many people that I know at least

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Um

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Visually, at the time, people just

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Never saw a game that was that beautiful

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
On PC gaming

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
It really took EGA graphics

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
As far as they literally could go

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Without stepping up to VGA 256 colors

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Um, so just visually

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
People just remember how awestruck they were

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
When they saw it

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
And they loaded up the game

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
When you first arrive on that beach

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And you can see the wave of the ocean

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Up against, you know, the yellow sand

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
The sound card support

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
To actually have ad-lib music coming at you through your speakers

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Um

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And I think the nostalgia of

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Text-based RPGs

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Cause it was the last one in that series

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
King's Quest V and VI were all mouse-based

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I think for me, a big part of it too was in the story

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
It seemed like a lot of it was inspired by

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Fables, Aesop's Fables, like Hansel's and Gretel's

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Type of thing, I think that is very

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Fond as well for me, I think that's why

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I grabbed it for IV

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
King's Quest has always had that a little bit, but yes

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
There were a lot of great

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Meta genre references

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Particularly in IV

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Um, the three hags that represent

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
The three fates that all share one eye

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
And you had to catch their eyes

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
So they were blind, otherwise they were gonna eat you

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
That was in King's Quest IV

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Um, you find a

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Gold ball and you throw it into a pond

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And you have to kiss the frog, like the

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Princess and the frog, that's in King's Quest IV

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
So a lot of, yeah, classic fairy tale

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Um, homages are in

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
In this particular title

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Man, I really wish this series would come back

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
And yes, I understand there's the fan project

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
And I mean no disrespect, they're doing a

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Wonderful, wonderful thing, and they've

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Taken so much shit for what is really

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Like, a thing that they love, and you know

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
So I'm definitely not slamming that at all

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
But I really wish somebody would just

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Give people lots of money

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
To make a big budget return

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Of King's Quest, you know what I mean?

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
How awesome would that be?

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Well, there have been fan service, um

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
VGA or SVGA remakes of the first three

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Sure, sure

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
That are completely independent and they run great

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
But I mean, just like now with today's technology

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
And games and so forth with, you know, like

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
The DVD and Blu-ray technology and stuff

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Like, I would just love to see, like, a really

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Well done new King's Quest game

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
That's just, you know, like

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
I don't know, I don't even know how to explain it

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Like, just that whole kind of world

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
I want to go back to that, you know

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Yeah, yeah

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I don't know, and again, I realize Silver Lining

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Can kind of take me there, but Silver Lining

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Is also very much in that same vein

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Of what we remember, but I'd like to see

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Someone kind of like take King's Quest, that series

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
And bring it to today's technology

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Big budget type of game

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
The closest thing I think we got was the longest

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Journey and the longest journey 2

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Completely different franchise and story

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And company, but when that game, cause

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
There was a point in the

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
There was, I think, a sort of a

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
A shift in what people wanted

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
On PC gaming, I think around

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Maybe the early, mid 90's

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Where adventure games were boring

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
People didn't like them anymore

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Cause Doom came in

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And PC became about first person shooters

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And then Half-Life and all that

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
And the Sierra style of games, Space Quest

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
King's Quest, were sort of left in the wake

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
You would think though, with all the nostalgia

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Wank that happens out there in the world

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Though that there would be room for this

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And I realize that's kind of where Telltale

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Kind of has their market right now

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And they do a very good job at what they do

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
But I'm just surprised

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Especially when that whole silver lining stuff

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Was going on, that uh, who owns a license now?

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Activision I guess, who got it from Vivendi

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Has basically said, you know what

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
We don't want to revisit that world

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And that's not just King's Quest

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
That's Space Quest, that's uh

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Police Quest, Quest for Glory

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Quest for Glory, all that stuff

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And it's just, I don't know, it's just kind of annoying

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Cause I would really like to see some of that come back

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
This is gonna sound a little elitist

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
And maybe I'm a bit proud

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
That this is elitist

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
These games, probably too hard

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
For kids these days

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
They were hard, you could save your game and just

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Screw up, you had to start all the way over

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
That stuff doesn't fly now

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And for it to be a true King's Quest

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Or Space Quest game, it would need to be hard

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
As hell, you would need to be able to

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
You know?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
You didn't fail, sorry

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
You didn't throw the boot at the cat

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
So now the mouse isn't gonna rescue you

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
In King's Quest V, so lol, 15 hours of your life

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
You have to do over

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
That won't fly anymore

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
That's true

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Everybody wants the easy button now

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Alright, well if you want to go

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
See how we had it when we were young

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
You ungrateful kids, go check out

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
King's Quest IV, The Perils of Rosella

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Because it was just one of the best

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
King's Quest games they ever did

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I believe this was ported to a variety of consoles

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
It's not just PC

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I mean, clearly the PC is the best one

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
But if you must, I believe it was on the NES

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Wasn't it?

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
V was, V was ported

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I thought IV was on the NES too

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Yeah, V was the one

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Also, you can get the King's Quest collection

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
And Space Quest collection on Steam

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
It comes with DOSBox

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Which is that sort of indie MS-DOS

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Emulator that's fully inclusive of all that

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Stuff that will run on Windows 7

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
That includes, of course

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
This game, King's Quest IV

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
For about 20 bucks on Steam

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
For whatever reason, it's never

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
On sale, so I think the licensing

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
For it is very bare bones

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Where Activision is like, here's this

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
DOSBox emulated

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Comp of these old ass games

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
And we're not letting you put it on sale

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Ever

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Steam never really

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Features it on the RPG page

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
You have to literally search for it in the Steam client

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
King's Quest collection

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
But you can get it, yeah

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
If anybody's still using GameTap, I think a lot of those games

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Are on there too

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Good old games, GOG might have some of these too

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Yeah, absolutely

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says, Westwood also put out

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
The Chirandia series of adventure games

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Just reminded me of another great series

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
That was one Loki really liked too, if I remember right

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Yes, I did

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Specifically Chirandia, The Hands of Fate

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Alright, well that's gonna do it for our

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Classic game of the week

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Very good pick, Alan, very well done

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I'm sure DarkSakura would be proud

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
We'll ask her when she gets back

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
But we are gonna take a quick break, but don't worry

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
There's plenty more OLR to come

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
We're gonna get to some rapid fire news

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Twitter topics of course, if you haven't submitted

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Your tweets tonight, you should get those in at

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Twitter.com slash OLR

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
We've got a lot of stuff about the 3DS

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
We haven't even got to yet

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And some other stuff on the PSP too

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
But not just that, because we'll talk about that

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Dreamcast collection, and if

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Everything goes bad in Part B, don't worry

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Mama will fix it. This is right, another

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Cookie Mama story coming up in Part B

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
So we'll be right back you guys with a little more of

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Orange Lounge Radio, don't go anywhere

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000

of 2011

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Dark Sakura, she is out right now

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
She's on her way back, she's been at some

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Type of pinball event all day, I'm hoping

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
She makes it back before the end of the show

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
So we can ask her about that a little bit, but joining

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000

Thank you. You're welcome. And of course

Tackle some of the news, and we're gonna let Loki tackle

Some of the quick news here in just a minute

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
But first, I wanna make sure that I do

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Give some plugs

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Towards the spinoff shows

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
If you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, we're

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Starting this whole little mini

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Family of shows I guess you could

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Say, do listen to Comic

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000

She does that at

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
The infamous.net

Is where you can find that or you can search for it on

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
iTunes, Comic Insanity

It's the letter N, there's no I

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
In front of that. Also if you like World

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Of Warcraft, you might wanna check out my show

Horde House, that tapes every Thursday

There might be a live episode

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
This week, we are working on that

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I'm gonna try and hammer out the

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Details, I don't know exactly

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
How that's gonna work cause I gotta make sure if

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
It's gonna be at all games we have to respect

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
There are other shows that already have time slots

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
So we're gonna try to make that happen

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
This week

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
One off thing, we're not always live though, and if you like

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
That, Xtafer is my co-host

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
There and he's pretty hilarious and

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
We talk a lot about World of Warcraft and all that good stuff

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
So check that out, we don't really have

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
A website for that yet, but you can find us on

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
iTunes at Horde House, or if you go to

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
OrangeLaundry.com, the main site for

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Our show, there are little buttons that link you to

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Our side projects right there, it's great

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
So check it out

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Alright, let's move on to some quick news

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
And we'll get to Twitter topics

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
In just a minute, so last call for some Twitter topics

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
At Twitter.com slash

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
O-L-R while we do some rapid fire news

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
As part of that

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Whole Mega Man

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Legends 3 meta thing that they have going on

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Where basically the fans

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Decide

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
You know

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Different aspects of Mega Man

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Well it came down to voice actresses

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Or actors

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
For the Mega Man role

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And it was up to the vote

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Of fans and 3000 people voted

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
And it looks like

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
That your Mega Man voice

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Actress is going to be

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Akimi Kondra

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
And I guess

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
She was the voice actress

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
That did work in

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Mega Man X command mission

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
And powered up, and I guess she's also

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Done work in Persona 4, Fatal Frame 2

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
And Clonad

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
That's pretty cool

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
And I guess Mega Man Legends 3

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Is headed to the 3DS

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Another reason to own a 3DS

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Fucking Mega Man

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Legends

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
The Dreamcast collection

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Something that's been rumored for a while

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Is actually coming out on PC

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
And Xbox 360

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
This February

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
I gotta admit though it's not too exciting

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
It's really just a collection of

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
The titles that are coming out on Xbox Live

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Arcade

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Crazy Taxi, Sonic Adventure

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Sega Bass Fishing, and Space Channel 5

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Part 2

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
To enhance up res graphics

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Apparently it's going to retail for $30

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
And it'll be out on

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
February 22nd

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Is that something that you'd be interested in

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Rob, since you know it does have Space Channel 5

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Of course, I hella want

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Space Channel 5

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I wouldn't buy the collection, I'd just buy

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Space Channel 5 when it comes out on

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Xbox Live Arcade

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
That's what made my ears perk up

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Because

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Sonic Adventure, I heard that port wasn't

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Very good, Crazy Taxi's missing a lot of the

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
License stuff, Sonic Adventure just wasn't very good

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
So, you can port it all you want

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
It's Sega Bass Fishing, I just

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Don't give a shit about that, so you know

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Um

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
And this is a

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Juicy rumor here, apparently

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
You know, the uh

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Well actually

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I'm jumping ahead here, you are a little bit

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Sorry, must have missed the link

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
There, no, this is actually a juicy

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Rumor, it's actually coming in the form of

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Slurpees

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
They're going to be doing some sort of promotion

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Now with LittleBigPlanet 2 and Killzone 3

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Where you can go buy Slurpees

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
And at your local

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
7-Eleven

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
And you'll be able to get different

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I guess

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Prizes

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Or codes that you can

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Redeem for things, they're going to have

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Strategy guides, premium themes

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Download content, and more

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
No word if they're

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Going to actually have any sort of special

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Flavors to go along with them

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
I almost wanted to stop at

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
7-Eleven on the way here, because it's like

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Ooh, Slurpee

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
That's good stuff

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Alright, Slurpees are amazing

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
But lots of calories

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
So for those of you that are trying to do

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Diets for the new year, I'd stay

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Away from Slurpees, just saying

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
But they're really good

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I love the Pina Colada ones

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Yeah, I was just about to bring that up

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
So gross

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
He'll get the large Slurpee of the flavor

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I think Coconut is vile

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
So he will get the Pina Colada to guarantee

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
That I won't try to, you know, Bogart it from him

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I love Coconut, like I love McCroons

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Are like my favorite cookie ever

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And then Coconut Cream Pie is so amazing

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Oh my gosh

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Coconut's very high in fat though, just saying

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
If I cook something awesome, then I just have to put

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
That'll guarantee that it's mine

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
And Rob won't try to eat it

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I hate mayonnaise

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Even today, we were at Panera Bread, Loki's favorite restaurant

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
We decided to go to Panera Bread for the show

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
It's not my favorite restaurant

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Right here at OLR it is

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
What have I been eating the last two weeks?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
French onion soup

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
No, I have not been eating French onion soup

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I have been having

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Was it a ten piece

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
The Honey Hot BBQ Wings

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
From KFC

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
With a giant root beer

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Without ice, because I do not want my

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Root beer watered down by crappy ice

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
How dare they

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
How dare they steal some of my

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Precious root beer room with ice

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
I don't know what it is

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
But A&W from an A&W

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Or even the combination KFC A&W

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Like they have out here is so much better

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Than the ones at the store, I can't explain it

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
A&W from the tap is so much better

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
They sell them in gallon jugs

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I swear to god

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
I can drink a half gallon

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I can do it

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I've seen them

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
They are seriously

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It's a sight to behold

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I tell you man

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I took Salacious Pop to Panera for the first time today

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
He really liked it

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
I guess they don't have them in his neck of the woods

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Kind of a new thing

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
People on Facebook have said there is a bunch around me

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
But in the neighborhood I'm in there aren't any

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I've never seen one

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
What's ironic is

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
It took the place of a Krispy Kreme

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
It's kind of one extreme to the other

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I know and that is crime right there

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Really they should have just

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
They should have tore down another restaurant

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Get rid of the Wendy's

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Wendy's sucks and everything

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Alright let's get back to gaming news

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Yet again the food topic

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I don't even know what to say

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
We have a release date for PlayStation Move Heroes

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
It's March 22nd

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Some bonuses that come with the reservations

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Depending on where you reserve it

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Amazon and Gamestop

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
You can get a skin pack with Pirate Sly

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Freedom League Jack and

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Trillium Armor Ratchet

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Is all the special stuff you can get there

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Apparently quote

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
There's also a full story surrounding the game

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
And why they're all together

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
That is from Christian Cardona

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
The marketing manager of the game

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
PlayStation Move Heroes

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I have yet to buy a PlayStation Move

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Super Street Fighter 4 3D

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Is coming out of course on the 3DS

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Online multiplayer

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
That's pretty neat

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
There was a whole little trailer too that hit the internet this week

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
That was showing some of the features like that

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
But there's also going to be worldwide online play

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And what's called channel live

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
You can just watch live matches

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And channel live if you want to watch the pros do their thing

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
There's also figurine collecting

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
And random street fighting modes

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
If you want to do that

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
That's that whole using the aware thing

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
As you walk by people

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
I guess your character can fight somebody else

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
That's going to be a pretty big launch title

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Even though most of us have already played Super Street Fighter 4

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
My question is

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And maybe this has already been answered somewhere

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
I just haven't seen it

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
How has the character roster been affected by the move to the 3DS

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I mean surely they had to cut some characters out right

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Or did they not

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Wow that's pretty amazing

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
The videos and the YouTubes that have been out of this game

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Have blown my mind on how good it looks

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
So if for it to look that good

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
If they cut a few characters

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
In order for that to happen I do not mind

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
There's some awesome stuff coming out on that game right now

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Yeah I'm trying to see if there's a 3DS thing

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Let's see

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
It's coming out, it has Wi-Fi

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000
It has all 35 console characters plus

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Yeah all of them are going to be on the 3DS release

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000
It's been called exactly the same as its HD counterparts by Capcom

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
That's pretty amazing

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
You can set up four hotkeys

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
For moves and combos on the touch screen

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
That's kind of interesting

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Can I go on the tangent train a little bit?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Of course

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I really hope that this generation of handhelds

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Be it the 3DS or the PSP2

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Uses more of the infrastructure central server style of multiplayer

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Because the last few generations

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Obviously you've got the Game Boy Advance with the link up cable

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
That was the last generation that used that

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
With the PSP and the DS

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
It's all ad hoc

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I don't know that many people that have a PSP

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Where I can be in the same room with them

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
And do ad hoc connect

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
So I really want this generation

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Super Street Fighter 4 3DS

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
To have the central server

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
And I know with the PS3 and the PSP

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
You can do the tethering

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
But that's still just too cumbersome for me

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
It's too much of a pain in the ass I agree

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
So I love handhelds

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
But I'll never play ad hoc support

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Because I don't know that many friends with them

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
So that's all

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Let's talk about another fighting game on the 3DS

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Dead or Alive Dimensions

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
It's kind of interesting because they've talked about

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
This game is going to have 30 frames a second and 60 frames a second

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.000
It just depends on if you're playing 3D or 2D

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
So if you're playing in 3D mode

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
You only get 30 frames a second per eye

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
But if you decide to condense it down to 2D

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
You'll get a 60 frames a second fighter

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
That's kind of interesting

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I mean it makes sense too

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Because obviously 3D is rendering one frame

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
And then another really fast back and forth

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
In rapid succession

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
They look pretty good in 3D

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
But that's pretty cool that if you get sick of 3D

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
There's kind of like a little perk if you will

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
To play in 2D

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Kind of neat

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I'm sure a lot of games are like that by the way

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Yeah same with Street Fighter IV on there

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Because they have that really funky view that you can do

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
That gives it more depth

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
But if you don't want to do that

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
You don't have to do that

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Salacious Pop has a few stories for us

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Then we're going to get to the Twitter topics

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Real quick though

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
It seems to be kind of smart in Nintendo's part

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
At least, well I don't know if it's Nintendo's part

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
But as far as like

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
The games that are coming out launched

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
You know for it and stuff

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
It seems to be kind of quite a variety

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
It's not all like, oh it's Mario this

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Or you know Zelda this

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
And all kitty stuff

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
It's like we've got some hardcore fighters in there

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
We've got a little bit of

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
You know the Nintendogs kind of crap

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
And a little bit of

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Something for everybody

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I think that's pretty awesome

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Indeed, it sounds like it's going to have

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
A pretty good lineup at the beginning

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I hope the price is reasonable

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
We'll see pretty soon though

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Alright Salacious Pop

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Okay

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
For my quick fire stories

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Those of you who wanted to play

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Pac-Man Battle Royale

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
The Return to Form

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Pac-Man arcade game multiplayer

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
That is now available to

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
American arcade distributors

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
So that means that whatever arcade

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
If you're fortunate enough to live in an area

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
That still has one

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
They can have it

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
It's a cocktail style cabinet

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
You know the old pizza parlor

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Model to set your drink on it

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
So it's the flat glass

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Coming soon to Dave and Busters everywhere I'm sure

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Yeah

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
According to the source of the article

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Arcade Heroes

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
It's currently being sold

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
For $4,275

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
To the arcade businesses

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
That might want to get it and put it in the store

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Or in their arcade

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Which apparently is cheaper

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Than most of the other stuff

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Most arcade games right now that are popular

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Are the ticket spitters

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
And the big time crisis

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
The huge shoot-em-up

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Arcade games

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
So the Pac-Man

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Battle Royale cocktail cabinet

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
A little over $4,000 I guess

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
For a new arcade machine

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
So yeah

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Pac-Man fans look for that in your arcade

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Starting hopefully as soon as this month

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Because it's out there for us to buy it

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
So

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Next

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
The domain name

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000
FinalFantasy13-2game.com

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Has been registered by Squeenix

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
So everyone's all

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Freaking out about what this means

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Maybe Lightning is going to become a pop singer

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Just like What's-Her-Name

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Final Fantasy X

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
So yeah

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
That was registered

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Along with a bunch of other domains

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
For their

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
N-I-E-R

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Nier

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Nier and Mindjack

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
So a bunch of domains were registered

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
For those properties

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Square is holding a

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
First production

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Party premiere event in Japan

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
For two days on the 18th

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
So people are like what titles

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
And little side story

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Projects are they going to announce

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Maybe we'll finally get to see something from

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Final Fantasy 13 Versus

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Which very well could be just being released here

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
As Final Fantasy 13-2

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Versus 13 for the PS3

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
And then the Fabula

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
The PSP

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Part of the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Those two titles are still

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I don't want to call them vaporware

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
We know that they exist

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
So there's that

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Maybe we'll find out about

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Kingdom Hearts 3

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Maybe

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Maybe we'll find out

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
That would be a great E3 announcement though

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Final Fantasy 7

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Remake maybe

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I'm just flame baiting at this point

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Maybe we'll find out about Final Fantasy 14

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Do-Over

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
The Do-Over expansion

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
If they said they were doing Final Fantasy 6

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
The 3DS

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Then I would

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
That would be enough for me

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
So Square is having some event in two days

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
And they registered 13-2 game

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Final Fantasy 13-2.com

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
So speculate to your heart's content

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Last quick fire story for me

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Is that some of the retail

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Marketing assets

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
For Marvel versus Capcom 3

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Have Akuma

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
On them as a playable character

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
It's just a print

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Assets for the game

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
And I guess apparently Akuma

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Hasn't been really made official

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
On that roster

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Well I would kind of think duh Akuma is in it

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
But I guess this is the first time we've seen

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Akuma in print material

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
For MVC 3

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Geez do we have the full roster yet?

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Because it seems like every week there's some damn story about

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Oh this character is in it

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Well in this little

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Sample graphic here it's got Akuma

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
On Bonn which we already knew about

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Albert Wesker, I don't know if I knew about him

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Yeah he was announced

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
A while ago. And then Arthur of course

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
From Ghosts and Goblins

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
So yeah

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
So we know that Akuma

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Is at least in print material for the game

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
So maybe he's unlockable

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
But he's in there

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Alright we'll see

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
For now let's go to the Twitter

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
We're going to get some tweets

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Every week we ask you guys to show us your tweets

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
At twitter.com slash o-l-r

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
And we're going to read some messages

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Sent to us right now

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
We'll start off with Spassinator PSN

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Send us a couple tweets here

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
There's been a ton of free stuff put onto the PSN

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Video store lately

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
The usual spot so be sure to check it out

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
So if you like free videos

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
You can check that out

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Hopefully your console doesn't get borked if you try to hack it

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
And then you'll lose that rights to all that video content

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
So be careful

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Retertainment, I like this tweet

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Which console would compete better on Jeopardy?

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
The 360

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
The PS3

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Or the Wii

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Cause you know if you haven't heard there's that whole computer

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
That's going on Jeopardy that's supposed to be doing battle

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Against what like Ken Jennings

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
And I don't know somebody else

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Whatever

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
So I don't know, what do you guys think?

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Which console would compete best on Jeopardy?

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I would guess the Playstation 3

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Because of that whole

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Uber chip that's inside it

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
It's kind of got the best

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Computer parts

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
If you will

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Well the 360 would call Alex Trebek a fag

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
And then the panel would go red

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
The right on screen

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
It would go red and then it would just sit there

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
For the rest of the show

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
And Alex Trebek would be like

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
So yeah

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
And then the Wii

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
The Wii couldn't even connect to the internet

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
To be able to play the game

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
I'm gonna say the PS3

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Act Def sends us a link to a story

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
About a video game pirate trades

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Sales for Steam

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
It's a link to a story on Kotaku

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
About a video game pirate who has reformed

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
And wrote this whole story

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
I'm not gonna read the whole damn story

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
But he you know

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Wrote this whole little piece for Kotaku

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
And talked about how he was a pirate

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And a thief and so forth

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
He said near the end of 2010

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
He had stopped playing PC games all together

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
And if he ended up liking a game

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
He wouldn't even bother to order it

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
He'd just keep playing it until he beat it and then move on

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Then Steam I guess changed his mind

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
He has been a user on Steam for five years

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
And then

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
He would I guess wake up during the holiday sale

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
And see what games he's going to buy

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Having the convenience of Steam

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
To download games right there

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Was enough for him

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
He bought 22 games over the course of the sale

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
There you go

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I guess the 3DS too is something else that's

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Making him reform

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
You can read the whole piece there on Kotaku

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Another link sent to us on Twitter

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
From SJ100Matt says

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
It's a link about a group of fans remaking

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Sonic 2 in HD

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
This is yet another one of those things

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Where I remember one of these

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Not that long ago there was a story about

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
A Sonic game that was being like remade

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Or like a whole new HD Sonic game

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
That looked better than Sonic 4

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
I think Jamie had the story

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
And she was reporting on it

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
And what Sega's putting out

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
And now there's this whole little teaser on YouTube

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I guess for a remade

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Sonic 2 in HD

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Now it just looks like old school Sonic

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
But in widescreen and high def

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
It looks great

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Why the fuck isn't this on Xbox Live?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
I can't

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I love how all the fans

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Try to one-up Sega though

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
It's like at what point does

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Flattery become insult

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Like seriously I don't even know

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Defective Candy sends us a tweet

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
The first kinetic app

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Has shown up in the Mac App Store

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
It's called the Connect 3D Viewer

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
App and you can plug the USB Connect

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Into the app

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
I'm sorry into your Mac and you get a

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
3D visualization of the depth

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Data you can also map

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
RGB values on the image

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
You can zoom and rotate the

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Visualization so it kind of looks like an

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Old school like Max Headroom thing from the 80's

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
In this little clip you see there

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Yeah now that the Mac App Store is open

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
People are putting all sorts of creative things

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Up on there so that's interesting

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
If I had a Mac I'd probably be checking that out

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Unfortunately I only have an iPhone

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
And I can't hook up my connect to my iPhone

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Let's see

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Tigerclaw305 on Twitter sends us a few

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Tweets, one of them has to do

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
This whole thing about the

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Hacking of the Playstation 3

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Apparently there's something going on there that's threatening the

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Trophy system

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
The PS3 Unlocker is this app that's out there

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
You can only use it on a jailbroken

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Console and I guess what happens is that

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
You can actually unlock trophies for

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Buzz, Quiz, TV, Disc

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
You get 100% of the trophies

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
But not every game works like Resident Evil 5

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Gold Edition and Batman Arkham Asylum

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Don't work yet

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
So wow

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
That sucks actually

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
For Sony if that happens

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Because there's just going to be so many people

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
That abuse that and it's too bad

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
They could easily ban those people

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
That do that. They do that for Xbox

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Live right now because you can do that already

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
With JTAG consoles

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
But I mean

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
You can tell

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Usually you can tell

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Hey he has a 2 million

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Gamer score

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
That's a little weird

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Probably a little high

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
I enjoy metagaming and the whole

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Semi-EP'ing achievement point thing

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
WoW has it, Xbox has it

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I think it's neat but I just

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Can't imagine who is taking this seriously

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Enough to where they want to hack themselves

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Up into the 50,000 score

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
So they can go hey look at my gamer card

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Look at my score

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Who is that person because I want to meet them and maybe

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Push them down some stairs

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Yeah I mean it's like you know

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Big fucking deal, like woo

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
You unlocked everything and you did it by cheating

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
It's unfortunate

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Someone who does it legitimately

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Gets some really cool

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Achievement but you know

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
The person who unlocks the most

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Maximum achievements in one game

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Isn't good at every single game

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
And that's okay

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
It's just like in the Olympics the same competitors

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Don't do every single sport

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Unless you're looking at something like the Decathlon

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
But that's different

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
And XBLA will occasionally feature

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
A gamer on Xbox Live that has a really

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
High number, sometimes it'll be

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
An Iraqi vet

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
That's now disabled and they play Xbox

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
With a 50,000 XBLA score

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
And that's interesting to find out about the people

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
That have numbers that high because they just

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Play that much

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
And a hack like this kind of takes away from

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
The few people that you know

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Have made a name for themselves out of metagaming

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
So yeah

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
So stopping a dick basically folks

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
This is just a dick thing to do is to unlock all the trophies

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
That you didn't earn

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Dick, alright

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Moving on to another tweet, the last tweet tonight

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Also from Tigerclaw

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I guess is going on there

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Epic Games has an upcoming first person shooter

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Called Bulletstorm

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I guess the Xbox Live and Playstation Network

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Demo is coming out on January 25th

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
If you want to check this out and see if this is the game for you

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
The demo will have

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Usage of the echo mode

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
It's a score based mode in the game

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Where you can use skill shots

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
And so forth

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
45 of the game skill shots will be in there

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
As well as a range of weapons

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
So it sounds like you'll be able to get a pretty good taste for the game there

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
We'll get into stores

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
On February 22nd

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
And there you go

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
We got one more tweet to us

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
From DarkSakura on Twitter

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Tweets us saying

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Why you so hot?

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
I don't know if she's listening

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
On the mobile thing

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
If you have an iPhone or whatever

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
You can just go to allgames.com

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
And it's like HTML5 now

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
You don't need an app anymore

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
There used to be an app, you don't need it anymore

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
You can listen to all games while you're on the road

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
So she might be doing that

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
So hi Jamie if you're listening

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
They're really close

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
She's at the IKEA, that's only 20 minutes away

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
So she's going to make it

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Probably just in time for phone calls

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
But I think you're doing a fabulous job

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
So you would make DarkSakura very proud

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I want to do this last story before

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Well let's hurry up and get there

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Because we're through Twitter topics

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
So we've got a couple more stories here

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
We'll go to Loki

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Ah yes, so we were talking a little bit about

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
The 3DS and stuff

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Of course not all of the news is great

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
They're going to be first off

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Region locking the console

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Which is not a huge surprise

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Because the DSi, at least the DSiWare part

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Was actually region locked

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
But now they've kind of gone against

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
What they've been doing with the NDS and stuff

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
And they're just locking the console

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
As I said before in our first story

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.000
You're just giving the hackers another excuse

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
To try to crack your system

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Because now instead of like

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Oh I want to install Linux on it

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Now they're like, well I want to play games for other regions

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
So I'm going to hack this

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
And this is going to be my justification for doing that

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
So

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
I don't know, it sucks

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
It says

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
It looks like, for example

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
If you play a Korean 3DS game

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
With a Japanese 3DS system

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Or vice versa

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
You won't be able to play it at all

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Nintendo hasn't actually

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Responded to the comment

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
About it

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
But they haven't really said it

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
It says there's no region codes in DS and DS Lite

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
But the DSi, DSi Excel

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And 3DS have region codes

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Region codes are installed in each game

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
And the 3DS itself

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
You can't play if the region

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Codes are different

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
That's kind of lame

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Boot of that

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Region locking sucks

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I hate it

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
It's what drove me to piracy

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
On the PS1

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Was wanting to play import Japanese games

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
And I couldn't do it

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Just being honest

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
And then of course they're talking about

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Being a little bit more consistent

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
With their first party releases for the 3DS

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
They were saying that

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
With the Nintendo DS right now

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
They're not having

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
I don't know, I think they're doing pretty good

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
With the titles that they have coming out

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
They have about one or two titles

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
A month from

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Actually Nintendo

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Or maybe it's like one or two titles every few months

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Because I know, let's see

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Dragon Quest

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Is being published by Nintendo

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
And then Pokemon Black and White

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
And then they've got

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I guess they have a first party

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Wii title for January

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
But they do have Mario Sports Mix

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
For February

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
But they're saying that they're going to be

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Working to

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Have a more consistent release schedule

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
For games

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
So maybe something like once a month

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
And

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
That's kind of cool

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
And they're also targeting other regions

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
As well

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Developing countries additional to its current

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Territories to bring the new handheld

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
The new console to

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
That's good for people

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
That haven't had a lot of

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Console games, maybe Brazil

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Or

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
South America and there's some places

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Down there that could use

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Some new consoles

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I'm excited to hear

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
That they might have more of a

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Constant stream of games

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
It seemed like with the DS it was like

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Especially right after launch

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I seem to remember a lot of games didn't come out

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Almost for a year for the DS

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Here's my thing though

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Are we going to actually get

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
New games

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Or is this going to be like

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Oh yeah and we're porting this

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
We make some N64 and GameCube games

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Over and over and over again

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Look we got

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Super Mario All Stars

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
There's third party developers though

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
And I'm sort of counting on them to not do that to us

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
If that makes sense

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
The Kingdom Hearts game looks interesting

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
And there's plenty others

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Street Fighter 4 looks like it might be the biggest

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Launch game of sorts

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
And I got to admit, how sad is this you guys

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I don't even want to

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Admit this

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
I kind of want the Nintendogs plus cats

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
And I don't know why

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
No I do know why, I want the cats

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I'm not going to buy all three versions like Logie does, no way

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
No I'm not doing that either

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I learned my lesson the hard way

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
You're not even going to buy one version this time

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I'm not buying one

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Well this will make a lot of people even more excited

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
With the 3DS, like I really wish they would do this

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
And I don't know why

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Let me explain, here it is

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Nintendo did an interview with Satoru Iwata

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Called the Iwata Asks interview

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Iwata-san also

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Wants to include 3D video in the future

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
That's what Miyamoto had said

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Iwata said quote

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
I think it would be fun if we were able to include

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Video recording capabilities with future updates

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
That means it's not going to be there on release

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
But perhaps in the future

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Why?

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Why not? Let's do it

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
I mean I realize that 3D videos you can't watch them

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
A whole lot of places except maybe oh you're 3DS

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
But I don't know

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
I think that would be kind of cool

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Like in a way being able to make your own 3D videos

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Of course give it five seconds and there will be a porno

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Give it five seconds

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
And there will be a porno on the 3DS

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
But can you imagine if you could do like video sharing

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Through 3DS

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Like if Nintendo was smart

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
They would

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Introduce this whole like

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Social network file sharing ability

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Like a portal

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Where you could share videos with your friends

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
That you make on the 3DS

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Like my trip to Disneyland

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
They could have a 3D

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
YouTube

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
They could have it if they wanted it

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Do you realize how big that is?

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
With 3D being all the rage and stuff right now

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
But they don't want it

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Because they are so bullheaded

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
If Nintendo was smart

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
They would make 3D YouTube

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Before YouTube can but they won't

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Actually I think YouTube already has 3D U2

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
But the thing is

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
The difference is

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Most computers yet aren't set up to do 3D

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
The 3DS

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
It's a camera and it's the viewer

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
All in one

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Ugh

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
But no

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
They won't do it

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Yes I'm mad

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Because Nintendo just

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
They're hard headed

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Nintendo's hard headed

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
By the way there was also talk about

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
The whole street pass feature

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
As used in Nintendogs plus cats

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
And that was from Hideki Kono

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Quote, when you're using street pass and exchange data with someone

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
In walk mode

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
That person's me is walking whatever puppy he or she has chosen

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Then your me's and puppy's talk

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
And exchange gifts

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
That's supposed to be like when people actually meet

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
In the park walking their dogs

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
And what have you

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Although I've never given another dog walker a gift

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
But anyway that's supposed to be a feature

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
But I don't know I hear about this shit and I go

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Isn't that what the DS was supposed to do?

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Like wasn't your DS supposed to have that

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Always aware thing like what's so special

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
About what the 3DS is doing

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Do you have to hold the 3DS's in a certain way

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
So they can sniff each other's butts

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Is that a feature?

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Maybe I don't know

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Here's what it is to answer your question

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Remember before you had to

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Have a certain game in there and it would

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Be in that mode or whatever

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
If you had to have Nintendogs in your system

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
And they had to be in the sleep mode or whatever

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
They had to have Nintendogs

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
And it would detect them

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
This will pick up anything regardless of what game it is

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
So say for example I have Mario Kart and Nintendogs

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
And someone else has Mario Kart and Nintendogs

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
But they're playing like

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Street Fighter 4 or something like that

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
It'll still tag my system

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
With all their other crap

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
There's some clarifications from our chat room

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
At chat.orangemanstrader.com

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Tigerclaw is clarifying the 3D YouTube videos

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Are the red and blue

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
If you have the red and blue glasses you can watch some 3D videos

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
On YouTube

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Yes they have that but there's also the other ones

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
They do have multiple versions of 3D

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I think there's people making

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Self-made 3D stuff right now

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
But it's just, it's very limited

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Azzam in our chat room says

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Nintendo Smart? That's like PS3 unhackable

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
I see what you did there

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Alright

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
SalaciousPop what do you have for us?

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
I'm not sure why you put

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
This particular story in the news feed

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
It's amazing

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Because I used to work in

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Adult entertainment and I'm sure if

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Jamie got this story she would just be flustered

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
And annoyed

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
A company named D-Dub Software

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Is putting out a

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Porno, triple X rated

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Indie game called Bonecraft

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Based off of Blizzard's World of Warcraft lore

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Where it's like inspired by

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
But obviously it's close enough

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
To where they can't I guess get sued

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
But yeah so D-Dub

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Software who also put out

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Games, I'm trying to find

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Bonetown, Bonetown is another

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Game of theirs and the Tiger Woods

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Sex game I guess

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Plot summary

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Somewhere in the galaxy there's Orcs and Elves

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
This isn't a direct quote

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
I'm just paraphrasing it because otherwise it would be too long

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Orcs and Elves running around

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Space Marines crash land on the

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Planet and I guess there's something about

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Secret Elf

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Brothels and I'm sure

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
You move your mouse up and down

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
To do the sex and I don't even know what this is

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
What is this I don't even

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
But yeah, Bonecraft the World of War

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Or the Blizzard sort of

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Starcraft Warcraft genre

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Porno game

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
I love that it's combining Warcraft

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
And Starcraft together in its parody

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Yeah so for those that

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Want to

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Google that when they're by themselves

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
The door closed, that's

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
And locked, lock it

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
You lock the door

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
D-Dub Software

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
And the game is a Bonecraft

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
So that's some lol's for you there

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
An actual video game and not just a porno

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
It kind of reminds me of

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
30 Rock

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Season 3 when Tracy Jordan was

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Gonna quit television to make the most

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Amazing porn computer game of all time

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I don't know if anyone watches 30 Rock

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Maybe this is it

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
We should get the creators of this on the show

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Like let's totally take them seriously

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
And just be like you know so tell us about

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
The plot of your game like how do you

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Envision your hero

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Come on you know you want it

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Episode 400 interview with Bonecraft

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Yes or no? What do you think?

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
I think we should

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
That's gonna be the drunk show

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
What would you ask the creators of Bonecraft

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Logie? I don't know

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
I'd have to learn more about their

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Title I guess

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Well the title is Bonecraft

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
I understand that but what the hell's

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
The game I mean

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Bone town is just some really crappy

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Avatar game where people talk dirty to

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Each other I mean that's

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
It doesn't tell me anything

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Alright let's get to some

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
More stories and then the mailbag

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
And the FUs of the week are all coming right up

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I mean seriously

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
What is Bonecraft?

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
What is it?

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Um

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Alright so you know

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
PSP2

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Let's not talk about it because you know

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
No one's announced it yet but it might

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Be announced very soon actually there is

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
A rumor that the PSP2 will be unveiled

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
This month in Tokyo at a Sony

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Business meeting and it has been confirmed

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
That such a meeting is being held

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
In Tokyo on January 27

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
This was confirmed by

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Sony themselves of course they say

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
They can't comment on anything at this time

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Which probably means that yes

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
They are going to be announcing it at that time

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Um

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
So that's cool so if they announce it this year

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
I'm assuming it will probably be coming out this year

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
It'll probably be at E3 so

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Um I guess we'll have to wait and see

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
When that

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
PSP2 is coming out

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
That doesn't exist but does exist

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Yeah

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
By the way it

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Missed our show roll tonight

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
But E3 I guess is now open

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Taking registrations and all that fun stuff

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
I know because we've been kind of looking into it trying to make our plan

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
For E3 this year which sadly we

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Already know Loki's not going based on things he said

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
On the show before but uh

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
I am doing everything I can in my power to go

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
This year because you know I think I've said this before

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
On the show this year is going to be either

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
The best E3 ever or the worst

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
E3 ever I honestly

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Think because it's going to be all about

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
You know where they're going to go

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
With these new fangled things

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
They've got on consoles

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
What's next? Where's your killer app?

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I really don't think anyone's going to be announcing

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
A new console this year

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I don't think the

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Wii HD is happening at a Nintendo at this point

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Because I think they're going to really throw everything

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
They've gotten to the 3DS this year

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
It's everything you're going to be seeing

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Sony and Microsoft

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Have no reason to give up what they're doing on their

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Consoles right now so

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Well I guess the PSP2

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Would be the one console that you're probably going to see

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
More information about

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
That wasn't announced earlier

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
As we've heard it might actually come out with Tokyo Game

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Developers Conference who knows

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Could come out a lot sooner

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
It's going to be a very interesting year

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I hopped on this generation of consoles pretty late

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
I didn't get a 360

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Which is the first out of the two that I got

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Until Christmas of 08

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
So a little over two years

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
The idea that the 360 is

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Six years old or will be this summer

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
I know

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
I can't wrap my head around that

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
When the new consoles should be

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
They should be announcing a new Xbox this year

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
But it's not time

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
I don't think it's time

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
We've got at least one or two more years out of these things

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Isn't it funny that when we were sitting here

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Because the show has been on this long

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
That we have episodes dating back to when these

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Consoles were debuting and we were sitting here going

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
They're saying that PS3 has a 10 year life cycle

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Come on you're not

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
You're full of crap

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
I'm not ready to see new hardware yet

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
I'm not either

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
I'm going to be off if new hardware were out already

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Because it would be all 3D and you need 3D

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
TVs for it and

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Everything

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I don't know

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
You already made me buy upgrades to the current consoles

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
With the Kinect and the Move

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Although I didn't buy the Move

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Give me reasons to really love these things

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
If there's a game to necessitate it

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
There wasn't a game that necessitated me buying it

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
I would even argue that maybe

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
I shouldn't have bought the Kinect

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
But I do really like Dance Central and some of the other stuff

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
But I really don't have a reason to get a move right now

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
So I don't know

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
There's a lot of people out there saying

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Dark ToaGak in our chatroom says I still don't have a 360

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Are people still calling it next gen consoles?

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Because I think we're past that right?

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
I made that mistake for about two years after it was out

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Next gen

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Next gen

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
There is no next gen yet

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
We'll see

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
One person that wants to play a little more

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
In what's going on in the console world

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
It's GameStop

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
They want to link you with a GameStop ID

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
On their console

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
That's because GameStop is selling more of the digital stuff

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
In their stores

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
They had an interview with Ars Technica

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Not that long ago

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
And the Senior Vice President of GameStop, Sean Freeman

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Said that while the company is doing a good job

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Of selling Microsoft Points cards

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
They're looking to cut some of the friction

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Out of the experience

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
I'm not sure what that means

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
But what they say is that instead of buying a card

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
To go home and input the code

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Ultimately they want you to tie your online account

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
With a GameStop ID

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
So ultimately we want to reduce

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Even more of that friction

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
So when you buy that map pack in our store

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
We're going to be able to associate your Xbox profile

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
With your GameStop profile

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
And then automatically push it to your download queue

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
I still never understood

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
The reason why I would want to even do this

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Honestly

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I mean

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
If you're going to

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Say for example

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Buy download content from them

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Just buy a fucking 1600 point card

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Or something like that

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Why are you going to give them your information for this stuff

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Why do you even

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Even if you're not interested in purchasing a ton of download content

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
And you have no games to trade in

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Why the fuck would you ever

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Leave your home

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Go to a store

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
To buy something that you could just flip your console on

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
And download straight from the marketplace

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
And download straight to your console

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
And I tell you

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
By the time you drove to the store and back

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
It would already be downloaded

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
So I just don't understand

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Why you would even like

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Waste the time to go give them money

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
And you're paying tax

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
On top of that

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
I'm making stink face at this whole idea

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
To have a separate layer of

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
A GameStop ID

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
That's just yet another account that I have to sync

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
With my XBLA or whatever

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
If they want to be the middle man in that

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Password that could possibly get exploited

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Yeah this is a dumb

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Idea and I don't get it

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Well I think GameStop to some extent is doing what they feel

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
They have to do to survive

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Because I think we've said this on the show before

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
That GameStop is going to go the way of Blockbuster Video

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Real soon

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
If something doesn't happen

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Here's the thing, they're not going anywhere

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Because they're the biggest fish in the sea

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
So was Blockbuster at one time

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
No no no no

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
This is totally different because you see

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
The publisher or the movie studios

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
They don't need Blockbuster

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Like they need GameStop

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Because Blockbuster rents

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Movies, they don't sell movies

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
And unfortunately they make more money

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
In the sell through business than they do in the rental business

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
If Blockbuster was a big powerhouse

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
In selling movies that would be a different

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Different thing altogether

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
But GameStop, they're a big powerhouse

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
When it comes to sell through and unfortunately

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
They could dictate

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
To the publishers what the fuck do they want

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Them to do

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
So they say, you know what, we still want you to put physical copies out

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
They're going to put physical copies out

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
They're just trying to get into the DLC

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Stuff because they figure, hey, we can get some

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
More money from that because we can just

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Pay Microsoft or whatever

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Or a small little kickback for these things

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
But we get some money out of that transaction

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
And that's more money for us

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Because we don't actually have to sell any physical goods

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
It's digital stuff now

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
So that's what that's all about

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I mean if they really wanted to

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
I mean they have cards and stuff

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
That I guess they have made for them

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
But that's all it's about

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
It's not about them trying to survive

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
It's about them being fucking greedy

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
That's all it is

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
They don't need to be in this business at all

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Why aren't they selling

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Well I guess I should say

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Why aren't they selling PC games digitally

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
But they are

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
But I mean they're in no way going to be able to

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Compete well with Steam or something

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
It's just

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
We're looking at our comments from chatroom at chat.orangelandtrady.com

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Brad from Pod Culture says

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Used to work at Blockbuster back in the day

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
And yes Blockbuster does sell movies

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
New and used

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I know that they do but they're not like at Walmart

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Where Walmart sells hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
And hundreds and hundreds and thousands of movies

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Versus Blockbuster's

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Oh we're bringing in some extra for sell through

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
It's way different

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Way different

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
They never looked at Blockbuster as a big old

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Source of

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Profit for stuff

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Unfortunately things change

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Way back in the day one

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
It was all about VHS tapes

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
And stuff like that

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
And they were charging the Blockbuster's

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Or any video rental place

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Up to $100 per tape

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
That's where they're making the money

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
But then with the advent of DVD

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Unfortunately the cost of goods has come down

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
It's all about quantity

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
And so because of quantity

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Their business has shifted to sell through

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Where a $100 movie was

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Way out of the realm of

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Some consumer purchasing it for themselves

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
So that's why they had to rent it out

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Before it became sell through pricing

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Now everything is released at sell through

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Pricing and so there's really

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
No incentive for somebody to

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Well I mean there is an incentive for people to rent

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Stuff because it's still cheaper but

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
It's less of an incentive now because they can just

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Go to the store and buy their movie

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
New

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Because before they wouldn't be able to do that

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
So that's why it's all shifted to

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
The sell through business and that's why

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Blockbuster is

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Well it's why Blockbuster is failing

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
That and they're losing out to

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Kiosk vendors and stuff like that

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Kind of a funny comment from our chatroom

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
At chat.orangelandtrader.com

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Rama says no GameStop lost their touch when they got rid of the

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Funkoland name

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
I remember when Funkoland advertised

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
In magazines and stuff and you could get their little

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Flyer it was all like a mail order thing

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
It was the good old days

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Alright we're going to get into the mail bag here at

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Orangelandtrader.com slash mail bag

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
But just getting into the studio right now

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Dark Sakura has arrived

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Back from her event. Welcome back

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
You've been missed tonight. How are you doing?

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
I'm pinballed out

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
I played nothing but Rocky and Bullinkle and I

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Played Theater of Magic before we actually got there

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Alright and I apologize in advance

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I have to do some audio adjusting

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
On the fly because Dark Sakura and Salacious Pop are not

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
The same. Salacious Pop was using

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Dark Sakura's microphone so

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Not the same. Yes you have boobies

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Yes and they are magnificent

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Well how was the pinball event? You want to tell us real quick

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
About it? I know it was a private thing so it wasn't

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Like a public event but

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
It was pretty cool. He had a lot of good tables

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
And there was like 25 people over

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
There and Steve Ritchie was there

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
And he was really cool

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
I mentioned earlier in the show you were texting me this morning

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
That you were rubbing elbows with some famous

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Pinball peeps. That's pretty cool

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Did you give us an interview for the show?

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
No but his wife and I talked for a long time

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
And she's really sweet. Oh good

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Yeah um

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Yeah Dan's in there saying we probably could

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
He's really cool. I mean I've just

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Sat and chatted with him before at

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Convention so. Sure. What tables did he work on?

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Um he did

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
No Fear and

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Black Knight which are both ones that we have

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
And he did the voices in them. Oh right because you're

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Very proud of your autograph on those right?

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Dan just come in here and answer the damn questions

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Dan just been driving for two hours

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
You was away. You were like in the Bay Area right?

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Um actually somewhere

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Near French Camp

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Oh that's not down by Stockton. Okay

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Yeah just past Stockton. Oh you're going the other way

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
But we rode with someone in Davis

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
So that's why

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
We gave the update from Davis

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Sure sure gotcha

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
But I played a lot of Rocky and Bull Eagle

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
And there was a whirlwind

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
And uh

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Safe Cracker I think was one of them

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
And uh they have

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Really really pretty Twilight Zone

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Like with the topper and everything

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
And uh

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
All kinds of good stuff

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Rob would you like a chair?

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
And uh

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Yeah sorry for the dead air

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I'm getting hammered with chat and chairs

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Switcheroo and all that at once. Live radio folks

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
He hit him with the metal chair!

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Boom! No

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Um but it was

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
It was pretty fun and then my

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Hips started to hurt and I started to get grumpy

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
So I sat down and got on my

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Laptop for a little bit and you know

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I had a lot of beer

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Good times. So you've been drinking a little bit

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Three New Castles and a Guinness. That's not a lot

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
That's nothing for you. You should have seen me last night

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I mentioned this earlier on the show. I was out with

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Rice Princess and X-tifer and Grandpa

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Warcraft from the other show and

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Salacious Pop here. We were all out and I

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Got drunk. Like I made a

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Ass of myself in front of Rice Princess and X-tifer

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
I know I actually will. Oh sorry you were

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Muted there Salacious Pop. I'm sorry

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
I was drunk that he agreed to go to Denny's

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
For the after bar food

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I hate Denny's with a passion

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Like I just burned out on Denny's in my

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Early 20's right

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
That was the post club place to go

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Well keep in mind for the rest of you guys that aren't in California

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
We don't really have diners here

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Like diners are unheard of here. There is no such thing

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
As a waffle house. Which is a shame

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
No mom and pa diners. There's nothing like that

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
We have Denny's. Denny's, Denny's, Denny's, Denny's

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Everywhere. Well we had Lion's and we had Epi's

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
None of them are 24 hours anymore

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
And they're gone

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
It's Denny's and last night when I was drunk

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I wanted chicken strips

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
They sobered him right up

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Greasy chicken strips. They're good. Hang over here

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Well you remember my last super drunk time

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
That I was hanging out with you other than the time

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
At Tia's when they lit up in the apartment

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
And it made me throw up

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Was the waffles

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
The waffle incident

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
It's carby stuff Rob

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
It's the greasy carby stuff

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Well I guess I should pull up the chatroom

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
You'd be very proud of

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
We've gotten through most of your news tonight already

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
You'd be very proud of Salacious Pop. He did a fine job

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
He picked the classic game of the week tonight

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
What was it?

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
King's Quest IV

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Of course the Rosella game

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Which was one of the best in the series

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Figured since you tended to give

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Sega a lot of love

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Because Sega deserves my love

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Salacious Pop went to the PC market

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
We did determine today

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
On the ride back that Sega makes

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Crappy pinball tables

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag you guys

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
At mailbag

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
At orangeloungeradio.com

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
And sadly there is not a lot in the

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Mailbag tonight

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Where's my mailbag music?

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Is there Viagra spam? Because you can just read that

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Not this week

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
I'll go ahead and do it since Dark Soccer is still getting

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Do you want to be uncomfortably hard?

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Well also

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
A lot of it's my fault with the whole lack

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Of podcast feed updating

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
But again a new show went up today

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
And will continue throughout the three day weekend

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
I have tomorrow off so I'm going to work on OLR stuff

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Before I forget, 71

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Is what?

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Since we were keeping track of my levels

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Oh god

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
I already told you last night

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Alright, anyhow

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Let's get into this email from

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
RobWithTwoB's

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
And this is actually somewhat of a serious email

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Because obviously we had that tragedy that happened in Arizona

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Which is just

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Unfortunately some bonehead

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Did something really really really

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Really really bad

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
And now it's making a lot of people think

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Differently and in response

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Let me read the email here

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
From Rob

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
In response to Jared Lee Lauder gun attack

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
It appears the following article replaces video games

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
With political rhetoric

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
The article is good even though the study mentioned is weak

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
And he links us to the story from Boing Boing

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
The bottom line is that you have to be

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
A violent person to begin with

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Let me kind of go to the story real quick

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
And try to pick out some of this stuff

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Oh yeah

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
They just kind of go through

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
This study and they just replace

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
The words video games with violent rhetoric

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
And it's kind of like, gee haven't we seen this whole thing before?

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
IDK

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
But Rob

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Says my point of view and I know I've said this before in a mail bag letter

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Is that a person is solely responsible

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
For what influences him or her

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Although from what I've read of the Arizona shooting

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
The shooter was extremely mentally ill

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
And without treatment

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
We may be looking at a situation where the parents

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Did not know about paranoid schizophrenia

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
And therefore didn't get treatment for him

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Don't worry though, video games are also being blamed

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Of course, aren't they always?

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
From all with two B's

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
And it's just unfortunate, you know, in these times of tragedy

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Everybody's, you know, kind of pointing the finger

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
At what there is to blame

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
And I don't know

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
All of it's to blame to an extent

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
But what's most to blame

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Is this individual

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
An individual is responsible for their actions

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
And it's, I don't know

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
It's just, it's a

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Not an easy situation with not an easy answer to it

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
But, you know, you have to look to how to

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Prevent this type of stuff in the future

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
And we're all gonna pay for it

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Because, you know, it's not gonna be, it's gonna

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Make our Congress people less accessible

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
In the future

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
It's just unfortunate

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
And yeah, I kind of agree with Frisbee in our chat room

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
This guy is a psycho, end of line

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Yeah, that's, that's kind of how I

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Feel about it

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
There you go, that's it for the emails this week

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
I'm expecting this thing to be full next week

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Full with stories next week

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Loki has another news story

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
For us, and then we're gonna get to the Skype line

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Here in just a minute at Orangelaunchradio on

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Skype or our phone number

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Yes, last thing I have to talk

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
About, and this is not a surprise

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
I mean, I guess this is a surprise for a Wii game

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Just Dance 2 has gone

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Five times platinum, that's right

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
It sold five million copies

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
And that's not bad

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
For considering the fact it came out

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
At the end of October

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
That's way too much Kesha, for me

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
That's way too much

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
That's insane though, that it's done that well

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
I mean, yeah, to put this

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
In contrast, we just had a story earlier in the show

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Where you were saying, hey, Dance Central's doing great

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
It sold one million copies

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
We just mentioned now

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Just Dance has sold

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Just Dance 2, excuse me, has sold five

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Million copies

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
It's not like Just Dance franchise has sold five million copies

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
This one game has sold five million copies

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
That is crazy

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
It is so popular

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I'm surprised

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
That Ubisoft hasn't brought

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
The Just Dance franchise

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
To other consoles now

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
They have the Move and the Kinect stuff

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Well, the Michael Jackson game

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Isn't that really just a Just Dance Michael Jackson game?

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
It's coming out on the other systems

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
I bet you though that we'll see Just Dance 3 come out on all the platforms

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Oh, I'm sure

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
The Move would be

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Stupid easy to port

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Because it's very similar

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Kinect, a little different

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
And it's going to be hard to separate it now

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Like Dance Central kind of beat them to the punch a little bit on Kinect

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
But if Dance Central

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
And Dance Masters can kind of coexist

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
And Dance Paradise

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Oh yeah, that one

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
That's not out here, is it?

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Okay, then I guess there'll be room for this too

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
But you know what?

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Then I think I've had enough dancing games

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
They need to kill each other off in a battle royale

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
And one will be left standing

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Which will probably be Dance Central

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Get some Highlander up in this

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
For real, I want to see the head chopped off of Dance Masters

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:12.000
There can be only one

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
And make it be really good and I will buy that one

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Evacuate the dance floor

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Alright, forget it

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Moving on to one more song here

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
One more story here

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Maybe it'll have a song and dance with it

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Cooking Mama has arrived on Facebook

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
That's right

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Mama will fix Facebook now

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
The Cooking Mama franchise has arrived on Facebook this week

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Friends Cafe

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Is the name of the game

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
So we're going to dub it then Clicky Mama, right?

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Yes, Clicky Mama

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
That's right, Clicky Mama

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Don't worry, Mama will click it

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
You can visit the game at facebook.com slash

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Cooking Mama Cafe

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
It has some of the same food preparation

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Gameplay, of course

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
That you're used to seeing in the series

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
There's also unlockable upgrades

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
For your personal kitchen

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Of course, you can buy them as well

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Cause it's a Facebook game

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
And if you neglect your cafe, you will see it shut down

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Aww

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
So there you go

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
If you want to see what's going on in the Cooking Mama world

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
You can now explore that on Facebook

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
I wonder how many people will abandon Knights of the Crystals

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
To go play Friends Cafe

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
I don't know

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Oh god

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
83, I'm level 83 in that game

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
And I think Slice is Pop is actually higher than me

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Yeah, I've run out of stuff to do, really

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
In Knights of the Clicky

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Knights of the Clicky is not even a good game

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
I've already given up on it

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Why do I keep playing it?

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Rob wants help!

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Yay, thank you, I appreciate it

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
They have released new stages

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Like I just unlocked the Merman

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
From doing the underwater stages

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
So that's about all they do

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
But for every new map that they open up

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
They also release one that only requires pay items

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Of course

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
That's how it works

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
You know what? It's all going to shit when the Civilization game comes out

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
That's how I feel

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
I want that damn Civilization game now

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
That's when you'll dust off your credit card for a Facebook title

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
For real

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Alright, we're going to open up the Skypline

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
It is open right now

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
We're going to do the Effies of the Week

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
We didn't do the Effies of the Week yet

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
I'm bad

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
I did a bad thing and we didn't get the angst out

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Oh Rob, you're so bad

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I was just distracted by you getting back to the studio

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
My DJ's so bad?

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Uh, F you to my hip

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Fucker

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Done

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Slaces pop

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Um, F you I guess

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
To me not really knowing how awesome Panera Bread is

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Up until just recently

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
It's a pretty good month so far

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
No angst

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Um

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
F you to the fact that I have a very tough decision coming up

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
And I think I know what I'm going to do

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
And it's not going to make some people very happy with me

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
But in the end I know that it's the thing I've got to do

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
It has nothing to do with me

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
It has nothing to do with this program or anything you guys know about me

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
So it's just

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
I'm being cryptical on purpose

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
But I don't like these tough decisions

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
I think I know what it is

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Oh you do, I know you do

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
But sorry listeners, it's private

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Loki

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Uh, F you to my JTAC constantly being broken

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
And it was really broken

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
I actually sent it away to be re-balled

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Which is where they pull the chips off

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
And they put new solder balls on them

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
They actually have lead in them

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
How they should have been

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
And that didn't even fix it

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
So uh

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
It's broke

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Alright

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
That's going to do it for the FUs of the week

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Let's go to the Skype line but we're going to start the Skype line tonight

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
With something a little special

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
We're actually going to place a call right now

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
And uh

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Get him on the line here

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
So we can get an update on what's going on

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
With one of our partner shows

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Hi Breslil are you there?

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
What? Huh? Breslil how you doing?

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Hi Hi

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Hi Hi

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Guy? Hi

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
What? What? Oh shit

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Alright Breslil is helping out with a big old

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
To do thing at Under Sedation Live

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
They're our pals and buddies and I say that mostly

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Because that's the show I started on

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
And they are live of course Saturday nights here

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
At All Games Radio and uh

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
We like to help out with a little thing called

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
USLOLR Madness

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Yeah and it's

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
I have learned something I am not expanding it

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
To 96 games next year

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
There's a lot of shit that gets in there honestly

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
I voted on the

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Current brackets and there's some weird shit in there

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Yeah it's because people

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
People like SSJ-100

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Matt say hey Blade's a steal number one

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
And then it gets a 12 seed

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
So anyways

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Voting for the Breslil region

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Actually closes in about half an hour

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
For the first region it will close

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
And then I'll announce the

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Next line of games when we get into the real meat

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
And potatoes basically Chrono Trigger comes

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
To play that's all that happens

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
But I have some scores here of some games

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
I thought you all would be interested in

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Alrighty

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
So I'll start with the OLR region because it's your

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Region

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Secret of Mana

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Is beating Katamari

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Namashe right now

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
It's pretty close. Quake is losing

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
To Half Life

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
I'm okay with both of those

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Sometimes and the weird thing about

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
USL Madness is that sometimes the pairings

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Are really hard early on

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
And you know that's true of any tournament

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Comp style competition but sometimes the pairings

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
This early on like Quake vs

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Half Life those are both games that deserve

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
To move on but just the way the brackets are set up

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
It's not gonna happen you know

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
And um

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
What else was I gonna say about that you know

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
It's like Mega Man 2 vs Mega Man 3 last year

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
That was just probably one of the toughest decisions

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
I had to make

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
At that point you know there really only

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Needed to be one Mega Man game that represents

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Them all you know

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Yeah but moving on the last one

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
And this is a Bemani one so I had to throw it in there

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Para Para Paradise is

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Narrowly losing to Sinistar right now

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
That is such a weird

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Match up

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Yeah I don't know how that works

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
You know what though as much as I love my

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Dancy games I don't think Para Para

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Is the dancy game I would choose to represent

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Sorry Misty I know you're gonna hate me for that

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
But Sinistar did bring us the whole

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Beware I live

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Which is pretty awesome

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Moving on to the Harper region

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Wow is barely beating Bionic Commando

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
It's by like a vote

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Wow

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Yeah exactly

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Pong is beating System Shock

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
And probably the most bizarre first round

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Match up and it's beating it pretty soundly

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Here's a head scratcher

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Kingdom Hearts is beating

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Markham Asylum

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Interesting

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Well I

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Knowing the listeners of this show

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
That mostly prefer the import

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Stuff I mean if I were to say you know the majority

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Of the listeners not all of them but I know the majority

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Of our folks are kind of into the

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Squeenix import stuff that doesn't

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Surprise me

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
I can't speak for USL but I know we have

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
A lot of the same listeners so it wouldn't surprise me

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
I got sick of Kingdom Hearts

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Pretty quickly but that's just me

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Over to the Donovan region and the other

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Bmoni game in this region

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
If you're wondering where the hell DDR is

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
DDR got a 3 seed so it gets a buy

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
In the first round it doesn't get to play

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
But Popin' Music

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Is playing Perfect Dark and

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
It's not looking good for Popin' Music

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
As it

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
As it doesn't need to be

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Looking good for it

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
And speaking of Blades of Steel it's losing

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
To Dragon Quest 9 right now pretty badly

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Ouch

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
This is one of the Brestler region I'm also not saying

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
All of these games because it would be 32

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Matchups we'd be here forever and Rob, Jamie

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
And Loki have things to do tonight

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Where can you kind of like

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Follow the action on what's going on

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
At USL Madness

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
I haven't been posting the

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Results but

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Time and again I will every day post

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Like oh hey this matchup's close

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Or this region needs votes like the OLR

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Region really needs votes right now so

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
And then I'm gonna

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Finally go to the Brestler region here

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Final Fantasy 10

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Is just barely beating

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Crazy Taxi

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Borderlands

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Is beating the ever loving snot out of the

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Call of Duty series

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Good

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Yeah that one was like

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
That could go either way but I wouldn't be

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Upset if Borderlands went and then here's

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Probably the most interesting one, Techno Super

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Bowl is losing to Halo Reach

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
By about 10%

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
No that's not

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
That is not even the Halo game that should be

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Representing the Halo franchise I'm sorry

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Halo 2 all the way

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
If it was Halo 2 beating it then I'd be a little more

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Sympathetic but Halo Reach no

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
No

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
But those are just some of the matchups

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
If you want to vote I will post the link

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Again in chat if you're listening live

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
The Brestler region closes in

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
20 minutes

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
So you better vote now bitches

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Yeah Donovan regional closed

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Monday night, Harper regional closed Wednesday

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Night and since it was late on OLR

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
OLR region will close Friday night

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Alright and you'll be posting all the updates

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
In our forums at orangeandlongestrader.com correct?

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Yes and probably here before

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
You guys sign off I will have the results of the Brestler

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Region so you see what games go on and what

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Faces what so Alright sounds good

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Thank you for putting this all together it sounds

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
It's a little fun nerd stuff but fun

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Yeah

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
I gotta ask before I go who do you

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Got this year who do you think is gonna win? Who do I think

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Is gonna win this year? Duh Super Metroid

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
It needs to reclaim the throne of course

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
I wouldn't

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Be upset if Final Fantasy 6 won

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
For a game

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Because Final Fantasy 6 has never won before

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Right? No it got to the finals for the

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
First time last year I would be okay with that

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
What other games have gotten really close but haven't won

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Yet

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Link to the past

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Ocarina of Time

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Super Mario Brothers

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
And Mega Man 2 all have gotten really close

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
I would be okay with any of those

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Winning the whole thing except for

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Ocarina of Time

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
I'm gonna start

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Ocarina of Time is just like Chrono Trigger

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
To me I don't understand everybody's hard on

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
For it I don't

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Link to the past forever

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Yeah but anyways guys

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
That's it I will

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
I will talk to you guys probably next week here

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
And y'all have a good night Alright YouTube

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Have a good one and good luck with the

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
And keep Donovan

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
And Jessica Harper in check for us

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
I'll try

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Alright later

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Later

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Alright if you want to give us a call the skype line is now open

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000

187 game OLR

Or our user name on skype is Orange Launch Radio

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Let's go right to the phones cause they've been ringing while we were on that last call

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Hello you're

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Hey what's up guys

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
This is Kaijuto Hey Kaijuto there you are

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
What's up buddy

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Not much I just called to recommend

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
The game to you guys Please do what game?

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
It's a PC game

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
It's first person shooter I heard you all

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Talking about you were fans of

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
The original GoldenEye for the N64

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
The original GoldenEye was pretty badass I liked it

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Alright well then

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
You need to pick up this mod you need

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
You need Steam of course you need

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Either Half Life 2

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
I'm not gonna get into all of the games but you know what I'm saying

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
When I say you need a Valve game you need Half Life 2

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Or Portal

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Or Team Fortress you know one of those

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Actually is it Team Fortress I'm not sure

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Just get Half Life 2 Deathmatch which is just $4.99

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
You get that and then you can

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Download this GoldenEye source mod

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Which is the best freaking game

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Period that I've ever played

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
I think you all need to check it out

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Interesting you're a big Half Life fan

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
I am hugely into Half Life 2

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
And the source

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Half Life 2 engine I've played a ton of

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Mods and add-ons

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Expansions that are fan made for Half Life 2

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
And I know exactly what he's talking about

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I haven't checked it out

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
But yeah I will now

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
I've heard of this it looks pretty awesome

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Yeah they just went out of beta

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Maybe people have played it before

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
You know I guess it was version 2

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Version 3 and maybe they didn't like it

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
But this new update

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
The release version

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Oh my god it'll blow you away

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
The maps are just incredible

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
The first person shooter maps you'll ever play

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
And the first person shooter to date

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
And I mean that

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I'll ban myself from all games

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
If you guys don't like that game

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
That's how dedicated I am

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
You don't have to do that

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Everybody has different opinions

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
I'll check it out especially if it's kind of cheap

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I think I already have Half Life 2

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I can't remember if I have it on PC

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
I think I've been playing it on Xbox

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
But I have Portal and Team Fortress

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Portal should be enough

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Any game that uses the Source SDK

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
In the Half Life 2 family

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Will let you run this add-on

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
So Portal should do it

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
I guess I'll have to check that out

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
And we'll see if this guy gets banned

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
From all games forever

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Me mishearing you for a second

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
I mean it though

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
You really need to check that game out

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
I think these guys need to be supported

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
I think they spent about 5 years making this mod

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
And it really shows

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I mean the maps

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
They had the original maps from the N64 game

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
And then they built their own maps

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
And you're just like

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
How the heck can they do all this

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
It's just really great

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Well I'm all for supporting the community

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
But Dark Soccer, what did you want to say?

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
I misheard you when you said Team Fortress

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And for a moment it sounded like you said Team Fortress

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
So now I'm thinking about

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
A big deathmatch game with a bunch of angsty teenagers

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Wouldn't that just be Battle Royale?

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Team Titans

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
You're giving me a mod idea now

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Seriously there should be a Battle Royale mod

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Like you have the jock

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
And then you have the emo kid

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
And you have the goth

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Well you know the emo kid would just be busy cutting himself

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
His hair of course

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Breakfast club frag edition

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Yeah

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
I mean you've got your different classes

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Your clicks

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
And they're a different class

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
The cheerleader

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Is athletic and can kick people in the face

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
And has the booby attack

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Nice

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
And then there's the football player

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Who's like really big and stupid

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Well Kaijuto

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I'm definitely going to have to check out this GoldenEye mod

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Because I did enjoy the GoldenEye on the 64

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
I even really enjoyed what I played

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
The Wii version at E3

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
I didn't want to plunk down 50 bucks for it

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
But maybe when it goes to the bargain bin

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
I'll probably check it out a little more

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Just because my Wii is not really my gaming console

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Of choice right now

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
It's still in a box from when I moved a year ago

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Sad

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
I played the Wii version first

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
And then when I got it on GoldenEye source

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
It totally dwarfed the Wii's version

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
The online part of it

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
I mean they don't have a story version

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
And I do like the Wii's story version of GoldenEye

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
But multiplayer

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
There's nothing like it

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
You really need to check it out

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
When I last heard of this GoldenEye mod

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Specifically it was still in alpha

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
This was months and months ago which is why I never checked it out

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
But the one Half-Life 2 mod

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
I really need to come out this year

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Is Black Mesa

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
The Half-Life 1 remake

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
That's been vaporware for six years

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Now that this GoldenEye

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Is actually in beta and going to have a release

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Version soon

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
This needs to light the fire

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Under the butt of those that are working on Black Mesa source

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
I need it to happen

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Well unfortunately we lost the caller there

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
I don't know if he accidentally hung up on us

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Or if there was a connection issue

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
I swear I didn't click a button to hang up on him

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
And we will definitely check out that game

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
In the future

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
So our Skype line is back open again

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
1877 Game OLR is our phone number

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
You can give us a call

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
I'll just throw over to Loki real quick

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
If you have any last minute stories you want to throw out there

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
I don't know

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Just real quick, Arcade Infinity is not closing after all

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
That's right

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
There's a story about that on our very own website

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
And yeah they still had a big party this weekend

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Just to kind of celebrate

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
So that's good

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Well congratulations to Arcade Infinity

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Hopefully it's not like

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Only open for three more months and then

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Psych we closed again

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Well it was some weird thing where like it was actually the city

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
That didn't want them to stay open

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Yeah I heard about that

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Something about their business license being really expensive

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Well let's go to the phones because we got another call on the line

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Hi caller you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
This is Brad from Pod Culture

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Hey Brad I haven't heard from you in a long time

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
How are you doing buddy?

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
I'm going bald

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Sounds like me

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Well what's new in your world?

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
DC Universe Online

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Ah of course there's a lot of nerds

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Very happy that this is out this week

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
What do you think?

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
I'm loving it

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
It's still got its issues

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Like any of those kind of games at launch

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
But I am really digging it

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Because I am a huge kind of nerd

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
PS3 or PC?

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
PS3

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Actually the way the controls

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Feel

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
It actually feels like it's made for

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
A console

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
You're actually right in that regard

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
I think because even when I was playing it on the PC

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
I plugged in the Xbox 360 controller

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Which is a little weird because the game wasn't made for that

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
But it works

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
And what's really interesting too is that when you do

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Plug in the joystick all the little button

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Symbols change to the Playstation

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
X's and O's

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Which is weird if you're using a 360 controller

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
You've been gaming long enough

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
You know where those buttons are by

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Feel

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
So cool, are you playing a hero or a villain?

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Right now playing a hero

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
And how's that going?

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
What level are you?

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
I am about back up to where I was with the beta

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
I think I'm level 12 or 13

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Nice

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
It was a little bit of an ordeal to get my game

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Oh no

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Amazon screwed up a shipment

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Do you notice there's a lot of people

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
In that right now?

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
I'm getting knocked off

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Every once in a while

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Having some connection issues

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
So I don't know if it's my end here

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Or just that everybody

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Happens to be on the crisis server

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Or not

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
How much patching

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Did you have to do that first day?

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Oh the first day I had about an 11 gig

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Download

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Oh my gosh, 11 gigs?

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
It seemed like it, it took a long time

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
That is

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Crazy, wow

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Well how is it playing an MMO on the PS3?

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
Do you think MMOs can work on the PS3?

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Now that this, you know, big

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Cause I think this is kind of the first one

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
There was APB I guess, but this is really

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
One of the first big ones I guess that's out

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
If they can make it

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
This kind of a controls game

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
It could probably work

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
It's pretty nice

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Are you able to talk to

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Other people okay?

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
You do not need to do that in your experiences

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
With DC Universe online

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Do you use a keyboard or?

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
You can, I went out and got the

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Keypad for the

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
PS3 controller

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
But

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Apparently you can do some chat

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
But it's a little weird to get it set up and working right

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
You can just use your Bluetooth

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Headset

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Do you find that the text, you can actually read it

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Cause one of the complaints I've heard about the PS3

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Version is that the text is very small on

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
It is a little small but I've got a

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Fairly good size

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
TV so

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
It's alright, it's a little small maybe

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
If you've got a little bit of vision

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Issues you might have a problem

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
But I'm not seeing too much of a

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Problem with it

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
What kind of audience would you recommend

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
This game to? Do you think everybody should be checking

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
It out or is this only for the hardcore right now

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Or what?

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
I mean if you like

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
City of Heroes

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
That kind of stuff, it's definitely worth checking out

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Alright

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
I think I might have to check this out but

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Gosh, games are so expensive these days

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
And I already have one MMO I'm subscribed to

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
I don't need $30 a month

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
To play MMOs, boy oh boy

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Yeah but you can get a good one now

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Nice, I see what you did there

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Alright well Brad, we gotta let you go

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
But do you have any other thoughts for us?

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Nope, nope, just keep on doing what you're doing

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
And we'll keep listening

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Alright thank you so much and check out Brad's show

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
It's available at podculture.net

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Podculture.net and

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Soon to be podculture.com

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Cause we are switching over to a new host

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
We're gonna be an indie show again

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Nice, alright well welcome to the indie

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Realm I suppose and

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
You can of course always look him up on iTunes

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Which is kind of the king of podcasts there

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Alright, take care everybody

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Later guys

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
It's good to hear from Brad, it's been a very long time

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
We've heard from Brad, so glad to hear

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
He's back into gaming with whatever

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
We can probably do at least

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
One more call here, 1-877-GAMELR

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Our username on Skype is

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
OrangeLoungeRadio

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
We'll get to at least one more call here before we wrap it up

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Any other last minute stories?

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Uh, I'm sure

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
I do have some

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Let's see here

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Of course I don't have them pulled up

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
Oh that's alright

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
You're saved by the Skype line, but get those up

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
While we take this last call

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Oh you seem to always know how to get through

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
What's on your mind buddy?

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Not too much, um

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
In reference to Funko Land, you got me

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Thinking way back

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
As a little kid

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
In elementary school

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Reading the magazines, hearing about the

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Fun Club, going out

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Getting boxes, packing up

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
My Nintendo games, calling

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Them, getting the prices

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Packing it up, sending it to them

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Waiting about a week and a half

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Getting some brand new

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Nintendo games and playing them for hours upon hours

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Oh yeah, that's how

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
I got my copy of Ultima 3 Exodus

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
On the NES was through Funko Land

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
It's not like I remember

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Playing Renegade a long time ago

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Then I remembered that game sometime later

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
And I started getting my hands on that

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
And I believed Dragon Warrior 3

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Uh huh

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
That was my thing

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
It got to the point where I couldn't

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Get all the games I wanted

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
I figured I had all these stacks of games

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Might as well do something with it

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
And then I find out there's a Funko Land

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
And then during my

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Junior high and high school years

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
That was my hangout spot

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
I would go there all the time

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
I met a lot of friends and stuff like that

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
And then eventually I stopped

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Going because half the managers got sent

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
To different stores and the newer managers

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Are assholes, so I was like

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
There was no point in going

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
And then one day I just happened to roll in there

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
And I go to the front counter

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
And I'm like, can I get a price sheet?

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
And they're like, we don't do price sheets anymore

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
And you have to go to the back of the line

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
And I turn around

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
I see this long line of people

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
And I said, to hell with this, and I walked out

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Ha ha ha ha

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
So is there a GameStop

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Where that Funko Land used to sit?

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Yeah

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Yeah, it really is

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
And

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Where I used to live, one of my best friends

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
From high school, he finally told me

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
Like, maybe about six months or so ago

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
They finally turned the

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
Software, etc. in our old shopping center

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Into Funko Land

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Ha ha ha

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Wow

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Yeah, I didn't think it would take like 15 years

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
For them to change the logo on the front

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Uh

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Yeah, you know, there's a store in

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Where was it that we were at?

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
It was in Oregon, and we were in what

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
Was it Ashland? No, Medford

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
Is the city right north of Ashland

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
When we went inside, it was a GameStop

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
It was just a GameStop

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
They had the white neon software, etc.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
And it was like 1993 again

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
I know, and I had to buy a game there

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Because I'm like, dude, it's a software center, I gotta buy a game here

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
But even the receipt on it said GameStop

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
It was sad

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Well, slowly everything becomes a part of the machine

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
What do you think about the GameStop ID, though?

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Let me ask you that real quick

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Since you brought up that whole thing

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Because I'm anti-GameStop in the first place

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
You're anti the man

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Stick it to the man

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Yes, I'll say it once, I'll say it again

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Fuck GameStop

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Alright, well on that note, we're gonna let you go, buddy

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Cool

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
But have a good one

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
Reminiscing about the good old days with

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
DJ Rama S

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Any other last minute stories?

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Loki?

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Um, yeah, a couple things

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
This is actually kind of funny

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
2, you know, the new one that's coming out on PSP

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
They're actually selling it in a 2-pack

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
In, um,

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Japan

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
It's a double enlistment pack

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
It contains two UMD copies of the game

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
In their full packaging

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Bundled together for

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:54.000
6,279 yen

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Versus

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Buying two 5,040 yen copies

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
So you're saving almost

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Almost the price of one whole copy

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Nice, I like these whole

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Buy multiples, get one free

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Alright, I lied, we're gonna take one more call

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Because it's still ringing

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
So I guess I don't know why everybody wants to call tonight

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Some nights we're sitting here begging for calls

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
But some nights, we got a busy line

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
So, hi, you're on Orange on Australia, who's this?

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
This is the head of the anti-Bimani

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
In the USL Madness tournament

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Hi, Bobby, how are you?

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
I'm doing good

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
You guys have a good show tonight

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Yeah, I'm having a good time

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
I hope you've had a good time listening

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
You always have us on at the end of your show

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
So I'm always happy when you're able to get in

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Amongst the Skype Madness and be on the end of our show

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
That's right

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
I want everybody to vote against Poppin

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
And Para Para

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
And DDR, which got a buy

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
How did that even get in there?

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
Because too many people put it up towards the top of their list

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
You have to remember, our station started as a museum

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
So a lot of the people

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
We have a lot of players, the thick and thin

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
And some of the tough decisions we've made

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
But we do have a lot of fans of that

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
And, obviously, USL has their listenership as well

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
But I know a lot of it is crossover

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
This show, in some ways, was a spinoff of USL

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
So we have many listeners from back in that day

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
And I'm gonna say

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
I'm like you, I wouldn't be mad

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
If Final Fantasy VI won

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
As long as Super Metroid doesn't win

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Oh, hater, why you hating?

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Why you hating on Super Metroid?

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Because it sucks

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
It does not suck

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
It's the most amazing video game ever made

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Why are you hating on Super Metroid?

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Because Super Metroid mimics a vacuum

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
Is it sad that I actually had to stop and think about that one for it?

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
I'm like, you don't play in a vacuum

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
What are you talking about?

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Oh, you Bobby

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Curse you, Bobby

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Bobby, you just launched a new website for your show, right?

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
I did, bobbyblackwolf.com

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
And the podcast is back

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
The podcast feed is more up to date than ours

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
But that will all change this week

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Here's the thing, my episode from tonight

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
Already on the podcast feed

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
Wow, amazing

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
That hasn't happened in three years

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Good gosh

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
You need to cancel doing second shows more often

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Exactly

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
And I reviewed the Telltale game Back to the Future

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
On my show

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
So people can go check that out

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
I guess we have to go check it out to see what you really think

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
But I was gonna say

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
Earlier, I'm really looking forward to the Jurassic Park game

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
I don't know why, but

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
I think it's because I like the books when I was younger

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
And I remember seeing the original movies

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Except three, who bothered with three

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
But I'm kind of excited

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
To revisit those

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
Because it's been a long time since those movies were out

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
And that whole

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Stuff was big

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
They never did make a fourth movie

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
I don't know if they were ever going to

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
But it would be kind of fun to revisit that world, I think

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Yeah, and one of the things is when Heavy Rain came out

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
I even said

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
I would love to play a Telltale game like

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Sam & Max using the Heavy Rain style of

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Controls

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
And now that's what they're going to be doing for

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Jurassic Park

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Doing more Heavy Rain type stuff

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Than just point and click adventures

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
And hopefully if it works for Jurassic Park

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
They'll do that in Sam & Max

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
And probably add some of that

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
Will there be a Jason scene in Jurassic Park?

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
Jason!

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
And I want to see a T-Rex holding a red balloon

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
And it's going

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
And it's going

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
And it's going

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Jason!

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Can't wait

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Alright Bobby, anything else on your mind tonight

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Before we wrap up our little show here?

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
No, I mean

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Breslow wants to kick me, but once again

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Vote against DDR

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
He'll deal with it

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
Every gamer has a voice

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Even when they're wrong, like you are

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
All I gotta say is the next

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Was it Poker Night

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
At the inventory or whatever?

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
It's going to be awesome

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Was it Christopher Lloyd

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
And a T-Rex

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
And a Velociraptor

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
I'm the whole Jason

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Alright

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Bobby, thanks so much for your call

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Take care

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
Thank you

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Bobby Blackwolf, the man who does the show before us

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
You go all in on the next Poker Night

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
At the inventory at the Velociraptor

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
He's so pissed, he just eats strong bad

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Violently, gruesomely

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
That's great

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Alright, any other last minute stories

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Before we wrap up the show tonight

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Minecraft has sold a million copies

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Which is pretty awesome

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
They have a new update for that

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
As well that adds

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
I still haven't played it, am I a bad gamer?

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
I haven't really played it either

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
I'm a bad gamer

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Let's see

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
They added

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
Some new recipes including

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Squids and cake

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Yes

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
So you can get cake in the game

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
And I guess squids are a new enemy of course

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
So that's pretty cool

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
And yeah I guess from the squids

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
You can harvest black ink

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
For a new dye mechanic

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
Let's see what else

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
Remedy is bringing Death Rally

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
For the iPhone

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
Death Rally you may remember

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
As an old

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Apogee game

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
Back from 1996

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Kind of a top down

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Combat racing game

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Which is kind of cool

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
And then speaking of

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
IOS, the iPad has

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
A bunch of ridiculous peripherals

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
That were being shown off at

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
CES and of course

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
One of these is the

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
iCade which transforms to your

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
iPod or your iPad I guess

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Into an arcade and you can get that ThinkGeek

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
For $100 or if you don't want to

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Spend $100 but you still want

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Some sort of tactile controller

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
They have a stick on

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Joystick actually

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
For $25 and it just

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Sticks onto your

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
iPad

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
Maybe Apple should release one

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
I think they should

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Honestly I think they should have something

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
The iPhone or whatever plugs into

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Apple if they want to just do Bluetooth

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Support for controllers or something

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
That would be awesome

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
It's what the people want

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Now that Verizon has their iPhone they're just going to sell even more

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Of them and it's just like if they were to release

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
Just a little controller that plugs into

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
The bottom of those phones I tell you it's over

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Yeah

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
So

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Is that it? That's it

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Alright well that's going to do it for another episode

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000

We can't finish up the show though

We want to get everybody's final thought

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
So let's just pop I'll start with you

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Thank you for filling in tonight stepping up to the plate

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
I know you didn't get a lot of notice on that

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
So I appreciate you doing that for us

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
My pleasure

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
And do you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
Um no I'm good

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Vietnamese noodles after this yay

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
And we had blood orange pinkberry

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Blood orange pinkberry is the best thing ever

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
So good

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
That is my final thought blood orange pinkberry

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
If you have a pinkberry anywhere near you

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
I've never had better yogurt in my life

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
It is great they need to keep that as a permanent flavor

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
If they get rid of that I'm going to be pissed

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
Yeah I'm excited about food again

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
Uber noms

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
Darsakra your final thought tonight?

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
I had a lot of beer today

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
Congratulations and Loki your final thought tonight

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
My final thought is

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
This umm

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Aliens game looks weird

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
Oh that whole square

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
one that was designed back in the day

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
It looks like

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
I don't know like a side scrolling

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Metal gear or something

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
Alright that's going to do it

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
