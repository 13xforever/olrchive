00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,400
Tonight, January 23rd, 2011, the 3DS US launch gets some details, Final Fantasy games get

2
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,400
sequels and new names, and after over a decade we finally have a release date for Duke Nukem

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,400
Forever.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:35,280
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,000
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,040
We are live with our 398th episode on this January 23rd, 2011.

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,720
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you every week.

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,640
With me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
Hi.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
How are you, Dark Sakura?

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
I have hobbit shoes.

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
How are you?

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
Am I not hearing you at all?

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Am I muted?

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
The fabulousness of live radio.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
Try again.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
La, la, la.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Much better.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Okay.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm wearing my hobbit shoes.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
What is the hobbit shoes?

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,040
I have Vibram five finger multi-sport shoes.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,800
They're the shoes that look like feet.

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
They're not really shoes.

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
I'll take a picture.

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,160
They're like Spiderman webbing that go on your feet and they're the strangest things.

27
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
They're foot gloves.

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,280
They're the strangest things I've ever seen.

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,840
But they're comfortable and when they break in they're supposed to be really good for

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,560
your feet and give you a natural stride.

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,880
Would you play DDR in those?

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Yeah.

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Yeah.

34
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
I've seen people do it before.

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Might be interesting.

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
But I'm gonna take a...

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,880
Play some Dance Central.

38
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
Shake your booty.

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
I'm not gonna play Dance Central.

40
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm gonna play Dance Masters.

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
Really?

42
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
You wouldn't...

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
Oh, Dance Central's great.

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Hara-para.

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,600
Dance Masters gets old after like the first five songs you play.

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
I don't care.

47
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Don't care.

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
All right.

49
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Whatever.

50
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Let's see if Tech Master Loki cares.

51
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Hi, Loki.

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
I don't care about Dance Masters.

53
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
And we don't hear you either.

54
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
What is going on?

55
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,840
It's called ill preparation.

56
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Apparently.

57
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,680
I don't know what this is all about tonight.

58
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,160
Plus that mic.

59
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Everyone's up with it.

60
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
I don't know.

61
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
You've been getting quieter and quieter every week.

62
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,560
It's because I'm talking quieter and quieter.

63
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,160
They get really loud!

64
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,360
Exactly.

65
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,160
That's why we have to be careful how we tune it for you.

66
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
I do that on purpose.

67
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
All right.

68
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Well, how's your week been, Loki?

69
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
It's been fine.

70
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
Yeah?

71
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Good times.

72
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,960
Anything exciting going on with the baby?

73
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Growing?

74
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Getting older?

75
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
He's eating some...

76
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
He's starting solid foods, I guess.

77
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,800
I saw the avocado post.

78
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,040
He's eating avocado, rice cereal, and...

79
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,120
What else?

80
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,640
When's it okay to start feeding a baby bacon?

81
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
Not for a long time.

82
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,200
Oh, what a bummer.

83
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
He's getting...

84
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Well, it's avocado, rice cereal, and...

85
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Cheerios!

86
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,800
I think that's actually it, avocado and rice cereal.

87
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,320
But then he's going to be eating, I think, carrots this week.

88
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
All right.

89
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, good luck in the baby adventures.

90
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,840
Anyhow, we're going to get into how we always like to start off the show.

91
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,000
How was your gaming week?

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,240
But first, of course, I want to introduce the chat room.

93
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,260
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com with us here every week.

94
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,800
The always present fourth guest on the show, as we say.

95
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,360
And lots of people making the connection.

96
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,200
I'd written a tweet about this earlier on my Twitter account.

97
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,240
Episode number 400, the way things are right now, will end up being the same day as the

98
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
Super Bowl.

99
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,560
That's just great.

100
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
That's just fabulous.

101
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Our 400th episode is going to be the same day as the Super Bowl.

102
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,600
I don't know if we really have anything exciting planned, though.

103
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
I mean, it's just...

104
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
I don't know.

105
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
It's just...

106
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
After this long...

107
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,840
I have something exciting planned.

108
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,240
I know you've got a little, a little something.

109
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,160
But both of you need to actually stay instead of depart super quick after the show.

110
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,720
I've offered, I don't know how many times, but anyway.

111
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,800
You're not the one I'm worried about, Loki.

112
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,160
All right, but anyway, besides all that stuff, 400 is coming up.

113
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,080
And I don't know if we're doing anything too exciting, special.

114
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,280
You know, I don't know.

115
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,480
After however long we've been doing the show, nine years or whatever, the self-congratulatory

116
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,580
episodes, there's been enough of them.

117
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,580
So we'll see.

118
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,080
500 is the really big deal, or 10 years, whatever comes first, which I guess would actually

119
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,340
be 10 years.

120
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,600
But anyway, enough of that.

121
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,400
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games you have been playing

122
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
this week.

123
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

124
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,200
Um, I made level 75 on World of Warcraft.

125
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
And got two of my friends to play.

126
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Addict.

127
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,160
Now I'm the dealer.

128
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
Um...

129
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,120
That's what pyramid scheme I say.

130
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Pyramid head scheme.

131
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
Ah.

132
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,000
And, uh, I played some Portal.

133
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,840
And uh, some more Mushihime-sama.

134
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
And lots of Solitaire.

135
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,300
Because I was at school.

136
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,320
And I updated and installed my own Linux Mint 10 by myself.

137
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,000
On two computers.

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,480
And fixed the networking problems.

139
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,860
Now, I know I've heard you talk favorably of Linux Mint before as something you like

140
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,600
to use as another OS besides just, you know, Windows.

141
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,040
What is the advantage, I guess, of doing Linux on one system and Windows on the other?

142
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,080
Specifically in the case of my netbook, it uses less memory and less space.

143
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,080
And if I need to, I can actually boot it off of a USB that I've installed Linux on.

144
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,960
So say that, you know, this computer that I'm on now, say that something goes haywire

145
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,960
in it, all I have to do is boot it off of Linux and I can run through the file system.

146
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,300
And if I need to delete something, I can.

147
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,420
Good times.

148
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,420
It works on everything.

149
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,420
Well, it makes sense.

150
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,880
Uh, there's some folks in our chat room talking about episode 400, by the way.

151
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,420
SalaciousPop in our chat room says, episode 400 is going to be a drunk show, I thought.

152
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,420
That's right.

153
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,420
We had mentioned something about that, hadn't we?

154
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,420
Yes, we have.

155
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
Perhaps.

156
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,420
Maybe that will happen.

157
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
Um...

158
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,720
And then, uh, SSJ100Matt says, we need Rice Princess and Extifer for episode 400.

159
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
We'll see.

160
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,160
We invite them, they'll make it all about them.

161
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,560
If you listen to Hoard House, you'll know, so.

162
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
We'll see.

163
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
We'll see.

164
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Nothing is impossible.

165
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,880
So that's it for Dark Soccer's Gaming Week.

166
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
We'll move on over to Loki.

167
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
How was your gaming week?

168
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Um, it was okay.

169
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,720
I played a couple things, um, I tried, I don't know, just for the hell of it, I tried that

170
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,800
one, um, free game that was made by that 14-year-old or something like that, some bubble something

171
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,160
or other.

172
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,400
And, um, it was okay for a few minutes and then I was like, wow, this looks like a really

173
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,160
cheaply made game.

174
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,600
And I got bored with it.

175
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Why do you think it's doing so well?

176
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,200
This is that iPhone, iTouch game.

177
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,160
I hope because people like fucking human interest stories and because people are simpletons

178
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,920
and they like free shit and as long as it has a good storyteacher, well, I better support

179
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
it because the 14-year-old made it.

180
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Great.

181
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,760
You know, 14-year-olds make a lot of shit.

182
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Usually.

183
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Yeah.

184
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,120
Um, but, you know, whatever, you know, these are the same people like Angry Birds, so,

185
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:50,760
you know, one of my, it's not a stretch for them, I guess, um, then I, I literally dusted

186
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,280
off my PS3, uh, to finally put the 500, those things are dust magnets.

187
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,520
You don't dust them off, they'll turn gray.

188
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Yeah.

189
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:07,960
So, um, I dusted it off and I finally installed my 500 gig hard drive that I had for it and

190
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:15,040
then I, um, did the noble thing and I installed a custom firmware on it and now all my systems

191
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,600
are modded as they should be.

192
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,760
You're so proud.

193
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,680
It was seriously the black sheep of the bunch and, you know, now, now it's all perfect.

194
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,640
And I know I've read stories about systems bricking and stuff like that, but seriously,

195
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,120
if you just wait a little bit to make sure everything's okay, let the dust settle, you're

196
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
all good.

197
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,040
And it's so easy to do, it's seriously scary.

198
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:47,280
Um, so I did that and then, um, played a little bit of Planet 2, a little bit of that, um,

199
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,360
just a few levels and then a couple, actually just one online level and, um, it's fun.

200
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,200
I like Little Big Planet 1, I mean, that was a fun game, and Little Big Planet 2, obviously

201
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,360
very similar to that, they have some new features that they added in there.

202
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't really care for the grappling hook too much and, and I don't know if it's just

203
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,600
the design of the, you know, Dualshock 3 analog sticks or something like that, but for some

204
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,520
reason I was having issues with it trying to, you know, swing my character back and

205
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,000
forth and having the grappling hook, you know, change length, which would normally be controlled

206
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,360
by the up and down on the analog, even though I'm not pushing up and down on the analog,

207
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,280
it was just very, the dead zones for it were really, um, really large, I guess.

208
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,680
So it was difficult to accurately get it to swing and adjust the, you know, size of the

209
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,460
grappling hook and stuff like that.

210
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,160
So it actually killed my character one time, but it's alright, it's kind of cool.

211
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,520
And then I played someone's user recreated levels, the first person shooter Resident

212
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,580
Evil thing, and that was actually kind of cool, um, definitely different and a good

213
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,840
indicator of what you can do with, um, Little Big Planet 2, and then there was also like

214
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,240
a top down RPG game that someone made, um, which I tried out, that was pretty cool.

215
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,120
So, um, lots of unique stuff and I like how they're kind of hinting at some of the things

216
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,680
that you can do in like the first few levels, like they have the ability where you can link

217
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,880
two different levels together or more than two levels together, so like for example say

218
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,560
you wanted to create, you know, like a Mario Brothers game, you can do that, you can create

219
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,760
all the different levels and then just link them all together.

220
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,080
And I'm sure it's only a matter of time before somebody does create Mario Brothers in Little

221
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
Big Planet.

222
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
It's probably already happened, actually.

223
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,280
Oh, I'm sure it already has.

224
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:38,240
But it's really cool, I mean, I really, I've been trying to play it for like the longest

225
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,880
time, but you know, trying to be able to play a game on my big TV, um, it's not really working

226
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
out for me.

227
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,120
Thankfully though, and this will also kind of help out with, if I have to ever stream

228
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,400
DJ Hero 3 or something, I have a new capture card for my laptop that I can just plug into

229
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,760
USB, so it allows me to play games and just hook straight up to my laptop and I can play

230
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,560
it off the screen, no lag, so, um, that'll give me an additional screen to play Little

231
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Big Planet on.

232
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,640
Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelandscreeter.com, there's some people that are asking about

233
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,640
your hacking habits, uh, BlackWolf says, now you never have to pay for another game, yay!

234
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,080
Which is a very tongue-in-cheek comment from BlackWolf because he's actually very anti-video

235
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
game piracy.

236
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,480
Uh, but, Loki, you do still buy games, you bought, what, like seven copies of Grand Theft

237
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,520
Auto IV on various systems or something?

238
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,840
And, uh, it's not like you don't pay for games.

239
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,200
Uh, so then, I guess this leads to the question from AkumaJP, Loki, what is the benefit of

240
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,840
custom firmware for the PS3?

241
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Lots of things.

242
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,360
One, um, you can play all the different homebrew stuff that they have on there.

243
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,280
You can add different features to your system.

244
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,200
It's just really early, so a lot of the stuff we don't know yet what you're gonna be able

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,840
to do with it, but, um, yes, there's definitely the backing up portion of it that you can

246
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,980
back up games and, you know, pirate stuff if you want to, um, will I do that?

247
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,320
Probably not, because I had the ability to jailbreak my PS3 for the longest time, I actually

248
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,560
had the tools to do it, but, I just didn't, there was no reason, like, I literally sat

249
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,600
there going, well, I could do this and pirate a bunch of games, but, there's no real games

250
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
I wanna play!

251
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,480
I mean, so, it's like, that's sad, I mean, if I really don't wanna, you know, if there's

252
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,120
nothing I really wanna play on there, then, I don't know, but.

253
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,480
As long as I've known you and as long as I've been doing this show with you, you've always

254
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,200
kind of been the type to me that just likes to do it because you can.

255
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,880
Like, you know, because somebody's like, you're not supposed to hack your PS3 to be able to

256
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,320
run this, and you're very much the type that's like, well, yes I can, you know, I'm gonna

257
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,240
do it anyway, and then it is.

258
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Pretty much, yeah.

259
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,080
So, alright, anyhow, is that it for your gaming week?

260
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:54,480
Oh, I wanted to ask you something about Little Big Planet 2, excuse me, Little Big Planet

261
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,320
2, what was, kind of, you mentioned there's some new features and so forth, what was one

262
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,800
of the first things that jumped at you that you noticed was different about the game from

263
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,640
Little Big Planet 1?

264
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:11,080
Um, I mean, the springboards, I guess, that was like the first thing that they show that's

265
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
different.

266
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,040
Um, I like, it did import my character and all my stuff that they had collected in the

267
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,480
first game, which is kind of cool.

268
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,240
Um, I don't know, there's not a lot right now that's different, it's just a few different

269
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,960
things, but I mean, I know that the game is gonna be really, because it's kind of, I'm

270
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,080
still going through the first few levels of the game where the tutorial levels, you know,

271
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,640
so they haven't really introduced a ton of stuff yet, it's just very much like the first

272
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,680
game right now, um, but that's alright, because the first game was awesome.

273
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,160
Um, I did, I do like how they had some voice acting in the game, like the cut scenes, the

274
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,840
cut scenes are actually, um, very unique, um, and then also I like how, and I'm not

275
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,820
sure if the Da Vinci character or whatever is voiced by John Cleese, but it sounds like

276
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,160
it, and then later on, because they only have voice acting through the cut scenes, through

277
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,640
the rest of the game, he's just kind of mumbling, it sounds like John Cleese mumbling, which

278
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
is kind of funny.

279
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,160
I thought they had gotten his talent to voice something, I don't know if it was that, but

280
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,200
maybe a different, no it was Fable 3 I'm thinking of.

281
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Yeah, he was the butler.

282
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,720
I don't know, he very well could be in the Little Big Planet as well, I didn't follow

283
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
it that closely.

284
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,240
Sadly, I did not get to play Little Big Planet 2 this week, because I'm trying to save money

285
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,520
right now, so I can't justify a lot of new $60 games, and so for that reason, I don't

286
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,600
have a lot of new games to report on this week sadly, haven't played anything really

287
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,800
brand brand new, except I will mention this, because it's kind of different, and along

288
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,440
with all the like, I guess, doing things you're not supposed to do with your system stuff

289
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,120
that Loki's been talking about, I got an app that got pulled from the app store about like

290
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,120
12 hours after it was up, so I'm kind of happy I got this app.

291
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,000
It's called iDOS, and it's for the phones, and it's basically a DOS emulator for the

292
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
iPhone.

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Awesome.

294
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,600
So, what you can do is that there's various like DOS games that were actually kind of

295
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,040
included in the little store that come with it, like Duke Nukem, the original side scroller

296
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:16,960
is in it, and Wolfenstein 3D, the shareware episode is available there, and so on.

297
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,200
And let's see, I can actually fire up, I'm gonna fire up Wolfenstein 3D here real quick

298
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
on the phone, so you can kind of see this.

299
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,940
The only thing that kind of sucks about it, which actually is a really big drawback, is

300
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:31,240
that, again, the iPhone makes for a shitty controller, a very shitty controller, especially

301
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,680
when there's like eight different buttons on here to be able to play this, which is

302
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,300
next to impossible.

303
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:44,200
So you can kind of like, I don't know if you can hear like the old school ad-lib sound

304
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,560
effects there in the mic, but yeah, perhaps, but it's kind of cool.

305
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,760
But just playing it is a pain in the ass, like it just, it doesn't play very well, so.

306
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,760
It's just cool for a minute to say, hehe, DOS games I remember from when I was 12, but

307
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,520
until they get more tangible controls for this thing, it's just gonna be a little ridiculous,

308
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
I think.

309
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,400
Plus, I kind of like the fact that I got this app when I wasn't supposed to have it, woohoo!

310
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,080
So that's really the only, like, woohoo!

311
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,520
The only one I wanted to get, actually, that got pulled immediately was Minecrafted, which

312
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,960
was the Minecraft client for- Really?

313
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,160
I didn't even know they had that, okay.

314
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,440
Yeah, it was very brief.

315
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,920
It's supposed to be coming back later, but it was like a leaked version of it.

316
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,880
Funny, though, you mentioned Duke Nukem and stuff like that.

317
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,320
Well, Duke Nukem was on the store, I think, already, and then Wolfenstein is actually

318
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,440
available through, well, through Cydia, if you have a jailbroken device.

319
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Which I don't.

320
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,880
I don't know, I'm like- And yes, it still controls like crap.

321
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,000
I know hella people jailbreak their iPhone and they even came out on the courts and said

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,360
that you can or whatever, but I just, I don't know, I'm all paranoid about that stuff, because

323
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,840
this thing is like my life, my texting, my phone, I can't have it go wrong.

324
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,360
Well, but you're already on 4- It's not worth it to relive Wolfenstein 3D

325
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
all over again, you know what I mean?

326
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
No, it's not.

327
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,440
So that's kind of my perspective on it, so.

328
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,080
Alright, so that was really it for my gaming week, otherwise just more of the same stuff,

329
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,880
you know, WoW, Pac-Man, the new Championship Edition deluxe, and so forth.

330
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,320
So, that's it for my week.

331
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,080
Some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's news.

332
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,840
You can, of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and we're also available

333
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,040
on Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and of course we do tape live at All

334
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,080
Games Radio, allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right

335
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,040
after the Bobby Black Wolf show, if you ever do want to come in and join a live episode.

336
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,840
Please do join us sometime, we'd like to reach you.

337
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,200
Maybe you can sync your PS, or your iPhone with a PS3, they were saying use it as a router

338
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
for a controller.

339
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, you don't even have to really necessarily do that, some actual homebrew programs through

340
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
like Cydia and stuff like that, it allows you to sync a Wii remote to your iPod or iPad

341
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
to play Nintendo or Super Nintendo games.

342
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,640
It's just not worth it.

343
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,360
It's pretty awesome, though.

344
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,920
Too much, too much work for not enough payoff.

345
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,800
Alright, let's move on to tonight's news, we will start off with, of course, the one

346
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,680
and only Loki tonight.

347
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,760
Yes.

348
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,320
So it's kind of sad, they were trying to find a buyer for bizarre entertainment, or bizarre

349
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:30,880
creations or whatever, and unfortunately Activision was unable to do so, that's, dude, they put

350
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:38,760
out some pretty awesome racing games and hell, they had a pretty awesome arcade shooter game.

351
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:45,040
I can't believe no one wanted to buy the developer of the original Project Gotham games and Geometry

352
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,320
Wars, which was huge.

353
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Microsoft?

354
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Hello?

355
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
I'm shocked.

356
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Shocked.

357
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,640
But anyways, but I mean, this is kind of a trend if you think about it, I mean, look

358
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,760
at Harmonix, they're all, oh, nope, no buyers for Harmonix either, I mean, other than themselves.

359
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,680
I don't know, maybe just people aren't snapping up developers anymore, but I mean, I guess

360
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:15,320
Blur didn't do as well as they had hoped, and, god, I can't remember their stupid running

361
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,880
gun shooter that they had.

362
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,960
Wasn't there a James Bond game that had come out recently?

363
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:26,160
Oh yeah, yeah, the last James Bond game, but, I mean, come on though, what do you expect,

364
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,740
and this is Activision's fault, I'm sorry, this is plainly their fault, what do you expect

365
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:36,080
when you release a okay first person shooter the week before Black Ops?

366
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,360
I mean, seriously, you expect it to do well?

367
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,120
No, they expected it to die!

368
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,600
So I don't know, it could have done a lot better if it was released in a different part

369
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,320
of the year or next year or whatever, and it really was, oh, well, we have the license

370
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,760
to the Bond series, ah crap, they're not making another movie, well, we need to make some

371
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,580
money off of this license we paid for, so let's make a game.

372
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,280
And ironically now they are making another Bond movie, didn't they announce that a couple

373
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
weeks ago?

374
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
And they're just making another game?

375
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
Huh.

376
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Interesting.

377
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
That's not bizarre.

378
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,360
That's such a bummer, I mean, I had heard somewhere, I don't remember, it was earlier

379
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,080
in the week, so forgive me if my memory is a little rusty, but there's some type of new

380
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,600
tax in, I don't know if it's Britain, the greater part of Britain, or if it's just this

381
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,520
area that the Bizarre Creations studio is in that has something to do with video games

382
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,960
that actually may have had an impact that maybe was too expensive to keep these guys

383
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,440
up and running where they're at now.

384
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,560
It's one of those, you know, it's cheaper to get folks in another country to do the

385
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,680
development or whatever.

386
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,200
Yeah, well they're basically recommending that they close them now, is the recommendation

387
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
I guess.

388
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,960
And I guess they recently did the same thing with Budcat in the US.

389
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,460
Well I'm hoping that, you know, it's one of those for every door that closes and other

390
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,000
opens type of scenarios where at least these guys might get, you know, on their feet somewhere

391
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,040
else, or maybe they'll do that thing where they start up their own darn studio, which

392
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
we've seen a lot of developers in the past do.

393
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
You never know.

394
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Try some different ideas.

395
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,320
I can't believe that means there's never going to be another Geometry Wars game.

396
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Eh, whatever.

397
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Unless, well, I don't know, I really like that series.

398
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,120
I ain't really going to improve upon that, I mean.

399
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,080
Eh, I guess you could look at it that way, but, and I guess technically, what, Activision

400
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,440
would own that, so they could always have one of their other developing houses do it,

401
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,040
but I don't know, it just, it wouldn't be the same.

402
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Yeah.

403
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,440
So, well, that's too bad.

404
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,120
Chat dot orange lounge radio dot com for some comments.

405
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,000
Uh, Ezominar chat room says, this is probably a time where they would rather purchase intellectual

406
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,600
properties to re-release rather than take on new employees.

407
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,400
AlphaKananagram says, WTF, Geometry Wars 2 is the shit.

408
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,600
I agree, Geometry Wars 2 is awesome, and it's kind of a bummer.

409
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,240
But maybe since the Xbox Live Arcade especially, and, and I guess to some extent the PlayStation

410
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,080
Network, is pretty easy to develop for, I mean, I'm, I don't know, I'm not a video game

411
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,520
developer, but I am assuming that what, the, the folks that put out Super Meat Boy, not

412
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,600
exactly a large development studio, correct?

413
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,320
Wasn't it like three or four different people kind of buds getting together doing this game?

414
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Pretty much.

415
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,660
And granted, it's not on PlayStation Network, but it could have been, because I think they

416
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,200
have some dealio with Microsoft.

417
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,120
So my hope, maybe these guys that end up losing their stuff at Bazaar can kind of go and develop

418
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:28,680
maybe for these smaller platforms, like handhelds and Xbox Live Arcade, the Geometry Wars-esque

419
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,800
sort of games, or whatever other ideas they might have, because, you know, Blur was a

420
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,320
pretty good idea too.

421
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,400
That was a, I, I really think if there had been a Blur 2, it would have been awesome.

422
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,720
Blur 1, it was a good game, but it did need some work.

423
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,120
But I love that idea of the arcade racer meets Mario Kart, and the commercials for that were

424
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,100
always so awesome, where it was, um, the little Mario Kart cute characters that are practically

425
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,720
getting run over by the adult- Better yet, make it an arcade game.

426
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Perhaps.

427
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
Perhaps.

428
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,200
Uh, Derek H. in our chat room seems to agree with me.

429
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,920
I hope the people from Bazaar reform a new studio.

430
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,040
I hope so too, or at least a good portion of them.

431
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,360
I hear respawn's hiring.

432
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Never know what might happen.

433
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,880
Alright, moving on to some other news, and this has something to do with kind of like

434
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,920
basement development, if you will, on a very large scale.

435
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,360
StarCraft 2, of course, you know, has some very flexible development materials, we'll

436
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,560
say, in the game.

437
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,140
And people have been able to make all sorts of games within StarCraft 2, hell, there's

438
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,920
an endorsed by Blizzard shooter that's actually in the game, like a shoot-em-up type game

439
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
that's there.

440
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:43,660
Well, somebody has actually gone to such great lengths, they have created World of StarCraft,

441
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,320
and in looking at some of the screenshots in these movies that were subsequently pulled

442
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,240
from YouTube, I'll get to that in a minute, they really had kind of a look and feel, if

443
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,320
you will, of World of Warcraft, but with the StarCraft universe, where you could pick different

444
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,920
classes such as, say, Marine, or what have you, and the different factions in the game,

445
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,560
of course, being the three factions that are with StarCraft.

446
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,200
Well, there were some teasers that were up on the internet, and they got pulled pretty

447
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
quickly.

448
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,680
Blizzard put the smackdown on those and took them down.

449
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:17,600
And a lot of people were saying, boo, Blizzard, you guys are a bunch of bastards for taking

450
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,440
this stuff down, why would you do that?

451
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,440
And the modder who created this, Ryan Wenzel, you know, even kind of went on his own forums

452
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,320
saying, I don't really know what's going on right now, you guys, this is all kind of developing

453
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
at a fast pace.

454
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
Well, here's the deal.

455
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,560
Activision Blizzard is actually not trying to shut down this mod altogether, but I think

456
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,800
the problem that they're having is that it's the World of StarCraft name that they don't

457
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
like.

458
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,880
They don't want this guy making his mod called World of StarCraft.

459
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,560
So it looks like this MMO is actually going to continue on, but under a new name.

460
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,880
By the way, Ryan Wenzel, the modder, has actually been invited by Blizzard to go meet the StarCraft

461
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,560
2 development team.

462
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Interesting.

463
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,860
Also, this whole thing expanded so fast.

464
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,800
He was also invited by the folks that made the MMO League of Legends.

465
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,440
I don't know if you've seen that, but that's like Defense of the Ancients kind of, actually

466
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,480
that is a game I did get to see like 15 seconds of a little bit this weekend.

467
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,800
One of my friends is into that.

468
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,840
And it's like a Defense of the Ancients kind of like game, the old mod.

469
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,000
The people that make that invited this guy to go interview with him.

470
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,600
So his net celebrity went up like exponentially real quick.

471
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
That's cool.

472
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Yeah, it's kind of cool.

473
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,400
It was cool that he was invited by Blizzard though, because Blizzard was like, dude, dude,

474
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,440
dude, it's not the mod we're not cool with.

475
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
It's the name.

476
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,520
So hopefully they're going to be able to work this out.

477
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,980
And Blizzard wanted to make it clear.

478
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,360
It was never our intention to stop development on the mod, but with the name so closely resembling

479
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,920
that of World of Warcraft, we wanted to discuss the title of the mod with the developer.

480
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,880
And as part of our routine procedure, we contacted YouTube to request the video be removed while

481
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,320
that discussion took place.

482
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,000
Such a little like politically correct way of saying that.

483
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,600
So, interesting, huh?

484
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Yeah.

485
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,480
It's like, we're not trying to be jerks, but no.

486
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
It's all branding.

487
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,520
It's also, I think what's going on here, the unsaid part too, is it's a lot of that big

488
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,600
company syndrome where I'm sure the developers actually kind of had their eyebrows raised

489
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,800
going, that's kind of cool what this kid did.

490
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,440
Whereas the legal team and the protections of all this were like, hell no, shut it down.

491
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,120
You don't protect it, you lose it.

492
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Exactly.

493
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,000
So I think, whereas the development team was like, yeah, come on over and play with us

494
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
for a day.

495
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Let's see what you're up to.

496
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,840
The legal team was like, hell no, you need to shut it down under this name.

497
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,880
So it's kind of interesting how that all works together.

498
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,640
That sounds very corporate to me.

499
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,520
Well, you know what else is stupid?

500
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
What is stupid?

501
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
Nintendo.

502
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
What?

503
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
You don't say.

504
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,560
Well, basically, they were talking to Kotaku and said that they didn't see any reason to

505
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:03,480
put in some sort of trophy or achievement system because they don't want to tell people

506
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,840
how to play the games to get some kind of, quote, mythical reward.

507
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:15,520
The US exec Bill Trinen is quoted saying, basically, the way the games are designed

508
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,280
is they're designed for you to explore the game yourself and have a sense of discovery.

509
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,560
So it's like, we don't want to give you directions on what to do in the game.

510
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,640
We want you to find everything on your own.

511
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Which I understand that.

512
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,060
And they say that they're not really against the idea of trophies.

513
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,720
They just don't want it to be the whole purpose for playing the game.

514
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,680
They believe that except for Super Smash Bros. Brawl, in which case they don't care about

515
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
that.

516
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Well, that's what I said.

517
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,640
They are not against them.

518
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,080
It's just that they don't want that to be the full basis of the game.

519
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,960
I just don't think they want to license the rights to, you know how a lot of these people

520
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,520
copyright different things or have patents for trophy systems and stuff like that?

521
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
They probably just don't want to license that crap.

522
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,760
I have no idea and neither do I care.

523
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,680
It's just, they, I kind of think it's interesting that they went on the limb to say this.

524
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,560
Since everybody else is doing it.

525
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:16,160
Once Xbox started having it, Playstation had it, and they have them in MMOs and all kinds

526
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
of stuff.

527
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,160
Way to go Nintendo.

528
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,480
Way to not embrace something that's popular right now.

529
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,200
Online gameplay, meh, whatever, we don't need that.

530
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,160
Trophies, eh, we don't need that.

531
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,800
Organized community, eh, whatever.

532
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,360
I don't know.

533
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,200
Like I get this story and all, but it strikes me a little bit as a reason that's invented

534
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,920
after the fact.

535
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,040
Like that the Wii simply was not programmed to have this type of functionality in it.

536
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,640
And I sort of get that because the Wii doesn't have anything like Xbox Live, like Playstation

537
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Network.

538
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,880
There's no centralized Wii service except for, granted, Wii Connect 24, the thing that

539
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,480
lets you send the mails and all that stuff and the friend code play online.

540
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
But I don't know.

541
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,680
It just, I don't know enough about how computers talk to each other and how the internet actually

542
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,360
works, but it doesn't strike me as quite the centralized system that the other two are.

543
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,600
It could be patched in later if they really wanted to.

544
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,960
They did it with the PSP.

545
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,400
Or they're launching a new console.

546
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,000
You know, they could kind of roll it out with that if they wanted to.

547
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't know.

548
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,120
I just feel like there might be a little more value in Virtual Console, especially if they're

549
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,500
gonna try to get us to buy the same games again on the 3DS, to have some type of trophy

550
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,840
room for actually having played these games and getting scores on them.

551
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,840
I mean, even if it's just a frickin' high score table, fuck, I'd take Game Center over

552
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
nothing.

553
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
You know what I mean?

554
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,900
And Game Center, not that great.

555
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
But it's better than nothing.

556
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,640
I also personally don't care about achievements myself.

557
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,000
I just play the games to enjoy them and have fun.

558
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,280
I do, I get that, but it's sort of like, it's kind of nice to have that little pat on the

559
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
back.

560
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
To have that in your portfolio.

561
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,080
The only reason I've tried to get any achievements in World of Warcraft is for the experience.

562
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,040
Because, you know, I've got experience points for it.

563
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Yeah.

564
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
That's it.

565
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,320
You get experience points for doing quests and stuff, but you don't get-

566
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,400
I got them for getting the exploration ones.

567
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,680
Oh yeah, because you get experience points.

568
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
Yeah, I get it.

569
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Yeah.

570
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
But other than that, I don't care.

571
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,720
It really just, I, you know, I laughed at that one because I thought it was funny, but

572
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,640
other than that, it was like, okay, someone did something that they were gonna be doing

573
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
anyway.

574
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,000
But yeah, since you bring that up, Blizzard also doesn't really have a centralized server

575
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
for achievements.

576
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,480
Like, you can't, you know, this came up on a previous episode of Hoard House, you can't

577
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,200
link your Starcraft and your Warcraft achievements together right now.

578
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Maybe when Diablo comes out, there'll be like some type of Blizzard centralized thing.

579
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,320
But then again, that'll only ever be for Blizzard games.

580
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,120
It's never gonna connect to the Steam and all the Steam achievements.

581
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,920
I do, I get that it's starting to get a little fragmented.

582
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,120
It is a little silly that, you know, you have your set on the Wii and your set on the 360

583
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,240
and the Playstation 3, and it really should just be about beating the game start to finish.

584
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,040
But I don't know, I sorta like having that little, that little sticker in my book that

585
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,800
says, you did something really weird in this game, you know?

586
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,320
Rob, I know how we can fix that problem.

587
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,320
How?

588
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:13,320
We just take a page out of Activision's book, we send out patches.

589
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,000
Fuck yes!

590
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,120
Just like they did back in the Atari 2600 day, that would be amazing, like, that you

591
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,880
should get the actual patches for, and if you, you know, didn't read about this way

592
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,580
back in the day, back in the 80s when the Atari 2600 was big, you could take a picture

593
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,360
of your screen if you get a high score on a game, send it into Activision, and if it

594
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,760
was above a certain threshold that would be in the instruction manual, they would send

595
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,760
you a patch that you could like put on your leather jacket and, you know, hey, I'm cool.

596
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,360
And I'm pretty sure that's where the whole idea of achievements on a 360 came from in

597
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,720
the first place.

598
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,040
It's really a bummer, actually, that when they did Game Room, uh, you didn't have any

599
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,480
type of resurgence of this, you know what I mean?

600
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,840
I mean, I guess there were the little trophies in Game Room, but it wasn't quite the same,

601
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
you know?

602
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,880
Because patches are expensive, and if a publisher doesn't have to make unnecessary expenses

603
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,520
like that, they won't.

604
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,920
But if you print them in mass, it's not that bad.

605
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
It would be awesome, though.

606
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:14,420
I mean, come on, I've seen some of the tchotchke crap that they just push out for certain game

607
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:19,240
titles that are terrible, but, um, I don't know.

608
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
They could do it.

609
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,840
They're just being lazy.

610
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,240
Spagenator in our chatroom says, I wonder if they'll ever be a Diablo MMO.

611
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,960
It's kind of World of Warcraft, actually.

612
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,960
When I first played World of Warcraft, I was feeling a lot more Diablo than I was Warcraft,

613
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,360
because Warcraft is an RTS, and World of Warcraft really isn't, so it's interesting.

614
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,920
Derek H. says he had a patch for Barnstorming, and DefectiveCandy says my grandfather had

615
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
one of those patches.

616
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,680
So, some people remember those patches.

617
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,500
Well, see, that's the thing.

618
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,680
That's how awesome it was.

619
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,560
People are still talking about them today.

620
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,840
See, if they did that now, that would be awesome.

621
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,000
People would be talking about them for a long time.

622
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But no.

623
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Missed opportunity.

624
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,720
It's all about cash now.

625
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Unfortunate.

626
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,240
Alright, well, what else is in the news, Loki?

627
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Big stuff.

628
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
The 3DS.

629
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,560
They finally had the announcement of the release date for the 3DS and the price.

630
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,080
We knew it was going to be in March.

631
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,080
Now it's been pinpointed to March 27th.

632
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:25,540
The price is going to be $2.50 in the US, or I guess North America, and they're saying

633
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:31,400
that they're going to have quite a few launch games available for that and whatnot.

634
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,480
Not really certain on which games are going to make the launch, although two that have

635
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,600
been nailed down in the launch period by Nintendo, coming from Nintendo.

636
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:48,360
Unfortunately, are Pilotwings and Nintendogs plus cats.

637
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,120
I liked Pilotwings back on the Super Nintendo.

638
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:58,080
The Pilotwings game looked neat, Nintendogs and cats...

639
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,960
I know the game's going to suck.

640
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,600
I know, it's one of those things where it's like, it would be awesome to try, but I don't

641
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
want it.

642
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,960
Because I know I will get bored with it so quick.

643
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,040
It's just...

644
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,640
I know exactly what you mean, it's just like the original Nintendogs.

645
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,520
You read about it on paper and all the features they're putting in, you're like, oh man, this

646
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,400
sounds like it's going to be really cool.

647
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,480
And then I just know it, just like the first Nintendogs.

648
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,760
I buy the game and it's going to be dumb after 30 minutes.

649
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
You know what I mean?

650
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,240
You're like, God, I have to feed it every day, I have to play with it every day.

651
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,040
Nintendogs is kind of, at least the original one, is kind of an overblown Facebook game.

652
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,560
The original Nintendogs has a lot in common with a Facebook game.

653
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,600
I don't know, I can't explain it, but it's what it feels like to me.

654
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Yeah.

655
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,960
Some of the interesting things that they were talking about, which is kind of weird, is

656
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:56,080
the system actually has a pedometer built into it, and you get coins by walking around.

657
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,320
So you earn coins that you can spend in games for different things.

658
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,840
And then they have an activity log, which attracts your gameplay as well as your steps.

659
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,880
They're also talking about how you can make Mii's in the interface, and they have that

660
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,120
cool feature where you can take a picture of yourself and give you a bunch of different

661
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,560
options for Mii's and stuff.

662
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,780
You can import your Mii's from the Wii.

663
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,920
But you can't go the other way.

664
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Yeah, just because it's, well, because they say it's more complex for, you know, than

665
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
the Wii system.

666
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,560
The one on the 3DS is Mii 2.0.

667
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,120
Yeah, and it makes sense because if you think about it though, it all comes down to the

668
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,280
fact that they can't patch games, because they have all the Mii's and stuff in the backgrounds

669
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,160
on the games, but they can't display the ones that they don't have the features for, even

670
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:59,340
if they did an update for the editor or whatever on the Wii to make it more interactive and

671
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,800
stuff and add more features, but it would still not be compatible with those games,

672
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
I think.

673
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,800
What do you guys think about that price point, $250 for a 3DS?

674
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Do you think that's fair?

675
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,320
Do you think it's too much?

676
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,840
Because there's some people on the internet that say, you know what, that's too much.

677
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,960
I think it's fine.

678
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,920
I think it makes sense, because they're not going to really have any competition right

679
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
now.

680
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,540
And I guarantee that thing will be selling for a lot more than that.

681
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,640
You're not going to be able to find these things.

682
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:33,760
So you get your orders in while you can, and if you're savvy enough, buy two and sell one

683
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,380
on eBay.

684
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,380
I kind of agree.

685
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,600
I think the price point is actually better than what I was expecting.

686
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,160
I thought it was going to be 3DS, $300 was what I was originally thinking they were going

687
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,280
to do with it, but no, this is actually lower than I thought.

688
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,640
It's right at what I expected, based on what they put out the end retail price.

689
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
That makes sense.

690
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,480
And it kind of leaves them a little room to lower it later.

691
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,520
Like if they want to do a cut for Christmas, they probably will.

692
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,880
You know, they could cut it to $200 by Christmas with some type of package.

693
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
I don't think they will.

694
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,920
I don't think they need to.

695
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,640
I think it's going to be like the Wii, where it was in short supply for a very long time,

696
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,520
and they're not going to cut that thing for at least a year.

697
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,120
At least a year.

698
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
It prints money.

699
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,520
The price scale will come, and probably a new system revision will come out.

700
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,280
I guarantee you that that thing will not be dropping in price by the end of this year.

701
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,980
Every kid will want one too.

702
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,360
Every freaking kid.

703
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,240
It's 3D without glasses.

704
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,960
I mean, come on.

705
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,280
People are like, oh, it's so stupid, you know.

706
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,400
People are just going to be blown away by just seeing the actual screens.

707
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,180
They're just going to be blown away.

708
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,400
I don't even want to quote certain analysts, but there's people out there that have said

709
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,560
they could have charged more than that, and they could have still sold all the units that

710
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
they had.

711
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,040
So, I don't know.

712
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,520
I'm looking at some of the comments in our chat room.

713
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,400
Game Guru says, $250 is a bit too expensive for a handheld game system.

714
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,160
Tiger Claw says, when you put the 3DS with the PSP Go, from the price standing point,

715
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,060
the 3DS has the most features.

716
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,060
How much was the PSP Go?

717
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,520
Was the PSP Go $250 as well?

718
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,300
Yeah, but see, okay, there's a difference with the PSP Go and the 3DS, okay?

719
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:30,080
If the 3DS didn't have it, it'd be like the 3D, the DSi, and not even so the DSi, I guess.

720
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,000
The PSP Go had less features than the PSP, and they came out at a price point that was

721
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,880
more expensive than the current model, and you couldn't buy games for it in stores.

722
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,960
So it had people scratching their heads like, why do you want me to get this?

723
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,760
There's no enhancements to it other than onboard storage, which memory is so cheap nowadays

724
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,000
it doesn't matter.

725
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,800
There's no UMD drive, so I can't play any of the games I normally have right now.

726
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,200
There's no way for me to convert them into a digital format.

727
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:08,400
I have to rebuy my games if I want to buy the system.

728
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,900
There's some Bluetooth support, great.

729
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:20,520
But the thing is, and this is the best part, their retail partners or whatever, like GameStops

730
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,640
and stuff like that, or just mom and pop shops, they weren't bringing them in.

731
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,480
Well, GameStop might have, because they have better partnerships with these guys, but individual

732
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,360
mom and pop shops were not bringing them in, because what money are they going to make

733
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
off of it?

734
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,640
The system, they're making no money off of it, and they can't sell any software for it,

735
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,520
so they said, fuck them, we're not bringing this shit in.

736
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,000
And people are just like, if you want a PSP, get a PSP 3000.

737
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,320
I still say that today.

738
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
Get a PSP 3000 if you're looking at a PSP.

739
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,880
Don't you think you can get a Go anymore?

740
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,880
They slowly phase out.

741
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,800
So has the PSP went?

742
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,840
Let me get to a couple more 3DS stories here, and we'll kind of continue this discussion,

743
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,900
because there are some other interesting developments in the 3DS world.

744
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,400
Some of it has to do with online play.

745
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,440
First off, did you hear that the friend codes are getting reduced to one friend code?

746
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,640
So sadly friend codes aren't going away, but it's one friend code for everything.

747
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
So you won't have a separate friend code.

748
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,080
Well I still don't like the idea of a friend code, but I understand that they want that

749
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,320
in there so that the rapists can't rape our children through the internet or something

750
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
like that.

751
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,640
Hide your kids, hide your wife.

752
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:32,880
I don't, I still don't get why you can't just have a name instead of a 16 digit randomized

753
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
code.

754
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,520
I mean it's a step in the right direction, but when Nintendo is already three steps behind

755
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:44,280
you when it comes to online play, that news kind of just makes me go, whatever, it's a

756
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,840
good thing you figured the 3D thing out, because I don't know otherwise.

757
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,520
But that is, I guess whatever.

758
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,560
At least you only have the one friend code, despite the fact that it'll not really be

759
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
something customizable.

760
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,880
It is supposed to show you what your friends are playing though.

761
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
That sounds like a little better.

762
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,200
Yeah, and there's apparently an app in it that will show you what the status is of your

763
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,120
friends at any time.

764
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,780
So you can see what they're playing or what have you.

765
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:11,200
So a little more like you're familiar with Xbox Live, even though it's in an app, interesting.

766
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,080
Here's the other thing though that is kind of cool, and to be fair, I should say this

767
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,520
when it comes to friend codes.

768
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,380
If you are connected to another friend local, on the local wireless, you can push a button

769
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,040
to accept or send a friend request and you won't ever have to exchange the number.

770
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:30,120
The 3DS will just automatically grab the information and there you have it, your friends.

771
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,520
So that's, okay, now that's a little better.

772
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,720
I like that part of it.

773
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,840
So if you will, and you're at a convention, you can push a button and then get gang raped

774
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,840
by friend requests.

775
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:51,300
Yeah, but it has to be a mutual button pressing, meaning you both have to accept the request.

776
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,300
You know what I mean?

777
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,640
It's a big old friend request gang bang.

778
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,560
I know, the next Penny Arcade Expo or E3, man.

779
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,080
You know, the 3DS will be out by this year's E3, so it's going to be kind of interesting

780
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
to see how.

781
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:09,000
E3 is not so much a fan event as it is a trade slash journalism event, but still, there's

782
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,460
going to be, you know how many fanboys still manage to go to E3 because there are blogs

783
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
and so forth.

784
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:19,360
You know, there'll be plenty of that exchanging and stuff going on.

785
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,160
I wonder if they're going to have like a booth like they did back when the DS was new where

786
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,960
you could kind of do the download of the demos.

787
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,160
So I think that's a good idea.

788
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
That used to be cool.

789
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,760
That's how I played Meteos for the first time, which is still one of my favorite DS games

790
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
to this day.

791
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
Well, you know what my game was at that time?

792
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Electroplankton.

793
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Oh, yes.

794
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
I remember that.

795
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
Yeah.

796
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,760
I still remember one of the first E3s I went to.

797
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,760
No, it was probably the second one.

798
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,640
I remember when Shane took the Meteos demo with us, you know, because he just left his

799
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
standby.

800
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
Oh, that's all right.

801
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
Yeah.

802
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
We all did that one night.

803
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,840
We downloaded the Meteos from the 3D, not 3DS, from the DS station that they had on

804
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,960
the floor, and then we just didn't close, or we didn't turn off the DS.

805
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,040
We would just close the lid, and the battery had been fully charged that morning, so we

806
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,200
closed the lid, took it with us, and then at dinner that night, it was like, let's play

807
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
more Meteos.

808
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,480
You know, we still had the demo from the show that morning, so.

809
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,620
And I think, yeah, I don't know if it was Shane or somebody.

810
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:11,640
Some people didn't, like, they left their DS on and plugged in, like, after E3 was over

811
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,880
so they wouldn't lose the demo, and so they had, some people, I think, had it for, like,

812
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,160
up to a week after the show was over, just to still play it more.

813
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,360
It was a great puzzle game.

814
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,640
Anyhow, another quick story about the 3DS, and this has to do with the Virtual Console.

815
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,400
They did confirm, I mean, we kind of already knew this, but just a confirmation, Game Boy

816
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,560
and Game Boy Color games will be coming to the Virtual Console.

817
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,000
Super Mario Land is the first confirmed, which, by the way, blows, compared to other Mario

818
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
games.

819
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,400
It's like, it doesn't even play like other Mario games.

820
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,440
You don't have a fireball, you have this random ball that bounces off walls, and it's like

821
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,680
this Egyptian theme.

822
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,400
I don't think it was supposed to be Mario game at first, I think it was supposed to

823
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
be something else.

824
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
But whatever.

825
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,400
It's like Mr. Do.

826
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,840
No, well, okay, yeah, the weapon is, I mean, the gameplay is still like a Mario game, but

827
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
yeah.

828
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,680
So yeah, Super Mario Land is confirmed.

829
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,200
No word about advanced games, because keep in mind there's no longer an advanced slot

830
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,640
on these things, so no word yet if that's coming in the future or what.

831
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,640
So there you go.

832
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,800
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

833
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,520
Maybe something not about the 3DS?

834
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,800
Uh, actually, no.

835
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,520
This actually has to do with, well, it has something to do with Nintendo, but not specifically

836
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,240
Nintendo's side.

837
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,680
Yoshinori Ono, who is the producer of Street Fighter IV, said he wants to make Nintendo

838
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,400
vs. Capcom.

839
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:50,320
And he's quoted as saying that he wants to pitch it to Masahiro Sakurai, who is the creator

840
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,280
of Super Smash Bros.

841
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,600
So I think that that would actually be kind of cool, I mean, they're already doing Marvel

842
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:00,800
vs. Capcom 3, and then we have Tekken in Street Fighter, so who knows?

843
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,160
Would you like to have Jigglypuff farting on Blanca or something?

844
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
That would be really odd.

845
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
That would be odd.

846
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,160
I don't think they would ever do it.

847
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,160
No.

848
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,680
It would kind of be a dopey game, but in a, I don't know, like I said, there's a lot of

849
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,200
dopey games out there, I don't know, I don't necessarily mean that in a bad way.

850
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,120
If something's gonna work with Nintendo, it's gonna have to be like a, I think Namco would

851
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:30,440
do it, because all the Tekken games had weird characters like Gon and Yoda.

852
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,960
Why don't you just have Mega Man be a character in the next Smash Bros.?

853
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,960
I mean, weren't they kind of saying that a while ago anyway?

854
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,200
I remember when this last one that came out on the Wii was being teased with all the new

855
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,240
characters, because Snake was in it and Sonic was in it, there was rumors for the longest

856
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,840
time that Mega Man was also gonna be in it, because I guess there was another third-party

857
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:55,320
character that was in the game or whatever, which ended up being Sonic, I think, and they,

858
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,640
you know, people were saying, oh, it's Mega Man, it's gonna be Mega Man, because Capcom

859
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,880
and Nintendo have been talking about this for forever.

860
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,080
I think that'll be the most that you see come of this.

861
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:08,920
I just think in a full Marvel versus Capcom, or even Tatsunoko versus Capcom kind of way.

862
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,760
Unless they do all the cutesy characters.

863
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,160
Maybe all the cutesy Capcom characters could do it.

864
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Cutesy Capcom battle!

865
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,720
Tatsunoko versus Capcom would be awesome with a Mario character or something like that,

866
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,440
or I could see them doing maybe, like, Link or something in the Mar- like, they ported

867
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,160
Marvel versus Capcom 3 or something to the Wii or something, they could add Link in there

868
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,720
and just, like, Soul Calibur.

869
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,400
Yeah, that, that maybe, maybe, maybe.

870
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,640
Super chibi 3D Capcom fighter!

871
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,640
Eeee!

872
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,680
Well, that'll be the game that comes with it, and it's all the cute-

873
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,320
You know, Capcom did Pacato Fighter!

874
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,320
Uh-huh.

875
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,840
Yep, so it's been done.

876
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,000
It could- anything's possible, I suppose.

877
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So.

878
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,120
Ed Seton Beaver in our chatroom says, I mean, Capcom characters would fuck up the stupid

879
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,000
Nintendo characters.

880
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I don't know, though.

881
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,640
Couldn't Kirby just go- and, you know, just kind of have his way with the Capcom characters?

882
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,640
He does suck.

883
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:08,320
Alright, I don't know, let the fanboy wank begin after that story, but I don't think

884
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:12,720
anything will come of it except maybe in the next Super Smash Bros. game, which will probably

885
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,720
be on the 3DS.

886
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,720
Just saying.

887
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,480
Yeah, and never want to get a big ol' hard-on about it.

888
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,480
Mm-hmm.

889
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,280
Because, oh my god, you can play it on the Wii, friend code, across galaxies, and locally,

890
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,200
and oh my god.

891
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,240
And Miis.

892
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,240
Watch that.

893
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,440
There's gonna be a Super Smash Bros. fighter thingy on the stinkin' DS, and your Mii will

894
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,440
be a character.

895
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,440
That wasn't in the Wii version?

896
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,440
Eh, it might have been, I don't know.

897
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,440
It's been-

898
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,440
Maybe not, I don't know.

899
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,240
It's been years since I've played it at this point.

900
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,560
I don't remember.

901
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,440
I liked, like, even like the little adventure part of that game.

902
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,360
The adventure stuff was cool, I'll give you that.

903
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,160
That was a really cool part of the game.

904
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,160
So.

905
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,960
Alright, let's move on with some release dates.

906
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,120
Travel the world and see what's coming out to a console near you.

907
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,760
It's not a lot of stuff coming out this week, but there is a couple good things.

908
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,840
Dead Space 2 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, as well as the collector's

909
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:09,360
editions with the wonderful replica gun in there.

910
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:14,680
Paws and Claws Marine Rescue on Nintendo DS.

911
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:24,100
Two Worlds 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, as well as the royal edition of that.

912
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,320
And Lord of Arcana on PSP.

913
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,320
That I believe is it.

914
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,320
Alright.

915
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
I have to take a look here.

916
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,320
Yep, that is it.

917
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,480
Can we do things a little out of order and go to UK dates?

918
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,480
Oh no, nevermind.

919
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,480
I, I've, okay.

920
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,800
Sorry, my, well my, my thing wasn't loading, but it just popped up, so.

921
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,200
I blame your thing.

922
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,200
Yes.

923
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,200
Stupid thing.

924
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,800
Alright, well here we go, Japanese release dates.

925
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:53,280
The Xbox 360 will be getting Monster Hunter Frontier Online Season 10.0 Premium Package.

926
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,800
From what I understand, this game is pretty big over there, so it's like, I guess a repackaging

927
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,120
a new, new expansion or what have you.

928
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,800
Will be coming out on the 26th.

929
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,400
Otherwise, some other games that are coming out on the 360 very soon, Dream Club Zero

930
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,800
and Galgun are both coming out very soon on the 360 over in Japan.

931
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,200
But I hear Galgun actually has a demo for it out there if you do have a Japanese Xbox

932
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:22,720
360 account, which I do, though, huh, I did.

933
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,640
I don't, I'd have recovered that account.

934
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,240
Well good luck with that.

935
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,160
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Dragon Age Origins gets its Japanese release.

936
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,360
I mean, I know that's a long time after we had it, but they've probably localized quite

937
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,500
a bit for Japan.

938
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,600
So it took a little while.

939
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:41,360
Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Mindjack comes out, Shooting Studio and Wizardry Twin

940
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,360
Pack.

941
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,120
Like, is that like the old school C64 wizardry games?

942
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,200
Like a new version of it?

943
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,920
They're RPG games.

944
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,800
Dude, I think these might be like new versions of that old school game from the 80s.

945
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,880
Very, very text heavy in Japanese, though, so you better be fluent in Japanese if you're

946
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,880
gonna import that.

947
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,080
Did you see that Zork is on good old games now?

948
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:10,880
I had heard about that, but you know, I can't justify paying what they want for Zork.

949
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,880
You know what I mean?

950
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,360
Plus, I had the whole research.

951
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,700
You could play Zork on GameTap, like back when GameTap was cool, when Turner owned it.

952
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,520
You could play the Zork games, and you know, I kind of got my fill of retro back then.

953
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,620
And now I'm over it.

954
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:30,640
On the Nintendo Wii, huge week on the Wii, huge, gigantic, monumental week on the Wii.

955
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,580
The last story comes out this week.

956
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,000
That is a huge game.

957
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,640
I would be so excited if this game would come out in the US, they have said nothing about

958
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
it yet.

959
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,440
They have said they are not bringing it out.

960
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,440
Fuckers!

961
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,440
When did they say that?

962
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,740
They said that it was Europe, Nintendo Europe was commenting on it.

963
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,560
They said they are not bringing it out.

964
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,840
Change your fucking mind, because that game needs to come out.

965
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:56,080
I guess the wording is, they have no plans to bring it out yet.

966
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,760
Well, you need to change them plans or stop being so coy about whatever you have planned

967
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
for E3.

968
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,840
You know, what are they going to talk about on the Wii at E3 this year?

969
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,680
There's nothing to talk about.

970
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,160
At least this would be something to hold people over, because again, if you don't know what

971
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,440
this game is and why I'm so excited about it, it's a Mistwalker RPG on the Wii.

972
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,120
And the graphics actually look pretty phenomenal, you know, compared to the 360 and PS3, considering

973
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,120
the Wii's limitations.

974
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:26,220
Mistwalker, of course, the studio that made Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey.

975
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:30,300
And especially with Lost Odyssey, underrated RPG games available on the 360.

976
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,560
This is kind of like their foray into the Wii universe.

977
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,960
And it's coming out in Japan this week.

978
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,340
There's also a Wii bundle that's going to have this, but nothing about when it's coming

979
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:44,920
out over here, if ever, besides that Koi Lo comment that Loki already referenced.

980
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,340
Just to, like, kind of put this in perspective, when you look at, like, Japanese releases

981
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:53,060
for February, there are four games.

982
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,400
Actually three, because one of them is a collector's pack.

983
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,720
Three games coming out in February.

984
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,640
Here it is, right here.

985
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,640
Nintendo of France.

986
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,680
It says they have no plans to localize Last Story.

987
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,840
It says, let's see here, no plans at the moment.

988
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,760
Don't listen to the guy from France.

989
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:17,720
It says the adaptation of this game could be very long, 12,000 dialogue, or it says

990
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,040
it has 12,000 dialogues.

991
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,520
Listen up, Nintendo of France.

992
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,880
You need to surrender to the idea of having Last Story in English, not French.

993
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,120
And their translation teams are overstretched in the short term.

994
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:36,600
I'll tell you what's gonna happen, hackers will do this.

995
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,600
Hackers will...

996
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,600
Hackers gonna hack.

997
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,520
Hackers are gonna translate this.

998
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,400
And you know, it will happen, it'll get released, and that'll piss people off.

999
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,280
I think, I don't know, I don't trust some guy.

1000
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,160
If Reggie Fils-Aime had come out and said, it's not happening, then I'd believe it.

1001
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:00,040
Some random, you know, executive with Nintendo of France says it, we're all supposed to accept

1002
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,040
that as the final word.

1003
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,040
I don't think so.

1004
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,360
I say no.

1005
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:09,600
And then they followed it up with, I fought in your general direction.

1006
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,520
Stop.

1007
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,360
Moving on to the DS.

1008
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,360
Actually not a lot going on on the DS either, but this is a little more understandable

1009
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,980
of course, because we have 3DS on the horizon in February.

1010
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:25,900
But there are a couple puzzle games, and then a game called Sora no Otoshimono Forte Dreamy

1011
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,320
Season in regular and deluxe editions.

1012
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:34,420
It's an adventure game that's coming out with 3 chibi little cartoony babes on the cover.

1013
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,380
It looks like it might be some type of card game, but I do want to point out that this

1014
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,060
chick is not wearing pants in the screenshot.

1015
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,600
She's wearing gym uniform.

1016
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,380
Whatever, it looks like she's not wearing pants to me.

1017
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,280
She's not wearing pants, she's wearing shorts.

1018
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,280
Fine.

1019
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,280
They're bloomers.

1020
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,280
They're very short shorts.

1021
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,280
They're bloomers.

1022
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,800
Well, they have to be agile.

1023
00:52:53,800 --> 00:53:02,960
Lastly, on the PS3, I'm sorry, PSP, Toaru Majutsu no Kinsho Mokuroku comes out from

1024
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,960
ASCII this week, which that game, it's a futuristic world with magic powers.

1025
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,960
It's a fighting game.

1026
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,000
It's kind of like Dissada, but just with general characters.

1027
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,880
But this game might catch some people's attention.

1028
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,840
Valkyria Chronicles 3, Unrecorded Chronicles.

1029
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,080
That comes out with PSP this week, so I'm sure that'll have its fans and importers.

1030
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,800
Okay, now we can go to the UK Dark Sakura.

1031
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,800
Sorry.

1032
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,800
Okay.

1033
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,640
On the 25th, we have Dead Space, for the iPhone, sorry.

1034
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:36,800
On the 28th, though, we have Dead Space 2 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360, and Mario Sports Mix

1035
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,600
and Yogi Bear, the video game.

1036
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,160
Have you seen the alternate ending, quote unquote, on YouTube where Boo Boo shoots Yogi

1037
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,160
Bear?

1038
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,880
It's the alternate ending to the movie.

1039
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,880
It's great.

1040
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,360
That would mean you'd have to go see the movie, right?

1041
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,840
And I would hate to see that movie.

1042
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,960
No, you don't, you just look it up on YouTube.

1043
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:07,440
I understand that, but I don't want to even try to pretend to see that movie or part of

1044
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,520
the movie.

1045
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,680
You don't understand, it's awesome.

1046
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,640
Wait, hold on, here it is, here it is.

1047
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,680
Here it is.

1048
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:21,120
And it's all of the sad music and everything, and Yogi Bear sees the little wanted ad for

1049
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:28,720
himself or whatever up on the wall, and there's Boo Boo looking all sad and pointing the gun.

1050
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,720
Come on.

1051
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:36,720
All this sad music, God.

1052
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,720
By the way, I started it like a minute and a half into it.

1053
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,720
And then, there you go.

1054
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,720
Yay.

1055
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,320
Wait, seriously, who did that?

1056
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,320
I know, it looks, some people say it might be a viral thing for the movie, that they're

1057
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:55,360
saying it's independent, but it was actually like a viral thing, and then there's the bear

1058
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,360
skin rug.

1059
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,360
The very end.

1060
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,560
That's kind of wrong.

1061
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,520
Dark Sakura's rolling her eyes so far.

1062
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:09,560
See, now, if that movie, if that movie had that kind of humor, like it was like an adult

1063
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:16,640
movie, you know, with like violence and titties, how do you have titties in a Yogi Bear movie?

1064
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,040
Who cares?

1065
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:23,400
But if you had violence and titties in there, that might be a cool movie.

1066
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,600
I wouldn't see that.

1067
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,080
I don't remember titties being in the old cartoon.

1068
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,080
Exactly.

1069
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,080
It doesn't matter.

1070
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,080
Who cares?

1071
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,840
I don't remember the cartoon being raped across, oh wait, it was now, but I don't remember

1072
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,600
it being terrible like this.

1073
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,960
Of course the chat room is asking for a link.

1074
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,040
I'm trying to get one for you guys right now, but let's get back, do we finish UK dates?

1075
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,040
I'm sorry.

1076
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,040
Yes, that's it.

1077
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,040
Let's get back into some news, Loki.

1078
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:53,720
I just don't understand why we can't have violence and titties in Yogi Bear.

1079
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,600
It makes sense.

1080
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,600
Think about it.

1081
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:02,960
There was an Xbox 360 dashboard update this week, which pissed me off because that delayed

1082
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,360
me from playing my Grand Theft Auto game for a good half an hour, because our internet's

1083
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:12,040
really slow, and the first thing I was worrying about is, is console amusement going to get

1084
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:19,480
banned because it's flash and not hot swapped like the rest of them, because I got lazy.

1085
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,800
But no, that wasn't the case.

1086
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:31,420
It was actually a small update to restore, I guess, the planned launch or whatever, basically

1087
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,680
the option where you can have the disc and the drive, and when you start the system up,

1088
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,320
it'll actually play the game instead of going to the dashboard, and it was something I guess

1089
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,120
that broke in the last dashboard update.

1090
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,160
And they will have a second update later this week, because I guess they just didn't have

1091
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:57,560
time to finish the update, to darken, I guess, your gamertag pictures or whatever it's going

1092
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:03,440
to be, instead of it being on green or something, now it's on dark gray, which is stupid.

1093
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,440
Oh, and the other thing-

1094
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
What a change.

1095
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:11,840
Yeah, and the other thing is, it also broke the ability to play backups of Call of Duty

1096
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:18,160
Black Ops, Mario Warfare 2, and of course, Halo Reach.

1097
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,080
Also known as the real reason.

1098
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,280
Yes, the real reason.

1099
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:29,480
What it did was it added the, what was it, the API 2.5 checks, I think that's what they're

1100
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:37,000
calling them, it's a new, I guess, authenticity check that they've been adding to some new

1101
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:46,920
games to make sure they're not backed up, and if, for example, you're playing one of

1102
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,720
these games and it happens to be backed up, your console gets flagged for banning on the

1103
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,720
next-

1104
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,720
We ban you.

1105
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,720
The next go around.

1106
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:05,480
Finally, it doesn't always, well, they have the new light touch firmwares for the DVD

1107
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,920
drives already.

1108
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:14,680
This is back when the first dashboard updates came out, or actually the new checks and stuff

1109
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,960
came out, and they've already patched it out on these drives, assuming you have your drive

1110
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,920
up to date, modded and stuff, and there's some drives that actually don't support this

1111
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,140
at all, so it doesn't matter, you can patch it all you want, but they can still play backups

1112
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,720
all they want and there's no way for them to check.

1113
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,720
So that really sucks.

1114
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:36,760
Oh, and there's ways also to patch your games so that they're not checked by this too.

1115
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,720
But at least they'll get a good chunk of the people that are playing that.

1116
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:46,220
Me on the other hand, I'm safe for now because I'm not playing Black Ops or Modern Warfare

1117
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:51,880
2 or Halo Reach, and unfortunately I don't think they're gonna be checking episodes of

1118
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,880
Liberty City.

1119
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:58,000
Granted, I am playing on a legit copy of episodes from Liberty City, but my drive is flashed

1120
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
in one of my consoles.

1121
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Naughty, naughty.

1122
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It's for testing.

1123
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Of course.

1124
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,760
Because my J-Tag's broken!

1125
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,800
I have to test it on that right now.

1126
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,360
Alright, I'm looking at our chatroom for some comments, and of course everybody's lit up

1127
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,920
about the adult Yogi Bear movie, and Salacious Pop is practically writing the movie right

1128
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,680
now in some of the chatroom comments.

1129
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,920
Hey, uh, boo-boo!

1130
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,000
Don't boguard all the coke, boo-boo!

1131
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,480
Fuck you, Yogi!

1132
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,600
Hey, no bears allowed in the strip club, violent mauling.

1133
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,760
What did you do to my car?

1134
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,680
Yeah, you know that saying about bears only shitting in woods?

1135
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,680
It's wrong.

1136
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,680
Puts on aviator shades.

1137
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,680
Yeah.

1138
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:37,600
That would be awesome.

1139
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,680
Act deaf to her chatroom says, boo-boo has a right to bear arms.

1140
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,680
Get it?

1141
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,680
That's it, I'm, bye.

1142
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:58,680
Ladies and gentlemen, it took 398, 398 weeks, but this show has officially driven Dark Sakura

1143
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,720
to the brink of sanity.

1144
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,840
To madness.

1145
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,040
I had sanity, ever.

1146
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,040
That's true.

1147
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:10,520
Alright, uh, moving on, one other quick story for you guys, and then we're gonna get to

1148
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,300
the classic game of the week.

1149
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,280
Take it back to the old school way.

1150
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:18,840
Don't kick it back 14 years right now, remember when they originally announced Duke Nukem

1151
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,840
Forever?

1152
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:24,680
Oh boy, yes, that's right, Duke Nukem Forever was that game that was announced before some

1153
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,480
of you were probably born.

1154
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,920
This game was supposed to come out, and now it finally has a release date.

1155
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,760
That's right, it was published in the latest Game Informer magazine, May 3rd, 2011, or

1156
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,920
2011, whatever you want to say, is the new release date for Duke Nukem Forever.

1157
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,000
That is what Gearbox Software is aiming for.

1158
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,760
You know, of course, obviously they're really hyping up this release now, it's like the

1159
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:55,760
game that was never gonna happen, but honestly, guys, once this game kind of changed hands,

1160
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,080
it's happened pretty quickly, and I think it's not surprising that really all it took

1161
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:03,520
was getting it away from 3D Realms and giving it to someone else.

1162
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:07,080
Hopefully the game, I mean, I don't mean to disrespect 3D Realms, but damn, you never

1163
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,080
did anything.

1164
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,080
Did you see the trailer?

1165
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,920
Actually, I didn't see the full trailer.

1166
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,920
It's funny.

1167
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,200
Well, let me take a look here.

1168
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,200
It's just, when's your birthday?

1169
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,200
When's your birthday?

1170
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:20,160
All right, I'm gonna say I was born in 1931, because that's where my mouse clicked first.

1171
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,720
February 1st, 1931.

1172
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,720
Here we go.

1173
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,720
Fresh and white.

1174
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,720
Try mine.

1175
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,720
It whitens.

1176
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,200
Don't show me these goddamn ads.

1177
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,200
Just go to Kotaku.

1178
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,200
Seriously.

1179
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,200
All right, hold on.

1180
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,200
Joysick.

1181
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,560
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1182
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,600
It's gonna be done in a second anyway.

1183
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:41,840
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do, okay, here we go.

1184
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:48,640
A to M, of course.

1185
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,520
All these establishing shots of...

1186
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,520
They used to tell stories of a man who saved the world.

1187
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,520
A man whose very presence sent aliens running back to their mother ships.

1188
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,520
A man who disappeared without a trace.

1189
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,520
When the invaders came back, they came back angry.

1190
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:20,920
They tore our planet apart bit by bit, but they made one mistake.

1191
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,120
They shouldn't have gone after our women.

1192
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:28,560
Damn it, why do they always take the hot ones?

1193
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,600
You want it.

1194
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,600
Nice.

1195
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,200
The captions are the best part.

1196
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,960
You need it.

1197
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,520
Did he just punch that alien in the face?

1198
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,520
Yes.

1199
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,920
Awesome.

1200
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,320
And now.

1201
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,320
Rest in pieces.

1202
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,560
We're fucking bringing it.

1203
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,960
Nice.

1204
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,680
What?

1205
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:04,640
Did you think I was gone forever?

1206
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:10,280
Did they get the original voice actor?

1207
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,280
It sounds like it.

1208
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,280
Hell, I'd still hit it.

1209
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:25,680
It's this big giant alien with three doobs.

1210
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,200
He's peeing.

1211
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,800
That's lovely.

1212
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,480
That's nice.

1213
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,440
That's going on for way too long in this trailer.

1214
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,440
I'll be done soon.

1215
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,440
Really?

1216
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,440
Oh, how'd it go?

1217
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,440
Nice.

1218
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,440
I like the vehicle drive.

1219
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,440
I think it was cool.

1220
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:58,800
It should be good, because this guy just did it out of order land.

1221
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,800
Yeah.

1222
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,800
Coochie coochie.

1223
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,800
Hail to the king, baby.

1224
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,800
What about the game, Duke?

1225
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,800
Was it any good?

1226
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:10,800
Yeah, but after 12 fucking years, it should be.

1227
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,800
Nice.

1228
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,600
Very cute.

1229
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,200
With the minute I heard it was going to the guys that made Borderlands, I was like, okay,

1230
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,840
it's in capable hands.

1231
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:23,200
I'm curious to see how the game plays, like a first level walkthrough type of video or

1232
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,400
something, which I'm sure probably exists out there from the Penny Arcade Expo where

1233
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,720
they brought it.

1234
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:33,720
But yeah, it looks like it's keeping that same sense of humor, and definitely not holding

1235
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,280
back on the tits and ass.

1236
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,280
That's nice to see.

1237
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:43,880
I remember reading that everything that's blurred out or bleeped out is actually going

1238
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,880
to be in the game.

1239
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,880
Nice.

1240
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,880
Very nice.

1241
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,160
Let's see, our chat room is oversharing as they're watching this trailer here with us.

1242
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:57,040
Ed Seton Beaver in our chat room says, I am touching myself to the trailer.

1243
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:02,760
Defective Candy says, I have quite literally been waiting for this game my whole life.

1244
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:07,080
Bonds006 says, punching it in the face never gets old.

1245
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,080
That's right.

1246
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,960
Or is it punching ET?

1247
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:14,320
It's not Scott Pilgrim, it's Prodigy, okay?

1248
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,120
It's the Prodigy.

1249
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,120
Not Scott Pilgrim.

1250
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,440
Yes, it was in that trailer, but it's the Prodigy.

1251
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,600
There's also a cage match pick that won a couple times.

1252
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,600
That's right.

1253
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,760
All right, let's get into the classic game of the week.

1254
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,800
Enough about this stuff that you had to wait 14 years for.

1255
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,600
How about something that was out 14 years ago?

1256
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,600
I think it's 12 years.

1257
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,600
Whatever.

1258
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,600
He said 12 years.

1259
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,600
I'm going by Duke.

1260
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,600
Fine.

1261
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,600
It's like 13.

1262
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,600
It's like...

1263
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,600
Oh, shut up.

1264
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,560
All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.

1265
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:47,040
Fine, excite me with a classic game.

1266
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:50,160
The classic game of the week is Power Stone 2.

1267
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,320
Specifically Power Stone 2.

1268
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,920
That is a pretty fucking rad game, actually.

1269
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,920
Power Stone 1.

1270
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,320
Power Stone was great, but Power Stone 2 made all kinds of fun improvements over the first

1271
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,320
one.

1272
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,880
So first of all, it's got all of the characters from the first Power Stone, and it's basically

1273
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:09,060
a four-player fighting game, and it's just so much fun.

1274
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,700
You have all kinds of different gameplay.

1275
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:14,080
You've got the one-on-one, which is like the original.

1276
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,700
It's a two-character storyline game.

1277
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:21,280
You have arcade mode, which is a four-character storyline game, and two characters advance

1278
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,280
per round.

1279
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:26,440
Then you have original, which is multiplayer, so you can pick stages and everything.

1280
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,120
It's a fun party game.

1281
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,720
And then adventure that has an unpredictable storyline, and you can collect cards, items,

1282
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,440
and money.

1283
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:39,720
So yeah, it's got five different stages, and the boss stages, and all kinds of different

1284
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,720
fun stuff.

1285
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:46,680
You've got the desert stage that has the Pharaoh Walker, and all kinds of neat things, but

1286
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,680
all of the...

1287
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,880
It even had secret characters like Pride Falcon and Mel, and in the PSP version, you also

1288
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,680
get Kraken and Valgus back from the first game, so that was pretty cool.

1289
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,160
I like Jack.

1290
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,160
Yeah.

1291
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:06,600
I think Jack was cool, although I think for Dan, he was always using Foker, or as they

1292
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:13,120
had him in the U.S. one, Falcon, but you know, because Foker's like Roy Foker from lacrosse.

1293
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,720
That's what he always said, so.

1294
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,160
Or he's a real mother Foker.

1295
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,040
I would always use Ayame.

1296
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,520
That was me.

1297
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:27,160
But yeah, you can, you know, the stages will change, you know, as you do it.

1298
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:31,880
Like when you've got an airplane stage, the plane will start falling apart, and the characters

1299
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:37,520
will battle as they skydive, and floating platforms, and all kinds of different stuff,

1300
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,520
so there's sort of like little sub-levels in each level, and you can get different items

1301
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:47,840
like flamethrowers, and giant hammers, and bear traps, and a magazine, and you know,

1302
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:53,200
you get food, and invisibility, and wings, and all kinds of fun stuff.

1303
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:59,160
And you can, you know, drop bombs and icebergs at people, so, really cool, but you've got

1304
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:04,680
like the bad guys, like I said, Pharaoh Walker and Dr. Erode, Dr. Erode is cool, and he has

1305
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:11,320
a power stone of his own, but you know, you get the different stones and you can like

1306
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:15,640
do super powered up forms and that type of thing, it was pretty neat.

1307
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:23,200
And on the Dreamcast, now, this was in the adventure mode, you had like an item shop,

1308
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:28,560
and you could, you know, get different things, and actually the secret character Mel ran

1309
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,960
the item shop, and with the VMU, it had this thing called the mini book, that you can look

1310
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:39,040
at your player's item inventory, you can trade items with other players, and you can register

1311
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:44,120
things in your inventory as handy items that appear in original mode, so they give you

1312
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,800
this advantage.

1313
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:52,760
And if you put the CD, the disc in a CD player, then it plays the same message, well, it plays

1314
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:57,160
the same message that was used on the Dreamcast one, except there's piano music with it.

1315
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,720
And that's a power stone too.

1316
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,960
Awesome.

1317
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,840
Dreamcast!

1318
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,520
I played a lot of this on the Dreamcast actually, I actually had this game, this is one of the

1319
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,840
few games that you've mentioned from Sega that I actually played a lot of when I was

1320
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:10,840
a kid.

1321
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,840
Oh yeah.

1322
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,840
This is a fun game.

1323
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:13,840
I love this game.

1324
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,600
This is not really there, is it?

1325
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,600
No, it should be.

1326
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,080
They should do a new power stone.

1327
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,120
With this Dreamcast resurgence, that would be awesome, because I know this is a Capcom

1328
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,440
game, not Sega, but still.

1329
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,240
We need a new power stone.

1330
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,240
And how?

1331
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,240
With eight players.

1332
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,240
Absolutely.

1333
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Power Stone 2.

1334
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Good choice, Dark Soccer.

1335
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Very good choice.

1336
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,040
All right, we're gonna go to a break, guys, it's that time of the show where we take a

1337
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,040
break.

1338
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,180
We'll be back though, there's plenty more Orange Laundry to come, we haven't even talked

1339
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,760
about some of the things that were announced at the Square Enix event this week which we're

1340
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,760
gonna get into.

1341
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,080
A little more news about Duke Nukem Forever, believe it or not, a story about the Rock

1342
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,800
Band Network and some things going on with Apple.

1343
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,600
And we have to talk about what's going on with the PlayStation hack case, because there's

1344
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,600
more developments.

1345
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,920
We'll get into all that, plus a story involving boobs, and it's not even a Yogi Bear related

1346
01:09:58,920 --> 01:09:59,920
thing.

1347
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,920
We've got all that after the break.

1348
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:05,640
We'll be right back with your Twitter topics, emails, or lack thereof, and more in just

1349
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:13,560
a little bit here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1350
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:16,040
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1351
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:24,760
We are live on this Sunday, January 23rd of 2011 for the 398th episode of our little program.

1352
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,880
And we've got plenty more news coming up, some rapid-fire news in just a moment, but

1353
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,600
we quickly wanna give some plugs for some other shows that we work on.

1354
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,920
Every week, Dark Sakura has a show that she does.

1355
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,920
Yes.

1356
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:35,920
With her buddies.

1357
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:41,080
Comic Insanity, and you can find it on infamous.net, that's N-F-A-M-O-U-S, and we have a Twitter

1358
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,080
for Comic Insanity as well.

1359
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:47,280
And speaking of Dark Sakura, she was the special guest on a special live episode of the show

1360
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,420
that I do with Xtaphir.

1361
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:50,420
It's called Horde House.

1362
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:54,700
The best little Horde House in Azeroth, you can guess it's all about the World of Warcraft.

1363
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:55,700
Fun times.

1364
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:56,700
It was very fun.

1365
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,700
I had a good time.

1366
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:58,700
Good.

1367
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,700
Excellent.

1368
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,700
We had a good time doing it.

1369
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:01,700
So check those out.

1370
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,700
Both available on iTunes.

1371
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,840
Comic Insanity, that's the letter N, no I in front, and Horde House.

1372
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,400
You can find those both on iTunes or whatever podcasting directory it is that you use.

1373
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,760
Let's get into some rapid-fire news, and then the Twitter topics.

1374
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,280
You got just a couple minutes to lock those in.

1375
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,360
Twitter.com slash O-L-R for the Twitter topics.

1376
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,240
First, some quick news.

1377
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,240
Yes.

1378
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:27,200
There's a rumor that an official software development kit for Windows is coming before

1379
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:33,240
the Kinect, and they're saying it could actually be coming within the next few months, which,

1380
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:37,540
if you think about it, would time just perfectly with Game Developer Conference, and wouldn't

1381
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:41,560
that be something that they would probably want at Game Developer Conference?

1382
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,560
Maybe?

1383
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,560
A little bit?

1384
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,560
Good theory?

1385
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:52,480
It says, apparently, this is coming from a website WinRumors, sources are familiar with

1386
01:11:52,480 --> 01:12:00,080
the plans, and that a, I guess, official software development kit and Kinect drivers are being

1387
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:07,120
prepped for a beta release in the coming months, potentially arriving with the upcoming XNA

1388
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:12,640
update dubbed Community Technical Preview, and the report, I guess they're saying that

1389
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:18,980
there's statements being made by Microsoft's head Steve Ballmer earlier this month saying

1390
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:26,160
that the Kinect support would be coming to PC in a formal way in the right time.

1391
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,860
Makes sense that it would be at something like Game Developers Conference.

1392
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:33,960
My bet would be that's when it's coming out, you'll probably see an update to XNA and stuff

1393
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,000
like that around that time as well.

1394
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,360
You get support for, I mean it's good anyways, because you get support for the XNA stuff

1395
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,680
for PC stuff, and for the indie games.

1396
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:52,360
I'd really like to see what the indie games do with Kinect, it'd be very interesting.

1397
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,360
And scary at the same time.

1398
01:12:53,360 --> 01:13:00,160
Yes, it could be very scary as well, true.

1399
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:03,200
Pixel Force Halo is now free to download.

1400
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:08,920
This is the Halo demake by Eric Ruth, who you may remember ran into a little bit of

1401
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:15,480
trouble with his last demake of DJ Hero, but this time though it's kind of a side scroller

1402
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,480
shooter game, so go check it out.

1403
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:34,400
And you can find that on I guess bigdownload.com slash games slash pixel dash force dash halo slash pc slash pixel dash force dot halo dot dash free dash game.

1404
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,920
Or just do a damn Google search for it, because it's probably a lot easier than writing that

1405
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,840
all down.

1406
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:47,760
And then last but not least, speaking of DJ Hero, DJ Hero 2 has added some new trans anthems

1407
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:56,900
this week, and you can get these for $8 or 640 Microsoft points, and they are also available

1408
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:01,640
separately on the Wii for 300 points a pop.

1409
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:10,560
And with that you get Foreign Angel by Paul Van Dyke mixed with 9 PM Til I Come by ATB.

1410
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,960
Which even though that song I don't really consider like a trans anthem, I do remember

1411
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,880
that it was on a bunch.

1412
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,320
And apparently that song is remixed as well, my bad.

1413
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:25,720
It was on a bunch of trans albums back when I was buying CDs a long time ago.

1414
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:33,000
Not Over by Paul Oakenfold featuring Ryan Tedder, and Punk by Ferry Corson versus Imagine

1415
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,680
by Armin van Buren, so sounds cool.

1416
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,840
I didn't pick up the pack yet, I don't know, $8 is a lot for something I'll probably play

1417
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,040
once and then go heck cool, you know what I mean.

1418
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,520
Oh I'll pick up the pack eventually, I bet you will.

1419
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,760
Alright, moving on to some other quick news.

1420
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,680
An interesting other sequel announced to a game I kind of thought everybody hated but

1421
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,680
I guess not.

1422
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:00,840
99 Nights, remember this game, it was out on the Xbox 360, and there was even a sequel

1423
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:01,840
to it that came out.

1424
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,160
I played the original, it's not terrible, it's just not great either.

1425
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:10,580
So I never even bothered with the sequel, but apparently they've decided to justify

1426
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:15,320
a, get ready for this, MMO, 99 Nights Online.

1427
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:21,000
It's an action MMO, Q Entertainment has announced that they are doing this for the PC.

1428
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
There will be a number of RPG elements in this, meaning there will be different job

1429
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
classes, there will be PVP, you can party up with other players, and of course, hack

1430
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,300
hack slash slash and all the button mashing you are used to from the originals.

1431
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:39,240
It will be a free to play game, so that's pretty cool, microtransactions of course,

1432
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,480
that's how these things work these days.

1433
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:46,840
No word on when this game will announce in North America, if at all, obviously this is

1434
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,800
going to be in other countries first.

1435
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:55,280
There you go, Portal 2, big news on Portal 2 this week.

1436
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,560
Portal 2 has announced that when it comes to the PS3, it's going to have cross platform

1437
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,260
chat between the PS3 and the PC.

1438
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:07,380
That includes multiplayer as well, and get this, you buy the game on the PS3, you're

1439
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,140
going to get the Steam version for free.

1440
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:14,560
If you link your PSN and your Steam accounts, you will get the Steam Play version of Portal

1441
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,120
2 free, because you have the PS3 game.

1442
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:22,320
So, boy did they just sell many more copies of the Playstation 3 version of this game,

1443
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:27,260
at least versus the Xbox 360, which is really what Sony wanted at their conference I'm sure

1444
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:31,800
when they came out and announced this whole new friendship they now have with Valve.

1445
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:37,040
So they are also saying with this, a quote from Gabe Newell from Valve, quote, we hope

1446
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:42,240
to expand upon the foundation being laid in Portal 2 with more Steam features and functionality

1447
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:47,080
in DLC and future content releases.

1448
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:50,120
Could be very interesting for the future of these two companies working together.

1449
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,920
By the way, Cloud Based Storage will also be working on the PS3, which I think they

1450
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,080
had announced before, but it's kind of interesting to see how that's all going to work with the

1451
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,000
PC integration as well.

1452
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,840
One other quick story here, and I mean quick.

1453
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,160
You know there's a new Justin Bieber movie coming out?

1454
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,920
Yeah, I know right?

1455
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:14,680
Think of how I felt when I had to see that trailer before I went and saw Tangled.

1456
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:19,160
Well you know what, you got to give Nintendo props, because they wanted to use a 15 second

1457
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,960
clip of the Super Mario Brothers theme song in the new Justin Bieber movie, and Nintendo

1458
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,800
said no.

1459
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,800
Nintendo said no.

1460
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,800
Thank you, Poop.

1461
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,800
We'll decline your offer.

1462
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,800
Because cereal's more important.

1463
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,000
Yes, funny enough, I remember back in the day there was Nintendo underwear you could

1464
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
order from the magazine.

1465
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,120
And you think of how bad of an idea that was?

1466
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,120
This is much worse.

1467
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,120
Yeah, that's right.

1468
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,120
It's like Underoos.

1469
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:48,360
Oh yes, we may have made a failing cereal brand, and we may have hoarded out our brands

1470
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:56,160
to all sorts of different merchandise out there, but no, we are drawing the line here.

1471
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,640
Fuck off, Justin Bieber.

1472
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,760
There you go.

1473
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,520
They probably just didn't cough up enough money.

1474
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,120
I'm sure that's what these things usually go down to.

1475
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:09,800
You put the Zelda theme inside, you know, Scott Pilgrim, yeah, but that was a decent

1476
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:10,800
movie.

1477
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,440
And it didn't start Justin Bieber.

1478
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,440
Justine.

1479
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,800
It didn't start Cute Little Lesbian.

1480
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,360
Alright, let's move on with more stories, Dark Sakura.

1481
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:27,040
Well for fans of Bejeweled Blitz, it looks like Bejeweled Blitz Live is going to have

1482
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,480
16 player online play with the Xbox Live Arcade.

1483
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,280
So that's pretty cool.

1484
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,480
Lots of people can play.

1485
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,000
It's going to be crazy go nuts.

1486
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,400
And Dance Dance Revolution is having download content.

1487
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,000
Yay.

1488
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:49,720
There's a greatest hits pack that's got Paranoia, Brilliant to You, AM3P, Trip Machine, Put

1489
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,720
Your Faith in Me.

1490
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,560
And there's a premium pack that's free.

1491
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:58,480
This is Let's Get Away, Dreaming Can Make a Wish Come True, and Private Eye.

1492
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,400
And just a whole bunch of stuff.

1493
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,520
There's a lot of stuff on here.

1494
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,000
There's Economics Greatest Hits, which has Be For You, Hire, Burn on the Floor, Hysteria,

1495
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,800
Trip Machine.

1496
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,800
Really cool.

1497
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,520
I think that these are worthy packets.

1498
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,960
So hoorah.

1499
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:28,880
And also there is video out that has two more characters for Super Street Fighter IV.

1500
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,120
There is Evil Ryu and Oni Akuma.

1501
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,480
So that's pretty cool.

1502
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:36,480
Which I kind of saw coming anyway.

1503
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,480
Looking forward to that.

1504
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,480
Yeah there's video out.

1505
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,720
It hasn't been officially confirmed, but dude there's video so whatever.

1506
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,480
He's got red glowing eyes.

1507
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,480
It's Evil Ryu.

1508
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,480
Yeah.

1509
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,920
They have some better screenshots out there too.

1510
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,920
Yeah.

1511
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:49,920
Like that.

1512
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:50,920
Yeah.

1513
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,920
It's...

1514
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,920
Yeah.

1515
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:53,920
It's official.

1516
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:54,920
As official as it gets.

1517
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:00,480
And his moves are the same ones that he had in Alpha 2.

1518
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,480
And Alpha 3.

1519
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,480
So.

1520
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,480
Whatever.

1521
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,480
It's all...

1522
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,480
Let's see.

1523
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,720
This is what it's about.

1524
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,720
Arcade Unlocks.

1525
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,720
I love that shit.

1526
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,720
Yeah.

1527
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:13,080
I love that shit when it was around with DDR Max 2.

1528
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,040
They got people, got asses in the seats as they would say.

1529
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,040
You know.

1530
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,040
Got people to the arcade.

1531
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,040
Well.

1532
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,040
Fans of DDR.

1533
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:24,680
Because I'm sure people that play Street Fighter don't give a shit about DDR.

1534
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,920
But that's what they need to do.

1535
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,200
That's pretty, pretty badass.

1536
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,440
Are we ready to get to the tweets?

1537
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,360
It looks like actually they're just calling him Oni.

1538
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,880
I'll take that as a no.

1539
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,960
Which kind of makes sense because...

1540
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:39,960
Anyway.

1541
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:40,960
Okay.

1542
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,960
We have tweets.

1543
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,960
No I know.

1544
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,200
I remember when Oni mode in DDR was a big deal.

1545
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,600
And everybody was like, what does Oni mean?

1546
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,600
Oni means ogre.

1547
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,600
Oh, ogre.

1548
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,600
So.

1549
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,600
Alright.

1550
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,600
Now let's get to the tweets.

1551
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,600
Tweet tweet.

1552
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,400
Every week we invite you guys to show us your tweets at twitter.com slash olr and it'll

1553
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,240
invoke some discussion here on our lovely program and you guys sent quite a few tweets

1554
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,240
tonight.

1555
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,240
So we'll start it off with retertainment.

1556
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,960
Jumping ahead a little bit here but I'll go ahead since most people know about this already.

1557
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:12,320
Final Fantasy XIII-2, shouldn't they be putting their attention towards fixing the fuck up

1558
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,800
that is Final Fantasy XIV?

1559
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,320
Yes, but that's going to take some time.

1560
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:21,560
Seriously, Final Fantasy XIV relaunch in the US at least Christmas.

1561
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,560
If not later.

1562
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,080
Uh, I guess later.

1563
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,080
Really?

1564
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,080
It's a broken mess.

1565
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,600
Well, it is a hot mess but they could do an expansion pack and fix a lot.

1566
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,600
Hopefully.

1567
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:31,600
Like, you know, add an auction house.

1568
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,600
Among other things.

1569
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,600
If they expand it, it's more stuff to fix.

1570
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,600
It's true.

1571
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,100
Alright, let's see.

1572
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:43,520
Spazinator PSM, there are rumors that an MGS HD collection is in the works.

1573
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,960
A Metal Gear Solid HD collection.

1574
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,960
I wouldn't be surprised.

1575
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,960
It's a trend.

1576
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,960
I wouldn't either.

1577
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:50,680
We've got two already coming out in March.

1578
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,840
We've got the Tomb Raider and the Prince of Persia.

1579
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,360
Ah, good point.

1580
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,160
So, and they just had the Sly collection.

1581
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,640
It's popular nowadays.

1582
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:04,200
Moving on to another tweet from Spazinator, kind of keeping us up to date on the video

1583
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,200
releases.

1584
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:09,760
Pilots to Being Human, Perfect Couples, and Fairly Legal are free on Xbox Live, while

1585
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,960
Perfect Couples and Fairly Legal are free on PlayStation Network.

1586
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,240
If you'd like to sample new TV shows or whatever.

1587
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,240
I know.

1588
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,240
I have no interest in this.

1589
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,360
No, I have a problem with Being Human.

1590
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,360
What is, I don't even know.

1591
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:21,360
What is that show?

1592
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,360
Okay, it was a show.

1593
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:25,680
I've watched the first two seasons of it on BBC America.

1594
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:29,160
It's a show about, no it's not a comedy.

1595
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,160
No, a copy show.

1596
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:34,360
Yeah, it's about a vampire, a ghost, and a werewolf that live in the same flat.

1597
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,040
Sounds like the beginning of a joke.

1598
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:40,000
I've said the same thing, but it's actually a really good show, at least the British one

1599
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
is.

1600
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,740
I've heard the American one is not so good.

1601
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:46,680
You know, but sometimes they bring shows over from Britain and they're not so bad.

1602
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,880
Like All in the Family, which is like, you know, a huge American show from the 70s, that

1603
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,280
was a British show to begin with.

1604
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,600
Sometimes, and The Office has been on for years and years.

1605
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,220
I still prefer the British one, but you know, it just depends.

1606
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:02,320
Usually they'll start the same and then kind of branch off in different directions, but

1607
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,320
I don't know.

1608
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,880
If there's this show, I don't know how far do I want to get into this.

1609
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,800
Have you heard about that Skins show?

1610
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,680
It's big in the UK, but they made it here on MTV.

1611
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:13,080
Like I have zero interest in that show.

1612
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,080
Zero.

1613
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,680
Actually, if there's a number less than zero, I have that amount of interest.

1614
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,680
Negative infinity?

1615
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:23,120
Negative infinity is my interest level for that, but I can't get away from it on my entertainment

1616
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,960
gossip websites, which pisses me off.

1617
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:33,280
Act Def sends us a tweet, hey, it's about the PSP2, a little rumor, 3G connectivity

1618
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,720
and a very fancy screen on the PSP2.

1619
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:40,120
If this tweet from Act Def is to be believed where he links us to a story on Kotaku, apparently

1620
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:47,040
it's a report from Nikkei that the portable in Japan will be on the NTT Docomo network

1621
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,840
via 3G.

1622
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:55,400
Could that mean like this is going to be like T-Mobile's answer to the iPhone or I don't

1623
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,320
know, I'm pulling that out of my ass, but one of the providers that doesn't have the

1624
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,520
iPhone, maybe they'll have the PSP2.

1625
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,520
Interesting.

1626
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:07,720
They're not saying anything about phone, just 3G connection, kind of like an iPad.

1627
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,720
That would be interesting because that means you could play multiplayer anywhere you go.

1628
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,520
What would you think about 3G on the PSP2?

1629
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,360
Would that be cool for you, Loki?

1630
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:16,920
Would you like that?

1631
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:22,680
Here's what it comes down to, and this is with any 3G gaming app, 3G means I need a

1632
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:28,240
fucking subscription for a data plan to somewhere, and that's the killer right there.

1633
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:35,480
I mean, unless it's included in the price of that system, it's going to be fucking expensive

1634
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:41,880
because you're going to have to pay another $100 a month or $60 a month to play your stupid

1635
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:42,880
system.

1636
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:51,880
Wi-Fi, no, no thanks, but then again, if I can do it via Wi-Fi, that's fine, I'll just

1637
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,840
tether it to my phone.

1638
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:59,120
Alright, uh, Sturlok sends us a tweet, Crimson Echoes finally leaked, suck it Square, and

1639
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,400
then links us to the story, and I was like, what's Crimson Echoes?

1640
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:08,440
Oh yes, it's the fan-made Chrono Trigger sequel, so the fan-made Chrono Trigger sequel finally

1641
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,480
leaked out to the internet, which we all knew it would, this is the one Square Enix shut

1642
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:15,400
down not that long ago, we all knew it, once it hits the internet it's out, and sure enough

1643
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:16,720
that's what happened.

1644
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:21,120
Crimson Echoes made its way out, apparently also a game called Flames of Eternity got

1645
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:25,680
leaked, which was I guess a branch-off of the same title, so there you go.

1646
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:28,560
By the way, I'm looking at the fighting in this game, it looks like Final Fantasy VI,

1647
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:32,480
it's kind of interesting, maybe it's like a really elaborate ROM hack or something,

1648
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,640
I don't know.

1649
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:41,360
Alright, uh, let's move on to, uh, Defective Candy, I like this, sent us a tweet, Connect

1650
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:45,680
hacked for surgical robot, what?

1651
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:50,320
A group of graduate students at the University of Washington have modified the firmware and

1652
01:25:50,320 --> 01:26:00,240
software of the Connect to guide the actions of surgical robots, wow, and it gets into

1653
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:04,560
more of the details of this, I'm looking for some quotes here, I'm just seeing this story

1654
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,080
for the first time.

1655
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,800
The hacked unit adds the sense of touch and feeds information to the surgeon, the setup

1656
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:16,320
could save $50,000 on the standard rig used to perform non-invasive surgery.

1657
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:21,520
We could define basically a force field around, say, a liver, if the surgeon got too close

1658
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,760
he would run into that force field and it would protect the object he didn't want to

1659
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:27,480
cut, that's weird.

1660
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:33,160
But then, what about the day the machines take over, do you really want a machine operating

1661
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:34,160
on you?

1662
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,160
Cyberdyne!

1663
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:43,800
Exactly, Skynet, alright, a couple tweets from Tigerclaw, Telltale Games strongly hints

1664
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:49,080
at doing the Walking Dead game, I guess really the title says it all but we're linked to

1665
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:54,360
a story there, The Walking Dead is a show on AMC, and it was a comic book series that

1666
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:58,120
now is this big TV show, I know a few people that are into this, I haven't watched this,

1667
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:02,880
but apparently Telltale Games is hinting that perhaps they're doing something on this, and

1668
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,400
that was, well Telltale's got a big event going on, they're going to be talking about

1669
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:12,680
five new multi-platform efforts, and I'm assuming Jurassic Park of course is one of those, they're

1670
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:17,740
also saying one of the titles announced is based on a just launched property from the

1671
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:23,120
TV and comic book world whose popularity is changing life as some know it, so some people

1672
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:28,040
are inferring that from that, sounds like we'll find out in a month, could be interesting.

1673
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:31,800
And then Zeba sends us a couple tweets as well, the Kinect hacker that made himself

1674
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,560
into a bunch of Minecraft monuments has now put those monuments in motion, weren't you

1675
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:39,000
saying something about this, it was during the break or right at the end of part A, I

1676
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
don't remember?

1677
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,760
I was just saying that, we were talking about this like a couple weeks ago, oh was it?

1678
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:50,920
Well there you go, apparently this is a Minecraft monument where now it moves, I still have

1679
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:54,880
never played Minecraft, does that make me a bad gamer, or just lazy, nope, I haven't

1680
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,940
done it either, weird, yeah apparently the Minecraft monument moves at 30 frames a second

1681
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:04,400
while he juggles three balls, which I guess if you had to kind of create this like bit

1682
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,880
by bit, it's probably a pain in the ass, you know what's better though?

1683
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:11,400
But it's the one that they have where it's a cat chasing a laser.

1684
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:16,200
Mnzeba also sent us a tweet about this, a letter from the Final Fantasy XIV producer

1685
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:21,200
explaining upcoming huge changes, and it's a very long read, and this was just produced

1686
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:26,960
a little bit this week, they actually did some polls, this is really long, so I might

1687
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,280
have to read this while someone else is doing a story, but yeah, looks like they really

1688
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:36,080
took this poll and kind of like took some of the feedback to heart, so what are they

1689
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,200
talking about?

1690
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:42,800
Tutorials for new players, quests revolving around the danger facing the world, public

1691
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:50,800
company quests, improvements to the log, improvements of dialogue, windows, character jump feature,

1692
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:57,520
interesting, guildlevs, so yeah, they want to do a whole bunch of new shit in the game,

1693
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:03,200
we'll just leave it at that, there's a long letter available, lodestone.finalfantasyxiv,

1694
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:07,360
the roman wayofsaying14.com, that's where you can find that.

1695
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,680
Last couple tweets here, another one from Tiger Claw saying consumer group reporting

1696
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:16,560
Activision to UK Fair Trade Office over black ops glitches, and this is a link to a story

1697
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:22,200
on Gamasutra, it's a British consumer group, The Gamer's Voice, they're going to complain

1698
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:27,200
to the UK Office of Fair Trading about the performance issues in the PS3 and PC versions

1699
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:32,400
of Call of Duty Black Ops, I guess the publisher did not respond to an open letter from the

1700
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:37,280
group one month ago, which talked about the freezing and online multiplayer login that

1701
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,640
the game is not functioning as attended or advertised.

1702
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:46,800
So I guess you could say it's kind of like the Better Business Bureau in a way, interesting.

1703
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,480
So somebody's going to take him to task over that one, I don't know, these things usually

1704
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:54,640
don't end up in much, usually like either a settlement or a letter or something, I don't

1705
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:57,360
know, but it'll be interesting to see what happens overseas.

1706
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:02,800
One last tweet from Alex Carson, Alex P. Carson on Twitter, do you remember last year when

1707
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,360
I made a proposition of you mentioning me on the show in exchange for me raising your

1708
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,680
Facebook fan count?

1709
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,960
I gotta say no, but it was over a year ago.

1710
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,400
But I did just name you on the show, there you go.

1711
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,280
But I gotta be honest, and this is kind of in our philosophy on OLR in general, we don't

1712
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:25,560
just want people, we don't just need numbers, we want people that listen to the show and

1713
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,560
enjoy the show.

1714
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,240
So yeah, of course, you know, we always ask at the end of every show, tell your friends

1715
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:34,320
about the show, but you know, and again, I'm inferring a lot from this tweet, but of course

1716
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:39,480
don't spam, don't spam, we don't need to sink to that level, and you know, I think it would

1717
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:42,200
be awesome if your friends would join the Facebook page, but only if they really want

1718
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,200
to hear the show.

1719
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,920
If they're not into video games, you know, maybe this isn't the show for them.

1720
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:50,960
Maybe they need to subscribe to a sex podcast, woohoo, so.

1721
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:53,760
But we always appreciate any efforts, absolutely.

1722
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,800
And I'll even read your Twitter name on there, there you go.

1723
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:58,880
Alright!

1724
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:03,400
Let's move on to some more gaming news, some phone calls coming up in just a little bit,

1725
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,400
as well.

1726
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,400
Mmhmm.

1727
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:12,680
Um, so the court case against, um, Geohot has been delayed, and as we kind of alluded

1728
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:20,200
to last week when we were talking about it, um, we brought up how it's being held right

1729
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:27,460
now in San Francisco, but he's from New Jersey, and so, um, you know, there was a whole question

1730
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:29,640
over the jurisdiction and stuff like that.

1731
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,480
I remember talking about that last week, yeah.

1732
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:38,400
Because according, you know, to, uh, the judge, it says if having a PayPal account were enough,

1733
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:43,520
um, then there would be personal jurisdiction in this court over everybody, and that can't

1734
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,520
be right.

1735
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:49,920
And, um, so the case is pending further discussion over jurisdiction, a decision Sony is likely

1736
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:57,680
to frown upon, um, and, you know, now, seeing as how the hack is, you know, completely available

1737
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:06,600
online, and as I mentioned earlier, um, you know, installing it on your system is so stupid

1738
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:12,600
easy now, especially if you want to install custom firmware that people have made, which

1739
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:18,420
have gone a little bit beyond what Geohot, um, had wanted, and kind of, it could lead

1740
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:25,440
to piracy, um, I mean, it's, it's literally just flashing your console in the recovery

1741
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,440
mode.

1742
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,440
That's it.

1743
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:35,360
Um, yeah, I, I don't know, it's gonna be an interesting case.

1744
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:40,040
Yeah, story's gonna come up every damn week until they settle.

1745
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,040
Exactly.

1746
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,040
Well, and then-

1747
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,040
I don't think they'll settle either.

1748
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:47,320
And then you have companies using it, the whole PS3 hacking thing, as an excuse.

1749
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:53,280
According to Infinity Ward, um, I'm assuming this is what's left of Infinity Ward, um,

1750
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:59,680
Modern Warfare 2 has been, or has been kind of made unplayable, thanks to people hacking

1751
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:03,720
the game, and it says Infinity Ward cannot patch a fix.

1752
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:10,920
Um, people are saying it's a total shambles, it's unplayable, um, according to Infinity

1753
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:17,300
Ward's games rely on security of the encryption on the platforms they're played on, um, unless

1754
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:21,880
the security exploit itself is resolved on the platform, updates to the game through

1755
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:24,480
patches will not resolve the problem.

1756
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:28,800
At this time, we do not have any ability to restore or adjust individual stats.

1757
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:38,920
Uh, we're looking at every option to help us, um, help any user affected, and, um, here's

1758
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:40,280
what's funny about this whole thing.

1759
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:44,040
See, they put it out around the time when all these hacking stories, you know, with

1760
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:50,360
the whole keys and stuff being released, um, were put out, but, if you look at the big

1761
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:54,340
picture here, it's actually, this was happening before all that happened, and it's because

1762
01:33:54,340 --> 01:34:01,340
people have been hacking save files, and they've been doing that, um, so this is totally unrelated

1763
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:07,280
to anything that has to do with those PS3 keys, and on top of that, um, they're doing

1764
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:10,760
the same thing on the 360, they're hacking save files and stuff, and that stuff's been

1765
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:18,860
kinda been patched, um, so, really comes down to, they just don't wanna fix it, and if you

1766
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:20,400
think about it, why would they?

1767
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,960
Modern Warfare 2, eh, whatever, so it goes to shit.

1768
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,960
Buy Black Ops!

1769
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,960
So, I don't know.

1770
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:34,720
Interesting, I, uh, there's no way to just track down who's fucking up the game and just

1771
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,720
ban them?

1772
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:40,960
Um, they, maybe they could, but, you know, they could just create another account, I

1773
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:41,960
guess.

1774
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:44,120
They'd have to actually track down systems.

1775
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,120
Interesting.

1776
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:48,640
Sorry about that, you cut off there in the beginning.

1777
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,000
So wouldn't that go back to the laziness factor?

1778
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I think so.

1779
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
No.

1780
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Yep.

1781
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,960
And here's the thing, though, is people aren't actually reading into this, they're kinda

1782
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:02,920
saying, oh, well, thanks GeoHot for, you know, doing all this, now Modern Warfare 2 is unplayable.

1783
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:07,880
If you're gonna believe everybody and what they say, and without doing actual research

1784
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:13,840
into what's going on, then sure, go ahead and blame those hackers, but it is different.

1785
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:16,720
It's a special kind of hacker out there.

1786
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:20,980
It's the little kid that figures out, oh, hey, I can grief somebody this way, or I can

1787
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:25,200
cheat in this game, and, you know, screwed up for everybody.

1788
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:30,480
It's just like, you know, in the whole Grand Theft Auto, you know, hacking or modding community,

1789
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:34,000
there's people that actually wanna make stuff that's kinda cool, and then there's people

1790
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,200
that wanna make cars that freeze people, or guns that freeze people's games, because they're

1791
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:41,420
douchebags, and that's what they do.

1792
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:45,600
So no matter what you do, those douchebags will find a way to be a douche.

1793
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,880
Play with your friends and nobody else.

1794
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:48,880
Exactly.

1795
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,320
That's sadly where some of this is going, honestly, online.

1796
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,440
If you wanna play a legitimate game, you gotta play with your friends.

1797
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,000
Take your ball and go home.

1798
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Ha!

1799
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,800
All right, some news coming out of Square Enix this week, revolving in a tweet a little

1800
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,320
bit ago, kinda references.

1801
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:06,760
Final Fantasy XIII-2 was announced, and it's coming out for the 360 and the PlayStation

1802
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:07,760
3.

1803
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,100
It was during the little press event that Square Enix had this week.

1804
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:14,040
There's a little trailer that goes with it as well.

1805
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,060
We won't play that one like we did the other one, though.

1806
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:19,760
But we will say that in the little logo, you can see that there's this whole little like

1807
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:24,720
contrast character to lightning, so that there's kinda like, I don't know, an anti-lightning

1808
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,000
or what it is.

1809
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,600
Now they are saying that Final Fantasy XIII-2 is set to launch in Japan in 2011, but that's

1810
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,920
probably just Japan.

1811
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,760
They're not saying anything about the US just yet.

1812
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,480
Oh no, they said next winter.

1813
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:38,480
I'm sorry about that.

1814
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,920
They said next winter was the release.

1815
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:44,280
Does that mean next February or next December?

1816
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,840
Because you could kinda take that a couple ways.

1817
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,360
Hopefully it's a quick cycle.

1818
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,760
I mean, I'm assuming this is just gonna be done in the same engine as the first game

1819
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:56,800
was, but just, you know, new story, some new models and all that stuff.

1820
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,600
Hopefully more dreshsphere, right?

1821
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,600
Yay.

1822
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,060
Okay, maybe not.

1823
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:06,280
The name of Final Fantasy Agito XIII has been changed.

1824
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:10,520
It's now Final Fantasy Type Zero, which would explain some of the stories in the past couple

1825
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:13,080
weeks about these trademarks showing up.

1826
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:17,560
Final Fantasy Type Zero is the game that is coming out instead.

1827
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:22,400
It is gonna be on the PSP, of course, and they just said that this title just seems

1828
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:27,520
to be more appropriate because this is a more action-oriented design of the game.

1829
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,520
And there you go.

1830
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,520
It's gonna be coming out to the PSP.

1831
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:34,380
30 voiced characters in the game, multiplayer supposedly in it as well.

1832
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:37,960
Nothing announced just yet for what's going on in North America, but it is coming out

1833
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:42,000
to Japan this summer on two UMDs.

1834
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Not one, but two.

1835
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,720
That must be a big game.

1836
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:48,280
We'll see.

1837
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:53,360
Well, how about going back to something that we touched on earlier?

1838
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,360
Yay!

1839
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,960
It's like a blast from the past.

1840
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:56,960
Yes.

1841
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,360
Duke Nukem Forever!

1842
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,360
Yay.

1843
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,000
Is there gonna be download content?

1844
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Is there?

1845
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Huh, huh, huh, huh?

1846
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Um, probably.

1847
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,720
Well, they haven't announced anything about it, but they are saying that they are trying

1848
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:15,280
to, and this is a quote, on making possible the UNpossible shipping Duke Nukem Forever.

1849
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:20,800
Um, but they are saying that there could be some download content, that they are keeping

1850
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,160
the future in mind.

1851
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,920
So I'm sure there will be.

1852
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,760
Build your own strip club DLC.

1853
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,760
Yay!

1854
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,400
I want voice macros to come back.

1855
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,720
That'll be nice.

1856
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,480
I wouldn't be surprised if they have DLC.

1857
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:37,560
I mean, look at the awesome DLC they had for the original Duke Nukem 3D.

1858
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:41,480
They have the fourth episode, the Atomic Edition, which is just awesome.

1859
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,720
I love the supermarket level.

1860
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:47,520
I love the level that was kind of Disneyland, but not, you know, the Pirates of the Caribbean

1861
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,400
ride and stuff.

1862
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,400
Awesome.

1863
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,880
I just miss Duke Nukem Deathmatch.

1864
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,800
That was awesome.

1865
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,400
I hope this game is as awesome as the old Duke Nukem was.

1866
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,400
I really do.

1867
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,400
It looks pretty neat.

1868
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:01,400
It does.

1869
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,400
It does.

1870
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:07,360
The trailer's sense of humor is any indication, but, you know, how often do games look cool

1871
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,520
and they suck?

1872
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,960
Just as a reference as the original.

1873
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:11,960
Yes.

1874
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:18,800
There are some developers out there developing for the iOS platform that are pissed off at

1875
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:27,320
Apple because they just don't take piracy or theft seriously.

1876
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:31,280
Theft in this case happens to be a game called The Blocks Cometh.

1877
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:35,920
It's an iPhone game that's out there right now that's completely ripped off of a Flash

1878
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:36,920
game.

1879
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:38,080
It didn't just copy the game.

1880
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:41,720
They took the name, they took the assets, the music, everything.

1881
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,920
They ported it over.

1882
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,600
Unfortunately, it's not by the creators.

1883
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:49,120
It's by somebody else.

1884
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:53,200
The creators of the actual game actually have a version for the iPhone that's in the works

1885
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,520
right now, but they're pissed off.

1886
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:01,920
They contacted Apple and their customer service or whomever has said their legal department

1887
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:09,320
has contacted the people responsible for it and they've kind of given them the runaround,

1888
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:15,160
but there's nothing really that they seem to be doing.

1889
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:19,880
It's kind of a serious case if you think about it because it's not just, oh, this game is

1890
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:24,320
sort of like Angry Birds or this game is sort of like something else.

1891
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:29,120
This is literally, we took this game, stole everything from it, and threw it on there.

1892
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:36,400
If I created Super Mario Brothers and popped it onto the iOS, Apple's app store and stuff

1893
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,400
like that.

1894
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,400
Well, could you?

1895
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:42,080
I mean, if this game gets by, why hasn't someone done that yet?

1896
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,080
Maybe they need to.

1897
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:52,040
Super Mario Brothers or Great Giana Sisters, I don't know, take your pick.

1898
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,040
That is pretty serious.

1899
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:56,800
I thought when I first was reading the subject of the story, I was like, oh, maybe Apple's

1900
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,120
not doing anything about the people that are copying the iOS, but you're talking about

1901
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:02,640
they've actually approved and highlighted games that were just ripped off of shit on

1902
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:03,640
the internet.

1903
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:04,640
That's crazy.

1904
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,800
It is actually promoted to the What's Hot section.

1905
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:10,080
I have a feeling a lot of that runs on an algorithm, though.

1906
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:15,680
I don't think that they necessarily specifically targeted that game to promote.

1907
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:16,680
I think you're right.

1908
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:17,920
It's probably getting a lot of downloads.

1909
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:22,200
It's probably been getting a lot of downloads because of the coverage, honestly.

1910
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:24,200
Is it a pay game, though?

1911
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:27,240
Yes, it is a pay game.

1912
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:28,360
Pay games aren't worth it.

1913
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:31,800
By the way, AlphaCananagram, I don't know if you saw this, he's following up in chat

1914
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:34,200
saying they have taken it down since then.

1915
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:37,040
So it is no longer there.

1916
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,880
But look at what it took for that to happen.

1917
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,880
I think that's still fairly notable, you know what I mean?

1918
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:43,280
Nobody saw that right away.

1919
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:47,120
But of course, if I'm working at Apple and I'm testing these apps, am I gonna recognize

1920
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:48,300
this game?

1921
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:49,300
Probably not.

1922
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:54,780
You know, they don't do the peer review thing like XNA does, where lots of people are prone

1923
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:57,080
to recognize stuff that's ripped off.

1924
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:00,660
But if it's just like a couple people at Apple, I mean, I would never recognize that this

1925
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:01,660
game was ripped off.

1926
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:03,640
I'd never played the original.

1927
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:11,000
So in that way, I can kind of sympathize, but I guess they do need something else.

1928
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:15,320
Maybe they need a quicker way to stake your claim if you do believe you've been ripped

1929
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:16,320
off.

1930
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,320
Maybe that's what they need.

1931
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:18,320
I don't know.

1932
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,320
Maybe.

1933
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,320
We'll see.

1934
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:29,560
Alright, so let's move on to another story that has to do with the Rock Band Network.

1935
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,800
Woohoo, Rock Band!

1936
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,840
Rock Band Network 2.0 is coming out in February.

1937
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:39,380
February 15th is the date to be exact.

1938
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:42,200
That's when the new track creation system will come out.

1939
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:47,360
All songs currently being made for Rock Band Network, they must be done by February 14th

1940
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,880
when 1.0 will be phased out.

1941
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:54,300
And then everything after that for Rock Band Network 2 will require Rock Band 3.

1942
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:58,420
I'm assuming this means because of, you know, the keyboards and all that other stuff.

1943
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:01,180
So there you go.

1944
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:05,760
By the way, Rock Band 3, sadly not doing too well on the sales charts, did it?

1945
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,160
It didn't do too well after Christmas, did it?

1946
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:09,160
That's too bad.

1947
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,160
Still awesome.

1948
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,160
Still awesome.

1949
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,440
I agree.

1950
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:14,520
Maybe forcing people to upgrade will do some good.

1951
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,440
Maybe they should just cut slash the price of the game to 20 bucks and watch it fly off

1952
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,440
shelves.

1953
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,480
Hey, I have a friend that bought the Pro Guitar.

1954
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,480
Oh yeah?

1955
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:23,480
Yeah.

1956
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:24,480
It's pretty heavy.

1957
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,480
It's pretty cool too.

1958
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:34,080
Alright, so with that, I guess we're going to get into the mailbag at mailbag.orangeloungeradoo.com

1959
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:37,720
is the place where you send us emails every week.

1960
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:41,520
So we're going to get into the mailbag.

1961
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:51,720
Well, we actually, well, the mailbag kind of sucks because we've got nothing in it.

1962
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,920
Read the spam!

1963
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,080
Well, we don't have any spam either.

1964
01:43:56,080 --> 01:44:01,040
So I dedicate this to everyone who did not send an email.

1965
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,040
I'll take the box!

1966
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,040
The box!

1967
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,040
You took the box!

1968
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:05,040
Let's see what's in the box!

1969
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,040
Nothing!

1970
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:07,040
Absolutely nothing!

1971
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,040
Stupid!

1972
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:09,040
You're so stupid!

1973
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,040
Stupid!

1974
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:11,040
Stupid!

1975
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,040
Stupid!

1976
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:13,040
Stupid!

1977
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,040
Stupid!

1978
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:15,040
Stupid!

1979
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,040
Stupid!

1980
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:17,040
Stupid!

1981
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,040
Stupid!

1982
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:19,040
Stupid!

1983
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:29,080
You're so stupid!

1984
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:30,080
Nice.

1985
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,080
Yeah.

1986
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:35,520
You know, that's the movie that Dan and I got engaged over.

1987
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:36,520
I know.

1988
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:37,520
I remember that.

1989
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,520
Yeah.

1990
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:41,240
You want a drink from the fire hose.

1991
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,240
You know what's funny?

1992
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,240
Wheel of Fish.

1993
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,880
I don't think I've ever seen that movie from start to finish.

1994
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,280
No, the best thing.

1995
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,280
Badgers!

1996
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:49,280
Badgers!

1997
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:53,560
We don't need no stinking badgers!

1998
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:56,240
Weird Al needs to do another movie, don't you think?

1999
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:57,560
He totally does.

2000
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,560
Alright.

2001
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,560
Uh, let's move on to the FUs of the week.

2002
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:03,640
What an appropriate time to get into this segment.

2003
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:21,040
Now I know we have some of these.

2004
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:27,960
F you to certain situations that are beyond my control that involve finances and my house.

2005
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:28,960
Logie?

2006
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:35,560
Uh, F you to the people at A&W for not knowing how to fill up a half gallon of root beer.

2007
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:41,360
It was actually, not to mention, it is impossible to transport this without it spilling everywhere

2008
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:45,600
as it was, and um, it made it very difficult to drive.

2009
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,680
I will never be buying a half gallon of root beer again, it is just too much root beer.

2010
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:51,320
Half gallon of fucking root beer, Logie.

2011
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,800
It's a half gallon of root beer.

2012
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,120
It's not carbonated enough.

2013
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:55,120
I don't understand why.

2014
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:57,320
A&W from the tap is supposed to be the bomb too.

2015
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:59,000
Yes, it's really sweet though.

2016
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
It's really, really sweet.

2017
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
It's like drinking syrup.

2018
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,480
Their diet root beer is excellent though.

2019
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:07,880
But yeah, I like their root beer.

2020
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:10,880
Uh, my FU of the week, I have to be vague.

2021
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,720
There's actually a lot of stuff going on but nothing I can talk about on my public show,

2022
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:15,840
so F you to stuff.

2023
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:16,840
That's all stuff.

2024
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,840
There you go.

2025
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:22,360
So, let's get back to some gaming news.

2026
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:25,400
Then the Skype line in just a little bit after a couple more stories.

2027
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:26,560
Logie, you need to cheer me up.

2028
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,280
Do you have a story that might cheer me up?

2029
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:29,280
Um, yes.

2030
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:34,160
It's about the brand new Yogi Bear movie.

2031
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:36,280
No, I'm not cheered up.

2032
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:39,840
No, it's about Tiger Woods and a weird glitch.

2033
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,280
This really isn't cheering me up.

2034
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:47,380
It's about a weird glitch that is being reported, I don't even know if we should take this seriously,

2035
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:48,960
by The Sun.

2036
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:53,240
Yes, the tabloid magazine in the UK.

2037
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:59,520
Apparently there was a glitch that this one woman has encountered, Brit and Joe, um, Elay

2038
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:06,080
or whatever, apparently her avatar that she had set up on there, one day, when she popped

2039
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:08,120
on the game, it was topless!

2040
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:10,200
Oh, now you have my attention.

2041
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,200
What?

2042
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:12,200
What's this?

2043
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,200
Nipples and everything.

2044
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:14,200
What?

2045
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:22,600
The, uh, the avatar is topless and of course EA was quick to say that, um, there is no

2046
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:28,080
possible way that that could have been done without some sort of hack.

2047
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:33,600
But as we've seen with, you know, games like Heavy Rain, I could believe that it could

2048
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:40,360
be done, um, you know, granted she doesn't actually have like boob textures or whatever,

2049
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:45,120
you know, the nipple bumps are there for like the clothing and stuff, but I don't think,

2050
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:49,920
I think that just for some reason it's not drawing the clothing on.

2051
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:53,840
But, uh, she's topless and playing golf.

2052
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:54,840
Boobies!

2053
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:56,520
You know what?

2054
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:00,080
You get those women topless and playing golf, I bet you a lot more people-

2055
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:04,960
I bet, I bet Tiger Woods would sell like twice as many copies as it does now.

2056
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:09,120
Tiger Woods, the M-rated golf game.

2057
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:11,440
There you go.

2058
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:14,840
Well, it just took a story about boobies to cheer me up a little bit.

2059
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:15,840
Tiger Boobs.

2060
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:16,840
Tiger Boobs.

2061
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,520
I like that.

2062
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:25,360
All right, Xbox 360 is going to be seeing the return of some Wonderswan color shoot-em-ups.

2063
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:26,720
That's right, that's awesome.

2064
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:30,240
Judgment Silver Sword, I guess, is one of those games.

2065
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:33,920
It was originally designed in a homebrew competition in 2001.

2066
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,900
It was published in 2004.

2067
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:38,700
It's now coming back on the Xbox 360.

2068
01:48:38,700 --> 01:48:43,880
Judgment Silver Sword and the remix Cardinal Sins, they are both going to be coming out,

2069
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:49,120
I guess, their bonuses in a new 360 retail shmup, Eshkatos?

2070
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:50,920
I don't know if I'm saying that right.

2071
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:53,520
Of course, all these games are coming out in Japan.

2072
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,040
There's two trailers for this game that are out there on the internet.

2073
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,040
You can import it on March 24th.

2074
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:02,640
I like this because I guess there's like one trailer here that shows like a split- because

2075
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:07,800
you know how like vertical shmups on the 360 don't use much real estate on the screen at

2076
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:08,800
all?

2077
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,600
Like there's all this wasted horizontal space.

2078
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:16,160
Well in this game- sorry it's a little loud, sorry guys.

2079
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:19,160
It looks very pretty, I gotta say.

2080
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:22,520
Like some of the effects they're doing and stuff, but then there's one part of the trailer

2081
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:28,800
here where they're showing multiplayer in like three screens on the screen at once.

2082
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,680
That's cool.

2083
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,960
That's very cool.

2084
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:36,880
And then they're dodging lots and lots of bullets.

2085
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,880
They're dying.

2086
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,680
WonderSwanColor shmups making a return on the 360, but only in Japan!

2087
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:45,520
Which makes sense because WonderSwanColor was only out in Japan, never came out here.

2088
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,920
It was such a good system too.

2089
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,460
Our Skype line is now open!

2090
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:56,000
You can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2091
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,780
You can go ahead and give us a call, we'll talk about whatever it is you want to talk

2092
01:49:58,780 --> 01:49:59,780
about.

2093
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:02,280
In the meantime, should we see if there's any last minute stories because I know it

2094
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:06,560
takes about a minute till the folks that are listening hear us begging for calls.

2095
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:11,240
There's a rumor, well we talked a little bit about this, the 3G and stuff, and the OLD

2096
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:15,000
screen on PSV2 already, I'm assuming, that was in Twitter Topics now that I think of

2097
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
it.

2098
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Yep.

2099
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Okay, nevermind.

2100
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,720
I had to pull it up and I was ready to go and everything.

2101
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,720
Sorry.

2102
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:26,280
I know I have more stuff to talk about here, I just have to pull it up.

2103
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,280
Do do do.

2104
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,280
Ummm.

2105
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,280
What was I gonna say?

2106
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:31,280
Words?

2107
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,280
Words, yes.

2108
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:42,280
Specifically, no I was gonna say that those people out there that are thinking about possibly

2109
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:46,880
hacking your Playstation 3 using the readily available custom firmwares that are out there,

2110
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:53,820
you may remember that they have ways of tracking you down, so make sure you get one of those

2111
01:50:53,820 --> 01:51:02,360
things that erases your game history or something like that.

2112
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:10,080
A lot of the new programs have that built in so that you don't get caught, I guess.

2113
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,680
LA Noire.

2114
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:16,960
That was a game that also had a trailer leaked out for it.

2115
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:24,080
Also gonna be coming out from Take-Two in May, this on May 17th, big game for Rockstar.

2116
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:27,120
I mean it looks awesome.

2117
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:31,200
So that'll be coming out in the middle of May there.

2118
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:36,200
Also Plants vs. Zombies and Peggle coming to the Android Marketplace the second quarter

2119
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:37,560
of this year.

2120
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,560
Pretty neat.

2121
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:47,080
Again, the phones are open, 1-877-GAM-OL-R or use the name on Skype is Orange Lounge

2122
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:48,080
Radio.

2123
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,080
It's gonna be another one of those nights.

2124
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:54,200
Get your lazy butts up, pick up your phone, and give us a call.

2125
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:57,160
If you have something to say, I mean, you're just gonna sit here on the line.

2126
01:51:57,160 --> 01:52:02,760
Talk about a video game and you better not be, um, what's your face?

2127
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:05,960
Now see, I saw this story and I thought of you, Jamie.

2128
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:12,600
Epic Mickey, you're talking about 10 different Easter eggs that are in this game from different

2129
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:14,200
Disney history and stuff like that.

2130
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:22,280
For example, in the game, actually in Mickey Junk Mountain, they actually have a basketball

2131
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:27,840
court in that part of the game as well.

2132
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:28,840
That's cool.

2133
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:32,200
They kind of allude to the basketball court that's in Matterhorn.

2134
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,640
Let's go to the phones, we do have a call on the line.

2135
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:36,040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2136
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:37,040
Who's this?

2137
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,040
Hi, can you hear me?

2138
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:39,040
Uh, we sure can.

2139
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,040
Who is this?

2140
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:41,520
Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.

2141
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,920
DDR Dollar Bill, what is on your mind?

2142
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:44,920
Hey, not much.

2143
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:50,080
Um, I took your advice a couple weeks ago and then I actually picked up a, well, I guess

2144
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:54,080
you can call it an indie game, but one that's been getting a whole bunch of hype from everybody.

2145
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:55,080
What's that?

2146
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:56,080
Minecraft.

2147
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,080
Ah, okay.

2148
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:01,040
Now, for those that didn't hear, you called in a couple weeks ago and I believe it was

2149
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:04,440
something about, I am just frustrated with games today.

2150
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:09,280
It's same shit, different year, you know, I feel like there's no games for me to play

2151
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:10,800
and I said, well, try indie.

2152
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:14,120
So you went for a popular indie title, but an indie one nonetheless.

2153
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,120
Minecraft.

2154
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,120
What do you think of Minecraft?

2155
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:18,120
Hello?

2156
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:21,100
Did we lose him?

2157
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:22,100
Can you still hear us?

2158
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:23,100
God damn it.

2159
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:24,100
I think we lost.

2160
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:25,100
Hi, can you hear me?

2161
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:26,100
Yes, we can now.

2162
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:27,100
Hi.

2163
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:28,100
What did you think of-

2164
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:29,100
Oh, pfft.

2165
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,100
Hi.

2166
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:31,100
Stupid microphone.

2167
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:32,100
Did you mute yourself?

2168
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,100
Hi, can you hear me?

2169
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,100
What did you think of Minecraft?

2170
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:38,600
Um, for a beta, I'm very impressed.

2171
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:39,600
Yeah?

2172
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:46,000
Yeah, it's weird in that it's the total freedom to do anything.

2173
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:51,800
It's almost like, I feel like I have nothing to do, but I'm just enjoying just doing nothing.

2174
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:54,200
Okay, I have never played Minecraft.

2175
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,960
I read a lot about it on the interwebs, but I've not played it.

2176
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:59,340
So can you like, tell me what Minecraft is?

2177
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:02,680
What do you do in Minecraft?

2178
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:11,640
The best way I can say this is, you pretty much make stuff to sort of build, well the

2179
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:16,460
idea is that you pretty much have to build your shelter and your tools and everything

2180
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:21,480
out of different parts you find here and there, and during the day, and you have to make good

2181
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:28,400
shelter because at night, you get invaded by zombies and skeletons and spiders, so you

2182
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:33,040
want to be safe at night, and then you do the same thing every day, like daytime you

2183
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:39,920
build stuff and raise trees and make flowers and kill animals for food, and at night you

2184
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:42,080
pretty much either hide or you defend yourself.

2185
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:45,840
Okay, so there is like kind of an actual game to it, because I was always under the impression

2186
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:50,720
that there really wasn't a lot to it outside of like creation and building, so that's kind

2187
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:51,720
of cool.

2188
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:55,480
Okay, so you're trying to prevent, I guess, zombies from eating your face.

2189
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:58,840
I like stuff, so that's kind of cool.

2190
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:04,100
So did this help kind of break your video game blahs, or are you still looking for that

2191
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:08,400
game that just makes you love video games again?

2192
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:13,960
It sort of helped kill the blahs because I also realized that I'm pretty much a PC gamer

2193
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:17,600
for life now.

2194
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:22,760
I've pretty much shied away from PS3 and Xbox, and I like playing on a PC a lot better.

2195
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:23,760
Why?

2196
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,720
I'll give you an example.

2197
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:31,800
I tried out the demo the other day for Mass Effect 2 just for shits and giggles.

2198
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:37,880
It ran so much better on my computer than on the Xbox or PS3.

2199
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:42,680
So it's more a matter of you feel like the technology that the games need today, maybe

2200
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:45,160
the console cycle's gone on too long.

2201
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:49,120
You know, let's face it, the 360's been out now, it's going on its fifth year, right?

2202
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:51,960
So maybe it's time for some new consoles?

2203
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:59,360
Either that or some heavy updates and whatnot, because my computer's not that old either,

2204
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:04,240
but it was running circles around the console, so I was like, what the hell?

2205
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:11,280
Well a lot of it has to do with your video card as well.

2206
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,280
That's a big part of it too.

2207
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:14,320
So you have a newer video card in your system?

2208
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:20,060
Yeah, I mean I got one just last year, it's still a newer one.

2209
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:26,360
My process is old, but it's one of those things where logically it doesn't make sense, but

2210
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:27,360
it just works.

2211
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:30,600
I'm going to a chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.

2212
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:33,800
Bochi Kawa says, Minecraft is like Legos, the RPG.

2213
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:37,800
You know there is actually a really fun, just a Lego builder game that is on the official

2214
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:38,800
Lego website.

2215
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:42,240
It's not really a game, it's like a tool where you just have a virtual box of Legos and you

2216
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:45,700
can put together whatever, and then of course it's to sell more Legos.

2217
01:56:45,700 --> 01:56:49,740
You click a button and they will send you the bricks you need to make your thing.

2218
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:50,740
You just built.

2219
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:51,740
Which I think is kind of amazing.

2220
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:52,740
Oh wow.

2221
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:54,360
I know right?

2222
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:59,720
Some other comments in chat, Bonds006 says, Same here, I will always be a PC gamer.

2223
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:03,040
And Alex P. Carson says, PC greater than fucking anything.

2224
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,400
So you have some people supporting you on your side.

2225
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:06,400
Absolutely.

2226
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:07,400
Awesome.

2227
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:08,400
Alright.

2228
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:11,600
Well, DDR Dollar Bill, we're going to let you go to get some more calls, but any quick

2229
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:13,600
final thoughts for our listeners?

2230
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,280
Uh, yeah.

2231
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:16,280
Support PC gaming.

2232
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:17,600
Alright, we'll try.

2233
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:21,320
And hey, Steam is going to save PC gaming, if it hasn't already.

2234
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:22,320
Hey, Steam rocks.

2235
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:23,880
Alright, and the indie stuff of course.

2236
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:25,440
Alright, have a good one buddy.

2237
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,440
You too, thanks guys.

2238
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:31,480
Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype if you want to give us a call.

2239
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:33,800
Any other last minute stories for us?

2240
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:34,800
I have nothing.

2241
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:35,800
Aww.

2242
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:36,800
Um, sure.

2243
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,440
You'll just have to make something up.

2244
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:41,360
Dark Soccer, wait, no, I want Dark Soccer to make something up.

2245
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:43,040
Make up a video game news story.

2246
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:46,040
Something that actually didn't happen.

2247
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:51,720
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

2248
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:55,280
I'm putting her on the spot people, it's live radio.

2249
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:56,280
Chirp.

2250
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,280
Chirp.

2251
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,520
Oh, a new Angry Birds game is coming out?

2252
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:05,560
Yeah, a new Angry Birds versus Dark Soccer.

2253
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:08,680
Angry Birds versus Angry Co-host.

2254
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:12,600
I was going to say Angry Birds versus Zombies.

2255
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:18,960
Of course, because everything indie these days is something something versus zombies,

2256
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:19,960
right?

2257
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:20,960
Indeed.

2258
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:22,200
Let's go to another call.

2259
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:23,200
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2260
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,200
Who's this?

2261
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:25,200
Hey, this is X-Link.

2262
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:26,200
Hey buddy, how you doing?

2263
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:27,200
Hey, doing good.

2264
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:30,880
I got to play with the PS3 move for my first time.

2265
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:33,080
Ah, what'd you think of the PS3 move?

2266
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:35,560
I, I, depending on the game, I really like it.

2267
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:43,720
Um, though I did like the, um, bowling, um, and, um, the, um, the, the sports one they

2268
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:45,680
had out, it was, it was pretty fun.

2269
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:47,560
It was, it was a lot of fun.

2270
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:52,960
It had a lot of similarities to that of Wii, but it, the, the graphics and the way they

2271
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,600
did it was a lot better.

2272
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:58,840
The, um, output and the way it was controlled was, I think, for personally, for me, it was

2273
01:58:58,840 --> 01:58:59,840
a lot smoother.

2274
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,840
So.

2275
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:04,920
Do you, I mean, maybe this is a really hard question to ask, but it's something I've given

2276
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:07,280
a lot of thought to myself is that, okay.

2277
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:11,200
And I've said this on the show before, you know, connect and move they're out there now.

2278
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:15,800
And most of the games that have come out originally are for the most part with a few exceptions,

2279
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:18,920
copies of Wii games, you know, and with nicer graphics.

2280
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:21,240
Where do you think the move goes next?

2281
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:24,760
Can you see the move integrated into Sony's core franchises?

2282
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:25,760
The world.

2283
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,640
It's going to become the world like that of.hack.

2284
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:33,920
We're going to have visors and everything, and it's going to become one big MMO.

2285
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:35,840
It already is in their core franchises.

2286
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:38,600
A lot of it seems, a lot of it really feels like an afterthought though.

2287
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:39,760
Like LittleBigPlanet 2.

2288
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:42,400
Yeah, the move supports there in a bonus level.

2289
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:43,680
No, I understand that.

2290
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:44,680
That's just retarded.

2291
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:47,160
That's just basically the prehistoric thing that's in there.

2292
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:54,400
Um, no, I'm saying it's in their core franchises as in SOCOM 4 and Killzone 3.

2293
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:55,680
Those are core franchises.

2294
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:56,680
Okay.

2295
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:59,360
Granted, I don't pay attention to a lot of the first person shooters.

2296
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:00,360
That's why.

2297
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:03,000
And I remember seeing that at the GDC even, but.

2298
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:09,200
Granted, their gun that they have, their little shell, is retarded looking.

2299
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:10,200
Just saying.

2300
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,040
No, I agree with you.

2301
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,640
I agree with you on that.

2302
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:18,280
I'm hoping that people will step up to the planet on those things and make stuff better,

2303
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:21,320
like actual better looking guns and stuff like that.

2304
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:26,520
Um, you know, like, for example, like Time Crisis with Namco, I like the guns they use.

2305
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:29,760
It makes you feel like you're playing the arcade with their actual guns, so the guns

2306
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:34,560
are quite different from that of the arcade because of the feedback and whatnot, but.

2307
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:38,840
And there's no pedal button, but still, I think they will do good.

2308
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:41,320
It's moving in the right direction, I believe.

2309
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:42,320
What was the-

2310
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:46,200
It's sad, though, because it's really killing off stuff like arcades and stuff that I grew

2311
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:47,480
up loving as a kid.

2312
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:49,720
It's just, you know, it's hard to compete.

2313
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:51,840
Well, I don't think the move killed that.

2314
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:57,560
I think Xbox Live and just the internet in general killed that.

2315
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:58,560
MMOs.

2316
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:02,520
Yeah, you know, MMOs for real used to be going to the arcade, you know.

2317
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:03,520
I don't know.

2318
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:04,520
It's depressing.

2319
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:10,360
Instead of booting up your computer or your Xbox and playing the games, yeah, it really

2320
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:11,360
was.

2321
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:14,280
And it was a lot of fun playing your quarters and stuff on top of the, you know, on top

2322
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:18,360
of, you know, in certain areas saying, hey, look, I want to be next, you know, or have

2323
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:20,720
to be, you know, waiting in line, you know.

2324
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:23,840
I guess maybe save that 20 minute wait from playing that one game that you really want

2325
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:24,840
to play.

2326
02:01:24,840 --> 02:01:28,080
But at the same time, too, you know, it's kind of sad, you know.

2327
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:32,720
That, you know, that feeling you got being around a big crowd and they're cheering you

2328
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:33,720
on and stuff.

2329
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:37,200
It's not really the same.

2330
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:43,280
Yeah, I think it would be cool if they would make, like, an MMO that kind of, you know,

2331
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:45,240
if you can't beat them, join them.

2332
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:47,280
Make an MMO about, like, going to arcades.

2333
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:48,280
That's what game room should have been.

2334
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:53,040
Like, an MMO where you're going to the arcade and playing these old school games and the

2335
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:56,560
better you get at games, the better you can skill up your character to maybe help you

2336
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:57,720
get, like, cheap.

2337
02:01:57,720 --> 02:01:59,800
I don't want to say cheap but get better in other games.

2338
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:00,800
I don't know.

2339
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:01,800
There's an idea there.

2340
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:02,800
No.

2341
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:03,800
I agree on that.

2342
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:04,800
That'd be cool.

2343
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:05,800
What's the best thing you played on Move?

2344
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:06,800
I'll kind of end it with that question.

2345
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:10,480
Well, unfortunately, I only played two different games, so probably the bowling because I did

2346
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:14,840
really well against my friends on that one, so the Bronx took bowling.

2347
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:15,840
Okay.

2348
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:21,240
Also, really quickly, Gearbox, I think, is going to do really great with the Duke Nukem

2349
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:25,360
because they did a really great job with Borderlands and their DLC.

2350
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:31,200
So if they keep it close to making somewhat of the original feel, from what I've seen

2351
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:33,800
from the trailers and stuff, I think they're going to do a really good job.

2352
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:37,240
It's going to be really, really interesting to see what they do with it.

2353
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:40,520
And I know they really are with their fans and what the fans want.

2354
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:44,220
So I wouldn't be surprised if they make some kind of mod so you can build your own strip

2355
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:48,320
club or build your own miniature bat.

2356
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:52,800
I would see a lot of that probably coming out near and down the road also because a

2357
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:57,640
lot of feedback has been really positive on it, and they really want what the people want.

2358
02:02:57,640 --> 02:03:01,560
So that's been a really good, positive thing too.

2359
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:07,960
One day we'll have our arcades again, but we'll take that next great invention to bring

2360
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:09,840
people back.

2361
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,720
More beer in arcades, that's what it really needs.

2362
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:15,400
Because you look at the arcades that are popular, Dave & Buster's, the Retro arcades, they all

2363
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:16,400
serve beer.

2364
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:20,720
Well, there's one by where I used to live, believe it or not, that did the same thing

2365
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:22,280
too, and it was very popular.

2366
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:23,280
Less kids, more beer.

2367
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:27,400
Again, it was beer at EDR, so I mean, pretty much go hand in hand, so yeah.

2368
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:28,400
All right.

2369
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:31,400
All right, well buddy, we're going to let you go to try and fit in a couple more calls,

2370
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,400
but have a good one.

2371
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:33,400
Yeah, you too.

2372
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:34,400
No problem.

2373
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,400
All right, thanks.

2374
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:36,400
Bye.

2375
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:37,400
All right, so let's go to another call.

2376
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:38,400
Hi.

2377
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:39,400
You're on Orange Mountain Radio.

2378
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:40,400
Who's this?

2379
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:41,400
Hey, it's Zappi.

2380
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:42,400
Hey, Zappi.

2381
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:43,400
How you doing?

2382
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:44,400
Oh, pretty good.

2383
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:45,400
All right.

2384
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:46,400
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2385
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:51,400
Well, I've been playing one of the big releases of the week, well, only big releases of the

2386
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:56,000
week, Little Big Planet 2, and I can't say more than, I mean, like, it's awesome.

2387
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,400
All right, so let me ask you some of the same stuff I asked Loki in the beginning of the

2388
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,040
show, because I haven't played the game yet.

2389
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:04,640
What did you notice right away, or maybe not right away, but what did you notice were some

2390
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:07,920
differences from Little Big Planet 1 when you played the game?

2391
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:14,480
I learned that there's, like, a lot more variety when I'm playing it, like, Little Big Planet

2392
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:18,640
1 was a good, solid platform, but with the second one, they really, like, tried to make

2393
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:24,600
it different, having, like, different, like, gimmicks in it, like, sort of, like, how they

2394
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:31,440
had notions for Mario World, where they, like, shook up the gameplay a little bit, and, like,

2395
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:36,800
for example, like, there's some levels that are just like, oh my god, I'm playing a shmup,

2396
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:43,200
or there's other ones where you're controlling a giant rabbit, like, they really, like, made

2397
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:47,120
it interesting and, like, they're like a full sequel instead of, like, just something, like,

2398
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:48,520
shoveled on.

2399
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,920
So what's some of the cool stuff you've seen in the user-created levels?

2400
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:53,680
I don't know if you've had a chance to dip in there, but have you seen any really cool

2401
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:56,760
user-created stuff yet?

2402
02:04:56,760 --> 02:05:01,040
One of the cool things I saw was they made an entire tower defense game out of the Little

2403
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:02,040
Big Planet engine.

2404
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:03,040
Oh, wow, nice.

2405
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:09,520
Yeah, I was kind of surprised that you do that, but they designed this in mind that

2406
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:15,360
you can basically take whatever game ideas you want and make it, which is really exciting.

2407
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:19,400
Speaking of taking whatever ideas you want and making it, I have to, and I apologize

2408
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:22,600
from deviating from your call a little bit, but, you know, in the last call, we were talking

2409
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:26,040
about ways to save arcades, and, of course, our chat room's going off on that.

2410
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:33,320
sj100matt says, tits could save arcades, and xlink says, now, that could be a good idea,

2411
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:35,480
so maybe you need to mix strip clubs with arcades.

2412
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:41,560
When in doubt, show some tits, right, DarkSakura?

2413
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:42,560
How about some cock?

2414
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:44,400
All right, well, that could work, too.

2415
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:47,480
There could be something for everybody, absolutely, I agree.

2416
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:48,480
Boobs and nuts.

2417
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:49,480
Equal opportunity.

2418
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:50,480
Boobs and nuts.

2419
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:52,480
Boobs and nuts.

2420
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:57,400
You know, there was an old-ass game on the NES, I really apologize, by the way, there

2421
02:05:57,400 --> 02:06:01,880
was an old-school game on the NES years and years ago, it was only out in Japan, not out

2422
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:06,720
here, it was called Nuts and Milk.

2423
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:11,880
I shit you not, look it up, it's on Wikipedia, Nuts and Milk, and that could be the name

2424
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:13,880
of the arcade.

2425
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:14,880
What's that?

2426
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:16,840
How does that get past censors?

2427
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:22,320
Because it's Japan, it's not the same, they don't have the same slang, it's different,

2428
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:23,320
so all right.

2429
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:28,520
Oh yeah, LittleBigPlanet 2, so have you played the Nuts and Milk remake in LittleBigPlanet

2430
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:29,520
2 yet?

2431
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:33,800
I'm sure it's coming along any day now, but unfortunately no.

2432
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,760
Oh, okay, that's too bad.

2433
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:40,400
All right, so, anything else you've been playing lately, just LittleBigPlanet 2 taking up your

2434
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:41,400
time, or any other games?

2435
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:46,080
I've also been playing some Dead Space, the first one, looking forward to the new one

2436
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:50,720
that's coming out this week, and I can't believe you missed this game in 2008 because it's

2437
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:51,720
really fun.

2438
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:57,440
Because it went off my radar for so long, I'm going okay to make a second one, there

2439
02:06:57,440 --> 02:07:04,240
must be something to it, and I can't believe it, it's really going back to the survival

2440
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:08,120
horror roots, where you're actually being freaked out, like you're thinking that something

2441
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:11,600
is around that next corner, and there might be.

2442
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:16,360
It kind of sucks when games like, you find out about them like three years after they

2443
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:21,140
were out, and then like, by the time you're like, this game was fucking rad, you found

2444
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:24,800
out that the development studio got closed, and everybody got laid off, like I bet you

2445
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:27,720
anything that's gonna happen to blur.

2446
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:32,040
When the game's down to 20 bucks, if it's not already, it'll start selling more copies,

2447
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:37,360
and then people are like, wow, they should really make a sequel to this, oh shit, they

2448
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:38,360
should.

2449
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:42,600
Yeah, it's a shame that happened, like blur was pretty fun.

2450
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:46,400
Alright, well anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight before we let you

2451
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:47,400
go?

2452
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:48,800
I don't know, that's it.

2453
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:52,280
Alright, well have fun with LittleBigPlanet 2, hopefully I'll be playing it pretty soon

2454
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:55,560
as well, just you know, gotta wait to save up the money.

2455
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:56,560
Okay.

2456
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:58,560
Alright, later buddy.

2457
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:03,720
877-Game-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a

2458
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:04,720
call.

2459
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:07,960
If you want to give us a call, call came in from Canada.

2460
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:09,280
Maybe he had said that before, he was kidding.

2461
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:13,160
My friend just got back from Toronto, actually, he's coming back in tonight, you know, Grandpa

2462
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:18,440
Warcraft, went to Toronto, went to Toronto and just coming back tonight.

2463
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:19,440
Cool.

2464
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:22,560
Yeah, I want to go to Toronto, I've never been.

2465
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:24,400
Here it's really fun, Vancouver's awesome though.

2466
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:25,400
I want to go to Vancouver.

2467
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:28,440
Like how can Toronto be better than Vancouver, I'm sure there's a lot of people living in

2468
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:33,520
Toronto that are mad at me for saying that, but seriously, Vancouver is awesome, awesome.

2469
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:35,600
Let's go to the phones, there's more calls coming in.

2470
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:38,720
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2471
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:39,720
This is Chortles.

2472
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:40,720
Chortles!

2473
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:41,720
Hi buddy, how are you?

2474
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:42,720
Hey.

2475
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:44,720
Hey, what's on your mind tonight?

2476
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:45,720
Chortles?

2477
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:52,160
Um, honestly, I was just considering, is it just me or is it PlayStation, like, okay let's

2478
02:08:52,160 --> 02:09:00,160
put it this way, you know how Activision, is it true that you on PlayStation Network,

2479
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:05,920
these publishers have to put out the servers themselves for the multiplayer?

2480
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:14,640
Because I've been considering that in the wake of, like, okay I'm not sure if I'm overhearing

2481
02:09:14,640 --> 02:09:19,600
this, but basically, have you heard the reports about PlayStation Network getting hacked recently?

2482
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:21,600
Loki, is that something familiar to you?

2483
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:23,680
The PlayStation Network's been getting hacked recently?

2484
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:26,760
I don't follow that stuff as well, so you don't really.

2485
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:30,920
I'm sure somebody's trying to hack it.

2486
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:34,520
Which probably includes PlayStation Network and all this stuff with the Modern Warfare

2487
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:35,520
and so on.

2488
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:38,440
Yeah, I'm sure you've heard that.

2489
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:41,600
I just want to jump quickly back to your question about the whole central servers and who's

2490
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:42,960
really running them.

2491
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:46,880
I think to some extent the publishers are running, I mean, I don't know the ins and

2492
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:50,880
outs of games, but like for example, EA, we just had a story on them a couple weeks ago

2493
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:54,280
that they were shutting down the servers for a bunch of old sports titles.

2494
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:59,280
So I think they do run servers, I think what Microsoft and PlayStation, what they're running

2495
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:02,560
is kind of like the matchmaking and distribution services.

2496
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:06,040
When you download upgrades and so forth, it's coming from their servers because they're

2497
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:07,880
getting a cut of the profits.

2498
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:11,560
When you're connecting to find opponents, it's probably through them.

2499
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:14,760
But then when you're actually playing the game, it's probably through the publishers.

2500
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:20,140
I also would cite things like DC Universe, which is sort of a gray area because that's

2501
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:23,240
Sony Online Entertainment, so maybe less.

2502
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:25,640
But what about things like Final Fantasy XI?

2503
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:32,520
I mean that game, people forget it's on the 360, but it is, and it is such a unique game

2504
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:34,200
because it has two front ends.

2505
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:38,400
It has Xbox Live, which you don't even need gold, but then you use it to basically connect

2506
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:43,800
to Play Online, which is really the central, I mean, Final Fantasy XI literally breaks

2507
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:47,040
every single rule you know about Xbox Online.

2508
02:10:47,040 --> 02:10:50,760
And nobody's playing it on the Xbox, which is interesting.

2509
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:56,400
I guess most people aren't looking to it for Final Fantasy XI, but the reason I was wondering

2510
02:10:56,400 --> 02:11:02,000
that is because on the one hand, you know, you have the whole idea about, oh, you get

2511
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,000
–

2512
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Yeah?

2513
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Go ahead.

2514
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Yeah.

2515
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I'm sorry.

2516
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:11,160
I just realized that I'm actually hearing what we just said previously for like a few

2517
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:12,880
seconds later as background echo.

2518
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:16,560
Good old school first rule of calling into radio, turn down your radio because it throws

2519
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:17,560
everybody off.

2520
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:18,560
It's all right.

2521
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:19,560
Yeah.

2522
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:20,560
Fair enough, man.

2523
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:21,560
Yeah.

2524
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:30,440
I was just considering that in the fact that Activision has a deal with Microsoft to have

2525
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:33,760
released the DLC first on 360.

2526
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:38,080
Isn't that likely for the next two Call of Duty's at least as well?

2527
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:42,360
I'm not sure of the specifics of the agreement, but it's certainly not uncommon that one console

2528
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:45,440
gets download content that the other consoles don't get.

2529
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:46,440
That's –

2530
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:47,440
At least earlier.

2531
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:48,920
I think buying exclusives for forever.

2532
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:52,600
You wanna cite another example, look at what's going on with the PlayStation 3 and Portal

2533
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:54,840
2, which we talked about in the rapid fire news earlier in this whole like –

2534
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:55,840
Oh, I heard about that.

2535
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:56,840
Yeah, the cloud –

2536
02:11:56,840 --> 02:11:58,720
Is Portal 2 coming to 360 by the way?

2537
02:11:58,720 --> 02:11:59,720
It is.

2538
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:00,720
Okay.

2539
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:04,320
But Sony is really trying to do everything they can to make theirs, and this is the quote

2540
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:08,840
from what they said at E3, the definitive version of Portal 2.

2541
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:09,840
Uh-huh.

2542
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:10,840
Ooh.

2543
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:14,880
Well, which is really funny considering that that means free access to the other two versions.

2544
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:20,560
Yeah, I mean to the home computer versions, which come to think of it, that's actually

2545
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:22,520
a business model I really like.

2546
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:32,240
You pay for the game once, and then you have the game period in whichever way it's playable

2547
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:33,600
other than 360.

2548
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:37,640
I love that model too, and think about the caller that called in – I don't know if

2549
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:41,560
you heard the guy earlier that called in saying that he's all about PC gaming now because

2550
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:45,320
consoles just aren't doing it for him, and the games run better on his PC.

2551
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:47,880
I think he'd be frothing at the mouth about an idea like that.

2552
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:52,400
Imagine buying Mass Effect 2 on the PlayStation and you get it on all consoles.

2553
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:55,680
Yeah, like that would be my sort of thing.

2554
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:59,120
I mean, I could not get enough of that.

2555
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:08,080
I mean, it's funny that he revived his love of PC games because – okay, I'll just

2556
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:10,760
let you know what I've been doing over the winter.

2557
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:18,600
Basically, I think one of the only games that I bought for a console in 2010 was Assassin's

2558
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:19,600
Creed Brotherhood.

2559
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:22,560
Mind you, that was a launch game.

2560
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:24,480
It was immensely satisfying for a while.

2561
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:30,960
I don't regret that purchase, but then after a while it petered out, especially when it

2562
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:35,880
came to trying to get good connectivity for the multiplayer, and while there were some

2563
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:40,800
severe issues with lag and multiplayer –

2564
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:41,800
The baby escaped.

2565
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:47,640
There's a baby in the background that appears to have escaped.

2566
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:48,640
You know what?

2567
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:55,920
Let me put it this – I'm not going to pretend how she would know the word lag.

2568
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:59,520
I'm just going to leave it at that.

2569
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:01,120
Dark Soccer, can you get CPS on the line?

2570
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:02,120
No, I'm kidding.

2571
02:14:02,120 --> 02:14:03,120
I'm kidding.

2572
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:04,120
All right.

2573
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:11,200
I'm sorry if this is boring everywhere when it's listening in, but basically I found

2574
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:18,160
that over the holidays I was doing my Christmas shopping, and unlike last year, I found that

2575
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:21,640
there wasn't much that I was looking for in the way of Steam.

2576
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:26,000
I mean, yes, I know about the legendary Steam holiday and summer sales.

2577
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:31,160
I have partaken of them in past years, but this time I found that even though I was sitting

2578
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:36,840
on a nice chunk of change, I mainly just wanted to upgrade my hardware.

2579
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:43,440
For example – okay, main thing that I changed is my video card.

2580
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:51,840
Originally I was using onboard video, don't ask, but as a result, basically this time

2581
02:14:51,840 --> 02:15:02,280
around I decided to upgrade to a Radeon HD 5770 made by MSI, one gigabyte.

2582
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:10,260
I think a lot of the draw for me was the cooling, like two fans, three heat pipes, a heat sink.

2583
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:15,400
It was pretty cool stuff, and so far it seems to run all my games decently.

2584
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:20,520
You know, I think with the PC it's really about the hardware, making the right choices

2585
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:23,240
with that, and if you invest with that, you're going to get a huge payback.

2586
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:27,600
I mean, I know I upgraded my video card last year so I could run Warcraft better, which

2587
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:29,520
is the only PC game I need to be playing.

2588
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:30,520
No, I'm kidding.

2589
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:31,520
There's lots of them.

2590
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:32,520
Oh, no, no.

2591
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:36,200
Hey, I've played World of – like, I've played World of Warcraft for a long time.

2592
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:40,880
I jumped – like, I took the weak trial for Cataclysm, but I'm not paying for that right

2593
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:47,360
now, although I will give this advice to anyone who plays World of Warcraft.

2594
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:51,680
Even if you take a break in the form of, like, canceling your subscription or not playing

2595
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:54,120
a while, get the Battle.net authenticator.

2596
02:15:54,120 --> 02:15:59,240
Like, if you don't already have it and you use a smartphone, just get the mobile authenticator.

2597
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:02,240
Because you don't want people using your account while you're not there.

2598
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:07,360
Yeah, I've actually had that happen to me in – like, in the summer of 2010.

2599
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:13,480
Like, two weeks after – two weeks after my subscription ran out, boom, my account

2600
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:15,080
was hacked.

2601
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:18,840
A lot of stuff – a lot of stuff got stolen.

2602
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:26,160
My – like, my all-time highest level item got jacked, and by the time I found – by

2603
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:33,280
the time I found out, got my account unhacked, and got back into World of Warcraft, it was

2604
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:35,560
too late for Blizzard to recover my stuff.

2605
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:39,600
Yeah, and it's a story I have heard way, way, way too many times.

2606
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:43,120
But, Chortles, I've got to wrap up and let you go, because if I keep letting you talking,

2607
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:44,680
pretty soon they're going to give you our time slot.

2608
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:46,920
So I've got to wrap up and let you go.

2609
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:47,920
Find the baby!

2610
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:51,520
Well, if I set out, I'll probably have – I'll probably be more focused next time,

2611
02:16:51,520 --> 02:16:52,520
I suppose.

2612
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:54,160
That baby has walked out the front door by now.

2613
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:55,160
Go get him.

2614
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:56,160
All right.

2615
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:57,160
Yeah, all right.

2616
02:16:57,160 --> 02:16:58,160
All right.

2617
02:16:58,160 --> 02:16:59,160
Bye.

2618
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:01,280
Thank you, Chortles, for that call.

2619
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:03,560
He was just really happy to be here.

2620
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:04,640
He just – he sounded happy.

2621
02:17:04,640 --> 02:17:05,640
I like enthusiasm.

2622
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:06,640
Brains!

2623
02:17:06,640 --> 02:17:07,640
Brains!

2624
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:08,640
Give him the call.

2625
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:09,640
He was just enthusiastic.

2626
02:17:09,640 --> 02:17:10,640
Brains.

2627
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:11,640
You're saying it was a zombie baby in the background?

2628
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:12,640
Yes.

2629
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:13,640
I'm – all right.

2630
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:14,640
Be nice.

2631
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:15,640
All right.

2632
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:16,640
Thank you so much for the Skype line tonight.

2633
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:17,640
Thank you guys so much for calling us.

2634
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:19,840
If you didn't get through tonight, please consider sending us an email.

2635
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:24,360
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails to.

2636
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:26,280
We would really appreciate it.

2637
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:27,940
All right.

2638
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:29,800
Let's wrap up the show.

2639
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:30,800
We're done.

2640
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:31,800
Is there any other last-minute stories we've got to get out?

2641
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:32,800
Ribbons and bows, Rob.

2642
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:33,800
Ribbons and bows.

2643
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:34,920
Spanking on the butt.

2644
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:35,920
It's done.

2645
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:36,920
Slack.

2646
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:37,920
I have nothing.

2647
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:38,920
All right.

2648
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:41,560
Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought, and we'll start with Loki

2649
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:42,560
tonight.

2650
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:43,840
Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

2651
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:50,240
My sound card decides when it decides to work and not – and I don't like that.

2652
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:54,720
My final thought is I took Friday off, so yay for four-day work week next week.

2653
02:17:54,720 --> 02:17:55,720
Woo!

2654
02:17:55,720 --> 02:17:57,680
Dark Soccer, you have a final thought?

2655
02:17:57,680 --> 02:17:58,680
Reject false icons.

2656
02:17:58,680 --> 02:17:59,680
Ooh.

2657
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:00,680
You're going old school.

2658
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:01,680
I am.

2659
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:04,280
I didn't expect you to whip that out until episode 400.

2660
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:07,240
Let me whip this out.

2661
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:08,240
She's just getting warmed up.

2662
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:09,240
Yeah.

2663
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:10,240
It's been a very long time since I've heard that one.

2664
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:11,760
I'm warming up my bitch-slapping hand.

2665
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:12,760
All right.

2666
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:16,280
Well, thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting Independent Podcasting.

2667
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:17,840
You know, we don't play commercials.

2668
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:21,520
We don't ram, you know, stuff we're trying to sell down your throat.

2669
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:24,000
If you like the show, all we ask, tell friends about the show.

2670
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,720
We'll ram other things down your throat.

2671
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:26,720
Shh.

2672
02:18:26,720 --> 02:18:27,720
Stop.

2673
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:29,720
Like candy.

2674
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:32,840
Dark Soccer is like, I got a lollipop.

2675
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:34,240
Tell friends – I'm trying to do a plug.

2676
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:36,400
This is a very important plug I'm trying to do here, Dark Soccer.

2677
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:37,400
Stop derailing me with your toilet humor.

2678
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:38,680
Are you plugging it already?

2679
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:39,960
Stop it.

2680
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:45,160
Go on to iTunes or whatever favorite podcast site you use and leave us a nice review.

2681
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:46,320
We would really appreciate it.

2682
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:48,960
Five Star Reviews on iTunes helps go a long way to promote.

2683
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:50,520
Tell your friends about the show.

2684
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:54,920
Tell people you think would be interested in people talking about video games and giving

2685
02:18:54,920 --> 02:19:01,680
folks a voice and hearing people call in and just talk about games they really like.

2686
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:02,680
That's it.

2687
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:03,680
Tell your kids.

2688
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:04,680
Tell your wife.

2689
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:05,680
That's right.

2690
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:07,280
And tell your husbands because we're gaming everybody out there.

2691
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:08,280
Exactly.

2692
02:19:08,280 --> 02:19:09,280
I think.

2693
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:10,280
We're going to do it for another week.

2694
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:13,280
We will be back next week to do it all again.

2695
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,280
I'm so excited.

2696
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:15,280
I just can't hide it.

2697
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:16,280
We'll see you next week.

2698
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:19,560
