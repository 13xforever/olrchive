00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:25,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Tonight, January 23, 2011, the 3DS US launch gets some details, Final Fantasy games get sequels and new names, and after over a decade, we finally have a release date for Duke Nukem Forever.

2
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:38,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:45,162
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live with our 398th episode on this January the 23rd of 2011.

4
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:48,105
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts, joining you every week.

5
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:52,429
[SPEAKER_07]: With me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:52,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

7
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:54,190
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you, DarkSakura?

8
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I have hobbit shoes.

9
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:57,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Why am I not hearing you at all?

10
00:00:57,072 --> 00:00:57,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I muted?

11
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:59,494
[SPEAKER_07]: The fabulousness of live radio.

12
00:00:59,614 --> 00:01:00,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Try again.

13
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:00,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better.

14
00:01:01,115 --> 00:01:01,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

15
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:02,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wearing my hobbit shoes.

16
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:04,177
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the hobbit shoes?

17
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:07,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Vibram Five Finger multi-sport shoes.

18
00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:09,429
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the shoes that look like feet.

19
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:10,390
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not really shoes.

20
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a picture.

21
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:13,393
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like Spiderman webbing that go on your feet.

22
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:14,754
[SPEAKER_02]: They're foot gloves.

23
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:16,936
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the strangest things I've ever seen.

24
00:01:17,116 --> 00:01:22,400
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're comfortable and when they break in they're supposed to be really good for your feet and give you a natural stride.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you play DDR in those?

26
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:24,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

27
00:01:25,023 --> 00:01:26,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people do it before.

28
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:26,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Might be interesting.

29
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:29,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Play some Dance Central.

30
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:30,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Shake your booty.

31
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:31,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to play Dance Central.

32
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:32,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play Dance Masters.

33
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:33,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

34
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:34,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Dance Central's great.

35
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:35,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Para, para.

36
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Masters gets old after like the first five songs you play.

37
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:40,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't care.

38
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:40,936
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, whatever.

39
00:01:40,956 --> 00:01:43,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if Tech Master Loki cares.

40
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:43,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Loki.

41
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:45,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care about Dance Masters.

42
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't hear you either.

43
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,360
[SPEAKER_07]: What is going on?

44
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,761
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called ill preparation.

45
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:50,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently.

46
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:52,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what this is all about tonight.

47
00:01:52,642 --> 00:01:53,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus that mic.

48
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:54,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Something's up with it.

49
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:55,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

50
00:01:55,343 --> 00:01:57,064
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been getting quieter and quieter every week.

51
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,485
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because I'm talking quieter and quieter.

52
00:01:58,505 --> 00:01:59,525
[SPEAKER_07]: They get really loud!

53
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:00,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

54
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:03,106
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we have to be careful how we tune it for you.

55
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:04,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I do that on purpose.

56
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:04,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

57
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how's your week been, Loki?

58
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:07,168
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been fine.

59
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:07,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

60
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:08,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times?

61
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:10,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything exciting going on with the baby?

62
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:11,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Growing?

63
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting older?

64
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:11,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting older.

65
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:16,344
[SPEAKER_06]: He's eating some... He's starting solid foods, I guess.

66
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:17,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the avocado post.

67
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:23,349
[SPEAKER_06]: He's eating avocado, rice cereal, and... What else?

68
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:25,771
[SPEAKER_07]: When's it okay to start feeding a baby bacon?

69
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:27,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Not for a long time.

70
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:28,473
[SPEAKER_07]: What a bummer.

71
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:32,596
[SPEAKER_06]: He's getting... Well, it's avocado, rice cereal, and... Cheerios!

72
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:34,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's actually it.

73
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:35,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Avocado and rice cereal.

74
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,942
[SPEAKER_06]: But then he's going to be eating... I think carrots this week.

75
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:43,462
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

76
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:10,619
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just fabulous.

77
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:13,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Our 400th episode is going to be the same day as the Super Bowl.

78
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we really have anything exciting planned, though.

79
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:21,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just, I don't know, it's just, after this long... I have something exciting planned.

80
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:24,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you've got a little something.

81
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:28,111
[SPEAKER_02]: But both of you need to actually stay instead of depart super quick after the show.

82
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I've offered I don't know how many times, but anyway.

83
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:33,715
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not the one I'm worried about, Loki.

84
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:34,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

85
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:36,357
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

86
00:04:05,432 --> 00:04:10,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I made level 75 on World of Warcraft and got two of my friends to play.

87
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:13,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Addict.

88
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:14,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm the dealer.

89
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,863
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Pyramid Scheme, I say.

90
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:20,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Pyramid Head Scheme.

91
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:32,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played some Portal and some more Mushihime-sama and lots of Solitaire because I was at school.

92
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:43,262
[SPEAKER_02]: and I updated and installed my own Linux Mint 10 by myself on two computers and fixed the networking problems.

93
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:50,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I know I've heard you talk favorably of Linux Mint before as something you like to use as another OS besides just Windows.

94
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:56,375
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the advantage, I guess, of doing Linux on one system and Windows on the other?

95
00:04:57,015 --> 00:05:02,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically in the case of my netbook, it uses less memory and less space.

96
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:09,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I need to, I can actually boot it off of a USB that I've installed Linux on.

97
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:22,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So, say that this computer that I'm on now, say that something goes haywire in it, all I have to do is boot it off Linux and I can run through the file system, and if I need to delete something, I can.

98
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:23,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

99
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It works on everything.

100
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:25,921
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

101
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's it for DarkSakura's Gaming Week.

102
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,801
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll move on over to Loki.

103
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,502
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your Gaming Week?

104
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:56,723
[SPEAKER_06]: It was okay.

105
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:58,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a couple things.

106
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:02,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried, I don't know, just the hell of it.

107
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:09,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried that one free game that was made by that 14-year-old or something like that, some bubble something or other.

108
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:13,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was okay for a few minutes.

109
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:16,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, wow, this looks like a really cheaply made game.

110
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got bored with it.

111
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:19,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you think it's doing so well?

112
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:21,045
[SPEAKER_07]: This is that iPhone, iTouch game.

113
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:31,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, because people like fucking human interest stories, and because people are simpletons, and they like free shit, and as long as it has a good storytelling, well, I better support it, because a 14-year-old made it.

114
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:32,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

115
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,013
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, 14-year-olds make a lot of shit.

116
00:06:36,774 --> 00:06:37,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually.

117
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:40,035
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, whatever.

118
00:06:40,055 --> 00:06:45,838
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the same people who like Angry Birds, so, you know, what am I... It's not a stretch for them, I guess.

119
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:46,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

120
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:55,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I literally dusted off my PS3 to finally put the 500... Those things are dust magnets.

121
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:57,674
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't dust them off.

122
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:58,495
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll turn gray.

123
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:17,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I dusted it off, and I finally installed my 500 gig hard drive that I had for it, and then I did the noble thing, and I installed a custom firmware on it, and now all my systems are modded as they should be.

124
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:18,335
[SPEAKER_07]: You're so proud.

125
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:23,117
[SPEAKER_06]: It was seriously the black sheep of the bunch, and now it's all perfect.

126
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:35,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I've read stories about systems bricking and stuff like that, but seriously, if you just wait a little bit to make sure everything's okay, let the dust settle, you're all good.

127
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:37,848
[SPEAKER_06]: So easy to do.

128
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:40,250
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seriously scary.

129
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:41,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did that.

130
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:45,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And then played a little bit of Planet 2.

131
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:47,055
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of that.

132
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:49,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a few levels.

133
00:07:49,717 --> 00:07:50,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, just one online level.

134
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's fun.

135
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I like LittleBigPlanet 1.

136
00:07:55,782 --> 00:07:56,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that was a fun game.

137
00:07:56,903 --> 00:07:59,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And LittleBigPlanet 2, obviously very similar to that.

138
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,966
[SPEAKER_06]: They have some new features that they added in there.

139
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really care for the grappling hook too much.

140
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:04,469
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

141
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:24,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if it's just the design of the DualShock 3 analog sticks or something like that, but for some reason, I was having issues with it trying to swing my character back and forth and having the grappling hook change length, which would normally be controlled by the up and down on the analog.

142
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:30,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I'm not pushing up and down on the analog, it was just very... The dead zones for it were really...

143
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:33,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Really large, I guess.

144
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:40,857
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was difficult to accurately get it to swing and adjust the size of the grappling hook and stuff like that.

145
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So it actually killed my character one time.

146
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:45,908
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright, it's kind of cool.

147
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:53,713
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I played someone's user-created levels, the first-person shooter Resident Evil thing, and that was actually kind of cool.

148
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:58,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely different and a good indicator of what you can do with LittleBigPlanet 2.

149
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:03,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was also a top-down RPG game that someone made, which I tried out.

150
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,441
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty cool.

151
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:31,048
[SPEAKER_06]: so um lots of unique stuff and I like how they're kind of hinting at some of the things that you can do in like the first few levels like they have the ability where you can link two different levels together or more than two levels together so like for example say you want to create you know like a Mario Brothers game you can do that you can create all the different levels and just link them all together and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before somebody does create Mario Brothers in LittleBigPlanet it's probably already happened actually oh I'm sure it already has

152
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,131
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really cool.

153
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:44,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trying to play it for the longest time, but trying to be able to play a game on my big TV is not really working out for me.

154
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, though, and this will also kind of help out with...

155
00:09:48,244 --> 00:09:50,587
[SPEAKER_06]: If I have to ever stream DJ Hero 3 or something.

156
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a new capture card for my laptop that I can just plug in USB.

157
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:59,379
[SPEAKER_06]: So it allows me to play games and just hook straight up to my laptop and I can play it off the screen.

158
00:09:59,399 --> 00:09:59,920
[SPEAKER_06]: No lag.

159
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,287
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'll give me an additional screen to play a little Big Planet on.

160
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:11,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com There's some people that are asking about your hacking habits.

161
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:14,856
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf says, Now you never have to pay for another game.

162
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:15,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

163
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:19,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is a very tongue-in-cheek comment from BlackWolf because he's actually very anti-video game piracy.

164
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,101
[SPEAKER_07]: But, Loki, you do still buy games.

165
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:27,124
[SPEAKER_07]: You bought, what, like seven copies of Grand Theft Auto 4 on various systems or something?

166
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,745
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like you don't pay for games.

167
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:33,927
[SPEAKER_07]: So then I guess this leads to the question from AkumaJP.

168
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what is the benefit of custom firmware for the PS3?

169
00:10:37,668 --> 00:10:38,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of things.

170
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:42,229
[SPEAKER_06]: One, you can play all the different homebrew stuff that they have on there.

171
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:45,030
[SPEAKER_06]: You can add different features to your system.

172
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,851
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just really early, so a lot of the stuff we don't know yet what you're going to be able to do with it.

173
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:58,454
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, there's definitely the backing up portion of it that you can back up games and pirate stuff if you want to.

174
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:00,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Will I do that?

175
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:04,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not, because I had the ability to jailbreak my PS3 for the longest time.

176
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:09,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually had the tools to do it, but I just didn't... There was no reason.

177
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:15,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally sat there going, well, I could do this and pirate a bunch of games, but there's no real games I want to play.

178
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:18,091
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, that's sad.

179
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:24,217
[SPEAKER_06]: If I really don't want to... If there's nothing I really want to play on there, then I don't know.

180
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:42,906
[SPEAKER_07]: but as long as I've known you and as long as I've been doing this show with you you've always kind of been the type to me that just likes to do it because you can like you know because somebody's like you're not supposed to hack your PS3 to be able to run this and you're you're very much the type that's like well yes I can you know I'm gonna do it anyway pretty much yeah

181
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:44,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So, alright.

182
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:45,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

183
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it for your gaming week?

184
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:51,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I wanted to ask you something about Little Big Planet 2.

185
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:52,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

186
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:54,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Little Big Planet 2.

187
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,010
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned there's some new features and so forth.

188
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,432
[SPEAKER_07]: What was one of the first things that jumped out to you you noticed was different about the game from Little Big Planet 1?

189
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:02,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

190
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:08,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean the springboards, I guess.

191
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:11,498
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like the first thing that they show that's different.

192
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it did import my character and all my stuff they had collected in the first game, which is kind of cool.

193
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:25,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't... There's not a lot right now that's different.

194
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:37,811
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a few different things, but I mean, I know that the game is going to be really... Because it's kind of... I'm still going through the first few levels of the game, or the tutorial levels, you know, so they haven't really introduced a ton of stuff yet.

195
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:41,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just very much like the first game right now.

196
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:42,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

197
00:12:43,956 --> 00:13:11,163
[SPEAKER_06]: but that's alright because the first game was awesome I do like how they had some voice acting in the game like the cutscenes, the cutscenes are actually very unique and then also like how and I'm not sure if the Da Vinci character or whatever is voiced by John Cleese but it sounds like it and then later on because they only have voice acting through the cutscenes through the rest of the game he's just kind of mumbling and it sounds like John Cleese mumbling which is kind of funny

198
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they had gotten his talent to voice something.

199
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:18,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was that, but maybe a different... No, it was Fable 3 I'm thinking of.

200
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:19,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he was the butler.

201
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:33,083
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

202
00:13:55,098 --> 00:14:22,369
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's for the phones and it's basically a DOS emulator for the iPhone and what you can do is that there's various like DOS games that were actually kind of included in the little store that come with it like Duke Nukem the original side scroller is in it and Wolfenstein 3D the shareware episode is available there and so on and let's see I can actually fire up I'm going to fire up Wolfenstein 3D here real quick on the phone so you can kind of see this and

203
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:29,931
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing that kind of sucks about it, which actually is a really big drawback, is that, again, the iPhone makes for a shitty controller.

204
00:14:30,051 --> 00:14:30,892
[SPEAKER_07]: A very shitty controller.

205
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:36,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially when there's like eight different buttons on here to be able to play this, which is next to impossible.

206
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:46,797
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can kind of like... I don't know if you can hear the old school AdLib sound effects there in the mic, but... Yeah.

207
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:46,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

208
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:48,889
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

209
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:19,974
[SPEAKER_06]: The only one I wanted to get that got pulled immediately was Minecrafted, which was the Minecraft client for... Really?

210
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:21,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even know they had that.

211
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:22,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was very brief.

212
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:27,662
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be coming back later, but it was a leaked version of it.

213
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny that you mentioned Duke Nukem and stuff like that.

214
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:41,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Duke Nukem was on the store, I think, already, and then Wolfenstein's actually available through, well, through Cydia if you have a jailbroken device.

215
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:42,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I don't.

216
00:15:42,103 --> 00:15:42,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

217
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:42,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I...

218
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I know hella people jailbreak their iPhone and they even came out in the courts and said that you can or whatever, but I don't know.

219
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:55,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all paranoid about that stuff because this thing is like my life, my texting, my phone.

220
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't have it go wrong.

221
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:02,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not worth it to relive Wolfenstein 3D all over again, you know what I mean?

222
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:03,135
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

223
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:04,756
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of my perspective on it.

224
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:07,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so that was really it for my gaming week.

225
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, just more of the same stuff.

226
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:13,395
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, WoW, Pac-Man, the new Championship Edition Deluxe, and so forth.

227
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:15,657
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's it for my week.

228
00:16:16,297 --> 00:16:18,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's news.

229
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,561
[SPEAKER_07]: You can, of course, follow us on Twitter.

230
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:22,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

231
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:27,125
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also available on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

232
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:35,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course we do tape live at All Games Radio, AllGames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.

233
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:40,471
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever do want to come in and join a live episode, please do join us sometime.

234
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:45,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you can sync your iPhone with a PS3.

235
00:16:45,313 --> 00:16:47,934
[SPEAKER_06]: They were saying use it as a router for a controller.

236
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you don't even have to really necessarily do that.

237
00:16:50,275 --> 00:17:03,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Some actual homebrew programs through like Cydia and stuff like that allows you to sync a Wii Remote to your iPod or iPad to play Nintendo or Super Nintendo games.

238
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,960
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not worth it.

239
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:06,901
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty awesome, though.

240
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:07,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Too much.

241
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:09,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Too much work for not enough payoff.

242
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:10,342
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

243
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to tonight's news.

244
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:14,684
[SPEAKER_07]: We will start off with, of course, the one and only Loki tonight.

245
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:17,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so it's kind of sad.

246
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:24,306
[SPEAKER_06]: They were trying to find a buyer for Bizarre Entertainment or Bizarre Creations or whatever.

247
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:29,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, Activision was unable to do so.

248
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:37,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, dude, they put out some pretty awesome racing games and hell, they had a pretty awesome arcade shooter game.

249
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:46,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe no one wanted to buy the developer of the original Project Gotham games and Geometry Wars, which was huge.

250
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft, hello!

251
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:49,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm shocked.

252
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:50,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Shocked.

253
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:55,542
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, this is kind of a trend if you think about it.

254
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:56,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at Harmonix.

255
00:17:57,283 --> 00:18:00,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, no buyers for Harmonix either, other than themselves.

256
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:03,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, maybe just people aren't snapping up...

257
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:06,285
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

258
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:24,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on, though.

259
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,750
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you expect?

260
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,531
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is Activision's fault.

261
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:28,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

262
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,531
[SPEAKER_06]: This is plainly their fault.

263
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:36,094
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you expect when you release a okay first-person shooter the week before Black Ops?

264
00:18:36,474 --> 00:18:37,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

265
00:18:37,195 --> 00:18:38,255
[SPEAKER_06]: You expect it to do well?

266
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:38,495
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

267
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:39,996
[SPEAKER_06]: They expect it to die.

268
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:43,477
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

269
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:49,380
[SPEAKER_06]: It could have done a lot better if it was released in a different part of the year or next year or whatever.

270
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really was, oh, well, we have the license to the Bond series.

271
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:54,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, crap, they're not making another movie.

272
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:59,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we need to make some money off of this license we paid for, so let's make a game.

273
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:03,366
[SPEAKER_07]: And ironically, now they are making another Bond movie.

274
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:04,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they announce that a couple weeks ago?

275
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:06,468
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're just making another game?

276
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:06,908
Huh.

277
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:08,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

278
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:09,009
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not bizarre.

279
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just such a bummer.

280
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:31,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I had heard somewhere, I don't remember, it was earlier in the week, so forgive me if my memory is a little rusty, but there's some type of new tax in, I don't know if it's Britain, the greater part of Britain, or if it's just this area that the Bizarre Creation studio is in that has something to do with video games that actually may have had an impact that maybe was too expensive to keep these guys up and running where they're at now.

281
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:37,608
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those, you know, it's cheaper to get folks in another country to do the development or whatever.

282
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:43,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, they're basically recommending that they close them now is the recommendation, I guess.

283
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:48,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess they recently did the same thing with Budcat in the U.S.

284
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:57,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm hoping that, you know, it's one of those for every door that closes and other opens type of scenarios where at least these guys might get, you know, on their feet somewhere else.

285
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:02,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe they'll do that thing where they start up their own darn studio, which we've seen a lot of developers in the past do.

286
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:03,419
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know.

287
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Try some different ideas.

288
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:09,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe that means there's never going to be another Geometry Wars game.

289
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:09,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, whatever.

290
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:11,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless, well, I don't know.

291
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:12,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like that series.

292
00:20:12,284 --> 00:20:13,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I ain't really going to improve upon that, I mean.

293
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:26,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you could look at it that way but I and I guess technically what Activision would own that so they could always have one of their other developing houses do it but I don't know just it wouldn't be the same yeah

294
00:20:27,913 --> 00:20:29,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's too bad.

295
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:32,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com for some comments.

296
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:40,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Isam in our chatroom says, this is probably a time where they would rather purchase intellectual properties to re-release rather than take on new employees.

297
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,280
[SPEAKER_07]: AlphaCanadagram says, WTF?

298
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Geometry Wars 2 was the shit.

299
00:20:45,761 --> 00:21:04,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, Geometry Wars 2 is awesome and it's kind of a bummer but maybe since the Xbox Live Arcade especially and I guess to some extent the PlayStation Network is pretty easy to develop for I mean, I don't know, I'm not a video game developer but I am assuming that what, the folks that put out Super Meat Boy not exactly a large development studio, correct?

300
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't it like three or four different people kind of buds getting together doing this game?

301
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:08,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much.

302
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:14,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted it's not on PlayStation Network but it could have been because I think they have some dealio with Microsoft

303
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:34,629
[SPEAKER_07]: so my hope maybe these guys that end up losing their stuff at Bazaar can kind of go and develop maybe for these smaller platforms like handhelds and Xbox Live Arcade the Geometry Wars-esque sort of games or whatever other ideas they might have because you know Blur was a pretty good idea too that was a

304
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:56,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think if there had been a Blur 2 it would have been awesome Blur 1, it was a good game but it did need some work but I love that idea of the arcade racer meets Mario Kart and the commercials for that were always so awesome where it was the little Mario Kart cute characters that are practically getting run over by the adult cars or better yet, make it an arcade game

305
00:21:57,788 --> 00:21:58,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps.

306
00:21:59,089 --> 00:21:59,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps.

307
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Derek H in our chatroom seems to agree with me.

308
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:04,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope the people from Bizarre reform a new studio.

309
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:06,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope so too, or at least a good portion of them.

310
00:22:07,236 --> 00:22:08,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear Respawn's hiring.

311
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:11,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Never know what might happen.

312
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,659
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving on to some other news.

313
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:19,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And this has something to do with kind of like basement development, if you will, on a very large scale.

314
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:26,122
[SPEAKER_07]: StarCraft II, of course, you know, has some very flexible development materials, we'll say, in the game.

315
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:29,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And people have been able to make all sorts of games within StarCraft II.

316
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:36,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, there's an endorsed by Blizzard shooter that's actually in the game, like a shoot-em-up type game that's there.

317
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,626
[SPEAKER_07]: StarCraft Universe StarCraft Universe

318
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:08,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there were some teasers that were up on the internet and they got pulled pretty quickly.

319
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Blizzard put the smackdown on those and took them down.

320
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:18,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people were saying, Boo, Blizzard, you guys are a bunch of bastards for taking this stuff down.

321
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would you do that?

322
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:30,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And the modder who created this, Ryan Winzel, even kind of went on his own forum saying, I don't really know what's going on right now, you guys.

323
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,196
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all kind of developing at a fast pace.

324
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:32,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the deal.

325
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:43,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Activism Blizzard is actually not trying to shut down this mod altogether, but I think the problem that they're having is that it's the World of Starcraft name that they don't like.

326
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:47,447
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want this guy making his mod called World of Starcraft.

327
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:51,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like this MMO is actually going to continue on, but under a new name.

328
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:59,956
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, Ryan Wenzel, the modder, has actually been invited by Blizzard to go meet the Starcraft 2 development team.

329
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:01,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

330
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:03,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, this whole thing expanded so fast.

331
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:07,802
[SPEAKER_07]: He was also invited by the folks that made the MMO League of Legends.

332
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:10,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've seen that, but that's like Defense of the Ancients.

333
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:14,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that is a game I did get to see like 15 seconds of a little bit this weekend.

334
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:18,469
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my friends is into that, and it's like a Defense of the Ancients kind of like game, the old mod.

335
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:21,951
[SPEAKER_07]: The people that make that invited this guy to go interview with him.

336
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:25,333
[SPEAKER_07]: So his net celebrity went up exponentially real quick.

337
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:26,014
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

338
00:24:26,034 --> 00:24:26,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of cool.

339
00:24:26,774 --> 00:24:30,097
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cool that he was invited by Blizzard, though, because Blizzard was like, dude, dude, dude.

340
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:33,098
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the mod we're not cool with.

341
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,219
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the name.

342
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully they're going to be able to work this out.

343
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:37,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Blizzard wanted to make it clear.

344
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:47,587
[SPEAKER_07]: It was never our intention to stop development on the mod, but with the name so closely resembling that of World of Warcraft, we wanted to discuss the title of the mod with the developer.

345
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:54,271
[SPEAKER_07]: And as part of our routine procedure, we contacted YouTube to request the video be removed while that discussion took place.

346
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:58,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Such a little politically correct way of saying that.

347
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:00,215
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

348
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:01,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, huh?

349
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:04,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's like we're not trying to be jerks, but no.

350
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,261
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all branding and identity.

351
00:25:08,602 --> 00:25:19,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what's going on here, the unsaid part too, is it's a lot of that big company syndrome where I'm sure the developers actually kind of had their eyebrows raised going, that's kind of cool what this kid did.

352
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:24,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the legal team and the protections of all this were like, hell no, shut it down.

353
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,635
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't protect it, you lose it.

354
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:26,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

355
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:31,537
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think whereas the development team was like, yeah, come on over and play with us for a day.

356
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:32,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what you're up to.

357
00:25:32,977 --> 00:25:37,218
[SPEAKER_07]: The legal team was like, hell no, you need to shut it down under this name.

358
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:40,559
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of interesting how that all works together.

359
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:43,039
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds very corporate to me.

360
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what else is stupid?

361
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,260
[SPEAKER_07]: What is stupid?

362
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:48,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo.

363
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:49,681
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

364
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:50,601
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't say.

365
00:25:51,255 --> 00:26:07,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, basically, they were talking to Kotaku and said that they didn't see any reason to put in some sort of trophy or achievement system because they don't want to tell people how to play the games to get some kind of, quote, mythical reward.

366
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,300
[SPEAKER_02]: The U.S.

367
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:19,323
[SPEAKER_02]: exec Bill Trennan quoted saying, basically, the way the games are designed is they're designed for you to explore the game yourself and have a sense of discovery.

368
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:24,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's like, we don't want to give you directions on what to do in the game.

369
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,213
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to find everything on your own.

370
00:26:27,595 --> 00:26:28,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, I understand that.

371
00:26:28,697 --> 00:26:31,341
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said that they're not really against the idea of trophies.

372
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:35,247
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't want it to be the whole purpose for playing the game.

373
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:37,891
[SPEAKER_06]: They believe that except for Super Smash Bros.

374
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:38,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl.

375
00:26:38,772 --> 00:26:39,852
[SPEAKER_02]: In which case they don't care about that.

376
00:26:39,872 --> 00:26:40,692
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I said.

377
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:43,372
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not against them.

378
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:47,113
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that they don't want that to be the full basis of the game.

379
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:57,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think they want to license the rights to... You know how a lot of these people copyright different things or have patents for trophy systems and stuff like that.

380
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,215
[SPEAKER_06]: They probably just don't want to license that crap.

381
00:26:59,815 --> 00:27:01,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea and neither do I care.

382
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:03,176
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just they...

383
00:27:04,742 --> 00:27:07,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of think it's interesting that they went on a limb to say this.

384
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:08,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Since everybody else is doing it.

385
00:27:09,506 --> 00:27:16,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Once Xbox started having it, PlayStation had it, and they have them in MMOs and all kinds of stuff.

386
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:18,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Even on our phone.

387
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:21,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to not embrace something that's popular right now.

388
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:25,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Online gameplay, whatever, we don't need that.

389
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Trophies, we don't need that.

390
00:27:28,204 --> 00:27:30,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Organized community, whatever.

391
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:32,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

392
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:38,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I get this story and all, but it strikes me a little bit as a reason that's invented after the fact.

393
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:48,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the Wii simply was not programmed to have this type of functionality in it, and I sort of get that because the Wii doesn't have anything like Xbox Live, like PlayStation Network.

394
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:56,131
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no centralized Wii service, except for, granted, Wii Connect 24, the thing that lets you send the mails and all that stuff, and the friend code to play online.

395
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:57,812
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know, like, it just...

396
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:05,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know enough about how computers talk to each other and how the internet actually works, but it doesn't strike me as quite the centralized system that the other two are.

397
00:28:05,356 --> 00:28:07,997
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be patched in later if they really wanted to.

398
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:09,658
[SPEAKER_06]: They did it with the PSP.

399
00:28:09,998 --> 00:28:11,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they're launching a new console.

400
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,960
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they could kind of roll it out with that if they wanted to.

401
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

402
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:22,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I just feel like there might be a little more value in virtual console, especially if they're going to try to get us to buy the same games again on the 3DS.

403
00:28:23,864 --> 00:28:29,868
[SPEAKER_07]: to have some type of trophy room for actually having played these games and getting scores on them.

404
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:35,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, even if it's just a freaking high score table, fuck, I'd take Game Center over nothing.

405
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:36,433
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

406
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:43,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And Game Center, not that great, but it's better than... I also personally don't care about achievements myself.

407
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:46,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I just play the games to enjoy them and have fun.

408
00:28:48,242 --> 00:28:53,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, I get that, but it's sort of like, it's kind of nice to have that little pat on the back.

409
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:55,147
[SPEAKER_07]: To have that in your portfolio.

410
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:59,030
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason I've tried to get any achievements in World of Warcraft is for the experience.

411
00:28:59,631 --> 00:29:01,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, I've got experience points for it.

412
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:02,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

413
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:03,393
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

414
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:06,095
[SPEAKER_07]: You get experience points for doing like quests and stuff.

415
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I got them for getting the exploration ones.

416
00:29:09,193 --> 00:29:10,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, because you get experiences.

417
00:29:10,354 --> 00:29:11,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I get it.

418
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,517
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, I don't care.

419
00:29:15,717 --> 00:29:22,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I laughed at that one because I thought it was funny, but other than that, it was like, okay, someone did something that they were going to be doing anyway.

420
00:29:22,522 --> 00:29:27,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, since you bring that up, Blizzard also doesn't really have a centralized server for achievements.

421
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:29,627
[SPEAKER_07]: This came up on a previous episode of Horde House.

422
00:29:30,027 --> 00:29:34,450
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't link your StarCraft and your Warcraft achievements together right now.

423
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe when Diablo comes out, there'll be some type of Blizzard centralized thing.

424
00:29:39,693 --> 00:30:06,100
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, that'll only ever be for Blizzard games It's never going to connect to the Steam And all the Steam achievements I get that it's starting to get a little fragmented It is a little silly that you have your set on the Wii And your set on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 And it really should just be about beating the game start to finish But I don't know, I sort of like having that little sticker in my book That says, you did something really weird in this game Rob, I know how we can fix that problem How?

425
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,179
[SPEAKER_06]: We send out patches.

426
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:26,786
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm pretty sure that's where the whole idea of achievements on the 360 came from in the first place.

427
00:30:46,654 --> 00:30:53,703
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a bummer, actually, that when they did Game Room, you didn't have any type of resurgence of this, you know what I mean?

428
00:30:53,723 --> 00:30:57,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess there were the little trophies in Game Room, but it wasn't quite the same, you know?

429
00:30:57,747 --> 00:31:04,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Because patches are expensive, and if a publisher doesn't have to make unnecessary expenses like that, they won't.

430
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

431
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:46,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Spaginator in our chatroom says I wonder if they'll ever be a Diablo MMO It's kind of World of Warcraft actually When I first played World of Warcraft I was feeling a lot more Diablo than I was Warcraft Because Warcraft is an RTS And World of Warcraft really isn't So it's interesting Derek H says he had a patch for Barnstorming And DefectiveCandy says my grandfather had one of those patches So some people remember those patches

432
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:48,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, see, that's the thing.

433
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:49,429
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how awesome it was.

434
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:51,391
[SPEAKER_06]: People are still talking about them today.

435
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,475
[SPEAKER_06]: See, if they did that now, that would be awesome.

436
00:31:54,615 --> 00:31:56,957
[SPEAKER_06]: People would be talking about them for a long time.

437
00:31:57,938 --> 00:32:00,160
[SPEAKER_06]: But now, missed opportunity.

438
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:01,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about cash now.

439
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:03,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunate.

440
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:05,366
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, what else is in the news, Loki?

441
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:06,765
[SPEAKER_06]: 3DS 3DS 3DS

442
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:44,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really certain on which games are going to make the launch, although two that have been nailed down in the launch period by Nintendo, coming from Nintendo, unfortunately are Pilotwings and Nintendogs Plus Cats.

443
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:50,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked Pilotwings back on the Super Nintendo.

444
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,060
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked neat.

445
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,461
[SPEAKER_06]: The Pilotwings game looked neat.

446
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:54,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendogs and Cats...

447
00:32:58,174 --> 00:32:59,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the game's gonna suck.

448
00:33:00,098 --> 00:33:01,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

449
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,303
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, it looks awesome.

450
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:06,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awesome to try, but I don't want it.

451
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:09,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know I will get bored with it so quick.

452
00:33:09,914 --> 00:33:10,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

453
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I know exactly what you mean.

454
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:13,588
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like the original Nintendogs.

455
00:33:13,608 --> 00:33:15,809
[SPEAKER_07]: You read about it on paper and all the features they're putting in.

456
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,950
[SPEAKER_07]: You're like, oh man, this sounds like it's going to be really cool.

457
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:20,492
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I just know it, just like the first Nintendogs.

458
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:23,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I buy the game and it's going to be dumb after 30 minutes.

459
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:24,214
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

460
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:26,375
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, God.

461
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:28,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to feed it every day.

462
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:29,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to play with it every day.

463
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:33,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendogs is kind of, at least the original one, is kind of an overblown Facebook game.

464
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,500
[SPEAKER_07]: The original Nintendogs has a lot in common with a Facebook game.

465
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:40,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't explain it, but it's what it feels like to me.

466
00:33:43,473 --> 00:33:55,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the interesting things that they were talking about, which is kind of weird, is the system actually has a pedometer built into it and you get coins by walking around.

467
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:00,463
[SPEAKER_06]: So you earn coins that you can spend in games for different things.

468
00:34:02,242 --> 00:34:07,927
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they have an activity log or whatever attracts your gameplay as well as your steps.

469
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:17,255
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also talking about how you can make Miis in the interface and they have that cool feature where you can take a picture of yourself and they give you a bunch of different options for Miis and stuff.

470
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:19,217
[SPEAKER_06]: You can import your Miis from the Wii

471
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:20,622
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can't go the other way.

472
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:29,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just because it's... Well, because they say it's more complex than the Wii system.

473
00:34:29,674 --> 00:34:32,178
[SPEAKER_07]: The one on the 3DS is Wii 2.0.

474
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:35,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and it makes sense because if you think about it though, like...

475
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:37,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.

476
00:35:06,823 --> 00:35:08,243
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you guys think about that price point?

477
00:35:08,263 --> 00:35:08,923
[SPEAKER_07]: $250 for a 3DS.

478
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:10,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that's fair?

479
00:35:10,924 --> 00:35:11,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it's too much?

480
00:35:12,164 --> 00:35:14,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's some people on the internet that say, you know what, that's too much.

481
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:16,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's fine.

482
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:21,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it makes sense because they're not going to really have any competition right now.

483
00:35:21,646 --> 00:35:25,426
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guarantee that thing will be selling for a lot more than that.

484
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:26,947
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to be able to find these things.

485
00:35:27,587 --> 00:35:33,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get your orders in while you can and if you're savvy enough, buy two and sell one on eBay.

486
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:34,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

487
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:38,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of agree.

488
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:41,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the price point is actually better than what I was expecting.

489
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:49,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was going to be 3DS, $300 was what I was originally thinking they were going to do with it, but no, this is actually lower than I thought.

490
00:35:49,204 --> 00:35:52,887
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right at what I expected, based on what they put out the end retail price.

491
00:35:53,627 --> 00:35:54,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.

492
00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:59,249
[SPEAKER_07]: and it kind of leaves them a little room to lower it later.

493
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:02,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if they want to do a cut for Christmas, they probably will.

494
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:06,491
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they could cut it to 200 by Christmas with some type of package.

495
00:36:06,952 --> 00:36:07,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they will.

496
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:08,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they need to.

497
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:15,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be like the Wii where it was in short supply for a very long time and they're not going to cut that thing for at least a year.

498
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:17,935
[SPEAKER_06]: At least a year.

499
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:18,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings money.

500
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,222
[SPEAKER_06]: The price cut will come when probably a new system revision will come out.

501
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:27,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I guarantee you that thing will not be dropping in price by the end of this year.

502
00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:29,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Every kid will want one, too.

503
00:36:29,626 --> 00:36:31,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Every freaking kid.

504
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:33,088
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 3D without glasses.

505
00:36:33,328 --> 00:36:34,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

506
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:36,290
[SPEAKER_06]: People are like, oh, it's so stupid.

507
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:42,294
[SPEAKER_06]: People are just going to be blown away by just seeing the actual screens.

508
00:36:42,314 --> 00:36:43,375
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going to be blown away.

509
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:43,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

510
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:56,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even want to quote certain analysts, but there's people out there that have said they could have charged more than that and they could have still sold all the units that they had.

511
00:36:57,773 --> 00:36:59,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't know.

512
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:14,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at some of the comments in our chat room GameGuru says 250 is a bit too expensive for a handheld game system Tigerclaw says when you put the 3DS with the PSP Go from the price standing point the 3DS has the most features How much was the PSP Go?

513
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Was the PSP Go 250 as well?

514
00:37:15,622 --> 00:37:19,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but see, okay, there's a difference with the PSP Go and the 3DS, okay

515
00:37:21,027 --> 00:37:22,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

516
00:37:38,334 --> 00:38:05,212
[SPEAKER_06]: and you couldn't buy games for it in stores so it had people scratching their heads like why do you want me to get this there's no enhancements to it other than onboard storage which memory is so cheap nowadays it doesn't matter there's no UMD drive so I can't play any of the games I normally have right now there's no way for me to convert them into a digital format I have to re-buy my games if I want to buy the system um

517
00:38:07,757 --> 00:38:11,438
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some Bluetooth support, great.

518
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:24,583
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing is, and this is the best part, their retail partners or whatever, like GameStops and stuff like that, or just mom and pop shops, they weren't bringing them in.

519
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:33,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, GameStop might have because they have better partnerships with these guys, but individual mom and pop shops were not bringing them in because what money are they going to make off it?

520
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:35,367
[SPEAKER_06]: The system they're making no money on.

521
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:35,807
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

522
00:38:55,726 --> 00:39:01,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get to a couple more 3DS stories here and we'll kind of continue this discussion because there are some other interesting developments in the 3DS world.

523
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:04,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of it has to do with online play.

524
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:08,290
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, did you hear that the friend codes are getting reduced to one friend code?

525
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,151
[SPEAKER_07]: So sadly, friend codes aren't going away, but it's one friend code for everything.

526
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:13,512
[SPEAKER_07]: So you won't have a separate friend code.

527
00:39:13,532 --> 00:39:14,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's good.

528
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:22,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I still don't like the idea of a friend code, but I understand that they want that in there so that the rapists can't rape our children through the internet or something like that.

529
00:39:22,814 --> 00:39:23,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Hide your kids.

530
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:24,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Hide your wife.

531
00:39:27,352 --> 00:39:32,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I still don't get why you can't just have a name instead of a 16-digit randomized code.

532
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:43,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a step in the right direction, but when Nintendo is already three steps behind when it comes to online play, that news kind of just makes me go, whatever, Nintendo, whatever.

533
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:55,691
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a good thing you figured the 3D thing out because I don't know otherwise but that is I guess whatever at least you only have the one friend code despite the fact that it'll not really be something customizable it is supposed to show you what your friends are playing though

534
00:39:56,758 --> 00:39:57,779
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like a little better.

535
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:03,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and there's apparently an app in it that will show you what the status is of your friends at any time.

536
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:05,705
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see what they're playing or what have you.

537
00:40:05,745 --> 00:40:09,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So a little more like you're familiar with Xbox Live, even though it's in an app.

538
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:10,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

539
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:12,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the other thing, though, that is kind of cool.

540
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be fair, I should say this when it comes to friend codes.

541
00:40:15,492 --> 00:40:24,118
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are connected to another friend local on the local wireless, you can push a button to accept or send a friend request, and you won't ever have to exchange a number.

542
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:26,100
[SPEAKER_07]: The 3DS will just automatically grab...

543
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,402
[SPEAKER_07]: and there you have it, your friends.

544
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:32,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, okay, now that's a little better.

545
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:34,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that part of it.

546
00:40:34,686 --> 00:40:42,832
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you will, and you're at a convention, you can push a button and get gang raped by friend requests.

547
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:45,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but it has to be a mutual button pressing.

548
00:40:46,995 --> 00:40:48,376
[SPEAKER_06]: What's a mutual button pressing?

549
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:51,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Meaning you both have to accept the request.

550
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:51,679
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

551
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,621
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big old friend request gang bang.

552
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:58,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, the next Penny Arcade Expo or E3, man.

553
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:03,655
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the 3DS will be out by this year's E3, so it's going to be kind of interesting to see how.

554
00:41:03,715 --> 00:41:13,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I know E3 is not so much a fan event as it is a trade-slash-journalism event, but still, there's going to be, you know how many fanboys still manage to go to E3 because there are blogs and so forth.

555
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:18,883
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there'll be plenty of that exchanging and stuff going on.

556
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:23,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if they're going to have like a booth like they did back when the DS was new where you could kind of do the download of the demos.

557
00:41:23,886 --> 00:41:23,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

558
00:41:24,668 --> 00:41:25,609
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a good idea.

559
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:26,751
[SPEAKER_07]: That used to be cool.

560
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:30,335
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I played Meteos for the first time, which is still one of my favorite DS games to this day.

561
00:41:30,714 --> 00:41:31,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Electroplankton

562
00:42:02,275 --> 00:42:06,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it was Shane or somebody.

563
00:42:06,517 --> 00:42:12,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people left their DS on and plugged in after E3 was over so they wouldn't lose the demo.

564
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people had it for up to a week after the show was over just to still play it more.

565
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:19,263
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a great puzzle game.

566
00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:25,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, another quick story about the 3DS, and this has to do with the Virtual Console.

567
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:33,899
[SPEAKER_07]: They did confirm, I mean, we kind of already knew this, but just a confirmation, Game Boy and Game Boy Color games will be coming to the Virtual Console.

568
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:40,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario Land is the first confirmed, which, by the way, blows compared to other Mario games.

569
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,921
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't even play like other Mario games.

570
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:46,342
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have a fireball, you have this random ball that bounces off walls.

571
00:42:47,242 --> 00:42:48,583
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like this Egyptian theme.

572
00:42:48,823 --> 00:42:50,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it was supposed to be Mario game at first.

573
00:42:50,885 --> 00:42:51,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was supposed to be something else.

574
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:52,886
[SPEAKER_07]: But whatever.

575
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:54,287
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Mr. Do.

576
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:57,549
[SPEAKER_07]: No, well, okay, yeah, the weapon is.

577
00:42:57,609 --> 00:42:59,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the gameplay is still like a Mario game, but whatever.

578
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:02,532
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, Super Mario Land is confirmed.

579
00:43:03,653 --> 00:43:08,937
[SPEAKER_07]: No word about advanced games, because keep in mind there's no longer an advanced slot on these things.

580
00:43:09,457 --> 00:43:13,500
[SPEAKER_07]: So no word yet if that's coming in the future or what.

581
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,061
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

582
00:43:16,857 --> 00:43:18,358
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

583
00:43:18,658 --> 00:43:20,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe something not about the 3DS?

584
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no.

585
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:30,066
[SPEAKER_02]: This actually has to do with... Well, it has something to do with Nintendo, but not specifically Nintendo's side.

586
00:43:31,227 --> 00:43:37,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Yoshinori Ono, who is the producer of Street Fighter 4, said he wants to make Nintendo vs. Capcom.

587
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:51,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he's, uh, quoted as saying that he wants to, uh, pitch it to, um, Masahiro Sakurai, who is the, uh, um, creator of Super Smash Bros.

588
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,781
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think that that would actually be kind of cool.

589
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:58,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're already doing Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and then we have, uh, Tekken and Street Fighter.

590
00:43:59,185 --> 00:44:00,626
[SPEAKER_02]: So, who knows?

591
00:44:01,647 --> 00:44:05,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to have Jigglypuff farting on Blanca or something?

592
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:05,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

593
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,291
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be really odd.

594
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they would ever do it.

595
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:12,312
[SPEAKER_07]: It would kind of be a dopey game, but I don't know.

596
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:14,853
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of dopey games out there.

597
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:17,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't necessarily mean that in a bad way.

598
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:24,437
[SPEAKER_02]: If something's going to work with Nintendo, it's going to have to be like... I think Namco would do it.

599
00:44:24,657 --> 00:44:29,399
[SPEAKER_02]: All the Tekken games had weird characters like Gon and Yoda.

600
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:31,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't you just

601
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that'll be the most that you see come of this.

602
00:45:03,182 --> 00:45:08,948
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think in a full Marvel vs. Capcom or even Tatsunoko vs. Capcom kind of way.

603
00:45:08,988 --> 00:45:10,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they do all the cutesy characters.

604
00:45:11,631 --> 00:45:13,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe all the cutesy Capcom characters could do it.

605
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:15,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Cutesy Capcom battle!

606
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:15,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Wee!

607
00:45:15,655 --> 00:45:19,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Tatsunoko vs. Capcom would be awesome with like a Mario character or something like that.

608
00:45:19,757 --> 00:45:22,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I could see them doing maybe like Link or something.

609
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they ported Marvel vs. Capcom 3 or something to the Wii or something.

610
00:45:27,282 --> 00:45:29,703
[SPEAKER_06]: They could add Link in there and just like Soul Calibur.

611
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:31,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that maybe, maybe, maybe.

612
00:45:32,165 --> 00:45:34,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Super Chibi 3D Capcom Fighter.

613
00:45:35,747 --> 00:45:37,027
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be the game that comes of it.

614
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:39,269
[SPEAKER_14]: You know Capcom did Pakato Fighter.

615
00:45:40,169 --> 00:45:41,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, so it's been done.

616
00:45:42,494 --> 00:45:59,314
[SPEAKER_07]: anything's possible I suppose so Ed Seaton Beaver in our chatroom says I mean Capcom characters would fuck up the stupid Nintendo characters I don't know though couldn't Kirby just go and you know just kind of have his way with the Capcom characters he does suck

617
00:46:04,004 --> 00:46:04,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I don't know.

618
00:46:04,905 --> 00:46:11,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the fanboy wank begin after that story, but I don't think anything will come of it except maybe in the next Super Smash Bros.

619
00:46:11,848 --> 00:46:13,649
[SPEAKER_07]: game, which will probably be on the 3DS.

620
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:17,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and everyone will get a big ol' heart on about it.

621
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:24,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, you can play it on the Wii, friend code, across galaxies and locally, and oh my god.

622
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:25,705
[SPEAKER_07]: and Mii's.

623
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:26,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch that.

624
00:46:27,146 --> 00:46:28,927
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a Super Smash Bros.

625
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:33,129
[SPEAKER_07]: fighter thingy on the stinking DS and your Mii will be a character.

626
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:34,290
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't in the Wii version?

627
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:35,731
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have been.

628
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:36,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

629
00:46:37,512 --> 00:46:37,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not.

630
00:46:37,952 --> 00:46:39,633
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been years since I've played it at this point.

631
00:46:40,613 --> 00:46:41,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

632
00:46:41,694 --> 00:46:44,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the little adventure part of that game.

633
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:46,637
[SPEAKER_07]: The adventure stuff was cool.

634
00:46:46,657 --> 00:46:47,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you that.

635
00:46:47,297 --> 00:46:48,638
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a really cool part of the game.

636
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:51,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on with some release dates.

637
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:54,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Travel the world and see what's coming out to a console near you.

638
00:46:55,131 --> 00:46:58,473
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a lot of stuff coming out this week, but there is a couple good things.

639
00:46:58,754 --> 00:47:08,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead Space 2 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, as well as the collector's editions with the wonderful replica gun in there.

640
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:12,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Paws and Claws Marine Rescue on Nintendo DS.

641
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:20,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Two Worlds 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, as well as the Royal Edition of that.

642
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:22,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

643
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:26,674
[SPEAKER_06]: and Lord of Arcana on PSP.

644
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:29,277
[SPEAKER_06]: That, I believe, is it.

645
00:47:30,158 --> 00:47:30,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

646
00:47:30,739 --> 00:47:32,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to take a look here.

647
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, that is it.

648
00:47:33,502 --> 00:47:35,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do things a little out of order and go to UK dates?

649
00:47:35,544 --> 00:47:36,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, never mind.

650
00:47:37,866 --> 00:47:41,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, my thing wasn't loading, but it just popped up.

651
00:47:41,931 --> 00:47:42,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I blame your thing.

652
00:47:43,012 --> 00:47:43,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

653
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:44,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid thing!

654
00:47:45,294 --> 00:47:48,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Dream Club Zero and Gal Gun are both coming out very soon on the 360 over in Japan.

655
00:47:48,056 --> 00:47:48,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I hear

656
00:48:11,314 --> 00:48:11,675
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

657
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:21,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Though... Huh.

658
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:22,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

659
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:24,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't... I have to recover that account.

660
00:48:24,883 --> 00:48:25,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck with that.

661
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:31,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Dragon Age Origins gets its Japanese release.

662
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:35,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know that's a long time after we had it, but they've probably localized quite a bit for Japan.

663
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So it took a little while.

664
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:41,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Mindjack comes out, Shooting Studio, and Wizardry Twin Pack.

665
00:48:42,514 --> 00:48:45,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, is that like the old school C64 Wizardry games?

666
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:47,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a new version of it?

667
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:49,339
[SPEAKER_07]: They're RPG games.

668
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I think these might be new versions of that old school game from the 80s.

669
00:48:54,603 --> 00:49:00,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very text heavy in Japanese though, so you better be fluent in Japanese if you're going to import that.

670
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see that Zork is on good old games now?

671
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:09,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I had heard about that, but you know, I can't justify paying what they want for Zork.

672
00:49:10,874 --> 00:49:38,046
[SPEAKER_07]: you know what I mean plus I had the whole resurgence you could play Zork on GameTap like back when GameTap was cool when Turner owned it you could play the Zork games and you know I kind of got my fill of retro back then and now I'm over it on the Nintendo Wii huge week on the Wii huge gigantic monumental week on the Wii the last story comes out this week that is a huge game I would be so excited if this game would come out in the US they have said nothing about it yet

673
00:49:38,274 --> 00:49:38,754
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

674
00:50:02,023 --> 00:50:04,384
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they going to talk about on the Wii at E3 this year?

675
00:50:04,804 --> 00:50:06,104
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing to talk about.

676
00:50:06,724 --> 00:50:20,608
[SPEAKER_07]: At least this would be something to hold people over because, again, if you don't know what this game is and why I'm so excited about it, it's a Mistwalker RPG on the Wii and the graphics actually look pretty phenomenal compared to the 360 and PS3 considering the Wii's

677
00:50:20,908 --> 00:50:21,228
[SPEAKER_07]: MissedWalker

678
00:50:37,446 --> 00:50:54,919
[SPEAKER_07]: but nothing about when it's coming out over here if ever besides that coilo comment that Loki already referenced just to like kind of put this in perspective when you look at like Japanese releases for February there are four games actually three because one of them is a collector's pack

679
00:50:55,279 --> 00:50:56,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Three games coming out in February.

680
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is, right here.

681
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo of France.

682
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:02,743
[SPEAKER_06]: It says they have no plans to localize the last story.

683
00:51:03,723 --> 00:51:06,144
[SPEAKER_06]: It says... Let's see here.

684
00:51:06,365 --> 00:51:07,085
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just fucking France.

685
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,346
[SPEAKER_06]: No plans at the moment.

686
00:51:08,786 --> 00:51:10,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't listen to the guy from France.

687
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:14,589
[SPEAKER_06]: It says the adaptation of this game could be very long.

688
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:14,909
[SPEAKER_06]: 12,000 dialogues.

689
00:51:14,929 --> 00:51:16,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it says it has 12,000 dialogues.

690
00:51:19,835 --> 00:51:21,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen up, Nintendo of France.

691
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:26,400
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to surrender to the idea of having last story.

692
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,443
[SPEAKER_06]: And their translation teams are overstretched in the short term.

693
00:51:30,483 --> 00:51:31,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing what?

694
00:51:32,064 --> 00:51:33,225
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you what's going to happen.

695
00:51:33,786 --> 00:51:34,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Hackers will do this.

696
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:37,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Hackers will.

697
00:51:37,048 --> 00:51:38,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Hackers going to hack.

698
00:51:38,189 --> 00:51:38,830
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what he's saying.

699
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:39,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Hackers are going to translate this.

700
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:40,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Hackers are going to hack.

701
00:51:41,452 --> 00:51:42,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it will happen.

702
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:43,733
[SPEAKER_06]: It will get released.

703
00:51:44,314 --> 00:51:47,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will piss people off.

704
00:51:47,817 --> 00:51:48,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

705
00:51:49,057 --> 00:51:50,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't trust some guy.

706
00:51:50,278 --> 00:51:54,779
[SPEAKER_07]: If Reggie Fils-Aimé had come out and said it's not happening, then I'd believe it.

707
00:51:55,059 --> 00:52:01,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Some random executive with Nintendo of France says it and we're all supposed to accept that as the final word, I don't think so.

708
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:02,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I say no.

709
00:52:03,341 --> 00:52:04,061
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

710
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:07,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they followed it up with, I fought in your general direction.

711
00:52:08,402 --> 00:52:08,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop.

712
00:52:11,451 --> 00:52:12,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on to the DS.

713
00:52:14,193 --> 00:52:19,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, not a lot going on in the DS either, but this is a little more understandable, of course, because we have three DS on the horizon in February.

714
00:52:19,938 --> 00:52:28,464
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are a couple puzzle games and then a game called Sora no Otoshimono Forte Dreamy Season in regular and deluxe editions.

715
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:34,349
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an adventure game that's coming out with three chibi little cartoony babes on the cover.

716
00:52:34,469 --> 00:52:39,653
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it might be some type of card game, but I do want to point out that this chick is not wearing pants in the screenshot.

717
00:52:39,893 --> 00:52:41,234
[SPEAKER_15]: She's wearing gym uniform.

718
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:51,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, it looks like she's not wearing pants to me She's not wearing pants, she's wearing shorts Fine They're bloomers They're very short shorts They're bloomers

719
00:52:51,912 --> 00:52:53,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they have to be agile.

720
00:52:53,933 --> 00:53:08,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Lastly, on the PS3, I'm sorry, PSP, Toaru Majutsu no Kinsho Mokuroku comes out from ASCII this week, which that game, it's a futuristic world with magic powers.

721
00:53:08,941 --> 00:53:09,761
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fighting game.

722
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:12,543
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like Dissida, but just with general characters.

723
00:53:12,963 --> 00:53:14,524
[SPEAKER_07]: But this game might catch people's attention.

724
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:17,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Valkyria Chronicles 3 Unrecorded Chronicles.

725
00:53:17,785 --> 00:53:20,587
[SPEAKER_07]: That comes out on PSP this week, so I'm sure that'll have its fans.

726
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:22,208
[SPEAKER_07]: and importers.

727
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:24,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now we can go to the UK, DarkSakura.

728
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:24,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

729
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:25,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

730
00:53:26,151 --> 00:53:30,113
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 25th, we have Dead Space for the iPhone, sorry.

731
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:39,360
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 28th, though, we have Dead Space 2 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360 and Mario Sports Mix and Yogi Bear the video game.

732
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:44,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen the alternate ending, quote unquote, on YouTube?

733
00:53:44,423 --> 00:53:44,623
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

734
00:53:44,643 --> 00:53:46,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Where Boo Boo shoots Yogi Bear?

735
00:53:46,465 --> 00:53:46,505
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

736
00:53:46,665 --> 00:53:46,845
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

737
00:53:48,556 --> 00:53:50,057
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the alternate ending to the movie.

738
00:53:51,778 --> 00:53:52,398
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

739
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:55,500
[SPEAKER_06]: That would mean you'd have to go see the movie, right?

740
00:53:57,281 --> 00:53:58,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would hate to see that movie.

741
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,503
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you don't.

742
00:54:00,543 --> 00:54:01,704
[SPEAKER_07]: You just look it up on YouTube.

743
00:54:02,084 --> 00:54:07,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but I don't want to even try to pretend to see that movie or part of the movie.

744
00:54:08,468 --> 00:54:09,188
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't understand.

745
00:54:09,248 --> 00:54:09,709
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

746
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:10,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, hold on.

747
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:10,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

748
00:54:10,589 --> 00:54:10,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

749
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:11,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

750
00:54:15,618 --> 00:54:17,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all the sad music and everything.

751
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:22,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And Yogi Bear sees the little wanted ad for himself or whatever up on the wall.

752
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:27,342
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Boo Boo looking all sad and pointing the gun.

753
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:30,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

754
00:54:32,684 --> 00:54:33,785
[SPEAKER_07]: All this sad music.

755
00:54:33,865 --> 00:54:34,225
[SPEAKER_07]: God.

756
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,067
[SPEAKER_07]: This, by the way, I started it like a minute and a half into it.

757
00:54:39,627 --> 00:54:39,887
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

758
00:54:44,008 --> 00:54:44,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

759
00:54:44,508 --> 00:54:45,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, seriously, who did that?

760
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:50,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because that's... I know, it looks... Some people say it might be a viral thing for the movie.

761
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:54,093
[SPEAKER_07]: That they're saying it's independent, but it was actually like a viral thing.

762
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's the bear skin rug at the very end.

763
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,075
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of wrong.

764
00:54:59,415 --> 00:55:02,177
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura's rolling her eyes so far.

765
00:55:04,788 --> 00:55:16,064
[SPEAKER_06]: See now, if that movie had that kind of humor, like it was an adult movie with violence and titties How do you have titties in a Yogi Bear movie?

766
00:55:16,084 --> 00:55:16,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

767
00:55:17,946 --> 00:55:22,031
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you had violence and titties in there, that might be a cool movie

768
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't see that.

769
00:55:25,692 --> 00:55:28,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember titties being in the old cartoon.

770
00:55:28,454 --> 00:55:29,354
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

771
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:29,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

772
00:55:30,255 --> 00:55:32,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember the cartoon being raped across.

773
00:55:32,737 --> 00:55:36,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was now, but I don't remember it being terrible like this.

774
00:55:38,621 --> 00:55:40,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, the chat room is asking for a link.

775
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:42,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to get one for you guys right now.

776
00:55:42,663 --> 00:55:44,044
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's get back.

777
00:55:44,064 --> 00:55:45,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we finish UK dates?

778
00:55:45,045 --> 00:55:45,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

779
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:46,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's it.

780
00:55:46,366 --> 00:55:47,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get back into some news, Loki.

781
00:55:48,206 --> 00:55:52,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Just don't understand why we can't have violence and titties in Yogi Bear.

782
00:55:52,398 --> 00:55:54,404
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense.

783
00:55:55,487 --> 00:55:56,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about it.

784
00:55:57,507 --> 00:56:06,270
[SPEAKER_06]: There was an Xbox 360 dashboard update this week, which pissed me off because that delayed me from playing my Grand Theft Auto game for a good half an hour.

785
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:08,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Because our internet's really slow.

786
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:12,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first thing I was worrying about is, is console amusing going to get banned?

787
00:56:12,571 --> 00:56:15,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's flashed and not hot swapped like the rest of them.

788
00:56:15,512 --> 00:56:16,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I got lazy.

789
00:56:16,993 --> 00:56:17,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways...

790
00:56:19,384 --> 00:56:20,685
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, that wasn't the case.

791
00:56:20,786 --> 00:56:30,815
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually a small update to restore, I guess, the planned launch or whatever.

792
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:37,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically the option where you can have the disk in the drive and when you start the system up it will actually play the game instead of going to the dashboard.

793
00:56:38,703 --> 00:56:42,687
[SPEAKER_06]: It was something I guess that broke in the last dashboard update.

794
00:56:43,027 --> 00:56:57,831
[SPEAKER_06]: and they will have a second update later this week because I guess they just didn't have time to finish the update to darken, I guess, your gamertag pictures or whatever it's going to be.

795
00:56:58,611 --> 00:57:01,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of it being on green or something, now it's on dark gray.

796
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:03,299
[SPEAKER_06]: which is stupid.

797
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:04,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and the other thing... Let it change.

798
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:05,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

799
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:17,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing is it also broke the ability to play backups of Call of Duty Black Ops, Mario Warfare 2, and of course, Halo Reach.

800
00:57:18,006 --> 00:57:19,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Also known as the real reason.

801
00:57:20,387 --> 00:57:21,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the real reason.

802
00:57:22,228 --> 00:57:25,769
[SPEAKER_06]: What it did was it added the... What was it?

803
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,790
[SPEAKER_06]: The API 2.5 checks.

804
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what they're calling it.

805
00:57:31,372 --> 00:57:31,952
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a new...

806
00:57:34,013 --> 00:57:41,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess an authenticity check that they've been adding to some new games to make sure they're not backed up.

807
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:53,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And if, for example, you're playing one of these games and it happens to be backed up, your console gets flagged for banning on the next... We ban you!

808
00:57:53,649 --> 00:57:54,509
[SPEAKER_06]: ...on the next go-around.

809
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:56,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately...

810
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:27,775
[SPEAKER_06]: it doesn't always well they have the new light touch firmwares for the DVD drives already this is back when the first dashboard updates came out or actually the new checks and stuff came out and they've already patched it out on these drives assuming you have your drive up to date modded and stuff and there's some drives that actually don't support this at all so it doesn't matter you can patch it all you want but they can still play backups all they want and there's no way for them to check

811
00:58:28,691 --> 00:58:29,472
[SPEAKER_06]: So that really sucks.

812
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:35,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and there's ways also to patch your games so that you're not checked by this too.

813
00:58:36,696 --> 00:58:39,999
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least you'll get a good chunk of the people that are playing that.

814
00:58:40,759 --> 00:58:48,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, on the other hand, I'm safe for now because I'm not playing Black Ops or Modern Warfare 2 or Halo Reach.

815
00:58:48,644 --> 00:58:52,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, I don't think they're going to be checking episodes of Liberty City.

816
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:57,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, I am playing a legit copy of episodes from Liberty City, but my drive is flashed.

817
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,031
[SPEAKER_06]: in one of my consoles.

818
00:58:59,131 --> 00:58:59,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Naughty, naughty.

819
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:01,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for testing.

820
00:59:02,192 --> 00:59:02,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

821
00:59:02,592 --> 00:59:03,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Because my JTAG's broken.

822
00:59:03,853 --> 00:59:05,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to test it on that right now.

823
00:59:06,214 --> 00:59:08,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm looking at our chatroom for some comments.

824
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:11,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, everybody's lit up about the adult Yogi Bear movie.

825
00:59:11,636 --> 00:59:15,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And Salacious Pop is practically writing the movie right now in some of the chatroom comments.

826
00:59:16,298 --> 00:59:16,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, boo-boo.

827
00:59:17,759 --> 00:59:19,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't Bogart all the coke, boo-boo.

828
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you, Yogi.

829
00:59:22,021 --> 00:59:24,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, no bears allowed in the strip club, violent mauling.

830
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,660
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you do to my car?

831
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know that saying about bears only shitting in woods?

832
00:59:29,641 --> 00:59:30,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It's wrong.

833
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:31,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Puts on aviator shades.

834
00:59:31,661 --> 00:59:32,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

835
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:37,023
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be awesome.

836
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:41,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in her chatroom says, Boo Boo has a right to bear arms.

837
00:59:41,564 --> 00:59:41,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

838
00:59:45,425 --> 00:59:45,865
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

839
00:59:45,885 --> 00:59:46,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

840
00:59:52,992 --> 00:59:59,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Ladies and gentlemen, it took 398 weeks, but this show has officially driven DarkSakura to the brink of sanity.

841
01:00:00,647 --> 01:00:01,408
[SPEAKER_07]: To madness.

842
01:00:01,949 --> 01:00:03,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I had sanity, ever.

843
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:05,216
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

844
01:00:06,556 --> 01:00:08,258
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving on.

845
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:11,481
[SPEAKER_07]: One other quick story for you guys, and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

846
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:13,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it back to the old school way.

847
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,185
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll kick it back 14 years right now.

848
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:19,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when they originally announced Duke Nukem Forever?

849
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:21,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh boy, yes, that's right.

850
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:26,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Duke Nukem Forever was that game that was announced before some of you were probably born.

851
01:00:27,395 --> 01:00:32,676
[SPEAKER_07]: This game was supposed to come out, and now it finally has a release date.

852
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:35,557
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, it was published in the latest Game Informer magazine.

853
01:00:36,057 --> 01:00:42,279
[SPEAKER_07]: May 3rd, 2011, or 2011, whatever you want to say, is the new release date for Duke Nukem Forever.

854
01:00:42,819 --> 01:00:45,039
[SPEAKER_07]: That is what Gearbox Software is aiming for.

855
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,460
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, of course, obviously, they're really hyping up this release now.

856
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,561
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the game that was never going to happen.

857
01:00:52,367 --> 01:00:56,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, guys, once this game kind of changed hands, it's happened pretty quickly.

858
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:02,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's not surprising that really all it took was getting it away from 3D Realms and giving it to someone else.

859
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:06,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, I mean, I don't mean to disrespect 3D Realms, but damn.

860
01:01:06,657 --> 01:01:07,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the trailer?

861
01:01:07,437 --> 01:01:08,338
[SPEAKER_07]: You never did anything.

862
01:01:08,438 --> 01:01:09,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you see the trailer?

863
01:01:09,258 --> 01:01:10,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I didn't see the full trailer.

864
01:01:10,839 --> 01:01:11,440
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny.

865
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,081
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well, let me take a look here.

866
01:01:13,201 --> 01:01:14,902
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, when's your birthday?

867
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:15,763
[SPEAKER_07]: When's your birthday?

868
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:19,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say I was born in 1931 because that's where my mouse clicked first.

869
01:01:20,186 --> 01:01:20,626
[SPEAKER_07]: February 1st, 1931.

870
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:20,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

871
01:01:22,768 --> 01:01:23,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh and white.

872
01:01:23,748 --> 01:01:25,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Try mine.

873
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't show me these goddamn ads.

874
01:01:27,052 --> 01:01:28,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go to Kotaku.

875
01:01:28,633 --> 01:01:29,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

876
01:01:29,994 --> 01:01:32,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

877
01:01:33,518 --> 01:01:35,079
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna be done in a second anyway.

878
01:01:38,702 --> 01:01:39,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we go.

879
01:01:41,745 --> 01:01:43,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Rated M. Of course.

880
01:01:48,755 --> 01:01:54,481
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to tell stories of a man who saved the world.

881
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:58,545
[SPEAKER_03]: A man whose very presence sent aliens running back to their motherships.

882
01:01:59,787 --> 01:02:02,489
[SPEAKER_03]: A man who disappeared without a trace.

883
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:07,595
[SPEAKER_03]: When the invaders came back, they came back angry.

884
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:16,193
[SPEAKER_03]: They tore our planet apart, bit by bit.

885
01:02:17,173 --> 01:02:19,093
[SPEAKER_03]: But they made one mistake.

886
01:02:20,854 --> 01:02:22,774
[SPEAKER_03]: They shouldn't have gone after our women.

887
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:24,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.

888
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:28,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do they always take the hot ones?

889
01:02:28,515 --> 01:02:29,175
[SPEAKER_13]: You want it.

890
01:02:30,156 --> 01:02:30,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

891
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:33,716
[SPEAKER_13]: The captions are the best part.

892
01:02:35,057 --> 01:02:36,077
[SPEAKER_13]: You need it.

893
01:02:38,917 --> 01:02:40,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he just punch that alien in the face?

894
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:40,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

895
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:41,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

896
01:02:45,402 --> 01:02:53,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And now... We're fucking bringing it!

897
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:57,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

898
01:02:58,046 --> 01:02:58,386
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

899
01:03:02,467 --> 01:03:04,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you think I was gone forever?

900
01:03:08,936 --> 01:03:10,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they get the original voice actor?

901
01:03:10,297 --> 01:03:12,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like it.

902
01:03:12,858 --> 01:03:16,379
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a big giant alien with three boobs.

903
01:03:25,644 --> 01:03:27,244
[SPEAKER_07]: He's peeing.

904
01:03:27,484 --> 01:03:28,105
[SPEAKER_07]: That's lovely.

905
01:03:29,545 --> 01:03:30,146
[SPEAKER_07]: That's nice.

906
01:03:31,306 --> 01:03:32,987
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going on for way too long in this trailer.

907
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:34,908
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be done soon.

908
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:36,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

909
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:40,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, a lot of gum.

910
01:03:40,499 --> 01:03:41,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

911
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the vehicle drive.

912
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's cool.

913
01:03:43,081 --> 01:03:47,523
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be good, because this guy just did Borderlands.

914
01:03:47,543 --> 01:03:47,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

915
01:03:58,566 --> 01:03:59,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Coochie, coochie.

916
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:04,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Hail to the king, baby.

917
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,830
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the game, Duke?

918
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it any good?

919
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:10,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but after 12 years, it should be.

920
01:04:13,033 --> 01:04:13,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

921
01:04:13,734 --> 01:04:14,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cute.

922
01:04:14,634 --> 01:04:17,976
[SPEAKER_07]: The minute I heard it was going to the guys in Borderlands, I was like, okay, it's in capable hands.

923
01:04:18,936 --> 01:04:45,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious to see how the game plays like a first level walkthrough type of video or something which I'm sure probably exists out there from the Penny Arcade Expo where they brought it but yeah it looks like it's keeping that same sense of humor and definitely not holding back on the tits and ass that's nice to see I remember reading that everything that's in the that's blurred out or bleeped out is actually going to be in the game so nice

924
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:47,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

925
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:51,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, our chat room is oversharing as they're watching this trailer here with us.

926
01:04:52,368 --> 01:04:55,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Ed Seaton Beaver in our chat room says, I am touching myself to the trailer.

927
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:00,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Defective Candy says, I have quite literally been waiting for this game my whole life.

928
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:06,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Bonds006 says, punching it in the face never gets old.

929
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:07,526
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

930
01:05:08,547 --> 01:05:09,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it punching E.T.?

931
01:05:09,647 --> 01:05:11,227
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Scott Pilgrim.

932
01:05:11,387 --> 01:05:13,188
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Prodigy, okay?

933
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:15,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Prodigy.

934
01:05:15,989 --> 01:05:17,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Scott Pilgrim.

935
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:20,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was in that trailer, but it's the Prodigy.

936
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:24,231
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a cage match pick that won a couple times.

937
01:05:24,511 --> 01:05:24,791
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

938
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:26,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get into the classic game of the week.

939
01:05:26,773 --> 01:05:29,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough about this stuff that you had to wait 14 years for.

940
01:05:29,755 --> 01:05:31,657
[SPEAKER_07]: How about something that was out 14 years ago?

941
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:32,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's 12 years.

942
01:05:32,698 --> 01:05:33,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

943
01:05:33,038 --> 01:05:33,859
[SPEAKER_06]: He said 12 years.

944
01:05:33,939 --> 01:05:35,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going by Duke.

945
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:35,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

946
01:05:35,901 --> 01:05:36,441
[SPEAKER_07]: How about we say 13?

947
01:05:38,883 --> 01:05:39,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

948
01:05:39,384 --> 01:05:41,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week.

949
01:05:43,788 --> 01:05:44,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

950
01:05:44,468 --> 01:05:46,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Excite me with a classic game.

951
01:05:47,051 --> 01:05:49,273
[SPEAKER_02]: The classic game of the week is Power Stone 2.

952
01:05:50,194 --> 01:05:51,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically Power Stone 2.

953
01:05:52,585 --> 01:05:58,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Power Stone was great, but Power Stone 2 made all kinds of fun improvements over the first one.

954
01:05:59,148 --> 01:06:04,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, it's got all of the characters from the first Power Stone, and it's basically a four-player fighting game.

955
01:06:05,511 --> 01:06:05,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

956
01:06:07,472 --> 01:06:08,453
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so much fun.

957
01:06:09,033 --> 01:06:10,614
[SPEAKER_02]: You have all kinds of different gameplay.

958
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,816
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the one-on-one, which is like the original.

959
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,257
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a two-character storyline game.

960
01:06:16,677 --> 01:06:21,880
[SPEAKER_02]: You have arcade mode, which is a four-character storyline game, and two characters advance per round.

961
01:06:22,221 --> 01:06:26,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have original, which is multiplayer, so you can pick stages and everything.

962
01:06:26,443 --> 01:06:27,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun party game.

963
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:33,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And then adventure that has an unpredictable storyline, and you can collect cards, items, and money.

964
01:06:34,443 --> 01:06:37,424
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's got five different stages and the boss stages.

965
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And all kinds of different fun stuff.

966
01:06:40,645 --> 01:06:43,146
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the desert stage that has the Pharaoh Walker.

967
01:06:45,027 --> 01:06:46,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And all kinds of neat things.

968
01:06:46,707 --> 01:06:50,669
[SPEAKER_02]: It even had secret characters like Pride Falcon and Mel.

969
01:06:51,489 --> 01:06:55,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the PSP version you also get Kraken and Valgus back from the first game.

970
01:06:55,731 --> 01:06:56,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty cool.

971
01:06:56,811 --> 01:06:58,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Jack.

972
01:06:59,172 --> 01:06:59,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack was cool.

973
01:07:00,512 --> 01:07:00,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Although...

974
01:07:02,874 --> 01:07:09,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for Dan he was always using Fokker, or as they had him in the US one, Falcon.

975
01:07:10,161 --> 01:07:12,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, because Fokker's like Roy Fokker from Macross.

976
01:07:13,004 --> 01:07:14,005
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he always said.

977
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:15,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Or he's a real mother Fokker.

978
01:07:17,288 --> 01:07:18,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I would always use Ayame.

979
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:19,370
[SPEAKER_02]: That was me.

980
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:21,732
[SPEAKER_02]: www.DarkSakura.com

981
01:07:40,527 --> 01:07:46,651
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get different items like flamethrowers and giant hammers and bear traps and a magazine.

982
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:52,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you get food and invisibility and wings and all kinds of fun stuff.

983
01:07:53,094 --> 01:07:56,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can, you know, drop bombs and icebergs at people.

984
01:07:57,036 --> 01:07:58,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So, really cool.

985
01:07:58,717 --> 01:08:02,519
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got, like, the bad guys with, like I said, Pharaoh Walker and Dr. Erode.

986
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Dr. Erode is cool.

987
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:08,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has a Power Stone of his own.

988
01:08:09,073 --> 01:08:09,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

989
01:08:27,181 --> 01:08:45,029
[SPEAKER_02]: and actually the secret character Mel ran the item shop and with the VMU it had this thing called the mini book that you can look at your players item inventory you can trade items with other players and you can register things in your inventory as handy items that appear in original mode so they give you this advantage

990
01:08:45,729 --> 01:09:02,542
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you put the disc in a CD player then it plays the same message well, it plays the same message that was used on the Dreamcast one except there's piano music with it and that's Power Stone 2 awesome Dreamcast

991
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:03,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

992
01:09:25,939 --> 01:09:26,860
[SPEAKER_02]: with eight players.

993
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:28,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

994
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,543
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Power Stone 2.

995
01:09:31,983 --> 01:09:32,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Good choice, DarkSakura.

996
01:09:33,224 --> 01:09:33,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good choice.

997
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:35,985
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're going to go to a break, guys.

998
01:09:36,065 --> 01:09:37,366
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that time of the show where we take a break.

999
01:09:37,446 --> 01:09:38,067
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back, though.

1000
01:09:38,087 --> 01:09:39,567
[SPEAKER_07]: There's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1001
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:43,350
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't even talked about some of the things that were announced at the Square Enix event this week, which we're going to get into.

1002
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:46,072
[SPEAKER_07]: A little more news about Duke Nukem Forever, believe it or not.

1003
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,514
[SPEAKER_07]: A story about the Rock Band Network and some things going on with Apple.

1004
01:09:49,774 --> 01:09:50,975
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have to talk about...

1005
01:09:51,815 --> 01:09:53,416
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on with the PlayStation hack case?

1006
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:54,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's more developments.

1007
01:09:54,317 --> 01:09:57,239
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get into all that, plus a story involving boobs.

1008
01:09:57,379 --> 01:09:59,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not even a Yogi Bear related thing.

1009
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,882
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got all that after the break.

1010
01:10:00,962 --> 01:10:07,647
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be right back with your Twitter topics, emails, or lack thereof, and more in just a little bit here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1011
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1012
01:10:16,031 --> 01:10:24,055
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live on this Sunday, January 23rd of 2011 for the 398th episode of our little program.

1013
01:10:24,695 --> 01:10:26,116
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've got plenty more news coming up.

1014
01:10:26,336 --> 01:10:30,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Some rapid fire news in just a moment, but we quickly want to give some plugs for some other shows that we work on.

1015
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:33,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week, DarkSakura has a show that she does.

1016
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:34,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1017
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:35,120
[SPEAKER_07]: With her buddies.

1018
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Comic Insanity.

1019
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:38,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can find it on Infamous.net.

1020
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:40,202
[SPEAKER_02]: That's N-F-A-M-O-U-S.

1021
01:10:40,382 --> 01:10:42,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a Twitter for Comic Insanity as well.

1022
01:10:42,952 --> 01:10:43,933
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1023
01:10:59,313 --> 01:10:59,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Check those out.

1024
01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:01,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Both available on iTunes.

1025
01:11:01,455 --> 01:11:05,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Comic Insanity, that's the letter N, no I in front, and Horde House.

1026
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:09,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find those both on iTunes or whatever podcasting directory it is that you use.

1027
01:11:10,324 --> 01:11:11,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into some rapid fire news.

1028
01:11:11,665 --> 01:11:12,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the Twitter topics.

1029
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,348
[SPEAKER_07]: You got just a couple minutes to lock those in.

1030
01:11:14,368 --> 01:11:17,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter.com slash OLR for the Twitter topics.

1031
01:11:17,811 --> 01:11:18,572
[SPEAKER_07]: First, some quick news.

1032
01:11:19,099 --> 01:11:28,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there's a rumor that an official software development kit for Windows is coming before the Kinect.

1033
01:11:28,823 --> 01:11:31,724
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're saying it could actually be coming within the next few months.

1034
01:11:32,404 --> 01:11:37,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, if you think about it, would time just perfectly with Game Developer Conference.

1035
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:41,148
[SPEAKER_06]: And wouldn't that be something that they would probably want at Game Developer Conference?

1036
01:11:42,008 --> 01:11:42,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

1037
01:11:42,408 --> 01:11:42,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe?

1038
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:43,469
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit?

1039
01:11:43,609 --> 01:11:44,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Good theory.

1040
01:11:44,729 --> 01:12:04,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, apparently, this is coming from a website WinRumors, sources are familiar with the plans, and that official software development kit and Kinect drivers are being prepped for a beta release in the coming months.

1041
01:12:04,509 --> 01:12:10,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Potentially arriving with the upcoming XNA update dubbed Community Technical Preview.

1042
01:12:10,856 --> 01:12:24,731
[SPEAKER_06]: In the report, I guess they're saying that there's statements being made by Microsoft's head, Steve Ballmer, earlier this month saying that the Kinect support would be coming to PC in a formal way in the right time.

1043
01:12:25,892 --> 01:12:29,213
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense that it would be at something like Game Developers Conference.

1044
01:12:29,853 --> 01:12:31,913
[SPEAKER_06]: My bet would be that's when it's coming out.

1045
01:12:32,213 --> 01:12:35,354
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll probably see an update to XNA and stuff like that around that time as well.

1046
01:12:38,235 --> 01:12:46,236
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good anyways because you get support for the XNA stuff, for PC stuff, and for the indie games.

1047
01:12:46,776 --> 01:12:48,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd really like to see what the indie games do with Kinect.

1048
01:12:48,757 --> 01:12:49,877
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be very interesting.

1049
01:12:52,322 --> 01:12:53,503
[SPEAKER_06]: and Scary at the same time.

1050
01:12:53,523 --> 01:12:55,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it could be very scary as well.

1051
01:12:55,945 --> 01:12:56,225
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

1052
01:12:58,426 --> 01:12:59,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1053
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:02,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Pixel 4's Halo is now free to download.

1054
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:10,175
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Halo demake by Eric Ruth, who you may remember ran into a little bit of trouble with his last...

1055
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:38,390
[SPEAKER_06]: DMake of DJ Hero but this time though it's kind of a side scroller shooter game so go check it out and you can find that on I guess bigdownload.com slash games slash pixel dash force dash halo slash pc slash pixel dash force dot halo dot dash free dash game or just go do a damn google search for it because it's probably a lot easier than writing that all down

1056
01:13:40,519 --> 01:14:08,520
[SPEAKER_06]: and last but not least, speaking of DJ Hero DJ Hero 2 has added some new trance anthems this week and you can get these for $8 or 640 Microsoft points and they are also available separately on the Wii for 300 points a pop and with that you get Foreign Angel by Paul Van Dyke mixed with 9pm Till I Come by ATB

1057
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:36,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Which even though that song I don't really consider like a trance anthem I do remember that it was on a bunch And apparently that song is remixed as well, my bad It was on a bunch of trance albums back when I was buying CDs a long time ago Not Over by Paul Oakenfold featuring Ryan Tedder And Punk by Ferry Corson versus Imagine by Armin Van Buren Sounds cool

1058
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:39,535
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1059
01:14:59,973 --> 01:15:00,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1060
01:15:00,133 --> 01:15:00,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1061
01:15:00,233 --> 01:15:00,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1062
01:15:20,918 --> 01:15:33,530
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be a number of RPG elements in this, meaning there'll be different job classes, there'll be PvP, you can party up with other players, and of course, hack hack slash slash and all the button mashing you are used to from the originals.

1063
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:37,653
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be a free-to-play game, so that's pretty cool.

1064
01:15:37,874 --> 01:15:40,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Microtransactions, of course, that's how these things work these days.

1065
01:15:41,517 --> 01:15:46,041
[SPEAKER_07]: No word on when this game will announce in North America, if at all possible.

1066
01:15:46,261 --> 01:15:48,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, this is going to be another country's first.

1067
01:15:49,783 --> 01:15:50,183
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1068
01:15:51,903 --> 01:15:52,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal 2.

1069
01:15:53,364 --> 01:15:54,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Big news on Portal 2 this week.

1070
01:15:55,165 --> 01:16:01,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal 2 has announced that when it comes to the PS3, it's going to have cross-platform chat between the PS3 and the PC.

1071
01:16:02,228 --> 01:16:03,969
[SPEAKER_07]: That includes multiplayer as well.

1072
01:16:04,369 --> 01:16:06,410
[SPEAKER_07]: And, get this, you buy the game on the PS3...

1073
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:31,264
[SPEAKER_07]: you're going to get the Steam version for free if you link your PSN and your Steam accounts you will get the Steam Play version of Portal 2 free because you have the PS3 game so boy did they just sell many more copies of the PlayStation 3 version of this game at least versus the Xbox 360 which is really what Sony wanted at their conference I'm sure when they came out and announced this whole new friendship they now have with Valve

1074
01:16:31,804 --> 01:16:59,397
[SPEAKER_07]: so they are also saying with this a quote from Gabe Newell from Valve quote we hope to expand upon the foundation being laid in Portal 2 with more Steam features and functionality in DLC and future content releases could be very interesting for the future these two companies working together by the way cloud based storage will also be working on the PS3 which I think they had announced before but it's kind of interesting to see how that's all going to work with the PC integration as well

1075
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:03,121
[SPEAKER_07]: One other quick story here, and I mean quick.

1076
01:17:04,882 --> 01:17:06,864
[SPEAKER_07]: You know there's a new Justin Bieber movie coming out?

1077
01:17:06,884 --> 01:17:08,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know, right?

1078
01:17:08,846 --> 01:17:12,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Think of how I felt when I had to see that trailer before I went and saw Tangled.

1079
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:15,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?

1080
01:17:15,472 --> 01:17:20,676
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta give Nintendo props, because they wanted to use a 15-second clip of the Super Mario Bros.

1081
01:17:20,716 --> 01:17:24,439
[SPEAKER_07]: theme song in the new Justin Bieber movie, and Nintendo said no.

1082
01:17:26,519 --> 01:17:27,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo said no.

1083
01:17:28,482 --> 01:17:30,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Because cereal's more important.

1084
01:17:30,765 --> 01:17:36,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, funny enough, I remember back in the day there was Nintendo underwear you could order from the magazine.

1085
01:17:36,614 --> 01:17:38,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And you think of how bad of an idea that was?

1086
01:17:39,038 --> 01:17:39,759
[SPEAKER_06]: This is much worse.

1087
01:17:39,859 --> 01:17:40,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.

1088
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:41,502
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like underoos.

1089
01:17:42,843 --> 01:17:55,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we may have made a failing cereal brand and we may have whored out our brands to all sorts of different merchandise out there, but no, we are drawing the line here.

1090
01:17:56,015 --> 01:17:57,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck off, Justin Bieber.

1091
01:17:59,232 --> 01:17:59,492
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

1092
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:31,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for fans of Bejeweled Blitz, it looks like Bejeweled Blitz Live is going to have a 16-player online play with Xbox Live Arcade.

1093
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:32,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

1094
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:34,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of people can play.

1095
01:18:34,392 --> 01:18:35,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be crazy, GoNuts.

1096
01:18:36,874 --> 01:18:40,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dance Dance Revolution is having download content!

1097
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:42,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1098
01:18:42,737 --> 01:18:57,123
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Greatest Hits pack that's got Paranoia, Brilliant to You, AM3P, Trip Machine, Put Your Faith in Me And there's a premium pack that's free that says Let's Get Away, Dreaming Can Make a Wish Come True, and Private Eye

1099
01:18:58,304 --> 01:19:00,265
[SPEAKER_02]: and just a whole bunch of stuff.

1100
01:19:00,305 --> 01:19:01,446
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff on here.

1101
01:19:01,466 --> 01:19:06,669
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Konomics Greatest Hits, which has a B4U Higher Burn in the Floor Hysteria Trip Machine.

1102
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:08,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.

1103
01:19:09,331 --> 01:19:11,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that these are worthy packets.

1104
01:19:12,513 --> 01:19:13,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hoorah.

1105
01:19:14,714 --> 01:19:23,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, there is video out that has two more characters for a...

1106
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:24,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

1107
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:31,445
[SPEAKER_02]: For Super Street Fighter 4, there is Evil Ryu and Oni Akuma.

1108
01:19:32,065 --> 01:19:34,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool, which I kind of saw coming anyway.

1109
01:19:36,308 --> 01:19:36,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking forward to that.

1110
01:19:36,988 --> 01:19:37,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's video out.

1111
01:19:37,929 --> 01:19:40,851
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't been officially confirmed, but dude, there's video, so whatever.

1112
01:19:41,711 --> 01:19:43,292
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got red glowing eyes.

1113
01:19:43,432 --> 01:19:44,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Evil Ryu.

1114
01:19:45,419 --> 01:19:47,501
[SPEAKER_06]: They have some better screenshots out there too.

1115
01:19:47,821 --> 01:19:49,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like that.

1116
01:19:49,843 --> 01:19:52,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's official.

1117
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:54,267
[SPEAKER_06]: As official as it gets.

1118
01:19:54,727 --> 01:20:02,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And his moves are the same ones that he had in Alpha 2 and Alpha 3, so whatever.

1119
01:20:04,536 --> 01:20:06,318
[SPEAKER_06]: See, this is what it's about.

1120
01:20:06,738 --> 01:20:07,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcade Unlocks.

1121
01:20:08,174 --> 01:20:08,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that shit.

1122
01:20:09,415 --> 01:20:11,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that shit when it was around with DDR Max 2.

1123
01:20:12,456 --> 01:20:15,838
[SPEAKER_06]: It got people, got asses in the seats, as they would say.

1124
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:17,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Got people to the arcade.

1125
01:20:18,199 --> 01:20:19,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fans of DDR.

1126
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure people that play Street Fighter don't give a shit about DDR.

1127
01:20:24,542 --> 01:20:26,503
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what they need to do.

1128
01:20:26,723 --> 01:20:28,344
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty badass.

1129
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we ready to get to the tweets?

1130
01:20:32,126 --> 01:20:33,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like actually they're just calling him Oni.

1131
01:20:34,367 --> 01:20:35,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take that as a no.

1132
01:20:36,741 --> 01:20:39,605
[SPEAKER_02]: which kind of makes sense because anyway.

1133
01:20:39,926 --> 01:20:40,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we have tweets.

1134
01:20:42,089 --> 01:20:42,450
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know.

1135
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:46,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when Oni Mode and DDR was a big deal and everybody was like, what does Oni mean?

1136
01:20:46,596 --> 01:20:47,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Oni means ogre.

1137
01:20:47,777 --> 01:20:48,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, ogre.

1138
01:20:48,839 --> 01:20:49,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right.

1139
01:20:50,602 --> 01:20:51,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Now let's get to the tweets.

1140
01:20:52,524 --> 01:20:52,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Tweet, tweet.

1141
01:20:53,245 --> 01:20:56,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week we invite you guys to show us your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

1142
01:20:57,367 --> 01:20:59,669
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll invoke some discussion here on our lovely program.

1143
01:20:59,809 --> 01:21:02,751
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys sent quite a few tweets tonight, so we'll start it off with Red Entertainment.

1144
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:07,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Jumping ahead a little bit here, but I'll go ahead since most people know about this already.

1145
01:21:07,814 --> 01:21:09,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XIII 2.

1146
01:21:10,016 --> 01:21:13,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Shouldn't they be putting their attention towards fixing the fuck up that is Final Fantasy XIV?

1147
01:21:14,759 --> 01:21:16,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but that's going to take some time.

1148
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:16,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously?

1149
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XIV relaunch in the US?

1150
01:21:19,822 --> 01:21:21,003
[SPEAKER_07]: At least Christmas.

1151
01:21:21,624 --> 01:21:22,164
[SPEAKER_07]: If not later.

1152
01:21:22,324 --> 01:21:23,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1153
01:21:35,592 --> 01:21:54,829
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true Alright, let's see Spazinator, PSM There are rumors that an MGS HD collection is in the works A Metal Gear Solid HD collection I wouldn't be surprised We've got two already coming out in March We've got the Tomb Raider and the Prince of Persia Ah, good point

1154
01:21:55,905 --> 01:21:57,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just had the Sly Collection.

1155
01:21:58,107 --> 01:22:00,629
[SPEAKER_06]: It's popular nowadays.

1156
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:04,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on to another tweet from Spazinator, kind of keeping us up to date on the video releases.

1157
01:22:05,032 --> 01:22:12,618
[SPEAKER_07]: The pilots to Being Human, Perfect Couples, and Fairly Legal are free on Xbox Live, while Perfect Couples and Fairly Legal are free on PlayStation Network.

1158
01:22:13,018 --> 01:22:16,681
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like to sample new TV shows or whatever.

1159
01:22:16,821 --> 01:22:18,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a problem with Being Human.

1160
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:20,727
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that show?

1161
01:22:20,867 --> 01:22:24,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I've watched the first two seasons of it on BBC America.

1162
01:22:25,651 --> 01:22:28,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a show about... No, it's not a comedy.

1163
01:22:29,174 --> 01:22:30,055
[SPEAKER_07]: No, a copy show.

1164
01:22:30,495 --> 01:22:34,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's about a vampire, a ghost, and a werewolf that live in the same flat.

1165
01:22:34,679 --> 01:22:35,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like the beginning of a joke.

1166
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:40,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said the same thing, but it's actually a really good show, at least the British one is.

1167
01:22:40,544 --> 01:22:42,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard the American one is not so good.

1168
01:22:43,689 --> 01:22:44,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1169
01:23:02,421 --> 01:23:02,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1170
01:23:03,201 --> 01:23:03,901
[SPEAKER_07]: There's this show.

1171
01:23:03,921 --> 01:23:05,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how far do I want to get into this.

1172
01:23:05,902 --> 01:23:07,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you heard about that Skins show?

1173
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:09,723
[SPEAKER_07]: It's big in the UK.

1174
01:23:09,743 --> 01:23:10,883
[SPEAKER_07]: They made it here on MTV.

1175
01:23:11,143 --> 01:23:12,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I have zero interest in that show.

1176
01:23:12,783 --> 01:23:13,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Zero.

1177
01:23:13,483 --> 01:23:16,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, if there's a number less than zero, I have that amount of interest.

1178
01:23:16,444 --> 01:23:17,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Negative Infinity?

1179
01:23:17,404 --> 01:23:19,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Negative Infinity is my interest level for that.

1180
01:23:21,345 --> 01:23:24,866
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can't get away from it on my entertainment gossip websites, which pisses me off.

1181
01:23:25,906 --> 01:23:26,926
[SPEAKER_07]: ActDeft sends us a tweet.

1182
01:23:26,966 --> 01:23:28,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's about the PSP 2.

1183
01:23:29,187 --> 01:23:29,847
[SPEAKER_07]: A little rumor.

1184
01:23:31,984 --> 01:23:47,388
[SPEAKER_07]: 3G connectivity and a very fancy screen on the PSP2 if this tweet from Actdeft is to be believed where he links us to a story on Kotaku apparently it's a report from Nikkei that the portable in Japan will be on the NTT Dokomo network via 3G

1185
01:23:49,749 --> 01:23:54,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Could that mean like this is going to be like T-Mobile's answer to the iPhone?

1186
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:55,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I don't know.

1187
01:23:55,532 --> 01:23:56,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pulling that out of my ass.

1188
01:23:56,612 --> 01:24:00,474
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of the providers that doesn't have the iPhone, maybe they'll have the PSP2.

1189
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:01,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1190
01:24:01,814 --> 01:24:03,035
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not saying anything about phone.

1191
01:24:03,435 --> 01:24:05,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Just 3G connection.

1192
01:24:05,396 --> 01:24:06,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like an iPad.

1193
01:24:07,648 --> 01:24:10,529
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be interesting because that means you could play multiplayer anywhere you go.

1194
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:14,251
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you think about 3G on the PSP2?

1195
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:15,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that be cool for you, Loki?

1196
01:24:15,511 --> 01:24:16,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like that?

1197
01:24:26,636 --> 01:24:28,057
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the killer right there.

1198
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:34,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, unless it's included in the price of that system, it's going to be fucking expensive.

1199
01:24:35,502 --> 01:24:41,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're going to have to pay another $100 a month or $60 a month to play your stupid system.

1200
01:24:43,106 --> 01:24:43,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Wi-Fi, no.

1201
01:24:44,087 --> 01:24:44,447
[SPEAKER_06]: No thanks.

1202
01:24:45,788 --> 01:24:51,612
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, if I can do it via Wi-Fi, that's fine.

1203
01:24:51,632 --> 01:24:52,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just tether to my phone.

1204
01:24:53,353 --> 01:24:53,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1205
01:24:54,488 --> 01:24:56,588
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Sterlok sends us a tweet.

1206
01:24:56,649 --> 01:24:58,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Crimson Echoes finally leaked.

1207
01:24:58,309 --> 01:25:00,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Suck it, Square, and then links us to the story.

1208
01:25:00,109 --> 01:25:01,330
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, what's Crimson Echoes?

1209
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:04,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes, it's the fan-made Chrono Trigger sequel.

1210
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:10,292
[SPEAKER_07]: So the fan-made Chrono Trigger sequel finally leaked out to the internet, which we all knew it would.

1211
01:25:10,352 --> 01:25:12,452
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the one that Square Enix shut down not that long ago.

1212
01:25:12,932 --> 01:25:13,432
[SPEAKER_07]: We all knew it.

1213
01:25:13,552 --> 01:25:14,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Once it hits the internet, it's out.

1214
01:25:14,953 --> 01:25:16,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And sure enough, that's what happened.

1215
01:25:16,693 --> 01:25:43,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Crimson Echoes made its way out apparently also a game called Flames of Eternity got leaked which was I guess a branch off of the same title so there you go by the way I'm looking at the fighting in this game it looks like Final Fantasy 6 kind of interesting maybe it's like a really elaborate ROM hack or something I don't know alright let's move on to defective candy I like this send us a tweet connect hacked for surgical robot

1216
01:25:46,203 --> 01:25:57,359
[SPEAKER_07]: a group of graduate students at the University of Washington have modified the firmware and software of the Kinect to guide the actions of surgical robots wow

1217
01:25:59,585 --> 01:26:02,386
[SPEAKER_07]: And it gets into more of the details of this.

1218
01:26:02,426 --> 01:26:03,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking for some quotes here.

1219
01:26:03,887 --> 01:26:05,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just seeing this story for the first time.

1220
01:26:06,108 --> 01:26:09,989
[SPEAKER_07]: The hacked unit adds the sense of touch and feeds information to the surgeon.

1221
01:26:10,429 --> 01:26:15,231
[SPEAKER_07]: The setup could save $50,000 on the standard rig used to perform non-invasive surgery.

1222
01:26:16,352 --> 01:26:19,833
[SPEAKER_07]: We could define basically a force field around, say, a liver.

1223
01:26:20,233 --> 01:26:25,195
[SPEAKER_07]: If the surgeon got too close, he would run into that force field and it would protect the object he didn't want to cut.

1224
01:26:25,755 --> 01:26:26,456
[SPEAKER_07]: That's weird.

1225
01:26:27,489 --> 01:26:30,071
[SPEAKER_07]: But then, what about the day the machines take over?

1226
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:33,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you really want a machine operating on you?

1227
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:35,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Cyberdyne!

1228
01:26:35,575 --> 01:26:36,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, Skynet.

1229
01:26:38,338 --> 01:26:40,159
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple tweets from Tigerclaw.

1230
01:26:42,403 --> 01:27:11,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Telltale Games strongly hints at doing The Walking Dead game I guess really the title says it all but we're linked to a story there The Walking Dead is a show on AMC and it was a comic book series that now is this big TV show I know a few people that are into this I haven't watched this but apparently Telltale Games is hinting that perhaps they're doing something on this and that was well Telltale's got a big event going on they're going to be talking about five new multi-platform efforts and I'm assuming Jurassic Park of course is one of those

1231
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:22,192
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also saying one of the titles announced is based on a just-launched property from the TV and comic book world whose popularity is changing life as some know it.

1232
01:27:22,692 --> 01:27:24,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So some people are inferring that from that.

1233
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:26,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like we'll find out in a month.

1234
01:27:27,214 --> 01:27:27,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Could be interesting.

1235
01:27:28,475 --> 01:27:30,176
[SPEAKER_07]: MNZiba sends us a couple tweets as well.

1236
01:27:30,576 --> 01:27:35,318
[SPEAKER_07]: The Kinect hacker that made himself into a bunch of Minecraft monuments has now put those monuments in motion.

1237
01:27:35,438 --> 01:27:36,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Weren't you saying something about this?

1238
01:27:37,179 --> 01:27:39,140
[SPEAKER_07]: It was during the break or right at the end of Part A. I don't remember.

1239
01:27:39,548 --> 01:27:44,372
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was just saying that we were talking about this a couple weeks ago.

1240
01:27:44,632 --> 01:27:45,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, was it?

1241
01:27:45,733 --> 01:27:46,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there you go.

1242
01:27:46,353 --> 01:27:50,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, this is a Minecraft monument where now it moves.

1243
01:27:50,617 --> 01:27:52,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have never played Minecraft.

1244
01:27:52,278 --> 01:27:53,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make me a bad gamer?

1245
01:27:53,759 --> 01:27:54,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just lazy?

1246
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, I haven't done it either.

1247
01:27:55,661 --> 01:27:55,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Weird.

1248
01:27:57,256 --> 01:28:01,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, apparently the Minecraft monument moves at 30 frames a second while he juggles three balls.

1249
01:28:01,918 --> 01:28:05,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, I mean, I guess if you had to kind of create this, like, bit by bit, it's probably a pain in the ass.

1250
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:06,641
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's better, though?

1251
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:06,961
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1252
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:09,782
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the one that they have where it's a cat chasing a laser.

1253
01:28:11,843 --> 01:28:13,984
[SPEAKER_07]: MNZiba also sends us a tweet about this.

1254
01:28:14,345 --> 01:28:18,307
[SPEAKER_07]: A letter from the Final Fantasy XIV producer explaining upcoming huge changes.

1255
01:28:18,707 --> 01:28:20,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a very long read.

1256
01:28:20,147 --> 01:28:22,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was just produced a little bit this week.

1257
01:28:23,409 --> 01:28:24,830
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually did some polls...

1258
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:29,072
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really long, so I might have to read this while someone else is doing a story.

1259
01:28:29,632 --> 01:28:34,234
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it looks like they really took this poll and kind of like took some of the feedback to heart.

1260
01:28:34,975 --> 01:28:36,796
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are they talking about?

1261
01:28:37,176 --> 01:28:49,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Tutorials for new players, quests revolving around the danger facing the world, public company quests, improvements to the log, improvements of dialogue windows, character jump feature.

1262
01:28:50,823 --> 01:28:51,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1263
01:28:53,089 --> 01:29:17,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Guildlevs so yeah they want to do a whole bunch of new shit in the game we'll just leave it at that there's a long letter available lodestone.finalfantasyxiv the roman way of saying 14.com that's where you can find that last couple tweets here another one from TigerClaw saying consumer group reporting Activision to UK fair trade office over Black Ops glitches and this is a link to a story on Gamasutra

1264
01:29:18,943 --> 01:29:21,104
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a British consumer group, The Gamer's Voice.

1265
01:29:21,464 --> 01:29:28,848
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to complain to the UK Office of Fair Trading about the performance issues in the PS3 and PC versions of Call of Duty Black Ops.

1266
01:29:29,668 --> 01:29:40,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the publisher did not respond to an open letter from the group one month ago, which talked about the freezing and online multiplayer login, that the game is not functioning as intended or advertised.

1267
01:29:40,673 --> 01:29:43,775
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess you could say it's kind of like the Better Business Bureau in a way.

1268
01:29:45,015 --> 01:29:45,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1269
01:29:46,796 --> 01:29:49,317
[SPEAKER_07]: So, somebody's going to take him to task over that one.

1270
01:29:49,357 --> 01:29:49,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1271
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:51,638
[SPEAKER_07]: These things usually don't end up in much.

1272
01:29:51,838 --> 01:29:54,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually like either a settlement or a letter or something.

1273
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:54,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1274
01:29:54,819 --> 01:29:56,579
[SPEAKER_07]: But it'll be interesting to see what happens overseas.

1275
01:29:57,380 --> 01:30:00,080
[SPEAKER_07]: One last tweet from Alex P. Carson on Twitter.

1276
01:30:01,721 --> 01:30:02,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1277
01:30:19,005 --> 01:30:19,305
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1278
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:46,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, maybe this isn't the show for them.

1279
01:30:47,344 --> 01:30:49,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they need to subscribe to a sex podcast.

1280
01:30:49,388 --> 01:30:50,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo!

1281
01:30:50,911 --> 01:30:52,233
[SPEAKER_07]: But we always appreciate any efforts.

1282
01:30:52,534 --> 01:30:53,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

1283
01:30:53,696 --> 01:30:55,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll even read your Twitter name on there.

1284
01:30:55,178 --> 01:30:55,559
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1285
01:30:56,681 --> 01:30:57,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright!

1286
01:30:58,723 --> 01:31:00,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to some more gaming news.

1287
01:31:28,824 --> 01:31:31,312
[SPEAKER_07]: and stuff like that I remember talking about that last week yeah

1288
01:31:32,233 --> 01:31:44,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Because according to the judge, it says if having a PayPal account were enough, then there would be personal jurisdiction in this court over everybody, and that can't be right.

1289
01:31:44,838 --> 01:31:50,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says the case is pending further discussion over jurisdiction, a decision Sony is likely to frown upon.

1290
01:31:52,642 --> 01:31:59,885
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, seeing as how the hack is completely available online, and as I mentioned earlier...

1291
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:02,831
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

1292
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:32,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.

1293
01:32:32,791 --> 01:32:33,872
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be an interesting case.

1294
01:32:36,493 --> 01:32:39,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the story's going to come up every damn week until they settle.

1295
01:32:40,275 --> 01:32:40,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1296
01:32:41,536 --> 01:32:42,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they'll settle either.

1297
01:32:42,397 --> 01:32:46,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have companies using the whole PS3 hacking thing as an excuse.

1298
01:32:46,999 --> 01:32:52,282
[SPEAKER_06]: According to Infinity Ward, I'm assuming this is what's left of Infinity Ward...

1299
01:32:53,262 --> 01:33:00,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Modern Warfare 2 has been kind of made unplayable thanks to people hacking the game.

1300
01:33:00,686 --> 01:33:02,767
[SPEAKER_06]: It says Infinity Ward cannot patch a fix.

1301
01:33:04,447 --> 01:33:06,508
[SPEAKER_06]: People are saying it's making total shambles.

1302
01:33:06,929 --> 01:33:07,809
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unplayable.

1303
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:15,614
[SPEAKER_06]: According to Infinity Wars, these games rely on security of the encryption on the platforms they're played on.

1304
01:33:17,035 --> 01:33:23,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless the security exploit itself is resolved on the platform, updates to the game through patches will not resolve the problem.

1305
01:33:24,461 --> 01:33:28,625
[SPEAKER_06]: At this time, we do not have any ability to restore or adjust individual stats.

1306
01:33:29,345 --> 01:33:35,430
[SPEAKER_06]: We are looking at every option to help us help any user affected and

1307
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:39,901
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1308
01:33:57,541 --> 01:33:58,642
[SPEAKER_06]: and they've been doing that.

1309
01:33:59,262 --> 01:34:03,986
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is totally unrelated to anything that has to do with those PS3 keys.

1310
01:34:04,646 --> 01:34:07,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And on top of that, they're doing the same thing on the 360.

1311
01:34:07,969 --> 01:34:12,772
[SPEAKER_06]: They're hacking save files and stuff and that stuff's kind of been patched.

1312
01:34:14,093 --> 01:34:17,395
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really comes down to they just don't want to fix it.

1313
01:34:18,676 --> 01:34:20,277
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you think about it, why would they?

1314
01:34:20,458 --> 01:34:21,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Modern Warfare 2?

1315
01:34:21,418 --> 01:34:21,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh, whatever.

1316
01:34:22,119 --> 01:34:22,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So it goes to shit.

1317
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:23,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy Black Ops.

1318
01:34:28,344 --> 01:34:36,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know Interesting There's no way to just track down who's fucking up the game and just ban them?

1319
01:34:36,768 --> 01:34:50,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they could but they could just create another account I guess They'd have to actually track down systems Interesting Sorry about that, you cut off there in the beginning So wouldn't that go back to the laziness factor?

1320
01:34:51,074 --> 01:34:52,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so Yep

1321
01:34:53,601 --> 01:34:54,841
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the thing, though.

1322
01:34:54,881 --> 01:34:56,342
[SPEAKER_06]: People aren't actually reading into this.

1323
01:34:56,382 --> 01:35:00,183
[SPEAKER_06]: They're kind of saying, oh, well, thanks, Geohot, for doing all this.

1324
01:35:00,503 --> 01:35:02,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Now Modern Warfare 2 is unplayable.

1325
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:11,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, if you're going to believe everybody and what they say and without doing actual research into what's going on, then sure, go ahead and blame those hackers.

1326
01:35:11,846 --> 01:35:12,666
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is a different...

1327
01:35:13,746 --> 01:35:15,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a special kind of hacker out there.

1328
01:35:15,988 --> 01:35:25,112
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the little kid that figures out, oh hey, I can grief somebody this way or I can cheat in this game and screw it up for everybody.

1329
01:35:25,153 --> 01:35:30,335
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like the whole Grand Theft Auto hacking or modding community.

1330
01:35:30,395 --> 01:35:39,920
[SPEAKER_06]: There's people that actually want to make stuff that's kind of cool and then there's people that want to make cars that freeze people or guns that freeze people's games because they're douchebags and that's what they do.

1331
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:45,184
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no matter what you do, those douchebags will find a way to be a douche.

1332
01:35:45,464 --> 01:35:47,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Play with your friends and nobody else.

1333
01:35:47,845 --> 01:35:48,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1334
01:35:48,305 --> 01:35:51,287
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sadly where some of this is going, honestly, online.

1335
01:35:51,307 --> 01:35:53,289
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to play a legitimate game, you've got to play with your friends.

1336
01:35:53,329 --> 01:35:54,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Take your ball and go home.

1337
01:35:56,070 --> 01:36:01,794
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, some news coming out of Square Enix this week, involving a tweet a little bit ago, kind of references.

1338
01:36:02,154 --> 01:36:04,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XIII 2 was announced.

1339
01:36:04,395 --> 01:36:06,697
[SPEAKER_07]: It is coming out for the 360 and the PlayStation 3.

1340
01:36:07,677 --> 01:36:10,119
[SPEAKER_07]: It was during a little press event that Square Enix had this week.

1341
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:11,240
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1342
01:36:25,976 --> 01:36:33,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, they are saying that Final Fantasy XIII 2 is set to launch in Japan in 2011, but that's probably just Japan.

1343
01:36:33,264 --> 01:36:34,665
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not saying anything about the U.S.

1344
01:36:34,945 --> 01:36:35,526
[SPEAKER_07]: just yet.

1345
01:36:36,487 --> 01:36:37,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, they said next winter.

1346
01:36:37,688 --> 01:36:38,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry about that.

1347
01:36:38,189 --> 01:36:39,510
[SPEAKER_07]: They said next winter is the release.

1348
01:36:39,911 --> 01:36:42,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that mean next February or next December?

1349
01:36:44,134 --> 01:36:45,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you can kind of take that a couple ways.

1350
01:36:45,835 --> 01:36:47,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully it's a quick cycle.

1351
01:36:47,495 --> 01:36:50,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm assuming this is just going to be done in the same engine as the first game was.

1352
01:36:51,837 --> 01:36:53,257
[SPEAKER_07]: But just, you know, new story.

1353
01:36:54,057 --> 01:36:55,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Some new models and all that stuff.

1354
01:36:56,478 --> 01:36:58,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully more Dresh Sphere, right?

1355
01:36:59,319 --> 01:36:59,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

1356
01:37:01,641 --> 01:37:02,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, maybe not.

1357
01:37:03,042 --> 01:37:06,165
[SPEAKER_07]: The name of Final Fantasy Agito 13 has been changed.

1358
01:37:06,225 --> 01:37:12,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now Final Fantasy Type 0, which would explain some of the stories in the past couple weeks about these trademarks showing up.

1359
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:16,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy Type 0 is the game that is coming out instead.

1360
01:37:17,574 --> 01:37:26,722
[SPEAKER_07]: It is going to be on the PSP, of course, and they just said that this title just seems to be more appropriate because this is a more action-oriented design of the game.

1361
01:37:27,462 --> 01:37:28,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And there you go.

1362
01:37:28,063 --> 01:37:29,244
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be coming out to the PSP.

1363
01:37:30,204 --> 01:37:53,313
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 voice characters in the game, multiplayer supposedly in it as well nothing announced just yet for what's going on in North America but it is coming out to Japan this summer on two UMDs not one but two that must be a big game we'll see well how about going back to something that we touched on earlier

1364
01:37:53,891 --> 01:37:54,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1365
01:37:54,371 --> 01:37:55,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a blast from the past.

1366
01:37:55,591 --> 01:37:55,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1367
01:37:56,711 --> 01:37:57,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Duke Nukem Forever.

1368
01:37:58,432 --> 01:37:58,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1369
01:37:59,192 --> 01:38:00,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there going to be download content?

1370
01:38:01,012 --> 01:38:01,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there?

1371
01:38:01,392 --> 01:38:03,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh, huh, huh, huh?

1372
01:38:03,173 --> 01:38:03,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.

1373
01:38:04,213 --> 01:38:14,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they haven't announced anything about it, but they are saying that they are trying to, and this is a quote, on making possible the un-possible, shipping Duke Nukem Forever.

1374
01:38:16,135 --> 01:38:21,876
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are saying that there could be some download content that they are keeping the future in mind.

1375
01:38:23,116 --> 01:38:23,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1376
01:38:24,915 --> 01:38:25,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there will be.

1377
01:38:25,775 --> 01:38:27,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Build your own strip club DLC.

1378
01:38:27,996 --> 01:38:28,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1379
01:38:28,756 --> 01:38:30,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I want voice macros to come back.

1380
01:38:30,876 --> 01:38:31,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be nice.

1381
01:38:31,837 --> 01:38:33,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be surprised if they have DLC.

1382
01:38:33,677 --> 01:38:37,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at the awesome DLC they had for the original Duke Nukem 3D.

1383
01:38:37,918 --> 01:38:41,939
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the fourth episode, the Atomic Edition, which is just awesome.

1384
01:38:42,219 --> 01:38:43,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the supermarket level.

1385
01:38:43,839 --> 01:38:48,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the level that was kind of Disneyland, but not, you know, with the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and stuff.

1386
01:38:49,601 --> 01:38:49,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1387
01:38:51,061 --> 01:38:52,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I just miss Duke Nukem Deathmatch.

1388
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:54,382
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.

1389
01:38:55,948 --> 01:38:58,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope this game is as awesome as the old Duke Nukem was.

1390
01:38:58,430 --> 01:38:58,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do.

1391
01:38:59,311 --> 01:39:00,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty neat.

1392
01:39:00,452 --> 01:39:00,792
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.

1393
01:39:01,052 --> 01:39:01,352
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.

1394
01:39:02,293 --> 01:39:08,278
[SPEAKER_07]: The trailer's sense of humor is any indication, but how often do games look cool and they suck?

1395
01:39:08,338 --> 01:39:09,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as irreverent as the original.

1396
01:39:12,956 --> 01:39:24,866
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some developers out there developing for the iOS platform that are pissed off at Apple because they just don't take piracy or theft seriously.

1397
01:39:27,048 --> 01:39:30,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Theft in this case happens to be a game called The Blocks Cometh.

1398
01:39:31,232 --> 01:39:35,976
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an iPhone game that's out there right now that's completely ripped off of a Flash game.

1399
01:39:36,556 --> 01:39:37,817
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't just copy the game.

1400
01:39:38,037 --> 01:39:38,757
[SPEAKER_06]: They took the name.

1401
01:39:39,057 --> 01:39:41,599
[SPEAKER_06]: They took the assets, the music, everything.

1402
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:42,619
[SPEAKER_06]: They ported it over.

1403
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:46,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, it's not by the creators.

1404
01:39:46,501 --> 01:39:47,682
[SPEAKER_06]: It's by somebody else.

1405
01:39:48,602 --> 01:39:53,705
[SPEAKER_06]: And the creators of the actual game actually have a version for the iPhone that's in the works right now.

1406
01:39:54,565 --> 01:39:55,365
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're pissed off.

1407
01:39:55,466 --> 01:40:05,711
[SPEAKER_06]: They contacted Apple and their customer service or whomever said their legal departments contacted the people responsible for it.

1408
01:40:06,171 --> 01:40:07,872
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've kind of given them the runaround.

1409
01:40:09,093 --> 01:40:13,515
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's nothing really that they seem to be doing.

1410
01:40:14,056 --> 01:40:18,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess it's kind of a serious case if you think about it.

1411
01:40:18,358 --> 01:40:23,961
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just, oh, this game is sort of like Angry Birds or this game is sort of like something else.

1412
01:40:25,501 --> 01:40:28,783
[SPEAKER_06]: We took this game, stole everything from it, and threw it on there.

1413
01:40:28,943 --> 01:40:30,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if I created Super Mario Bros.

1414
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:36,845
[SPEAKER_06]: and popped it onto the iOS, Apple's app store and stuff like that.

1415
01:40:37,345 --> 01:40:38,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, could you?

1416
01:40:38,386 --> 01:40:41,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if this game gets by, why hasn't someone done that yet?

1417
01:40:41,927 --> 01:40:42,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they need to.

1418
01:40:44,248 --> 01:40:46,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario Bros.

1419
01:40:47,429 --> 01:40:48,769
[SPEAKER_07]: or Great Giana Sisters.

1420
01:40:48,889 --> 01:40:49,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1421
01:40:49,349 --> 01:40:49,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Take your pick.

1422
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:52,861
[SPEAKER_07]: The What's Hot Section

1423
01:41:07,953 --> 01:41:10,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling a lot of that runs on an algorithm though.

1424
01:41:10,194 --> 01:41:15,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that they necessarily specifically targeted that game to promote.

1425
01:41:15,758 --> 01:41:16,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're right.

1426
01:41:16,358 --> 01:41:17,619
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably getting a lot of downloads.

1427
01:41:17,899 --> 01:41:21,461
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably been getting a lot of downloads because of the coverage, honestly.

1428
01:41:21,921 --> 01:41:22,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1429
01:41:22,241 --> 01:41:23,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a pay game though?

1430
01:41:25,983 --> 01:41:26,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is a pay game.

1431
01:41:27,264 --> 01:41:28,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Pay games aren't worth it.

1432
01:41:28,405 --> 01:41:33,708
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, Alpha Cananagram, I don't know if you saw this, he's following up in chat saying they have taken it down since then.

1433
01:41:34,208 --> 01:41:35,369
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is no longer there.

1434
01:41:36,902 --> 01:42:05,755
[SPEAKER_07]: but look at what it took for that to happen I think that's still fairly notable you know what I mean nobody saw that right away but of course if I'm working at Apple and I'm testing these apps am I going to recognize this game probably not you know they don't do the peer review thing like XNA does where lots of people are prone to recognize stuff that's ripped off but if it's just like a couple people at Apple I mean I would never recognize that this game was ripped off I'd never play the original so in that way I can kind of

1435
01:42:06,476 --> 01:42:07,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1436
01:42:07,477 --> 01:42:07,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1437
01:42:21,141 --> 01:42:21,501
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1438
01:42:22,322 --> 01:42:28,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so let's move on to another story that has to do with the Rock Band Network.

1439
01:42:30,267 --> 01:42:31,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo, Rock Band!

1440
01:42:32,729 --> 01:42:36,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock Band Network 2.0 is coming out in February!

1441
01:42:36,832 --> 01:42:59,801
[SPEAKER_07]: February 15th is the date to be exact that's when the new track creation system will come out all songs currently being made for Rock Band Network they must be done by February 14th when 1.0 will be phased out and then everything after that for Rock Band Network 2 will require Rock Band 3 I'm assuming this means because of you know the keyboards and all that other stuff so there you go

1442
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:05,364
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, Rock Band 3, sadly, not doing too well on the sales charts, did it?

1443
01:43:05,784 --> 01:43:07,365
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't do too well after Christmas, did it?

1444
01:43:08,065 --> 01:43:08,746
[SPEAKER_07]: That's too bad.

1445
01:43:08,806 --> 01:43:09,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Still awesome.

1446
01:43:09,586 --> 01:43:10,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Still awesome.

1447
01:43:10,807 --> 01:43:11,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

1448
01:43:12,308 --> 01:43:14,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe forcing people to upgrade will do some good.

1449
01:43:14,429 --> 01:43:18,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they should just slash the price of the game to 20 bucks and watch it fly off shelves.

1450
01:43:19,512 --> 01:43:21,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I have a friend that bought the pro guitar.

1451
01:43:22,014 --> 01:43:22,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah?

1452
01:43:22,434 --> 01:43:23,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty heavy.

1453
01:43:24,395 --> 01:43:25,016
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool, too.

1454
01:43:27,874 --> 01:43:36,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so with that, I guess we're going to get into the mailbag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place where you send us emails every week.

1455
01:43:37,717 --> 01:43:40,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to get into the mailbag.

1456
01:43:42,478 --> 01:43:50,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we actually, well, the mailbag kind of sucks because we've got nothing in it.

1457
01:43:52,901 --> 01:43:53,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Read the spam!

1458
01:43:54,863 --> 01:44:01,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we don't have any spam either, so I dedicate this to everyone who did not send an email.

1459
01:44:02,969 --> 01:44:06,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take the box!

1460
01:44:06,872 --> 01:44:07,372
[SPEAKER_09]: The box!

1461
01:44:07,872 --> 01:44:09,093
[SPEAKER_09]: You took the box?

1462
01:44:10,655 --> 01:44:12,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see what's in the box!

1463
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing!

1464
01:44:19,641 --> 01:44:21,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely nothing!

1465
01:44:21,463 --> 01:44:21,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing!

1466
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:23,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid!

1467
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:26,292
[SPEAKER_09]: You're so stupid!

1468
01:44:29,114 --> 01:44:29,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1469
01:44:30,635 --> 01:44:30,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1470
01:44:33,077 --> 01:44:35,479
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's the movie that Dan and I got engaged over.

1471
01:44:35,599 --> 01:44:36,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I remember that.

1472
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:37,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1473
01:44:38,301 --> 01:44:40,122
[SPEAKER_07]: You want a drink from the fire hose.

1474
01:44:41,183 --> 01:44:41,703
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's funny?

1475
01:44:41,883 --> 01:44:43,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Wheel of fish.

1476
01:44:43,664 --> 01:44:45,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I've ever seen that movie from start to finish.

1477
01:44:46,126 --> 01:44:46,767
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the best one.

1478
01:44:47,167 --> 01:44:47,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Badgers!

1479
01:44:48,408 --> 01:44:48,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Badgers!

1480
01:44:49,368 --> 01:44:51,210
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't need no stinking badgers!

1481
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:51,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Badgers!

1482
01:44:53,502 --> 01:44:55,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Weird Al needs to do another movie, don't you think?

1483
01:44:56,225 --> 01:44:57,006
[SPEAKER_02]: He totally does.

1484
01:44:57,426 --> 01:44:57,727
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1485
01:44:59,468 --> 01:45:01,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to the FUs of the week.

1486
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:03,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what an appropriate time to get into this segment.

1487
01:45:03,633 --> 01:45:04,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I know we have some of these.

1488
01:45:21,099 --> 01:45:25,702
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to certain situations that are beyond my control that involve finances and my house.

1489
01:45:27,943 --> 01:45:28,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

1490
01:45:29,844 --> 01:45:34,827
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the people at A&W for not knowing how to fill up a half gallon of root beer.

1491
01:45:35,527 --> 01:45:45,793
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually not to mention it is impossible to transport this without it spilling everywhere as it was and it made it very difficult to drive.

1492
01:45:45,813 --> 01:45:48,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I will never be buying a half gallon root beer again.

1493
01:45:48,634 --> 01:45:49,435
[SPEAKER_06]: It is just too much root beer.

1494
01:45:49,475 --> 01:45:49,715
[SPEAKER_06]: A half

1495
01:45:49,775 --> 01:45:50,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1496
01:46:08,161 --> 01:46:09,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, my FU of the week.

1497
01:46:09,682 --> 01:46:10,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to be vague.

1498
01:46:10,783 --> 01:46:13,585
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually a lot of stuff going on, but nothing I can talk about on my public show.

1499
01:46:13,685 --> 01:46:14,906
[SPEAKER_07]: So, FU to stuff.

1500
01:46:15,706 --> 01:46:16,527
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all stuff.

1501
01:46:17,548 --> 01:46:18,028
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1502
01:46:19,189 --> 01:46:21,350
[SPEAKER_07]: So, let's get back to some gaming news.

1503
01:46:22,231 --> 01:46:25,053
[SPEAKER_07]: And then skyblind in just a little bit after a couple more stories.

1504
01:46:25,553 --> 01:46:26,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you need to cheer me up.

1505
01:46:26,654 --> 01:46:28,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a story that might cheer me up?

1506
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yes.

1507
01:46:29,536 --> 01:46:33,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about the brand new, um, Yogi Bear movie.

1508
01:46:34,139 --> 01:46:36,041
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not cheered up.

1509
01:46:36,081 --> 01:46:36,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1510
01:46:37,081 --> 01:46:39,722
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's about Tiger Woods and a weird glitch.

1511
01:46:39,762 --> 01:46:41,142
[SPEAKER_06]: This really isn't cheering me up.

1512
01:46:41,643 --> 01:46:48,485
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about a weird glitch that's being reported, I don't even know if we should take this seriously, by The Sun.

1513
01:46:49,145 --> 01:46:51,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the tabloid magazine in the UK.

1514
01:46:52,846 --> 01:47:08,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, apparently, there was a glitch that this one woman has, um, encountered Britt and Joe, um, Ile, or whatever, um, apparently, her avatar that she had set up on there one day, when she popped on the game, it was topless!

1515
01:47:09,394 --> 01:47:10,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, now you have my attention.

1516
01:47:10,354 --> 01:47:10,534
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1517
01:47:10,574 --> 01:47:10,874
[SPEAKER_07]: What's this?

1518
01:47:10,894 --> 01:47:11,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Nipples and everything.

1519
01:47:11,955 --> 01:47:12,175
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1520
01:47:12,195 --> 01:47:20,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the, um, the avatar is topless, and, uh, of course, EA was quick to say that, um,

1521
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:26,663
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no possible way that that could have been done without some sort of hack.

1522
01:47:27,863 --> 01:47:34,005
[SPEAKER_06]: But, as we've seen with games like Heavy Rain, I could believe that it could be done.

1523
01:47:35,665 --> 01:47:40,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, she doesn't actually have boob textures or whatever.

1524
01:47:40,686 --> 01:47:48,708
[SPEAKER_06]: The nipple bumps are there for the clothing and stuff, but I think that just for some reason it's not drawing the clothing on.

1525
01:47:50,766 --> 01:48:17,755
[SPEAKER_06]: but she's topless and playing golf boobies you know what you get those women topless and playing golf I bet you a lot more people Tiger Woods would sell like twice as many copies as it does now Tiger Woods the M rated golf game there you go well it just took a story about boobies to cheer me up a little bit Tiger Boobs I like that

1526
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:19,331
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1527
01:48:35,808 --> 01:48:37,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now coming back on the Xbox 360.

1528
01:48:38,632 --> 01:48:41,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Judgment Silver Sword and the remix Cardinal Sins.

1529
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:43,839
[SPEAKER_07]: They are both going to be coming out.

1530
01:48:43,899 --> 01:48:47,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they're bonuses in a new 360 retail shmup.

1531
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Eshkatos?

1532
01:48:49,447 --> 01:48:50,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I'm saying that right.

1533
01:48:50,909 --> 01:48:52,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course all these games are coming out in Japan.

1534
01:48:53,332 --> 01:49:15,292
[SPEAKER_07]: there's two trailers for this game that are out there on the internet you can import it on March 24th I like this because I guess there's like one trailer here that shows like a split because you know how like vertical shmups on the 360 don't use much real estate on the screen at all like there's all this wasted horizontal space well in this game sorry it's a little loud sorry guys

1535
01:49:16,043 --> 01:49:18,666
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks very pretty, I gotta say.

1536
01:49:19,106 --> 01:49:21,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Like some of the effects they're doing and stuff.

1537
01:49:21,408 --> 01:49:27,694
[SPEAKER_07]: But then there's one part of the trailer here where they're showing multiplayer in like three screens on the screen at once.

1538
01:49:28,595 --> 01:49:29,256
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1539
01:49:31,558 --> 01:49:32,199
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very cool.

1540
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they're dodging lots and lots of bullets.

1541
01:49:37,103 --> 01:49:37,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And dying.

1542
01:49:38,789 --> 01:49:45,513
[SPEAKER_07]: WonderSwan Color shoot-em-ups making a return on the 360, but only in Japan, which makes sense because WonderSwan Color was only out in Japan, never came out here.

1543
01:49:45,593 --> 01:49:46,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a good system, too.

1544
01:49:47,935 --> 01:49:49,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Our Skype line is now open.

1545
01:49:49,436 --> 01:49:55,880
[SPEAKER_07]: You can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1546
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,160
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go ahead and give us a call.

1547
01:49:57,421 --> 01:49:59,122
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about whatever it is you want to talk about.

1548
01:49:59,722 --> 01:50:01,843
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime, should we see if there's any last-minute stories?

1549
01:50:01,863 --> 01:50:06,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know it takes about a minute until the folks that are listening hear us begging for calls.

1550
01:50:06,428 --> 01:50:13,394
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a rumor, uh, well, we talked a little bit about this, the 3G and stuff, and the OLD screen, uh, PSP2, already, I'm assuming.

1551
01:50:13,515 --> 01:50:15,016
[SPEAKER_06]: That was in Twitter topics, now that I think of it.

1552
01:50:15,136 --> 01:50:15,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1553
01:50:15,757 --> 01:50:16,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, nevermind.

1554
01:50:17,158 --> 01:50:20,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I had to pull it up and I was ready to go and everything.

1555
01:50:20,841 --> 01:50:24,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no, I know I have more stuff to talk about here, I just have to pull it up.

1556
01:50:26,226 --> 01:50:26,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Do-do-do.

1557
01:50:28,648 --> 01:50:28,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1558
01:50:31,598 --> 01:50:32,358
[SPEAKER_06]: What was I going to say?

1559
01:50:33,319 --> 01:50:34,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Words?

1560
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:37,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Words, yes, specifically.

1561
01:50:37,921 --> 01:50:51,848
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was going to say that those people out there that are thinking about possibly hacking your PlayStation 3 using the readily available custom firmwares that are out there, you may remember that they have ways of tracking you down.

1562
01:50:52,028 --> 01:50:57,351
[SPEAKER_06]: So make sure you get one of those things that erases your... What was it?

1563
01:50:57,371 --> 01:50:57,491
[SPEAKER_06]: The...

1564
01:51:00,636 --> 01:51:02,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Game History or something like that.

1565
01:51:02,658 --> 01:51:08,082
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the new programs still have that built in so that you don't get caught.

1566
01:51:10,764 --> 01:51:11,285
[SPEAKER_06]: LA Noire.

1567
01:51:11,585 --> 01:51:15,788
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a game that also had a trailer leaked out for it.

1568
01:51:16,829 --> 01:51:19,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Also going to be coming out from Take-Two in May.

1569
01:51:19,691 --> 01:51:21,413
[SPEAKER_06]: This on May 17th.

1570
01:51:22,193 --> 01:51:24,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Big game for Rockstar.

1571
01:51:24,995 --> 01:51:25,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks awesome.

1572
01:51:27,377 --> 01:51:36,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Plants vs. Zombies and Peggle coming to the Android Marketplace the second quarter of this year.

1573
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:39,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty neat.

1574
01:51:41,283 --> 01:51:42,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the phones are open.

1575
01:51:42,644 --> 01:51:43,024
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1576
01:51:43,044 --> 01:51:44,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, call!

1577
01:51:44,385 --> 01:51:47,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Our usual name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1578
01:51:48,927 --> 01:51:49,868
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be another one of those nights.

1579
01:51:49,888 --> 01:51:53,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your lazy butts up, pick up your phone, and give us a call.

1580
01:51:54,190 --> 01:51:55,190
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have something to say.

1581
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:56,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to sit here on the line.

1582
01:51:57,031 --> 01:52:00,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about a video game, and you better not be... What's your face?

1583
01:52:02,714 --> 01:52:04,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Now see, I saw this story and I thought of you, Jamie.

1584
01:52:06,075 --> 01:52:14,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Epic Mickey, they're talking about 10 different Easter eggs that are in this game from different Disney history and stuff like that.

1585
01:52:14,117 --> 01:52:24,119
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, in the game, actually in Mickey Junk Mountain, they actually have a basketball court in the...

1586
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:27,741
[SPEAKER_06]: in that part of the game as well.

1587
01:52:28,001 --> 01:52:28,261
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1588
01:52:28,281 --> 01:52:31,643
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of allude to the basketball court that's in Matterhorn.

1589
01:52:32,064 --> 01:52:32,864
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1590
01:52:32,964 --> 01:52:33,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the phones.

1591
01:52:33,685 --> 01:52:34,585
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have a call on the line.

1592
01:52:34,645 --> 01:52:35,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1593
01:52:35,686 --> 01:52:36,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1594
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:38,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, can you hear me?

1595
01:52:38,308 --> 01:52:38,848
[SPEAKER_07]: We sure can.

1596
01:52:38,948 --> 01:52:39,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is this?

1597
01:52:40,169 --> 01:52:41,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.

1598
01:52:41,490 --> 01:52:42,631
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Dollar Bill.

1599
01:52:42,731 --> 01:52:43,371
[SPEAKER_07]: What is on your mind?

1600
01:52:44,512 --> 01:52:45,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, not much.

1601
01:52:46,253 --> 01:52:53,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I took your advice a couple weeks ago, and then I actually picked up a, well, I guess you could call it an indie game, but one that's been getting a whole bunch of hype from everybody.

1602
01:52:53,979 --> 01:52:54,339
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

1603
01:52:55,404 --> 01:52:55,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Minecraft.

1604
01:52:57,185 --> 01:52:57,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, okay.

1605
01:52:57,966 --> 01:53:03,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, for those that didn't hear, you called in a couple weeks ago and I believe it was something about, I am just frustrated with games today.

1606
01:53:04,351 --> 01:53:09,376
[SPEAKER_07]: It's same shit, different year, you know, I feel like there's no games for me to play.

1607
01:53:09,396 --> 01:53:10,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, well, try indie.

1608
01:53:10,777 --> 01:53:14,580
[SPEAKER_07]: So you went for a popular indie title, but an indie one nonetheless, Minecraft.

1609
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,401
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think of Minecraft?

1610
01:53:18,723 --> 01:53:19,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

1611
01:53:19,444 --> 01:53:19,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we lose him?

1612
01:53:21,045 --> 01:53:21,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you still hear us?

1613
01:53:23,715 --> 01:53:24,295
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn it.

1614
01:53:24,976 --> 01:53:25,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we lost.

1615
01:53:25,596 --> 01:53:26,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me?

1616
01:53:26,177 --> 01:53:26,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we can now.

1617
01:53:26,997 --> 01:53:27,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1618
01:53:27,618 --> 01:53:29,439
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think of... Hi.

1619
01:53:29,459 --> 01:53:29,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Stupid mic.

1620
01:53:30,019 --> 01:53:30,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you mute yourself?

1621
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:31,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, can you hear me?

1622
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:32,281
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think of Minecraft?

1623
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:35,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we can.

1624
01:53:35,903 --> 01:53:37,564
[SPEAKER_10]: For a beta, I'm very impressed.

1625
01:53:38,505 --> 01:53:38,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?

1626
01:53:40,086 --> 01:53:40,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1627
01:53:40,726 --> 01:53:44,829
[SPEAKER_10]: It's weird that it's the total freedom to do anything.

1628
01:53:45,928 --> 01:53:51,694
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost like I feel like I have nothing to do, but I'm just enjoying just doing nothing.

1629
01:53:52,214 --> 01:53:54,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I have never played Minecraft.

1630
01:53:54,276 --> 01:53:56,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I read a lot about it on the interwebs, but I've not played it.

1631
01:53:56,919 --> 01:53:59,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So can you tell me what Minecraft is?

1632
01:53:59,281 --> 01:54:00,242
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you do in Minecraft?

1633
01:54:02,684 --> 01:54:10,491
[SPEAKER_10]: The best way I could say this is you pretty much make stuff to sort of build...

1634
01:54:11,499 --> 01:54:20,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the idea is that you pretty much have to build your shelter and your tools and everything out of different parts you find here and there during the day.

1635
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:26,462
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have to make a good shelter because at night you get invaded by zombies and skeletons and spiders.

1636
01:54:28,116 --> 01:54:32,319
[SPEAKER_10]: So you want to be safe at night, and then you do the same thing every day.

1637
01:54:32,579 --> 01:54:38,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Daytime, you build stuff and raise trees and make flowers and kill animals for food.

1638
01:54:38,763 --> 01:54:41,985
[SPEAKER_10]: At night, you pretty much either hide or you defend yourself.

1639
01:54:42,185 --> 01:54:49,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so there is kind of an actual game to it, because I was always under the impression that there really wasn't a lot to it outside of creation and building.

1640
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:51,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool.

1641
01:54:51,311 --> 01:54:55,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so you're trying to prevent zombies from eating your face.

1642
01:54:55,573 --> 01:54:56,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I like stuff...

1643
01:54:56,954 --> 01:54:58,374
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool.

1644
01:54:58,754 --> 01:55:05,956
[SPEAKER_07]: So did this help kind of break your video game blaws or are you still looking for that game that just makes you love video games again?

1645
01:55:08,336 --> 01:55:14,757
[SPEAKER_10]: It sort of helped kill the blaws because I also realized that I'm pretty much a PC gamer for life now.

1646
01:55:17,638 --> 01:55:22,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty much shied away from PS3 and Xbox and I like playing on a PC a lot better.

1647
01:55:22,679 --> 01:55:22,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

1648
01:55:24,636 --> 01:55:25,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give you an example.

1649
01:55:25,877 --> 01:55:29,219
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried out the demo the other day for Mass Effect 2 just for shits and giggles.

1650
01:55:31,781 --> 01:55:35,823
[SPEAKER_10]: It ran so much better on my computer than on the Xbox or PS3.

1651
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:44,609
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's more a matter of you feel like the technology that the games need today, maybe the console cycle's gone on too long.

1652
01:55:45,149 --> 01:55:47,190
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, let's face it, 360's been out now.

1653
01:55:47,230 --> 01:55:48,611
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going on its fifth year, right?

1654
01:55:49,111 --> 01:55:51,293
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe it's time for some new consoles?

1655
01:55:51,313 --> 01:55:51,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1656
01:55:52,960 --> 01:56:02,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, either that or some heavy updates and whatnot, because my computer's not that old either, but it was running circles around, like, the consoles.

1657
01:56:02,909 --> 01:56:04,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, what the hell?

1658
01:56:04,731 --> 01:56:10,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a lot of it has to do with your, um, uh, lost the word, the video card as well.

1659
01:56:10,956 --> 01:56:12,117
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's a big part of it, too.

1660
01:56:12,418 --> 01:56:13,719
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have a newer video card in your system?

1661
01:56:14,878 --> 01:56:17,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, I got one just last year.

1662
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:19,640
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still a new one.

1663
01:56:20,021 --> 01:56:27,004
[SPEAKER_10]: My processor's old, but it's one of those things where, logically, it doesn't make sense, but it just works.

1664
01:56:28,425 --> 01:56:33,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com, Bochikawa says, Minecraft is like Legos, the RPG.

1665
01:56:33,768 --> 01:56:38,530
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there is actually a really fun, like, just a Lego builder game that is on the official Lego website.

1666
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:39,291
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really a game.

1667
01:56:39,331 --> 01:56:39,851
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a tool.

1668
01:56:40,151 --> 01:56:40,471
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1669
01:57:07,279 --> 01:57:07,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome!

1670
01:57:08,799 --> 01:57:12,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, DDR Dollar Bill, we're going to let you go to get some more calls, but any quick final thoughts for our listeners?

1671
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:15,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, support PC gaming.

1672
01:57:16,481 --> 01:57:17,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll try.

1673
01:57:17,661 --> 01:57:20,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Steam is going to save PC gaming, if it hasn't already.

1674
01:57:21,442 --> 01:57:22,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Steam rocks.

1675
01:57:22,782 --> 01:57:23,722
[SPEAKER_07]: And the indie stuff, of course.

1676
01:57:23,962 --> 01:57:24,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

1677
01:57:25,362 --> 01:57:26,983
[SPEAKER_07]: You too, thanks guys.

1678
01:57:27,003 --> 01:57:30,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype if you want to give us a call.

1679
01:57:31,403 --> 01:57:33,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other last minute stories for us?

1680
01:57:33,924 --> 01:57:34,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I have nothing.

1681
01:57:36,137 --> 01:57:36,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure.

1682
01:57:37,158 --> 01:57:38,218
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll just have to make something up.

1683
01:57:38,878 --> 01:57:41,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, no, I want DarkSakura to make something up.

1684
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:42,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Make up a video game news story.

1685
01:57:42,839 --> 01:57:44,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that actually didn't happen.

1686
01:57:51,801 --> 01:57:53,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm putting her on the spot, people.

1687
01:57:53,162 --> 01:57:53,862
[SPEAKER_07]: It's live radio.

1688
01:57:56,653 --> 01:57:56,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Chirp.

1689
01:57:57,773 --> 01:57:58,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Chirp.

1690
01:57:58,674 --> 01:58:00,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, a new Angry Birds game is coming out?

1691
01:58:00,474 --> 01:58:04,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a new Angry Birds versus DarkSakura.

1692
01:58:05,395 --> 01:58:07,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Angry Birds versus Angry Co-host.

1693
01:58:08,676 --> 01:58:11,917
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was going to say Angry Birds versus Zombies.

1694
01:58:13,317 --> 01:58:19,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, because everything indie these days is something something versus Zombies, right?

1695
01:58:20,479 --> 01:58:21,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed.

1696
01:58:21,359 --> 01:58:22,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to another call.

1697
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:23,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1698
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:23,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1699
01:58:24,212 --> 01:58:25,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is X-Link.

1700
01:58:25,133 --> 01:58:25,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, buddy, how you doing?

1701
01:58:26,394 --> 01:58:26,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, doing good.

1702
01:58:27,035 --> 01:58:30,879
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to play with the PS3 Move for my first time.

1703
01:58:31,299 --> 01:58:32,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, what'd you think of the PS3 Move?

1704
01:58:33,294 --> 01:58:35,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I, depending on the game, I really like it.

1705
01:58:36,076 --> 01:58:44,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Though I did like the bowling and the sports one they had out.

1706
01:58:44,902 --> 01:58:45,922
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty fun.

1707
01:58:46,723 --> 01:58:47,443
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun.

1708
01:58:47,523 --> 01:58:54,228
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a lot of similarities to that of Wii, but the graphics and the way they did it was a lot better.

1709
01:58:54,568 --> 01:58:59,852
[SPEAKER_00]: The output and the way it was controlled was, I think, personally for me, was a lot smoother.

1710
01:58:59,992 --> 01:59:00,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1711
01:59:02,104 --> 01:59:06,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe this is a really hard question to ask, but it's something I've given a lot of thought to myself.

1712
01:59:06,187 --> 01:59:08,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I've said this on the show before.

1713
01:59:08,870 --> 01:59:18,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Connect and Move, they're out there now, and most of the games that have come out originally are, for the most part, with a few exceptions, copies of Wii games with nicer graphics.

1714
01:59:18,839 --> 01:59:20,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do you think the Move goes next?

1715
01:59:21,141 --> 01:59:24,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you see the Move integrated into Sony's core franchises?

1716
01:59:24,764 --> 01:59:25,265
[SPEAKER_00]: The world.

1717
01:59:25,725 --> 01:59:27,727
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to become the world like that of .hack//.

1718
01:59:28,362 --> 01:59:32,549
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna have visors and everything and it's gonna become one big MMO.

1719
01:59:33,874 --> 01:59:36,595
[SPEAKER_07]: It already is in their core franchises.

1720
01:59:36,615 --> 01:59:38,515
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of it really feels like an afterthought, though.

1721
01:59:38,555 --> 01:59:39,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Like LittleBigPlanet 2.

1722
01:59:40,036 --> 01:59:42,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the move support's there, in a bonus level.

1723
01:59:42,496 --> 01:59:43,416
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I understand that.

1724
01:59:43,456 --> 01:59:44,357
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just retarded.

1725
01:59:44,397 --> 01:59:47,377
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just basically the prehistoric thing that's in there.

1726
01:59:48,117 --> 01:59:53,379
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm saying it's in their core franchises, as in SOCOM 4 and Killzone 3.

1727
01:59:54,299 --> 01:59:55,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are core franchises.

1728
01:59:55,819 --> 01:59:56,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1729
01:59:56,579 --> 02:00:02,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, I don't pay attention to a lot of the first-person shooters, and I remember seeing that at the GDC even, but...

1730
02:00:02,941 --> 02:00:08,125
[SPEAKER_06]: But granted, their gun that they have, their little shell, is retarded looking.

1731
02:00:09,066 --> 02:00:09,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

1732
02:00:11,128 --> 02:00:12,029
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree with you.

1733
02:00:12,109 --> 02:00:12,889
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you on that.

1734
02:00:13,730 --> 02:00:20,796
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that people will step up to the plate on those things and make stuff better, like actual better looking guns and stuff like that.

1735
02:00:22,105 --> 02:00:26,026
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, for example, like Time Crisis with Namco, I like the guns they use.

1736
02:00:26,086 --> 02:00:29,167
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you feel like you're playing the arcade with the actual guns.

1737
02:00:29,227 --> 02:00:33,529
[SPEAKER_00]: So the guns are quite different from that of the arcade because of the feedback and whatnot.

1738
02:00:34,409 --> 02:00:35,490
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no pedal button.

1739
02:00:35,530 --> 02:00:38,230
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I think it'll do good.

1740
02:00:38,771 --> 02:00:40,491
[SPEAKER_00]: It's moving in the right direction, I believe.

1741
02:00:42,272 --> 02:00:47,333
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad, though, because it's really killing off stuff like arcades and stuff that I grew up loving as a kid.

1742
02:00:47,393 --> 02:00:49,454
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it's hard to compete.

1743
02:00:50,103 --> 02:00:50,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1744
02:00:59,335 --> 02:01:02,216
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, MMOs for real used to be going to the arcade.

1745
02:01:02,276 --> 02:01:04,157
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't know.

1746
02:01:04,297 --> 02:01:05,438
[SPEAKER_00]: It's depressing.

1747
02:01:05,678 --> 02:01:09,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of booting up your computer or your Xbox and playing the game.

1748
02:01:09,279 --> 02:01:10,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really was.

1749
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:20,023
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a lot of fun putting your quarters and stuff on top of, you know, in certain areas saying, hey, look, I want to be next, you know, or have to be, you know, wait in line.

1750
02:01:20,264 --> 02:01:24,265
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I guess maybe it saved that 20-minute wait from playing that one game that you really want to play.

1751
02:01:24,345 --> 02:01:25,746
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, too, you know...

1752
02:01:27,167 --> 02:01:27,867
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sad.

1753
02:01:28,167 --> 02:01:33,490
[SPEAKER_00]: That feeling you got of being around a big crowd and they're cheering you on and stuff.

1754
02:01:33,730 --> 02:01:34,871
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really the same.

1755
02:01:36,251 --> 02:01:44,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would be cool if they would make an MMO that kind of, if you can't beat them, join them.

1756
02:01:45,156 --> 02:01:47,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Make an MMO about going to arcades.

1757
02:01:47,237 --> 02:01:48,498
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what Game Room should have been.

1758
02:01:48,518 --> 02:01:52,280
[SPEAKER_07]: An MMO where you're going to the arcade and playing these old school games and

1759
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:57,665
[SPEAKER_07]: and the better you get at games, the better you can skill up your character to maybe help you get like cheap.

1760
02:01:57,826 --> 02:01:59,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to say cheap, but get better in other games.

1761
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:00,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1762
02:02:00,589 --> 02:02:01,429
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an idea there.

1763
02:02:01,650 --> 02:02:02,711
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree on that.

1764
02:02:02,851 --> 02:02:03,351
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be cool.

1765
02:02:03,632 --> 02:02:04,933
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the best thing you played on Move?

1766
02:02:04,973 --> 02:02:06,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll kind of end it with that question.

1767
02:02:07,095 --> 02:02:08,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, unfortunately, I only played two different games.

1768
02:02:08,757 --> 02:02:12,181
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably the bowling because I did really well against my friends on that one.

1769
02:02:12,241 --> 02:02:14,183
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Bronx was bowling.

1770
02:02:16,419 --> 02:02:33,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, really quickly, Gearbox I think is going to do really great with the Duke Nukem because they did a really great job with Borderlands and their DLC, so if they keep it close to making it somewhat of the original feel, from what I've seen from the trailers and stuff, I think they're going to do a really good job.

1771
02:02:34,086 --> 02:02:36,387
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be really interesting to see what they do with it.

1772
02:02:37,207 --> 02:03:00,446
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know they really are with their fans and what the fans want so I wouldn't be surprised if they make some kind of mod so you can build your own strip club or or build your own like miniature you know I would see a lot of that probably coming out near down the road also because a lot of feedback has been really positive on it so and they really want what the people want so it's that's been a really good positive thing too so

1773
02:03:01,594 --> 02:03:08,536
[SPEAKER_07]: One day, one day we'll have our arcades again, but we'll take that next great invention to bring people back.

1774
02:03:09,316 --> 02:03:09,576
[SPEAKER_00]: UQ.

1775
02:03:09,756 --> 02:03:15,898
[SPEAKER_07]: More beer in arcades, that's what it really needs, because you look at the arcades that are popular, Dave & Buster's, the retro arcades, they all serve beer.

1776
02:03:16,998 --> 02:03:21,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's one by where I used to live, believe it or not, that did the same thing too, and it was very popular.

1777
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:23,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Less kids, more beer.

1778
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:27,841
[SPEAKER_00]: It's EDR, so I mean, pretty much go hand in hand, so yeah.

1779
02:03:29,037 --> 02:03:31,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well buddy, we're going to let you go to try and fit in a couple more calls, but have a good one.

1780
02:03:32,498 --> 02:03:33,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you too, no problem.

1781
02:03:33,358 --> 02:03:34,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, thanks, bye.

1782
02:03:35,559 --> 02:03:37,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so let's go to another call.

1783
02:03:37,720 --> 02:03:39,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1784
02:03:40,721 --> 02:03:41,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's Zappy.

1785
02:03:41,801 --> 02:03:43,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Zappy, how you doing?

1786
02:03:44,262 --> 02:03:44,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, pretty good.

1787
02:03:45,262 --> 02:03:46,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

1788
02:03:47,843 --> 02:03:56,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I've been playing one of the big releases of the week, well, only big releases of the week, Little Big Plan 2, and I can't say more than it's awesome.

1789
02:03:56,894 --> 02:03:58,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed that there's a lot more variety when I'm playing it.

1790
02:03:58,515 --> 02:04:03,338
[SPEAKER_07]: LittleBigPlanet 1 was a good, solid platformer, but with the second one, they really tried to make it different, having different gimmicks in it.

1791
02:04:03,378 --> 02:04:04,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Sort of like how they had Yoshi in Super Mario World.

1792
02:04:27,009 --> 02:04:32,354
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's some of the cool stuff you've seen in the user-created levels?

1793
02:04:32,494 --> 02:04:38,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you've had a chance to dip in there, but have you seen any really cool user-created stuff yet?

1794
02:04:56,747 --> 02:05:01,989
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the cool things I saw was they made an entire tower defense game out of the little big tiny engines.

1795
02:05:02,829 --> 02:05:03,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wow, nice.

1796
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:14,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was kind of surprised they could do that, but they designed this in mind that you can basically take whatever game ideas you want and make it, which is really exciting.

1797
02:05:15,336 --> 02:05:23,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of taking whatever ideas you want and making it, and I apologize for deviating from your call a little bit, but in the last call we were talking about ways to save arcades.

1798
02:05:24,299 --> 02:05:25,860
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course our chat room is going off on that.

1799
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:28,481
[SPEAKER_07]: SJ100Matt says, tits could save arcades.

1800
02:05:29,661 --> 02:05:32,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And Xlink says, now that could be a good idea.

1801
02:05:33,283 --> 02:05:35,343
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe you need to mix strip clubs with arcades.

1802
02:05:35,423 --> 02:05:36,964
[SPEAKER_07]: When in doubt, show some tits.

1803
02:05:38,761 --> 02:05:40,362
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1804
02:06:06,856 --> 02:06:08,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I shit you not, look it up.

1805
02:06:08,417 --> 02:06:09,398
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on Wikipedia.

1806
02:06:09,518 --> 02:06:10,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Nuts and Milk.

1807
02:06:11,159 --> 02:06:12,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And that could be the name of the arcade.

1808
02:06:12,280 --> 02:06:13,061
[SPEAKER_08]: How does that get past censors?

1809
02:06:13,721 --> 02:06:14,182
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

1810
02:06:15,303 --> 02:06:16,684
[SPEAKER_07]: How does that get past censors?

1811
02:06:16,724 --> 02:06:17,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's Japan.

1812
02:06:17,925 --> 02:06:18,525
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the same.

1813
02:06:18,745 --> 02:06:20,086
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have the same slang.

1814
02:06:20,767 --> 02:06:21,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different.

1815
02:06:22,308 --> 02:06:23,009
[SPEAKER_07]: So, alright.

1816
02:06:24,670 --> 02:06:25,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, LittleBigPlanet 2.

1817
02:06:25,931 --> 02:06:28,933
[SPEAKER_07]: So have you played the Nuts and Milk remake in LittleBigPlanet 2 yet?

1818
02:06:30,594 --> 02:06:33,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it's coming along any day now, but unfortunately not.

1819
02:06:34,257 --> 02:06:35,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's too bad.

1820
02:06:35,717 --> 02:06:38,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so anything else you've been playing lately?

1821
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:41,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a little bit of Planets 2 taking up your time, or any other games?

1822
02:06:42,342 --> 02:06:44,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also been playing some Dead Space, the first one.

1823
02:06:44,764 --> 02:06:46,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking forward to the new one that's coming out this week.

1824
02:06:47,967 --> 02:06:51,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't believe you missed this game in 2008, because it's really fun.

1825
02:06:53,131 --> 02:06:58,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it went off my radar for so long, going, okay, to make a second one, there must be something to it.

1826
02:06:59,496 --> 02:07:02,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't believe it.

1827
02:07:02,858 --> 02:07:04,920
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really going back to the survival horror roots

1828
02:07:05,390 --> 02:07:10,479
[SPEAKER_08]: where you're actually getting freaked out, like you're thinking that something is around that next corner and there might be.

1829
02:07:11,667 --> 02:07:24,390
[SPEAKER_07]: That kind of sucks when games, like, you find out about them, like, three years after they were out, and then, like, by the time you're like, this game was fucking rad, you found out that the development studio got closed and everybody got laid off.

1830
02:07:24,430 --> 02:07:26,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I bet you anything that still happened to Blur.

1831
02:07:28,490 --> 02:07:34,632
[SPEAKER_07]: When the game's down to 20 bucks, if it's not already, it'll start selling more copies, and then people are like, wow, they should really make a sequel to this.

1832
02:07:35,592 --> 02:07:36,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit, they can't.

1833
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:40,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a shame it happened.

1834
02:07:40,742 --> 02:07:41,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, it was pretty fun.

1835
02:07:42,422 --> 02:07:42,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1836
02:07:43,523 --> 02:07:43,823
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1837
02:07:44,184 --> 02:07:46,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight before we let you go?

1838
02:07:47,926 --> 02:07:48,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1839
02:07:48,226 --> 02:07:48,546
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

1840
02:07:48,966 --> 02:07:49,206
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1841
02:07:49,226 --> 02:07:50,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, have fun with LittleBigPlanet 2.

1842
02:07:50,967 --> 02:07:52,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, I'll be playing it pretty soon as well.

1843
02:07:52,828 --> 02:07:54,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, you know, got to wait to save up the money.

1844
02:07:56,330 --> 02:07:56,531
Okay.

1845
02:07:56,911 --> 02:07:57,131
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1846
02:07:57,151 --> 02:07:59,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Later, buddy.

[SPEAKER_07]: 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1848
02:08:04,115 --> 02:08:05,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't realize that call came in from Canada.

1849
02:08:05,816 --> 02:08:05,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1850

1851
02:08:38,769 --> 02:08:39,369
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Chortles.

1852
02:08:39,769 --> 02:08:40,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Chortles!

1853
02:08:40,669 --> 02:08:41,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi buddy, how are you?

1854
02:08:42,110 --> 02:08:42,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey.

1855
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:43,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's on your mind tonight?

1856
02:08:43,950 --> 02:08:44,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Chortles?

1857
02:08:44,830 --> 02:08:50,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, honestly, I was just considering, is it just me or is this your PlayStation?

1858
02:08:51,892 --> 02:08:52,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, let's put it this way.

1859
02:08:53,152 --> 02:09:04,595
[SPEAKER_12]: You know how Activision, is it true that on PlayStation Network, the publishers have to put out the servers themselves for the multiplayer?

1860
02:09:06,212 --> 02:09:07,635
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been considering that in the wake of...

1861
02:09:13,001 --> 02:09:19,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I'm not sure if I'm overhearing this, but basically, have you heard of reports about PlayStation Network getting hacked recently?

1862
02:09:20,426 --> 02:09:21,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, does that sound familiar to you?

1863
02:09:21,527 --> 02:09:23,368
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation Network's been getting hacked recently?

1864
02:09:23,768 --> 02:09:25,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't follow that stuff as well as he does.

1865
02:09:25,389 --> 02:09:25,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

1866
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:28,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure somebody's trying to hack it.

1867
02:09:28,692 --> 02:09:30,273
[SPEAKER_06]: The PlayStation 3's getting hacked, I guess.

1868
02:09:30,313 --> 02:09:34,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, which probably includes PlayStation Network and all this stuff with the Modern Warfare and so on.

1869
02:09:35,236 --> 02:09:36,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm sure you've heard that.

1870
02:09:38,518 --> 02:09:42,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to jump quickly back to your question about the whole central servers and who's really running them.

1871
02:09:43,081 --> 02:10:07,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I think to some extent the publishers are running I mean I don't know the ins and outs of games but like for example EA we just had a story on them a couple weeks ago that they were shutting down the servers for a bunch of old sports titles so I think they do run servers I think what Microsoft and PlayStation what they're running is kind of like the matchmaking and distribution services when you download upgrades and so forth that's coming from their servers because they're getting a cut of the profits

1872
02:10:07,629 --> 02:10:10,050
[SPEAKER_07]: DC Universe Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI

1873
02:10:27,199 --> 02:10:29,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess most people aren't looking to it for Final Fantasy XI.

1874
02:10:55,075 --> 02:11:05,844
[SPEAKER_12]: But the reason I was wondering that is because on the one hand, you know, you have the whole idea about, oh, you get... Yeah, go ahead.

1875
02:11:06,084 --> 02:11:06,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

1876
02:11:06,985 --> 02:11:12,890
[SPEAKER_12]: I just realized that I'm actually hearing what we just said previously for like a few seconds later as a background echo.

1877
02:11:12,910 --> 02:11:15,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Good old school first rule of calling into radio.

1878
02:11:15,052 --> 02:11:17,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn down your radio because it throws everybody off.

1879
02:11:17,273 --> 02:11:17,754
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all right.

1880
02:11:18,094 --> 02:11:18,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, fair enough, man.

1881
02:11:21,377 --> 02:11:22,518
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just considering that in...

1882
02:11:24,133 --> 02:11:36,839
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that Activision has the deal with Microsoft to have released the DLC first on 360, isn't that like for the next two Call of Duties at least as well?

1883
02:11:38,211 --> 02:11:45,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure the specifics of the agreement, but it's certainly not uncommon that one console gets download content that the other consoles don't get.

1884
02:11:45,278 --> 02:11:48,701
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, I think, buying exclusives for further.

1885
02:11:48,941 --> 02:11:50,362
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to cite another example?

1886
02:11:50,563 --> 02:11:54,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at what's going on with the PlayStation 3 and Portal 2, which we talked about in the Rapid Fire News earlier.

1887
02:11:54,546 --> 02:11:55,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I heard about that.

1888
02:11:55,687 --> 02:11:55,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the...

1889
02:11:56,468 --> 02:11:58,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Portal 2 coming to 360, by the way?

1890
02:11:58,750 --> 02:12:03,493
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, but Sony is really trying to do everything they can to make theirs.

1891
02:12:03,533 --> 02:12:08,377
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the quote from what they said at E3, the definitive version of Portal 2.

1892
02:12:09,978 --> 02:12:14,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, which is funny considering that that means free access to the other two versions.

1893
02:12:16,423 --> 02:12:22,488
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, to the home computer versions, which come to think of it, that's actually a business model I really like.

1894
02:12:22,908 --> 02:12:24,930
[SPEAKER_12]: You pay for the game once, and then...

1895
02:12:26,057 --> 02:12:32,839
[SPEAKER_12]: You have the game period in whichever way it's playable other than 360.

1896
02:12:33,220 --> 02:12:35,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that model too.

1897
02:12:35,460 --> 02:12:45,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you heard the guy earlier that called in saying that he's all about PC gaming now because consoles just aren't doing it for him and the games run better on his PC.

1898
02:12:45,424 --> 02:12:47,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he'd be frothing at the mouth about an idea like that.

1899
02:12:47,944 --> 02:12:52,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine buying Mass Effect 2 on the PlayStation and you get it on all consoles.

1900
02:12:52,586 --> 02:12:55,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, like, that would be my sort of thing.

1901
02:12:55,887 --> 02:12:59,088
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I could not get enough of that.

1902
02:12:59,328 --> 02:13:10,012
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's funny that he's revived his love of PC games, because, okay, I'll just let you know what I've been doing over the winter.

1903
02:13:10,412 --> 02:13:10,912
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically...

1904
02:13:12,541 --> 02:13:19,326
[SPEAKER_12]: I think one of the only games that I bought for a console in 2010 was Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

1905
02:13:19,946 --> 02:13:21,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Mind you, that was a launch game.

1906
02:13:21,727 --> 02:13:24,469
[SPEAKER_12]: It was immensely satisfying for a while.

1907
02:13:24,529 --> 02:13:25,850
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't regret that purchase.

1908
02:13:26,730 --> 02:13:27,191
[SPEAKER_12]: But then...

1909
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:34,234
[SPEAKER_12]: After a while, it petered out, especially when it came to trying to get good connectivity for the multiplayer.

1910
02:13:34,795 --> 02:13:42,102
[SPEAKER_12]: And while there were some severe issues with lag and multiplayer... The baby escaped.

1911
02:13:42,803 --> 02:13:45,145
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a baby in the background that appears to have escaped.

1912
02:13:47,688 --> 02:13:48,168
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I'm...

1913
02:13:49,958 --> 02:13:52,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, let me put it this way.

1914
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:56,103
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to pretend how she would know the word lag.

1915
02:13:56,223 --> 02:13:57,264
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to leave it at that.

1916
02:13:59,445 --> 02:14:01,066
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, can you get CPS on the line?

1917
02:14:01,106 --> 02:14:02,107
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1918
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:15,317
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry if this is boring everyone who's listening in, but basically I found that over the holidays, I was doing my Christmas shopping and...

1919
02:14:16,057 --> 02:14:21,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Unlike last year, I found that there wasn't much that I was looking for in the way of Steam.

1920
02:14:21,741 --> 02:14:25,883
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, yes, I know about the legendary Steam holiday and summer sales.

1921
02:14:26,264 --> 02:14:36,390
[SPEAKER_12]: I have partaken of them in past years, but this time I found that even though I was sitting on a nice chunk of change, I mainly just wanted to upgrade my hardware.

1922
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:37,371
[SPEAKER_12]: For example...

1923
02:14:39,022 --> 02:14:42,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, main thing that I changed is my video card.

1924
02:14:43,147 --> 02:14:48,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Originally, I was using onboard... I was using onboard video, don't ask.

1925
02:14:49,254 --> 02:14:54,501
[SPEAKER_12]: But as a result, basically this time around, I decided to upgrade to a...

1926
02:14:56,130 --> 02:15:01,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Radeon HD 5770 made by MSI, 1GB.

1927
02:15:02,353 --> 02:15:05,315
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a lot of the draw for me was the cooling.

1928
02:15:07,216 --> 02:15:09,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Like two fans, three heat pipes, a heat sink.

1929
02:15:10,258 --> 02:15:11,358
[SPEAKER_12]: It was pretty cool stuff.

1930
02:15:11,518 --> 02:15:14,420
[SPEAKER_12]: And so far, it seems to run all my games decently.

1931
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:20,943
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's really about, I think with the PC, it's really about the hardware and making the right choices with that.

1932
02:15:21,003 --> 02:15:23,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you invest with that, you're going to get a huge payback.

1933
02:15:23,344 --> 02:15:29,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know I upgraded my video card last year so I could run Warcraft better, which is the only PC game I need to be playing.

1934
02:15:29,707 --> 02:15:30,787
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

1935
02:15:31,007 --> 02:15:31,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no, no.

1936
02:15:31,507 --> 02:15:35,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I've played World of Warcraft for a long time.

1937
02:15:36,370 --> 02:15:41,232
[SPEAKER_12]: I took the weak trial for Cataclysm, but I'm not paying for that right now.

1938
02:15:41,992 --> 02:15:46,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, I will give this advice to anyone who plays World of Warcraft.

1939
02:15:47,277 --> 02:15:54,203
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if you take a break in the form of, like, canceling your subscription or not playing a while, get the Battle.net authenticator.

1940
02:15:54,583 --> 02:15:59,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, if you don't already have it and you use a smartphone, just get the mobile authenticator.

1941
02:15:59,727 --> 02:16:02,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you don't want people using your account while you're not there.

1942
02:16:02,590 --> 02:16:06,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I've actually had that happen to me in, like, in the summer of 2010.

1943
02:16:06,193 --> 02:16:06,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Like...

1944
02:16:08,490 --> 02:16:14,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Two weeks after my subscription ran out, boom, my account was hacked.

1945
02:16:14,652 --> 02:16:18,373
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of stuff got stolen.

1946
02:16:18,833 --> 02:16:23,735
[SPEAKER_12]: My all-time highest level item got jacked.

1947
02:16:24,355 --> 02:16:32,178
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the time I found out, got my account unhacked and got back into World of Warcraft.

1948
02:16:33,119 --> 02:16:35,280
[SPEAKER_12]: It was too late for Blizzard to recover my stuff.

1949
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:39,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and it's a story I have heard way, way, way too many times.

1950
02:16:39,744 --> 02:16:44,607
[SPEAKER_07]: But Chortles, I gotta wrap up and let you go because if I keep letting you talking, pretty soon they're gonna give you our time slot.

1951
02:16:44,647 --> 02:16:46,168
[SPEAKER_07]: So I gotta wrap up and let you go.

1952
02:16:46,729 --> 02:16:47,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Find the baby!

1953
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:51,953
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll probably be more focused next time, I suppose.

1954
02:16:52,033 --> 02:16:54,094
[SPEAKER_12]: That baby has walked out the front door by now.

1955
02:16:54,154 --> 02:16:54,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Go get him.

1956
02:16:54,875 --> 02:16:55,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1957
02:16:55,335 --> 02:16:55,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, alright.

1958
02:16:55,856 --> 02:16:56,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, bye.

1959
02:16:59,264 --> 02:17:00,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chortles, for that call.

1960
02:17:01,245 --> 02:17:02,565
[SPEAKER_07]: He was just really happy to be here.

1961
02:17:03,545 --> 02:17:04,626
[SPEAKER_07]: He sounded happy.

1962
02:17:04,746 --> 02:17:05,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I like enthusiasm.

1963
02:17:06,566 --> 02:17:07,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Brains.

1964
02:17:07,087 --> 02:17:08,227
[SPEAKER_07]: He was just enthusiastic.

1965
02:17:08,487 --> 02:17:08,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Brains.

1966
02:17:09,867 --> 02:17:11,668
[SPEAKER_07]: You're saying it was a zombie baby in the background?

1967
02:17:11,708 --> 02:17:11,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1968
02:17:12,488 --> 02:17:12,748
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1969
02:17:13,309 --> 02:17:13,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Be nice.

1970
02:17:13,629 --> 02:17:15,449
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1971
02:17:15,489 --> 02:17:16,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for calling us.

1972
02:17:17,030 --> 02:17:19,290
[SPEAKER_07]: If you didn't get through tonight, please consider sending us an email.

1973
02:17:19,691 --> 02:17:23,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails to.

1974
02:17:24,312 --> 02:17:25,372
[SPEAKER_07]: We would really appreciate it.

1975
02:17:25,993 --> 02:17:26,333
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1976
02:17:27,765 --> 02:17:29,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's wrap up the show.

1977
02:17:29,726 --> 02:17:30,187
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done.

1978
02:17:30,247 --> 02:17:31,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any other last-minute stories we've got to get out?

1979
02:17:31,888 --> 02:17:32,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Ribbons and bows, Rob.

1980
02:17:32,608 --> 02:17:33,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Ribbons and bows.

1981
02:17:33,869 --> 02:17:34,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Spank it on the butt.

1982
02:17:34,830 --> 02:17:35,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It's done.

1983
02:17:36,151 --> 02:17:36,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Slack.

1984
02:17:36,911 --> 02:17:37,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I have nothing.

1985
02:17:37,772 --> 02:17:38,072
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1986
02:17:38,212 --> 02:17:40,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1987
02:17:40,374 --> 02:17:42,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll start with Loki tonight.

1988
02:17:42,415 --> 02:17:43,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

1989
02:17:43,816 --> 02:17:46,678
[SPEAKER_06]: My sound card decides when it decides to work and not.

1990
02:17:48,239 --> 02:17:49,000
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't like that.

1991
02:17:50,221 --> 02:17:54,464
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is I took Friday off, so yay for four-day work week next week.

1992
02:17:54,484 --> 02:17:54,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

1993
02:17:55,762 --> 02:17:56,765
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, you have a final thought?

1994
02:17:57,668 --> 02:17:58,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Reject false icons

1995
02:17:59,492 --> 02:18:01,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, you going old school.

1996
02:18:01,393 --> 02:18:01,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

1997
02:18:01,854 --> 02:18:03,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't expect you to whip that out until episode 400.

1998
02:18:04,656 --> 02:18:05,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me whip this out.

1999
02:18:07,137 --> 02:18:08,218
[SPEAKER_07]: She's just getting warmed up.

2000
02:18:08,458 --> 02:18:09,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2001
02:18:09,319 --> 02:18:11,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm warming up my bitch slapping hand.

2002
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:12,241
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2003
02:18:13,221 --> 02:18:16,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting independent podcasting.

2004
02:18:16,283 --> 02:18:17,804
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we don't play commercials.

2005
02:18:17,864 --> 02:18:21,207
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't ram, you know, stuff we're trying to sell down your throat.

2006
02:18:21,547 --> 02:18:24,169
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like the show, all we ask, tell friends about the show.

2007
02:18:24,189 --> 02:18:25,209
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll ram other things down your throat.

2008
02:18:25,229 --> 02:18:25,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Shh, stop.

2009
02:18:26,270 --> 02:18:26,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Like candy.

2010
02:18:29,652 --> 02:18:33,353
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura's like, I got a lollipop.

2011
02:18:33,413 --> 02:18:34,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to do a plug.

2012
02:18:34,213 --> 02:18:36,334
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very important plug I'm trying to do here, DarkSakura.

2013
02:18:36,354 --> 02:18:37,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop derailing me with your toilet humor.

2014
02:18:37,574 --> 02:18:38,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you plugging it already?

2015
02:18:38,594 --> 02:18:38,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop it.

2016
02:18:39,975 --> 02:18:45,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Go on to iTunes or whatever favorite podcast site you use and leave us a nice review.

2017
02:18:45,176 --> 02:18:46,296
[SPEAKER_07]: We would really appreciate it.

2018
02:18:46,356 --> 02:18:48,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Five-star reviews on iTunes helps go a long way to promote

2019
02:18:48,877 --> 02:19:01,922
[SPEAKER_07]: tell your friends about the show tell people you think would be interested in people talking about video games and giving folks a voice and hearing people call in and just talk about games they really like that's it

2020
02:19:02,389 --> 02:19:03,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell your kids, tell your wife.

2021
02:19:03,870 --> 02:19:04,331
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

2022
02:19:04,491 --> 02:19:06,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And tell your husbands because we're gaming everybody out there.

2023
02:19:07,353 --> 02:19:08,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, I think.

2024
02:19:08,754 --> 02:19:09,895
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's going to do it for another week.

2025
02:19:10,235 --> 02:19:12,477
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be back next week to do it all again.

2026
02:19:13,317 --> 02:19:14,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so excited.

2027
02:19:14,338 --> 02:19:14,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't hide it.

2028
02:19:14,979 --> 02:19:15,619
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next week.

2029
