George Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
With your hosts

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Dark Sakura

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Sky and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, January 2nd, 2011

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
A popular SoCal arcade prepares to shut its doors

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
A hype Japanese release underperforms

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
And a classic Super Nintendo RPG makes its way to mobile phones

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
We are that show where every gamer has a voice

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Over the next few hours, we'll be talking to you about video games

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
And gaming culture, gaming lifestyle, all that fun stuff

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
A new year here at Orange Lounge Radio

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Our ninth year, if you can believe it, of broadcasting

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
From 2002 to 2011

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
My name is Rob Roberts

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
And with me, as always, as she has been for nine damn years

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I hate that damn dragon

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
We're gonna get to that in a minute because everything, like, changed

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
It's like, it's like a new, is it technically a new decade now that it's 2011?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Yes

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay, so like, new decade, everything changed

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Seriously, I'm gonna get to that in a minute

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Nothing's changed, I brought this

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Tech master Loki over there, interjecting his opinion, yes

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Yes, Tech Master Loki?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes, I brought soup a few weeks ago

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Remember, I had two large soups, I'm like, look, I have two soups

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
But tonight you brought four soups

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Well, it wasn't intentional, I only wanted two

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Instead of two large soups, he has four smaller soups

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Which I think is still more soup than the, you know, it was before

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Alright, and that's value

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Now, I do have to introduce, always with us, the fourth guest on the show

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Officially is our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Or we are on the IRC network on Game Surge

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
If you find that, gamesurge.net

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
And we are in channel Orange Lounge

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
If you want to do that, the real easy way, just go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
But we do sometimes have guests in studio with us

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Just to hang out and have some fun with us

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Say hello to Gary is back tonight

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Happy New Year

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
How are you doing, Gary?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I'm doing alright

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
You haven't been here in a few months

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I seem to remember the last time you were here

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Loki was out, so you were kind of a fill-in hosty type deal

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah, something like that

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
You're back tonight to kick off the new year with us here at OLR

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
We were off for the holiday break and all the December events that were going on

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
DarkSakura loaded her car and went up to Washington

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
How was your Washington trip, by the way?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
That fun, huh?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
It was alright, it was very...

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
I watched a lot of the DIY network

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
And Chiller, because they had a Buffy marathon

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Doesn't Chiller also run the Twin Peaks episodes?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I have no idea, because I don't have cable

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
When did you watch on DIY?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
House Movers, that was pretty cool

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
And I watched a lot of the home repair ones

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
I learned the quick way to add in drywall

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Here comes Dan the man, the husband of DarkSakura, always present here

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Am I on here?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Yes, you're on

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Before you listen to her bitch about it, she also got to drink ridiculously expensive wine

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I did

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
And she got completely smashed with my dad, which was hilarious

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Your dad kept pouring me the wine

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
And you kept drinking it

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
And so did he

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Anyway

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
And then he got an inversion table, so I'm drunk and upside down

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
It was kinkier than it sounds, with my dad

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Shut up!

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
You are a bastard

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Indeed

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
He was a smooth pimp

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
So before you let her go, oh, it sucked and I was bored

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I didn't say it sucked

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
She had a good time

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
She got to sleep the whole way there in the back

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I saw her vlogs, they were entertaining

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
DarkSakura is a vlogger now, with her little phones-y

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
And disturbing

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And then Dan sitting there in the background like, hey, I'm Dan

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
I talked more on a couple that we didn't upload

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh, bummer

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Okay, well, I'm out of here

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Alright, take care, Dan

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
So yeah, we do occasionally talk about video games here on Orange Laundry Radio

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Video games, what the fuck?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Since it is a new year, let me just kind of reset the stage for everybody

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
If we happen to have any new listeners

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
So we're hitting the reset button real quick

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Tell you a little bit about Orange Laundry Radio

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Orange Laundry Radio started in 2002

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
I have a college radio background and DarkSakura and I used to do stuff with another show called

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
Undersedation Live, which is still up and running on the All Games Network on Saturday nights

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
But we decided to start a show that was kind of talking smack about video games

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
And what I mean by that is that DarkSakura, myself, and Loki

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
We actually all met at a arcade locally here

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Playing, believe it or not, Dance Dance Revolution

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
We used to be obsessed with that game

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I was never skinnier

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Oh, no, no, no, Rob, Rob

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
For us, it was Parapara

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
A little bit of that, too, and Beatmania

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
And a lot of those music-based video games

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
So for a very long time, before there was even podcasting

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
We had a show on Live 365 dedicated to music games

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
And the music from them and so forth

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
So things have evolved, podcasting happened

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
And, you know, music games kind of faded out

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Then they came back in a different way

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
And now they're kind of going, you know, things go up and down

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
And kamami said no one would like them

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, so anyway, we're here

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Silly, silly people

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
We're talking about kind of the rest of the video games

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Of course, we still have a fondness for music video games

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
But we talk about role-playing games

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Meat

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Even first-person shooters

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
And meat

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
We might get to tonight

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
And of course

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Meat

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Food games

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Iron Chef, for we

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I'm going to make a sandwich in a moment

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
And I'm going to make a turkey and cranberry sandwich

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
And it's going to be amazing

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
The secret ingredient, Iron Chef, the game is suck

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
All right, anyhow

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
So that's our little show

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
So welcome, thanks for joining us

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
And of course, we do plug ourselves as the show

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Where every gamer has a voice

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
And we do mean that, you know, this show was started with a bunch of us

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Kind of sitting around after a night at the arcade

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
We used to go to this little restaurant called Brookfield's

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
That was in the parking lot of the arcade where we all played at

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
And we would have

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Old people food

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Well, but awesome mozzarella sticks

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
So we'd always kind of dine on mozzarella sticks

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And talk smack about the games we just played

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
So that's kind of what we try to emulate here

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Via our chat room, via the Skype line, via Twitter, via email

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Via Carrier Pigeon, if you can figure out how to get one here

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Rick's Glass of Merlot

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
All right, anyhow

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Let's talk about games and your gaming week

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
We were off last week because of Decemberween or whatever

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Yeah, Decemberween

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Whatever it is you celebrate

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Festivus, Christmas, Kwanzaa, all of it

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
All of it was an excuse to have last week off

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, I played a lot

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
Actually, I played a lot of Mushihime Sama Bug Panic

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Thank you so much, Loki

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
That game is so freaking fun

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
And seriously, it's like mix of cave shooter and an adventure game

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
And it's bullet hell on feet

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
It's fun, it's super fun

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
And so I played a ton of that

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
And I feel dirty

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I feel dirty, Rob

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Why? Why do you feel dirty?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Wow

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
DarkSakura started playing World of Warcraft

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Oh my god, you guys

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
It's like a total turnaround from her stance two weeks ago

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
And I gained 30 levels in four days

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Okay, so before everybody starts yelling at you

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Scab defector, you suck

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
What is it, what's the magic that's there now that wasn't there for you last time?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
More to do

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Shut up

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
You get the hell out

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
You get the hell out

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You are not on, no, no

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I'd like to give an F you to Rob

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
For the whole fucking Warcraft thing

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I'm not having it in my house

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
She can play for a while

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Then she's gonna get all addicted

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
And I'm gonna get a fucking divorce

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
It's your fault, Rob

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
It's not my fault

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I'm gonna kill you

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Tiara plays too, blame her

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I don't like Tiara, oh I like her

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
You can get the hell out

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Should we call the police right now?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
There's about to be a domestic disturbance

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
At least it's all captured

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Here on the radio

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Dan was in here doing the happy dance

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
While I blithely flipped him off

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Alright

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
It was funny

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
It has more to do now, I guess

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Keep in mind, I love Star Trek Online

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I freaking love it

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
But I was running out of stuff to do

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I was seriously getting bored

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
And they'd put in episodes

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
And I would just wait and do

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
All of the portions of the episode

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
At once, and then I would be done with it

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
And I'm like, okay, what do I do now?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
And even some of the missions are now broken

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
And as much fun as I was having

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I was like, I'm kinda done

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
What more can I do?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
So I thought that the changes were really exciting

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
But really all I ever do is go in there

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Talk to my friends and play Dabo

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
That's it

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
So I was like, you know

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
The door of opportunity swung open

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
So I gave it a try

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Even after I was damn determined to play this game

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Because it did not want me to

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I defied

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Every power

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
That tried to prevent me from playing this game

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Meaning?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Meaning that my stupid

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
The loader.exe was reading

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Badly with Windows

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
So I had to rename it Bob

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
And then it worked

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
No seriously, I tried every freaking thing

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I ran safe mode with networking

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I did all of this crap

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
And finally I'm like, fuck you, I'm naming you Bob

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
And it worked

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Wasn't there a program back in the day called Microsoft Bob?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I have no idea

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Isn't that like the reason we have Comic Sans in the world now?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Ooh, yeah

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
By the way, I've gotta go to our chat room

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
You know they are the always present guests here on the show

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
They're not allowed to talk

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Black Wolf, addict

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Act Deft, sell out

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Bojigawa, addict

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Jesus, let's just pop in our chat room

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I was fine with my spouse's

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Sleeping pill and QVC addiction

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
But I will not abide World of Warcraft in this marriage

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Wow

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Well I think, is he trying to say that you're addicted

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Alan Hart

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Is he trying to say that you're addicted to sleeping pills and QVC?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I am not

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Dan admitted to me earlier today

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
That he used to stay up late

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
In his high school years

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Watching the Home Shopping Network

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
What other good shit about

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I was in fifth grade

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And I stayed up all night watching Home Shopping Network

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Because I was up late

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And it made me feel like somebody was up with me

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
So I wouldn't be lonely

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Pathetic, huh?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
And it's hilarious because they're so stupid

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I love watching them sell a computer

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
You press this button

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And it does stuff

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
It comes with a free printer

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Didn't know your show was going to be a confessional tonight

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I know, it's like

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
We're cleaning the slate for New Years

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It's a confessional tonight on Orange Lounge Radio

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Get everything off your chest

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
So that this new decade

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Can be a relieving one

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Amen to that

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
But, well I am going to say

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
That I have now made it from

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
One side of the continent

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
To the other

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
On whatever freaking continent that is that you took me to

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Actually, first of all

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
You took me to this giant tree

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And then I jumped off, died

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
And then respawned at the bottom of the tree

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
So that I wouldn't have to figure out how to get off of it

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
And then just ran across the water

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And then I've been

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Running all over the continent

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
And it's been kind of fun because I've actually kind of

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Been getting into the story

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
And getting into the lore of the game

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
It's been, now that I'm actually

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Getting to see more of the story

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Because that was one of the big things that I liked about Star Trek Online

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
As I was going through

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
All of the ranks and stuff

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
You get more of the story and I was like

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Well it's really fitting in well with Star Trek Universe

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
And then I just got to this point like

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
What? Why are we fighting the Davidians?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
They were the lamest

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Brain sucking

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Interdimensional creatures ever

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
It really

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Except that they gave me the cool Silent Hill thing

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
So that was cool but

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I accidentally ran into an instance and got killed

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
That has to happen at least once I think

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
It was the one that was underwater

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Like with all the underwater people

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Sounds like Black Fathom depths

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
That was it

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
That was it

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Oh it's sad I know that

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
And now I'm in some place called the Battle Scar

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
And I couldn't find the damn flag

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And then I just gained a level

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Congrats, so what level are you now?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I know you're gonna do it

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
37

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
In a row?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
But I think I've done okay

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
For myself because I've gotten there

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
In technically

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Six days of playing

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Right?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
You've been jamming right along

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Bochi Kawa in our chatroom says

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Everyone jumps off of Teladrasil, it's normal

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Is it like the Golden Gate?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Lumi's in our chatroom says

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I hope we have another

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I Slept with a Forum Troll reveal

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I don't know

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Gary, have you ever slept with a forum troll?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
No

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Well we had a guest a couple weeks ago that

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Apparently had so

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
The only thing that forum trolls

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Are fit for is machine gun targets

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Alright

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Seriously though

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
But I got a melodica

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Which has nothing to do with games but I love Marisa forever

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Would you learn how to play Still Alive on the melodica

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
And play it for us one night?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Wow that was random

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I could probably figure it out over the course of the show

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
That's okay we don't need to hear you rehearsing

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Throughout the next three hours

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
If you have nothing else gaming to report

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
No I did other stuff

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I remember so fucking

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
We've had a bunch of maim going on in the front room all day

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
I heard they were playing Moonwalker when we got here

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Because all I could hear was

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
No no wait I had to go

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Ouch

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
And yeah

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
They've had the maim fest going on

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
And Dan has a new steering wheel

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
For Gran Turismo 5

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I'm never gonna call

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Wow Player an addict again

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I'm gonna call Dan an addict

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
It's a Bobby Blackpool

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Joke

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Bobby is convinced that Gran Turismo 5 is not out

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Because he's not seen it on a store shelf anywhere

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
But your husband somehow has it

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
You know what I can verify that it is out

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Because sometimes I hear Dan yelling at it

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
That though

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
And the biggest thing that I'm gonna give it

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Is that it has the top gear track

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
And it has the Stig

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
So it's instantly

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
In my cool book forever

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Because I freaking love the Stig

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
He listens to all kinds of interesting music

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
And he may or may not be an alien

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Okay

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Let's go to Loki

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Loki how was your gaming week?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
It was okay

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I didn't play a whole lot

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Just playing the same stuff

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I've been working on Grand Theft Auto stuff

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Just doing construction stuff

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
With the mods

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Then also of course

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I've been playing some

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
iPod games

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Including

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Some of these aren't exactly new

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Actually most of these aren't new

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
But they're very similar types of games

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Cannibalt and I Must Run

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Both actually pretty much similar to Cannibalt

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Based off the Flash game

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Where you run and have to jump over pits

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And stuff like that without dying

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
And keeps getting faster and faster

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I Must Run they try to add kind of a story to it

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And it's kind of neat

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And I like the presentation of it

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
It's like some time traveling game

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
That sort of reminds me of the art style

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Of like Feel the Magic

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
So that's kind of cool

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And then

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Also played

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
More Swords and Poker 2

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Which unfortunately is not on

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
The app store anymore

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
The first one, Swords and Poker 1

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
But thankfully though

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I have a jailbroken iPod

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
So I don't have that problem

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And I'm glad

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Because those games are very addicting

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
And then also

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I don't know if you noticed

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
But there was

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Some new stuff actually coming on

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
The app store

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It was pretty cool

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
They had one of the

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Tails games actually

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Is now on the app store

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
So if you're a fan of that series

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
You might want to check that out

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
It was a Super NES Tails game

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It was

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Let's see here

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Which Tails game was it?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Tails

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I guess

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Tails of Weaver

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Lucian Cult

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
But I guess it's based on the MMORPG

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
But it looks like

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
A nice 16-bit RPG

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
You know

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I will say even though you've been kind of slowly

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Going this way over the past six months

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Maybe the biggest change for 2011 isn't the fact

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
That Loki is not bringing bacon

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Pizza to the show but the fact that

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I would have never said two years ago

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
That Loki would be the one here reviewing games that are out on the

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
iTouch

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Call me crazy but if you've listened to Loki's

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Diatribes in the past on Apple

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I've already told you though

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I understand

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It's still a little bizarre

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
It's max not the i things

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
See the i things

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
They are expensive but they're good

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
And the max

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
The max are fucking expensive

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
They're not good

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
You don't get very good value for what you

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Purchase

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I would hope that if I'm spending $2,000

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
On a laptop that I'm getting something

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
More than just one USB drive

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I don't care if it's paper thin

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I want a fucking computer that can do something

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
That's just my opinion

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
But hey you know what

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Teach their own and some people will buy

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Max stuff forever and honestly

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I spent no money on this

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I had a stupid gift card that they gave me

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
It was either that or

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Buying a bunch of Apple TV's

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
That throw out a window or something

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I will say that max are still

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Great for the graphics but now

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
That Adobe's figured out that

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
There's really a lot of PC users out there

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I have no need

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
To have a Mac anymore

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
They have pretty monitors

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
But those monitors have their old

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
God I want one of those gorgeous

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Gigantor monitors

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh my god that would be so amazing

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I would need new underwear every day

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
They're pretty nice

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Our graphics department has

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Some of those and they're nice

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
But once again it's a monitor

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
And I'm sure that monitor is way overpriced

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
For what it is

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
So I just

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I could buy a TV and hook it up

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And it would cost less than the monitor

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
See like I have my

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
iPod which I can browse the web

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And stuff if I have a wifi spot

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
And I have my phone which you know I can

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Browse the web too with that but honestly

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I hate my phone's web browser

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
It's terrible and it's

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Slow

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I have an Android phone

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
But it's

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
It's a virgin mobile prepaid

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Android phone

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I don't think it's like a super android

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Android that plays snake

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Yes

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
But it is an

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Android that I was able to root and

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Add a thing to

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Allow me to tether

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
To it so I just tether this

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
To it and I'm able to browse the web

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And I love it and it's great

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
And I use this actually a lot now

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
To you know browse the web and check

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
My mail or whatever instead of

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Having to go to my computer boot it up and do

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
All that stuff and then just it's a lot

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Quicker I just do it on here

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
But see that's the only thing I have I like going for

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
It cause I mean this is

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Arguably the top

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
There's no I mean Zune's

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
They're alright but there's no

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Yes but there's no like

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
You know there's not really

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Any iPod

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Competitors out there that are kind of close to it right now

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Can't say the same though for Max

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Max I'm sorry it's just there's

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
There's competitors everywhere and they're just beating the

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Crap out of them

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Other computers are you know they've

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Gotten the form factor really small but

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I'm sorry it's just

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
That's not important to me

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
So Loki would you say

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
The description of a Mac is an overpriced fashion

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Accessory true or false

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Or something else

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
They buy into the brand and not

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Necessarily it's for people

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
They've

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Kind of marketed them as PCs

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
They're easy to use or laptops

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
They're easy to use and it's they're kind of

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
People don't want to try to

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Learn stuff and they trust the

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Apple brand because it's been around forever

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
And unfortunately people are willing

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
To spend a lot of money for that

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
This is the impression I get and I'm probably going to piss some

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Mac fans off but you know oh well

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I had an Apple

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Laptop it only lasted me a year but

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I had it but anyway

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I kind of get the sense that

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Apple a lot of their systems

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Why I don't know why we've turned into this Mac versus PC

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
War but

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Really preference I mean if you want to buy one

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Go ahead but Macs are kind of like PC

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Consoles to me and I think sometimes that's the

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Advantage of them is that a lot of the software is

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Very much customized for the Mac

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Because their library is

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
A little more limited than what you see on the PC

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
And the expandability and

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Customizability well yes I understand you can do some

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Of it with Apple they're not all over the

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Fucking map like PCs are like

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
There's zillions and zillions of

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Different types of PCs but there's only so many types

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Of Macs and I think the software

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
By nature kind of is

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
A little more optimized and runs a little better

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
On Macs the app store coming to the Mac

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Is a great idea because

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
You know at least then you have a lot of

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Different programs and tools and stuff that people

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Can just fill

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Their computer with like I have with my

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
iPod so

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I think that's a good idea and they'll really fit with it

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
But once again it's basically just

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Like hey look it's just a more expensive

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
iPad or something now it's a computer

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
iPad you know

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I don't know it's just but iPads

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Are so cute last time I used

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Anything from Apple it crashed on me

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I don't know

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Alright well let's get let's get off the Apple

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
PC stuff and continue with our gaming

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Weeks I don't know if Loki has anything else

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
But if no just grant them though but I don't we

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Don't need well what else is new let's go over to

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Gary what types of video games you've been

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Playing lately

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Well Dark Sakura's husband's been

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Kicking my ass thoroughly on Street Fighter

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
For Super Turbo

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Yes well

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
That goes without saying I just started

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Playing it thank you I just said that

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I can't that he can't help that he's

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Not good at it that's because I haven't played it

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Since I was in junior high thank you

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And I've

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Also yeah yeah yeah

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I also just started playing Batman Arkham

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Asylum finally

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Which the graphics are wow

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
And yeah

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I know I'm trying to come lately to that party but

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It's still something I haven't

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Attached the game oh okay

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Well I feel a little bit better but still

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
It's a fun

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Game I'm told that you can beat it in about

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Eight hours if you if you're dedicated but

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I'll drag it out and enjoy it

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
As long as I can so

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
But yeah I

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Recently acquired an Xbox 360

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So and that's been

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
That's been a lot of fun

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
And I'm quite impressed I also got a

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
A Samsung

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Phone with windows on

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
It and I noticed it has the Xbox Live

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Application

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I have yet to go through the catalog

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
And see what games are available to download

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I think I saw Tetris as one of them

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
That's been a big thing they're pushing lately is that the

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Whole achievements from your phone and all that

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Pretty good

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
You know what's kind of cool and I kind of

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Off subject here real quick but we were talking about

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Oh I was talking about my phone

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
One thing I like and this is something

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
That I wish that they would do with like

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Steam and stuff is the Android

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Marketplace say you buy an

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
App or something like from them and it either

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Sucks or it doesn't work

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
You can get your money back

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And uninstall

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Nice yes I mean

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
That's awesome

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
They should really have that

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I haven't paid for any apps on this

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
On the windows phone yet the only ones I've got

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I've downloaded were free so

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
But you know we'll see what happens

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
With that I like it so far

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
But

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Time will tell the battery doesn't last

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
For anything but I'm told that's normal

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah with a lot of smart phones

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
They don't always last very long

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
My iPhone lasts forever

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Well the more you're online the more you do

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
The GPS enabled stuff

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Of course that's all going to be a battery drain

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
So you just want to make sure you're not running anything in the background

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
We were running the MP3 players

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
From here to Washington and didn't lose

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
And didn't use up the whole battery

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Surprisingly enough MP3 really doesn't use that much battery

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
And I was

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Using and Facebooking the entire way too

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
It only uses up a lot of battery

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
If you continuously skip through songs

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I've noticed if you just let it play

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Yeah it'll go forever

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
So

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Well anything else for your gaming week you wish to share with us Gary?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Oh just

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
A lot of tabletop D&D

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Ah that's right

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
You're into the old school types of games

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Not really old school

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
But I like me some Final Fantasy 2

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And I've got a hold of Final Fantasy 13

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
And haven't had a chance to start it yet

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Because I'm still one thing at a time

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And for the tabletop fans out there

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Because I know there's always a few

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
There's always a little bit of crossover between the video gaming circles and tabletop gaming circles

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
What are your tabletop games of choice right now?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Um

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I was playing

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I've been playing D&D since 2000

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
So I'm kind of getting burnt out on fantasy

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I'm looking at Hero System

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I'm looking at Mutants and Masterminds

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
From Green Ronin

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Which just recently released

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
A DC Heroes

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Roleplaying game based on the Mutants and Masterminds system

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Last fall

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
And they're going to put out the third edition of Mutants and Masterminds

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Very very shortly

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I haven't only gotten to play it once or twice

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
But I'm told by people who have played it

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
It's an awesome system

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I have a little bit more experience with Hero

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Which is a lot more complicated

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Alright

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Speaking of DC there's a big new game coming out soon

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
The DC Universe Online is out in about

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
One, two weeks

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
From that it looks awesome

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Yeah I've played the beta on the PC

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
It's good times

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
It's a little bit like if Ninja Turtles was an MMO

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Because it is a lot of beat-em-up

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
It does come with a month of free play

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Well that's customary, of course

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
So we'll see

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I'll have to look into that one

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Alright

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Well anyway, my gaming week

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I want to talk about a few things with my gaming week

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I'm kind of like Gary

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I was kicking it old school a little bit

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I wanted to buy two used games and get one free

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
One of them isn't old

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I bought Tron Evolution

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Which is the game that came out

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
To support the new Tron movie, Tron Legacy

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I bought that on the Playstation 3

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And I played this at E3 and I was somewhat

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Encouraged by what I saw

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
With the whole Prince of Persia style fighting

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
And you know

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I was seeing the light bike races

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
On another screen, although that ended up really being

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
The Wii version

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
So I played the Tron game

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And it sucks, I hate it

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I'm really disappointed because

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Tron deserves a better game than this

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
And I'm sorry to say it

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
It was clearly

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Clearly rushed to make

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
The movie release

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
And this shit always happens with games based on movies

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And that's why none of them are ever any good

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I should say, rarely are they good

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
And unfortunately it just falls in that same bin

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Where the best part about it was the

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Daft Punk soundtrack in the beginning

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
It's hard to hear that

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Because it deserves better

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
And there's so much more they could do with the Tron mythos

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
I will say this, the story

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Is kind of the coolest part

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
And what I liked is that some of it

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Would parallel scenes in the movie

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
And without giving it all away

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Because I don't want to tell you about the whole plot

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
But I will say it's supposed to

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Explain what happened between the first movie

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
And the new movie

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
And the new movie does some of that flashback as well

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
So there is overlap

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
With the flashback scene which you see in the movie

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And what you play in the game

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Honestly, I think I'm just going to go on YouTube

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
And try to find a compilation of all the cut scenes from the game

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
There will be more Tron games

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
It's inevitable

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I wish they'd be better

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
This is what ruined the game for me

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
What absolutely ruined the game for me

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Was in one sequence

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I finally got through the first level

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
And I got to the sequence where you're on light bikes

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
And I was like, fuck yes!

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I get to do the light bike races

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Because that was one of the coolest fucking things in the movie

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I'm doing spirals and up the hills

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Yeah, you know

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
And I'm doing the light bikes and they control

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Like, butt

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
And I crashed my light cycle

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I shit you not, like seven times

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
And the whole acceleration, deceleration

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Doesn't really flow

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
And there's this part where you are supposed to do this big jump

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
But if you haven't accelerated enough

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You don't make the jump

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I'm literally sitting there going

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Did anybody play this game

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
To see if it was fun

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Because it's not fun

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
And that is so frustrating

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Because it's Tron

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
It's fucking Tron

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
And it deserves to be so much better

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I was so mad

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
I will tell you this

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Do not, do not spend $60 on this game

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Do spend 99 cents on the iPhone game

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
That's out there because it's a better experience

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Dude, I have that, it's great

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
That was the other thing that I was trying to remember when I played

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
That game is fun

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
But you did see the movie, right?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I fucking love the movie

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Well you know that they're doing it twice

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
They're doing like a Clone Wars thing with it

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Where they're going to have an animated series

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
That's going to be between the first and second movies

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Yeah, that sounds interesting

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
You should totally read the comics by the way

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
The Tron, the betrayal

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
They're really good

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I wonder if there's any overlap with that in the game as well

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
But let me tell you, here's some of my problems with the game you guys

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Because you know, I'm sitting here when it stinks

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
The thing is that

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
A lot of the combat feels like really repetitive

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
And there's some frame rate issues

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
When like, you know, you're throwing the disc

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
It just kind of seems to like

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Bounce all over the screen in random frames

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
The multiplayer

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Like, what would you think multiplayer would be in Tron?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
What would you think would be the first thing

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
You're going to go into in a multiplayer in Tron?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Anybody?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Don't you think? No

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Nope, it's a battle arena

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
It's not the disc thing, it's just 20 people

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
In a big clusterfuck arena

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
All de-rezzing each other

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
There were no light cycles up front

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Not that I could find easily

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I could have sworn I read it's like in there

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
But I was like cycling, I don't know if it's something you have to buy

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Later on or what

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
But I was cycling through the stuff

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
I didn't find that mode to play

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
So either I'm a complete moron or the game was not well designed

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Because I could not find it

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Because I'm thinking, if you're trying to sell a game to Tron fans

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
You would put that light cycle, the tanks

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
All that shit would be front and center

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
You know what I mean? And it's not

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I went into this ultra lame

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
20 people all throwing discs at each other

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Or the light jets

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
That would have been cool

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Or the little mosquito looking guys in the movie

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
It was awesome

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Wyland in our chatroom says

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Play a real Tron game, play 2.0

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
You know what? I've heard a lot of good things

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
About that game and I probably should

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
You're probably right

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I was going to ask you about that

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Were there any other Tron games that came out before the movie?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Besides 2.0?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Just Tron 2.0

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
That I know of

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
And that's not counting any fan stuff

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Because the Tron sequel has been in development

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
For quite some time

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
From what I understand

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
So there's been an absence of Tron things

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I mean not counting

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Xbox Live Marketplace

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Had rehashes of the Tron

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I don't think you can get them anymore

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Because of license issues

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
If you don't count that

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
This is where it gets awesome

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Tron deadly discs

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
And Wyland just wants to say

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Yeah 2.0 is far far better

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Than evolution

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
And Tigerclaw says Sky light cycles are in there

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I think it's the RB button that puts you in light cycle mode

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Well I mean I know light cycles

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Were like in the game but is it multiplayer?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Because when I was like circling around the different arenas

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
It was all different types of

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Melee

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
So whatever I mean

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Call me an idiot if you want

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
But the fact that I couldn't find that very easy

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I think speaks for itself

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Yeah

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Anyhow

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Unfortunately if you must

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Rent Tron for the story

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Do not do not spend 50 or 60 dollars

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Just go to the Tron wiki

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I've already read the whole thing on the Tron wiki

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Well I mean it's nice to see it

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Like it's fun to see the movie

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Rent it

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
It's at most worth a $5 rental

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
And you could probably play through it a weekend

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Or

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Most red boxes nowadays do have game rentals

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
As well you can rent it for one day

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
For like two bucks

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
There you go

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
From what you were saying that sounds like about all it's worth

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
So I'm gonna move up the scale

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
In games I played this week

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
So here's the next game I played

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
White Knight Chronicles came out in 08

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
It's like a level 5 game for the Playstation 3

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
What was it? Final Fantasy 11

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
The offline version almost

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Well here's the thing

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I'm not sure what the fuck this game is

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Like and that's

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
The weird thing about it

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Like I kind of feel like White Knight Chronicles

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Is one of those games where

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
It has a bit of an identity crisis

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Where they try to do so much with it

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
That they have a lot in the game

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
But it doesn't do any of it exceedingly well

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
And it's not that I dislike the game

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
It's been interesting to me enough

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Where I've sank like 4 hours in it so far

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
But

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I don't know

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Let me kind of set the stage for you

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
It's kind of your typical like

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
You've been kidnapped and you gotta go find her

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Type of thing

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
You create this character in the beginning of the game

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
And your character does nothing in the story

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Your character literally stands there

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Next to the main character

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
While everything is playing out

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Which is really weird right?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
So ok whatever

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
The main character and his little lackey

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
You go off on the adventures

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
And you know you're killing things

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
And the battle system is the closest thing I could compare it to

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Is like Final Fantasy 12

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Because you can kind of do like live attacks

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
And things and the coolest part was that you can create

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Combos based on your class

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And you can kind of like string these

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Combos together that you've created

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
And so it's kind of cool

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Like I like that

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And you go out in the fields and you know

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Fight some monsters just go from one place to the other

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
And all the monsters you see on the map

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
You start to get some frame rate issues

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
In some areas which are on the Playstation 3

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Which is supposed to be this uber piece of technology

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Is a little bit

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
But whatever you know you kind of look past that

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
And go forward

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
And then

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
After about a couple hours into the story it says

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
By the way there's this whole GeoNet thing

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
You can hook up online

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
And play with other people and get quests

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And do this stuff together

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
And so I'm like oh maybe that's why your character

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Has been a lackey this whole time

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Because that's like really going to be your online character

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Even though they had nothing to do with the single player mode

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
This character is going to be like

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Your little online person

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
And I don't know

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
And then the game starts to feel like

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Now I'm playing Phantasy Star Universe

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
There's all these quests

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
That you can kind of do and there's recommended levels

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
And you go out in the field

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
And do your goal like it really kind of felt like

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Phantasy Star Universe

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Where you play the single player for a little while

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
And then all of a sudden it's like oh hey it's a multiplayer game too

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
So it's really weird

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I don't know how else to explain it

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
And sometimes the camera

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Can kind of bug and sometimes

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
You know the battle system

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Starts to feel a little bit like okay

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Like could I gain my little powers

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
A little faster so I could do the cool stuff

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
More often because right now this feels very slow moving

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
So yeah White Knight Chronicles

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
A bit of an identity crisis

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I didn't hate it

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I don't love it

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I like it but I have a really difficult time

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Explaining to anybody

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
What the game is

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
So your rating in a nutshell is just what meh?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I think if you like

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Japanese RPG type of games

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
And you like the more actiony

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Based ones like you like Phantasy Star

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Online

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
It's not press X to swing your sword

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
It's a little more active time battle than that

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
But if you kind of like

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
That sort of idea then I think you'd like it

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
And if you like your grind fest

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I think it would be permissible

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
And especially now that you can find it most places

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Like 30, 35 bucks

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
That's a fair price to pay

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Considering it has a pretty robust online mode

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
It's a fee for

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
So I'll give it that

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
And I guess there's a sequel that came out in Japan

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
But I don't think it's coming out here

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Because unfortunately I do not believe the game did too well

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
So there you go

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Yeah so that was the

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
That was the weird thing

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Then I played

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Fallout 3

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I was partying like it was 2008

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
But I finally got a hold of this game

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
On the used game sale

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And yeah I think the people describing it

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
With guns, really good

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Great story though

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I was totally into it in the beginning

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I think they do a great job kind of setting the stage

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
As you're doing that whole like baby

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
To child to adult

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
And all that

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I don't want to spoil anything even though the game is like years old now

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
But you know it's kind of like

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
How you get to where you are in the story

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
And why you're in a nuclear wasteland

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
And all this stuff

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
And yeah the only unfortunate thing about it

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Is that if you don't save often

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
The NPC you might have wanted to do a quest for

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Will end up dead and now you can't do that quest

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
So uh

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Save now, save often

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
That's really the only terrible thing I can think about it

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Otherwise I gotta say

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Another reason why I really like this game

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Is that it's not just that it's like first person shooter

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
But you can use some of like your little power

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
By hitting the right bumper

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
To go into like this like

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Focus attack mode

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Where if I suck at first person shooters

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
At least if I'm like kind of like stealthy enough

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
At second person points

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I can still shoot someone in the head with a very accurate shot

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Because it basically stops the game

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
And you can focus on a part of the body

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
And it tells you the percentage

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Yeah a little bit

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Because it tells you like the percentage of success

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
So I thought that was kind of neat

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
So uh yeah

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I like Fallout and it's a beautiful game

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
And there's so much to it

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
And if you have the game of the year edition

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
You just have quests upon quests upon quests

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
So uh yeah

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
My Fallout 3

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Um let's see

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Something else I want to talk about

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
I've had 11 days in a row off of work

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Because at my work we take the entire time

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Between Christmas and New Years off

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
It's like a PTO thing I won't get into details

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
That's what we do

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
So I've had 11 days to kind of you know play some games

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
And so forth

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
One day I decided you know what

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I'm gonna watch The Tester season 2

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I'm gonna just download every single episode

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I'm gonna watch the whole damn thing

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Yeah sure me

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Has sure me's bowels been voided

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Okay sure me's asleep so hopefully she won't hear me

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Talking about this

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
I gotta admit something you guys

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
It was actually a pretty good show

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Like it was better than the first season

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
What I watched of it

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
I think the show

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Now here's the show if you haven't heard of it

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
You can only download the show

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
It's only available on PlayStation Network

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
And it's a show about people that are

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Imagine it's The Apprentice

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
The Donald Trump Show you're fired

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
But it's with video games and the ultimate job is to become

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
The PlayStation Tester

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Which is why this show is getting a lot of shit

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Because what a glamorous job game testing is

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Right?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
But what I like about the show

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
What I ended up ultimately liking about it

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Was that you know

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
It didn't really hide the fact

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
That none of these people

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Really had the goal of being a PlayStation Tester

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
A lot of them said

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Fully self aware

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I want this job to get my foot in the door

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
So I can work with these people

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
To work my way up

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
And like this one girl

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
She even says in one episode

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
You know what? I don't even own a PlayStation 3

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I want to make games for children

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
And you might kind of look at that and go

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
What? You don't even own a PlayStation 3? What the hell are you doing on this show?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
But I kind of looked at that going

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
That's really kind of honest of Sony to have in there

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Because if you think everybody that's working

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
In the video game industry right now

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Grew up on video games

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
And I had a pickup call coming

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
And so I thought it was a very kind of like honest response

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
And another guy had said

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
You know what? I want to do this so I can get into PR

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
And yeah

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
So it seemed like everybody that was kind of on the show

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Like actually really wanted to be there

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
And I have to admit

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I can't remember the last time I saw a reality show

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Where by the time it was down to the last episode

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
The final three people

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Like I would have been happy with any single one of them winning

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Ultimately the person that won

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
I thought was a

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Person that was really going to use

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Their potential and so forth

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
But I would have been happy if Sony really

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Ended up hiring any of them

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Because I thought they kind of told a good story

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
So when I say like

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Oh my gosh you should drop everything you're doing and watch this show

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
No

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I mean like really I should have been trying to catch up on

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
True Blood or some other show

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I don't know why I was watching this

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
But if you're surfing around the channels

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
And you're watching reruns of Cops on G4

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Or you're watching some of this other garbage that's on TV

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Like honestly the tester

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
It's not that bad

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
You know it's not like

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
They are

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
It's interesting because

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
You're going to look at some of the like types of challenges

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
They do and so forth and like you're like

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
What does this have to do with game testing

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Does it have anything to do with game testing

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
But it's TV

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Look at The Apprentice

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
What does a lot of the crap they do on that show have to do with

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Actually running a company

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Not a lot but usually there's that one little

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Tip in it

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
That is kind of the focus of the episode

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And that's the same thing I mean this show is a complete rip off

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Of The Apprentice in many ways

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
So yeah I

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Really didn't hate it

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
In fact I kind of liked it

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
And I think I'll watch next season

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Isn't that weird

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Like we're supposed to hate this show right

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I'm not smelling any gas from Shermy

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
And to me the second season

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
What the second season did better than the first season

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Is I really felt like the people

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
That were just like

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Didn't even want to be there or were just cast

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Were like the very first person

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
That was off that show

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I was like if this person laughs in the show

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I'm gonna just swallow my own tongue

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Or something it's just terrible

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
But the very first person they kicked off was the right person

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
It was somebody who didn't even need to be there

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
They did have someone that was on

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
That was kind of more of a drama causer than anything else

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
And not to really like spoil

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
What happens or anything

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
But ultimately like when his

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Desserts comes up you kind of go

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Oh yeah like if you're like ah

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
So I don't know if that was like a TV thing or what

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
But there you go

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
So looking at our chat

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Room chat at chat.orangelaunge

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Radio.com Bochi Kawa in our chat room

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Says oh tester I thought that it was interesting

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
This run that jerk must have been a plant

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
I really don't think anyone would go that far

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
To be an asshole and would get anywhere near

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Thinking he wants a job I think you're

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Right I think he was one of those people that was cast

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
For drama I mean maybe he did want the job

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
But not as bad as

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
The people that ultimately make it to the

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Final episode and that do end up

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Ultimately getting the job so

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Yeah there you go

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Not as terrible as I would have thought I know I was

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Surprised maybe you would be too who knows

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
So that's it that's it for my gaming week

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Let's quickly do some housekeeping

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
You can

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Join us on twitter at twitter.com

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Slash o l r we'll be taking some tweets

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Later on in the show of course and

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
We will be of course

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
And if you don't already have us

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
On facebook please consider adding us

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Facebook.com slash orangeloungeradio

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
And with that we'll get into some

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Gaming news tonight and Loki as always

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Will start us off

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Ah yes and this is kind of interesting

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
You know the Playstation

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
3 hacking news

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
It's kind of been going back and forth as far

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Okay we found a crack and oh hey

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
We patched a crack and

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
So on and so forth but this

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I don't know if they can be able to recover from

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
During the

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Kind of hacker conference

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Going on right now the chaos communications

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Conference 27C3

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Apparently the

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Hackers responsible for the Wii's homebrew channel

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Who I guess is the group called

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Failoverflow gave a presentation

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Which they've said they

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Figured out the private key

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Sony uses to authorize code

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
To run on retail PS3 systems

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
What that means is that

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Hackers would have almost full control

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Of the PS3 system without

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
The use of a USB device

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Basically

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
It means they'd be able to sign their own code

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
And you'd be able to

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Do a lot

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Of things on there including you know

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Their whole big thing is to run

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Linux on PS3's whatever the

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Firmware version is

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Of course they're not really interested in

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Piracy with this obviously people

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Could adapt it to do that

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
But they're really kind of concerned

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
With just the applications of it and

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Um

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Some of the things that was kind of neat

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
About it is that they

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Literally have almost access to all

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
The like cores and everything using this

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Um

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
It's just kind of neat

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Who saw this punchline coming a mile away

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
When the PlayStation 3 first did away with Linux

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
And see this is actually hard coded into

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Each console

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
There's no way to patch this

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
They can't

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Wow

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I mean basically what they can do is

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
They create keys or whatever

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
These USB devices have keys on them

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Assigned to them and what they've done

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Like to prevent those

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Jailbreak devices from working

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Is they add blacklists for different keys

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Well

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
The master key you can create your own keys

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
From it so

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
They block one you can just create another one

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
You know it's just impossible to

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Stop it

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
So what happens now? Piracy runs rampant

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Or what? Not necessarily I mean

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Their whole big thing is they don't want to

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
They're not aiming towards piracy they just want to

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Bring like homebrew

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
To the PS3

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Linux is really what they're looking to

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Do

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Let's bring Linux back I guess

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
But don't you think this would have also been a conclusion

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Anyway even if Sony hadn't done away with Linux

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Do you think that maybe they were working on this

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Anyway

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I mean I guess

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
What do we know we're not in this little organization

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Or whatever but

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
It's just interesting to me it's really interesting that

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Sony kind of pulls the plug on the whole

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Linux thing because they were worried about

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
People exploiting it for piracy really

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
At the end of the day and now it's like

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Well we're just going to shove Linux

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
In this thing whether you like it or not

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
And if they can install Linux on a freaking toaster

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
They can install Linux on a

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Hacker proof PS3

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
This is probably worse than the whole

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Exploit through

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Linux to begin with

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Because a lot of people may not have had Linux

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
On their system or weren't even interested

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
In that but the fact that they

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Took it away and people don't like

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
When things are taken away especially when they

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Paid for them whether it's an advertised

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Feature or not I don't care

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Now to be fair

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Just devil's advocate you don't have

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
To patch your PS3 to remove

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
The Linux you just won't be able to play

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Any games in the past

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
That's removed from your system

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
That's basically it we can either

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Say oh well you know

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
You could lose Linux and you get column A

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Games made in 2010

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Or you get column B Linux

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
You can't have both

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
So that's kind of lame

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
But it's going to be interesting

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
To see where this goes from here because

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
That's bad

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
SSJ100Matt in our chat room says

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I don't know I still think people are going to

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Use it to pirate games well of course they are

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Of course there are people out there

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
That are going to do that and

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I don't doubt that they're

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Going to find ways to do that but

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
It's just that the

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Aim of this group wasn't to

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Just you know

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Create some sort of way to pirate games

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
They're not interested in that

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
But other people are

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Interested in that I'm really curious

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
To see what Sony's kind of

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Response ends up being to this because you know

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
A lot of them are probably coming back from holiday

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Tomorrow you know while I'm sure there's some

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
People working for Sony 365

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Days a year there's probably a lot of people

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Coming back tomorrow and it's going to be interesting to see what

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Their kind of response is if they do try to

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Patch it I know you say it's unpatchable

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
They try to do something I mean

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
They've got it they kind of owe it to their

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Basically I mean they've got a lot

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Of things even just after

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
This conference you know they have things being released

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
That group has already released

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
The development tools for

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
The stuff that they have so now they have

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Different you know

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Like

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Early code and stuff to

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Code to pack and unpack

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Pup and package files to

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Make and read

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Selfs and

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Other developer related stuff

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
So you know

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Look forward to possibly

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Custom firmwares what not

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
And they've already released the root key so

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I mean

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I don't know there's not much

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
More you can really do there it's just

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Yeah

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
It's going to be tough there's

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Not really any way that they're going to be able to get around this

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Wow

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Because if you think about it you can't change

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
The master key if you do

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
That then like

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
You know some of the consoles aren't going to

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Work you just can't it's part of

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
The hardware

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Alright well something else to look forward to

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Hardware wise

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Hardware wise in 2011

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Is the psp2

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Of course we've heard rumors and rumors about

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
It but more and more

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Seems to come out every week and this has to do with a

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
New York Times interview that

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Khaz Harai he's the of course Sony computer

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Entertainment head talking

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
A little bit about the psp2 but not

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Directly a lot of people are kind of inferring

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Things about the psp2 because

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Keep in mind Sony has not confirmed a psp2

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
It's just one of those duh

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Of course they're working on a new hand held system

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
And we don't know if it's a phone

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
We don't know if it's a psp2

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
We don't know if it's both or one of each

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
We don't know that stuff yet but we do know

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
What Khaz Harai said to the New York Times and that was

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Quote depending on the game there are ones

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Which you can play perfectly well with a

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Touch panel but you can definitely play

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Immersive games better without physical buttons

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
And pads I think there could be games

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Where you're able to use both in combination

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Oh so suddenly he's kind of

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Endorsing a little bit about touch things right

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Hmm this must mean

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
That some of those rumors about the touch panels are true

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Quote we don't want gamers to be asking

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
What's the difference between

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
A Playstation phone or a phone

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
And a psp we have to come up

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
With a message that users will understand

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
It would have to be a product that keeps

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
The Playstation's strengths intact

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Again sort of

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
You know kind of

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Not outright saying there's a Playstation

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Phone but saying you know we're trying

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
To kind of you know

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
You have to do it right and of course

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
We're doing it right

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Come on

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Please

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Well Consumer Electronics Show is this weekend if I'm not mistaken

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Or this week

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
So you might see it there but

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I mean if it's

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I would say this if the phone

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
And the psp2 are

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Separate I would say you'll see the phone

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
As CES you might see it as soon as CES

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Possibly Game Developers Conference

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Psp2 however

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
E3 I mean

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Maybe Game Developers Conference but again

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Game Developers Conference is not supposed to be the media event

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
That's E3

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
But Sony kind of seems

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
To use Game Developers Conference

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Anyway to make big announcements

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
They talked about the move

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
They unveiled Playstation Home

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
It wouldn't be unheard of for them to drop

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
A little bombshell

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Although I think the psp2 would just be so big of a bombshell

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I think Game Developers

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Conference is too early for it

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Unless they just want to come out and say

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Okay fine you figured it out

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
So here developers get to work

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
We'll see

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Anyhow moving on with some other news

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Sadness

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Very very much sadness

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
About the psp2 I know

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Arcade Infinity

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Uh oh

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
It's gone

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
The inevitable has happened

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
It's closing on January 15th so we need to go

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Take a trip to LA like now

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Like tomorrow? Yeah

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Good luck right

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Basically Arcade Infinity

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Was the big place that

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Got a lot of RB money in the US

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Not just that

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
But a lot of just import games in general

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
I played an Umjamilami

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Arcade machine at Arcade Infinity

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
And the tambourine version of

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Samba de Amigo

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Which by the way is the gayest video game I've ever played in my life

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Was that tambourine

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
To whatever

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
You shake around a tambourine like you're Stevie Nicks

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
It's crazy

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Except without the big hobo

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Stuff

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Anyway I'm sorry I meant boho stuff

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
But yeah these are the places

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
That brought us Blaze Blue

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
And DJ Max Technica

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
And the Gundam game

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Remember that awesome Gundam game?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
And remember one day

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
That we were there

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
We sat and played like what 10 games of

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Shock Troopers

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Just because it was on free play

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
That was pretty fun

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
I've never played Typing of the Dead

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
And we're like

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Oh my god it's in Japanese

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
We could get as far as the boss

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
That would ask you questions and you'd have to answer them

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
And then it would be like shit I don't know Japanese

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I can't do it

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
But I mean man

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I just have so many good memories

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Of that place but now

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
It's gonna be

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Closing

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
It's going away

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
I gotta be honest the last time I was there

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
I didn't have quite the wonder

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
That it had when I was there back in its

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Hay day but I think that's

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Sadly arcades in general

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
I really hate to say it but

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Man the online stuff is really

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
It's really

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Taking its toll I mean it's kind of obvious

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Well you know the other thing that they were doing

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
There was

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Selling import skylines

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Like bringing

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
In cars from Japan

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
And trying to make them street legal

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
For sale in the U.S.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
But yeah apparently Bimani

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Style folks are having a

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Gathering there for the last day

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
So

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Our buddy DJ Tyrant

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Who once in a while does some stories

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Foragelongstreet.com he's gonna go and give us

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
A little report so since I can't be there

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
It'll be nice to have somebody there

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Bring me back a token

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I probably have a bunch still somewhere

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I know I've got some somewhere but

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
That's just really sad cause I mean

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Whenever we would go to LA we would always make it a point

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
That we were gonna go to Arcade Infinity

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
And then we'd go have dinner at that place

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
That you had to walk all the way freaking across

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
A you know football field sized parking lot

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
To go eat at

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
And then we'd go back and play more games and then

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
You know it's just it's sad

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Yeah Very very sad

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Well it's just sad in general that

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Here's another great arcade closing its doors

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
And this is a trend we saw starting

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Years ago with what Southern Hills Golf

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Land Folsom Game Room

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
You know all these

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Arcades just started closing and closing

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
And even the arcades that are still there

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Which would be like Roseville Golf Land and some of the other

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Golf lands that are out there

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Are nothing but ticket redemption machines now

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
You know what I mean?

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Shermie's trying to get out so she can go poop on the tester

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Yep I figured as much

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
She's probably trying to get out No she's fine

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
She's sitting underneath your butt She doesn't poop in the corner

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
She's sitting underneath you

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Shermie is equally sad

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
About the closure of Arcade Infinity

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
It is sad

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Certainly back in the heyday that was the only place

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I could play Keyboard Mania

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Yeah

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
And I just remember playing the crap

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Out of that Gundam game

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Well somebody needs to take a 40

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
And pour it out in the parking lot

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
What are they doing to the rest of their candy cabs?

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Unfortunately I only have good beer

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
So I'm not going to do that

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Just go to BevMo and get one crappy beer

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
So you can

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Ice cold, cold 45

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Cold 45, dump it in the lot

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Thank you

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Please and take pictures of it

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Take pictures of it

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
One for me and one for my homies

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Rest in peace Arcade Infinity

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Sorry to see you go

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
I wonder what they're doing with their cabinets

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
You opportunist

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Probably the same thing that Tilt at the Metron is doing

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
You want to get a BeatMania machine for 300 bucks

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I should check uh

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Well I don't have a

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Speaking of other arcades that have

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Gone away

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
You get a Marvel vs Capcom for 300 bucks

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Allen saw that and he said Christmas Rob! Christmas!

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Christmas!

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Poor Allen, poor

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Alright anyway

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Uh yeah

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Well Nintendo was warning that you shouldn't have children

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Under the age of 6

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Playing the 3DS in 3D mode

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Apparently it will make them go cross-eyed

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Well that's not the reason

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
But it may hurt their vision

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
So

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
It's bad

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
So don't play it in 3D mode

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Unless you want cross-eyed kids

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Oh come on

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Surely it can't be

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
That you play

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
This for 5 minutes and you're gonna go cross-eyed

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
You're talking about prolonged

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Exposure

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Is what this is

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Nintendo's probably over-reacting

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
So there isn't a lawsuit

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
When at the end of the day this really comes down to

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Parents, you really should watch how much

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Of the games your 6 year old is playing

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Exactly and that brings up a wonderful point

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Is that you can use the included

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Parental controls

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
That allow parents to lock the device

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
In 2D mode

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
So it's the 3DS 2DS

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
That's okay though

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
As much as I think the 3D thing is kinda cool

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Like there's gonna be times where I don't want

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
The 3D, like I just wanna play

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
A 2D little game and have it at that

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
But what's interesting to me

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Is that they are releasing movies

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
On the 3DS

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
At least if E3 is any indication

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
I guess we won't really know till the official

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Press reveal or what have you

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
But they were showing a

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Trailer for Tangled

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
The Rapunzel movie that's out in theaters

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
By the way it was actually really good

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
They were showing a trailer

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
For that at E3 on the 3DS

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
So they're gonna market

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
3D movies for kids on these things

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
So

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
You know

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Granted you could say that well Tangled

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Would also work for a 10-15

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
To an adult really year old

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Come on

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
To an adult year old?

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
You know what parent isn't gonna want to sit

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Their 6 year old in the back of the car and have them watch

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Tangled to shut them up on a road trip

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
In 3D!

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
It'd be like buying an

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Expensive 3D

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
HD television and going

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
You know what? I'm watching all

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
3D

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I don't need this 3D

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I'll pay your high premium price

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
For your TV with fancy technology

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
But I'm not, in fact you know what

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
I'm not even hooking up HDMI to it

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I'm going straight composite bitch

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
So Nintendo

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Is paranoid that

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Some kid somewhere is gonna

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Go cross eyed because they spent

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
12 hours a day looking at the

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
3DS and so they're putting this disclaimer

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
On it to kind of save their own butt because

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Parents can't be bothered to watch how much

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Their kids are playing games. That's what the story

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Should really say, right?

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
At least that's what I think

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Enablers!

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
I love this chat room

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Chatter here, big wang eater

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Um

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
So that'd be cool if 3DS had a deer hunter

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
In 3D, well you know what?

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Cabela's comes out each year

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
They've been doing a lot of games on the DS

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
I would not be surprised if you see a 3DS

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Cabela's game

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Somewhere somehow some idiot parent

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Will let their kid play that, their six year old

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Kid play that in 3D. Big wang eater

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Thank you big wang eater

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Alright, 3D porn

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Well the big wang eater goes on to say

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
3D porn, well you know

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
You will be able to take your own 3D pictures with this

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
You can show the big wang being eaten

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Can you share the pictures you take

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Like on the internet or whatever? I think you can

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Awesome, time to penis

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
5 seconds, 5 seconds

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Before we have a 3D penis

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
You know what?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
See, some of us actually

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Have people that we can

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Do this in real life with

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And don't need to watch it in 3D

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
We have what's called real life

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Ah

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
They've also already been marketing like

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
When I did see that whole Tangled movie

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Which by the way, I saw lots of

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Six year olds in that theater wearing 3D glasses

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And watching the movie, but anyway

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
They were showing a commercial

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
For a 3D camera

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
So you'd like watch the pictures on your 3D TV

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
That you take with the new camera

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
So, and this isn't DS related

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
It's like a new Sony camera or whatever

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
That does 3D pictures

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Cause everybody has a boner for 3D right now

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I like what Isam said

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
4D porn sex across time

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I approve of that

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Alright

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
That's what you need a TARDIS for

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Well, moving on to other things

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Nintendo that aren't necessarily 3D

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
But I bet a lot of people wish this was

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Hey remember, there's a new Zelda game coming you guys

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Remember?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
They were talking about it

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
They were talking about it at E3 and it was delayed from Christmas

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Rob ignored it

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
As if he has the upward thrust

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Only in 2D

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I'm sorry

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
But here's the deal guys, not only has it been delayed past Christmas

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
But now Nintendo is kinda saying

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Yeah that whole early

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
2011 thing

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Liars

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
That's not really gonna happen

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Because of course there is very dense gameplay

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
And you're gonna want to replay this game

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Dense?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
That's not a description for gameplay

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
They have quietly

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Moved this game to a

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
2011 release

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Could be any time next year

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
We need to save it for

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
The holidays

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
For our Wii HD

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
It's gonna be a game that's slightly uprest

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Well there you go

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
There's not a lot of

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Like huge games I can think of that really have me

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Excited that are coming out on the Wii anytime soon

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Like it's all about the 3DS at Nintendo right now

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
So unfortunately this news is a little bit sad

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Well

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Hey they have innovative games for the Wii

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Like Mario's Sports Mix

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
It's a sports game compilation

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
There's none of those on the Wii right?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
That sound you heard in the background

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
That was crickets chirping

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
We have a soundboard for that

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
That was me blinking

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Tired call on our chatroom talking about 3D by the way

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
It says 3D TVs are way behind in the 3D technology

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Theaters now are using polarized lenses

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Which doesn't need to use the shutter glasses technology

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
In other words you don't have to recharge the glasses to watch 3D

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Exactly and that's what I'm saying they need to fucking do with those damn TVs

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Cause those glasses are like $5 or free if you steal them from the movie theaters

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
You're not stealing them

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
You're paying the premium for them anyway

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
You're paying the recycler

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
They can go fuck themselves I'm paying for those damn glasses

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Actually

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But they're still gonna charge you the full theater price when you bring in

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Whether or not you bring in your own pair of 3D glasses it seems like

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Actually I thought it was a great suggestion

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
One of my friends suggested after seeing Tron

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
You know we should keep these glasses

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And we should like bling them out

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And like you know bedazzle them

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And you'll put like pipe cleaner designs on them

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
And all this

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
So that way you know next time they try to hand you your 3D glasses

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Oh no thanks I brought my own

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
They have designer polarized glasses you can get like pay like hundreds of dollars for

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Awesome

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Why?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
You know what I should actually hold onto those to wear over my glasses

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
For when I go outside in the sun

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Nice

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Do those things work

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
The 3D glasses for the theater

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
They don't work with the TVs do they?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
No

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
That was what we were saying

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
The only 3D technology that I think that's worthwhile is the Disney one

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Just because it uses the polarized glasses

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Or Nintendo's new technology which uses nothing at all

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Exactly

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
They're actually looking to do TVs that way too

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Which I think would really hurt your eyes

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
But I think that the polarized glasses are a good alternative

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Because in that way instead of saying

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Yeah you gotta buy this 3D TV

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Oh by the way if you want more than two people to watch that

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
You're gonna need to buy another set of $100 glasses

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Yeah

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
No thank you

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Alright well

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
So Zelda Skyward Sword

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
2D, 3D, whatever D it's in

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
It's probably not coming out until December

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
What?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Upward thrust

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Moving on

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Well you know Final Fantasy 13 came out for the Xbox 360 in Japan

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
And guess what?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
That's how well it did

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000
It showed up at 39th in the software charts for Japan

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Which is really low

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So yeah they only sold

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Well I'll put it this way the game that made number 20 sold 22,579 units

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Yeah

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
That's kind of

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So it probably sold about 10,000 or whatever

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Something like that

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Wasn't that how many 360 owners there are in Japan?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Well the number of

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
It's under 1.5 million

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Users in Japan

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And keep in mind the PS3

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Is close to 6 million

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Basically

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
There were a lot of

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Also because of how early Final Fantasy 13 came out in Japan

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
And they thought it was only gonna be for

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
PlayStation 3 so a lot of people bought

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
A PlayStation 3 just to play Final Fantasy 13

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I was gonna say when I first kind of heard about this story earlier in the week

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I had gotten into Double Take and said

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I thought they specifically said they are not doing 360 Final Fantasy 13 in Japan

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
So where the hell did this come from?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Well even with this one it had you know

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
A few extra goodies and you know

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
They brought other stuff out and did a price reduction on it

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
And it still wasn't enough

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
So kind of like the typical international editions they usually do in Final Fantasy games right?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
But see now though

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Well the whole thing is that typically these international editions have come out on the same console

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And have had the English content

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Like for example I've got

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Final Fantasy X-2 International

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And the game I can pick

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Japanese or English language

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I can choose my subtitles

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
And yeah I'm trying to

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Watch this comparison to

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
To see you know

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
What the deal is and

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
The Xbox 360

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
One actually kind of looks like

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Poop in comparison

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Oh no it doesn't they look the same

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I think people look way too

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I think in order to see that level of detail

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
You have to be sitting as close to your TV

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
As you're sitting next to your monitor right now

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Well yeah but I'm saying

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
You know but also for people who have

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
You know a really good HDTV

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
It's

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Gonna make a difference like right now

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
The biggest things now keep in mind I also

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Have an eye for it

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I'm seeing difference in color quality

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I'm seeing difference in line quality

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You know

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Yeah but how much of that can be blamed on the fact you're watching a streaming

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
And that's why Final Fantasy 13 sucked

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
No Final Fantasy 13 is great

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
It is I think it's a great

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Game and it's

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I don't understand all this hatred

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Well I do understand why people are hating on it

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
But trust me I've played way worse games this past year

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Final Fantasy 13 isn't even close

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Well no I'm not saying it's at all bad

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
That would be Final Fantasy 14

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Yeah seriously no I know you're not

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I did the same thing with the Saturn and the Playstation

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Versions of Castlevania Symphony of the Night

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Because we had the Saturn

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
One and the uh

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And we listened to the two

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
We watched both of them

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
The Saturn version had better 2D

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Shitty 3D

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
The Saturn version had better sound quality

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
The Playstation version had better

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Load times

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
So I'm the kind that does

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
This type of comparison so

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Going back to the story at hand because I kind of feel like

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
The 360 PS3 debate on Final Fantasy 13

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Was like 9 months old when the game came out

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
But going back to the story at hand

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I get the sense people in Japan

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Didn't buy this game because A

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
They didn't know for the longest time that it was coming out

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And most people bought it on Playstation 3

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Thinking it was never coming out on the 360

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And B, you don't have

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Close to that same

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Adoption ratio you have here in the US

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
In Japan you're talking six

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Playstation 3's for every one Xbox 360

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
That's not even

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Close to the ratio here

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Which is not the reverse but it's

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
A lot closer to one to one than that

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And also though I have to look at it

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
This way too is that we're dealing with

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Sony, a Japan based company

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And we're dealing with Microsoft

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
A US based company

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I think they're gonna know their markets a little bit

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Better in their native area

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
That's really my point

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
You know

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
For example, the Saturn did

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So much better in Japan than it did here

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And a lot of it had to do with marketing

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
A lot of it had to do with audience

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
You know I think that

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Going with the same thing I think that

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Microsoft knew how to market to an American audience

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
They didn't know how to market to a Japanese audience

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And maybe they didn't want the same type of

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Features that we do here so you start off

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
With a less interested

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Base and then you bring out a game

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
However long after

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
There's been another version

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Out that's available to people who

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Have the system

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
So it's

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
It's basically

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I don't know why they expected it to do well

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I was gonna say I was hoping Final Fantasy 13

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Doesn't suck I just bought it but I haven't started it yet

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
It doesn't suck by the way

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
For the Xbox 360

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It doesn't suck it's just better on PS3

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I'll take your word for it then

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And I don't even think it's

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Negligible honestly

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I don't think you would notice a difference

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I was gonna say what's the difference honestly

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
You have to disc swap on the 360 version

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
You know what

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
We had to do that on the PlayStation 2

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
What kind of TV do you have an HD TV

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
That you play on or do you use the standard?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I have a Samsung

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Is it full 1080

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Or is it only 720

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
You might notice

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Like the hair is a little different

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
It's an LED

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Basically the big things you're gonna notice

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Is difference in color

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
You won't notice any difference if you never see the

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
PS3 version I'll put it that way

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But the big difference is that you're dealing with

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
More jaggedies

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
More aliasing on the

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Xbox 360 version because the graphics processor

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Is different the game was made for the PS3

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
So you're basically dealing with

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
The whole

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Port issues

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
You're also dealing with the fact that there is

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Rampant hardcore pornography in the Xbox

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
360 version

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
While there wasn't in the PS3 version

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And that may offend some people but for me

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
That was a plus

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I mean

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
It was much

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I'd expect that kind of stuff in Mexico but

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I'm not sure whether that makes me want to play it more or not

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I don't need to know that about you

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Anyhow

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Why don't we travel the world and talk about some release dates

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Some other games that might do a little bit better

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Or

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Not

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
This week is still a little bit light

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
January I mean come on

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
It's not a big ol' release month

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Some cool stuff though coming out

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
But not so much this week

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Lost in Shadow though on the Wii is making

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
It's way out so that puzzle game

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
From Hudson Soft it kind of has a little bit of a

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Shadow Colossus vibe to it

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
That'll be on the Wii

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Osborne house

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
That's on Nintendo DS

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Cool you get to go to the Osborne's house?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Uh

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Yeah

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Not that Osborne house I'm afraid

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Uh Emergency

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
2012

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Um

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I'm assuming that you play some sort of

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Emergency crew when the world

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Is ending and yes it looks about right

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Actually so that's kind of cool

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
It says warning the world as we know it is out of

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Control as the head of

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
All rescue operations you

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Must ensure that you get the job

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Done with fire and rescue services

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Yeah I don't think fire and rescue services

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Are going to stop a tidal wave from

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Wiping out a city

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I don't think that really works

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
But they'll try

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
They will try

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Hold back that wave with your axe there

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Um and then apparently Ghost Trick

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Phantom Detective is supposed to be out

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
As well on Nintendo DS

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And that is it

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Traveling over to Japan this week

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Uh not this week

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
But next week is when you start to see some stuff

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
On the 360 like Arcana Heart 3

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
But I guess I'll reiterate that next week

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
On the 360 going over to the Playstation 3

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Kind of the same story

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
There's not really a lot out there either

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I'm getting the sense it's going to be a very

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Slow week

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Nintendo Wii you don't even see anything until the end of the month

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
That's the crazy stuff

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
But the DS

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
The DS probably has your one highlight and big game this week

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Saga 3

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Jiko no Hasa

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Shadow or Light comes out this week

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
That of course is in the Saga series

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Right by Squeenix

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
On the DS and that's probably the big one

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
That people are going to be looking at and importing

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
When I look at the screenshots of this game

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I really kind of go oh it's like a Saga game

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
That kind of looks like those Final Fantasy remakes they did on the DS

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
That's pretty much what you got there

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
So if you like the Saga series you'll probably be into that

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And that is really it

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
That's like seriously the only thing

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
You have to look forward to this week

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Um the PSP does have a slot machine

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Game coming out but do you really care?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
I don't think you do

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
So

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
A slot machine game you said?

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Yes

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
You know that would actually do really well over here to get into

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
With the elderly market

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Can I talk about Europe now?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I guess you can

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Well um on the first there was

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
UFC trainer like no one really

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Gives a crap about that

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
And on the fourth Lost in Shadow and guess what

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
That's it

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Very slow week but you know the holiday

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Shopping fever is gone so

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Geez people

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
In two weeks we got two great games on the PS3

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Isn't that ironic

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Alright

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Well we got a couple more stories for you guys

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And then the classic game of the week

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
We'll close out part A in just a moment

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Yes one of the bitches that we had last year

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
With Ubisoft with their

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Really odd

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Use of

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
DRM

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
They had a

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Basically you had to be connected

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
To their servers the entire time

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
While you're playing different games

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
And if for whatever reason you

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Feature or had some sort of

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Connection problem whether it be just

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
A quick you know disconnect

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Your game would actually stop

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
And you would have no opportunity to save or whatever

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
It would just totally fuck you up

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
And that was on even like single player games

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Like Assassin's Creed 2

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Or Splinter Cell Conviction

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Well apparently though

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
There has been an update I guess

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
That

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Those DRM checks are a little bit

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Easier now

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
In fact on games

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I guess like Assassin's Creed 2

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And Splinter Cell Conviction for example

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
They have now

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Made it where it just has to check

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
With the servers when you boot the game

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
But if you lose your internet connection

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
While playing the game it will not

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Actually interfere with your game at all

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
So that's kind of cool

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
But also makes me think that it doesn't matter

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Because people got around the stupid hacks

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
People don't want to deal with it

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
They won't that's the reality

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
They got around it anyways and all it

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Really hurt was the people that bought

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
The game legitimately so

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I don't know

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
But at least it's not

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
As terrible

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Alright

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Well kind of

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
One of the big stories from the end of last year was

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
The fact that Harmonix was being unloaded

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
By Viacom and it looks like we might have

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Some resolution finally to this

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
A press release that came out over the holiday

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
From John Drake saying

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
That who is that Harmonix obviously

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
We are happy to confirm that the news today

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
That the sale of the company is complete

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Viacom and MTV networks have been an

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Amazing home for the past four years

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Blah blah blah fluff fluff right

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
It's where we launched Rock Band and Dance Central

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Beatles, Green Day, blah blah blah

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
We're excited to be returning to our roots as an

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Independent and privately owned studio

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And what this means the

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
DLC schedule marches on for

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Rock Band, we will continue our support of

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Previously released titles, and we're hard at

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Work at some unannounced projects that we think

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
You're going to be pumped about

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
And the other half of this, it wasn't in the press release

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
But it was confirmed they are keeping the licenses

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
For Dance Central and Rock Band, they will get to

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
If they decide to make Rock Band 4

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Or Dance Central 2

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I think at least one of those is a sure thing

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I would honestly say

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I don't think Rock Band 4 is a sure thing at this point

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I think Harmonix might do

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Something new

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
The whole plastic instrument thing

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
But they may not call it Rock Band

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And I think that's okay

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I think sometimes your series needs a swift kick in the pants

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
So I would be

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Quite okay with that if they decide

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I'd be okay with Dance Central 2

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I would be totally okay with Dance Central 2

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
And I think that's a sure thing

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Of course there's going to be a Dance Central 2

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Absolutely, it was clearly the biggest game on Connect

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I'm so happy, we took down the tree today

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
The Christmas tree, so that we were able to move the

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Coffee table out from the middle of the room again

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And connect space again

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Congratulations, there you go

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So there it is, Harmonix going independent

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
That's a very

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Kind of an obvious resolution

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
That none of us had guessed previously

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
So good luck

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
You kind of think

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
When people are talking about selling a company

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
It's like

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
You never really think, hey they could just buy themselves

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Because they probably have a lot of money

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Right?

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Well, good luck to Harmonix

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Pay off for them, we'll see

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Anyway, let's take a minute not to talk about the future

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Or this year, the coming year

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
But to reflect on the past

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And gaming's history and how we all got here

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
To 2011 and gaming

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
In this segment, DarkSakura

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Is going to go through the archives

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
In her cavernous vault

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
That she has here in the house

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And find a game that she says, hey

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
It's not that big

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Listen kids, you should be playing this game

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Respect your elderly games

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And what game did you pick this week?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Hard Drivin'

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
As in the nap machine

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I will go into why it's the nap machine later

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
So forget all this

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Need for speed stuff

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Listen to those really great sound effects

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Bong bong

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Listen for a minute

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
That's about as much music as the game has

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
As a drum roll

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Serious

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Well then listen to some squeaking breaks

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Listen to DarkSakura, tell us about this game

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Hard Drivin' was basically

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
It was touted

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
According to this poster

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
As the world's first authentic driving simulation

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Game

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
It was the first 3D polygon

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Driving environment

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
It used a simulated cabinet

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Virtual reality, oh my god, lawnmower man

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
It's real

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
And it was all on custom hardware

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
It had force feedback

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
A car physics simulator

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And most of the

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Design was done by

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Some dude named Max Behensky

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
So that's pretty cool

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Now also keep in mind that

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Other games that came out around this time like

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Pole Position and Outrun were sprite based

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Scaling

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Ah, you found the best part

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
The instant replay, trying to go up that loop

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Basically, instead of

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Having the sort of artificial graphics

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Where the car wouldn't land

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
The right, you know, right side up

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Or, you know

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
It actually used very realistic

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Physics in the game

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
When you went too far off track

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
You would crash your skin

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Your windshield would crack

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
You could keep driving

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And then it also gave you the replay

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Where you would die

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
And a hideous car fire

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
But you gotta admit, some of it's a little janky

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Like the car explodes and then suddenly

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
In the next frame it's back together

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
It's very jank

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
We are very spoiled by today's graphics

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Keep in mind, this was 1988

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
And this was a polygon game

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
In 1988

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Wow, car explosions

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Do not work that way

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
The car that you're supposed to be in

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Is sort of like a Ferrari Testarossa

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
So I mean, that's pretty cool

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
You basically

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Race

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Against

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
This car called the Phantom Photon

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And you can race the wrong way

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
You can do all this other stuff

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
It's actually, you know

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
It has, um, also

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
You can play it in automatic

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
You also have a realistic manual

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Transmission with a clutch and everything

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
You can stall the car

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
When you miss shift

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
And, you know, like I said, force feedback and everything

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
So it's meant to be a driving simulator

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
And, you know

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
This game was

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Pretty crazy for its time

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
It was put out by Atari

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
And

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
You know, they

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
This was really one of the coolest ones

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
For the record, the

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Genesis version of this game is shit

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Utter, utter shit

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Oh, the Super Nintendo one was shit too

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Yeah, um, so

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
As far as sequels that came out

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
There was Race Driving

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
In 1990, Hard Drivin' 2

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Drive Harder that came out, um

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
On the

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Yeah, on the Atari ST

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And Commodore Amiga

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
An unreleased one called Hard Drivin'

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Airborne in 1993

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
And then Street Drivin' that came out in 2001

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
On the GameCube, Playstation 2 and

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Xbox, um, different versions

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Came out, there

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Hard Drivin' 3, now it's hard

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Hard Drivin' 4 in my pants

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Now, um

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
This that I'm gonna quote on here is that

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
The engine, transmission, control, suspension and

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Physics were modeled in conjunction with

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Doug Milliken who was listed

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
As a test driver in the game credits

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
So, um, that's actually

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Pretty cool, um, this says that his father

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
William Milliken of Milliken

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Research led a team at Cornell

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Aeronautical Laboratory

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
In Buffalo, New York that converted

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Aircraft equations of motion

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
To equations of motion for the automobile

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
So it was a

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
You know, they actually used real science

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
In it, which I thought was pretty cool, it was meant to be a real

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Stimulator

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Um, as far as Easter Eggs

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
In the game, one of the buildings along

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
The speed course, um

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Has a sign that says, uh, sorry

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
A sign above the door that says, The Hut

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Um, if

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
If you made a hard left turn at the start

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Of the game, you have a secret track

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Which is a long straight road that leads to

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
A very short circular track

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Around a tower

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
If you slow down and stop in front of one of the buildings

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
A keyhole appears in the building door

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
What?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Running into a cow will cause a moo sound to be played

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
At least in the Sega Genesis port

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
There's exactly one cow

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Um, and

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Ate carefully

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
After getting a sufficiently high score

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Then, um, you get a full course race against the

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Phantom Photon on the stunt track

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
So it's pretty cool

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Um, but, now I have to tell you

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
About, now I'm gonna

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Put a picture of the cabinet in the chatroom

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Um, for a reason

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
For a specific reason

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
This thing had

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
A chair that would swivel out

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
And

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Inside it was very dark

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
So one day when I was working at

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Cyber station at Bel Air Mall

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
In Mobile, Alabama

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
There was nobody

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
In the damn mall

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
It was Tuesday morning

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I had been up all night, so guess what I did?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I sat my happy butt

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Inside the chair at hard driving

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I filled myself in, and I took a three hour nap

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Well, you know, not like a

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
A full on nap

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
I could still hear people

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
No one came in

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I got all my other stuff done

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
And I sat in the hard driving machine

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
And took a three hour nap

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
It was dark, the chair was comfortable

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
How colossally irresponsible of you, but funny

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Oh please

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I was 19

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
So

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
But at any rate

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
That's my story about the hard driving cabinet

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
It's the great nap machine

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
The game actually, I'll be honest

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I don't like playing hard driving

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
It's hard

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And time has not treated it well

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
No it hasn't

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
But it's notable for what it is

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
I gotta click on this link

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Cause there's a YouTube suggestion here

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
The worst Genesis game ever made

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Hard driving

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
I just wanna remind myself how fucking terrible this is

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Okay, I don't wanna hear some asshole

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Talking about it, I just wanna see it here

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Oh yeah, with the

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And I say that with love

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Crazy ass draw in on the thing

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Oh my god, the framery on here is so awful

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
It's hideous, it's hideous

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
But I mean

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
God, can you imagine that people

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Somebody somewhere actually dropped like $50 on this game

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
I know

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
It's one freaking track, right?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
You missed the cow, Rob, you missed the cow

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Well I'm gonna burn in hell for all eternity

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
For missing the damn cow

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I like Test Drive 3

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
And it came out around the same time

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Looked very similar to this

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
And they, um

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
They came out after this

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
You also have to race other cars

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And I used to try to take a shortcut by driving off-road

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Not something a performance

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
High speed vehicle is meant to do

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
But I did encounter lots of deer

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Deer

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Rob's looking at the Commodore 64

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Yes, Commodore 64 hard driving

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I have to see this

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Wow

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
It's like $10

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And this framery is awful

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Oh wow

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
You could grow old playing this game

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Imagine

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I know this is terrible radio

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Imagine you're playing, I'll link it in the chat

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
But for those listening on the podcast

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Imagine you're playing hard driving on the Game Boy

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
The old Game Boy

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Like the old Game Boy

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Monochrome

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
There's the link in chat

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Somebody spent $50 on this game

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Just so you know

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Is there a loop even?

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Oh no, here's the bridge

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Crash

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Actually, you might get better

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
You might get a faster framerate on the Game Boy

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
And then that was, wow

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Rama in our chat room says

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I worked in a video store when this game came out

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
It did pretty well in sales

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Because it's virtual reality, man

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
It's crazy, wave of the future

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Or something

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
At any rate

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Like I said

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I'm not a fan of the game itself

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
However, I will

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
You're a big fan of naps

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I love naps

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
But I will give it props

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
For what it is and what it did at the time

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
If not for hard driving

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
We may not have Ridge Racer

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
That's true

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
This is

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
The beginning of our 3D racing games

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Right here

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Even though this game really

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Hasn't been treated well with time

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And it's kind of shit now

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Without it, we wouldn't have some of the stuff we have today

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Because people

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Like to do loopy loops and jumpy jumps

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
I just figured I took so many damn naps in the machine

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I may as well play it a couple of times

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I'll tell you something else that's funny

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I want to tell it to other people

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Who have worked in an arcade

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
We got an allotment of 25 tokens a week

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Tell me

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Once you started working at the arcade

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Stop using your damn tokens

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Did you not play anything for a while?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Because you were tired of being there

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
When I quit Rob, seriously

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I had 600 and something tokens

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I played a lot of Skee-Ball

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
And a lot of Street Fighter Alpha 2

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
5th Dream in our chat room says

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
VR without glasses

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Without glasses, sound like anything recent?

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I see what you did there

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Alright

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
That may be a very topical

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
And appropriate game of the week

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
It might be a lot

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Crazier than you think

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
There it is, a classic game of the week

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Hard driving

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
On various systems

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
But we're going to give it to the arcade

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Because the arcade one can nap in

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
And definitely not the Commodore 64

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Definitely not that one

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere, we're not done

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
We've got plenty more show to go

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
We're going to talk about Chrono Trigger

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Super Meat Boy, Valve, Indie Games

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
The 3DS, yes more

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
But we have some actual big news about it

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
So we're going to talk about all that when we come back with more

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio, so don't go anywhere

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
The show where every gamer has a voice

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
We're taping episode number 395

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Tonight, January the 2nd of

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
2011, it's our first show of 2011

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Rob Roberts here with you

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Over the next few hours, of course DarkSakura, Loki

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
And our special guest tonight, Gary here in studio

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Talking about video games and so forth

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
We're going to get into the rapid fire news

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
In just a minute, but first

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Some quick plugs for some other shows that we here

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
At OLR are branching out into

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
By the way, special thanks to the

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Forces that be at our website for putting the little

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Links now right there on OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
So if you're curious about some of the other shows

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
We do, they are all right there

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
So DarkSakura does a show, it's called

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Comic Insanity

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Talks a lot about comic books

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Yep, and we are dark until

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Next week, so we will be recording

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Again this next weekend

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
All right, the best

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Little Horde House in Azeroth

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
My little show about Warcraft, which by the way

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Had some Comic Insanity crossover this week

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Tiara was our special guest, or Maron Marvel

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
From that show, so it's a good one to listen to

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
It was actually a really good show this week I had to say

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
So check that out at

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Our link in iTunes

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
We don't really have a website yet, working on it

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
So search us in iTunes

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Horde House, H-O-R-D-E space

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
H-O-U-S-E, or we are linked

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Right there at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
We have a blog spot technically, but that's just what

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
We use to link our feeds, so we don't

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Don't take that too seriously

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Anyhow, that's that

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Let's get into some quick news

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Some rapid news, believe it or not

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
There was still some stuff that happened in the gaming world

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
This week, so

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Believe it or not, few things

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Christmas doesn't stop everything

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
So it was announced

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
This week at Pokemon Black and White

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
We'll be headed over to

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
North America on March 6

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
You'll be able to play with your

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Pokemans on that date

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
And of course the two versions

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Will have slightly different

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Themes to them I guess this time

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
The black version will offer

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Pokemon

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Looks like a Reshirium

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
And a setting called

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Black City, while white will contain

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
A lush green area called

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
White Forest

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
And will let you capture a Pokemon

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Named Zekrom

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Boy, they're having to get

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Creative with the alphabet soup on these

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Pokemon names, aren't they?

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
So

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Those are actually going to be

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Coming March 6

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
On the

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Nintendo DS

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Also

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Not really coinciding

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
With that, but next month

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
There's going to be some

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Pokemon downloads available

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
At GameStop and Toys R Us

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
This is actually happening between

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
January 30th and February 5th

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
At Toys R Us

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
You're going to be able to pick up

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Ash's

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Pikachu

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
A version of that character

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
With a special set of abilities at Toys R Us

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
I guess

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
He starts off at

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Level 50

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Cool, I guess

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Some other stuff you can check out

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Of course at GameStop

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
During

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I guess during different weeks

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
They're going to have different Pokemon you can download

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
January 3rd through the 9th

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
They have

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Raikou

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Looks like 17th through 23rd

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
And Tai

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
And

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Looks like

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Entei, I guess

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
31st through February 6th

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Suisin

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
That means nothing to me, by the way

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Because I don't play Pokemon

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Nor do I understand what any of these

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Really flamboyant

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Slightly mythological creatures

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
That almost looks like a dog

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
But if you want to be

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
The very best

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
No one ever was

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
You gotta catch them all

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
It's like STDs

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
To train them is your cause

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Gotta catch them all

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Uh

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Something that

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I'm not sure a lot of people may be wanting to catch

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Do you think antibiotics could

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Clear up a bad case of the Pokemans?

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I'm on a strong

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Dose of antibiotics right now

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
And I have no

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Urge to play Pokemans

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
So maybe

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Dynasty Warriors 7

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Is coming to North America

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
March 22nd

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And it will be, I guess, the first version

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
That will include 3D

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
And move support, of course on the Playstation 3

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
And I guess

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
The game will also be on Xbox 360

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
As well

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Some new stuff that's gonna be in the game

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Apparently they have a

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Free roam mode dubbed Chronicle mode

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
There's gonna be 60 playable characters

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
And I believe online co-op

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Is the other brand new thing

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
So yay

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
And then last but not least

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
As

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
A lot of games seem to

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Kind of go this route

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Devil Summoner Soul Hackers

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Is a game that I guess came out on the Saturn

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Back in Japan in 1997

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
It has not been released

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Over here in North America

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Or has gotten an English release anywhere in the world

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
I remember that game

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
So now

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
A group of hackers calling themselves

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Devil Hackers

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
What a friendly name

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
They're working on a fan made

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Translation of the title for

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
The PSP

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
And of course

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
They have a teaser trailer

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
For it, but it's like 13 minutes long

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
So that's a big tease

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
That's a long trailer, geez

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
That is a long trailer

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I mean, do we really need to watch a trailer of

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Like, hey look, the game's in English now

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I mean, this, I don't know

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
You know what, I hadn't heard about this game

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Until tonight, so maybe some people just need to

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Know about its epic epicness

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Maybe

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Hey, speaking of epic, Rock Band

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Is a very epic music game

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And there's an epic musician coming to the game

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
This week, and it doesn't get any better

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Than Johnny Cash, ladies and gentlemen

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Coming this week to Rock Band

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
And it's a big pack of

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
8 songs that you can get for

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
About, what is that

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
1080 Microsoft points

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
It's about 14 bucks and all said and done

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Cry Cry Cry

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Don't Take Your Guns to Town

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Five Feet High and Rising

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Folsom Prison Blues

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I Got Stripes

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
I Walk the Line

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Tennessee Flat Top Box

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
And the Ballad of Ira Hayes

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Awesome

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Also, if that wasn't good enough, Dark Soccer

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Free songs coming out this week

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Free shit

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
It is 9 songs for free

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
It's the Rock Band pack

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
It's just merry freaking January

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
There it is, 9 songs for free

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
They are all, of course, indie bands that

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Kind of have ties to harmonics like Bang Camaro

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
And you know, things like that

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
But hey, you know what, free is free

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
You might find some music you like

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
So there you go

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
By the way, also, some pro guitar and bass

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Stuff on some of those Johnny Cash songs

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Rob!

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
But only like I Walk the Line and Tennessee Flat

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Our friend has brought over the guitar

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
The pro guitar

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Well, I didn't get to see it used

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
But it was really nice

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
So many buttons on it

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Better be nice for the price that it is

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Right?

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
He seemed to like it

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I watched him playing stuff with it

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
It was pretty cool

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
I mean, not last night, but New Years

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
If you

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Like Rock Band 3

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
And you like Fallout 3

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Then this song is for you

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
And it's on the Rock Band Network

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
You're going to have to dig for this one a little bit

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
It's Kirby Crackle

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Doing the Fallout tribute song

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Vault 101

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And that's a little play on

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Where you start in the game

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Fallout 3

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
That's available on the Rock Band Network store

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
So if you like that song

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
There's a clip of it available on YouTube

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Rock Band isn't the only game

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Getting some download stuff coming

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Dance Central is still kicking

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
It is still going

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
In fact, actually it came out a couple weeks ago

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
But we were off for the holidays

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Let's see

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Rihanna came out with Disturbia

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Girls and Boys

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
By Blur

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
That's kind of cool

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
And Janet Jackson with Control

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Awesome

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Would you dance to Girls and Boys in Dance Central?

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I know you like your Blur

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Super Meat Boy

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
If you were waiting for this game on the Nintendo Wii

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
You are going to be waiting forever

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
That is because the Wii version of Super Meat Boy

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Is gone

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
What it boils down to

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
You can read a very interesting

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Press release or statement from the folks behind

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Super Meat Boy

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
But basically, the 40 megabyte limit

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Imposed on WiiWare games by Nintendo

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Means the Super Meat Boy version would have been

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Shit

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
There would have been tons of songs

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
The Dark World levels wouldn't have even been there

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Basically, you would have gotten a

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
And they called it this, a shitty version of Super Meat Boy

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
So it would fit right in with everything else

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Really

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
But what's kind of sad about this is that

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Originally, this was announced as a WiiWare game

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
And so they've had to do a little bit of backtracking

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Saying, hey, we know Wii originally announced this

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
As a WiiWare thing

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
But guess what?

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I think it was that Nintendo was really the first

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
To announce it

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Specifically for the Wii to begin with

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
They were just making a game and Nintendo kind of wanted it

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
And B

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
You know what? The game grew bigger

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
And it's a great game

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
And if you own a Wii

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
You probably have a PC somewhere in your house

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Even if you don't have a 360

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
At least you can get this game somewhere

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
The game will not be coming out on the PlayStation 3

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Due to an arrangement

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
With Microsoft

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
You can kind of read between the lines there

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Dark Sakura

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Well, Squeenix has decided

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
That they are going to

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Have another Final Fantasy game

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Duh!

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
They actually filed for a European trademark

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
For Final Fantasy Type 0

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
And has it under everything

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
From computer game software to toy swords

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
So

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Maybe it'll be cool

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Then we have new characters

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
For Tekken Tag Tournament 2

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
There's a Lutadora

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
And

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
They don't know her name

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
But she's pink!

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
She's wearing a rasslin' mask

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
She makes me think of Rainbow Mika

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
And it's a she

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
So maybe they're taking a page from Capcom's book

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
And then

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
In other news

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
There's actually a few more things

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
That are sort of cementing in

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
That the

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Previously rumored taskmaster

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Akuma and Sienkou

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Are going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And that's in the way of

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Xbox 360 achievements

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
There is one called

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
For those who dwell in darkness

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
And so that's going to be a team

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Composed of all Darkstalkers characters

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
So that means three characters

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
So there's going to be another Darkstalker

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
So far we just have Felicia

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
And Morrigan

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
So all the rumors are going to Sienkou

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
And then there's one called Fate of the Satsui no Haro

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Which is

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Which is going to be

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Basically the only other person

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
That Ryu could fight would be

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Akuma

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Because that's the only person in game canon

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Would have that going on

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Unless you count Marvel superheroes

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
What about the guy that's from

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Super Street Fighter 4

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
The one that was

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
What was it

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Not Shenlong

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Or whatever

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Oh, Gokun

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Like, it was another character

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
It wasn't Akuma

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Or whatever, it was supposed to be there

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Yeah, Gokun

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
There's Sensei, that's Gokun

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
And he doesn't follow that

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Oh

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Because he's hardcore badass and has cool music

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And then the other one

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Of course the rumor was Taskmaster

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Who, I'm like, dude, he's not even relevant

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Why put him in it, but

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I guess, but there's

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
There's supposed to be

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
More going on with that one

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
They also said there's

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Another list of achievements

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Among others are who will answer the call

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
And this achievement is

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Participate in 8 player lobby

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
On Xbox Live, so

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
There's going to be lobbies

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
So we also

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Get the Sentinel and

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Hagar are also rumored to be

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
In it, I'm just happy

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
That X-23 is in it, so

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
That's it

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Sounds like a definite purchase for you

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Than Dark Sakura

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Hell yeah

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
It doesn't even matter what character

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Deadpool

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I am sick of Deadpool in the comics

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
But I love everything else that has Deadpool in it

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Does that make sense?

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
No, but that's okay

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Twitter.com slash OLR

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Every week we ask you to show us your tweets

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And we will respond to them here on

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
The program

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
We're going to start tonight with a tweet

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Nathan Jackson on Twitter

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Question for OLR

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Is the Kinect going to fundamentally change

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Gaming to the point of abandoning

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Controllers completely?

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
I'm going to give that a big fat

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
No, because some people

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Like to touch things

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
They like that, and funny enough

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I think that's all kind of part of Sony's

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Marketing campaign is that

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Sometimes people want tangible things

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
But

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Here's case in point

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
There's only so much of the iPhone

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Gaming I can take because I don't have those

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Tangible buttons and the responsiveness

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Isn't always there for me

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I think they seriously need to

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Aren't they supposed to be unveiling

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
New stuff soon or something?

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I think MacWorld is coming up this week

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
This month

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
They seriously need some sort of controller thing

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Or something

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
It would really help

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Will it change gaming?

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Sure, this type of technology

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Has been slowly coming at us ever since

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
The Wii, I mean what you're seeing with

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
The Kinect is really just an evolution of something

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
We've kind of seen before

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
And it will evolve again

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
So is the Kinect

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Here to stay in gaming culture?

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Sure, but is it going to

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Eliminate what you know of games today?

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Nah, not until we have

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
The holodeck, once the holodeck's here

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Then it's all over, because remember

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
And I've said this on the show a lot

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Everything we do

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
And with every generation

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Is bringing us one step closer to the holodeck

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
For reals

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Once gaming reaches the holodeck

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
We're on the last generation of gaming

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Even then there might be a holodeck 2.0

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Huh, I don't know

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Alright, let's see, moving on with some other tweets

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I'm going to

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
DJ Rama S sends us a tweet

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Interesting

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
EA is being sued

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
By gamers

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Because of the football license

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Exclusivity

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
That they have

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
That's the story that he's linking us to

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I thought I heard about this before

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Maybe something has progressed with this

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I could have sworn I heard something about this before

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
But it was like years ago

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
But anyway, whatever

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Let's see

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
They're saying

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
We believe EA forced consumers to pay an artificial premium

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
On Madden NFL video games

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
We intend to prove that EA could inflate prices

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
On their sports titles

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Because these exclusive licenses

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Restrain trade and competition

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
For interactive sports software

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Because, you know, when NFL 2K5 came out

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
It was only 20 bucks

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
And EA had to sell Madden 2005

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
At 30 bucks

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
And then once the exclusive deal hit

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Well shit, those games just cost like 60 bucks

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Since then

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
They want anybody who's purchased

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
An EA football game since August 2005

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
To get damages in this settlement

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Which if it ends up being this whole class action thing

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Means every person will probably get 50 cents

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Hope you retained all your proof of purchases

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
For these 5 year old games

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Good luck

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
By the way, yeah, I knew this was old

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
It was originally filed in mid 2008

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
But, what's new about it

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
A judge has recently allowed

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
This lawsuit to proceed

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
I thought I'd heard about this before

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
It was just that long ago

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
But it's moving forward, it wasn't laughed out of court

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
So that could be interesting

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
A story for us

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
From TigerClaw305

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
About the

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Galaga World Record attempt

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Let's see

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Andrew Laidlaw

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Of Washington State

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Has claimed the Galaga

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Record, and he did it on

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
New Year's Day

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
4,525,150 points

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
As certified by

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Twin Galaxies, because you know

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
They carry the spirit stick

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
They say it goes, so they are the authority

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
On video game high scores

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
That was a record taken from

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Phil Day, who set a

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
3.2 million record in November

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Of 2009

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
He said, quote, the first time was magical

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
In a way, this time it's a huge

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Relief. Well, congratulations

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
A lot could be said about

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Sex, that way

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
I was gonna say, you know

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Ability to perform

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Under stress

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Oh, you crazy kids

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
That's gonna do it for the tweeters tonight

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
TigerClaw linked us another story, but it's coming up a little later in the show

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Also Spaznator is

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Not enjoying the changes

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
To the feed, because he's not able to tune in

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Remember guys, allgames.com

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Is really the best place for you to tune in

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
It is HTML5 compliant

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I think the only people that are getting screwed are the PSP people

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Because I'm not sure the PSP browser

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Supports the HTML5

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Hopefully there will be a solution for you guys

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Soon, but yeah

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
A lot of change-a-roonies going around at all games

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Radio, from what I understand

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Not bad stuff, just, you know

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
New year, new stuff

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Out with the old, in with the new

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
So some of the shows that are no longer around

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
They're gonna be replaced with some new live shows

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
So, you know, it'll be nice to have some new stuff going on

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
So with that comes streaming changes, et cetera, et cetera

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
So hopefully they get all that worked out

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
In the next couple weeks, and then we can update

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
All our fun little PSP stuffs

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
And get everybody back on board

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Mailbag is coming up in a little bit

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Mailbag at orangeontrader.com and Fuse of the Week

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
And of course the Skype line

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
But first, some more news

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Oh yeah, good stuff

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
So this is kinda neat

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
You know, Valve is pretty

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Kind of on the cutting edge with different things

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
They definitely put out a lot of popular games

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
And of course

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
One of the things that they actually have interest in doing

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Is providing

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Better experiences for those

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Who may be disabled

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
For example

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
One of the things that they're looking on to do

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Is with eye tracking

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
This would provide

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Ways for people that, you know, for example

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Don't have full body movement

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
To be able to play

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Without having to

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Use their hands

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Or their entire body

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
As an input device

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
And it says

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
It may be possible in the future

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Let the eyes act as the proxy

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
For the mouse cursor letting gamers

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Transmit navigation

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
And targeting inputs via eye movements

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
If you couple this

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
With the use of blinks

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And other proxies for button

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Predices, you may remove

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
The need for a mouse and keyboard

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Or gamepad altogether

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
So that's pretty cool

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
So, break this down for me

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
How exactly is that gonna work?

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
They're gonna have some sort of way

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
To track where your eyes are looking

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
And basically

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
They're gonna have some sort of system in place

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Where, for example, say

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
If I blink my eyes

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
A certain way or something

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Like a double blink or something like that

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
That it will act as a key press

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Or maybe if I tilt my head a little bit

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
It's meant for gamers

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
That have very

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Limited movement

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Who's that genius guy in the wheelchair?

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Stephen Hawking

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Stephen Hawking games

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Wasn't it

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I wanna say it's Atari

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
But I'm not 100% certain

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
It had this thing called a psychic controller

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
All it did was control

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
The mind thingy

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I can't remember the name of it

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
But it really just used

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
The movement of the forehead

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
And blinking of the eyes to do the control

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
It's the same concept

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
But now that the technology has caught up

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
That it could actually be

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
To track your retinas

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
An ultra-fine Kinect

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Oh certainly

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I think the technology has come up

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Well enough to make it something viable now

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
I'd hate to have that

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
With somebody with epilepsy

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
That wouldn't work

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
But it's a neat concept

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Especially though

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
With

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
I was thinking

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
There's other uses for head tracking out there

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
But that's really, I think, innovative

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
I'm all about

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Making games more accessible

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I don't know if this stuff could ever replace

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
But if it helps enable

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
And bring more people to the table, then hooray

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Then maybe people won't sue

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Well, you know

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
People will sue about what they can sue

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Alright

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Anyhow, Rama says in our chatroom

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
At chat.orangelandreary.com

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
I'm reminded of those special custom controllers

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Nintendo put out for disabled people to play their games

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Hmm

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I don't even remember seeing those

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
But of course

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
I never bought one

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
But I think I remember seeing it on a TV show

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Or something

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Anyway, moving on

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
This is something very exciting

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
What is old is new again

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Chrono Trigger

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Yeah, that's right, the old school

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Super Nintendo game

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Is apparently coming back all over again

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Sit down, it's not a sequel

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
But it's the inevitable

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Mobile version of the game

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
There's a teaser site up now

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
On Squeenix's Japanese

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Website

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
That apparently a mobile phone version of Chrono Trigger

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Is on the way

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Spring 2011 is the release

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Very interesting

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Now here's the thing to consider

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
If it's coming out of mobile phones in Japan

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Especially the way this thing looks

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
With the whole PSP style upgrade graphics

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
I'm really reading really far into this

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
But the font they use on

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
The 2011 Spring

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Looks like some of the fonts I see in the Final Fantasy remakes

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Yeah, I'm jumping way ahead with this guys

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
But the point is

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
It probably will inevitably come out for the iPhone

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
That was wordy

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Wasn't it? Probably will inevitably, whatever

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
It's probably going to come out for the iPhone

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
At some point, I just don't want to guarantee it

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Because I don't know anything

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
But hey, Secret of Mana just came out on the iPhone

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Did you know that on the iPad?

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I didn't like the way it controls, but that's just me

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Of course, because the controls on the iPhone suck

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Like, trying to emulate that whole control pad

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Just doesn't work

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
I have yet to see a game that it works in

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
The best iPhone games are the ones that

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Evolve either just tapping

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
And not like having to emulate a control

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Or tilting, like everything else

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Kind of blows

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
I will disagree

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
There are two games that it works on

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
And they're both cave games

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
One is for

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Espaluda

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Espaluda 2

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Having the drag

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Across there actually works very well

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
And the little controller thing from Ushihime Sama

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Super Bug Panic

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Actually works really well too

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Amiga777 in our chatroom says

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Hope they don't abandon like they did for Agito

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Oh, that's right, the Final Fantasy 13

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Remember that? Well, keep in mind Amigo

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
We haven't heard anything about Versus either

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
So it could still be happening

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Later this year

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
I have a feeling Final Fantasy 13 Versus

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Is going to be the big thing we hear about at E3 this year

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
From Squeenix

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
At least in the JRPG camp

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Because certainly they have the Tomb Raider reboot now

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Isn't that weird that the Tomb Raider reboot is a Squeenix game now?

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Kind of talk about this

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
All the different camps there

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
SalaciousPop in our chatroom says

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
They'll charge $9 for the ROM

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Just like Secret of Mana for iOS

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
$9 for an iOS ROM hack

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Well, hold on

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
You could kind of read into that

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
A couple ways

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Because I don't think it's really a ROM hack

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Because they do have to adapt it

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
For a different screen resolution

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
And they are putting those controls in it

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
$9 is still a lot though

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I mean, I hear you there

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
But those games will inevitably come down in price

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
It'll be $9 this month

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
$7 next month

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
$0.99 when there's a big sale

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
And that's when I will finally get it

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
At some point

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
And I urge you to do the same thing

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Savalas in our chatroom says

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Angry Birds is amazing on iPhone

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
iPad, iTouch

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
You know I still haven't played that game

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I've heard very mixed things on Angry Birds

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Angry Birds is

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Frustrating and fun

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
I've had it downloaded forever

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
And I still have not played it

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
And then they taunt you with their little snort noises

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Stupid green pigs

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
I've played some iPhone games

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
I've played that Smurf village game

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Finally

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
And I played that dungeon crawler game

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
That Loki gifted me a couple weeks ago

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
It was really pretty

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
But it was kind of hard to control

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Well I mean

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
It's still really pretty

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
It's probably better on the iPad

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I don't know, for some reason

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
You're so cramped on the phone

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
I would think on the iPad you might have a little bit better

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Oh I forgot to mention

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
They have Raptor Call of the Shadows

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
On iOS now

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Oh really? Remember that old shareware game?

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Oh wow

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
How much do they want for that?

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
I wouldn't know

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Alright

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Let's move on, Dark Sakura

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Meat

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Meaty meat meat

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Meat

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Actually

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Super Meat Boy is going to have some goodies coming out

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
More beefy goodness

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Meat

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
With the

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Next update

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
It's supposed to be a free PC update

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
There is

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
There is going to be

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
A level editor

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
An online level portal called Super Meat World

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
And something called

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Enter the Unknown

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
But with the editor you can basically

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Go

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Recreate anything in the game

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Except the bosses

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
You can actually determine

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Which characters will play the level

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
You have all kinds of different stuff going on

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
But you have to hit all the validation

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
To make sure that you can upload it

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
The online level portal

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Basically

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Is just lets you go check out all the levels

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
That people have made

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Super Meat World

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Is a big hub

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
And is

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
What's going to bring you new chapters

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
To the game

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
And it unlocks with

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
30 bandages

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
And pops up on the map before the first

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Chapter actually begins

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
And then Enter the Unknown which is exclusive

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
For the PC

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Picks a random user made level

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
And filters it based on whatever difficulty

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
That you picked

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
So

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Basically it just is giving you a random

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Player created level

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Based on the difficulty that you've selected

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
So pretty cool

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
That's pretty cool

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
That's interesting that whole random

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
S ability

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
It's Mystery Meat

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
That's what they should have called it was Mystery Meat

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
I like that

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Trademark that today

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
That sounds so wrong

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Super Meat Boy

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Worst title ever

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
And worst, yeah I've said this a million times on the show

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Worst little logo ever

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
But awesome game

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Bandage Girl

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
You've got to be kidding me

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
I know we never did an appropriate top games

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Of the year

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
But Super Meat Boy

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Definitely would have been near my top of the list

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
I'm showing

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
I'm showing Gary the beginning of the game

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
This is

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
This is real? Wow

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Loki dare I ask if you had

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
To pick one game for your game of the year

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Last year

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Is it possible? Red Dead?

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
That's what everybody else picked

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Red Dead was alright

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
I don't know

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I still play Grand Theft Auto though

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
But Red Dead was kind of cool

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
I don't know if I would say it's my game of the year

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Though

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Maybe

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
I can't pick one

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
That's why we didn't even try to do that

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
There was a lot of great games last year

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
So we just took last week off

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Think about it

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
I know a top contender for game of the year

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
This year is going to be

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Well what do you think?

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Earth Defense Force

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Insect Overgeddon

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
But see last year

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
I'm pretty sure I would have said on the end of the year

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Classy 14 is going to be the best game of the year

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Next year

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Boy was I wrong

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
I'm still going to say Star Trek Online

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Was my game of the year

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Unfortunately it was the game that only lasted

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Me a year

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Mine was probably

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Civ 5

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
He would say that

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Of course I would

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Anyhow

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Let's move on with some more news

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
We've got the mailbag coming up in just a minute

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
We've talked a little bit about the Xbox Live

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Indie Games Winter Uprising

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
It's a group of developers

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
That are putting out games on the Indie Games Store

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
That are kind of getting pissed

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
That there's a lot of crappy games out there

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
And a lot of clones

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
And ripoffs of other things

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Although

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
If we're going to really get into

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Nitpicking on the stuff

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Their games aren't exactly original either

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
But whatever

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
What's cool though is Microsoft has actually

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Put up a banner

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Or I should say a little

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Highlight spot

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
That you can actually check those out

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
From the

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Xbox Live Marketplace

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
They actually added to their spotlight

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
And

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
I believe now all the games have been released

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
That are a part of that

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
One of the few last ones here

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Cthulhu Saves the World

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Apparently came out

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Earlier last week

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
And then also they had

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Breath of Death 7

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Which was the last one

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Cthulhu Saves the World looks like it was made with RPG Maker

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
But yeah

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
You can check those out

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
And check out the

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Little link on Indie Games Winter Uprising

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Plus there's plenty of games out there

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
That really need to be checked out

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
And a lot of them

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Actually all of them have free demos

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
And they're cheap

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
A lot of them are really cheap out there

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
So check out the demos

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Buy the full game

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
What are the huge Indie Games

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
That I should be playing? Do we know of any?

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Cause I tried a couple and

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
I gotta admit, nothing that really

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Nothing that really made me want to come on the show and talk about it

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Haven't you played Carnivale?

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I haven't

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I was looking at that Breath of Death

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Whatever though, I was gonna download that

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
I just didn't get around to it

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
I think that's what it was called

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
It was one of the first Indie Games I picked up

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
And it's awesome

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
So good

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
It's kind of a game where you launch

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
This clown rag doll

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Thing into the area

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
And you collect balloons and stuff

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
But it's

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Really

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Kinda cool

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
I just like the art style in it and everything

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
But yeah, Carnivale

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
I'm trying to think of some other ones

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
That are actually pretty cool

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
There

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
There was one, oh god, what the hell was that?

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
There was one

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
It was

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
It was some sort of

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Obama

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Fighting game or something like that

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Oh dear

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
What the hell was it?

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
It was something ridiculous

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
It was some dude that

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Was

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Running around and there would be people

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Trying to attack you and you can

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Pick up a bus and smash them with the bus

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Oh, you showed me

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Videos of that, I remember

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
It looked like bad dudes or something

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
It was pretty funny

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Are you a bad enough dude to be the president?

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Nice

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Alright, well you think of some others

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
I don't know, I haven't really been on Indie Games

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
In a while, so

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
You'll have to remedy that soon, alright

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Well anyway, let's talk about

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
This is definitely not about Indie Games

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
It's about games that people are looking forward to

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Next year, the Nintendo 3DS

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Is a huge, huge thing of course

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
It's going to be about 2011

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Because everything has to be in 3D in this day and age

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
So the 3DS is getting a big

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Public showing in February

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
In Japan

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
3DS will also be at the World Hobby Fair

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
It's going to be at some Japanese shopping centers

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Crazy, crazy

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Excuse me, crazy stuff

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
But here's some of the games

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
That are going to be playable

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
At this exhibition

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Nintendo World 2011

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
The new Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Pro Evolution 3D Soccer

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Street Fighter IV 3D

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Resident Evil Revelations

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Dynasty Warriors Chronicle

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Dead or Alive Dimensions

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Oh man, Dead or Alive Dimensions

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Imagine those titties bouncing in full 3D

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
It's going to be amazing

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Ridge Racer 3D

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Nintendogs plus Cats

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Steel Diver Pilotwings Resort

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
AR Games and the Nintendo 3DS

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Camera

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Now there's some other stuff that is not playable that's going to be shown

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Kingdom Hearts 3D

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Super Monkey Ball 3D

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Puzzle Bobble 3D

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Star Fox 64

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Animal Crossing Mario Kart

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
So on and so on

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Probably the same shit we saw at E3

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
But maybe with a new coat of paint

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
I don't know

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
By the way, most people are predicting it will be $2.99

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
I'm going to say

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
I agree with that, $2.99

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
and the Zelda Ocarina of Time is the pack-in

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Because it's a huge

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
game without being

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
a lot of money

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
spent by Nintendo, you know what I mean?

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
I think that will be the pack-in game

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
The camera, the Zelda Ocarina of Time

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
3D, maybe some samplers

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
with some of these other trailers and so stuff

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Other stuff, but it won't be Kid Icarus

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
I'll tell you that, that will not be the pack-in game

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Alright

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
And that's just

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
I have nothing to go off of

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Just what I think

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Let's get to what you think in the mailbag

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
is a place to send your emails every week

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Dark Soccer will dive in the mailbag

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
and pick some of her favorite emails

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
and read them for us here on the air

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
I will

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
But I think the holidays slowed people down, didn't it?

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Yep

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
This one, the OLR 2010 Predictions Forum thread

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
We got next to nothing

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
and mine were all wrong

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
but thankfully so

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
I won't be posting

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
a 2011 thread this year

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
I would like to mention a heavily self-biased list

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
of some notable things that happened

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Don't include the stuff if it was part of your year-end wrap-ups

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
I'm gonna do it anyway

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Well, we didn't even end up doing your year-end wrap-ups, so there you go

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
2010 Slimeball Award

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Activision

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Dismantling of Infinity Ward was

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
so as not to pay bonuses

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
for a job while being gamefully employed

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
is not a reason to fire them

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
In fact, the games industry

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
will be best served

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
if you encourage career development across companies

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
The decision was very profit-oriented

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
and slimy

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
One thing I hope the developer studios should have learned

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
is to put in their contracts

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
that bonuses are paid

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
based on project, not employment

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
2010 Last to the Party Award

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Me! I joined Facebook in August

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
2010

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Developer of the Year, PopCap

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Their games are not hard-hitting, but they sure are fun

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
PopCap is really good at breathing new life

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
into old games, plant versus zombies on new systems

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
with new features, Bejeweled 3,

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Zuma's Revenge, and Zuma Blitz

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
2010 Welcome to the 21st Century Award

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Steam

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Steam made no-box direct sales of software

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
worth it with their great prices

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Think you shouldn't pay as much for a game

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
because the cost of packaging and media isn't an issue?

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Steam understands that

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
The newest games are pricey, but their sales

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
on right now make it affordable

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
2010 Best Use of Meat

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
in a Game's Title, Super Meat Boy

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
They managed to use the initials SMB

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
to hilarious effects

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
I'm looking forward to what you guys come up with

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Ra-ba-buh

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Ba-bom

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
That's cute

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Last one

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Dear Peoples of the Intertubes

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
You put out the call on Twitter for gaming-related

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
New Year's resolutions. Well, most of my resolutions

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
have to do with writing

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
My only vaguely gaming-related one

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
is to pay off my credit card, which I've

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
only used to buy my two-year-old

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
laptop. Besides, I don't make

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
resolutions as much as I make goals. Goals

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
tend not to have an expiration date that leads to

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
disappointment in yourself. Stay black, redertainment

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
This message was brought to you by

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Windows 7, which totally fucked up my

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
two-year-old laptop, sent for my iPad

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Well, you gotta have the money to buy the games, so

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Ah, good ol' reliable iPad

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
And if you pay off your credit card, you can always

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
run it all up again. Just kidding

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
You know what I have noticed? Don't look too crazy. What?

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
I have better luck sending emails from my iPhone

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
than I do my PC sometimes. Really?

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Because my iPhone has never crashed on me

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Alright, well let's get to the FUs of the week

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
I've had iPhone apps crash on me

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
just so you know. I've had apps crash

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
but there's no such thing as a BSOD

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
on an iPhone. Yet

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
But there is a such thing as the

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
alarms suddenly not working on the iPhone

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I don't know if you heard about that

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
It's not a perfect world

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.000
FU to my back and now my butt

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Because I was playing with my friend's son

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
and he's heavy

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
and I've wrenched my lower back

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
and it's since settled in my right side

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
I have a bad hip for the record

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
I've been in two car accidents

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
and injured my hip both times

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
and I'm in a lot of pain

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
I've taken significant Vicodin today

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000
significant, I won't say how much

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
and um, I still hurt

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
I'm walking around like I'm, you know, 90

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
and I don't like it

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Also, I FU'd to the tail end of this cold that refused to go away

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.000
which makes me very antisocial and bitchy

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Is that all?

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Okay, Loki

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
What's your FUs of the week, Loki?

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
My FU of the week would be to

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
I don't know, the weather

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
sucks

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
I don't really have anything

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Uh, Gary

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Do you have any FUs of the week?

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Things that are making you mad?

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
I would have to

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
agree with Loki on that one

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
the weather around here has blown goats

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
all days yesterday and today

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
I hate rain

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
but I've said that before

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I mean, other people will remind me

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
that yes, we need it

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
but still, it makes everything

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
especially driving more difficult

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
and

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
yeah, that's the only one I want to say right now

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
It can rain up in the hills

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
and trickle down here

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Well, it can rain, yeah, it can rain at night

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
when I actually don't have to drive

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
but, oh well, whatever, that's life

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
I don't think the environment cares if you're driving or not

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
I'm pretty sure it doesn't

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
but I'm still frustrated all the same

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Um, I would say

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
FU to

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Comcast!

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
My internet provider

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Comcast is evil

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
My internet is still dropping out

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
I came out to my house last week

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
to try to fix it

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
and I'm still getting

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
randomly dropped from the internet

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
which is affecting my Warcraft playing

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Sorry, you know

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Jamie and I have a mutual friend who has Comcast

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
and she's always complaining about issues with it

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
so I can feel your pain on that one

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Hey, at least the tech who came to my house

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
was really nice, but I kind of got the sense

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
in just what he was saying that

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
yeah, this seems to be a problem in Comcast's office

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
and I'm just really here to validate that there's a problem

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
You know, like

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
so frustrating

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
At least nobody came into your neighborhood and snapped the main

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
fiber optic cable

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
You remember when that happened to me?

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Well that's not Comcast though, that's just some jackass

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
That's some asshole

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
But anyhow, that's it for my FUs of the Week

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Just FU to the fact I can't run instances

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
and wow, because I always get disconnected

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Rude and ignorant

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Couple more news stories for you guys

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
and then the Skype line 877-GAME-OLR

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
but not just yet, we got two more stories for you

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Mikey?

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Yes, so

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
to kind of wrap things up

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
and this is surprising, thank God

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
I haven't run across it probably because it's in a different region

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
but Android

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
the marketplace is getting a few games

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
that are actually Trojan horses

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
that are letting

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I guess malicious hackers

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
possibly use your phone as part of

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
a botnet

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Apparently in China

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
on their app store, there's

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
I guess a few apps that are affected

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
by this. Monkey Jump 2

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Sex Positions

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
President vs. Aliens

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
and

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
City Defense and

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Baseball Superstars 2010

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
It says they found

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
these only right now on the Chinese app store

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
but they're saying that

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
it's possible that these may be coming

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
to the other regions

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
to just be on the lookout for them

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
It says

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Although the intent of this Trojan isn't entirely clear

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
the possibilities range from setting up

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
a malicious mobile ad network

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
to creating an Android botnet

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
They said that

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
they're just kind of

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
watching out. It says possibly affected apps

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
could be posted to the app stores

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
targeting US users

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
in the future

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
so just

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
be on the lookout

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
I worry about

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
the day something like this happens to the iPhone

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I mean Android's bad enough, there's enough people to use that

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
but boy oh boy when something like this

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
happens on iTunes

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
That's true

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
I mean everything does have to go through that rigid

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
approval process with Apple

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
but you just wonder when something's gonna slip through the cracks

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
It will eventually

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Of course they can always pull it

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
once it gets out there

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
I heard about that

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
What was the one

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
something about baby

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
oh it was really bad, it was something like

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
punching babies or something and somehow it got approved

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
it was really terrible

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Well some of you might feel a little terrible

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
about this and it's always interesting

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
to report on these type of like ROM

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
types of stories but there's a part of me that sits here

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
and goes okay seriously y'all this game

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
is like 20 plus years old

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
so let's talk about The Legend of Zelda

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
on the Famicom

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
or the Nintendo if you will

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
You know when it came out on the Famicom

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
it was actually a disc game

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
and we didn't have it here in the US but some of the games

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
for the original Japanese version

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
of the Nintendo ran on the

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Famicom disc system

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
so they were like these little floppies

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Well this week or I should say

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
over the holiday at least it did come to light that there was

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
a prototype of The Legend of Zelda

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
on one of these discs

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
so it was found and promptly uploaded

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
to the internet and you can check this out for yourself

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
it's a prototype of The Legend of Zelda

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Here's the thing though guys

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
honestly when I kind of heard about this I was like oh that's neat

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
that there's a prototype out there for such a big game

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
but not that much changed

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
they changed some sprites

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
slightly

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
it's almost unnoticeable

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
how they changed some of these sprites

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
like some of the guys that bounce around

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
didn't have whiskers before and they do now

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
I mean there's really little stuff

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
very very minor floor plans

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
some reconfigurations

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
but of course if you're a hardcore Legend of Zelda fan

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
and if you grew up with this game

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
it's kind of neat to see what once was

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
so

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
what's that? I'm downloading it

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
of course you are

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
it is available on this website

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
called let's see

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
it was originally put on this forums

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
at lostlevels.org

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
which I think gets into a lot of these types of

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
prototype issues

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
and I guess there's more information available as well

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
on a website called the Cutting Room Floor

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
TCRF.net

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
which is a whole little like Wikipedia

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
type thing that will detail all of the changes

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
if you really want to know what rooms

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
led different rooms and how the item

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
drops were different. I mean they get into

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
the real nitty gritty about

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
this. Most people will just kind of go

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
eh, neat, couple things are different

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
so

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
you know again if you're going to download stuff like this

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
though you should consider you know at least owning

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
a legitimate copy of this be it through

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Virtual Console or one of the

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
50,000 times Nintendo has released this

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
games be it in compilations or what

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
have you

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
but I say you know what

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
if as long as you have one of those

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
other games or you've had at some point in your life

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
I think you're entitled to take a peek at this

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
game.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Alright that is it for the

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
news tonight. We're going to open up the

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Skype line. Woohoo! Let's get some calls

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
877-GAME-OLR or

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
first calls of 2011 before

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
the delay is bigger tonight

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
so it's about a minute so do we have any

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
last minute stories while we wait for some calls to come in?

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
No but I was going to talk you were

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
asking about games that are good on the

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
marketplace and I was just pulling up some

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
that I thought might have been pretty good

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
one that I was really addicted

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
to Minor Dig Deep

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
was a really good one on the indie marketplace

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
and it's only a buck

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
this one looked kind of funny

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Try Not To Fart

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
It looked awful. I saw the box art

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
for that like how exactly

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
do you not fart? I don't I think

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
it's button presses you have to mimic the button

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
presses but they have like you know

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
like different situations eating dinner

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
with like your girlfriend's parents

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
or you know wedding

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
I remembered one of the indie games

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
that I played that was really really bad

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
it was called Maids With Balloons

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Oh I saw that! And it's

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
it actually has like live motion

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
video in it that they actually shot

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
like in some guy's spare bedroom and it starts

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
to look like a really really

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
bad homemade porno with

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
these three chicks and in

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
made costumes that really need to be dry cleaned

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
like just you know

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
like trying to be all like sexy and

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
so forth and

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
wow it was

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
it was kind of poop. Like I hate to

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
you know I know we're supposed to support indie

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
games and all that stuff but it's very

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
clear what this game is all about and it's

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
not the game. Sounds like epic fail

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Yeah Insiders

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Incite Lacrosse's college

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
was it College Lacrosse 2010?

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
That's a good one. Alright

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
let's get to the call. Hi you're on Orange

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Laundry Radio who's this?

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
It's Ron and yes SSJ 100

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Matt is correct I am the first one

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
of the year. You're the

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
first one of every goddamn show but you know what

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
here's what I say if you don't like Rama getting through

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
first every time they have Skype

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
on the iPhone you know

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
you can call us at Orange Laundry Radio we have a toll free number

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
for heaven's sakes there's plenty of ways

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
to get through to the show so if

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
you're the only one that wants to have your voice be heard

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
then so be it. What's on your mind tonight?

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
That and there are weeks when I let people

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
jump the line I don't even bother but

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
a couple of things

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
I'll be on my merry little way

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
now this whole court case

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
with the whole NFL thing I'm hoping

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
that the judge nullifies the contract

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
because damn it I want my tech mobile

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
NFL teams

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Ah that would be nice you know I think

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
competition is sometimes a little bit healthy

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
you know what really frustrates me to no end about this

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
whole Comcast stuff is that

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
there's no real competition

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
in this area I mean I guess

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
we're starting to see more and more AT&T

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
U-verse and some people would tell

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
me oh well there's DSL and I'm

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
actually getting to the point where I don't care if

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
DSL is like a fourth as fast as

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
cable I'm gonna fucking switch

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
if they can't figure this problem out

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
you know what I mean? I hear you

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
DSL isn't as fast but it's just more

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
dependable more reliable I mean

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
that's part of the reason why I switched to fiber optic

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
I mean yeah I got I had

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
cable but you know what when the cable

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
modem goes out at 12

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
midnight during off peak hours

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
for 5-10 minutes at a time

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I'm switching to something else

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
that's a lot better and besides

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
FiOS TV

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
pictures a lot sharper and a lot

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
cleaner than what cable vision was offering

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
I don't even really watch TV it's all about Netflix

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
and all that now but you know you live in New York

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
City too where you probably have more options

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
see being here in Sacramento

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
it's not that Sacramento doesn't have like you know

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
it's not like we're a potent town or one of the

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
I think what we're number 20 in the nation

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
or something like that but I live a little bit

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
on the outskirts of Sacramento so

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
I don't think I have as many options where I live

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I hear where you're coming from

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
because where I am my options are either cable

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
vision or Verizon

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
you go in certain parts of New York City it's

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
either Time Warner or Verizon

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
and sometimes it's RCN or AT&T

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
it depends on where you go

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
big wang eater in our chat room is saying

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
fucking switch, switch bitch

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
I will switch to eating

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
big wang that's why I will switch to

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
how long ago did you switch to that?

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
you opened the door

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
I plead the fifth

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I plead the fifth

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
well going back to the DSL

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
part of the reason the DSL is better than

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
cable is because with cable you're sharing bandwidth

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
with everyone on your block whereas

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
DSL just everyone in your house

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
it's a slightly more manageable situation

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
but yeah plus DSL

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
speeds are getting up to where they can compete

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
with cable's fastest speeds

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
first question I'm going to ask the DSL people is

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
can I play WoW on it?

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
that's all I want

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
and even with DSL speeds coming up

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
you have to pay more for it

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
but let's get back to gaming talk

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
yeah sorry

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
well hey it directly affects my games

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
it's not just WoW

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
it's Playstation Network and this whole

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
White Knight Chronicles being online enabled

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I can't keep a connection

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
it's getting bad

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
anyhow

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
so what else is on your mind my friend anything else?

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Arcade Infinity

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
now before we get into that

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
just so you know

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Colt 45

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
is a malt liquor not a beer

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
so if you're going to pour a 40

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
you're pouring a 40 of malt liquor

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
you don't pour beer

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
beer is tasty malt liquor

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
not so much

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
that's why I said

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
an ice cold Colt

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
can is the same to me unless it's Guinness

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
but Guinness is better out of a bottle truth

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
true that true that

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
even better on tap

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
that's true more truth

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
so alrighty

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Rama I'm going to go ahead and let you go

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
but wait actually one more question

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
because I'm going to ask this of all our callers tonight

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
your favorite game of last year using any

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
criteria you want there is no right or wrong answer

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World the game

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
because

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
it was the only game

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I played more than any other game

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
of all of last year it just

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
brought me back to my favorite

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
beat em ups I mean this is a game

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
where people would just come over

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
it was like the number 2 game in my house next to rock band

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
I want you to get people together and have fun

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
this is like I felt like I was like 10

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
11 12 years old playing

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
playing this game you know

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
nothing's wrong with that fun is where it's at

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
got that right alright Rama you have a good one

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
we'll see you next time

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
877 game OLR

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
or our username on skype is orange lounge radio

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
give us a call we'll talk

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
SSG100 Matt

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
in our chatroom says Guinness is a meal really

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
well yeah I mean well it's liquid bread

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
I suppose you could look

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
at it that way there's no other last minute

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
stories in house we've got nothing but calls

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
to go on

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
well I was going to make more recommendations

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
sure give us a couple more while we wait for some calls

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
shoot one up

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
that's supposed to be a really good one

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
and that's pretty

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
cheap explosion aid

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
was another good one that was by the guys that did

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
weapon of choice and really

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
cool looking shooter game here comes a call

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
legend nazaku here hello my friend

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
how are you doing

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
doing pretty good what's on your mind buddy

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
nah I know

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
adam mentioned arcade infinity you probably already

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
covered this to death but

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
the way I see it is that

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
I'm surprised it managed to go this

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
long given

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
the fact that you know round

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
one pretty much was there

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
pretty much was the

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
was a death blow to them

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
and don't get me don't get me wrong with

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
round one at least they're like an authentic

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
japanese entertainment center to an

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
extent and they're

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
they do a lot better than d&b but

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
I don't know it's like the arcades are

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
pretty much dead at this point I hate

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
to say it they're dead they're just not

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
dying they're they're pretty much dead

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
it's funny you bring up d&b

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
because I was at dave and busters this week

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
and it's still it's still kicking there's still quite a

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
lot of corporate owned I'm

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
talking about like mom and pop

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
operations like arcade infinity

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
I gotcha

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
like those on their way out

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
the rest of them are pretty much on death row

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
unless of course you're in

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
you know you have foot traffic but

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
yeah it's a disaster state of affairs now

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
it just

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
you know it doesn't make sense when

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
you know

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
I get

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
the way no I get what you're

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
saying you know sadly it's one of those things where you know

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
yeah we covered the story here and it was kind of one

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
of those oh that's kind of

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
sad but it's also not surprising

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
I mean that's just you're right arcades

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
have been kind of going this way and there's

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
there's not been a lot that's really made us

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
have to go oh we've got to go to the arcade and have

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
that experience because now we have

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
the internet you know and

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
even it's it's so weird

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
because OLR started because

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
of arcade culture and

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
that couldn't happen today

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
and it's kind of sad

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
in a way but even our little

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
arcade culture has moved to the internet

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
in its own little way and it's not

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
like the internet didn't exist then because we used to have

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
our own little forums the sacramentals

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
were our little DDR team and so

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
forth which wasn't really a team it was just you know

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
kids that played DDR but

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
you know it wasn't

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
like what we have now with

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Xbox Live I would

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
go so far as to say things like Xbox Live and

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
MMOs that's what really killed the arcade

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
right but then

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
again I've been hearing it

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
from other arcade owners that I know

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
that you know it's a dying industry

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
it's pretty much

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
on its days are pretty much numbered

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
and I know that I mean

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
somebody has to innovate somewhere

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
and of course I don't know what that answer is

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
or I'd be a freaking millionaire but

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
surely there is something where people

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
would want to do it in person you know what I mean

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
there's got to be something that will

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
get people I always want to do it in person

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
it's just you know

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
what I mean the folks who run

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
the classic arcades they're probably going to be

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
around for a while as long as that

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
as long as that generation of

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
folks who used to play those types

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
of older games even the newer ones

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
they'll still

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
be a place for those types of arcades

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
even ours even a place like

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
AI someone will

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
someone will step up eventually

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
and just you know pick up the torch

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
where they left off as well you know

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
as long as they're right as long as

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
they're like running a tight

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
ship I gotta say this

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
I gotta say this though too I mean let's be

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
real AI also

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
it was in kind of a shitty location

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
right round one it didn't

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
really have a lot of advertising

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
and I realized it was an independent thing but

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
unless you were kind of on the internet

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
I had no idea about this place

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
until I was like online and

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
posting on DDR boards

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
it's not even that I heard they were getting

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
flack from the city like they were

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
they were like really hesitant about

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
renewing their licenses wow

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
sad right and not a couple with

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
the fact that their landlord

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
you know raised their rent

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
constantly you know

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
raised their rent to the point where they were

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
gonna they had no choice but to be driven

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
out that you know and then round one

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
showed up so it was like so

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
many forces and the

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
they pretty much were

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
there were so many

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
aspects responsible for their demise

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
and it's like I don't

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
want to like clog up this precious Skype

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
time just debating it if you look on

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
those forums the fighting game forums

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
even your Bobani forums

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
you'll find the answers from people

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
who actually who have

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
more deeper knowledge than I do

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
that's what I hear let me ask you I've been asking

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
everybody else tends to wrap up and get more calls

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
what was your favorite game of all last

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
year any criteria you want uh

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
let me see

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
any criteria would that

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
be I'm thinking

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
I'm thinking bad company too

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
why is that because I think

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
just because of its crack like addictions like

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
especially the multiplayer

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
where it's all even though it's

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
team based it's just like on the PC

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
there's no ass hattery there's

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
like everyone helps everyone

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
fights no one quits

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
I wish there could be less ass

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
hattery in online games that is

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
one thing I would say Red Dead Redemption

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
but I just started that game a few days ago

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
that is one thing I will say that arcades

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
always kind of have over

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
uh the uh

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
online stuff is that online

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
you can hide behind your monitor but in

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
arcades if you're gonna be an asshole you have to be an

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
asshole to people's faces

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
that's one thing I do this at arcades

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
alright Zaku I gotta let you go so we can get more calls

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
have a good one buddy

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
I have a podcast where they discuss

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
the game but I haven't heard any of their shows

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
yet because I don't want to download iTunes

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
but um yeah I think yeah I've heard something like

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
that and uh my game of the decade is

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Grand Theft Auto IV I think

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
that's just one of the best games ever made

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
in my opinion I don't

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
understand where all the hate for it came

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
from you know

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
no Loki would be right there with you buddy

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Loki Grand Theft Auto IV game of the decade

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
possibly maybe

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
um it's pretty good

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
I don't know if I

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
yeah you had people complaining about the water

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
I think that was some of the best

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
computer generated water I've ever

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
slammed into the game and I can't believe people even

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
hated that I don't know it's just a weird

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
hate for that game I think when that's

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
like if you're complaining about the water

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
above everything else like really

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
that's kind of a stretch you know

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
I can think of games that have many more problems

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
than the water yeah they complain

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
about the water and the driving just because you couldn't

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
just you couldn't speed down uh

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
down the street at like 200

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
miles a minute you know

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
without uh you know they claim that

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
that was also a problem with the game I don't know I love the game

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
but anyway uh what else I want to get

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
to is arcades you asked about innovation

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
yeah and I think that uh

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
the way they'll probably be able

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
to save it is uh virtual reality

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
like some type of

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
apparatus that I know they already have something like that

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
but they need something where you'll have a

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
group of people that'll stand in it and there'll be some type of

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
multiplayer aspect I think that multiplayer

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
to the arcade will actually

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
be something that might be able to save it

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
so the holodeck

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
yeah yeah pretty much yeah the holodeck

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
that'll save

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
the arcades I think or maybe even

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
motion control I don't know

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
I find it kind of fascinating in a way that you're

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
calling in to talk about saving arcades and you

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
also kind of in the same sentence say

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
mag is the best game that you played last year

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
mag is very interesting

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
because it's it's

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
not an MMO

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
you can't really call it just some multiplayer online

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
game either it's like a

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
it's just it's a brawl

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
you know what I mean

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
yeah it's really great I mean

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
I think as far as

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
first person shooters go

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
that's the main reason why I like mag was just because

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
it was very innovative they were doing something

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
that you're not seeing in call of duty

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
that you're not even seeing in halo

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
and you know I just can't believe

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
how people just

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
knock any type of new innovation that comes out of

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
you know if the first person shooter is not call of

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
duty they knock it down

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
and you know

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
you know if the game is in

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
well what's the other big game that they

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
have out there that

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
people seen the

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
halo I'm drawing a blank

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
oh wow there you go yeah

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
if it's not wow it also gets shot down black ops

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
it's like you could only

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
yeah it's like you could only make those two games it's like you can only

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
make call of duty for shooters and you

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
could only make wow for

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
MMOs you know it's like the only

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
two games in existence in people's minds

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
I mean don't

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
get me wrong I like wow I think wow is great

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
but I've also played other MMOs

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
and I think you know they should also get

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
a chance you know I think they're

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
great games do you think there's a way

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
I'm just a gamer period do you think

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
there's a way to bring the magic of

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
mag and what makes that game exciting for you

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
to an arcade or do you think that

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
that 64 player brawl

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
experience is something you can really only do

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
online and only ever do online

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
I don't know you can bring something like

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
mag to an arcade

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
you couldn't have 128 people

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
versus 128 people but

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
you know you could probably have like a little

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
skirmish of like maybe

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
four people versus another four

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
people almost like a laser tag

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
you know what it could be

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
you could still use the internet in it

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
but it could be like city versus city

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
or something like that like you know

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Sacramento local

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
arcade could take on the New York

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
City you know

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
58th street arcade

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
I don't even know what's on 58th street I just pulled the number out of my ass

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
arcade you know what I mean like wouldn't that be

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
kind of cool like you could go like

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
yeah I agree yeah I agree with that

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
like I said my multiplayer is where it's at

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
man that's gonna save the

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
arcades if they want to save it I mean I gave

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
up on arcades after Street Fighter 2

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
came out on PlayStation I mean on

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Super Nintendo

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000

I don't know if I'd go that far

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Q100 Matt in our chat room says

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
people are doing that with Technica 2 now

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
they are battling with people for AZ

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
and CA see I like

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
where that's going that's a good start

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
unfortunately that's just one game

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
but alright

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
let's see let's go to another call here

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
this will be our last call tonight hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this?

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
hi this is Akdeft

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
hey Akdeft haven't heard from you in a long time

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
what's up?

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
nothing much you guys want to talk about

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
some games sure

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
what's up?

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
have you tried or have any of you tried

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
the

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
mexican wrestling game

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
AAA

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
I have not tried it

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
and I'm going to assume the other folks in the studio

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
probably haven't either but why don't you tell us all about it

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
I think if we knew more about it I think Dan would play it

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
well it's a

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
pretty interesting game

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
well basically

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
it's wrestling but

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
you have many

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
professional mexican wrestlers

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
and it's actually a pretty fun

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
game to play on multiplayer

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
is it like full on with all the theatrics

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
and masks and everything?

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
yeah oh that's awesome

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
yeah it actually

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
captures all the mexican

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
wrestling thing well

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
the action and all the

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
things that happen

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
on mexican wrestling the drama

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
yeah the drama

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
well basically

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
even the audience

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
plays a factor

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
well

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
plays in the game

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
not actually playing but

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
it plays a factor in the game

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
was this the game you were

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
telling us about previously that was actually developed in

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
mexico?

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
yes it was developed by

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
mexicans and columbians

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
I think

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
it was I think

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
published by konami

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
on the united states

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
awesome speaking of interesting

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
things published by konami I know this is

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
completely random but I have to get that out

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
at some point is that I was

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
at dave and busters over the weekend I think I mentioned

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
one of the things I played while I was there

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
it was a wheel of fortune ticket spitting

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
machine where you like guess the puzzle and everything

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
it was made by konami

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
couldn't believe it I didn't realize they had the license to do that

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
type of thing but they do a lot of arcade

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
stuff or uh redemption type of

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
things like slot machines and so forth

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
you said this was triple A

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
oh yeah

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
she's looking at a video here in the studio right now

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
of this game

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
yeah this

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
looks sick

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
triple A

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
or triple A

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
okay I think this

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
is immediately awesome

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
hmm

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
I'm just watching the intro of it that looks really cool

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
where's the gameplay okay I see that they

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
have some over the top wrestlers

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
oh it's the guy in the skeleton suit I love

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
that little creepy yeah he's called

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
la parka oh this is sweet

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
dark soccer is gonna be uh

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
getting her wrestling on okay

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
I actually like wrestling games believe it or not

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
cause I like customizing a wrestler

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
I think oh yeah

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
if you like wrestling games

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
you're gonna love this well we

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
used to get um all of

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
the uh the WWF or WWE

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
ones but cause the the big

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
thing about it is that because um

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
some of the publishing went overseas

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
is that they'd actually have some of the big moves from

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
some of the Japanese wrestlers

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
and we would you could

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
actually unlock like take all

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
these different parts and recreate

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
official you know Japanese wrestlers

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
in it and it was really awesome and

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
I remember okay do you remember WrestleMania

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
2000?

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
kinda for the Nintendo 64

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
yes I made this one

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
wrestler who was a

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
degeneration X guy and we had

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
him fight everybody and you know just

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
on like the watch mode and he beat everybody

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
including getting the women's belt

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
but

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
I also I like to do with those

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
games is just like make somebody and then just have

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
them go in watch mode on all of the

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
things I think that would be fun

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
alright Act F I got

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
one more question for you and that would be what was the

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
best game you played all last year using any criteria

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
you want?

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
I didn't play that many games this year

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
well last year

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
but I think what game that

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
I really found

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
interesting it was

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
it is

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
BB BB BB

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
or 6B

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
ah yes I heard you mention this in chat what was so great about it?

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
well it's actually

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
a pretty simple game

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
it's a simple platformer

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
though you control

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
you don't jump you don't

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
do any

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
spectacular thing like in Mario

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
or any platform like that

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
you control the gravity

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
you can go up or down

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
but you can't jump

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
or can't move

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
according to what you want to do

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
so you have to calculate

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
what you're going to do

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
if you're going to fall you have to

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
well

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
be very lucky or

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
some kind of

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
somewhat skilled

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
so you don't die because

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
many of the rooms are filled with spikes

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
that's why it's called

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
ah got it

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
interesting

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
it's also very cheap I think it's

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
$5 I think

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
and it's a pretty complete game

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
I think it's the best game

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
I played last year

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
simple jet innovative

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
alright great

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
I like hearing about some new games

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
and things that you know maybe some of the rest of us

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
missed so I think that's a great pick

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
alright buddy we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
but thanks so much for your call

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
thank you take care

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
alright that's going to do it for the skype line tonight

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
thank you guys so much for calling

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
sorry to those that didn't get through

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
it's always inevitable like it doesn't ring

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
for like 5 minutes and then suddenly it's ringing off the hook at the end

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
please feel free to email us

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
your thoughts mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
make dark soccer do some work

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
for next week

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
anyhow all joking aside

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
we got to wrap up the show and get out of here for the night

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
some of us have to get back to work tomorrow

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
bright and early

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
since I believe we are done with the last minute stories tonight

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
hey Gary thanks for being here

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
I know sadly you didn't get a whole lot of chance

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
to shout at us with the news

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
and everything with what's going on but

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
hey have a great week

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
and hope you get some more games and good luck with the

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
tabletop adventures too

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
I appreciate it yeah I wish I had more time

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
to play video games

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
there's a lot going on right now

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
hopefully I'll be able to get a hold of some

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
more time and some more games in the future

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
but yeah I want to finish Batman Arkham Asylum

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
before Arkham City comes out later this year

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
and I also wanted to try Transformers

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
War for Cybertron so I haven't gotten to that one yet either

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
I'll give you an assignment

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
for the next time you come on the show

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
at some point you got to find us that tabletop

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
game that you think is the most accessible to somebody

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
who's been playing the types of games

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
we play here that's going to be

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
a challenge to say the least

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
there you go there's your homework

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
okay accepted

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
we'll go to Dark Sakura

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Dark Sakura how you doing

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
did you have a good first show of the year?

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
I hope so yeah I feel slightly more

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
better

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
her spirits have been elevated well do you have a final

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
thought for our listeners tonight

grr argh

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
I don't want to get up at 6 am

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
I don't want to get up at 5 am

neither do I but I do sympathize

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
