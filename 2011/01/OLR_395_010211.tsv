26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet
33000	36000	And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	39000	We are that show where every gamer has a voice
39000	42000	Over the next few hours, we'll be talking to you about video games
42000	45000	And gaming culture, gaming lifestyle, all that fun stuff
45000	47000	A new year here at Orange Lounge Radio
47000	50000	Our ninth year, if you can believe it, of broadcasting
50000	53000	From 2002 to 2011
53000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts
54000	57000	And with me, as always, as she has been for nine damn years
57000	59000	Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers
59000	60000	I hate that damn dragon
61000	64000	We're gonna get to that in a minute because everything, like, changed
64000	68000	It's like, it's like a new, is it technically a new decade now that it's 2011?
68000	69000	Yes
69000	71000	Okay, so like, new decade, everything changed
71000	73000	Seriously, I'm gonna get to that in a minute
73000	75000	Nothing's changed, I brought this
75000	78000	Tech master Loki over there, interjecting his opinion, yes
78000	79000	Yes, Tech Master Loki?
79000	81000	Yes, I brought soup a few weeks ago
81000	84000	Remember, I had two large soups, I'm like, look, I have two soups
84000	86000	But tonight you brought four soups
86000	88000	Well, it wasn't intentional, I only wanted two
88000	90000	Instead of two large soups, he has four smaller soups
90000	93000	Which I think is still more soup than the, you know, it was before
93000	96000	Alright, and that's value
96000	99000	Now, I do have to introduce, always with us, the fourth guest on the show
99000	103000	Officially is our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
103000	106000	Or we are on the IRC network on Game Surge

110000	113000	If you want to do that, the real easy way, just go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com
113000	116000	But we do sometimes have guests in studio with us
116000	119000	Just to hang out and have some fun with us
119000	121000	Say hello to Gary is back tonight
121000	122000	Happy New Year
122000	123000	How are you doing, Gary?
123000	124000	I'm doing alright
124000	126000	You haven't been here in a few months
126000	128000	I seem to remember the last time you were here
128000	132000	Loki was out, so you were kind of a fill-in hosty type deal
132000	133000	Yeah, something like that
133000	136000	You're back tonight to kick off the new year with us here at OLR
136000	140000	We were off for the holiday break and all the December events that were going on
140000	143000	DarkSakura loaded her car and went up to Washington
143000	145000	How was your Washington trip, by the way?
145000	146000	That fun, huh?
146000	149000	It was alright, it was very...
149000	152000	I watched a lot of the DIY network
152000	155000	And Chiller, because they had a Buffy marathon
155000	158000	Doesn't Chiller also run the Twin Peaks episodes?
158000	160000	I have no idea, because I don't have cable
160000	162000	When did you watch on DIY?
162000	165000	House Movers, that was pretty cool
165000	169000	And I watched a lot of the home repair ones
169000	172000	I learned the quick way to add in drywall
172000	175000	Here comes Dan the man, the husband of DarkSakura, always present here
175000	176000	Am I on here?
176000	177000	Yes, you're on
177000	181000	Before you listen to her bitch about it, she also got to drink ridiculously expensive wine
181000	182000	I did
182000	187000	And she got completely smashed with my dad, which was hilarious
187000	189000	Your dad kept pouring me the wine
189000	191000	And you kept drinking it
191000	192000	And so did he
192000	193000	Anyway
193000	196000	And then he got an inversion table, so I'm drunk and upside down
196000	200000	It was kinkier than it sounds, with my dad
200000	202000	Shut up!
202000	203000	You are a bastard
203000	204000	Indeed
204000	206000	He was a smooth pimp
206000	209000	So before you let her go, oh, it sucked and I was bored
209000	211000	I didn't say it sucked
211000	212000	She had a good time
212000	214000	She got to sleep the whole way there in the back
214000	216000	I saw her vlogs, they were entertaining
216000	219000	DarkSakura is a vlogger now, with her little phones-y
219000	220000	And disturbing
220000	223000	And then Dan sitting there in the background like, hey, I'm Dan
223000	227000	I talked more on a couple that we didn't upload
227000	228000	Oh, bummer
228000	229000	Okay, well, I'm out of here
229000	230000	Alright, take care, Dan
230000	233000	So yeah, we do occasionally talk about video games here on Orange Laundry Radio
233000	234000	Video games, what the fuck?
234000	237000	Since it is a new year, let me just kind of reset the stage for everybody
237000	239000	If we happen to have any new listeners
239000	241000	So we're hitting the reset button real quick
241000	243000	Tell you a little bit about Orange Laundry Radio
243000	246000	Orange Laundry Radio started in 2002
246000	251000	I have a college radio background and DarkSakura and I used to do stuff with another show called
251000	255000	Undersedation Live, which is still up and running on the All Games Network on Saturday nights
255000	259000	But we decided to start a show that was kind of talking smack about video games
259000	262000	And what I mean by that is that DarkSakura, myself, and Loki
262000	266000	We actually all met at a arcade locally here
266000	268000	Playing, believe it or not, Dance Dance Revolution
268000	269000	We used to be obsessed with that game
269000	270000	I was never skinnier
270000	272000	Oh, no, no, no, Rob, Rob
272000	274000	For us, it was Parapara
274000	276000	A little bit of that, too, and Beatmania
276000	278000	And a lot of those music-based video games
278000	281000	So for a very long time, before there was even podcasting
281000	285000	We had a show on Live 365 dedicated to music games
285000	287000	And the music from them and so forth
287000	290000	So things have evolved, podcasting happened
290000	293000	And, you know, music games kind of faded out
293000	295000	Then they came back in a different way
295000	298000	And now they're kind of going, you know, things go up and down
298000	300000	And kamami said no one would like them
300000	302000	Yeah, so anyway, we're here
302000	303000	Silly, silly people
303000	306000	We're talking about kind of the rest of the video games
306000	308000	Of course, we still have a fondness for music video games
308000	309000	But we talk about role-playing games
309000	310000	Meat
310000	311000	Even first-person shooters
311000	312000	And meat
312000	313000	We might get to tonight
313000	314000	And of course
314000	315000	Meat
315000	316000	Food games
316000	317000	Iron Chef, for we
317000	318000	I'm going to make a sandwich in a moment
318000	320000	And I'm going to make a turkey and cranberry sandwich
320000	321000	And it's going to be amazing
321000	324000	The secret ingredient, Iron Chef, the game is suck
327000	328000	All right, anyhow
328000	329000	So that's our little show
329000	331000	So welcome, thanks for joining us
331000	333000	And of course, we do plug ourselves as the show
333000	335000	Where every gamer has a voice
335000	339000	And we do mean that, you know, this show was started with a bunch of us
339000	341000	Kind of sitting around after a night at the arcade
341000	343000	We used to go to this little restaurant called Brookfield's
343000	346000	That was in the parking lot of the arcade where we all played at
346000	347000	And we would have
347000	348000	Old people food
348000	350000	Well, but awesome mozzarella sticks
350000	352000	So we'd always kind of dine on mozzarella sticks
352000	354000	And talk smack about the games we just played
354000	356000	So that's kind of what we try to emulate here
356000	360000	Via our chat room, via the Skype line, via Twitter, via email
360000	362000	Via Carrier Pigeon, if you can figure out how to get one here
362000	363000	Rick's Glass of Merlot
365000	366000	All right, anyhow
366000	369000	Let's talk about games and your gaming week
369000	372000	We were off last week because of Decemberween or whatever
372000	373000	Yeah, Decemberween
373000	374000	Whatever it is you celebrate
374000	377000	Festivus, Christmas, Kwanzaa, all of it
377000	380000	All of it was an excuse to have last week off
380000	382000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
382000	385000	Well, I played a lot
385000	390000	Actually, I played a lot of Mushihime Sama Bug Panic
390000	392000	Thank you so much, Loki
392000	394000	That game is so freaking fun
394000	398000	And seriously, it's like mix of cave shooter and an adventure game
398000	400000	And it's bullet hell on feet
400000	403000	It's fun, it's super fun
403000	405000	And so I played a ton of that
405000	410000	And I feel dirty
410000	411000	I feel dirty, Rob
411000	413000	Why? Why do you feel dirty?
413000	414000	Wow
414000	417000	DarkSakura started playing World of Warcraft
417000	418000	Oh my god, you guys
418000	421000	It's like a total turnaround from her stance two weeks ago
421000	424000	And I gained 30 levels in four days
424000	429000	Okay, so before everybody starts yelling at you
429000	432000	Scab defector, you suck
432000	437000	What is it, what's the magic that's there now that wasn't there for you last time?
437000	439000	More to do
439000	441000	Shut up
441000	443000	You get the hell out
443000	445000	You get the hell out
445000	447000	You are not on, no, no
447000	449000	I'd like to give an F you to Rob
449000	451000	For the whole fucking Warcraft thing
451000	453000	I'm not having it in my house
453000	455000	She can play for a while
455000	457000	Then she's gonna get all addicted
457000	459000	And I'm gonna get a fucking divorce
459000	461000	It's your fault, Rob
461000	462000	It's not my fault
462000	463000	I'm gonna kill you
463000	465000	Tiara plays too, blame her
465000	467000	I don't like Tiara, oh I like her
470000	472000	You can get the hell out
472000	474000	Should we call the police right now?
474000	476000	There's about to be a domestic disturbance
476000	478000	At least it's all captured
478000	480000	Here on the radio
480000	482000	Dan was in here doing the happy dance
482000	484000	While I blithely flipped him off
484000	485000	Alright
485000	487000	It was funny
487000	491000	It has more to do now, I guess
491000	493000	Keep in mind, I love Star Trek Online
493000	495000	I freaking love it
495000	497000	But I was running out of stuff to do
497000	498000	I was seriously getting bored
498000	500000	And they'd put in episodes
500000	502000	And I would just wait and do
502000	504000	All of the portions of the episode
504000	506000	At once, and then I would be done with it
506000	508000	And I'm like, okay, what do I do now?
508000	511000	And even some of the missions are now broken
511000	514000	And as much fun as I was having
514000	516000	I was like, I'm kinda done
516000	518000	What more can I do?
518000	520000	So I thought that the changes were really exciting
520000	522000	But really all I ever do is go in there
522000	524000	Talk to my friends and play Dabo
524000	526000	That's it
526000	528000	So I was like, you know
528000	530000	The door of opportunity swung open
530000	532000	So I gave it a try
532000	535000	Even after I was damn determined to play this game
535000	537000	Because it did not want me to
537000	539000	I defied
539000	541000	Every power
541000	543000	That tried to prevent me from playing this game
543000	544000	Meaning?
544000	546000	Meaning that my stupid
546000	548000	The loader.exe was reading
548000	550000	Badly with Windows
550000	551000	So I had to rename it Bob
551000	553000	And then it worked
553000	556000	No seriously, I tried every freaking thing
556000	558000	I ran safe mode with networking
558000	560000	I did all of this crap
560000	562000	And finally I'm like, fuck you, I'm naming you Bob
562000	564000	And it worked
564000	566000	Wasn't there a program back in the day called Microsoft Bob?
566000	568000	I have no idea
568000	570000	Isn't that like the reason we have Comic Sans in the world now?
570000	572000	Ooh, yeah
572000	574000	By the way, I've gotta go to our chat room
574000	576000	You know they are the always present guests here on the show
576000	578000	They're not allowed to talk
578000	580000	Black Wolf, addict
580000	582000	Act Deft, sell out
582000	584000	Bojigawa, addict
584000	586000	Jesus, let's just pop in our chat room
586000	588000	I was fine with my spouse's
588000	590000	Sleeping pill and QVC addiction
590000	592000	But I will not abide World of Warcraft in this marriage
592000	594000	Wow
594000	596000	Well I think, is he trying to say that you're addicted
596000	598000	Alan Hart
598000	600000	Is he trying to say that you're addicted to sleeping pills and QVC?
600000	602000	I am not
602000	604000	Dan admitted to me earlier today
604000	606000	That he used to stay up late
606000	608000	In his high school years
608000	610000	Watching the Home Shopping Network
610000	612000	What other good shit about
612000	614000	I was in fifth grade
614000	616000	And I stayed up all night watching Home Shopping Network
616000	618000	Because I was up late
618000	620000	And it made me feel like somebody was up with me
620000	622000	So I wouldn't be lonely
622000	624000	Pathetic, huh?
624000	626000	And it's hilarious because they're so stupid
626000	628000	I love watching them sell a computer
628000	630000	You press this button
630000	632000	And it does stuff
632000	634000	It comes with a free printer
634000	636000	Didn't know your show was going to be a confessional tonight
636000	638000	I know, it's like
638000	640000	We're cleaning the slate for New Years
640000	642000	It's a confessional tonight on Orange Lounge Radio
642000	644000	Get everything off your chest
644000	646000	So that this new decade
646000	648000	Can be a relieving one
648000	650000	Amen to that
650000	652000	But, well I am going to say
652000	654000	That I have now made it from
654000	656000	One side of the continent
656000	658000	To the other
658000	660000	On whatever freaking continent that is that you took me to
660000	662000	Actually, first of all
662000	664000	You took me to this giant tree
664000	666000	And then I jumped off, died
666000	668000	And then respawned at the bottom of the tree
668000	670000	So that I wouldn't have to figure out how to get off of it
670000	672000	And then just ran across the water
672000	674000	And then I've been
674000	676000	Running all over the continent
676000	678000	And it's been kind of fun because I've actually kind of
678000	680000	Been getting into the story
680000	682000	And getting into the lore of the game
682000	684000	It's been, now that I'm actually
684000	686000	Getting to see more of the story
686000	688000	Because that was one of the big things that I liked about Star Trek Online
688000	690000	As I was going through
690000	692000	All of the ranks and stuff
692000	694000	You get more of the story and I was like
694000	696000	Well it's really fitting in well with Star Trek Universe
696000	698000	And then I just got to this point like
698000	700000	What? Why are we fighting the Davidians?
700000	702000	They were the lamest
702000	704000	Brain sucking
704000	706000	Interdimensional creatures ever
706000	708000	It really
708000	710000	Except that they gave me the cool Silent Hill thing
710000	712000	So that was cool but
712000	714000	I accidentally ran into an instance and got killed
714000	716000	That has to happen at least once I think
716000	718000	It was the one that was underwater
718000	720000	Like with all the underwater people
720000	722000	Sounds like Black Fathom depths
722000	724000	That was it
724000	726000	That was it
726000	728000	Oh it's sad I know that
728000	730000	And now I'm in some place called the Battle Scar
730000	732000	And I couldn't find the damn flag
732000	734000	And then I just gained a level
734000	736000	Congrats, so what level are you now?
736000	738000	I know you're gonna do it
738000	740000	37
740000	742000	In a row?
742000	744000	But I think I've done okay
744000	746000	For myself because I've gotten there
746000	748000	In technically
748000	750000	Six days of playing
750000	752000	Right?
752000	754000	You've been jamming right along
754000	756000	Bochi Kawa in our chatroom says
756000	758000	Everyone jumps off of Teladrasil, it's normal
758000	760000	Is it like the Golden Gate?
764000	766000	Lumi's in our chatroom says
766000	768000	I hope we have another
768000	770000	I Slept with a Forum Troll reveal
770000	772000	I don't know
772000	774000	Gary, have you ever slept with a forum troll?
774000	776000	No
776000	778000	Well we had a guest a couple weeks ago that
778000	780000	Apparently had so
780000	782000	The only thing that forum trolls
782000	784000	Are fit for is machine gun targets
784000	786000	Alright
786000	788000	Seriously though
788000	790000	But I got a melodica
790000	792000	Which has nothing to do with games but I love Marisa forever
792000	794000	Would you learn how to play Still Alive on the melodica
794000	796000	And play it for us one night?
796000	798000	Wow that was random
798000	800000	I could probably figure it out over the course of the show
800000	802000	That's okay we don't need to hear you rehearsing
802000	804000	Throughout the next three hours
804000	806000	If you have nothing else gaming to report
806000	808000	No I did other stuff
808000	810000	I remember so fucking
810000	812000	We've had a bunch of maim going on in the front room all day
812000	814000	I heard they were playing Moonwalker when we got here
814000	816000	Because all I could hear was
816000	818000	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
818000	820000	No no wait I had to go
820000	822000	Ouch
822000	824000	And yeah
824000	826000	They've had the maim fest going on
826000	828000	And Dan has a new steering wheel
828000	830000	For Gran Turismo 5
830000	832000	I'm never gonna call
832000	834000	Wow Player an addict again
834000	836000	I'm gonna call Dan an addict
836000	838000	It's a Bobby Blackpool
838000	840000	Joke
840000	842000	Bobby is convinced that Gran Turismo 5 is not out
842000	844000	Because he's not seen it on a store shelf anywhere
844000	846000	But your husband somehow has it
846000	848000	You know what I can verify that it is out
848000	850000	Because sometimes I hear Dan yelling at it
850000	852000	That though
852000	854000	And the biggest thing that I'm gonna give it
854000	856000	Is that it has the top gear track
856000	858000	And it has the Stig
858000	860000	So it's instantly
860000	862000	In my cool book forever
862000	864000	Because I freaking love the Stig
864000	866000	He listens to all kinds of interesting music
866000	868000	And he may or may not be an alien
868000	870000	Okay
870000	872000	Let's go to Loki
872000	874000	Loki how was your gaming week?
874000	876000	It was okay
876000	878000	I didn't play a whole lot
878000	880000	Just playing the same stuff
880000	882000	I've been working on Grand Theft Auto stuff
882000	884000	Just doing construction stuff
884000	886000	With the mods
886000	888000	Then also of course
888000	890000	I've been playing some
890000	892000	iPod games
892000	894000	Including
894000	896000	Some of these aren't exactly new
896000	898000	Actually most of these aren't new
898000	900000	But they're very similar types of games
900000	902000	Cannibalt and I Must Run
902000	904000	Both actually pretty much similar to Cannibalt
906000	908000	Based off the Flash game
908000	910000	Where you run and have to jump over pits
910000	912000	And stuff like that without dying
912000	914000	And keeps getting faster and faster
914000	916000	I Must Run they try to add kind of a story to it
916000	918000	And it's kind of neat
918000	920000	And I like the presentation of it
920000	924000	It's like some time traveling game
924000	926000	That sort of reminds me of the art style
926000	928000	Of like Feel the Magic
928000	930000	So that's kind of cool
930000	932000	And then
932000	934000	Also played
934000	936000	More Swords and Poker 2
936000	938000	Which unfortunately is not on
938000	942000	The app store anymore
942000	944000	The first one, Swords and Poker 1
944000	946000	But thankfully though
946000	948000	I have a jailbroken iPod
948000	950000	So I don't have that problem
950000	952000	And I'm glad
952000	954000	Because those games are very addicting
954000	956000	And then also
956000	958000	I don't know if you noticed
958000	960000	But there was
960000	962000	Some new stuff actually coming on
962000	964000	The app store
964000	966000	It was pretty cool
966000	968000	They had one of the
968000	970000	Tails games actually
970000	972000	Is now on the app store
972000	974000	So if you're a fan of that series
974000	976000	You might want to check that out
976000	978000	It was a Super NES Tails game
978000	980000	It was
980000	982000	Let's see here
982000	984000	Which Tails game was it?
984000	986000	Tails
986000	988000	I guess
988000	990000	Tails of Weaver
990000	992000	Lucian Cult
992000	998000	But I guess it's based on the MMORPG
998000	1000000	But it looks like
1000000	1004000	A nice 16-bit RPG
1004000	1006000	You know
1006000	1008000	I will say even though you've been kind of slowly
1008000	1010000	Going this way over the past six months
1010000	1012000	Maybe the biggest change for 2011 isn't the fact
1012000	1014000	That Loki is not bringing bacon
1014000	1016000	Pizza to the show but the fact that
1016000	1018000	I would have never said two years ago
1018000	1020000	That Loki would be the one here reviewing games that are out on the
1020000	1022000	iTouch
1022000	1024000	Call me crazy but if you've listened to Loki's
1024000	1026000	Diatribes in the past on Apple
1026000	1028000	I've already told you though
1028000	1030000	I understand
1030000	1032000	It's still a little bizarre
1032000	1034000	It's max not the i things
1034000	1036000	See the i things
1036000	1038000	They are expensive but they're good
1038000	1040000	And the max
1040000	1042000	The max are fucking expensive
1042000	1044000	They're not good
1044000	1046000	You don't get very good value for what you
1046000	1048000	Purchase
1048000	1050000	I would hope that if I'm spending $2,000
1050000	1052000	On a laptop that I'm getting something
1052000	1054000	More than just one USB drive
1054000	1056000	I don't care if it's paper thin
1056000	1058000	I want a fucking computer that can do something
1058000	1060000	That's just my opinion
1060000	1062000	But hey you know what
1062000	1064000	Teach their own and some people will buy
1064000	1066000	Max stuff forever and honestly
1066000	1068000	I spent no money on this
1068000	1070000	I had a stupid gift card that they gave me
1070000	1072000	It was either that or
1072000	1074000	Buying a bunch of Apple TV's
1074000	1076000	That throw out a window or something
1076000	1078000	I will say that max are still
1078000	1080000	Great for the graphics but now
1080000	1082000	That Adobe's figured out that
1082000	1084000	There's really a lot of PC users out there
1084000	1086000	I have no need
1086000	1088000	To have a Mac anymore
1088000	1090000	They have pretty monitors
1090000	1092000	But those monitors have their old
1092000	1094000	God I want one of those gorgeous
1094000	1096000	Gigantor monitors
1096000	1098000	Oh my god that would be so amazing
1098000	1100000	I would need new underwear every day
1100000	1102000	They're pretty nice
1102000	1104000	Our graphics department has
1104000	1106000	Some of those and they're nice
1106000	1108000	But once again it's a monitor
1108000	1110000	And I'm sure that monitor is way overpriced
1110000	1112000	For what it is
1112000	1114000	So I just
1114000	1116000	I could buy a TV and hook it up
1116000	1118000	And it would cost less than the monitor
1118000	1120000	See like I have my
1120000	1122000	iPod which I can browse the web
1122000	1124000	And stuff if I have a wifi spot
1124000	1126000	And I have my phone which you know I can
1126000	1128000	Browse the web too with that but honestly
1128000	1130000	I hate my phone's web browser
1130000	1132000	It's terrible and it's
1132000	1134000	Slow
1134000	1136000	I have an Android phone
1136000	1138000	But it's
1138000	1140000	It's a virgin mobile prepaid
1140000	1142000	Android phone
1142000	1144000	I don't think it's like a super android
1144000	1146000	Android that plays snake
1146000	1148000	Yes
1148000	1150000	But it is an
1150000	1152000	Android that I was able to root and
1152000	1154000	Add a thing to
1154000	1156000	Allow me to tether
1156000	1158000	To it so I just tether this
1158000	1160000	To it and I'm able to browse the web
1160000	1162000	And I love it and it's great
1162000	1164000	And I use this actually a lot now
1164000	1166000	To you know browse the web and check
1166000	1168000	My mail or whatever instead of
1168000	1170000	Having to go to my computer boot it up and do
1170000	1172000	All that stuff and then just it's a lot
1172000	1174000	Quicker I just do it on here
1174000	1176000	But see that's the only thing I have I like going for
1176000	1178000	It cause I mean this is
1178000	1180000	Arguably the top
1180000	1182000	There's no I mean Zune's
1182000	1184000	They're alright but there's no
1184000	1186000	Yes but there's no like
1186000	1188000	You know there's not really
1188000	1190000	Any iPod
1190000	1192000	Competitors out there that are kind of close to it right now
1192000	1194000	Can't say the same though for Max
1194000	1196000	Max I'm sorry it's just there's
1196000	1198000	There's competitors everywhere and they're just beating the
1198000	1200000	Crap out of them
1200000	1202000	Other computers are you know they've
1202000	1204000	Gotten the form factor really small but
1204000	1206000	I'm sorry it's just
1206000	1208000	That's not important to me
1208000	1210000	So Loki would you say
1210000	1212000	The description of a Mac is an overpriced fashion
1212000	1214000	Accessory true or false
1214000	1216000	Or something else
1216000	1218000	They buy into the brand and not
1218000	1220000	Necessarily it's for people
1220000	1222000	They've
1222000	1224000	Kind of marketed them as PCs
1224000	1226000	They're easy to use or laptops
1226000	1228000	They're easy to use and it's they're kind of
1228000	1230000	People don't want to try to
1230000	1232000	Learn stuff and they trust the
1232000	1234000	Apple brand because it's been around forever
1234000	1236000	And unfortunately people are willing
1236000	1238000	To spend a lot of money for that
1238000	1240000	This is the impression I get and I'm probably going to piss some
1240000	1242000	Mac fans off but you know oh well
1242000	1244000	I had an Apple
1244000	1246000	Laptop it only lasted me a year but
1246000	1248000	I had it but anyway
1248000	1250000	I kind of get the sense that
1250000	1252000	Apple a lot of their systems
1252000	1254000	Why I don't know why we've turned into this Mac versus PC
1254000	1256000	War but
1256000	1258000	Really preference I mean if you want to buy one
1258000	1260000	Go ahead but Macs are kind of like PC
1260000	1262000	Consoles to me and I think sometimes that's the
1262000	1264000	Advantage of them is that a lot of the software is
1264000	1266000	Very much customized for the Mac
1266000	1268000	Because their library is
1268000	1270000	A little more limited than what you see on the PC
1270000	1272000	And the expandability and
1272000	1274000	Customizability well yes I understand you can do some
1274000	1276000	Of it with Apple they're not all over the
1276000	1278000	Fucking map like PCs are like
1278000	1280000	There's zillions and zillions of
1280000	1282000	Different types of PCs but there's only so many types
1282000	1284000	Of Macs and I think the software
1284000	1286000	By nature kind of is
1286000	1288000	A little more optimized and runs a little better
1288000	1290000	On Macs the app store coming to the Mac
1290000	1292000	Is a great idea because
1292000	1294000	You know at least then you have a lot of
1294000	1296000	Different programs and tools and stuff that people
1296000	1298000	Can just fill
1298000	1300000	Their computer with like I have with my
1300000	1302000	iPod so
1302000	1304000	I think that's a good idea and they'll really fit with it
1304000	1306000	But once again it's basically just
1306000	1308000	Like hey look it's just a more expensive
1308000	1310000	iPad or something now it's a computer
1310000	1312000	iPad you know
1312000	1314000	I don't know it's just but iPads
1314000	1316000	Are so cute last time I used
1316000	1318000	Anything from Apple it crashed on me
1318000	1320000	I don't know
1320000	1322000	Alright well let's get let's get off the Apple
1322000	1324000	PC stuff and continue with our gaming
1324000	1326000	Weeks I don't know if Loki has anything else
1326000	1328000	But if no just grant them though but I don't we
1328000	1330000	Don't need well what else is new let's go over to
1330000	1332000	Gary what types of video games you've been
1332000	1334000	Playing lately
1334000	1336000	Well Dark Sakura's husband's been
1336000	1338000	Kicking my ass thoroughly on Street Fighter
1338000	1340000	For Super Turbo
1340000	1342000	Yes well
1342000	1344000	That goes without saying I just started
1344000	1346000	Playing it thank you I just said that
1346000	1348000	I can't that he can't help that he's
1348000	1350000	Not good at it that's because I haven't played it
1350000	1352000	Since I was in junior high thank you
1352000	1354000	And I've
1354000	1356000	Also yeah yeah yeah
1356000	1358000	I also just started playing Batman Arkham
1358000	1360000	Asylum finally
1360000	1362000	Which the graphics are wow
1362000	1364000	And yeah
1364000	1366000	I know I'm trying to come lately to that party but
1366000	1368000	It's still something I haven't
1368000	1370000	Attached the game oh okay
1370000	1372000	Well I feel a little bit better but still
1372000	1374000	It's a fun
1374000	1376000	Game I'm told that you can beat it in about
1376000	1378000	Eight hours if you if you're dedicated but
1378000	1380000	I'll drag it out and enjoy it
1380000	1382000	As long as I can so
1382000	1384000	But yeah I
1384000	1386000	Recently acquired an Xbox 360
1386000	1388000	So and that's been
1388000	1390000	That's been a lot of fun
1390000	1392000	And I'm quite impressed I also got a
1392000	1394000	A Samsung
1394000	1396000	Phone with windows on
1396000	1398000	It and I noticed it has the Xbox Live
1398000	1400000	Application
1400000	1402000	I have yet to go through the catalog
1402000	1404000	And see what games are available to download
1404000	1406000	I think I saw Tetris as one of them
1406000	1408000	That's been a big thing they're pushing lately is that the
1408000	1410000	Whole achievements from your phone and all that
1410000	1412000	Pretty good
1412000	1414000	You know what's kind of cool and I kind of
1414000	1416000	Off subject here real quick but we were talking about
1416000	1418000	Oh I was talking about my phone
1418000	1420000	One thing I like and this is something
1420000	1422000	That I wish that they would do with like
1422000	1424000	Steam and stuff is the Android
1424000	1426000	Marketplace say you buy an
1426000	1428000	App or something like from them and it either
1428000	1430000	Sucks or it doesn't work
1430000	1432000	You can get your money back
1432000	1434000	And uninstall
1434000	1436000	Nice yes I mean
1436000	1438000	That's awesome
1438000	1440000	They should really have that
1440000	1442000	I haven't paid for any apps on this
1442000	1444000	On the windows phone yet the only ones I've got
1444000	1446000	I've downloaded were free so
1446000	1448000	But you know we'll see what happens
1448000	1450000	With that I like it so far
1450000	1452000	But
1452000	1454000	Time will tell the battery doesn't last
1454000	1456000	For anything but I'm told that's normal
1456000	1458000	Yeah with a lot of smart phones
1458000	1460000	They don't always last very long
1460000	1462000	My iPhone lasts forever
1462000	1464000	Well the more you're online the more you do
1464000	1466000	The GPS enabled stuff
1466000	1468000	Of course that's all going to be a battery drain
1468000	1470000	So you just want to make sure you're not running anything in the background
1470000	1472000	We were running the MP3 players
1472000	1474000	From here to Washington and didn't lose
1474000	1476000	And didn't use up the whole battery
1476000	1478000	Surprisingly enough MP3 really doesn't use that much battery
1478000	1480000	And I was
1480000	1482000	Using and Facebooking the entire way too
1482000	1484000	It only uses up a lot of battery
1484000	1486000	If you continuously skip through songs
1486000	1488000	I've noticed if you just let it play
1488000	1490000	Yeah it'll go forever
1490000	1492000	So
1492000	1494000	Well anything else for your gaming week you wish to share with us Gary?
1494000	1496000	Oh just
1496000	1498000	A lot of tabletop D&D
1498000	1500000	Ah that's right
1500000	1502000	You're into the old school types of games
1502000	1504000	Not really old school
1504000	1506000	But I like me some Final Fantasy 2
1506000	1508000	And I've got a hold of Final Fantasy 13
1508000	1510000	And haven't had a chance to start it yet
1510000	1512000	Because I'm still one thing at a time
1512000	1514000	And for the tabletop fans out there
1514000	1516000	Because I know there's always a few
1516000	1518000	There's always a little bit of crossover between the video gaming circles and tabletop gaming circles
1518000	1520000	What are your tabletop games of choice right now?
1520000	1522000	Um
1522000	1524000	I was playing
1524000	1526000	I've been playing D&D since 2000
1526000	1528000	So I'm kind of getting burnt out on fantasy
1528000	1530000	I'm looking at Hero System
1530000	1532000	I'm looking at Mutants and Masterminds
1532000	1534000	From Green Ronin
1534000	1536000	Which just recently released
1536000	1538000	A DC Heroes
1538000	1540000	Roleplaying game based on the Mutants and Masterminds system
1540000	1542000	Last fall
1542000	1544000	And they're going to put out the third edition of Mutants and Masterminds
1544000	1546000	Very very shortly
1546000	1548000	I haven't only gotten to play it once or twice
1548000	1550000	But I'm told by people who have played it
1550000	1552000	It's an awesome system
1552000	1554000	I have a little bit more experience with Hero
1554000	1556000	Which is a lot more complicated
1556000	1558000	Alright
1558000	1560000	Speaking of DC there's a big new game coming out soon
1560000	1562000	The DC Universe Online is out in about
1562000	1564000	One, two weeks
1564000	1566000	From that it looks awesome
1566000	1568000	Yeah I've played the beta on the PC
1568000	1570000	It's good times
1570000	1572000	It's a little bit like if Ninja Turtles was an MMO
1572000	1574000	Because it is a lot of beat-em-up
1574000	1576000	It does come with a month of free play
1576000	1578000	Well that's customary, of course
1578000	1580000	So we'll see
1580000	1582000	I'll have to look into that one
1582000	1584000	Alright
1584000	1586000	Well anyway, my gaming week
1586000	1588000	I want to talk about a few things with my gaming week
1588000	1590000	I'm kind of like Gary
1590000	1592000	I was kicking it old school a little bit
1592000	1594000	I wanted to buy two used games and get one free
1594000	1596000	One of them isn't old
1596000	1598000	I bought Tron Evolution
1598000	1600000	Which is the game that came out
1600000	1602000	To support the new Tron movie, Tron Legacy
1602000	1604000	I bought that on the Playstation 3
1604000	1606000	And I played this at E3 and I was somewhat
1606000	1608000	Encouraged by what I saw
1608000	1610000	With the whole Prince of Persia style fighting
1610000	1612000	And you know
1612000	1614000	I was seeing the light bike races
1614000	1616000	On another screen, although that ended up really being
1616000	1618000	The Wii version
1618000	1620000	So I played the Tron game
1620000	1622000	And it sucks, I hate it
1622000	1624000	I'm really disappointed because
1624000	1626000	Tron deserves a better game than this
1626000	1628000	And I'm sorry to say it
1628000	1630000	It was clearly
1630000	1632000	Clearly rushed to make
1632000	1634000	The movie release
1634000	1636000	And this shit always happens with games based on movies
1636000	1638000	And that's why none of them are ever any good
1638000	1640000	I should say, rarely are they good
1640000	1642000	And unfortunately it just falls in that same bin
1642000	1644000	Where the best part about it was the
1644000	1646000	Daft Punk soundtrack in the beginning
1646000	1648000	It's hard to hear that
1648000	1650000	Because it deserves better
1650000	1652000	And there's so much more they could do with the Tron mythos
1652000	1654000	I will say this, the story
1654000	1656000	Is kind of the coolest part
1656000	1658000	And what I liked is that some of it
1658000	1660000	Would parallel scenes in the movie
1660000	1662000	And without giving it all away
1662000	1664000	Because I don't want to tell you about the whole plot
1664000	1666000	But I will say it's supposed to
1666000	1668000	Explain what happened between the first movie
1668000	1670000	And the new movie
1670000	1672000	And the new movie does some of that flashback as well
1672000	1674000	So there is overlap
1674000	1676000	With the flashback scene which you see in the movie
1676000	1678000	And what you play in the game
1678000	1680000	Honestly, I think I'm just going to go on YouTube
1680000	1682000	And try to find a compilation of all the cut scenes from the game
1682000	1684000	There will be more Tron games
1684000	1686000	It's inevitable
1686000	1688000	I wish they'd be better
1688000	1690000	This is what ruined the game for me
1690000	1692000	What absolutely ruined the game for me
1692000	1694000	Was in one sequence
1694000	1696000	I finally got through the first level
1696000	1698000	And I got to the sequence where you're on light bikes
1698000	1700000	And I was like, fuck yes!
1700000	1702000	I get to do the light bike races
1702000	1704000	Because that was one of the coolest fucking things in the movie
1704000	1706000	I'm doing spirals and up the hills
1706000	1708000	Yeah, you know
1708000	1710000	And I'm doing the light bikes and they control
1710000	1712000	Like, butt
1712000	1714000	And I crashed my light cycle
1714000	1716000	I shit you not, like seven times
1716000	1718000	And the whole acceleration, deceleration
1718000	1720000	Doesn't really flow
1720000	1722000	And there's this part where you are supposed to do this big jump
1722000	1724000	But if you haven't accelerated enough
1724000	1726000	You don't make the jump
1726000	1728000	I'm literally sitting there going
1728000	1730000	Did anybody play this game
1730000	1732000	To see if it was fun
1732000	1734000	Because it's not fun
1734000	1736000	And that is so frustrating
1736000	1738000	Because it's Tron
1738000	1740000	It's fucking Tron
1740000	1742000	And it deserves to be so much better
1742000	1744000	I was so mad
1744000	1746000	I will tell you this
1746000	1748000	Do not, do not spend $60 on this game
1748000	1750000	Do spend 99 cents on the iPhone game
1750000	1752000	That's out there because it's a better experience
1752000	1754000	Dude, I have that, it's great
1754000	1756000	That was the other thing that I was trying to remember when I played
1756000	1758000	That game is fun
1758000	1760000	But you did see the movie, right?
1760000	1762000	I fucking love the movie
1762000	1764000	Well you know that they're doing it twice
1764000	1766000	They're doing like a Clone Wars thing with it
1766000	1768000	Where they're going to have an animated series
1768000	1770000	That's going to be between the first and second movies
1770000	1772000	Yeah, that sounds interesting
1772000	1774000	You should totally read the comics by the way
1774000	1776000	The Tron, the betrayal
1776000	1778000	They're really good
1778000	1780000	I wonder if there's any overlap with that in the game as well
1780000	1782000	But let me tell you, here's some of my problems with the game you guys
1782000	1784000	Because you know, I'm sitting here when it stinks
1784000	1786000	The thing is that
1786000	1788000	A lot of the combat feels like really repetitive
1788000	1790000	And there's some frame rate issues
1790000	1792000	When like, you know, you're throwing the disc
1792000	1794000	It just kind of seems to like
1794000	1796000	Bounce all over the screen in random frames
1796000	1798000	The multiplayer
1798000	1800000	Like, what would you think multiplayer would be in Tron?
1800000	1802000	What would you think would be the first thing
1802000	1804000	You're going to go into in a multiplayer in Tron?
1804000	1806000	Anybody?
1806000	1808000	Don't you think? No
1808000	1810000	Nope, it's a battle arena
1810000	1812000	It's not the disc thing, it's just 20 people
1812000	1814000	In a big clusterfuck arena
1814000	1816000	All de-rezzing each other
1816000	1818000	There were no light cycles up front
1818000	1820000	Not that I could find easily
1820000	1822000	I could have sworn I read it's like in there
1822000	1824000	But I was like cycling, I don't know if it's something you have to buy
1824000	1826000	Later on or what
1826000	1828000	But I was cycling through the stuff
1828000	1830000	I didn't find that mode to play
1830000	1832000	So either I'm a complete moron or the game was not well designed
1832000	1834000	Because I could not find it
1834000	1836000	Because I'm thinking, if you're trying to sell a game to Tron fans
1836000	1838000	You would put that light cycle, the tanks
1838000	1840000	All that shit would be front and center
1840000	1842000	You know what I mean? And it's not
1842000	1844000	I went into this ultra lame
1844000	1846000	20 people all throwing discs at each other
1846000	1848000	Or the light jets
1848000	1850000	That would have been cool
1850000	1852000	Or the little mosquito looking guys in the movie
1852000	1854000	It was awesome
1854000	1856000	Wyland in our chatroom says
1856000	1858000	Play a real Tron game, play 2.0
1858000	1860000	You know what? I've heard a lot of good things
1860000	1862000	About that game and I probably should
1862000	1864000	You're probably right
1864000	1866000	I was going to ask you about that
1866000	1868000	Were there any other Tron games that came out before the movie?
1868000	1870000	Besides 2.0?
1870000	1872000	Just Tron 2.0
1872000	1874000	That I know of
1874000	1876000	And that's not counting any fan stuff
1876000	1878000	Because the Tron sequel has been in development
1878000	1880000	For quite some time
1880000	1882000	From what I understand
1882000	1884000	So there's been an absence of Tron things
1884000	1886000	I mean not counting
1886000	1888000	Xbox Live Marketplace
1888000	1890000	Had rehashes of the Tron
1890000	1892000	I don't think you can get them anymore
1892000	1894000	Because of license issues
1894000	1896000	If you don't count that
1896000	1898000	This is where it gets awesome
1898000	1900000	Tron deadly discs
1900000	1902000	And Wyland just wants to say
1902000	1904000	Yeah 2.0 is far far better
1904000	1906000	Than evolution
1906000	1908000	And Tigerclaw says Sky light cycles are in there
1908000	1910000	I think it's the RB button that puts you in light cycle mode
1910000	1912000	Well I mean I know light cycles
1912000	1914000	Were like in the game but is it multiplayer?
1914000	1916000	Because when I was like circling around the different arenas
1916000	1918000	It was all different types of
1918000	1920000	Melee
1920000	1922000	So whatever I mean
1922000	1924000	Call me an idiot if you want
1924000	1926000	But the fact that I couldn't find that very easy
1926000	1928000	I think speaks for itself
1928000	1930000	Yeah
1930000	1932000	Anyhow
1932000	1934000	Unfortunately if you must
1934000	1936000	Rent Tron for the story
1936000	1938000	Do not do not spend 50 or 60 dollars
1938000	1940000	Just go to the Tron wiki
1940000	1942000	I've already read the whole thing on the Tron wiki
1942000	1944000	Well I mean it's nice to see it
1944000	1946000	Like it's fun to see the movie
1946000	1948000	Rent it
1948000	1950000	It's at most worth a $5 rental
1950000	1952000	And you could probably play through it a weekend
1952000	1954000	Or
1954000	1956000	Most red boxes nowadays do have game rentals
1956000	1958000	As well you can rent it for one day
1958000	1960000	For like two bucks
1960000	1962000	There you go
1962000	1964000	From what you were saying that sounds like about all it's worth
1964000	1966000	So I'm gonna move up the scale
1966000	1968000	In games I played this week
1968000	1970000	So here's the next game I played
1970000	1972000	White Knight Chronicles came out in 08
1972000	1974000	It's like a level 5 game for the Playstation 3
1974000	1976000	What was it? Final Fantasy 11
1976000	1978000	The offline version almost
1978000	1980000	Well here's the thing
1980000	1982000	I'm not sure what the fuck this game is
1982000	1984000	Like and that's
1984000	1986000	The weird thing about it
1986000	1988000	Like I kind of feel like White Knight Chronicles
1988000	1990000	Is one of those games where
1990000	1992000	It has a bit of an identity crisis
1992000	1994000	Where they try to do so much with it
1994000	1996000	That they have a lot in the game
1996000	1998000	But it doesn't do any of it exceedingly well
1998000	2000000	And it's not that I dislike the game
2000000	2002000	It's been interesting to me enough
2002000	2004000	Where I've sank like 4 hours in it so far
2004000	2006000	But
2006000	2008000	I don't know
2008000	2010000	Let me kind of set the stage for you
2010000	2012000	It's kind of your typical like
2012000	2014000	You've been kidnapped and you gotta go find her
2014000	2016000	Type of thing
2016000	2018000	You create this character in the beginning of the game
2018000	2020000	And your character does nothing in the story
2020000	2022000	Your character literally stands there
2022000	2024000	Next to the main character
2024000	2026000	While everything is playing out
2026000	2028000	Which is really weird right?
2028000	2030000	So ok whatever
2030000	2032000	The main character and his little lackey
2032000	2034000	You go off on the adventures
2034000	2036000	And you know you're killing things
2036000	2038000	And the battle system is the closest thing I could compare it to
2038000	2040000	Is like Final Fantasy 12
2040000	2042000	Because you can kind of do like live attacks
2042000	2044000	And things and the coolest part was that you can create
2044000	2046000	Combos based on your class
2046000	2048000	And you can kind of like string these
2048000	2050000	Combos together that you've created
2050000	2052000	And so it's kind of cool
2052000	2054000	Like I like that
2054000	2056000	And you go out in the fields and you know
2056000	2058000	Fight some monsters just go from one place to the other
2058000	2060000	And all the monsters you see on the map
2060000	2062000	You start to get some frame rate issues
2062000	2064000	In some areas which are on the Playstation 3
2064000	2066000	Which is supposed to be this uber piece of technology
2066000	2068000	Is a little bit
2068000	2070000	But whatever you know you kind of look past that
2070000	2072000	And go forward
2072000	2074000	And then
2074000	2076000	After about a couple hours into the story it says
2076000	2078000	By the way there's this whole GeoNet thing
2078000	2080000	You can hook up online
2080000	2082000	And play with other people and get quests
2082000	2084000	And do this stuff together
2084000	2086000	And so I'm like oh maybe that's why your character
2086000	2088000	Has been a lackey this whole time
2088000	2090000	Because that's like really going to be your online character
2090000	2092000	Even though they had nothing to do with the single player mode
2092000	2094000	This character is going to be like
2094000	2096000	Your little online person
2096000	2098000	And I don't know
2098000	2100000	And then the game starts to feel like
2100000	2102000	Now I'm playing Phantasy Star Universe
2102000	2104000	There's all these quests
2104000	2106000	That you can kind of do and there's recommended levels
2106000	2108000	And you go out in the field
2108000	2110000	And do your goal like it really kind of felt like
2110000	2112000	Phantasy Star Universe
2112000	2114000	Where you play the single player for a little while
2114000	2116000	And then all of a sudden it's like oh hey it's a multiplayer game too
2116000	2118000	So it's really weird
2118000	2120000	I don't know how else to explain it
2120000	2122000	And sometimes the camera
2122000	2124000	Can kind of bug and sometimes
2124000	2126000	You know the battle system
2126000	2128000	Starts to feel a little bit like okay
2128000	2130000	Like could I gain my little powers
2130000	2132000	A little faster so I could do the cool stuff
2132000	2134000	More often because right now this feels very slow moving
2134000	2136000	So yeah White Knight Chronicles
2136000	2138000	A bit of an identity crisis
2138000	2140000	I didn't hate it
2140000	2142000	I don't love it
2142000	2144000	I like it but I have a really difficult time
2144000	2146000	Explaining to anybody
2146000	2148000	What the game is
2148000	2150000	So your rating in a nutshell is just what meh?
2150000	2152000	I think if you like
2152000	2154000	Japanese RPG type of games
2154000	2156000	And you like the more actiony
2156000	2158000	Based ones like you like Phantasy Star
2158000	2160000	Online
2160000	2162000	It's not press X to swing your sword
2162000	2164000	It's a little more active time battle than that
2164000	2166000	But if you kind of like
2166000	2168000	That sort of idea then I think you'd like it
2168000	2170000	And if you like your grind fest
2170000	2172000	I think it would be permissible
2172000	2174000	And especially now that you can find it most places
2174000	2176000	Like 30, 35 bucks
2176000	2178000	That's a fair price to pay
2178000	2180000	Considering it has a pretty robust online mode
2180000	2182000	It's a fee for
2182000	2184000	So I'll give it that
2184000	2186000	And I guess there's a sequel that came out in Japan
2186000	2188000	But I don't think it's coming out here
2188000	2190000	Because unfortunately I do not believe the game did too well
2190000	2192000	So there you go
2192000	2194000	Yeah so that was the
2194000	2196000	That was the weird thing
2196000	2198000	Then I played
2198000	2200000	Fallout 3
2200000	2202000	I was partying like it was 2008
2202000	2204000	But I finally got a hold of this game
2204000	2206000	On the used game sale
2206000	2208000	And yeah I think the people describing it
2208000	2210000	With guns, really good
2210000	2212000	Great story though
2212000	2214000	I was totally into it in the beginning
2214000	2216000	I think they do a great job kind of setting the stage
2216000	2218000	As you're doing that whole like baby
2218000	2220000	To child to adult
2220000	2222000	And all that
2222000	2224000	I don't want to spoil anything even though the game is like years old now
2224000	2226000	But you know it's kind of like
2226000	2228000	How you get to where you are in the story
2228000	2230000	And why you're in a nuclear wasteland
2230000	2232000	And all this stuff
2232000	2234000	And yeah the only unfortunate thing about it
2234000	2236000	Is that if you don't save often
2236000	2238000	The NPC you might have wanted to do a quest for
2238000	2240000	Will end up dead and now you can't do that quest
2240000	2242000	So uh
2242000	2244000	Save now, save often
2244000	2246000	That's really the only terrible thing I can think about it
2246000	2248000	Otherwise I gotta say
2248000	2250000	Another reason why I really like this game
2250000	2252000	Is that it's not just that it's like first person shooter
2252000	2254000	But you can use some of like your little power
2254000	2256000	By hitting the right bumper
2256000	2258000	To go into like this like
2258000	2260000	Focus attack mode
2260000	2262000	Where if I suck at first person shooters
2262000	2264000	At least if I'm like kind of like stealthy enough
2264000	2266000	At second person points
2266000	2268000	I can still shoot someone in the head with a very accurate shot
2268000	2270000	Because it basically stops the game
2270000	2272000	And you can focus on a part of the body
2272000	2274000	And it tells you the percentage
2274000	2276000	Yeah a little bit
2276000	2278000	Because it tells you like the percentage of success
2278000	2280000	So I thought that was kind of neat
2280000	2282000	So uh yeah
2282000	2284000	I like Fallout and it's a beautiful game
2284000	2286000	And there's so much to it
2286000	2288000	And if you have the game of the year edition
2288000	2290000	You just have quests upon quests upon quests
2290000	2292000	So uh yeah
2292000	2294000	My Fallout 3
2294000	2296000	Um let's see
2296000	2298000	Something else I want to talk about
2298000	2300000	I've had 11 days in a row off of work
2300000	2302000	Because at my work we take the entire time
2302000	2304000	Between Christmas and New Years off
2304000	2306000	It's like a PTO thing I won't get into details
2306000	2308000	That's what we do
2308000	2310000	So I've had 11 days to kind of you know play some games
2310000	2312000	And so forth
2312000	2314000	One day I decided you know what
2314000	2316000	I'm gonna watch The Tester season 2
2316000	2318000	I'm gonna just download every single episode
2318000	2320000	I'm gonna watch the whole damn thing
2320000	2322000	Yeah sure me
2322000	2324000	Has sure me's bowels been voided
2324000	2326000	Okay sure me's asleep so hopefully she won't hear me
2326000	2328000	Talking about this
2328000	2330000	I gotta admit something you guys
2330000	2332000	It was actually a pretty good show
2332000	2334000	Like it was better than the first season
2334000	2336000	What I watched of it
2336000	2338000	I think the show
2338000	2340000	Now here's the show if you haven't heard of it
2340000	2342000	You can only download the show
2342000	2344000	It's only available on PlayStation Network
2344000	2346000	And it's a show about people that are
2346000	2348000	Imagine it's The Apprentice
2348000	2350000	The Donald Trump Show you're fired
2350000	2352000	But it's with video games and the ultimate job is to become
2352000	2354000	The PlayStation Tester
2354000	2356000	Which is why this show is getting a lot of shit
2356000	2358000	Because what a glamorous job game testing is
2358000	2360000	Right?
2360000	2362000	But what I like about the show
2362000	2364000	What I ended up ultimately liking about it
2364000	2366000	Was that you know
2366000	2368000	It didn't really hide the fact
2368000	2370000	That none of these people
2370000	2372000	Really had the goal of being a PlayStation Tester
2372000	2374000	A lot of them said
2374000	2376000	Fully self aware
2376000	2378000	I want this job to get my foot in the door
2378000	2380000	So I can work with these people
2380000	2382000	To work my way up
2382000	2384000	And like this one girl
2384000	2386000	She even says in one episode
2386000	2388000	You know what? I don't even own a PlayStation 3
2388000	2390000	I want to make games for children
2390000	2392000	And you might kind of look at that and go
2392000	2394000	What? You don't even own a PlayStation 3? What the hell are you doing on this show?
2394000	2396000	But I kind of looked at that going
2396000	2398000	That's really kind of honest of Sony to have in there
2398000	2400000	Because if you think everybody that's working
2400000	2402000	In the video game industry right now
2402000	2404000	Grew up on video games
2404000	2406000	And I had a pickup call coming
2406000	2408000	And so I thought it was a very kind of like honest response
2408000	2410000	And another guy had said
2410000	2412000	You know what? I want to do this so I can get into PR
2412000	2414000	And yeah
2414000	2416000	So it seemed like everybody that was kind of on the show
2416000	2418000	Like actually really wanted to be there
2418000	2420000	And I have to admit
2420000	2422000	I can't remember the last time I saw a reality show
2422000	2424000	Where by the time it was down to the last episode
2424000	2426000	The final three people
2426000	2428000	Like I would have been happy with any single one of them winning
2428000	2430000	Ultimately the person that won
2430000	2432000	I thought was a
2432000	2434000	Person that was really going to use
2434000	2436000	Their potential and so forth
2436000	2438000	But I would have been happy if Sony really
2438000	2440000	Ended up hiring any of them
2440000	2442000	Because I thought they kind of told a good story
2442000	2444000	So when I say like
2444000	2446000	Oh my gosh you should drop everything you're doing and watch this show
2446000	2448000	No
2448000	2450000	I mean like really I should have been trying to catch up on
2450000	2452000	True Blood or some other show
2452000	2454000	I don't know why I was watching this
2454000	2456000	But if you're surfing around the channels
2456000	2458000	And you're watching reruns of Cops on G4
2458000	2460000	Or you're watching some of this other garbage that's on TV
2460000	2462000	Like honestly the tester
2462000	2464000	It's not that bad
2464000	2466000	You know it's not like
2466000	2468000	They are
2468000	2470000	It's interesting because
2470000	2472000	You're going to look at some of the like types of challenges
2472000	2474000	They do and so forth and like you're like
2474000	2476000	What does this have to do with game testing
2476000	2478000	Does it have anything to do with game testing
2478000	2480000	But it's TV
2480000	2482000	Look at The Apprentice
2482000	2484000	What does a lot of the crap they do on that show have to do with
2484000	2486000	Actually running a company
2486000	2488000	Not a lot but usually there's that one little
2488000	2490000	Tip in it
2490000	2492000	That is kind of the focus of the episode
2492000	2494000	And that's the same thing I mean this show is a complete rip off
2494000	2496000	Of The Apprentice in many ways
2496000	2498000	So yeah I
2498000	2500000	Really didn't hate it
2500000	2502000	In fact I kind of liked it
2502000	2504000	And I think I'll watch next season
2504000	2506000	Isn't that weird
2506000	2508000	Like we're supposed to hate this show right
2508000	2510000	I'm not smelling any gas from Shermy
2510000	2512000	And to me the second season
2512000	2514000	What the second season did better than the first season
2514000	2516000	Is I really felt like the people
2516000	2518000	That were just like
2518000	2520000	Didn't even want to be there or were just cast
2520000	2522000	Were like the very first person
2522000	2524000	That was off that show
2524000	2526000	I was like if this person laughs in the show
2526000	2528000	I'm gonna just swallow my own tongue
2528000	2530000	Or something it's just terrible
2530000	2532000	But the very first person they kicked off was the right person
2532000	2534000	It was somebody who didn't even need to be there
2534000	2536000	They did have someone that was on
2536000	2538000	That was kind of more of a drama causer than anything else
2538000	2540000	And not to really like spoil
2540000	2542000	What happens or anything
2542000	2544000	But ultimately like when his
2544000	2546000	Desserts comes up you kind of go
2546000	2548000	Oh yeah like if you're like ah
2548000	2550000	So I don't know if that was like a TV thing or what
2550000	2552000	But there you go
2552000	2554000	So looking at our chat
2554000	2556000	Room chat at chat.orangelaunge
2556000	2558000	Radio.com Bochi Kawa in our chat room
2558000	2560000	Says oh tester I thought that it was interesting
2560000	2562000	This run that jerk must have been a plant
2562000	2564000	I really don't think anyone would go that far
2564000	2566000	To be an asshole and would get anywhere near
2566000	2568000	Thinking he wants a job I think you're
2568000	2570000	Right I think he was one of those people that was cast
2570000	2572000	For drama I mean maybe he did want the job
2572000	2574000	But not as bad as
2574000	2576000	The people that ultimately make it to the
2576000	2578000	Final episode and that do end up
2578000	2580000	Ultimately getting the job so
2580000	2582000	Yeah there you go
2582000	2584000	Not as terrible as I would have thought I know I was
2584000	2586000	Surprised maybe you would be too who knows
2586000	2588000	So that's it that's it for my gaming week
2588000	2590000	Let's quickly do some housekeeping
2590000	2592000	You can
2592000	2594000	Join us on twitter at twitter.com
2594000	2596000	Slash o l r we'll be taking some tweets
2596000	2598000	Later on in the show of course and
2598000	2600000	We will be of course
2600000	2602000	Looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
2602000	2604000	And if you don't already have us
2604000	2606000	On facebook please consider adding us
2606000	2608000	Facebook.com slash orangeloungeradio
2608000	2610000	And with that we'll get into some
2610000	2612000	Gaming news tonight and Loki as always
2612000	2614000	Will start us off
2614000	2616000	Ah yes and this is kind of interesting
2616000	2618000	You know the Playstation
2618000	2620000	3 hacking news
2620000	2622000	It's kind of been going back and forth as far
2622000	2624000	Okay we found a crack and oh hey
2624000	2626000	We patched a crack and
2626000	2628000	So on and so forth but this
2628000	2630000	I don't know if they can be able to recover from
2630000	2632000	During the
2632000	2634000	Kind of hacker conference
2634000	2636000	Going on right now the chaos communications
2636000	2638000	Conference 27C3
2638000	2640000	Apparently the
2640000	2642000	Hackers responsible for the Wii's homebrew channel
2642000	2644000	Who I guess is the group called
2644000	2646000	Failoverflow gave a presentation
2646000	2648000	Which they've said they
2648000	2650000	Figured out the private key
2650000	2652000	Sony uses to authorize code
2652000	2654000	To run on retail PS3 systems
2654000	2656000	What that means is that
2656000	2658000	Hackers would have almost full control
2658000	2660000	Of the PS3 system without
2660000	2662000	The use of a USB device
2662000	2664000	Basically
2664000	2666000	It means they'd be able to sign their own code
2666000	2668000	And you'd be able to
2668000	2670000	Do a lot
2670000	2672000	Of things on there including you know
2672000	2674000	Their whole big thing is to run
2674000	2676000	Linux on PS3's whatever the
2676000	2678000	Firmware version is
2678000	2680000	Of course they're not really interested in
2680000	2682000	Piracy with this obviously people
2682000	2684000	Could adapt it to do that
2684000	2686000	But they're really kind of concerned
2686000	2688000	With just the applications of it and
2688000	2690000	Um
2690000	2692000	Some of the things that was kind of neat
2692000	2694000	About it is that they
2694000	2696000	Literally have almost access to all
2696000	2698000	The like cores and everything using this
2698000	2700000	Um
2700000	2702000	It's just kind of neat
2702000	2704000	Who saw this punchline coming a mile away
2704000	2706000	When the PlayStation 3 first did away with Linux
2706000	2708000	And see this is actually hard coded into
2708000	2710000	Each console
2710000	2712000	There's no way to patch this
2712000	2714000	They can't
2714000	2716000	Wow
2716000	2718000	I mean basically what they can do is
2718000	2720000	They create keys or whatever
2720000	2722000	These USB devices have keys on them
2722000	2724000	Assigned to them and what they've done
2724000	2726000	Like to prevent those
2726000	2728000	Jailbreak devices from working
2728000	2730000	Is they add blacklists for different keys
2730000	2732000	Well
2732000	2734000	The master key you can create your own keys
2734000	2736000	From it so
2736000	2738000	They block one you can just create another one
2738000	2740000	You know it's just impossible to
2740000	2742000	Stop it
2742000	2744000	So what happens now? Piracy runs rampant
2744000	2746000	Or what? Not necessarily I mean
2746000	2748000	Their whole big thing is they don't want to
2748000	2750000	They're not aiming towards piracy they just want to
2750000	2752000	Bring like homebrew
2752000	2754000	To the PS3
2754000	2756000	Linux is really what they're looking to
2756000	2758000	Do
2758000	2760000	Let's bring Linux back I guess
2760000	2762000	But don't you think this would have also been a conclusion
2762000	2764000	Anyway even if Sony hadn't done away with Linux
2764000	2766000	Do you think that maybe they were working on this
2766000	2768000	Anyway
2768000	2770000	I mean I guess
2770000	2772000	What do we know we're not in this little organization
2772000	2774000	Or whatever but
2774000	2776000	It's just interesting to me it's really interesting that
2776000	2778000	Sony kind of pulls the plug on the whole
2778000	2780000	Linux thing because they were worried about
2780000	2782000	People exploiting it for piracy really
2782000	2784000	At the end of the day and now it's like
2784000	2786000	Well we're just going to shove Linux
2786000	2788000	In this thing whether you like it or not
2788000	2790000	And if they can install Linux on a freaking toaster
2790000	2792000	They can install Linux on a
2792000	2794000	Hacker proof PS3
2794000	2796000	This is probably worse than the whole
2796000	2798000	Exploit through
2798000	2800000	Linux to begin with
2800000	2802000	Because a lot of people may not have had Linux
2802000	2804000	On their system or weren't even interested
2804000	2806000	In that but the fact that they
2806000	2808000	Took it away and people don't like
2808000	2810000	When things are taken away especially when they
2810000	2812000	Paid for them whether it's an advertised
2812000	2814000	Feature or not I don't care
2814000	2816000	Now to be fair
2816000	2818000	Just devil's advocate you don't have
2818000	2820000	To patch your PS3 to remove
2820000	2822000	The Linux you just won't be able to play
2822000	2824000	Any games in the past
2824000	2826000	That's removed from your system
2826000	2828000	That's basically it we can either
2828000	2830000	Say oh well you know
2830000	2832000	You could lose Linux and you get column A
2832000	2834000	Games made in 2010
2834000	2836000	Or you get column B Linux
2836000	2838000	You can't have both
2838000	2840000	So that's kind of lame
2840000	2842000	But it's going to be interesting
2842000	2844000	To see where this goes from here because
2844000	2846000	That's bad
2846000	2848000	SSJ100Matt in our chat room says
2848000	2850000	I don't know I still think people are going to
2850000	2852000	Use it to pirate games well of course they are
2852000	2854000	Of course there are people out there
2854000	2856000	That are going to do that and
2856000	2858000	I don't doubt that they're
2858000	2860000	Going to find ways to do that but
2860000	2862000	It's just that the
2862000	2864000	Aim of this group wasn't to
2864000	2866000	Just you know
2866000	2868000	Create some sort of way to pirate games
2868000	2870000	They're not interested in that
2870000	2872000	But other people are
2872000	2874000	Interested in that I'm really curious
2874000	2876000	To see what Sony's kind of
2876000	2878000	Response ends up being to this because you know
2878000	2880000	A lot of them are probably coming back from holiday
2880000	2882000	Tomorrow you know while I'm sure there's some
2882000	2884000	People working for Sony 365
2884000	2886000	Days a year there's probably a lot of people
2886000	2888000	Coming back tomorrow and it's going to be interesting to see what
2888000	2890000	Their kind of response is if they do try to
2890000	2892000	Patch it I know you say it's unpatchable
2892000	2894000	They try to do something I mean
2894000	2896000	They've got it they kind of owe it to their
2896000	2898000	Basically I mean they've got a lot
2898000	2900000	Of things even just after
2900000	2902000	This conference you know they have things being released
2902000	2904000	That group has already released
2904000	2906000	The development tools for
2906000	2908000	The stuff that they have so now they have
2908000	2910000	Different you know
2910000	2912000	Like
2912000	2914000	Early code and stuff to
2914000	2916000	Code to pack and unpack
2916000	2918000	Pup and package files to
2918000	2920000	Make and read
2920000	2922000	Selfs and
2922000	2924000	Other developer related stuff
2924000	2926000	So you know
2926000	2928000	Look forward to possibly
2928000	2930000	Custom firmwares what not
2930000	2932000	And they've already released the root key so
2932000	2934000	I mean
2934000	2936000	I don't know there's not much
2936000	2938000	More you can really do there it's just
2938000	2940000	Yeah
2940000	2942000	It's going to be tough there's
2942000	2944000	Not really any way that they're going to be able to get around this
2944000	2946000	Wow
2946000	2948000	Because if you think about it you can't change
2948000	2950000	The master key if you do
2950000	2952000	That then like
2952000	2954000	You know some of the consoles aren't going to
2954000	2956000	Work you just can't it's part of
2956000	2958000	The hardware
2958000	2960000	Alright well something else to look forward to
2960000	2962000	Hardware wise
2962000	2964000	Hardware wise in 2011
2964000	2966000	Is the psp2
2966000	2968000	Of course we've heard rumors and rumors about
2968000	2970000	It but more and more
2970000	2972000	Seems to come out every week and this has to do with a
2972000	2974000	New York Times interview that
2974000	2976000	Khaz Harai he's the of course Sony computer
2976000	2978000	Entertainment head talking
2978000	2980000	A little bit about the psp2 but not
2980000	2982000	Directly a lot of people are kind of inferring
2982000	2984000	Things about the psp2 because
2984000	2986000	Keep in mind Sony has not confirmed a psp2
2986000	2988000	It's just one of those duh
2988000	2990000	Of course they're working on a new hand held system
2990000	2992000	And we don't know if it's a phone
2992000	2994000	We don't know if it's a psp2
2994000	2996000	We don't know if it's both or one of each
2996000	2998000	We don't know that stuff yet but we do know
2998000	3000000	What Khaz Harai said to the New York Times and that was
3000000	3002000	Quote depending on the game there are ones
3002000	3004000	Which you can play perfectly well with a
3004000	3006000	Touch panel but you can definitely play
3006000	3008000	Immersive games better without physical buttons
3008000	3010000	And pads I think there could be games
3010000	3012000	Where you're able to use both in combination
3012000	3014000	Oh so suddenly he's kind of
3014000	3016000	Endorsing a little bit about touch things right
3016000	3018000	Hmm this must mean
3018000	3020000	That some of those rumors about the touch panels are true
3020000	3022000	Quote we don't want gamers to be asking
3022000	3024000	What's the difference between
3024000	3026000	A Playstation phone or a phone
3026000	3028000	And a psp we have to come up
3028000	3030000	With a message that users will understand
3030000	3032000	It would have to be a product that keeps
3032000	3034000	The Playstation's strengths intact
3034000	3036000	Again sort of
3036000	3038000	You know kind of
3038000	3040000	Not outright saying there's a Playstation
3040000	3042000	Phone but saying you know we're trying
3042000	3044000	To kind of you know
3044000	3046000	You have to do it right and of course
3046000	3048000	We're doing it right
3048000	3050000	Come on
3050000	3052000	Please
3052000	3054000	Well Consumer Electronics Show is this weekend if I'm not mistaken
3054000	3056000	Or this week
3056000	3058000	So you might see it there but
3058000	3060000	I mean if it's
3060000	3062000	I would say this if the phone
3062000	3064000	And the psp2 are
3064000	3066000	Separate I would say you'll see the phone
3066000	3068000	As CES you might see it as soon as CES
3068000	3070000	Possibly Game Developers Conference
3070000	3072000	Psp2 however
3072000	3074000	E3 I mean
3074000	3076000	Maybe Game Developers Conference but again
3076000	3078000	Game Developers Conference is not supposed to be the media event
3078000	3080000	That's E3
3080000	3082000	But Sony kind of seems
3082000	3084000	To use Game Developers Conference
3084000	3086000	Anyway to make big announcements
3086000	3088000	They talked about the move
3088000	3090000	They unveiled Playstation Home
3090000	3092000	It wouldn't be unheard of for them to drop
3092000	3094000	A little bombshell
3094000	3096000	Although I think the psp2 would just be so big of a bombshell
3096000	3098000	I think Game Developers
3098000	3100000	Conference is too early for it
3100000	3102000	Unless they just want to come out and say
3102000	3104000	Okay fine you figured it out
3104000	3106000	So here developers get to work
3106000	3108000	We'll see
3108000	3110000	Anyhow moving on with some other news
3110000	3112000	Sadness
3112000	3114000	Very very much sadness
3114000	3116000	About the psp2 I know
3116000	3118000	Arcade Infinity
3118000	3120000	Uh oh
3120000	3122000	It's gone
3122000	3124000	The inevitable has happened
3124000	3126000	It's closing on January 15th so we need to go
3126000	3128000	Take a trip to LA like now
3128000	3130000	Like tomorrow? Yeah
3130000	3132000	Good luck right
3132000	3134000	Basically Arcade Infinity
3134000	3136000	Was the big place that
3136000	3138000	Got a lot of RB money in the US
3138000	3140000	Not just that
3140000	3142000	But a lot of just import games in general
3142000	3144000	I played an Umjamilami
3144000	3146000	Arcade machine at Arcade Infinity
3146000	3148000	And the tambourine version of
3148000	3150000	Samba de Amigo
3150000	3152000	Which by the way is the gayest video game I've ever played in my life
3152000	3154000	Was that tambourine
3154000	3156000	To whatever
3156000	3158000	You shake around a tambourine like you're Stevie Nicks
3158000	3160000	It's crazy
3160000	3162000	Except without the big hobo
3162000	3164000	Stuff
3164000	3166000	Anyway I'm sorry I meant boho stuff
3166000	3168000	But yeah these are the places
3168000	3170000	That brought us Blaze Blue
3170000	3172000	And DJ Max Technica
3172000	3174000	And the Gundam game
3174000	3176000	Remember that awesome Gundam game?
3176000	3178000	And remember one day
3178000	3180000	That we were there
3180000	3182000	We sat and played like what 10 games of
3182000	3184000	Shock Troopers
3184000	3186000	Just because it was on free play
3186000	3188000	That was pretty fun
3188000	3190000	I've never played Typing of the Dead
3190000	3192000	And we're like
3192000	3194000	Oh my god it's in Japanese
3194000	3196000	We could get as far as the boss
3196000	3198000	That would ask you questions and you'd have to answer them
3198000	3200000	And then it would be like shit I don't know Japanese
3200000	3202000	I can't do it
3202000	3204000	But I mean man
3204000	3206000	I just have so many good memories
3206000	3208000	Of that place but now
3208000	3210000	It's gonna be
3210000	3212000	Closing
3212000	3214000	It's going away
3214000	3216000	I gotta be honest the last time I was there
3216000	3218000	I didn't have quite the wonder
3218000	3220000	That it had when I was there back in its
3220000	3222000	Hay day but I think that's
3222000	3224000	Sadly arcades in general
3224000	3226000	I really hate to say it but
3226000	3228000	Man the online stuff is really
3228000	3230000	It's really
3230000	3232000	Taking its toll I mean it's kind of obvious
3232000	3234000	Well you know the other thing that they were doing
3234000	3236000	There was
3236000	3238000	Selling import skylines
3238000	3240000	Like bringing
3240000	3242000	In cars from Japan
3242000	3244000	And trying to make them street legal
3244000	3246000	For sale in the U.S.
3246000	3248000	But yeah apparently Bimani
3248000	3250000	Style folks are having a
3250000	3252000	Gathering there for the last day
3252000	3254000	So
3254000	3256000	Our buddy DJ Tyrant
3256000	3258000	Who once in a while does some stories
3258000	3260000	Foragelongstreet.com he's gonna go and give us
3260000	3262000	A little report so since I can't be there
3262000	3264000	It'll be nice to have somebody there
3264000	3266000	Bring me back a token
3266000	3268000	I probably have a bunch still somewhere
3268000	3270000	I know I've got some somewhere but
3270000	3272000	That's just really sad cause I mean
3272000	3274000	Whenever we would go to LA we would always make it a point
3274000	3276000	That we were gonna go to Arcade Infinity
3276000	3278000	And then we'd go have dinner at that place
3278000	3280000	That you had to walk all the way freaking across
3280000	3282000	A you know football field sized parking lot
3282000	3284000	To go eat at
3284000	3286000	And then we'd go back and play more games and then
3286000	3288000	You know it's just it's sad
3288000	3290000	Yeah Very very sad
3290000	3292000	Well it's just sad in general that
3292000	3294000	Here's another great arcade closing its doors
3294000	3296000	And this is a trend we saw starting
3296000	3298000	Years ago with what Southern Hills Golf
3298000	3300000	Land Folsom Game Room
3300000	3302000	You know all these
3302000	3304000	Arcades just started closing and closing
3304000	3306000	And even the arcades that are still there
3306000	3308000	Which would be like Roseville Golf Land and some of the other
3308000	3310000	Golf lands that are out there
3310000	3312000	Are nothing but ticket redemption machines now
3312000	3314000	You know what I mean?
3314000	3316000	Shermie's trying to get out so she can go poop on the tester
3316000	3318000	Yep I figured as much
3318000	3320000	She's probably trying to get out No she's fine
3320000	3322000	She's sitting underneath your butt She doesn't poop in the corner
3322000	3324000	She's sitting underneath you
3324000	3326000	Shermie is equally sad
3326000	3328000	About the closure of Arcade Infinity
3328000	3330000	It is sad
3330000	3332000	Certainly back in the heyday that was the only place
3332000	3334000	I could play Keyboard Mania
3334000	3336000	Yeah
3336000	3338000	And I just remember playing the crap
3338000	3340000	Out of that Gundam game
3340000	3342000	Well somebody needs to take a 40
3342000	3344000	And pour it out in the parking lot
3344000	3346000	What are they doing to the rest of their candy cabs?
3346000	3348000	Unfortunately I only have good beer
3348000	3350000	So I'm not going to do that
3350000	3352000	Just go to BevMo and get one crappy beer
3352000	3354000	So you can
3354000	3356000	Ice cold, cold 45
3356000	3358000	Cold 45, dump it in the lot
3358000	3360000	Thank you
3360000	3362000	Please and take pictures of it
3362000	3364000	Take pictures of it
3364000	3366000	One for me and one for my homies
3366000	3368000	Rest in peace Arcade Infinity
3368000	3370000	Sorry to see you go
3370000	3372000	I wonder what they're doing with their cabinets
3372000	3374000	You opportunist
3374000	3376000	Probably the same thing that Tilt at the Metron is doing
3376000	3378000	You want to get a BeatMania machine for 300 bucks
3378000	3380000	I should check uh
3380000	3382000	Well I don't have a
3382000	3384000	Speaking of other arcades that have
3384000	3386000	Gone away
3386000	3388000	You get a Marvel vs Capcom for 300 bucks
3388000	3390000	Allen saw that and he said Christmas Rob! Christmas!
3390000	3392000	Christmas!
3392000	3394000	Poor Allen, poor
3394000	3396000	Alright anyway
3396000	3398000	Uh yeah
3398000	3400000	Well Nintendo was warning that you shouldn't have children
3400000	3402000	Under the age of 6
3402000	3404000	Playing the 3DS in 3D mode
3404000	3406000	Apparently it will make them go cross-eyed
3406000	3408000	Well that's not the reason
3408000	3410000	But it may hurt their vision
3410000	3412000	So
3412000	3414000	It's bad
3414000	3416000	So don't play it in 3D mode
3416000	3418000	Unless you want cross-eyed kids
3418000	3420000	Oh come on
3420000	3422000	Surely it can't be
3422000	3424000	That you play
3424000	3426000	This for 5 minutes and you're gonna go cross-eyed
3426000	3428000	You're talking about prolonged
3428000	3430000	Exposure
3430000	3432000	Is what this is
3432000	3434000	Nintendo's probably over-reacting
3434000	3436000	So there isn't a lawsuit
3436000	3438000	When at the end of the day this really comes down to
3438000	3440000	Parents, you really should watch how much
3440000	3442000	Of the games your 6 year old is playing
3442000	3444000	Exactly and that brings up a wonderful point
3444000	3446000	Is that you can use the included
3446000	3448000	Parental controls
3448000	3450000	That allow parents to lock the device
3450000	3452000	In 2D mode
3452000	3454000	So it's the 3DS 2DS
3456000	3458000	That's okay though
3458000	3460000	As much as I think the 3D thing is kinda cool
3460000	3462000	Like there's gonna be times where I don't want
3462000	3464000	The 3D, like I just wanna play
3464000	3466000	A 2D little game and have it at that
3466000	3468000	But what's interesting to me
3468000	3470000	Is that they are releasing movies
3470000	3472000	On the 3DS
3472000	3474000	At least if E3 is any indication
3474000	3476000	I guess we won't really know till the official
3476000	3478000	Press reveal or what have you
3478000	3480000	But they were showing a
3480000	3482000	Trailer for Tangled
3482000	3484000	The Rapunzel movie that's out in theaters
3484000	3486000	By the way it was actually really good
3486000	3488000	They were showing a trailer
3488000	3490000	For that at E3 on the 3DS
3490000	3492000	So they're gonna market
3492000	3494000	3D movies for kids on these things
3494000	3496000	So
3496000	3498000	You know
3498000	3500000	Granted you could say that well Tangled
3500000	3502000	Would also work for a 10-15
3502000	3504000	To an adult really year old
3504000	3506000	Come on
3506000	3508000	To an adult year old?
3508000	3510000	You know what parent isn't gonna want to sit
3510000	3512000	Their 6 year old in the back of the car and have them watch
3512000	3514000	Tangled to shut them up on a road trip
3514000	3516000	In 3D!
3516000	3518000	It'd be like buying an
3518000	3520000	Expensive 3D
3520000	3522000	HD television and going
3522000	3524000	You know what? I'm watching all
3524000	3526000	3D
3526000	3528000	I don't need this 3D
3528000	3530000	I'll pay your high premium price
3530000	3532000	For your TV with fancy technology
3532000	3534000	But I'm not, in fact you know what
3534000	3536000	I'm not even hooking up HDMI to it
3536000	3538000	I'm going straight composite bitch
3538000	3540000	So Nintendo
3540000	3542000	Is paranoid that
3542000	3544000	Some kid somewhere is gonna
3544000	3546000	Go cross eyed because they spent
3546000	3548000	12 hours a day looking at the
3548000	3550000	3DS and so they're putting this disclaimer
3550000	3552000	On it to kind of save their own butt because
3552000	3554000	Parents can't be bothered to watch how much
3554000	3556000	Their kids are playing games. That's what the story
3556000	3558000	Should really say, right?
3558000	3560000	At least that's what I think
3560000	3562000	Enablers!
3562000	3564000	I love this chat room
3564000	3566000	Chatter here, big wang eater
3566000	3568000	Um
3568000	3570000	So that'd be cool if 3DS had a deer hunter
3570000	3572000	In 3D, well you know what?
3572000	3574000	Cabela's comes out each year
3574000	3576000	They've been doing a lot of games on the DS
3576000	3578000	I would not be surprised if you see a 3DS
3578000	3580000	Cabela's game
3580000	3582000	Somewhere somehow some idiot parent
3582000	3584000	Will let their kid play that, their six year old
3584000	3586000	Kid play that in 3D. Big wang eater
3586000	3588000	Thank you big wang eater
3588000	3590000	Alright, 3D porn
3590000	3592000	Well the big wang eater goes on to say
3592000	3594000	3D porn, well you know
3594000	3596000	You will be able to take your own 3D pictures with this
3596000	3598000	You can show the big wang being eaten
3598000	3600000	Can you share the pictures you take
3600000	3602000	Like on the internet or whatever? I think you can
3602000	3604000	Awesome, time to penis
3604000	3606000	5 seconds, 5 seconds
3606000	3608000	Before we have a 3D penis
3608000	3610000	You know what?
3610000	3612000	See, some of us actually
3612000	3614000	Have people that we can
3614000	3616000	Do this in real life with
3616000	3618000	And don't need to watch it in 3D
3618000	3620000	We have what's called real life
3620000	3622000	Ah
3622000	3624000	They've also already been marketing like
3624000	3626000	When I did see that whole Tangled movie
3626000	3628000	Which by the way, I saw lots of
3628000	3630000	Six year olds in that theater wearing 3D glasses
3630000	3632000	And watching the movie, but anyway
3632000	3634000	They were showing a commercial
3634000	3636000	For a 3D camera
3636000	3638000	So you'd like watch the pictures on your 3D TV
3638000	3640000	That you take with the new camera
3640000	3642000	So, and this isn't DS related
3642000	3644000	It's like a new Sony camera or whatever
3644000	3646000	That does 3D pictures
3646000	3648000	Cause everybody has a boner for 3D right now
3648000	3650000	I like what Isam said
3650000	3652000	4D porn sex across time
3652000	3654000	I approve of that
3654000	3656000	Alright
3656000	3658000	That's what you need a TARDIS for
3658000	3660000	Well, moving on to other things
3660000	3662000	Nintendo that aren't necessarily 3D
3662000	3664000	But I bet a lot of people wish this was
3664000	3666000	Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword
3666000	3668000	Hey remember, there's a new Zelda game coming you guys
3668000	3670000	Remember?
3670000	3672000	They were talking about it
3672000	3674000	They were talking about it at E3 and it was delayed from Christmas
3674000	3676000	Rob ignored it
3676000	3678000	As if he has the upward thrust
3678000	3680000	Only in 2D
3680000	3682000	I'm sorry
3682000	3684000	But here's the deal guys, not only has it been delayed past Christmas
3684000	3686000	But now Nintendo is kinda saying
3686000	3688000	Yeah that whole early
3688000	3690000	2011 thing
3690000	3692000	Liars
3692000	3694000	That's not really gonna happen
3694000	3696000	Because of course there is very dense gameplay
3696000	3698000	And you're gonna want to replay this game
3698000	3700000	Dense?
3700000	3702000	That's not a description for gameplay
3702000	3704000	They have quietly
3704000	3706000	Moved this game to a
3706000	3708000	2011 release
3708000	3710000	Could be any time next year
3710000	3712000	We need to save it for
3712000	3714000	The holidays
3714000	3716000	For our Wii HD
3716000	3718000	It's gonna be a game that's slightly uprest
3718000	3720000	Well there you go
3720000	3722000	There's not a lot of
3722000	3724000	Like huge games I can think of that really have me
3724000	3726000	Excited that are coming out on the Wii anytime soon
3726000	3728000	Like it's all about the 3DS at Nintendo right now
3728000	3730000	So unfortunately this news is a little bit sad
3730000	3732000	Well
3732000	3734000	Hey they have innovative games for the Wii
3734000	3736000	Like Mario's Sports Mix
3736000	3738000	It's a sports game compilation
3738000	3740000	There's none of those on the Wii right?
3740000	3742000	That sound you heard in the background
3742000	3744000	That was crickets chirping
3744000	3746000	We have a soundboard for that
3746000	3748000	That was me blinking
3748000	3752000	Tired call on our chatroom talking about 3D by the way
3752000	3756000	It says 3D TVs are way behind in the 3D technology
3756000	3758000	Theaters now are using polarized lenses
3758000	3760000	Which doesn't need to use the shutter glasses technology
3760000	3764000	In other words you don't have to recharge the glasses to watch 3D
3764000	3768000	Exactly and that's what I'm saying they need to fucking do with those damn TVs
3768000	3772000	Cause those glasses are like $5 or free if you steal them from the movie theaters
3772000	3774000	You're not stealing them
3774000	3776000	You're paying the premium for them anyway
3776000	3778000	You're paying the recycler
3778000	3780000	They can go fuck themselves I'm paying for those damn glasses
3780000	3782000	Actually
3782000	3784000	But they're still gonna charge you the full theater price when you bring in
3784000	3786000	Whether or not you bring in your own pair of 3D glasses it seems like
3786000	3788000	Actually I thought it was a great suggestion
3788000	3790000	One of my friends suggested after seeing Tron
3790000	3792000	You know we should keep these glasses
3792000	3794000	And we should like bling them out
3794000	3796000	And like you know bedazzle them
3796000	3798000	And you'll put like pipe cleaner designs on them
3798000	3800000	And all this
3800000	3802000	So that way you know next time they try to hand you your 3D glasses
3802000	3804000	Oh no thanks I brought my own
3804000	3808000	They have designer polarized glasses you can get like pay like hundreds of dollars for
3808000	3810000	Awesome
3810000	3812000	Why?
3812000	3814000	You know what I should actually hold onto those to wear over my glasses
3814000	3816000	For when I go outside in the sun
3816000	3818000	Nice
3818000	3820000	Do those things work
3820000	3822000	The 3D glasses for the theater
3822000	3824000	They don't work with the TVs do they?
3824000	3826000	No
3826000	3828000	That was what we were saying
3828000	3832000	The only 3D technology that I think that's worthwhile is the Disney one
3832000	3836000	Just because it uses the polarized glasses
3836000	3840000	Or Nintendo's new technology which uses nothing at all
3840000	3842000	Exactly
3842000	3844000	They're actually looking to do TVs that way too
3844000	3848000	Which I think would really hurt your eyes
3848000	3852000	But I think that the polarized glasses are a good alternative
3852000	3854000	Because in that way instead of saying
3854000	3856000	Yeah you gotta buy this 3D TV
3856000	3858000	Oh by the way if you want more than two people to watch that
3858000	3860000	You're gonna need to buy another set of $100 glasses
3860000	3862000	Yeah
3862000	3864000	No thank you
3864000	3866000	Alright well
3866000	3868000	So Zelda Skyward Sword
3868000	3870000	2D, 3D, whatever D it's in
3870000	3872000	It's probably not coming out until December
3872000	3874000	What?
3874000	3876000	Upward thrust
3876000	3878000	Moving on
3878000	3882000	Well you know Final Fantasy 13 came out for the Xbox 360 in Japan
3882000	3884000	And guess what?
3884000	3886000	That's how well it did
3886000	3892000	It showed up at 39th in the software charts for Japan
3892000	3894000	Which is really low
3894000	3898000	So yeah they only sold
3898000	3904000	Well I'll put it this way the game that made number 20 sold 22,579 units
3904000	3906000	Yeah
3906000	3908000	That's kind of
3908000	3910000	So it probably sold about 10,000 or whatever
3910000	3912000	Something like that
3912000	3914000	Wasn't that how many 360 owners there are in Japan?
3914000	3916000	Well the number of
3916000	3918000	It's under 1.5 million
3918000	3920000	Users in Japan
3920000	3922000	And keep in mind the PS3
3922000	3924000	Is close to 6 million
3924000	3926000	So
3926000	3928000	Basically
3928000	3930000	There were a lot of
3930000	3934000	Also because of how early Final Fantasy 13 came out in Japan
3934000	3936000	And they thought it was only gonna be for
3936000	3938000	PlayStation 3 so a lot of people bought
3938000	3940000	A PlayStation 3 just to play Final Fantasy 13
3940000	3944000	I was gonna say when I first kind of heard about this story earlier in the week
3944000	3946000	I had gotten into Double Take and said
3946000	3950000	I thought they specifically said they are not doing 360 Final Fantasy 13 in Japan
3950000	3952000	So where the hell did this come from?
3952000	3954000	Well even with this one it had you know
3954000	3956000	A few extra goodies and you know
3956000	3958000	They brought other stuff out and did a price reduction on it
3958000	3960000	And it still wasn't enough
3960000	3964000	So kind of like the typical international editions they usually do in Final Fantasy games right?
3964000	3966000	But see now though
3966000	3970000	Well the whole thing is that typically these international editions have come out on the same console
3970000	3972000	And have had the English content
3972000	3974000	Like for example I've got
3974000	3976000	Final Fantasy X-2 International
3976000	3978000	And the game I can pick
3978000	3980000	Japanese or English language
3980000	3982000	I can choose my subtitles
3982000	3984000	And yeah I'm trying to
3984000	3986000	Watch this comparison to
3986000	3988000	To see you know
3988000	3990000	What the deal is and
3990000	3992000	The Xbox 360
3992000	3994000	One actually kind of looks like
3994000	3996000	Poop in comparison
3996000	3998000	Oh no it doesn't they look the same
3998000	4000000	I think people look way too
4000000	4002000	I think in order to see that level of detail
4002000	4004000	You have to be sitting as close to your TV
4004000	4006000	As you're sitting next to your monitor right now
4006000	4008000	Well yeah but I'm saying
4008000	4010000	You know but also for people who have
4010000	4012000	You know a really good HDTV
4012000	4014000	It's
4014000	4016000	Gonna make a difference like right now
4016000	4018000	The biggest things now keep in mind I also
4018000	4020000	Have an eye for it
4020000	4022000	I'm seeing difference in color quality
4022000	4024000	I'm seeing difference in line quality
4024000	4026000	You know
4026000	4028000	Yeah but how much of that can be blamed on the fact you're watching a streaming
4028000	4030000	And that's why Final Fantasy 13 sucked
4030000	4032000	No Final Fantasy 13 is great
4032000	4034000	It is I think it's a great
4034000	4036000	Game and it's
4036000	4038000	I don't understand all this hatred
4038000	4040000	Well I do understand why people are hating on it
4040000	4042000	But trust me I've played way worse games this past year
4042000	4044000	Final Fantasy 13 isn't even close
4044000	4046000	Well no I'm not saying it's at all bad
4046000	4048000	That would be Final Fantasy 14
4048000	4050000	Yeah seriously no I know you're not
4050000	4052000	I did the same thing with the Saturn and the Playstation
4052000	4054000	Versions of Castlevania Symphony of the Night
4054000	4056000	Because we had the Saturn
4056000	4058000	One and the uh
4058000	4060000	And we listened to the two
4060000	4062000	We watched both of them
4062000	4064000	The Saturn version had better 2D
4064000	4066000	Shitty 3D
4066000	4068000	The Saturn version had better sound quality
4068000	4070000	The Playstation version had better
4070000	4072000	Load times
4072000	4074000	So I'm the kind that does
4074000	4076000	This type of comparison so
4076000	4078000	Going back to the story at hand because I kind of feel like
4078000	4080000	The 360 PS3 debate on Final Fantasy 13
4080000	4082000	Was like 9 months old when the game came out
4082000	4084000	But going back to the story at hand
4084000	4086000	I get the sense people in Japan
4086000	4088000	Didn't buy this game because A
4088000	4090000	They didn't know for the longest time that it was coming out
4090000	4092000	And most people bought it on Playstation 3
4092000	4094000	Thinking it was never coming out on the 360
4094000	4096000	And B, you don't have
4096000	4098000	Close to that same
4098000	4100000	Adoption ratio you have here in the US
4100000	4102000	In Japan you're talking six
4102000	4104000	Playstation 3's for every one Xbox 360
4104000	4106000	That's not even
4106000	4108000	Close to the ratio here
4108000	4110000	Which is not the reverse but it's
4110000	4112000	A lot closer to one to one than that
4112000	4114000	And also though I have to look at it
4114000	4116000	This way too is that we're dealing with
4116000	4118000	Sony, a Japan based company
4118000	4120000	And we're dealing with Microsoft
4120000	4122000	A US based company
4122000	4124000	I think they're gonna know their markets a little bit
4124000	4126000	Better in their native area
4126000	4128000	That's really my point
4128000	4130000	You know
4130000	4132000	For example, the Saturn did
4132000	4134000	So much better in Japan than it did here
4134000	4136000	And a lot of it had to do with marketing
4136000	4138000	A lot of it had to do with audience
4138000	4140000	You know I think that
4140000	4142000	Going with the same thing I think that
4142000	4144000	Microsoft knew how to market to an American audience
4144000	4146000	They didn't know how to market to a Japanese audience
4146000	4148000	And maybe they didn't want the same type of
4148000	4150000	Features that we do here so you start off
4150000	4152000	With a less interested
4152000	4154000	Base and then you bring out a game
4154000	4156000	However long after
4156000	4158000	There's been another version
4158000	4160000	Out that's available to people who
4160000	4162000	Have the system
4162000	4164000	So it's
4164000	4166000	It's basically
4166000	4168000	I don't know why they expected it to do well
4168000	4170000	I was gonna say I was hoping Final Fantasy 13
4170000	4172000	Doesn't suck I just bought it but I haven't started it yet
4172000	4174000	It doesn't suck by the way
4174000	4176000	For the Xbox 360
4176000	4178000	It doesn't suck it's just better on PS3
4178000	4180000	I'll take your word for it then
4180000	4182000	And I don't even think it's
4182000	4184000	Negligible honestly
4184000	4186000	I don't think you would notice a difference
4186000	4188000	I was gonna say what's the difference honestly
4188000	4190000	You have to disc swap on the 360 version
4190000	4192000	You know what
4192000	4194000	We had to do that on the PlayStation 2
4194000	4196000	What kind of TV do you have an HD TV
4196000	4198000	That you play on or do you use the standard?
4198000	4200000	I have a Samsung
4200000	4202000	Is it full 1080
4202000	4204000	Or is it only 720
4204000	4206000	You might notice
4206000	4208000	Like the hair is a little different
4208000	4210000	It's an LED
4210000	4212000	Basically the big things you're gonna notice
4212000	4214000	Is difference in color
4214000	4216000	You won't notice any difference if you never see the
4216000	4218000	PS3 version I'll put it that way
4218000	4220000	But the big difference is that you're dealing with
4220000	4222000	More jaggedies
4222000	4224000	More aliasing on the
4224000	4226000	Xbox 360 version because the graphics processor
4226000	4228000	Is different the game was made for the PS3
4228000	4230000	So you're basically dealing with
4230000	4232000	The whole
4232000	4234000	Port issues
4234000	4236000	You're also dealing with the fact that there is
4236000	4238000	Rampant hardcore pornography in the Xbox
4238000	4240000	360 version
4240000	4242000	While there wasn't in the PS3 version
4242000	4244000	And that may offend some people but for me
4244000	4246000	That was a plus
4246000	4248000	I mean
4248000	4250000	It was much
4250000	4252000	I'd expect that kind of stuff in Mexico but
4252000	4254000	I'm not sure whether that makes me want to play it more or not
4254000	4256000	I don't need to know that about you
4256000	4258000	Anyhow
4258000	4260000	Why don't we travel the world and talk about some release dates
4260000	4262000	Some other games that might do a little bit better
4262000	4264000	Or
4264000	4266000	Not
4266000	4268000	This week is still a little bit light
4268000	4270000	January I mean come on
4270000	4272000	It's not a big ol' release month
4272000	4274000	Some cool stuff though coming out
4274000	4276000	But not so much this week
4276000	4278000	Lost in Shadow though on the Wii is making
4278000	4280000	It's way out so that puzzle game
4280000	4282000	From Hudson Soft it kind of has a little bit of a
4282000	4284000	Shadow Colossus vibe to it
4284000	4286000	That'll be on the Wii
4286000	4288000	And
4288000	4290000	Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the
4290000	4292000	Osborne house
4292000	4294000	That's on Nintendo DS
4294000	4296000	Cool you get to go to the Osborne's house?
4296000	4298000	Uh
4298000	4300000	Yeah
4300000	4302000	Not that Osborne house I'm afraid
4302000	4304000	Uh Emergency
4304000	4306000	2012
4306000	4308000	Um
4308000	4310000	I'm assuming that you play some sort of
4310000	4312000	Emergency crew when the world
4312000	4314000	Is ending and yes it looks about right
4314000	4316000	Actually so that's kind of cool
4316000	4318000	It says warning the world as we know it is out of
4318000	4320000	Control as the head of
4320000	4322000	All rescue operations you
4322000	4324000	Must ensure that you get the job
4324000	4326000	Done with fire and rescue services
4326000	4328000	Yeah I don't think fire and rescue services
4328000	4330000	Are going to stop a tidal wave from
4330000	4332000	Wiping out a city
4332000	4334000	I don't think that really works
4334000	4336000	But they'll try
4336000	4338000	They will try
4338000	4340000	Hold back that wave with your axe there
4340000	4342000	Um and then apparently Ghost Trick
4342000	4344000	Phantom Detective is supposed to be out
4344000	4346000	As well on Nintendo DS
4346000	4348000	And that is it
4348000	4350000	Traveling over to Japan this week
4350000	4352000	Uh not this week
4352000	4354000	But next week is when you start to see some stuff
4354000	4356000	On the 360 like Arcana Heart 3
4356000	4358000	But I guess I'll reiterate that next week
4358000	4360000	On the 360 going over to the Playstation 3
4360000	4362000	Kind of the same story
4362000	4364000	There's not really a lot out there either
4364000	4366000	I'm getting the sense it's going to be a very
4366000	4368000	Slow week
4368000	4370000	Nintendo Wii you don't even see anything until the end of the month
4370000	4372000	That's the crazy stuff
4372000	4374000	But the DS
4374000	4376000	The DS probably has your one highlight and big game this week
4376000	4378000	Saga 3
4378000	4380000	Jiko no Hasa
4380000	4382000	Shadow or Light comes out this week
4382000	4384000	That of course is in the Saga series
4384000	4386000	Right by Squeenix
4386000	4388000	On the DS and that's probably the big one
4388000	4390000	That people are going to be looking at and importing
4390000	4392000	When I look at the screenshots of this game
4392000	4394000	I really kind of go oh it's like a Saga game
4394000	4396000	That kind of looks like those Final Fantasy remakes they did on the DS
4396000	4398000	That's pretty much what you got there
4398000	4400000	So if you like the Saga series you'll probably be into that
4400000	4402000	And that is really it
4402000	4404000	That's like seriously the only thing
4404000	4406000	You have to look forward to this week
4406000	4408000	Um the PSP does have a slot machine
4408000	4410000	Game coming out but do you really care?
4410000	4412000	I don't think you do
4412000	4414000	So
4414000	4416000	A slot machine game you said?
4416000	4418000	Yes
4418000	4420000	You know that would actually do really well over here to get into
4420000	4422000	With the elderly market
4422000	4424000	Can I talk about Europe now?
4424000	4426000	I guess you can
4426000	4428000	Well um on the first there was
4428000	4430000	UFC trainer like no one really
4430000	4432000	Gives a crap about that
4432000	4434000	And on the fourth Lost in Shadow and guess what
4434000	4436000	That's it
4436000	4438000	Very slow week but you know the holiday
4438000	4440000	Shopping fever is gone so
4440000	4442000	Geez people
4442000	4444000	In two weeks we got two great games on the PS3
4444000	4446000	Isn't that ironic
4446000	4448000	Alright
4448000	4450000	Well we got a couple more stories for you guys
4450000	4452000	And then the classic game of the week
4452000	4454000	We'll close out part A in just a moment
4454000	4456000	Yes one of the bitches that we had last year
4456000	4458000	With Ubisoft with their
4458000	4460000	Really odd
4460000	4462000	Use of
4462000	4464000	DRM
4464000	4466000	They had a
4466000	4468000	Basically you had to be connected
4468000	4470000	To their servers the entire time
4470000	4472000	While you're playing different games
4472000	4474000	And if for whatever reason you
4474000	4476000	Feature or had some sort of
4476000	4478000	Connection problem whether it be just
4478000	4480000	A quick you know disconnect
4480000	4482000	Your game would actually stop
4482000	4484000	And you would have no opportunity to save or whatever
4484000	4486000	It would just totally fuck you up
4486000	4488000	And that was on even like single player games
4488000	4490000	Like Assassin's Creed 2
4490000	4492000	Or Splinter Cell Conviction
4492000	4494000	Well apparently though
4494000	4496000	There has been an update I guess
4496000	4498000	That
4498000	4500000	Those DRM checks are a little bit
4500000	4502000	Easier now
4502000	4504000	In fact on games
4504000	4506000	I guess like Assassin's Creed 2
4506000	4508000	And Splinter Cell Conviction for example
4508000	4510000	They have now
4510000	4512000	Made it where it just has to check
4512000	4514000	With the servers when you boot the game
4514000	4516000	But if you lose your internet connection
4516000	4518000	While playing the game it will not
4518000	4520000	Actually interfere with your game at all
4520000	4522000	So that's kind of cool
4522000	4524000	But also makes me think that it doesn't matter
4524000	4526000	Because people got around the stupid hacks
4526000	4528000	People don't want to deal with it
4528000	4530000	They won't that's the reality
4530000	4532000	They got around it anyways and all it
4532000	4534000	Really hurt was the people that bought
4534000	4536000	The game legitimately so
4536000	4538000	I don't know
4538000	4540000	But at least it's not
4540000	4542000	As terrible
4542000	4544000	Alright
4544000	4546000	Well kind of
4546000	4548000	One of the big stories from the end of last year was
4548000	4550000	The fact that Harmonix was being unloaded
4550000	4552000	By Viacom and it looks like we might have
4552000	4554000	Some resolution finally to this
4554000	4556000	A press release that came out over the holiday
4556000	4558000	From John Drake saying
4558000	4560000	That who is that Harmonix obviously
4560000	4562000	We are happy to confirm that the news today
4562000	4564000	That the sale of the company is complete
4564000	4566000	Viacom and MTV networks have been an
4566000	4568000	Amazing home for the past four years
4568000	4570000	Blah blah blah fluff fluff right
4570000	4572000	It's where we launched Rock Band and Dance Central
4572000	4574000	Beatles, Green Day, blah blah blah
4574000	4576000	We're excited to be returning to our roots as an
4576000	4578000	Independent and privately owned studio
4578000	4580000	And what this means the
4580000	4582000	DLC schedule marches on for
4582000	4584000	Rock Band, we will continue our support of
4584000	4586000	Previously released titles, and we're hard at
4586000	4588000	Work at some unannounced projects that we think
4588000	4590000	You're going to be pumped about
4590000	4592000	And the other half of this, it wasn't in the press release
4592000	4594000	But it was confirmed they are keeping the licenses
4594000	4596000	For Dance Central and Rock Band, they will get to
4596000	4598000	If they decide to make Rock Band 4
4598000	4600000	Or Dance Central 2
4600000	4602000	I think at least one of those is a sure thing
4602000	4604000	I would honestly say
4604000	4606000	I don't think Rock Band 4 is a sure thing at this point
4606000	4608000	I think Harmonix might do
4608000	4610000	Something new
4610000	4612000	The whole plastic instrument thing
4612000	4614000	But they may not call it Rock Band
4614000	4616000	And I think that's okay
4616000	4618000	I think sometimes your series needs a swift kick in the pants
4618000	4620000	So I would be
4620000	4622000	Quite okay with that if they decide
4622000	4624000	I'd be okay with Dance Central 2
4624000	4626000	I would be totally okay with Dance Central 2
4626000	4628000	And I think that's a sure thing
4628000	4630000	Of course there's going to be a Dance Central 2
4630000	4632000	Absolutely, it was clearly the biggest game on Connect
4632000	4634000	I'm so happy, we took down the tree today
4634000	4636000	The Christmas tree, so that we were able to move the
4636000	4638000	Coffee table out from the middle of the room again
4638000	4640000	And connect space again
4640000	4642000	Congratulations, there you go
4642000	4644000	So there it is, Harmonix going independent
4644000	4646000	That's a very
4646000	4648000	Kind of an obvious resolution
4648000	4650000	That none of us had guessed previously
4650000	4652000	So good luck
4652000	4654000	You kind of think
4654000	4656000	When people are talking about selling a company
4656000	4658000	It's like
4658000	4660000	You never really think, hey they could just buy themselves
4660000	4662000	Because they probably have a lot of money
4662000	4664000	Right?
4664000	4666000	Well, good luck to Harmonix
4666000	4668000	Pay off for them, we'll see
4668000	4670000	Anyway, let's take a minute not to talk about the future
4670000	4672000	Or this year, the coming year
4672000	4674000	But to reflect on the past
4674000	4676000	And gaming's history and how we all got here
4676000	4678000	To 2011 and gaming
4678000	4680000	It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week
4680000	4682000	In this segment, DarkSakura
4682000	4684000	Is going to go through the archives
4684000	4686000	In her cavernous vault
4686000	4688000	That she has here in the house
4688000	4690000	And find a game that she says, hey
4690000	4692000	It's not that big
4692000	4694000	Listen kids, you should be playing this game
4694000	4696000	Respect your elderly games
4696000	4698000	And what game did you pick this week?
4698000	4700000	Hard Drivin'
4700000	4702000	As in the nap machine
4702000	4704000	I will go into why it's the nap machine later
4704000	4706000	So forget all this
4706000	4708000	Need for speed stuff
4708000	4710000	Listen to those really great sound effects
4710000	4712000	Bong bong
4712000	4714000	Listen for a minute
4714000	4716000	That's about as much music as the game has
4716000	4718000	As a drum roll
4718000	4720000	Serious
4720000	4722000	Well then listen to some squeaking breaks
4722000	4724000	Listen to DarkSakura, tell us about this game
4724000	4726000	Hard Drivin' was basically
4726000	4728000	It was touted
4728000	4730000	According to this poster
4730000	4732000	As the world's first authentic driving simulation
4732000	4734000	Game
4734000	4736000	It was the first 3D polygon
4736000	4738000	Driving environment
4738000	4740000	It used a simulated cabinet
4740000	4742000	Virtual reality, oh my god, lawnmower man
4742000	4744000	It's real
4744000	4746000	And it was all on custom hardware
4746000	4748000	It had force feedback
4748000	4750000	A car physics simulator
4750000	4752000	And most of the
4752000	4754000	Design was done by
4754000	4756000	Some dude named Max Behensky
4756000	4758000	So that's pretty cool
4758000	4760000	Now also keep in mind that
4760000	4762000	Other games that came out around this time like
4762000	4764000	Pole Position and Outrun were sprite based
4764000	4766000	Scaling
4768000	4770000	Ah, you found the best part
4770000	4772000	The instant replay, trying to go up that loop
4772000	4774000	Basically, instead of
4774000	4776000	Having the sort of artificial graphics
4776000	4778000	Where the car wouldn't land
4778000	4780000	The right, you know, right side up
4780000	4782000	Or, you know
4782000	4784000	It actually used very realistic
4784000	4786000	Physics in the game
4786000	4788000	When you went too far off track
4788000	4790000	You would crash your skin
4790000	4792000	Your windshield would crack
4792000	4794000	You could keep driving
4794000	4796000	And then it also gave you the replay
4796000	4798000	Where you would die
4798000	4800000	And a hideous car fire
4800000	4802000	But you gotta admit, some of it's a little janky
4802000	4804000	Like the car explodes and then suddenly
4804000	4806000	In the next frame it's back together
4806000	4808000	It's very jank
4808000	4810000	We are very spoiled by today's graphics
4810000	4812000	Keep in mind, this was 1988
4812000	4814000	And this was a polygon game
4814000	4816000	In 1988
4816000	4818000	Wow, car explosions
4818000	4820000	Do not work that way
4820000	4822000	The car that you're supposed to be in
4822000	4824000	Is sort of like a Ferrari Testarossa
4824000	4826000	So I mean, that's pretty cool
4826000	4828000	You basically
4828000	4830000	Race
4830000	4832000	Against
4832000	4834000	This car called the Phantom Photon
4834000	4836000	And you can race the wrong way
4836000	4838000	You can do all this other stuff
4838000	4840000	It's actually, you know
4840000	4842000	It has, um, also
4842000	4844000	You can play it in automatic
4844000	4846000	You also have a realistic manual
4846000	4848000	Transmission with a clutch and everything
4848000	4850000	You can stall the car
4850000	4852000	When you miss shift
4852000	4854000	And, you know, like I said, force feedback and everything
4854000	4856000	So it's meant to be a driving simulator
4856000	4858000	And, you know
4858000	4860000	This game was
4860000	4862000	Pretty crazy for its time
4862000	4864000	It was put out by Atari
4864000	4866000	And
4866000	4868000	You know, they
4868000	4870000	This was really one of the coolest ones
4870000	4872000	For the record, the
4872000	4874000	Genesis version of this game is shit
4874000	4876000	Utter, utter shit
4876000	4878000	Oh, the Super Nintendo one was shit too
4878000	4880000	Yeah, um, so
4880000	4882000	As far as sequels that came out
4882000	4884000	There was Race Driving
4884000	4886000	In 1990, Hard Drivin' 2
4886000	4888000	Drive Harder that came out, um
4888000	4890000	On the
4890000	4892000	Yeah, on the Atari ST
4892000	4894000	And Commodore Amiga
4894000	4896000	An unreleased one called Hard Drivin'
4896000	4898000	Airborne in 1993
4898000	4900000	And then Street Drivin' that came out in 2001
4900000	4902000	On the GameCube, Playstation 2 and
4902000	4904000	Xbox, um, different versions
4904000	4906000	Came out, there
4906000	4908000	Hard Drivin' 3, now it's hard
4910000	4912000	Hard Drivin' 4 in my pants
4912000	4914000	Now, um
4914000	4916000	This that I'm gonna quote on here is that
4916000	4918000	The engine, transmission, control, suspension and
4918000	4920000	Physics were modeled in conjunction with
4920000	4922000	Doug Milliken who was listed
4922000	4924000	As a test driver in the game credits
4924000	4926000	So, um, that's actually
4926000	4928000	Pretty cool, um, this says that his father
4928000	4930000	William Milliken of Milliken
4930000	4932000	Research led a team at Cornell
4932000	4934000	Aeronautical Laboratory
4934000	4936000	In Buffalo, New York that converted
4936000	4938000	Aircraft equations of motion
4938000	4940000	To equations of motion for the automobile
4940000	4942000	So it was a
4942000	4944000	You know, they actually used real science
4944000	4946000	In it, which I thought was pretty cool, it was meant to be a real
4946000	4948000	Stimulator
4948000	4950000	Um, as far as Easter Eggs
4950000	4952000	In the game, one of the buildings along
4952000	4954000	The speed course, um
4954000	4956000	Has a sign that says, uh, sorry
4956000	4958000	A sign above the door that says, The Hut
4958000	4960000	Um, if
4960000	4962000	If you made a hard left turn at the start
4962000	4964000	Of the game, you have a secret track
4964000	4966000	Which is a long straight road that leads to
4966000	4968000	A very short circular track
4968000	4970000	Around a tower
4970000	4972000	If you slow down and stop in front of one of the buildings
4972000	4974000	A keyhole appears in the building door
4974000	4976000	What?
4976000	4978000	Running into a cow will cause a moo sound to be played
4978000	4980000	At least in the Sega Genesis port
4980000	4982000	There's exactly one cow
4982000	4984000	Um, and
4984000	4986000	Ate carefully
4986000	4988000	After getting a sufficiently high score
4988000	4990000	Then, um, you get a full course race against the
4990000	4992000	Phantom Photon on the stunt track
4992000	4994000	So it's pretty cool
4994000	4996000	Um, but, now I have to tell you
4996000	4998000	About, now I'm gonna
4998000	5000000	Put a picture of the cabinet in the chatroom
5000000	5002000	Um, for a reason
5002000	5004000	For a specific reason
5004000	5006000	This thing had
5006000	5008000	A chair that would swivel out
5008000	5010000	And
5010000	5012000	Inside it was very dark
5012000	5014000	So one day when I was working at
5014000	5016000	Cyber station at Bel Air Mall
5016000	5018000	In Mobile, Alabama
5018000	5020000	There was nobody
5020000	5022000	In the damn mall
5022000	5024000	It was Tuesday morning
5024000	5026000	I had been up all night, so guess what I did?
5026000	5028000	I sat my happy butt
5028000	5030000	Inside the chair at hard driving
5030000	5032000	I filled myself in, and I took a three hour nap
5032000	5034000	Well, you know, not like a
5034000	5036000	A full on nap
5036000	5038000	I could still hear people
5038000	5040000	No one came in
5040000	5042000	I got all my other stuff done
5042000	5044000	And I sat in the hard driving machine
5044000	5046000	And took a three hour nap
5046000	5048000	It was dark, the chair was comfortable
5048000	5050000	How colossally irresponsible of you, but funny
5050000	5052000	Oh please
5052000	5054000	I was 19
5054000	5056000	So
5056000	5058000	But at any rate
5058000	5060000	That's my story about the hard driving cabinet
5060000	5062000	It's the great nap machine
5062000	5064000	The game actually, I'll be honest
5064000	5066000	I don't like playing hard driving
5066000	5068000	It's hard
5068000	5070000	And time has not treated it well
5070000	5072000	No it hasn't
5072000	5074000	But it's notable for what it is
5074000	5076000	I gotta click on this link
5076000	5078000	Cause there's a YouTube suggestion here
5078000	5080000	The worst Genesis game ever made
5080000	5082000	Hard driving
5082000	5084000	I just wanna remind myself how fucking terrible this is
5084000	5086000	Okay, I don't wanna hear some asshole
5086000	5088000	Talking about it, I just wanna see it here
5088000	5090000	Oh yeah, with the
5090000	5092000	And I say that with love
5092000	5094000	Crazy ass draw in on the thing
5094000	5096000	Oh my god, the framery on here is so awful
5096000	5098000	It's hideous, it's hideous
5098000	5100000	But I mean
5100000	5102000	God, can you imagine that people
5102000	5104000	Somebody somewhere actually dropped like $50 on this game
5104000	5106000	I know
5106000	5108000	It's one freaking track, right?
5108000	5110000	You missed the cow, Rob, you missed the cow
5110000	5112000	Well I'm gonna burn in hell for all eternity
5112000	5114000	For missing the damn cow
5114000	5116000	I like Test Drive 3
5116000	5118000	And it came out around the same time
5118000	5120000	Looked very similar to this
5120000	5122000	And they, um
5122000	5124000	They came out after this
5124000	5126000	You also have to race other cars
5126000	5128000	And I used to try to take a shortcut by driving off-road
5128000	5130000	Not something a performance
5130000	5132000	High speed vehicle is meant to do
5132000	5134000	But I did encounter lots of deer
5134000	5136000	Deer
5136000	5138000	Rob's looking at the Commodore 64
5138000	5140000	Yes, Commodore 64 hard driving
5140000	5142000	I have to see this
5142000	5144000	Wow
5144000	5146000	It's like $10
5146000	5148000	And this framery is awful
5148000	5150000	Oh wow
5150000	5152000	You could grow old playing this game
5152000	5154000	Imagine
5154000	5156000	I know this is terrible radio
5156000	5158000	Imagine you're playing, I'll link it in the chat
5158000	5160000	But for those listening on the podcast
5160000	5162000	Imagine you're playing hard driving on the Game Boy
5162000	5164000	The old Game Boy
5164000	5166000	Like the old Game Boy
5166000	5168000	Monochrome
5168000	5170000	There's the link in chat
5170000	5172000	Somebody spent $50 on this game
5172000	5174000	Just so you know
5174000	5176000	Is there a loop even?
5176000	5178000	Oh no, here's the bridge
5178000	5180000	Crash
5180000	5182000	Actually, you might get better
5182000	5184000	You might get a faster framerate on the Game Boy
5184000	5186000	And then that was, wow
5186000	5188000	Rama in our chat room says
5188000	5190000	I worked in a video store when this game came out
5190000	5192000	It did pretty well in sales
5192000	5194000	Because it's virtual reality, man
5194000	5196000	It's crazy, wave of the future
5196000	5198000	Or something
5198000	5200000	At any rate
5200000	5202000	Like I said
5202000	5204000	I'm not a fan of the game itself
5204000	5206000	However, I will
5206000	5208000	You're a big fan of naps
5208000	5210000	I love naps
5210000	5212000	But I will give it props
5212000	5214000	For what it is and what it did at the time
5214000	5216000	If not for hard driving
5216000	5218000	We may not have Ridge Racer
5218000	5220000	That's true
5220000	5222000	This is
5222000	5224000	The beginning of our 3D racing games
5224000	5226000	Right here
5226000	5228000	Even though this game really
5228000	5230000	Hasn't been treated well with time
5230000	5232000	And it's kind of shit now
5232000	5234000	Without it, we wouldn't have some of the stuff we have today
5234000	5236000	Because people
5236000	5238000	Like to do loopy loops and jumpy jumps
5238000	5240000	I just figured I took so many damn naps in the machine
5240000	5242000	I may as well play it a couple of times
5242000	5244000	I'll tell you something else that's funny
5244000	5246000	I want to tell it to other people
5246000	5248000	Who have worked in an arcade
5248000	5250000	We got an allotment of 25 tokens a week
5250000	5252000	Tell me
5252000	5254000	Once you started working at the arcade
5254000	5256000	Stop using your damn tokens
5256000	5258000	Did you not play anything for a while?
5258000	5260000	Because you were tired of being there
5260000	5262000	When I quit Rob, seriously
5262000	5264000	I had 600 and something tokens
5264000	5266000	I played a lot of Skee-Ball
5266000	5268000	And a lot of Street Fighter Alpha 2
5268000	5270000	5th Dream in our chat room says
5270000	5272000	VR without glasses
5272000	5274000	Without glasses, sound like anything recent?
5274000	5276000	I see what you did there
5276000	5278000	Alright
5278000	5280000	That may be a very topical
5280000	5282000	And appropriate game of the week
5282000	5284000	It might be a lot
5284000	5286000	Crazier than you think
5286000	5288000	There it is, a classic game of the week
5288000	5290000	Hard driving
5290000	5292000	On various systems
5292000	5294000	But we're going to give it to the arcade
5294000	5296000	Because the arcade one can nap in
5296000	5298000	And definitely not the Commodore 64
5298000	5300000	Definitely not that one
5300000	5302000	Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange
5302000	5304000	Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere, we're not done
5304000	5306000	We've got plenty more show to go
5306000	5308000	We're going to talk about Chrono Trigger
5308000	5310000	Super Meat Boy, Valve, Indie Games
5310000	5312000	The 3DS, yes more
5312000	5314000	But we have some actual big news about it
5314000	5316000	So we're going to talk about all that when we come back with more
5316000	5318000	Of Orange Lounge Radio, so don't go anywhere
5324000	5326000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
5326000	5328000	The show where every gamer has a voice
5328000	5330000	We're taping episode number 395
5330000	5332000	Tonight, January the 2nd of
5332000	5334000	2011, it's our first show of 2011
5334000	5336000	Rob Roberts here with you
5336000	5338000	Over the next few hours, of course DarkSakura, Loki
5338000	5340000	And our special guest tonight, Gary here in studio
5340000	5342000	Talking about video games and so forth
5342000	5344000	We're going to get into the rapid fire news
5344000	5346000	In just a minute, but first
5346000	5348000	Some quick plugs for some other shows that we here
5348000	5350000	At OLR are branching out into
5350000	5352000	By the way, special thanks to the
5352000	5354000	Forces that be at our website for putting the little
5354000	5356000	Links now right there on OrangeLoungeRadio.com
5356000	5358000	So if you're curious about some of the other shows
5358000	5360000	We do, they are all right there
5360000	5362000	So DarkSakura does a show, it's called
5362000	5364000	Comic Insanity
5364000	5366000	Talks a lot about comic books
5366000	5368000	Yep, and we are dark until
5368000	5370000	Next week, so we will be recording
5370000	5372000	Again this next weekend
5372000	5374000	All right, the best
5374000	5376000	Little Horde House in Azeroth
5376000	5378000	My little show about Warcraft, which by the way
5378000	5380000	Had some Comic Insanity crossover this week
5380000	5382000	Tiara was our special guest, or Maron Marvel
5382000	5384000	From that show, so it's a good one to listen to
5384000	5386000	It was actually a really good show this week I had to say
5386000	5388000	So check that out at
5388000	5390000	Our link in iTunes
5390000	5392000	We don't really have a website yet, working on it
5392000	5394000	So search us in iTunes
5394000	5396000	Horde House, H-O-R-D-E space
5396000	5398000	H-O-U-S-E, or we are linked
5398000	5400000	Right there at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
5400000	5402000	We have a blog spot technically, but that's just what
5402000	5404000	We use to link our feeds, so we don't
5404000	5406000	Don't take that too seriously
5406000	5408000	Anyhow, that's that
5408000	5410000	Let's get into some quick news
5410000	5412000	Some rapid news, believe it or not
5412000	5414000	There was still some stuff that happened in the gaming world
5414000	5416000	This week, so
5416000	5418000	Believe it or not, few things
5418000	5420000	Christmas doesn't stop everything
5420000	5422000	So it was announced
5422000	5424000	This week at Pokemon Black and White
5424000	5426000	We'll be headed over to
5426000	5428000	North America on March 6
5428000	5430000	You'll be able to play with your
5430000	5432000	Pokemans on that date
5432000	5434000	And of course the two versions
5434000	5436000	Will have slightly different
5438000	5440000	Themes to them I guess this time
5440000	5442000	The black version will offer
5442000	5444000	Pokemon
5444000	5446000	Looks like a Reshirium
5446000	5448000	And a setting called
5448000	5450000	Black City, while white will contain
5450000	5452000	A lush green area called
5452000	5454000	White Forest
5454000	5456000	And will let you capture a Pokemon
5456000	5458000	Named Zekrom
5458000	5460000	Boy, they're having to get
5460000	5462000	Creative with the alphabet soup on these
5462000	5464000	Pokemon names, aren't they?
5464000	5466000	So
5466000	5468000	Those are actually going to be
5468000	5470000	Coming March 6
5470000	5472000	On the
5472000	5474000	Nintendo DS
5474000	5476000	Also
5476000	5478000	Not really coinciding
5478000	5480000	With that, but next month
5480000	5482000	There's going to be some
5484000	5486000	Pokemon downloads available
5486000	5488000	At GameStop and Toys R Us
5488000	5490000	This is actually happening between
5490000	5492000	January 30th and February 5th
5492000	5494000	At Toys R Us
5494000	5496000	You're going to be able to pick up
5496000	5498000	Ash's
5498000	5500000	Pikachu
5500000	5502000	A version of that character
5502000	5504000	With a special set of abilities at Toys R Us
5504000	5506000	I guess
5506000	5508000	He starts off at
5508000	5510000	Level 50
5510000	5512000	Cool, I guess
5512000	5514000	Some other stuff you can check out
5514000	5516000	Of course at GameStop
5516000	5518000	During
5518000	5520000	I guess during different weeks
5520000	5522000	They're going to have different Pokemon you can download
5522000	5524000	January 3rd through the 9th
5524000	5526000	They have
5526000	5528000	Raikou
5528000	5530000	Looks like 17th through 23rd
5530000	5532000	And Tai
5532000	5534000	And
5534000	5536000	Looks like
5536000	5538000	Entei, I guess
5538000	5540000	31st through February 6th
5540000	5542000	Suisin
5542000	5544000	And
5544000	5546000	That means nothing to me, by the way
5546000	5548000	Because I don't play Pokemon
5548000	5550000	Nor do I understand what any of these
5550000	5552000	Really flamboyant
5552000	5554000	Slightly mythological creatures
5554000	5556000	That almost looks like a dog
5556000	5558000	But if you want to be
5558000	5560000	The very best
5560000	5562000	No one ever was
5562000	5564000	You gotta catch them all
5564000	5566000	It's like STDs
5566000	5568000	To train them is your cause
5568000	5570000	Gotta catch them all
5570000	5572000	Uh
5572000	5574000	Something that
5574000	5576000	I'm not sure a lot of people may be wanting to catch
5576000	5578000	Do you think antibiotics could
5578000	5580000	Clear up a bad case of the Pokemans?
5580000	5582000	I'm on a strong
5582000	5584000	Dose of antibiotics right now
5584000	5586000	And I have no
5586000	5588000	Urge to play Pokemans
5588000	5590000	So maybe
5590000	5592000	Dynasty Warriors 7
5592000	5594000	Is coming to North America
5594000	5596000	March 22nd
5596000	5598000	And it will be, I guess, the first version
5598000	5600000	That will include 3D
5600000	5602000	And move support, of course on the Playstation 3
5602000	5604000	And I guess
5604000	5606000	The game will also be on Xbox 360
5606000	5608000	As well
5608000	5610000	Some new stuff that's gonna be in the game
5610000	5612000	Apparently they have a
5612000	5614000	Free roam mode dubbed Chronicle mode
5614000	5616000	There's gonna be 60 playable characters
5616000	5618000	And I believe online co-op
5618000	5620000	Is the other brand new thing
5622000	5624000	So yay
5624000	5626000	And then last but not least
5626000	5628000	As
5628000	5630000	A lot of games seem to
5630000	5632000	Kind of go this route
5632000	5634000	Devil Summoner Soul Hackers
5634000	5636000	Is a game that I guess came out on the Saturn
5636000	5638000	Back in Japan in 1997
5638000	5640000	It has not been released
5640000	5642000	Over here in North America
5642000	5644000	Or has gotten an English release anywhere in the world
5644000	5646000	I remember that game
5646000	5648000	So now
5648000	5650000	A group of hackers calling themselves
5650000	5652000	Devil Hackers
5652000	5654000	What a friendly name
5654000	5656000	They're working on a fan made
5656000	5658000	Translation of the title for
5658000	5660000	The PSP
5660000	5662000	And of course
5662000	5664000	They have a teaser trailer
5664000	5666000	For it, but it's like 13 minutes long
5666000	5668000	So that's a big tease
5668000	5670000	That's a long trailer, geez
5670000	5672000	That is a long trailer
5672000	5674000	I mean, do we really need to watch a trailer of
5674000	5676000	Like, hey look, the game's in English now
5676000	5678000	I mean, this, I don't know
5678000	5680000	You know what, I hadn't heard about this game
5680000	5682000	Until tonight, so maybe some people just need to
5682000	5684000	Know about its epic epicness
5684000	5686000	Maybe
5686000	5688000	Hey, speaking of epic, Rock Band
5688000	5690000	Is a very epic music game
5690000	5692000	And there's an epic musician coming to the game
5692000	5694000	This week, and it doesn't get any better
5694000	5696000	Than Johnny Cash, ladies and gentlemen
5696000	5698000	Coming this week to Rock Band
5698000	5700000	And it's a big pack of
5700000	5702000	8 songs that you can get for
5702000	5704000	About, what is that
5704000	5706000	1080 Microsoft points
5706000	5708000	It's about 14 bucks and all said and done
5708000	5710000	Cry Cry Cry
5710000	5712000	Don't Take Your Guns to Town
5712000	5714000	Five Feet High and Rising
5714000	5716000	Folsom Prison Blues
5716000	5718000	I Got Stripes
5718000	5720000	I Walk the Line
5720000	5722000	Tennessee Flat Top Box
5722000	5724000	And the Ballad of Ira Hayes
5724000	5726000	Awesome
5726000	5728000	Also, if that wasn't good enough, Dark Soccer
5728000	5730000	Free songs coming out this week
5730000	5732000	Free shit
5732000	5734000	It is 9 songs for free
5734000	5736000	It's the Rock Band pack
5736000	5738000	It's just merry freaking January
5738000	5740000	There it is, 9 songs for free
5740000	5742000	They are all, of course, indie bands that
5742000	5744000	Kind of have ties to harmonics like Bang Camaro
5744000	5746000	And you know, things like that
5746000	5748000	But hey, you know what, free is free
5748000	5750000	You might find some music you like
5750000	5752000	So there you go
5752000	5754000	By the way, also, some pro guitar and bass
5754000	5756000	Stuff on some of those Johnny Cash songs
5756000	5758000	Rob!
5758000	5760000	But only like I Walk the Line and Tennessee Flat
5760000	5762000	Our friend has brought over the guitar
5762000	5764000	The pro guitar
5764000	5766000	Well, I didn't get to see it used
5766000	5768000	But it was really nice
5768000	5770000	So many buttons on it
5770000	5772000	Better be nice for the price that it is
5772000	5774000	Right?
5774000	5776000	He seemed to like it
5776000	5778000	I watched him playing stuff with it
5778000	5780000	It was pretty cool
5780000	5782000	I mean, not last night, but New Years
5782000	5784000	If you
5784000	5786000	Like Rock Band 3
5786000	5788000	And you like Fallout 3
5788000	5790000	Then this song is for you
5790000	5792000	And it's on the Rock Band Network
5792000	5794000	You're going to have to dig for this one a little bit
5794000	5796000	It's Kirby Crackle
5796000	5798000	Doing the Fallout tribute song
5798000	5800000	Vault 101
5800000	5802000	And that's a little play on
5802000	5804000	Where you start in the game
5804000	5806000	Fallout 3
5806000	5808000	That's available on the Rock Band Network store
5808000	5810000	So if you like that song
5810000	5812000	There's a clip of it available on YouTube
5812000	5814000	Rock Band isn't the only game
5814000	5816000	Getting some download stuff coming
5816000	5818000	Dance Central is still kicking
5818000	5820000	It is still going
5820000	5822000	In fact, actually it came out a couple weeks ago
5822000	5824000	But we were off for the holidays
5824000	5826000	Let's see
5826000	5828000	Rihanna came out with Disturbia
5828000	5830000	Girls and Boys
5830000	5832000	By Blur
5832000	5834000	That's kind of cool
5834000	5836000	And Janet Jackson with Control
5836000	5838000	Awesome
5838000	5840000	Would you dance to Girls and Boys in Dance Central?
5840000	5842000	I know you like your Blur
5842000	5844000	Super Meat Boy
5844000	5846000	If you were waiting for this game on the Nintendo Wii
5846000	5848000	You are going to be waiting forever
5848000	5850000	That is because the Wii version of Super Meat Boy
5850000	5852000	Is gone
5852000	5854000	What it boils down to
5854000	5856000	You can read a very interesting
5856000	5858000	Press release or statement from the folks behind
5858000	5860000	Super Meat Boy
5860000	5862000	But basically, the 40 megabyte limit
5862000	5864000	Imposed on WiiWare games by Nintendo
5864000	5866000	Means the Super Meat Boy version would have been
5866000	5868000	Shit
5868000	5870000	There would have been tons of songs
5870000	5872000	The Dark World levels wouldn't have even been there
5872000	5874000	Basically, you would have gotten a
5874000	5876000	And they called it this, a shitty version of Super Meat Boy
5876000	5878000	So it would fit right in with everything else
5878000	5880000	Really
5880000	5882000	But what's kind of sad about this is that
5882000	5884000	Originally, this was announced as a WiiWare game
5884000	5886000	And so they've had to do a little bit of backtracking
5886000	5888000	Saying, hey, we know Wii originally announced this
5888000	5890000	As a WiiWare thing
5890000	5892000	But guess what?
5892000	5894000	I think it was that Nintendo was really the first
5894000	5896000	To announce it
5896000	5898000	Specifically for the Wii to begin with
5898000	5900000	They were just making a game and Nintendo kind of wanted it
5900000	5902000	And B
5902000	5904000	You know what? The game grew bigger
5904000	5906000	And it's a great game
5906000	5908000	And if you own a Wii
5908000	5910000	You probably have a PC somewhere in your house
5910000	5912000	Even if you don't have a 360
5912000	5914000	At least you can get this game somewhere
5914000	5916000	The game will not be coming out on the PlayStation 3
5916000	5918000	Due to an arrangement
5918000	5920000	With Microsoft
5920000	5922000	You can kind of read between the lines there
5922000	5924000	Dark Sakura
5924000	5926000	Well, Squeenix has decided
5926000	5928000	That they are going to
5928000	5930000	Have another Final Fantasy game
5930000	5932000	Duh!
5932000	5934000	They actually filed for a European trademark
5934000	5936000	For Final Fantasy Type 0
5936000	5938000	And has it under everything
5938000	5940000	From computer game software to toy swords
5940000	5942000	So
5942000	5944000	Maybe it'll be cool
5944000	5946000	Then we have new characters
5946000	5948000	For Tekken Tag Tournament 2
5948000	5950000	There's a Lutadora
5950000	5952000	And
5952000	5954000	They don't know her name
5954000	5956000	But she's pink!
5956000	5958000	She's wearing a rasslin' mask
5958000	5960000	She makes me think of Rainbow Mika
5960000	5962000	And it's a she
5962000	5964000	So maybe they're taking a page from Capcom's book
5964000	5966000	And then
5966000	5968000	In other news
5968000	5970000	There's actually a few more things
5970000	5972000	That are sort of cementing in
5972000	5974000	That the
5974000	5976000	Previously rumored taskmaster
5976000	5978000	Akuma and Sienkou
5978000	5980000	Are going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3
5980000	5982000	And that's in the way of
5982000	5984000	Xbox 360 achievements
5984000	5986000	There is one called
5986000	5988000	For those who dwell in darkness
5988000	5990000	And so that's going to be a team
5990000	5992000	Composed of all Darkstalkers characters
5992000	5994000	So that means three characters
5994000	5996000	So there's going to be another Darkstalker
5996000	5998000	So far we just have Felicia
5998000	6000000	And Morrigan
6000000	6002000	So all the rumors are going to Sienkou
6002000	6004000	And then there's one called Fate of the Satsui no Haro
6004000	6006000	Which is
6006000	6008000	Which is going to be
6008000	6010000	Basically the only other person
6010000	6012000	That Ryu could fight would be
6012000	6014000	Akuma
6014000	6016000	Because that's the only person in game canon
6016000	6018000	Would have that going on
6018000	6020000	Unless you count Marvel superheroes
6020000	6022000	What about the guy that's from
6022000	6024000	Super Street Fighter 4
6024000	6026000	The one that was
6026000	6028000	What was it
6028000	6030000	Not Shenlong
6030000	6032000	Or whatever
6032000	6034000	Oh, Gokun
6034000	6036000	Like, it was another character
6036000	6038000	It wasn't Akuma
6038000	6040000	Or whatever, it was supposed to be there
6040000	6042000	Yeah, Gokun
6042000	6044000	There's Sensei, that's Gokun
6044000	6046000	And he doesn't follow that
6046000	6048000	Oh
6048000	6050000	Because he's hardcore badass and has cool music
6050000	6052000	And then the other one
6052000	6054000	Of course the rumor was Taskmaster
6054000	6056000	Who, I'm like, dude, he's not even relevant
6056000	6058000	Why put him in it, but
6058000	6060000	I guess, but there's
6060000	6062000	There's supposed to be
6062000	6064000	More going on with that one
6064000	6066000	They also said there's
6066000	6068000	Another list of achievements
6068000	6070000	Among others are who will answer the call
6070000	6072000	And this achievement is
6072000	6074000	Participate in 8 player lobby
6074000	6076000	On Xbox Live, so
6076000	6078000	There's going to be lobbies
6078000	6080000	So we also
6080000	6082000	Get the Sentinel and
6082000	6084000	Hagar are also rumored to be
6084000	6086000	In it, I'm just happy
6086000	6088000	That X-23 is in it, so
6088000	6090000	That's it
6090000	6092000	Sounds like a definite purchase for you
6092000	6094000	Than Dark Sakura
6094000	6096000	Hell yeah
6096000	6098000	It doesn't even matter what character
6098000	6100000	Deadpool
6100000	6102000	I am sick of Deadpool in the comics
6102000	6104000	But I love everything else that has Deadpool in it
6104000	6106000	Does that make sense?
6106000	6108000	No, but that's okay
6108000	6110000	Twitter.com slash OLR
6110000	6112000	Every week we ask you to show us your tweets
6112000	6114000	And we will respond to them here on
6114000	6116000	The program
6116000	6118000	We're going to start tonight with a tweet
6118000	6120000	Nathan Jackson on Twitter
6120000	6122000	Question for OLR
6122000	6124000	Is the Kinect going to fundamentally change
6124000	6126000	Gaming to the point of abandoning
6126000	6128000	Controllers completely?
6128000	6130000	I'm going to give that a big fat
6130000	6132000	No, because some people
6132000	6134000	Like to touch things
6134000	6136000	They like that, and funny enough
6136000	6138000	I think that's all kind of part of Sony's
6138000	6140000	Marketing campaign is that
6140000	6142000	Sometimes people want tangible things
6142000	6144000	But
6144000	6146000	Here's case in point
6146000	6148000	There's only so much of the iPhone
6148000	6150000	Gaming I can take because I don't have those
6150000	6152000	Tangible buttons and the responsiveness
6152000	6154000	Isn't always there for me
6154000	6156000	I think they seriously need to
6156000	6158000	Aren't they supposed to be unveiling
6158000	6160000	New stuff soon or something?
6160000	6162000	I think MacWorld is coming up this week
6162000	6164000	This month
6164000	6166000	They seriously need some sort of controller thing
6166000	6168000	Or something
6168000	6170000	It would really help
6170000	6172000	Will it change gaming?
6172000	6174000	Sure, this type of technology
6174000	6176000	Has been slowly coming at us ever since
6176000	6178000	The Wii, I mean what you're seeing with
6178000	6180000	The Kinect is really just an evolution of something
6180000	6182000	We've kind of seen before
6182000	6184000	And it will evolve again
6184000	6186000	So is the Kinect
6186000	6188000	Here to stay in gaming culture?
6188000	6190000	Sure, but is it going to
6190000	6192000	Eliminate what you know of games today?
6192000	6194000	Nah, not until we have
6194000	6196000	The holodeck, once the holodeck's here
6196000	6198000	Then it's all over, because remember
6198000	6200000	And I've said this on the show a lot
6200000	6202000	Everything we do
6202000	6204000	And with every generation
6204000	6206000	Is bringing us one step closer to the holodeck
6206000	6208000	For reals
6208000	6210000	Once gaming reaches the holodeck
6210000	6212000	We're on the last generation of gaming
6212000	6214000	Even then there might be a holodeck 2.0
6214000	6216000	Huh, I don't know
6216000	6218000	Alright, let's see, moving on with some other tweets
6218000	6220000	I'm going to
6220000	6222000	DJ Rama S sends us a tweet
6222000	6224000	Interesting
6224000	6226000	EA is being sued
6226000	6228000	By gamers
6228000	6230000	Because of the football license
6230000	6232000	Exclusivity
6232000	6234000	That they have
6234000	6236000	That's the story that he's linking us to
6236000	6238000	I thought I heard about this before
6238000	6240000	Maybe something has progressed with this
6240000	6242000	I could have sworn I heard something about this before
6242000	6244000	But it was like years ago
6244000	6246000	But anyway, whatever
6246000	6248000	Let's see
6248000	6250000	They're saying
6250000	6252000	We believe EA forced consumers to pay an artificial premium
6252000	6254000	On Madden NFL video games
6254000	6256000	We intend to prove that EA could inflate prices
6256000	6258000	On their sports titles
6258000	6260000	Because these exclusive licenses
6260000	6262000	Restrain trade and competition
6262000	6264000	For interactive sports software
6264000	6266000	Because, you know, when NFL 2K5 came out
6266000	6268000	It was only 20 bucks
6268000	6270000	And EA had to sell Madden 2005
6270000	6272000	At 30 bucks
6272000	6274000	And then once the exclusive deal hit
6274000	6276000	Well shit, those games just cost like 60 bucks
6276000	6278000	Since then
6278000	6280000	They want anybody who's purchased
6280000	6282000	An EA football game since August 2005
6282000	6284000	To get damages in this settlement
6284000	6286000	Which if it ends up being this whole class action thing
6286000	6288000	Means every person will probably get 50 cents
6290000	6292000	Hope you retained all your proof of purchases
6292000	6294000	For these 5 year old games
6294000	6296000	Good luck
6296000	6298000	By the way, yeah, I knew this was old
6298000	6300000	It was originally filed in mid 2008
6300000	6302000	But, what's new about it
6302000	6304000	A judge has recently allowed
6304000	6306000	This lawsuit to proceed
6306000	6308000	I thought I'd heard about this before
6308000	6310000	It was just that long ago
6310000	6312000	But it's moving forward, it wasn't laughed out of court
6312000	6314000	So that could be interesting
6314000	6316000	A story for us
6316000	6318000	From TigerClaw305
6318000	6320000	About the
6320000	6322000	Galaga World Record attempt
6322000	6324000	Let's see
6324000	6326000	Andrew Laidlaw
6326000	6328000	Of Washington State
6328000	6330000	Has claimed the Galaga
6330000	6332000	Record, and he did it on
6332000	6334000	New Year's Day
6334000	6336000	4,525,150 points
6336000	6338000	As certified by
6338000	6340000	Twin Galaxies, because you know
6340000	6342000	They carry the spirit stick
6342000	6344000	They say it goes, so they are the authority
6344000	6346000	On video game high scores
6346000	6348000	That was a record taken from
6348000	6350000	Phil Day, who set a
6350000	6352000	3.2 million record in November
6352000	6354000	Of 2009
6354000	6356000	He said, quote, the first time was magical
6356000	6358000	In a way, this time it's a huge
6358000	6360000	Relief. Well, congratulations
6360000	6362000	A lot could be said about
6362000	6364000	Sex, that way
6364000	6366000	I was gonna say, you know
6366000	6368000	Ability to perform
6368000	6370000	Under stress
6370000	6372000	Oh, you crazy kids
6372000	6374000	That's gonna do it for the tweeters tonight
6374000	6376000	TigerClaw linked us another story, but it's coming up a little later in the show
6376000	6378000	Also Spaznator is
6378000	6380000	Not enjoying the changes
6380000	6382000	To the feed, because he's not able to tune in
6382000	6384000	Remember guys, allgames.com
6384000	6386000	Is really the best place for you to tune in
6386000	6388000	It is HTML5 compliant
6388000	6390000	I think the only people that are getting screwed are the PSP people
6390000	6392000	Because I'm not sure the PSP browser
6392000	6394000	Supports the HTML5
6394000	6396000	Hopefully there will be a solution for you guys
6396000	6398000	Soon, but yeah
6398000	6400000	A lot of change-a-roonies going around at all games
6400000	6402000	Radio, from what I understand
6402000	6404000	Not bad stuff, just, you know
6404000	6406000	New year, new stuff
6406000	6408000	Out with the old, in with the new
6408000	6410000	So some of the shows that are no longer around
6410000	6412000	They're gonna be replaced with some new live shows
6412000	6414000	So, you know, it'll be nice to have some new stuff going on
6414000	6416000	So with that comes streaming changes, et cetera, et cetera
6416000	6418000	So hopefully they get all that worked out
6418000	6420000	In the next couple weeks, and then we can update
6420000	6422000	All our fun little PSP stuffs
6422000	6424000	And get everybody back on board
6424000	6426000	Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news
6426000	6428000	Mailbag is coming up in a little bit
6428000	6430000	Mailbag at orangeontrader.com and Fuse of the Week
6430000	6432000	And of course the Skype line
6432000	6434000	But first, some more news
6434000	6436000	Oh yeah, good stuff
6436000	6438000	So this is kinda neat
6438000	6440000	You know, Valve is pretty
6440000	6442000	Kind of on the cutting edge with different things
6442000	6444000	They definitely put out a lot of popular games
6444000	6446000	And of course
6446000	6448000	One of the things that they actually have interest in doing
6448000	6450000	Is providing
6450000	6452000	Better experiences for those
6452000	6454000	Who may be disabled
6454000	6456000	For example
6456000	6458000	One of the things that they're looking on to do
6458000	6460000	Is with eye tracking
6460000	6462000	This would provide
6462000	6464000	Ways for people that, you know, for example
6464000	6466000	Don't have full body movement
6466000	6468000	To be able to play
6468000	6470000	Without having to
6470000	6472000	Use their hands
6472000	6474000	Or their entire body
6474000	6476000	As an input device
6476000	6478000	And it says
6478000	6480000	It may be possible in the future
6480000	6482000	Let the eyes act as the proxy
6482000	6484000	For the mouse cursor letting gamers
6484000	6486000	Transmit navigation
6486000	6488000	And targeting inputs via eye movements
6488000	6490000	If you couple this
6490000	6492000	With the use of blinks
6492000	6494000	And other proxies for button
6494000	6496000	Predices, you may remove
6496000	6498000	The need for a mouse and keyboard
6498000	6500000	Or gamepad altogether
6500000	6502000	So that's pretty cool
6504000	6506000	So, break this down for me
6506000	6508000	How exactly is that gonna work?
6508000	6510000	They're gonna have some sort of way
6510000	6512000	To track where your eyes are looking
6512000	6514000	And basically
6514000	6516000	They're gonna have some sort of system in place
6516000	6518000	Where, for example, say
6518000	6520000	If I blink my eyes
6520000	6522000	A certain way or something
6522000	6524000	Like a double blink or something like that
6524000	6526000	That it will act as a key press
6526000	6528000	Or maybe if I tilt my head a little bit
6528000	6530000	It's meant for gamers
6530000	6532000	That have very
6532000	6534000	Limited movement
6534000	6536000	Who's that genius guy in the wheelchair?
6536000	6538000	Stephen Hawking
6538000	6540000	Stephen Hawking games
6540000	6542000	Wasn't it
6542000	6544000	I wanna say it's Atari
6544000	6546000	But I'm not 100% certain
6546000	6548000	It had this thing called a psychic controller
6548000	6550000	All it did was control
6550000	6552000	The mind thingy
6552000	6554000	I can't remember the name of it
6554000	6556000	But it really just used
6556000	6558000	The movement of the forehead
6558000	6560000	And blinking of the eyes to do the control
6560000	6562000	It's the same concept
6562000	6564000	But now that the technology has caught up
6564000	6566000	That it could actually be
6566000	6568000	To track your retinas
6568000	6570000	An ultra-fine Kinect
6570000	6572000	Oh certainly
6572000	6574000	I think the technology has come up
6574000	6576000	Well enough to make it something viable now
6576000	6578000	I'd hate to have that
6578000	6580000	With somebody with epilepsy
6580000	6582000	That wouldn't work
6582000	6584000	But it's a neat concept
6584000	6586000	Especially though
6586000	6588000	With
6588000	6590000	I was thinking
6590000	6592000	There's other uses for head tracking out there
6592000	6594000	But that's really, I think, innovative
6594000	6596000	I'm all about
6596000	6598000	Making games more accessible
6598000	6600000	I don't know if this stuff could ever replace
6600000	6602000	But if it helps enable
6602000	6604000	And bring more people to the table, then hooray
6604000	6606000	Then maybe people won't sue
6606000	6608000	Well, you know
6608000	6610000	People will sue about what they can sue
6610000	6612000	Alright
6612000	6614000	Anyhow, Rama says in our chatroom
6614000	6616000	At chat.orangelandreary.com
6616000	6618000	I'm reminded of those special custom controllers
6618000	6620000	Nintendo put out for disabled people to play their games
6620000	6622000	Hmm
6622000	6624000	I don't even remember seeing those
6624000	6626000	But of course
6626000	6628000	I never bought one
6628000	6630000	But I think I remember seeing it on a TV show
6630000	6632000	Or something
6632000	6634000	Anyway, moving on
6634000	6636000	This is something very exciting
6636000	6638000	What is old is new again
6638000	6640000	Chrono Trigger
6640000	6642000	Yeah, that's right, the old school
6642000	6644000	Super Nintendo game
6644000	6646000	Is apparently coming back all over again
6646000	6648000	Sit down, it's not a sequel
6648000	6650000	But it's the inevitable
6650000	6652000	Mobile version of the game
6652000	6654000	There's a teaser site up now
6654000	6656000	On Squeenix's Japanese
6656000	6658000	Website
6658000	6660000	That apparently a mobile phone version of Chrono Trigger
6660000	6662000	Is on the way
6662000	6664000	Spring 2011 is the release
6664000	6666000	Very interesting
6666000	6668000	Now here's the thing to consider
6668000	6670000	If it's coming out of mobile phones in Japan
6670000	6672000	Especially the way this thing looks
6672000	6674000	With the whole PSP style upgrade graphics
6674000	6676000	I'm really reading really far into this
6676000	6678000	But the font they use on
6678000	6680000	The 2011 Spring
6680000	6682000	Looks like some of the fonts I see in the Final Fantasy remakes
6682000	6684000	Yeah, I'm jumping way ahead with this guys
6684000	6686000	But the point is
6686000	6688000	It probably will inevitably come out for the iPhone
6688000	6690000	That was wordy
6690000	6692000	Wasn't it? Probably will inevitably, whatever
6692000	6694000	It's probably going to come out for the iPhone
6694000	6696000	At some point, I just don't want to guarantee it
6696000	6698000	Because I don't know anything
6698000	6700000	But hey, Secret of Mana just came out on the iPhone
6700000	6702000	Did you know that on the iPad?
6702000	6704000	I didn't like the way it controls, but that's just me
6704000	6706000	Of course, because the controls on the iPhone suck
6706000	6708000	Like, trying to emulate that whole control pad
6708000	6710000	Just doesn't work
6710000	6712000	I have yet to see a game that it works in
6712000	6714000	The best iPhone games are the ones that
6714000	6716000	Evolve either just tapping
6716000	6718000	And not like having to emulate a control
6718000	6720000	Or tilting, like everything else
6720000	6722000	Kind of blows
6722000	6724000	I will disagree
6724000	6726000	There are two games that it works on
6726000	6728000	And they're both cave games
6728000	6730000	One is for
6730000	6732000	Espaluda
6732000	6734000	Espaluda 2
6734000	6736000	Having the drag
6736000	6738000	Across there actually works very well
6738000	6740000	And the little controller thing from Ushihime Sama
6740000	6742000	Super Bug Panic
6742000	6744000	Actually works really well too
6744000	6746000	Amiga777 in our chatroom says
6746000	6748000	Hope they don't abandon like they did for Agito
6748000	6750000	Oh, that's right, the Final Fantasy 13
6750000	6752000	Remember that? Well, keep in mind Amigo
6752000	6754000	We haven't heard anything about Versus either
6754000	6756000	So it could still be happening
6756000	6758000	Later this year
6758000	6760000	I have a feeling Final Fantasy 13 Versus
6760000	6762000	Is going to be the big thing we hear about at E3 this year
6762000	6764000	From Squeenix
6764000	6766000	At least in the JRPG camp
6766000	6768000	Because certainly they have the Tomb Raider reboot now
6768000	6770000	Isn't that weird that the Tomb Raider reboot is a Squeenix game now?
6770000	6772000	Kind of talk about this
6772000	6774000	All the different camps there
6774000	6776000	SalaciousPop in our chatroom says
6776000	6778000	They'll charge $9 for the ROM
6778000	6780000	Just like Secret of Mana for iOS
6780000	6782000	$9 for an iOS ROM hack
6782000	6784000	Well, hold on
6784000	6786000	You could kind of read into that
6786000	6788000	A couple ways
6788000	6790000	Because I don't think it's really a ROM hack
6790000	6792000	Because they do have to adapt it
6792000	6794000	For a different screen resolution
6794000	6796000	And they are putting those controls in it
6796000	6798000	$9 is still a lot though
6798000	6800000	I mean, I hear you there
6800000	6802000	But those games will inevitably come down in price
6802000	6804000	It'll be $9 this month
6804000	6806000	$7 next month
6806000	6808000	$0.99 when there's a big sale
6808000	6810000	And that's when I will finally get it
6810000	6812000	At some point
6812000	6814000	And I urge you to do the same thing
6814000	6816000	Savalas in our chatroom says
6816000	6818000	Angry Birds is amazing on iPhone
6818000	6820000	iPad, iTouch
6820000	6822000	You know I still haven't played that game
6822000	6824000	I've heard very mixed things on Angry Birds
6824000	6826000	Angry Birds is
6826000	6828000	Frustrating and fun
6828000	6830000	I've had it downloaded forever
6830000	6832000	And I still have not played it
6832000	6834000	And then they taunt you with their little snort noises
6834000	6836000	Stupid green pigs
6836000	6838000	I've played some iPhone games
6838000	6840000	I've played that Smurf village game
6840000	6842000	Finally
6842000	6844000	And I played that dungeon crawler game
6844000	6846000	That Loki gifted me a couple weeks ago
6846000	6848000	It was really pretty
6848000	6850000	But it was kind of hard to control
6850000	6852000	Well I mean
6852000	6854000	It's still really pretty
6854000	6856000	It's probably better on the iPad
6856000	6858000	I don't know, for some reason
6858000	6860000	You're so cramped on the phone
6860000	6862000	I would think on the iPad you might have a little bit better
6862000	6864000	Oh I forgot to mention
6864000	6866000	They have Raptor Call of the Shadows
6866000	6868000	On iOS now
6868000	6870000	Oh really? Remember that old shareware game?
6870000	6872000	Oh wow
6872000	6874000	How much do they want for that?
6874000	6876000	I wouldn't know
6876000	6878000	Alright
6878000	6880000	Let's move on, Dark Sakura
6880000	6882000	Meat
6882000	6884000	Meaty meat meat
6884000	6886000	Meat
6886000	6888000	Actually
6888000	6890000	Super Meat Boy is going to have some goodies coming out
6890000	6892000	More beefy goodness
6892000	6894000	Meat
6894000	6896000	With the
6896000	6898000	Next update
6898000	6900000	It's supposed to be a free PC update
6900000	6902000	There is
6902000	6904000	There is going to be
6904000	6906000	A level editor
6906000	6908000	An online level portal called Super Meat World
6908000	6910000	And something called
6910000	6912000	Enter the Unknown
6912000	6914000	But with the editor you can basically
6914000	6916000	Go
6916000	6918000	Recreate anything in the game
6918000	6920000	Except the bosses
6920000	6922000	You can actually determine
6922000	6924000	Which characters will play the level
6924000	6926000	You have all kinds of different stuff going on
6926000	6928000	But you have to hit all the validation
6928000	6930000	To make sure that you can upload it
6930000	6932000	The online level portal
6932000	6934000	Basically
6934000	6936000	Is just lets you go check out all the levels
6936000	6938000	That people have made
6938000	6940000	Super Meat World
6940000	6942000	Is a big hub
6942000	6944000	And is
6944000	6946000	What's going to bring you new chapters
6946000	6948000	To the game
6948000	6950000	And it unlocks with
6950000	6952000	30 bandages
6952000	6954000	And pops up on the map before the first
6954000	6956000	Chapter actually begins
6956000	6958000	And then Enter the Unknown which is exclusive
6958000	6960000	For the PC
6960000	6962000	Picks a random user made level
6962000	6964000	And filters it based on whatever difficulty
6964000	6966000	That you picked
6966000	6968000	So
6968000	6970000	Basically it just is giving you a random
6970000	6972000	Player created level
6972000	6974000	Based on the difficulty that you've selected
6974000	6976000	So pretty cool
6976000	6978000	That's pretty cool
6978000	6980000	That's interesting that whole random
6980000	6982000	S ability
6982000	6984000	It's Mystery Meat
6984000	6986000	That's what they should have called it was Mystery Meat
6986000	6988000	I like that
6988000	6990000	Trademark that today
6990000	6992000	That sounds so wrong
6992000	6994000	Super Meat Boy
6994000	6996000	Worst title ever
6996000	6998000	And worst, yeah I've said this a million times on the show
6998000	7000000	Worst little logo ever
7000000	7002000	But awesome game
7002000	7004000	Bandage Girl
7004000	7006000	You've got to be kidding me
7006000	7008000	I know we never did an appropriate top games
7008000	7010000	Of the year
7010000	7012000	But Super Meat Boy
7012000	7014000	Definitely would have been near my top of the list
7014000	7016000	I'm showing
7016000	7018000	I'm showing Gary the beginning of the game
7018000	7020000	This is
7020000	7022000	This is real? Wow
7022000	7024000	Loki dare I ask if you had
7024000	7026000	To pick one game for your game of the year
7026000	7028000	Last year
7028000	7030000	Is it possible? Red Dead?
7030000	7032000	That's what everybody else picked
7032000	7034000	Red Dead was alright
7034000	7036000	I don't know
7036000	7038000	I still play Grand Theft Auto though
7038000	7040000	But Red Dead was kind of cool
7040000	7042000	I don't know if I would say it's my game of the year
7042000	7044000	Though
7044000	7046000	Maybe
7046000	7048000	I can't pick one
7048000	7050000	That's why we didn't even try to do that
7050000	7052000	There was a lot of great games last year
7052000	7054000	So we just took last week off
7054000	7056000	Think about it
7056000	7058000	I know a top contender for game of the year
7058000	7060000	This year is going to be
7060000	7062000	Well what do you think?
7062000	7064000	Earth Defense Force
7064000	7066000	Insect Overgeddon
7066000	7068000	But see last year
7068000	7070000	I'm pretty sure I would have said on the end of the year
7070000	7072000	Classy 14 is going to be the best game of the year
7072000	7074000	Next year
7074000	7076000	Boy was I wrong
7076000	7078000	I'm still going to say Star Trek Online
7078000	7080000	Was my game of the year
7080000	7082000	Unfortunately it was the game that only lasted
7082000	7084000	Me a year
7084000	7086000	Mine was probably
7086000	7088000	Civ 5
7090000	7092000	He would say that
7092000	7094000	Of course I would
7094000	7096000	Anyhow
7096000	7098000	Let's move on with some more news
7098000	7100000	We've got the mailbag coming up in just a minute
7100000	7102000	We've talked a little bit about the Xbox Live
7102000	7104000	Indie Games Winter Uprising
7104000	7106000	It's a group of developers
7106000	7108000	That are putting out games on the Indie Games Store
7108000	7110000	That are kind of getting pissed
7110000	7112000	That there's a lot of crappy games out there
7112000	7114000	And a lot of clones
7114000	7116000	And ripoffs of other things
7116000	7118000	Although
7118000	7120000	If we're going to really get into
7120000	7122000	Nitpicking on the stuff
7122000	7124000	Their games aren't exactly original either
7124000	7126000	But whatever
7126000	7128000	What's cool though is Microsoft has actually
7128000	7130000	Put up a banner
7130000	7132000	Or I should say a little
7132000	7134000	Highlight spot
7134000	7136000	That you can actually check those out
7136000	7138000	From the
7138000	7140000	Xbox Live Marketplace
7140000	7142000	They actually added to their spotlight
7142000	7144000	And
7144000	7146000	I believe now all the games have been released
7146000	7148000	That are a part of that
7148000	7150000	One of the few last ones here
7150000	7152000	Cthulhu Saves the World
7152000	7154000	Apparently came out
7154000	7156000	Earlier last week
7156000	7158000	And then also they had
7158000	7160000	Breath of Death 7
7160000	7162000	Which was the last one
7162000	7164000	Cthulhu Saves the World looks like it was made with RPG Maker
7164000	7166000	But yeah
7166000	7168000	You can check those out
7168000	7170000	And check out the
7170000	7172000	Little link on Indie Games Winter Uprising
7172000	7174000	Plus there's plenty of games out there
7174000	7176000	That really need to be checked out
7176000	7178000	And a lot of them
7178000	7180000	Actually all of them have free demos
7180000	7182000	And they're cheap
7182000	7184000	A lot of them are really cheap out there
7184000	7186000	So check out the demos
7186000	7188000	Buy the full game
7190000	7192000	What are the huge Indie Games
7192000	7194000	That I should be playing? Do we know of any?
7194000	7196000	Cause I tried a couple and
7196000	7198000	I gotta admit, nothing that really
7198000	7200000	Nothing that really made me want to come on the show and talk about it
7200000	7202000	Haven't you played Carnivale?
7202000	7204000	I haven't
7204000	7206000	I was looking at that Breath of Death
7206000	7208000	Whatever though, I was gonna download that
7208000	7210000	I just didn't get around to it
7210000	7212000	I think that's what it was called
7212000	7214000	It was one of the first Indie Games I picked up
7214000	7216000	And it's awesome
7216000	7218000	So good
7218000	7220000	It's kind of a game where you launch
7220000	7222000	This clown rag doll
7222000	7224000	Thing into the area
7224000	7226000	And you collect balloons and stuff
7226000	7228000	But it's
7228000	7230000	Really
7230000	7232000	Kinda cool
7232000	7234000	I just like the art style in it and everything
7234000	7236000	But yeah, Carnivale
7236000	7238000	I'm trying to think of some other ones
7238000	7240000	That are actually pretty cool
7240000	7242000	There
7242000	7244000	There was one, oh god, what the hell was that?
7244000	7246000	There was one
7246000	7248000	It was
7248000	7250000	It was some sort of
7250000	7252000	Obama
7252000	7254000	Fighting game or something like that
7254000	7256000	Oh dear
7256000	7258000	What the hell was it?
7258000	7260000	It was something ridiculous
7260000	7262000	It was some dude that
7262000	7264000	Was
7264000	7266000	Running around and there would be people
7266000	7268000	Trying to attack you and you can
7268000	7270000	Pick up a bus and smash them with the bus
7270000	7272000	Oh, you showed me
7272000	7274000	Videos of that, I remember
7274000	7276000	It looked like bad dudes or something
7276000	7278000	It was pretty funny
7278000	7280000	Are you a bad enough dude to be the president?
7280000	7282000	Nice
7282000	7284000	Alright, well you think of some others
7284000	7286000	I don't know, I haven't really been on Indie Games
7286000	7288000	In a while, so
7288000	7290000	You'll have to remedy that soon, alright
7290000	7292000	Well anyway, let's talk about
7292000	7294000	This is definitely not about Indie Games
7294000	7296000	It's about games that people are looking forward to
7296000	7298000	Next year, the Nintendo 3DS
7298000	7300000	Is a huge, huge thing of course
7300000	7302000	It's going to be about 2011
7302000	7304000	Because everything has to be in 3D in this day and age
7304000	7306000	So the 3DS is getting a big
7306000	7308000	Public showing in February
7308000	7310000	In Japan
7310000	7312000	3DS will also be at the World Hobby Fair
7312000	7314000	It's going to be at some Japanese shopping centers
7314000	7316000	Crazy, crazy
7316000	7318000	Excuse me, crazy stuff
7318000	7320000	But here's some of the games
7320000	7322000	That are going to be playable
7322000	7324000	At this exhibition
7324000	7326000	Nintendo World 2011
7326000	7328000	The new Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D
7328000	7330000	Pro Evolution 3D Soccer
7330000	7332000	Street Fighter IV 3D
7332000	7334000	Resident Evil Revelations
7334000	7336000	Dynasty Warriors Chronicle
7336000	7338000	Dead or Alive Dimensions
7338000	7340000	Oh man, Dead or Alive Dimensions
7340000	7342000	Imagine those titties bouncing in full 3D
7342000	7344000	It's going to be amazing
7344000	7346000	Ridge Racer 3D
7346000	7348000	Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle
7348000	7350000	Nintendogs plus Cats
7350000	7352000	Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D
7352000	7354000	Steel Diver Pilotwings Resort
7354000	7356000	AR Games and the Nintendo 3DS
7356000	7358000	Camera
7358000	7360000	Now there's some other stuff that is not playable that's going to be shown
7360000	7362000	Kingdom Hearts 3D
7362000	7364000	Super Monkey Ball 3D
7364000	7366000	Puzzle Bobble 3D
7366000	7368000	Star Fox 64
7368000	7370000	Animal Crossing Mario Kart
7370000	7372000	So on and so on
7372000	7374000	Probably the same shit we saw at E3
7374000	7376000	But maybe with a new coat of paint
7376000	7378000	I don't know
7378000	7380000	By the way, most people are predicting it will be $2.99
7380000	7382000	I'm going to say
7382000	7384000	I agree with that, $2.99
7384000	7386000	and the Zelda Ocarina of Time is the pack-in
7386000	7388000	Because it's a huge
7388000	7390000	game without being
7390000	7392000	a lot of money
7392000	7394000	spent by Nintendo, you know what I mean?
7394000	7396000	I think that will be the pack-in game
7396000	7398000	The camera, the Zelda Ocarina of Time
7398000	7400000	3D, maybe some samplers
7400000	7402000	with some of these other trailers and so stuff
7402000	7404000	Other stuff, but it won't be Kid Icarus
7404000	7406000	I'll tell you that, that will not be the pack-in game
7406000	7408000	Alright
7408000	7410000	And that's just
7410000	7412000	I have nothing to go off of
7412000	7414000	Just what I think
7414000	7416000	Let's get to what you think in the mailbag
7416000	7418000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7418000	7420000	is a place to send your emails every week
7420000	7422000	Dark Soccer will dive in the mailbag
7422000	7424000	and pick some of her favorite emails
7424000	7426000	and read them for us here on the air
7426000	7428000	I will
7428000	7430000	But I think the holidays slowed people down, didn't it?
7430000	7432000	Yep
7432000	7434000	This one, the OLR 2010 Predictions Forum thread
7434000	7436000	We got next to nothing
7436000	7438000	and mine were all wrong
7438000	7440000	but thankfully so
7440000	7442000	I won't be posting
7442000	7444000	a 2011 thread this year
7444000	7446000	I would like to mention a heavily self-biased list
7446000	7448000	of some notable things that happened
7448000	7450000	Don't include the stuff if it was part of your year-end wrap-ups
7450000	7452000	I'm gonna do it anyway
7452000	7454000	Well, we didn't even end up doing your year-end wrap-ups, so there you go
7454000	7456000	2010 Slimeball Award
7456000	7458000	Activision
7458000	7460000	Dismantling of Infinity Ward was
7460000	7462000	so as not to pay bonuses
7462000	7464000	for a job while being gamefully employed
7464000	7466000	is not a reason to fire them
7466000	7468000	In fact, the games industry
7468000	7470000	will be best served
7470000	7472000	if you encourage career development across companies
7472000	7474000	The decision was very profit-oriented
7474000	7476000	and slimy
7476000	7478000	One thing I hope the developer studios should have learned
7478000	7480000	is to put in their contracts
7480000	7482000	that bonuses are paid
7482000	7484000	based on project, not employment
7484000	7486000	2010 Last to the Party Award
7486000	7488000	Me! I joined Facebook in August
7488000	7490000	2010
7490000	7492000	Developer of the Year, PopCap
7492000	7494000	Their games are not hard-hitting, but they sure are fun
7494000	7496000	PopCap is really good at breathing new life
7496000	7498000	into old games, plant versus zombies on new systems
7498000	7500000	with new features, Bejeweled 3,
7500000	7502000	Zuma's Revenge, and Zuma Blitz
7502000	7504000	2010 Welcome to the 21st Century Award
7504000	7506000	Steam
7506000	7508000	Steam made no-box direct sales of software
7508000	7510000	worth it with their great prices
7510000	7512000	Think you shouldn't pay as much for a game
7512000	7514000	because the cost of packaging and media isn't an issue?
7514000	7516000	Steam understands that
7516000	7518000	The newest games are pricey, but their sales
7518000	7520000	on right now make it affordable
7520000	7522000	2010 Best Use of Meat
7522000	7524000	in a Game's Title, Super Meat Boy
7524000	7526000	They managed to use the initials SMB
7526000	7528000	to hilarious effects
7528000	7530000	I'm looking forward to what you guys come up with
7530000	7532000	Ra-ba-buh
7532000	7534000	Ba-bom
7534000	7536000	That's cute
7536000	7538000	Last one
7538000	7540000	Dear Peoples of the Intertubes
7540000	7542000	You put out the call on Twitter for gaming-related
7542000	7544000	New Year's resolutions. Well, most of my resolutions
7544000	7546000	have to do with writing
7546000	7548000	My only vaguely gaming-related one
7548000	7550000	is to pay off my credit card, which I've
7550000	7552000	only used to buy my two-year-old
7552000	7554000	laptop. Besides, I don't make
7554000	7556000	resolutions as much as I make goals. Goals
7556000	7558000	tend not to have an expiration date that leads to
7558000	7560000	disappointment in yourself. Stay black, redertainment
7560000	7562000	This message was brought to you by
7562000	7564000	Windows 7, which totally fucked up my
7564000	7566000	two-year-old laptop, sent for my iPad
7566000	7570000	Well, you gotta have the money to buy the games, so
7570000	7574000	Ah, good ol' reliable iPad
7574000	7576000	And if you pay off your credit card, you can always
7576000	7578000	run it all up again. Just kidding
7578000	7580000	You know what I have noticed? Don't look too crazy. What?
7580000	7582000	I have better luck sending emails from my iPhone
7582000	7584000	than I do my PC sometimes. Really?
7584000	7586000	Because my iPhone has never crashed on me
7586000	7590000	Alright, well let's get to the FUs of the week
7590000	7592000	I've had iPhone apps crash on me
7592000	7594000	just so you know. I've had apps crash
7594000	7596000	but there's no such thing as a BSOD
7596000	7598000	on an iPhone. Yet
7598000	7600000	But there is a such thing as the
7600000	7602000	alarms suddenly not working on the iPhone
7602000	7604000	I don't know if you heard about that
7604000	7606000	It's not a perfect world
7606000	7608000	Let's get to the FUs of the week
7622000	7626000	FU to my back and now my butt
7626000	7630000	Because I was playing with my friend's son
7630000	7632000	and he's heavy
7632000	7634000	and I've wrenched my lower back
7634000	7636000	and it's since settled in my right side
7636000	7638000	I have a bad hip for the record
7638000	7640000	I've been in two car accidents
7640000	7642000	and injured my hip both times
7642000	7644000	and I'm in a lot of pain
7644000	7646000	I've taken significant Vicodin today
7646000	7650000	significant, I won't say how much
7650000	7652000	and um, I still hurt
7652000	7654000	I'm walking around like I'm, you know, 90
7654000	7656000	and I don't like it
7656000	7660000	Also, I FU'd to the tail end of this cold that refused to go away
7660000	7664000	which makes me very antisocial and bitchy
7668000	7670000	Is that all?
7670000	7672000	Okay, Loki
7672000	7674000	What's your FUs of the week, Loki?
7674000	7676000	My FU of the week would be to
7676000	7678000	I don't know, the weather
7678000	7680000	sucks
7680000	7682000	I don't really have anything
7682000	7684000	Uh, Gary
7684000	7686000	Do you have any FUs of the week?
7686000	7688000	Things that are making you mad?
7688000	7690000	I would have to
7690000	7692000	agree with Loki on that one
7692000	7694000	the weather around here has blown goats
7694000	7696000	all days yesterday and today
7696000	7698000	I hate rain
7698000	7700000	but I've said that before
7700000	7702000	I mean, other people will remind me
7702000	7704000	that yes, we need it
7704000	7706000	but still, it makes everything
7706000	7708000	especially driving more difficult
7708000	7710000	and
7710000	7712000	yeah, that's the only one I want to say right now
7712000	7714000	It can rain up in the hills
7714000	7716000	and trickle down here
7716000	7718000	Well, it can rain, yeah, it can rain at night
7718000	7720000	when I actually don't have to drive
7720000	7722000	but, oh well, whatever, that's life
7722000	7724000	I don't think the environment cares if you're driving or not
7724000	7726000	I'm pretty sure it doesn't
7726000	7728000	but I'm still frustrated all the same
7728000	7730000	Um, I would say
7730000	7732000	FU to
7732000	7734000	Comcast!
7734000	7736000	My internet provider
7736000	7738000	Comcast is evil
7738000	7740000	My internet is still dropping out
7740000	7742000	I came out to my house last week
7742000	7744000	to try to fix it
7744000	7746000	and I'm still getting
7746000	7748000	randomly dropped from the internet
7748000	7750000	which is affecting my Warcraft playing
7750000	7752000	Sorry, you know
7752000	7754000	Jamie and I have a mutual friend who has Comcast
7754000	7756000	and she's always complaining about issues with it
7756000	7758000	so I can feel your pain on that one
7758000	7760000	Hey, at least the tech who came to my house
7760000	7762000	was really nice, but I kind of got the sense
7762000	7764000	in just what he was saying that
7764000	7766000	yeah, this seems to be a problem in Comcast's office
7766000	7768000	and I'm just really here to validate that there's a problem
7768000	7770000	You know, like
7770000	7772000	so frustrating
7772000	7774000	At least nobody came into your neighborhood and snapped the main
7774000	7776000	fiber optic cable
7776000	7778000	You remember when that happened to me?
7778000	7780000	Well that's not Comcast though, that's just some jackass
7780000	7782000	That's some asshole
7782000	7784000	But anyhow, that's it for my FUs of the Week
7784000	7786000	Just FU to the fact I can't run instances
7786000	7788000	and wow, because I always get disconnected
7788000	7790000	Rude and ignorant
7790000	7792000	Couple more news stories for you guys
7792000	7794000	and then the Skype line 877-GAME-OLR
7794000	7796000	but not just yet, we got two more stories for you
7796000	7798000	Mikey?
7798000	7800000	Yes, so
7800000	7802000	to kind of wrap things up
7802000	7804000	and this is surprising, thank God
7804000	7806000	I haven't run across it probably because it's in a different region
7806000	7808000	but Android
7808000	7810000	the marketplace is getting a few games
7810000	7812000	that are actually Trojan horses
7812000	7814000	that are letting
7814000	7816000	I guess malicious hackers
7816000	7818000	possibly use your phone as part of
7818000	7820000	a botnet
7820000	7822000	Apparently in China
7822000	7824000	on their app store, there's
7824000	7826000	I guess a few apps that are affected
7826000	7828000	by this. Monkey Jump 2
7828000	7830000	Sex Positions
7830000	7832000	President vs. Aliens
7832000	7834000	and
7834000	7836000	City Defense and
7836000	7838000	Baseball Superstars 2010
7838000	7840000	It says they found
7840000	7842000	these only right now on the Chinese app store
7842000	7844000	but they're saying that
7844000	7846000	it's possible that these may be coming
7846000	7848000	to the other regions
7848000	7850000	to just be on the lookout for them
7850000	7852000	It says
7852000	7854000	Although the intent of this Trojan isn't entirely clear
7854000	7856000	the possibilities range from setting up
7856000	7858000	a malicious mobile ad network
7858000	7860000	to creating an Android botnet
7860000	7862000	They said that
7862000	7864000	they're just kind of
7864000	7866000	watching out. It says possibly affected apps
7866000	7868000	could be posted to the app stores
7868000	7870000	targeting US users
7870000	7872000	in the future
7872000	7874000	so just
7874000	7876000	be on the lookout
7876000	7878000	I worry about
7878000	7880000	the day something like this happens to the iPhone
7880000	7882000	I mean Android's bad enough, there's enough people to use that
7882000	7884000	but boy oh boy when something like this
7884000	7886000	happens on iTunes
7886000	7888000	That's true
7888000	7890000	I mean everything does have to go through that rigid
7890000	7892000	approval process with Apple
7892000	7894000	but you just wonder when something's gonna slip through the cracks
7894000	7896000	It will eventually
7896000	7898000	Of course they can always pull it
7898000	7900000	once it gets out there
7900000	7902000	I heard about that
7902000	7904000	What was the one
7904000	7906000	something about baby
7906000	7908000	oh it was really bad, it was something like
7908000	7910000	punching babies or something and somehow it got approved
7910000	7912000	it was really terrible
7912000	7914000	Well some of you might feel a little terrible
7914000	7916000	about this and it's always interesting
7916000	7918000	to report on these type of like ROM
7918000	7920000	types of stories but there's a part of me that sits here
7920000	7922000	and goes okay seriously y'all this game
7922000	7924000	is like 20 plus years old
7924000	7926000	so let's talk about The Legend of Zelda
7926000	7928000	on the Famicom
7928000	7930000	or the Nintendo if you will
7930000	7932000	You know when it came out on the Famicom
7932000	7934000	it was actually a disc game
7934000	7936000	and we didn't have it here in the US but some of the games
7936000	7938000	for the original Japanese version
7938000	7940000	of the Nintendo ran on the
7940000	7942000	Famicom disc system
7942000	7944000	so they were like these little floppies
7944000	7946000	Well this week or I should say
7946000	7948000	over the holiday at least it did come to light that there was
7948000	7950000	a prototype of The Legend of Zelda
7950000	7952000	on one of these discs
7952000	7954000	so it was found and promptly uploaded
7954000	7956000	to the internet and you can check this out for yourself
7956000	7958000	it's a prototype of The Legend of Zelda
7958000	7960000	Here's the thing though guys
7960000	7962000	honestly when I kind of heard about this I was like oh that's neat
7962000	7964000	that there's a prototype out there for such a big game
7964000	7966000	but not that much changed
7966000	7968000	they changed some sprites
7968000	7970000	slightly
7970000	7972000	it's almost unnoticeable
7972000	7974000	how they changed some of these sprites
7974000	7976000	like some of the guys that bounce around
7976000	7978000	didn't have whiskers before and they do now
7978000	7980000	I mean there's really little stuff
7980000	7982000	very very minor floor plans
7982000	7984000	some reconfigurations
7984000	7986000	but of course if you're a hardcore Legend of Zelda fan
7986000	7988000	and if you grew up with this game
7988000	7990000	it's kind of neat to see what once was
7990000	7992000	so
7992000	7994000	what's that? I'm downloading it
7994000	7996000	of course you are
7996000	7998000	it is available on this website
7998000	8000000	called let's see
8000000	8002000	it was originally put on this forums
8002000	8004000	at lostlevels.org
8004000	8006000	which I think gets into a lot of these types of
8006000	8008000	prototype issues
8008000	8010000	and I guess there's more information available as well
8010000	8012000	on a website called the Cutting Room Floor
8012000	8014000	TCRF.net
8014000	8016000	which is a whole little like Wikipedia
8016000	8018000	type thing that will detail all of the changes
8018000	8020000	if you really want to know what rooms
8020000	8022000	led different rooms and how the item
8022000	8024000	drops were different. I mean they get into
8024000	8026000	the real nitty gritty about
8026000	8028000	this. Most people will just kind of go
8028000	8030000	eh, neat, couple things are different
8030000	8032000	so
8032000	8034000	you know again if you're going to download stuff like this
8034000	8036000	though you should consider you know at least owning
8036000	8038000	a legitimate copy of this be it through
8038000	8040000	Virtual Console or one of the
8040000	8042000	50,000 times Nintendo has released this
8042000	8044000	games be it in compilations or what
8044000	8046000	have you
8046000	8048000	but I say you know what
8048000	8050000	if as long as you have one of those
8050000	8052000	other games or you've had at some point in your life
8052000	8054000	I think you're entitled to take a peek at this
8054000	8056000	game.
8056000	8058000	Alright that is it for the
8058000	8060000	news tonight. We're going to open up the
8060000	8062000	Skype line. Woohoo! Let's get some calls
8062000	8064000	877-GAME-OLR or
8064000	8066000	our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
8066000	8068000	first calls of 2011 before
8068000	8070000	the delay is bigger tonight
8070000	8072000	so it's about a minute so do we have any
8072000	8074000	last minute stories while we wait for some calls to come in?
8074000	8076000	No but I was going to talk you were
8076000	8078000	asking about games that are good on the
8078000	8080000	marketplace and I was just pulling up some
8080000	8082000	that I thought might have been pretty good
8082000	8084000	one that I was really addicted
8084000	8086000	to Minor Dig Deep
8086000	8088000	was a really good one on the indie marketplace
8088000	8090000	and it's only a buck
8090000	8092000	this one looked kind of funny
8092000	8094000	Try Not To Fart
8096000	8098000	It looked awful. I saw the box art
8098000	8100000	for that like how exactly
8100000	8102000	do you not fart? I don't I think
8102000	8104000	it's button presses you have to mimic the button
8104000	8106000	presses but they have like you know
8106000	8108000	like different situations eating dinner
8108000	8110000	with like your girlfriend's parents
8110000	8112000	or you know wedding
8112000	8114000	I remembered one of the indie games
8114000	8116000	that I played that was really really bad
8116000	8118000	it was called Maids With Balloons
8118000	8120000	Oh I saw that! And it's
8120000	8122000	it actually has like live motion
8122000	8124000	video in it that they actually shot
8124000	8126000	like in some guy's spare bedroom and it starts
8126000	8128000	to look like a really really
8128000	8130000	bad homemade porno with
8130000	8132000	these three chicks and in
8132000	8134000	made costumes that really need to be dry cleaned
8134000	8136000	like just you know
8136000	8138000	like trying to be all like sexy and
8138000	8140000	so forth and
8140000	8142000	wow it was
8142000	8144000	it was kind of poop. Like I hate to
8144000	8146000	you know I know we're supposed to support indie
8146000	8148000	games and all that stuff but it's very
8148000	8150000	clear what this game is all about and it's
8150000	8152000	not the game. Sounds like epic fail
8152000	8154000	Yeah Insiders
8154000	8156000	Incite Lacrosse's college
8156000	8158000	was it College Lacrosse 2010?
8158000	8160000	That's a good one. Alright
8160000	8162000	let's get to the call. Hi you're on Orange
8162000	8164000	Laundry Radio who's this?
8164000	8166000	It's Ron and yes SSJ 100
8166000	8168000	Matt is correct I am the first one
8168000	8170000	of the year. You're the
8170000	8172000	first one of every goddamn show but you know what
8172000	8174000	here's what I say if you don't like Rama getting through
8174000	8176000	first every time they have Skype
8176000	8178000	on the iPhone you know
8178000	8180000	you can call us at Orange Laundry Radio we have a toll free number
8180000	8182000	for heaven's sakes there's plenty of ways
8182000	8184000	to get through to the show so if
8184000	8186000	you're the only one that wants to have your voice be heard
8186000	8188000	then so be it. What's on your mind tonight?
8188000	8190000	That and there are weeks when I let people
8190000	8192000	jump the line I don't even bother but
8192000	8194000	a couple of things
8194000	8196000	I'll be on my merry little way
8196000	8198000	now this whole court case
8198000	8200000	with the whole NFL thing I'm hoping
8200000	8202000	that the judge nullifies the contract
8202000	8204000	because damn it I want my tech mobile
8204000	8206000	NFL teams
8208000	8210000	Ah that would be nice you know I think
8210000	8212000	competition is sometimes a little bit healthy
8212000	8214000	you know what really frustrates me to no end about this
8214000	8216000	whole Comcast stuff is that
8216000	8218000	there's no real competition
8218000	8220000	in this area I mean I guess
8220000	8222000	we're starting to see more and more AT&T
8222000	8224000	U-verse and some people would tell
8224000	8226000	me oh well there's DSL and I'm
8226000	8228000	actually getting to the point where I don't care if
8228000	8230000	DSL is like a fourth as fast as
8230000	8232000	cable I'm gonna fucking switch
8232000	8234000	if they can't figure this problem out
8234000	8236000	you know what I mean? I hear you
8236000	8238000	DSL isn't as fast but it's just more
8238000	8240000	dependable more reliable I mean
8240000	8242000	that's part of the reason why I switched to fiber optic
8242000	8244000	I mean yeah I got I had
8244000	8246000	cable but you know what when the cable
8246000	8248000	modem goes out at 12
8248000	8250000	midnight during off peak hours
8250000	8252000	for 5-10 minutes at a time
8252000	8254000	I'm switching to something else
8254000	8256000	that's a lot better and besides
8256000	8258000	FiOS TV
8258000	8260000	pictures a lot sharper and a lot
8260000	8262000	cleaner than what cable vision was offering
8262000	8264000	I don't even really watch TV it's all about Netflix
8264000	8266000	and all that now but you know you live in New York
8266000	8268000	City too where you probably have more options
8268000	8270000	see being here in Sacramento
8270000	8272000	it's not that Sacramento doesn't have like you know
8272000	8274000	it's not like we're a potent town or one of the
8274000	8276000	I think what we're number 20 in the nation
8276000	8278000	or something like that but I live a little bit
8278000	8280000	on the outskirts of Sacramento so
8280000	8282000	I don't think I have as many options where I live
8282000	8284000	I hear where you're coming from
8284000	8286000	because where I am my options are either cable
8286000	8288000	vision or Verizon
8288000	8290000	you go in certain parts of New York City it's
8290000	8292000	either Time Warner or Verizon
8292000	8294000	and sometimes it's RCN or AT&T
8294000	8296000	it depends on where you go
8296000	8298000	big wang eater in our chat room is saying
8298000	8300000	fucking switch, switch bitch
8300000	8302000	I will switch to eating
8302000	8304000	big wang that's why I will switch to
8304000	8306000	how long ago did you switch to that?
8306000	8308000	you opened the door
8308000	8310000	I plead the fifth
8310000	8312000	I plead the fifth
8312000	8314000	well going back to the DSL
8314000	8316000	part of the reason the DSL is better than
8316000	8318000	cable is because with cable you're sharing bandwidth
8318000	8320000	with everyone on your block whereas
8320000	8322000	DSL just everyone in your house
8322000	8324000	it's a slightly more manageable situation
8324000	8326000	but yeah plus DSL
8326000	8328000	speeds are getting up to where they can compete
8328000	8330000	with cable's fastest speeds
8330000	8332000	first question I'm going to ask the DSL people is
8332000	8334000	can I play WoW on it?
8334000	8336000	that's all I want
8336000	8338000	and even with DSL speeds coming up
8338000	8340000	you have to pay more for it
8340000	8342000	but let's get back to gaming talk
8342000	8344000	yeah sorry
8344000	8346000	well hey it directly affects my games
8346000	8348000	it's not just WoW
8348000	8350000	it's Playstation Network and this whole
8350000	8352000	White Knight Chronicles being online enabled
8352000	8354000	I can't keep a connection
8354000	8356000	it's getting bad
8356000	8358000	anyhow
8358000	8360000	so what else is on your mind my friend anything else?
8360000	8362000	Arcade Infinity
8362000	8364000	now before we get into that
8364000	8366000	just so you know
8366000	8368000	Colt 45
8368000	8370000	is a malt liquor not a beer
8370000	8372000	so if you're going to pour a 40
8372000	8374000	you're pouring a 40 of malt liquor
8374000	8376000	you don't pour beer
8376000	8378000	beer is tasty malt liquor
8378000	8380000	not so much
8380000	8382000	that's why I said
8382000	8384000	an ice cold Colt
8384000	8386000	can is the same to me unless it's Guinness
8386000	8388000	but Guinness is better out of a bottle truth
8388000	8390000	true that true that
8390000	8392000	even better on tap
8392000	8394000	that's true more truth
8394000	8396000	so alrighty
8396000	8398000	Rama I'm going to go ahead and let you go
8398000	8400000	but wait actually one more question

8466000	8468000	shoot one up
8468000	8470000	that's supposed to be a really good one
8470000	8472000	and that's pretty
8472000	8474000	cheap explosion aid
8474000	8476000	was another good one that was by the guys that did
8476000	8478000	weapon of choice and really
8478000	8480000	cool looking shooter game here comes a call
8480000	8482000	hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this
8482000	8484000	legend nazaku here hello my friend
8484000	8486000	how are you doing
8486000	8488000	doing pretty good what's on your mind buddy
8488000	8490000	nah I know
8490000	8492000	adam mentioned arcade infinity you probably already
8492000	8494000	covered this to death but
8494000	8496000	the way I see it is that
8496000	8498000	I'm surprised it managed to go this
8498000	8500000	long given
8500000	8502000	the fact that you know round
8502000	8504000	one pretty much was there
8504000	8506000	pretty much was the
8506000	8508000	was a death blow to them
8508000	8510000	and don't get me don't get me wrong with
8510000	8512000	round one at least they're like an authentic
8512000	8514000	japanese entertainment center to an
8514000	8516000	extent and they're
8516000	8518000	they do a lot better than d&b but
8518000	8520000	I don't know it's like the arcades are
8520000	8522000	pretty much dead at this point I hate
8522000	8524000	to say it they're dead they're just not
8524000	8526000	dying they're they're pretty much dead
8526000	8528000	it's funny you bring up d&b
8528000	8530000	because I was at dave and busters this week
8530000	8532000	and it's still it's still kicking there's still quite a
8532000	8534000	lot of corporate owned I'm
8534000	8536000	talking about like mom and pop
8536000	8538000	operations like arcade infinity
8538000	8540000	I gotcha
8540000	8542000	like those on their way out
8542000	8544000	the rest of them are pretty much on death row
8544000	8546000	unless of course you're in
8546000	8548000	you know you have foot traffic but
8548000	8550000	yeah it's a disaster state of affairs now
8550000	8552000	it just
8552000	8554000	you know it doesn't make sense when
8554000	8556000	you know
8556000	8558000	I get
8558000	8560000	the way no I get what you're
8560000	8562000	saying you know sadly it's one of those things where you know
8562000	8564000	yeah we covered the story here and it was kind of one
8564000	8566000	of those oh that's kind of
8566000	8568000	sad but it's also not surprising
8568000	8570000	I mean that's just you're right arcades
8570000	8572000	have been kind of going this way and there's
8572000	8574000	there's not been a lot that's really made us
8574000	8576000	have to go oh we've got to go to the arcade and have
8576000	8578000	that experience because now we have
8578000	8580000	the internet you know and
8580000	8582000	even it's it's so weird
8582000	8584000	because OLR started because
8584000	8586000	of arcade culture and
8586000	8588000	that couldn't happen today
8588000	8590000	and it's kind of sad
8590000	8592000	in a way but even our little
8592000	8594000	arcade culture has moved to the internet
8594000	8596000	in its own little way and it's not
8596000	8598000	like the internet didn't exist then because we used to have
8598000	8600000	our own little forums the sacramentals
8600000	8602000	were our little DDR team and so
8602000	8604000	forth which wasn't really a team it was just you know
8604000	8606000	kids that played DDR but
8606000	8608000	you know it wasn't
8608000	8610000	like what we have now with
8610000	8612000	Xbox Live I would
8612000	8614000	go so far as to say things like Xbox Live and
8614000	8616000	MMOs that's what really killed the arcade
8616000	8618000	right but then
8618000	8620000	again I've been hearing it
8620000	8622000	from other arcade owners that I know
8622000	8624000	that you know it's a dying industry
8624000	8626000	it's pretty much
8626000	8628000	on its days are pretty much numbered
8628000	8630000	and I know that I mean
8630000	8632000	somebody has to innovate somewhere
8632000	8634000	and of course I don't know what that answer is
8634000	8636000	or I'd be a freaking millionaire but
8636000	8638000	surely there is something where people
8638000	8640000	would want to do it in person you know what I mean
8640000	8642000	there's got to be something that will
8642000	8644000	get people I always want to do it in person
8644000	8646000	it's just you know
8646000	8648000	what I mean the folks who run
8648000	8650000	the classic arcades they're probably going to be
8650000	8652000	around for a while as long as that
8652000	8654000	as long as that generation of
8654000	8656000	folks who used to play those types
8656000	8658000	of older games even the newer ones
8658000	8660000	they'll still
8660000	8662000	be a place for those types of arcades
8662000	8664000	even ours even a place like
8664000	8666000	AI someone will
8666000	8668000	someone will step up eventually
8668000	8670000	and just you know pick up the torch
8670000	8672000	where they left off as well you know
8672000	8674000	as long as they're right as long as
8674000	8676000	they're like running a tight
8676000	8678000	ship I gotta say this
8678000	8680000	I gotta say this though too I mean let's be
8680000	8682000	real AI also
8682000	8684000	it was in kind of a shitty location
8684000	8686000	right round one it didn't
8686000	8688000	really have a lot of advertising
8688000	8690000	and I realized it was an independent thing but
8690000	8692000	unless you were kind of on the internet
8692000	8694000	I had no idea about this place
8694000	8696000	until I was like online and
8696000	8698000	posting on DDR boards
8698000	8700000	it's not even that I heard they were getting
8700000	8702000	flack from the city like they were
8702000	8704000	they were like really hesitant about
8704000	8706000	renewing their licenses wow
8706000	8708000	sad right and not a couple with
8708000	8710000	the fact that their landlord
8710000	8712000	you know raised their rent
8712000	8714000	constantly you know
8714000	8716000	raised their rent to the point where they were
8716000	8718000	gonna they had no choice but to be driven
8718000	8720000	out that you know and then round one
8720000	8722000	showed up so it was like so
8722000	8724000	many forces and the
8724000	8726000	they pretty much were
8726000	8728000	there were so many
8728000	8730000	aspects responsible for their demise
8730000	8732000	and it's like I don't
8732000	8734000	want to like clog up this precious Skype
8734000	8736000	time just debating it if you look on
8736000	8738000	those forums the fighting game forums
8738000	8740000	even your Bobani forums
8740000	8742000	you'll find the answers from people
8742000	8744000	who actually who have
8744000	8746000	more deeper knowledge than I do
8746000	8748000	that's what I hear let me ask you I've been asking
8748000	8750000	everybody else tends to wrap up and get more calls
8750000	8752000	what was your favorite game of all last
8752000	8754000	year any criteria you want uh
8754000	8756000	let me see
8756000	8758000	any criteria would that
8758000	8760000	be I'm thinking
8760000	8762000	I'm thinking bad company too
8762000	8764000	why is that because I think
8764000	8766000	just because of its crack like addictions like
8766000	8768000	especially the multiplayer
8768000	8770000	where it's all even though it's
8770000	8772000	team based it's just like on the PC
8772000	8774000	there's no ass hattery there's
8774000	8776000	like everyone helps everyone
8776000	8778000	fights no one quits
8778000	8780000	I wish there could be less ass
8780000	8782000	hattery in online games that is
8782000	8784000	one thing I would say Red Dead Redemption
8784000	8786000	but I just started that game a few days ago
8786000	8788000	that is one thing I will say that arcades
8788000	8790000	always kind of have over
8790000	8792000	uh the uh
8792000	8794000	online stuff is that online
8794000	8796000	you can hide behind your monitor but in
8796000	8798000	arcades if you're gonna be an asshole you have to be an
8798000	8800000	asshole to people's faces
8800000	8802000	that's one thing I do this at arcades
8802000	8804000	alright Zaku I gotta let you go so we can get more calls
8804000	8806000	have a good one buddy
8834000	8836000	I have a podcast where they discuss
8836000	8838000	the game but I haven't heard any of their shows
8838000	8840000	yet because I don't want to download iTunes
8840000	8842000	but um yeah I think yeah I've heard something like
8842000	8844000	that and uh my game of the decade is
8844000	8846000	Grand Theft Auto IV I think
8846000	8848000	that's just one of the best games ever made
8848000	8850000	in my opinion I don't
8850000	8852000	understand where all the hate for it came
8852000	8854000	from you know
8854000	8856000	no Loki would be right there with you buddy
8856000	8858000	Loki Grand Theft Auto IV game of the decade
8858000	8860000	possibly maybe
8860000	8862000	um it's pretty good
8862000	8864000	I don't know if I
8864000	8866000	yeah you had people complaining about the water
8866000	8868000	I think that was some of the best
8868000	8870000	computer generated water I've ever
8870000	8872000	slammed into the game and I can't believe people even
8872000	8874000	hated that I don't know it's just a weird
8874000	8876000	hate for that game I think when that's
8876000	8878000	like if you're complaining about the water
8878000	8880000	above everything else like really
8880000	8882000	that's kind of a stretch you know
8882000	8884000	I can think of games that have many more problems
8884000	8886000	than the water yeah they complain
8886000	8888000	about the water and the driving just because you couldn't
8888000	8890000	just you couldn't speed down uh
8890000	8892000	down the street at like 200
8892000	8894000	miles a minute you know
8894000	8896000	without uh you know they claim that
8896000	8898000	that was also a problem with the game I don't know I love the game
8898000	8900000	but anyway uh what else I want to get
8900000	8902000	to is arcades you asked about innovation
8902000	8904000	yeah and I think that uh
8904000	8906000	the way they'll probably be able
8906000	8908000	to save it is uh virtual reality
8908000	8910000	like some type of
8910000	8912000	apparatus that I know they already have something like that
8912000	8914000	but they need something where you'll have a
8914000	8916000	group of people that'll stand in it and there'll be some type of
8916000	8918000	multiplayer aspect I think that multiplayer
8918000	8920000	to the arcade will actually
8920000	8922000	be something that might be able to save it
8922000	8924000	so the holodeck
8924000	8926000	yeah yeah pretty much yeah the holodeck
8926000	8928000	that'll save
8928000	8930000	the arcades I think or maybe even
8930000	8932000	motion control I don't know
8932000	8934000	I find it kind of fascinating in a way that you're
8934000	8936000	calling in to talk about saving arcades and you
8936000	8938000	also kind of in the same sentence say
8938000	8940000	mag is the best game that you played last year
8940000	8942000	mag is very interesting
8942000	8944000	because it's it's
8944000	8946000	not an MMO
8946000	8948000	you can't really call it just some multiplayer online
8948000	8950000	game either it's like a
8950000	8952000	it's just it's a brawl
8952000	8954000	you know what I mean
8954000	8956000	yeah it's really great I mean
8956000	8958000	I think as far as
8958000	8960000	first person shooters go
8960000	8962000	that's the main reason why I like mag was just because
8962000	8964000	it was very innovative they were doing something
8964000	8966000	that you're not seeing in call of duty
8966000	8968000	that you're not even seeing in halo
8968000	8970000	and you know I just can't believe
8970000	8972000	how people just
8972000	8974000	knock any type of new innovation that comes out of
8974000	8976000	you know if the first person shooter is not call of
8976000	8978000	duty they knock it down
8978000	8980000	and you know
8980000	8982000	you know if the game is in
8982000	8984000	well what's the other big game that they
8984000	8986000	have out there that
8986000	8988000	people seen the
8988000	8990000	halo I'm drawing a blank
8990000	8992000	oh wow there you go yeah
8992000	8994000	if it's not wow it also gets shot down black ops
8994000	8996000	it's like you could only
8996000	8998000	yeah it's like you could only make those two games it's like you can only
8998000	9000000	make call of duty for shooters and you
9000000	9002000	could only make wow for
9002000	9004000	MMOs you know it's like the only
9004000	9006000	two games in existence in people's minds
9006000	9008000	I mean don't
9008000	9010000	get me wrong I like wow I think wow is great
9010000	9012000	but I've also played other MMOs
9012000	9014000	and I think you know they should also get
9014000	9016000	a chance you know I think they're
9016000	9018000	great games do you think there's a way
9018000	9020000	I'm just a gamer period do you think
9020000	9022000	there's a way to bring the magic of
9022000	9024000	mag and what makes that game exciting for you
9024000	9026000	to an arcade or do you think that
9026000	9028000	that 64 player brawl
9028000	9030000	experience is something you can really only do
9030000	9032000	online and only ever do online
9032000	9034000	I don't know you can bring something like
9034000	9036000	mag to an arcade
9036000	9038000	you couldn't have 128 people
9038000	9040000	versus 128 people but
9040000	9042000	you know you could probably have like a little
9042000	9044000	skirmish of like maybe
9044000	9046000	four people versus another four
9046000	9048000	people almost like a laser tag
9048000	9050000	you know what it could be
9050000	9052000	you could still use the internet in it
9052000	9054000	but it could be like city versus city
9054000	9056000	or something like that like you know
9056000	9058000	Sacramento local
9058000	9060000	arcade could take on the New York
9060000	9062000	City you know
9062000	9064000	58th street arcade
9064000	9066000	I don't even know what's on 58th street I just pulled the number out of my ass

9166000	9168000	nothing much you guys want to talk about
9168000	9170000	some games sure
9170000	9172000	what's up?
9172000	9174000	have you tried or have any of you tried
9174000	9176000	the
9176000	9178000	mexican wrestling game
9178000	9180000	AAA
9180000	9182000	I have not tried it
9182000	9184000	and I'm going to assume the other folks in the studio
9184000	9186000	probably haven't either but why don't you tell us all about it
9186000	9188000	I think if we knew more about it I think Dan would play it
9190000	9192000	well it's a
9192000	9194000	pretty interesting game
9194000	9196000	well basically
9196000	9198000	it's wrestling but
9198000	9200000	you have many
9200000	9202000	professional mexican wrestlers
9202000	9204000	and it's actually a pretty fun
9204000	9206000	game to play on multiplayer
9208000	9210000	is it like full on with all the theatrics
9210000	9212000	and masks and everything?
9212000	9214000	yeah oh that's awesome
9214000	9216000	yeah it actually
9216000	9218000	captures all the mexican
9218000	9220000	wrestling thing well
9220000	9222000	the action and all the
9222000	9224000	things that happen
9224000	9226000	on mexican wrestling the drama
9226000	9228000	yeah the drama
9228000	9230000	well basically
9230000	9232000	even the audience
9232000	9234000	plays a factor
9234000	9236000	well
9236000	9238000	plays in the game
9238000	9240000	not actually playing but
9240000	9242000	it plays a factor in the game
9242000	9244000	was this the game you were
9244000	9246000	telling us about previously that was actually developed in
9246000	9248000	mexico?
9248000	9250000	yes it was developed by
9250000	9252000	mexicans and columbians
9252000	9254000	I think
9254000	9256000	it was I think
9256000	9258000	published by konami
9258000	9260000	on the united states
9260000	9262000	awesome speaking of interesting
9262000	9264000	things published by konami I know this is
9264000	9266000	completely random but I have to get that out
9266000	9268000	at some point is that I was
9268000	9270000	at dave and busters over the weekend I think I mentioned
9270000	9272000	one of the things I played while I was there
9272000	9274000	it was a wheel of fortune ticket spitting
9274000	9276000	machine where you like guess the puzzle and everything
9276000	9278000	it was made by konami
9278000	9280000	couldn't believe it I didn't realize they had the license to do that
9280000	9282000	type of thing but they do a lot of arcade
9282000	9284000	stuff or uh redemption type of
9284000	9286000	things like slot machines and so forth
9286000	9288000	you said this was triple A
9288000	9290000	oh yeah
9290000	9292000	she's looking at a video here in the studio right now
9292000	9294000	of this game
9294000	9296000	yeah this
9296000	9298000	looks sick
9298000	9300000	triple A
9300000	9302000	or triple A
9302000	9304000	okay I think this
9304000	9306000	is immediately awesome
9306000	9308000	hmm
9308000	9310000	I'm just watching the intro of it that looks really cool
9310000	9312000	where's the gameplay okay I see that they
9312000	9314000	have some over the top wrestlers
9314000	9316000	oh it's the guy in the skeleton suit I love
9316000	9318000	that little creepy yeah he's called
9318000	9320000	la parka oh this is sweet
9322000	9324000	dark soccer is gonna be uh
9324000	9326000	getting her wrestling on okay
9326000	9328000	I actually like wrestling games believe it or not
9328000	9330000	cause I like customizing a wrestler
9330000	9332000	I think oh yeah
9332000	9334000	if you like wrestling games
9334000	9336000	you're gonna love this well we
9336000	9338000	used to get um all of
9338000	9340000	the uh the WWF or WWE
9340000	9342000	ones but cause the the big
9342000	9344000	thing about it is that because um
9344000	9346000	some of the publishing went overseas
9346000	9348000	is that they'd actually have some of the big moves from
9348000	9350000	some of the Japanese wrestlers
9350000	9352000	and we would you could
9352000	9354000	actually unlock like take all
9354000	9356000	these different parts and recreate
9356000	9358000	official you know Japanese wrestlers
9358000	9360000	in it and it was really awesome and
9360000	9362000	I remember okay do you remember WrestleMania
9362000	9364000	2000?
9364000	9366000	kinda for the Nintendo 64
9366000	9368000	yes I made this one
9368000	9370000	wrestler who was a
9370000	9372000	degeneration X guy and we had
9372000	9374000	him fight everybody and you know just
9374000	9376000	on like the watch mode and he beat everybody
9376000	9378000	including getting the women's belt
9378000	9380000	but
9380000	9382000	I also I like to do with those
9382000	9384000	games is just like make somebody and then just have
9384000	9386000	them go in watch mode on all of the
9386000	9388000	things I think that would be fun
9388000	9390000	alright Act F I got
9390000	9392000	one more question for you and that would be what was the
9392000	9394000	best game you played all last year using any criteria
9394000	9396000	you want?
9396000	9398000	I didn't play that many games this year
9398000	9400000	well last year
9400000	9402000	but I think what game that
9402000	9404000	I really found
9404000	9406000	interesting it was
9406000	9408000	it is
9408000	9410000	BB BB BB
9410000	9412000	or 6B
9412000	9414000	ah yes I heard you mention this in chat what was so great about it?
9414000	9416000	well it's actually
9416000	9418000	a pretty simple game
9418000	9420000	it's a simple platformer
9420000	9422000	though you control
9422000	9424000	you don't jump you don't
9424000	9426000	do any
9426000	9428000	spectacular thing like in Mario
9428000	9430000	or any platform like that
9430000	9432000	you control the gravity
9432000	9434000	you can go up or down
9434000	9436000	but you can't jump
9436000	9438000	or can't move
9438000	9440000	according to what you want to do
9440000	9442000	so you have to calculate
9442000	9444000	what you're going to do
9444000	9446000	if you're going to fall you have to
9446000	9448000	well
9448000	9450000	be very lucky or
9450000	9452000	some kind of
9452000	9454000	somewhat skilled
9454000	9456000	so you don't die because
9456000	9458000	many of the rooms are filled with spikes
9458000	9460000	that's why it's called
9460000	9462000	ah got it
9462000	9464000	interesting
9464000	9466000	it's also very cheap I think it's
9466000	9468000	$5 I think
9468000	9470000	and it's a pretty complete game
9470000	9472000	I think it's the best game
9472000	9474000	I played last year
9474000	9476000	simple jet innovative
9476000	9478000	alright great
9478000	9480000	I like hearing about some new games
9480000	9482000	and things that you know maybe some of the rest of us
