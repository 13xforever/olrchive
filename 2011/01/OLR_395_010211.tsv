9056	25593	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, January 2nd, 2011, a popular SoCal arcade prepares to shut its doors, a hype Japanese release underperforms, and a classic Super Nintendo RPG makes its way to mobile phones.
31687	36630	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36730	39351	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
39751	45474	Over the next few hours, we'll be talking to you about video games and gaming culture, gaming lifestyle, all that fun stuff.
45694	52458	A new year here at Orange Lounge Radio, our ninth year, if you can believe it, of broadcasting from 2002 to 2011.
53058	59001	My name is Rob Roberts, and with me, as always, as she has been for nine damn years, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
59021	59861	I hate that damn dragon.
61502	64685	We're gonna get to that in a minute because everything, like, changed.
64785	67707	It's like, it's like a new, is it technically a new decade now that it's 2011?
68207	68447	Yes.
69048	69268	Okay.
69628	71810	So, like, new decade, everything changed.
72030	73211	Seriously, I'm gonna get to that in a minute.
73391	74252	Nothing's changed.
74412	77935	I brought this- Techmaster Loki over there interjecting his opinion.
77975	78175	Yes.
78495	79136	Yes, Techmaster Loki?
79556	81538	Yes, I brought soup a few weeks ago.
81698	84060	Remember, I had two large soups and I'm like, look, I have two soups.
84120	85040	But tonight you brought four.
85060	85541	Now I have four soups.
86241	87422	Well, it wasn't intentional.
87462	88163	I only wanted to.
88183	90345	Instead of two large soups, he has four smaller soups.
90445	93067	Which I think is still more soup than it was before.
94068	95750	And that's value.
96230	107481	Now, I do have to introduce, always with us, the fourth guest on the show, officially, is our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com or we are on the IRC network on Gamesurge, if you find that, gamesurge.net.
108081	120829	and we are in Channel Orange Lounge but if you want to do that the real easy way just go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com but we do sometimes have guests in studio with us just to hang out and have some fun with us say hello to Gary is back tonight
121297	121938	Happy New Year!
122098	122798	How are you doing, Gary?
123219	123879	I'm doing alright.
124220	125941	You haven't been here in a few months.
125981	128944	I seem to remember the last time you were here, Loki was out.
129184	131846	So you were kind of a fill-in host-y type deal.
132066	132707	Yeah, something like that.
132867	135750	You're back tonight to kick off the New Year with us here at OLR.
136250	139993	We were off for the holiday break and all the December events that were going on.
140033	142996	Dark Sakura loaded her car and went up to Washington.
143236	144497	How was your Washington trip, by the way?
145798	146359	That fun, huh?
146917	148539	It was alright.
149900	155025	I watched a lot of the DIY Network and Chiller because they had a Buffy marathon.
156327	158429	Doesn't Chiller also run the Twin Peaks episodes?
158469	160130	I have no idea because I don't have cable.
160150	161252	What did you watch on DIY?
162792	164172	House Movers, that was pretty cool.
165493	169194	And I watched a lot of the home repair ones.
169634	172335	I learned the quick way to add in drywall.
172355	175595	Here comes Dan the Man, the husband of DarkSakura, always present here.
175615	176216	Am I on here?
176336	176856	Yes, you're on.
177096	181497	Before you listen to her bitch about it, she also got to drink ridiculously expensive wine.
181517	181777	I did.
182137	185798	And she got completely smashed with my dad, which was hilarious.
187341	189142	Your dad kept pouring me the wine.
189662	190862	And you kept drinking it.
191102	191983	And so did he.
192743	193043	Anyway.
193103	195784	And then he got an inversion table, so I'm drunk and upside down.
196064	198985	It was kinkier than it sounds.
199445	200506	With my dad.
200626	201266	Shut up!
201966	202787	You are a bastard.
203647	203967	Indeed.
204387	205468	It was a smooth pimp.
206488	209269	So before you let her go, oh, it sucked and I was bored.
209529	211190	I didn't say it sucked.
211290	211990	She had a good time.
212827	213667	I got to sleep the whole way there.
213708	214748	I saw her vlogs.
214828	215749	They were entertaining.
216069	218730	DarkSakura is a vlogger now with her little phonesy.
218890	219551	And disturbing.
219651	220711	Vlogging in the snow.
220812	223013	And then Dan's sitting there in the background like, hey, I'm Dan.
224293	224754	I'm driving.
225114	226875	I talked more on a couple that we didn't upload.
227275	227755	Oh, bugger.
227936	228856	Okay, well, I'm out of here.
228876	229717	All right, take care, Dan.
230077	233138	So yeah, we do occasionally talk about video games here on Orange Lawn Radio.
233158	234199	Video games, what the fuck?
234219	238802	Since it is a new year, let me just kind of reset the stage for everybody if we happen to have any new listeners.
238862	240463	So we're hitting the reset button real quick.
240543	240723	Beep!
241343	243424	Believe it or not, Dance Dance Revolution, we used to be obsessed with that game
269514	271317	Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, Rob, Rob.
272138	273279	For us, it was Parapara.
274401	277885	A little bit of that, too, and Beatmania, and a lot of those music-based video games.
277925	286918	So for a very long time, before there was even podcasting, we had a show on Live365 dedicated to music games and the music from them and so forth.
287338	287438	Meek!
310309	312670	Even first person shooters we might get to tonight.
313090	315051	And of course, food games.
315491	315951	Iron Chef?
316732	320553	I'm going to make a sandwich in a moment and I'm going to make a turkey and cranberry sandwich and it's going to be amazing.
320573	324055	The secret ingredient in Iron Chef the game is suck.
326843	327143	All right.
327684	329566	Anyhow, so that's our little show.
329646	330166	So welcome.
330207	330807	Thanks for joining us.
330827	334391	And of course, we do plug ourselves as the show where every gamer has a voice.
334431	340717	And we do mean that, you know, this show was started with a bunch of us kind of sitting around after a night at the arcade.
340737	345442	We used to go to this little restaurant called Brookfield's that was in the parking lot of the arcade where we all played at.
345742	346143	And we would have...
346463	349384	Old People Food Don't forget Rick's Glass of Merlot
365289	381714	Alright, anyhow Let's talk about games and your gaming week We were off last week because of Decemberween or whatever Yeah, Decemberween Whatever it is you celebrate Festivus, Christmas, Kwanzaa All of it All of it was an excuse to have last week off DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
383384	385005	Well, I played a lot.
385185	389629	Actually, I played a lot of Mushihime-sama Bug Panic.
390529	391770	Thank you so much, Loki.
391790	393472	That game is so freaking fun.
393992	397515	And seriously, it's like mix a cave shooter and an adventure game.
398055	399496	And it's bullet hell on feet.
400737	401398	It's fun.
401598	402418	It's super fun.
402999	404560	And so I played a ton of that.
405341	409204	And I feel dirty.
409944	410765	I feel dirty, Rob.
411536	411736	Why?
411816	412617	Why do you feel dirty?
413297	413638	Wow.
414979	417340	DarkSakura started playing World of Warcraft.
417400	418221	Oh my god, you guys.
418281	421603	It's like a total turnaround from her stance two weeks ago.
422244	424646	And I gained 30 levels in four days.
424846	429849	Okay, so before everybody starts yelling at you, Scab!
430110	430870	Defector!
431531	432111	You suck!
432651	433312	What is it?
434212	436934	What's the magic that's there now that wasn't there for you last time?
437855	438596	More to do.
441371	442952	You get the hell out.
443052	443653	Dan is in here.
443673	444553	You get the hell out.
445274	445994	You are not on.
446214	446394	No.
447255	451458	I'd like to give an F you to Rob for this whole fucking Warcraft thing.
451858	453119	I'm not having it in my house.
453879	455100	She can play for a while.
455560	456741	Then she's going to get all addicted.
456761	458262	Then I'm going to get a fucking divorce.
459623	461044	It's your fault, Rob.
461344	462165	It's not my fault.
462185	463005	I'm going to kill you.
463025	463946	Tiara plays too.
464006	464546	Blame her.
464706	465407	I don't like Tiara.
465427	465787	Oh, I like her.
469974	471094	You can get the hell out!
472815	474195	Should we call the police right now?
474355	474735	I don't know.
474755	476636	There's about to be a domestic disturbance.
476676	479597	At least it's all captured here on the radio.
481277	484378	Dan was in here doing the happy dance while I blithely flipped him off.
484938	486239	It was funny.
488871	489612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
507812	510814	And, like, even some of the missions are now, like, broken.
511675	515317	And as much fun as I was having, it's like, I'm kinda done.
515577	516778	You know, what more can I do?
517699	523162	So, um, I thought that the changes were really exciting, but really all I ever do is go in there, talk to my friends, and play Dabo.
524143	524543	That's it.
525464	531868	So, I was like, you know, the door of opportunity swung open, so I gave it a try.
532108	536551	Even after I was damn determined to play this game, because it did not want me to.
537912	542977	I defied every power that tried to prevent me from playing this game.
543137	543477	Meaning?
543998	551845	Meaning that my stupid theloader.exe was reading badly with Windows, so I had to rename it Bob, and then it worked.
553590	556013	No seriously, I tried every freaking thing.
556654	558857	I ran safe mode with networking.
558957	560018	I did all of this crap.
560399	562502	And finally I'm like, fuck you, I'm naming you Bob.
562822	563242	And it worked.
563262	566547	Wasn't there a program back in the day called Microsoft Bob?
566847	567308	I have no idea.
567348	570692	Isn't that like the reason we have Comic Sans in the world now?
570752	571032	Yeah.
572593	573874	By the way, I've got to go to our chat room.
574014	575554	You know they are the always present guests here on the show.
575594	576795	They're not allowed to talk.
577195	578355	BlackWolf, addict.
578935	580155	Actdeft, sellout.
580516	581876	Bochikawa, addict.
583656	585857	SalaciousPop in our chat room.
586577	592339	I was fine with my spouse's sleeping pill and QVC addiction, but I will not abide World of Warcraft in this marriage.
595100	599361	Is he trying to say that you're addicted to sleeping pills and QVC?
602126	608691	Dan admitted to me earlier today that he used to stay up late in his high school years watching the Home Shopping Network.
609391	620620	What other good shit about... I was in fifth grade, and I stayed up all night watching Home Shopping Network because I was up late, and it made me feel like somebody was up with me so I wouldn't be lonely.
621600	622381	Pathetic, huh?
622721	623182	Sad.
623542	625623	And it's hilarious because they're so stupid.
625683	627325	I love watching them sell a computer.
628857	631598	You press this button and it does stuff.
631698	632919	It comes with a free printer.
633279	636301	Didn't know your show was going to be a confessional tonight, did you?
636341	639622	It's like we're cleaning the slate for New Year's.
639982	642844	It's a confessional tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.
643204	647906	Get everything off your chest so that this new decade can be a relieving one.
649047	649627	Amen to that.
650385	671180	But, well, I am going to say that I have now made it from one side of the continent to the other On whatever freaking continent that is that you took me to Actually, first of all, you took me to this giant tree And then I jumped off, died, and then respawned at the bottom of the tree So that I wouldn't have to figure out how to get off of it And then just ran across the water
672952	673733	Star Trek Online
688830	695657	As I was going through all of the ranks and stuff, you get more of the story, and I was like, well, it's really fitting in well with Star Trek Universe.
696178	700322	And then I just got to this point, like, why are we fighting the Davidians?
700462	705947	They were the lamest, brain-sucking, interdimensional creatures ever.
708290	711113	Except that they gave me the cool Silent Hill thing, so that was cool, but...
711733	713694	I accidentally ran into an instance and got killed.
714514	715775	That has to happen at least once, I think.
716715	721217	It was the one that was underwater, like with all the underwater people.
721857	723478	Sounds like Black Fathom Depths.
723498	724098	That was it.
724378	724839	That was it.
724959	726039	Oh, it's sad I know that.
727320	733862	And now I'm in some place called the Battle Scar, and I couldn't find the damn flag, and then I just gained a level.
734463	734923	Congrats.
735063	735883	So what level are you now?
736243	737004	I know you're going to do it.
737024	737004	37.
737484	737644	In a row?
737664	737884	Yeah.
742118	748760	But I think I've done okay for myself because I've gotten there in technically six days of playing.
750460	750660	Right?
751740	753401	Yeah, you've been jamming right along.
754021	756942	Bochy Kawan, our chairman, says everyone jumps off of Teledrasil.
757122	757622	It's normal.
759502	760542	Is it like the Golden Gate?
761063	761323	Wow.
764147	769368	Loomies in our chatroom says, I hope we have another I slept with a forum troll reveal.
771468	771789	I don't know.
772209	774049	Gary, have you ever slept with a forum troll?
775329	775809	No.
776049	778810	Well, we had a guest a couple weeks ago that apparently had, so.
780570	784211	The only thing that forum trolls are fit for is machine gun targets.
785891	786252	All right.
786772	787292	Seriously, though.
787312	788152	But I got a melodica.
789517	790078	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
805260	808961	Um, no, I did other stuff, but I don't remember, so fuck it.
809881	811841	We've had a bunch of mame going on in the front room all day.
811901	814122	I heard they were playing Moonwalker when we got here.
814382	815142	And they played too.
815162	817302	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
817462	820803	No, no, wait, I had to go.
821083	821303	Ouch.
823364	828745	And, yeah, they've had the mame fest going on, and Dan has a new steering wheel for Gran Turismo 5.
831167	833008	I'm never going to call a WoW player an addict again.
833109	836511	I'm going to call Dan an addict.
836911	839013	It's a Bobby Blackwell joke.
840054	843657	Bobby is convinced that Gran Turismo 5 is not out because he's not seen it on a store shelf anywhere.
843777	844877	But your husband somehow has it.
845238	845678	You know what?
845798	850642	I can verify that it is out because sometimes I hear Dan yelling at it.
852643	858610	That though, and the biggest thing that I'm going to give it is that it has the Top Gear track and it has the Stig.
859711	864036	So it's instantly in my cool book forever because I freaking love the Stig.
865598	868902	He listens to all kinds of interesting music and he may or may not be an alien.
870313	872694	Okay, let's go to Loki.
872714	874915	Loki, how was your game week?
875315	875875	It was okay.
875955	876776	Didn't play a whole lot.
877956	879017	Just playing the same stuff.
879577	885059	I've been working on Grand Theft Auto stuff, just doing construction stuff with the mods.
885819	891344	Then also, of course, I've been playing some iPod games.
893346	894707	Some of these aren't exactly new.
895328	896449	Actually, most of these aren't new.
897069	899011	But they're very similar types of games.
899612	904156	Canabalt and I Must Run, both actually pretty much similar to Canabalt.
906518	912163	Based off the Flash game where you run and have to jump over pits and stuff like that without dying and it keeps getting faster and faster.
912643	917907	I must run, they try to add kind of a story to it, and it's kind of neat, and I like the presentation of it.
918267	920028	And then I also played this game, NOM.
922050	928434	It's like some time-traveling game that sort of reminds me of the art style of, like, Feel the Magic.
929475	930155	So that's kind of cool.
931616	954746	and then also played more Swords & Poker 2 which unfortunately is not on the app store anymore and same with the first one, Swords & Poker 1 but thankfully though I have a jailbroken iPod so I don't have that problem and I'm glad because those games are very addicting
956641	964827	And then also, I don't know if you noticed, but there was some new stuff actually coming on the App Store.
964847	965467	It was pretty cool.
965487	971811	They had one of the Tales games actually is now on the App Store.
972131	978115	So if you're a fan of that series, you might want to check that out because it looks just like the Super NES Tales game.
979816	984839	It was, let's see here, which Tales game was it?
984939	992902	Tales, I guess, Tales of Weaver, Lucian Cults.
994903	998244	But I guess it's based on the MMORPG.
1000045	1003387	But it looks like, you know, a nice 16-bit RPG game.
1005492	1020695	You know, I will say, even though you've been kind of slowly going this way over the past six months, maybe the biggest change for 2011 isn't the fact that Loki is not bringing bacon pizza to the show, but the fact that I would have never said two years ago that Loki would be the one here reviewing games that are out on the iTouch.
1021235	1027997	Like, call me crazy, but if you've listened to Loki's diatribes in the past on Apple products... I've already told you, though, it's...
1028437	1029278	I understand.
1029478	1031399	It's just, it's still a little bizarre.
1031859	1034661	It's Macs, not iThings.
1034701	1038364	See, the iThings, they are expensive, but they're good.
1038584	1041646	And the Macs, the Macs are fucking expensive.
1042206	1042927	They're not good.
1043007	1046409	You don't get very good value for what you purchase.
1046549	1053514	Basically, I mean, I would hope that if I'm spending $2,000 on a laptop that I'm getting something more than just one USB drive.
1053594	1055775	I don't care if it's paper thin.
1056296	1058137	I want a fucking computer that can do something.
1058998	1086979	so that's just my opinion but hey you know what teach their own and some people will buy you know Mac stuff forever and honestly I spent no money on this I had a stupid gift card that they gave me and it was either that or buying a bunch of Apple TVs to throw out a window or something I will say that Macs are still great for the graphics but now that Adobe's figured out that there's really a lot of PC users out there I have no need to have a Mac anymore
1089574	1090776	I would need new underwear every day.
1101169	1101789	They're pretty nice.
1101889	1105812	Our graphics department has some of those and they're nice.
1105912	1107753	But once again, it's a monitor.
1108294	1111556	And I'm sure that monitor is way overpriced for what it is.
1112797	1118260	I could buy a TV and hook it up and it would cost less than the monitor.
1118400	1123264	See, I have my iPod, which I can browse the web and stuff if I have a Wi-Fi spot.
1123284	1126746	And I have my phone, which I can browse the web too with that.
1126846	1130188	But honestly, I hate my phone's web browser.
1130248	1130969	It's terrible.
1131689	1132890	And it's slow.
1133090	1133890	What kind of phone do you have?
1134230	1140793	I have an Android phone, but it's a virgin mobile prepaid Android phone.
1140813	1142453	I don't think it's like a super Android.
1142473	1145254	No, it's like an Android light.
1145554	1146675	Android that plays Snake.
1148095	1156400	Yes, but it is an Android that I was able to root and add a thing to allow me to tether to it.
1156521	1160003	So I just tether this to it and I'm able to browse the web.
1160263	1160763	And I love it.
1161544	1161904	It's great.
1162104	1170609	And I use this actually a lot now to browse the web and check my mail or whatever instead of having to go to my computer, boot it up, and do all that stuff.
1171650	1172350	It's a lot quicker.
1172530	1173511	I just do it on here.
1174071	1174852	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1199526	1203268	So, Loki, what would you say to the description of a Mac as an overpriced fashion accessory?
1203288	1204749	True or false?
1204769	1205329	Or something else?
1216128	1237166	they buy into the brand and not necessarily it's for people they've kind of marketed them as PCs that are easy to use or laptops that are easy to use people don't want to try to learn stuff and they trust the Apple brand because it's been around forever and unfortunately people are willing to spend a lot of money for that
1237726	1241691	This is the impression I get, and I'm probably going to piss some Mac fans off, but oh well.
1243573	1244654	I had an Apple laptop.
1244854	1246356	It only lasted me a year, but I had it.
1247658	1254626	But anyway, I kind of get the sense that Apple, a lot of their systems, and I don't know why we've turned into this Mac versus PC war, but...
1255246	1255927	We'll get past it in a minute.
1255947	1256687	It's really preference.
1256747	1258429	I mean, if you want to buy one, go ahead.
1258469	1277504	But Macs are kind of like PC consoles to me and I think sometimes that's the advantage of them is that a lot of the software is very much customized for the Mac because their library is a little more limited than what you see on the PC and the expandability and customizability, while yes, I understand you can do some of it with Apple, they're not all over the fucking map like PCs are.
1278485	1282528	There's zillions and zillions of different types of PCs, but there's only so many types of Macs.
1282648	1284029	So I think the software...
1284850	1288271	by nature kind of is a little more optimized and runs a little better on Macs.
1288291	1300434	I think the App Store coming to the Mac is a great idea because, you know, at least then you have a lot of different programs and tools and stuff that people can just fill their computer with, like I have with my iPod.
1301394	1303935	So I think that's a good idea and they'll really fit with it.
1303955	1309096	But once again, it's basically just like, hey, look, it's just a more expensive iPad or something.
1309336	1311016	Now it's a computer iPad, you know.
1312277	1312597	I don't know.
1312637	1312937	It's just...
1313513	1314674	But iPads are so cute
1333543	1339830	Um, well, DarkSakura's husband's been kicking my ass thoroughly on Street Fighter 4 Super Turbo.
1340751	1345055	Um, yes, well, that goes without saying, I just started playing it, thank you.
1345395	1348879	I just said that I can't, that he can't help that he's not good at it.
1348959	1351982	That's because I haven't played it since I was in junior high, thank you.
1353704	1362252	And I also just started playing Batman Arkham Asylum, finally, which the graphics are wow.
1363834	1368599	And yeah, I know I'm trying to come lately to that party, but it's still something... I haven't touched the game.
1369059	1369559	Oh, okay.
1370180	1371761	Well, I feel a little bit better, but still.
1373642	1374342	It's a fun game.
1374402	1380906	I'm told that you can beat it in about eight hours if you're dedicated, but I'll drag it out and enjoy it as long as I can.
1383267	1387490	But yeah, I recently acquired an Xbox 360, and that's been a lot of fun.
1390271	1391152	and I'm quite impressed.
1391192	1399577	I also got a Samsung phone with Windows on it and I noticed it has the Xbox Live application.
1400597	1403999	I have yet to go through the catalog and see what games are available to download.
1404379	1405840	I think I saw Tetris as one of them.
1405880	1409763	That's been a big thing they're pushing lately is that the whole achievements from your phone and all that.
1412145	1417868	You know what's kind of cool, and I'm kind of off subject here real quick, but we were talking about my phone.
1418309	1424712	One thing I like, and this is something that I wish they would do with Steam and stuff, is the Android Marketplace.
1425133	1433717	Say you buy an app or something from them, and it either sucks or it doesn't work, you can get your money back and uninstall it.
1434278	1434558	Oh, wow.
1434578	1434758	Nice.
1434798	1435078	Yes.
1435398	1437740	I mean, that's awesome.
1437880	1438440	Why don't they have that?
1438500	1439641	They should really have that.
1440081	1440922	My iPhone lasts forever.
1461127	1467148	Well, the more you're online, the more you do the GPS-enabled stuff, of course, that's all going to be a battery drain.
1467168	1469769	So you just want to make sure you're not running anything in the background that is always GPS.
1469789	1474910	We were running the MP3 players from here to Washington and didn't use up the whole battery.
1475230	1477470	Surprisingly enough, MP3 really doesn't use up much battery.
1477690	1482491	And I was recording and Facebooking the entire way, too.
1482952	1486612	It only uses up a lot of battery if you continuously skip through songs, I've noticed.
1486632	1488313	If you just let it play, yeah, it'll go forever.
1489493	1489653	Yeah.
1491831	1494473	Well, anything else for your gaming week you wish to share with us, Gary?
1494933	1497635	Oh, just a lot of tabletop D&Ds.
1497875	1499457	Ah, that's right.
1499657	1502519	You're into the old school types of games, not really old school.
1502539	1511885	Yeah, but I like me some Final Fantasy too, and I've got a hold of Final Fantasy XIII and haven't had a chance to start it yet because I'm still one thing at a time.
1512205	1518069	And for the tabletop fans out there, because I know there's always a few, there's always a little bit of crossover between the video gaming circles and tabletop gaming circles.
1518530	1520611	What are your tabletop games of choice right now?
1523495	1528097	I've been playing D&D since 2000, so I'm kind of getting burnt out on fantasy.
1528377	1544803	I'm looking at Hero System, I'm looking at Mutants and Masterminds from Green Ronin, which just recently released a DC Heroes role-playing game based on the Mutants and Masterminds system last fall, and they're going to put out the third edition of Mutants and Masterminds very, very shortly.
1545203	1545904	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1556320	1556660	Alright.
1557121	1560222	Speaking of DC, there's a big new game coming out soon.
1560242	1563024	The DC Universe Online is out in about, what, one, two weeks?
1563164	1564305	I've seen screencaps from that.
1564365	1565025	It looks awesome.
1565105	1566286	Yeah, I've played the beta on the PC.
1566366	1567787	It's good times.
1567847	1569768	It's a little bit like if Ninja Turtles was an MMO.
1570709	1572190	Because it is a lot of beat-em-up.
1572630	1574811	It does come with a month of free play.
1575852	1577053	Well, that's customary, of course.
1577433	1578654	So we'll see.
1578674	1580094	Might have to look into that one.
1580655	1580915	Alright.
1581229	1582550	GameStop GameStop GameStop
1604147	1610711	And I played this at E3 and I was somewhat encouraged by what I saw with the whole Prince of Persia style fighting.
1611271	1616694	And I was seeing the light bike races on another screen, although that ended up really being the Wii version.
1617114	1620095	So I played the Tron game and it sucks.
1620215	1620556	I hate it.
1622436	1625298	I'm really disappointed because Tron deserves a better game than this.
1625658	1629480	And I'm sorry to say it, it was clearly, clearly...
1629500	1645082	clearly rushed to make the movie release and this shit always happens with games based on movies and that's why none of them are ever any good I should say rarely are they good and unfortunately it just falls in that same bin where the best part about it was the Daft Punk soundtrack in the beginning
1645282	1650466	It's supposed to kind of explain what happened between the first movie and the new movie.
1650526	1652308	And the new movie does some of that flashback as well.
1672966	1677572	So, there is overlap with the flashback sequences you see in the movie and what you play in the game.
1678193	1681938	Honestly, I think I'm just going to go on YouTube and try to find a compilation of all the cutscenes from the game.
1681978	1684141	There will be more Tron games, you know.
1684722	1685423	It's inevitable.
1685828	1686409	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1706189	1710812	Yeah, you know, and I'm doing the light bikes and they control like butt.
1711352	1714915	And I crashed my light cycle, I shit you not, like seven times.
1715315	1719518	And the whole like acceleration, deceleration doesn't really flow.
1720038	1725682	And there's this part where you are supposed to do this big jump, but if you haven't accelerated enough, you don't make the jump.
1725742	1732726	I mean, I'm literally sitting there going, did anybody play this game to see if it was fun?
1732847	1734688	Because it's not fun.
1735228	1738411	and that is so frustrating because it's Tron.
1739232	1741554	It's fucking Tron and it deserves to be so much better.
1741594	1742354	I was so mad.
1742815	1743455	I will tell you this.
1743856	1746678	Do not, do not spend $60 on this game.
1747099	1751903	Do spend 99 cents on the iPhone game that's out there because it's a better experience.
1752123	1752544	I have that.
1752604	1753144	It's great.
1753925	1755967	That was the other thing that I was trying to remember when I played.
1756027	1756847	That game is fun.
1758288	1759449	But you did see the movie, right?
1759589	1760909	Oh yeah, I fucking love the movie.
1761109	1762790	Well, you know that they're doing it twice.
1763070	1770113	They're doing like a Clone Wars thing with it where they're going to have an animated series that's going to be between the first and second movies.
1770473	1771713	Yeah, that sounds interesting.
1771833	1774114	You should totally read the comics, by the way.
1774515	1775655	The Betrayal.
1776155	1776715	They're really good.
1776915	1779416	I wonder if there's any overlap with that in the game as well.
1779697	1781837	But let me tell you, here's some of my problems with the game, you guys.
1781977	1783438	Because, you know, I'm sitting here going, it stinks.
1784218	1792581	The thing is that a lot of the combat feels really repetitive and there's some frame rate issues when you're throwing the disc.
1792621	1796323	It just kind of seems to bounce all over the screen in random frames.
1796883	1800985	The multiplayer, what would you think multiplayer would be in Tron?
1801185	1804226	What would you think would be the first thing you're going to go into in a multiplayer in Tron?
1804446	1804726	Anybody?
1805006	1805747	Light Cycles?
1805928	1806469	Don't you think?
1806749	1806929	No.
1807310	1808231	Or the disc thing.
1808332	1809273	Nope, it's a battle arena.
1809453	1810215	It's not the disc thing.
1810255	1815684	It's just 20 people in a big clusterfuck arena all derezzing each other.
1816272	1817974	There were no light cycles up front, huh?
1840436	1840957	You know what I mean?
1841197	1841697	And it's not.
1842097	1846881	I went into this ultra-lame, 20-people-just-all-throwing-just-each-other mode.
1846901	1848042	Or the light jets, you know?
1848702	1849403	That would have been cool.
1849423	1850444	Oh, the light jets would be awesome.
1850724	1851144	Oh, yeah.
1851224	1853546	Or the little, like, mosquito-looking guys in the movie.
1853566	1854247	It was awesome.
1854927	1857229	Wyland in our chatroom says, play a real Tron game.
1857269	1857469	Play 2.0.
1858169	1858690	You know what?
1859290	1861792	I've heard a lot of good things about that game, and I probably should.
1863033	1863774	You're probably right.
1864494	1864654	So...
1865675	1866976	I was going to ask you about that.
1867376	1872059	Were there any other Tron games that came out before the movie besides 2.0?
1873140	1877443	Just Tron 2.0 that I know of, and that's not counting any fan stuff.
1877903	1882206	Because the Tron sequel's been in development for quite some time, from what I understand.
1882266	1884408	So there's been an absence of Tron things.
1884908	1889671	I mean, not counting Xbox Live Marketplace had rehashes of the Tron and Distotron.
1889691	1891853	I don't even think you can get them anymore because of license issues.
1892673	1895975	But, you know, if you don't count that, then... This is where it gets awesome.
1896875	1897816	Tron Deadly Discs.
1899816	1905019	So, and Wyland just wants to say, yeah, 2.0 is far, far better than Evolution.
1905439	1907480	And TigerClaw says, Sky, light cycles are in there.
1907520	1909681	I think it's the RB button that puts you in light cycle mode.
1910761	1914305	Well, I mean, I know light cycles were like in the game, but is it multiplayer?
1914325	1918690	Because when I was like circling around the different arenas, it was all different types of melee.
1919190	1919991	So whatever.
1920151	1927619	I mean, call me an idiot if you want, but the fact that I couldn't find that very easy, I think speaks for itself, right?
1929499	1929659	Yeah.
1929699	1930639	So, anyhow.
1931040	1938785	Unfortunately, if you must rent Tron for the story, do not, do not spend $50 or $60 on this game.
1938805	1939786	Just go to the Tron Wiki.
1941187	1942868	I've already read the whole thing on the Tron Wiki.
1942928	1944650	Well, I mean, it's nice to see it.
1944710	1945990	Like, it's fun to see the movie.
1946931	1947331	Rent it.
1948032	1950033	It's at most worth a $5 rental.
1950674	1952155	And you could probably play through it in a weekend.
1953115	1956816	Or, most red boxes nowadays do have game rentals as well.
1956916	1959137	You can rent it for one day for like two bucks.
1959177	1960137	There you go.
1960737	1964498	That's probably, that sounds, from what you were saying, that sounds like about all it's worth.
1964958	1967539	So I'm going to move up the scale in games I played this week.
1967579	1968639	So here's the next game I played.
1968719	1970260	White Knight Chronicles came out in 08.
1970760	1973261	It's like a level 5 game for the PlayStation 3.
1973301	1974821	What was it?
1974941	1978122	Final Fantasy XI, the offline version almost?
1978702	1979843	Well, here's the thing.
1980463	1982724	I'm not sure what the fuck this game is.
1982845	1985046	And that's the weird thing about it.
1985266	1996993	I kind of feel like White Knight Chronicles is one of those games where it has a bit of an identity crisis where they try to do so much with it that they have a lot in the game but it doesn't do any of it exceedingly well.
1997753	1999534	And it's not that I dislike the game.
1999834	2003637	It's been interesting to me enough where I've sank like four hours in it so far.
2004177	2006678	But I don't know.
2006778	2006879	It's...
2007819	2008660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2027944	2052850	so okay whatever so the main character and his little lackey you go off on the adventures and you know you're killing things and the battle system is the closest thing I could compare it to is like Final Fantasy 12 it is an interesting battle system because you can kind of do like live attacks and things and the coolest part was that you can create combos based on your class and you can kind of like string these combos together that you've created and so it's kind of kind of cool like I like that um
2053710	2054010	And then...
2073704	2077946	After you're about a couple hours into the story, it says, by the way, there's this whole geonet thing.
2078266	2083169	You can hook up online and play with other people and get quests and do this stuff together.
2083649	2089692	And so I'm like, oh, maybe that's why your character's been a lackey this whole time, because that's really going to be your online character.
2090092	2095315	Even though they had nothing to do with the single player mode, this character's going to be like your little online person.
2096255	2115730	and I don't know and then the game starts to feel like now I'm playing Phantasy Star Universe there's all these quests that you can kind of do and there's recommended levels and you go out in the field and do your goal like it really kind of felt like Phantasy Star Universe where you play the single player for a little while and then all of a sudden it's like oh hey it's a multiplayer game too
2117132	2118433	So it was really weird.
2118933	2120174	I don't know how else to explain it.
2120395	2132485	And sometimes the camera can kind of bug and sometimes the battle system starts to feel a little bit like, okay, could I gain my little powers a little faster so I could do the cool stuff more often?
2132505	2134307	Because right now this feels very slow moving.
2134868	2137930	So yeah, White Knight Chronicles, a bit of an identity crisis.
2138511	2139311	I didn't hate it.
2139972	2146724	I don't love it, I like it, but I have a really difficult time explaining to anybody what the game is.
2147185	2149646	So you're rating them in a nutshell as just what, meh?
2150746	2161411	I think if you like Japanese RPG type of games, and you like the more action-y based ones, like you like Phantasy Star Online, it's not press X to swing your sword.
2161651	2163892	It's a little more active time battle than that.
2164412	2168013	But if you kind of like that sort of idea, then I think you'd like it.
2168033	2172095	And if you like a grind fest, I think it would be permissible.
2172235	2174956	And especially now that you can find it most places like $30, $35, that's a fair price to pay.
2176977	2190989	considering it has a pretty robust online mode that you're not paying a monthly fee for so I'll give it that and I guess there's a sequel that came out in Japan but I don't think it's coming out here because unfortunately I do not believe the game did too well so there you go
2191676	2195517	Yeah, so that was the weird thing.
2197097	2198678	Then I played Fallout 3.
2199418	2200658	I was partying like it was 2008.
2202158	2204839	But I finally got a hold of this game on the used game sale.
2205059	2209320	And yeah, I think the people describing it as oblivion with guns, really good.
2209680	2210600	Great story though.
2210860	2212681	I was totally into it in the beginning.
2212701	2218602	I think they do a great job kind of setting the stage as you're doing that whole like baby to child to adult and...
2219402	2246844	and all that and I don't want to spoil anything even though the game is like years old now but you know it's kind of like how you get to where you are in the story and why you're in a nuclear wasteland and all this stuff and yeah the only unfortunate thing about it is that if you don't save often like an NPC you might have wanted to do a quest for will end up dead and now you can't do that quest so save now save often that's really the only terrible thing I can think about it otherwise I gotta say the
2247504	2271539	Another reason why I really like this game is that it's not just that it's, like, first-person shooter, but you can use some of, like, your little power by hitting the right bumper to go into, like, this, like, focus attack mode where if I suck at first-person shooters, at least if I'm, like, kind of, like, stealthy enough and save up those action points, I can still shoot someone in the head with a very accurate shot because it basically stops the game and you can focus on a part of the body and it tells you the percentage.
2271559	2272539	So it's sort of bullet time.
2272559	2275081	Yeah, a little bit because it tells you, like, the percentage of success.
2275421	2275721	Oh, cool.
2275741	2276662	So I thought that was kind of neat.
2277202	2292759	so yeah I like Fallout and it's a beautiful game and there's so much to it and if you have the game of the year edition you just have quest upon quest upon quest so yeah I've already sank quite a few hours into that game so I liked my Fallout 3
2295461	2295902	Let's see.
2296122	2297303	Something else I want to talk about.
2297623	2303948	I've had 11 days in a row off of work because at my work we take the entire time between Christmas and New Year's off.
2304029	2305069	It's like a PTO thing.
2305089	2306050	I won't get into details.
2306090	2306571	That's what we do.
2307431	2310434	So I've had 11 days to kind of play some games and so forth.
2311894	2313375	One day I decided, you know what?
2313635	2315415	I'm going to watch The Tester, season two.
2315595	2317196	I'm going to just download every single episode.
2317216	2318616	I'm going to watch the whole damn thing.
2319576	2320336	Shermie, don't listen.
2320416	2320977	Yeah, Shermie.
2321637	2323197	Has Shermie's bowels been voided?
2323237	2326338	Okay, Shermie's asleep, so hopefully she won't hear me talking about this.
2327318	2328439	I got to admit something, you guys.
2328719	2331119	It was actually a pretty good show.
2331839	2334040	It was better than the first season, what I watched of it.
2335821	2360263	I think the show now here's the show if you haven't heard of it it's like a you can only download the show it's only available on PlayStation Network and it's a show about people that are imagine it's The Apprentice but like the Donald Trump show you're fired but it's with video games and the ultimate job is to become the PlayStation tester which is why this show is getting a lot of shit because what a glamorous job game testing is right but what I like about the show
2361963	2372112	What I ended up ultimately liking about it was that it didn't really hide the fact that none of these people really had the goal of being a PlayStation tester.
2373193	2382020	A lot of them said, fully self-aware, I want this job to get my foot in the door so I can work with these people to work my way up.
2382661	2386885	And like this one girl, she even says in one episode, you know what, I don't even own a PlayStation 3.
2387825	2389166	I want to make games for children.
2390308	2391769	and you might kind of look at that and go, what?
2391809	2392690	You don't even know PlayStation 3?
2392730	2393751	What the hell are you doing on this show?
2393771	2405022	But I kind of looked at that going, that's really kind of honest of Sony to have in there because if you think everybody that's working in the video game industry right now grew up on video games, you've got a wake-up call coming.
2405763	2410147	And so I thought it was a very kind of like honest response and another guy had said, you know what?
2410227	2411909	I want to do this so I can get into PR.
2413210	2427687	and uh yeah so it seemed like everybody that was kind of on the show like actually really wanted to be there and i have to admit i can't remember the last time i saw a reality show where by the time it was down to the last episode the final three people like i would have been happy with any any single one of them winning
2428387	2436572	Um, ultimately the person that won, I thought was, uh, uh, a person that was really going to use, uh, you know, their, their potential and so forth.
2436592	2439413	But I would have been happy if Sony had really ended up hiring any of them.
2439433	2441655	Cause you know, they, they, I thought they'd kind of told a good story.
2442355	2446257	Um, so when I say like, oh my gosh, you should drop everything you're doing and watch this show.
2446738	2451460	No, I mean like really, I should have been like trying to catch up on True Blood or some other show.
2451480	2452481	I don't know why I was watching this.
2452981	2453862	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2474426	2476327	What does this have to do with game testing?
2476367	2477607	Does it have anything to do with game testing?
2478287	2479087	But it's TV.
2479468	2480368	Look at The Apprentice.
2481028	2485569	What does a lot of the crap they do on that show have to do with actually running a company?
2486170	2491971	Not a lot, but usually there's that one little tip in it that is kind of the focus of the episode.
2491991	2492632	And that's the same thing.
2492672	2494972	I mean, this show is a complete ripoff of The Apprentice in many ways.
2495393	2499394	So, yeah, I really didn't hate it.
2500214	2501015	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2515405	2528111	The people that didn't even want to be there or were just cast, the very first person that was off that show, I was like, if this person lasts in the show, I'm going to just swallow my own tongue or something.
2528171	2529532	It's just terrible.
2529652	2531693	But the very first person they kicked off was the right person.
2531773	2533094	It was somebody who didn't even need to be there.
2533854	2534415	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2553581	2560663	Look at our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Bochikawa in our chatroom says, Oh, Tester, I thought that it was interesting this run.
2560703	2562324	That jerk must have been a plant.
2562684	2566966	I really don't think anyone would go that far to be an asshole and would get anywhere near thinking he wants a job.
2567586	2568266	I think you're right.
2568406	2570487	I think he was one of those people that was cast for drama.
2570547	2579250	I mean, maybe he did want the job, but not as bad as the people that ultimately make it to the final episode and that do end up ultimately getting the job.
2579650	2579750	So...
2580450	2581333	Yeah, there you go.
2581835	2582979	Not as terrible as I would have thought.
2583340	2584243	I know, I was surprised.
2584484	2585186	Maybe you would be too.
2585226	2585527	Who knows?
2586417	2586897	So that's it.
2586977	2587978	That's it for my gaming week.
2588859	2590640	Let's quickly do some housekeeping.
2591821	2594904	You can join us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
2595224	2597305	We'll be taking some tweets later on in the show, of course.
2598006	2602269	And we will be, of course, looking at our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
2602749	2608394	And if you don't already have us on Facebook, please consider adding us, facebook.com slash orangeloungeradio.
2608874	2611056	And with that, we'll get into some gaming news tonight.
2611136	2612517	And Loki, as always, will start us off.
2613164	2615246	Yes, and this is kind of interesting.
2616948	2621732	You know, the PlayStation 3 hacking news, it's kind of been going back and forth as far.
2622133	2626997	Okay, we found a crack, and oh hey, we patched a crack, and so on and so forth.
2627077	2629479	But this, I don't know if they can be able to recover from.
2630360	2636125	During the kind of hacker conference going on right now, the Chaos Communications Conference 27C3,
2638547	2653736	Um, apparently the hackers responsible for the Wii's homebrew channel, um, who I guess is the group called, uh, Fail Overflow, gave a presentation, um, which they've said they figured out the private key, uh, Sony uses to authorize code to run on retail PS3 systems.
2654336	2662141	Uh, what that means is that hackers would have almost full control of the PS3 system without the use of a USB device.
2662981	2667544	Um, basically it means they'd be able to sign their own code and you'd be able to, uh,
2669329	2677257	Do a lot of things on there, including their whole big thing is to run Linux on PS3s, whatever the firmware version is.
2678058	2680560	Of course, they're not really interested in piracy with this.
2681041	2688088	Obviously, people could adapt it to do that, but they're really kind of concerned with just the applications of it and...
2690390	2699118	Some of the things that was kind of neat about it is that they literally have almost access to all the cores and everything using this.
2700219	2700940	It's just kind of neat.
2701821	2706405	Who saw this punchline coming a mile away when the PlayStation 3 first did away with Linux?
2706485	2710049	This is actually hard-coded into each console.
2710089	2711350	There's no way to patch this.
2713438	2713939	They can't.
2714659	2715900	Wow.
2716100	2720002	Basically, what they can do is they create keys or whatever.
2720062	2723424	These USB devices have keys on them assigned to them.
2723564	2731189	What they've done to prevent those jailbreak devices from working is they add blacklists for different keys.
2731849	2735151	The master key, you can create your own keys from it.
2735691	2737372	They block one, you can just create another one.
2738133	2740794	It's just impossible to stop it.
2742196	2743017	So what happens now?
2743097	2744158	Piracy runs rampant?
2744539	2745620	Not necessarily.
2746200	2749403	Their whole big thing is they're not aiming towards piracy.
2749483	2753007	They just want to bring homebrew to the PS3.
2753768	2756591	Linux is really what they're looking to do.
2756611	2758773	Let's bring Linux back, I guess.
2759287	2764050	But don't you think this would have also been a conclusion anyway, even if Sony hadn't done away with Linux?
2764551	2766472	Do you think that maybe they were working on this anyway?
2767733	2770314	Or, I mean, I guess, you know, what do we know?
2770354	2774197	We're not in this little organization or whatever, but it's just interesting to me.
2774237	2782462	It's really interesting that, you know, Sony kind of pulls the plug on the whole Linux thing because they were worried about people exploiting it for piracy, really, at the end of the day.
2782943	2787406	And now it's like, well, we're just going to shove Linux in this thing whether you like it or not.
2788206	2793570	And if they can install Linux on a frickin' toaster, they can install Linux on a hacker-proof PSP.
2793590	2799614	This is probably worse than the whole exploit through Linux to begin with.
2799654	2804337	Because a lot of people may not have had Linux on their system, or weren't even interested in that.
2804717	2814044	But the fact that they took it away, and people don't like when things are taken away, especially when they've paid for them, whether it's an advertised feature or not, I don't care.
2815285	2816866	Now, to be fair, just devil's advocate...
2817586	2820487	You don't have to patch your PlayStation 3 to remove the Linux.
2820847	2823007	You just won't be able to play any games in the past year or two.
2823027	2825648	Functionality is removed from your system.
2826228	2827208	That's basically it.
2827469	2830949	We can either say, oh, well, you could lose Linux.
2831130	2835411	You get column A, games made in 2010, or you get column B, Linux.
2836111	2836751	You can't have both.
2837552	2839633	So, that's kind of lame.
2841214	2845756	But it's going to be interesting to see where this goes from here because that's bad.
2846616	2851118	SSJ100Matt in our chatroom says, I don't know, I still think people are going to use it to pirate games.
2851218	2852699	Well, yes, of course.
2852799	2854740	There are people out there that are going to do that.
2855080	2859542	And I don't doubt that they're going to find ways to do that.
2859582	2864184	But it's just that the aim of this group wasn't to just...
2865405	2866286	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2881105	2886726	while I'm sure there's some people working for Sony 365 days a year, there's probably a lot of people coming back tomorrow.
2886746	2889027	And it's going to be interesting to see what their kind of response is.
2889387	2891107	If they do try to patch it.
2891147	2892347	I know you say it's unpatchable.
2892487	2893768	They try to do something.
2893788	2894988	I mean, they've got to.
2895008	2896408	They kind of owe it to their third party.
2896428	2898489	Basically, they've got a lot of things.
2899169	2902009	Even just after this conference, they have things being released.
2902689	2905390	That group has already released the development tools for...
2906450	2907251	The stuff that they have.
2907291	2924240	So now they have different, you know, like early code and stuff to code to pack and unpack PUP and package files to make and read selfs and other developer related stuff.
2924300	2929803	So, you know, look forward to possibly, you know, custom firmware and whatnot.
2930143	2931624	And they've already released the root key.
2931704	2933405	So, I mean...
2935103	2936204	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2958297	2958737	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2977086	2978587	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3004964	3005244	DarkSakura.com
3021463	3027067	We don't want gamers to be asking, what's the difference between a PlayStation phone or a phone and a PSP?
3027528	3030210	We have to come up with a message that users will understand.
3030610	3034093	It would have to be a product that keeps the PlayStation's strengths intact.
3034533	3042620	Again, sort of, you know, kind of not outright saying there's a PlayStation phone, but saying, you know, we're trying to kind of...
3044642	3045662	You have to do it right.
3045762	3046703	And of course, we're doing it right.
3046723	3047844	Surprise for once.
3047924	3049004	Come on.
3049785	3051006	Please.
3051406	3054528	Well, Consumer Electronics Show is this weekend, if I'm not mistaken, or this week.
3054548	3055448	Yeah, I think so.
3055628	3060972	So you might see it there, but I mean, if it's... I would say this.
3061132	3066615	If the phone and the PSP2 are separate, I would say you'll see the phone at CES.
3066695	3069557	You might see it as soon as CES, possibly Game Developers Conference.
3070177	3072318	PSP2, however, E3.
3074420	3076763	Game Developers Conference Game Developers Conference
3089218	3089578	Arcade Infinity
3118760	3119120	Uh-oh.
3119501	3119961	It's gone.
3121722	3122823	The inevitable has happened, huh?
3122843	3127646	It's closing on January 15th, so we need to go take a trip to LA, like now.
3127787	3128647	Like tomorrow, yeah.
3128707	3129107	I know, right?
3129127	3131549	Good luck, right?
3132550	3137654	Basically, Arcade Infinity was the big place that got a lot of RB money in the US.
3138894	3141937	Not just that, but a lot of just import games in general.
3142677	3146159	I played an Oom Jam Alami arcade machine at Arcade Infinity.
3146179	3148561	And the tambourine version of Samba de Amigo.
3148621	3151683	Which, by the way, is the gayest video game I've ever played in my life.
3152063	3155065	It's tambourined or whatever.
3155125	3157967	You shake around a tambourine like you're Stevie Nicks.
3158047	3158527	It's crazy.
3160629	3162210	Except without the big hobo.
3164841	3165782	I'm sorry, I meant Boho stuff.
3187396	3200676	that was the first place I ever played Typing of the Dead yeah I know and we're like oh my god it's in Japanese we could get as far as the boss that would ask you questions and you'd have to answer them and then it'd be like shit I don't know Japanese I can't do it
3202520	3206683	But I mean, man, I just have so many good memories of that place.
3206783	3211046	But now, you know, it's going to be closing.
3211446	3212187	It's going away.
3212827	3214348	Well, I gotta be honest.
3214368	3220292	The last time I was there, it didn't have quite the wonder that it had, you know, when I was there back in its heyday.
3220956	3223617	But I think that's sadly arcades in general.
3223697	3230820	I really hate to say it, but man, the online stuff is really taking its toll.
3230860	3231761	I mean, it's kind of obvious.
3231861	3238064	Well, you know, the other thing that they were doing there was selling import skylines.
3239624	3241005	Like bringing in cars from Japan.
3241025	3241925	Oh, yeah, I remember that.
3242305	3244746	And trying to make them street legal for sale in the U.S.
3244806	3245247	Yeah, yeah.
3246688	3251894	But yeah, apparently Bimani-style folks are having a gathering there for the last day.
3252195	3260605	Our buddy DJ Tyrant, who once in a while does some stories for OrangeLaundry.com, he's going to go and give us a little report.
3260685	3263249	So since I can't be there, it'll be nice to have somebody there.
3263529	3264330	Bring me back a token.
3265470	3267052	I probably have a bunch still somewhere.
3267092	3270955	I know I've got some somewhere, but that's just really sad.
3270995	3282806	Because, I mean, whenever we would go to LA, we would always make it a point that we were going to go to Arcade Infinity and then we'd go have dinner at that place that you had to walk all the way freaking across a football field-sized parking lot to go eat at.
3283727	3285369	And then we'd go back and play more games.
3285589	3288171	And then, you know, it's just sad.
3289152	3289933	Very, very sad.
3290697	3312482	what's just sad in general that here's another great arcade closing its doors and this is a trend we saw starting years ago with what Southern Hills Golf Land Folsom Game Room you know all these arcades just started closing and closing and even the arcades that are still there which would be like Roseville Golf Land and some of the other golf lands that are out there are nothing but ticket redemption machines now you know what I mean
3313160	3315782	Shermie's trying to get out so she can go poop on the tester.
3315903	3317344	Yep, I figured as much.
3317584	3318385	She's probably trying to get out.
3319005	3319466	No, she's fine.
3319766	3319846	Okay.
3319866	3320927	She's sitting underneath your butt.
3320947	3322128	As long as she doesn't poop in the corner.
3322549	3323409	She's sitting underneath you.
3323670	3323890	Okay.
3324090	3328934	But Shermie is equally sad about the closure of Arcade Infinity.
3329115	3329575	It is sad.
3329615	3333158	I mean, certainly back in the heyday, that was the only place I could play Keyboard Mania.
3333719	3333999	Yeah.
3334680	3334860	So...
3335752	3339335	and I just remember playing the crap out of that Gundam game.
3339695	3343177	Well, somebody needs to take a 40 and pour it out in the parking lot.
3343197	3346240	I wonder what they're doing with the rest of their candy cabs because they were selling them.
3346460	3348881	Unfortunately, I only have good beer so I'm not going to do that.
3349842	3352144	Just go to BevMo and get one crappy beer so you can.
3352944	3354846	Ice cold, Colt 45.
3355206	3358488	DJ Tyrant, Colt 45, dump it in the lot.
3358768	3359209	Thank you.
3359569	3360810	Please, and take pictures of it.
3360850	3361490	On behalf of OLR.
3361851	3362631	Take pictures of it.
3363672	3365133	One for me and one for my homies.
3366980	3368341	Rest in peace, Arcade Infinity.
3368381	3369102	Sorry to see you go.
3369362	3370784	I wonder what they're doing with their cabinets.
3372425	3373226	You opportunist.
3373446	3375768	Probably the same thing that Tilt at the Metron is doing.
3375788	3377610	You want to get a Beat Mania machine for 300 bucks?
3377650	3386978	I should check... Speaking of other arcades that have gone away, you get a Marvel vs. Capcom for 300 bucks.
3387118	3389200	Alan saw that and he said, Christmas, Rob, Christmas!
3389500	3389921	Christmas!
3392063	3393204	Poor, Alan, poor!
3394229	3395970	All right, anyway.
3396251	3397171	Yeah.
3397332	3404097	Well, Nintendo is warning that you shouldn't have children under the age of six playing the 3DS in 3D mode.
3404517	3406499	Apparently, it'll make them go cross-eyed.
3407099	3410202	Well, that's not the reason, but it may hurt their vision.
3411783	3413264	So, it's bad.
3413865	3417488	So, don't play it in 3D mode unless you want cross-eyed kids.
3418269	3419170	Oh, come on.
3421051	3426735	Surely it can't be that you play this for five minutes and you're going to go cross-eyed.
3426955	3430578	We're talking about prolonged exposure is what this is.
3431738	3434840	Nintendo's probably overreacting so there isn't a lawsuit.
3434881	3441385	When at the end of the day, this really comes down to parents, you really should watch how much games your six-year-old is playing.
3441545	3450668	Exactly, and that brings up a wonderful point, is that you can use the included parental controls that allow parents to lock the device in 2D mode.
3453349	3454150	So it's the 3DS, 2DS.
3456175	3456935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3478107	3504559	but uh you know they were showing a trailer for Tangled you know the Rapunzel movie that's out in theaters by the way it was actually really good I saw it yesterday um they were showing a trailer for that at E3 on 3DS so they're gonna market 3D movies for kids on these things so you know I mean granted you could say that well Tangled would also work for a 10 to 15 to an adult really you're old come on
3505539	3506960	To an adult year old?
3507560	3508020	You know what I mean.
3508260	3513443	You know what parent isn't going to want to sit their six year old in the back of the car and have them watch Tangled to shut them up on a road trip?
3513843	3514523	In 3D!
3515044	3516084	And you know what's great?
3516144	3522507	It'll be like buying an expensive 3D HD television and going, you know what?
3523127	3523928	I'm watching all 2D.
3525925	3527347	I don't need this 3D.
3527668	3532675	I'll pay your high premium price for your TV with fancy technology.
3532775	3533817	In fact, you know what?
3534017	3535840	I'm not even hooking up HDMI to it.
3536260	3538203	I'm going straight composite, bitch.
3538844	3540967	So, Nintendo is paranoid.
3541508	3555312	that some kid somewhere is going to go cross-eyed because they spent 12 hours a day looking at the 3DS and so they're putting this disclaimer on it to kind of save their own butt because some parents can't be bothered to watch how much their kids are playing games.
3555492	3556873	That's what the story should really say, right?
3558813	3559634	At least that's what I think.
3559694	3560294	Enablers.
3561594	3564677	I love this chat room chatter here.
3565117	3566178	Big wang eater.
3567820	3571263	So that'd be cool if 3DS had a deer hunter in 3D.
3571383	3572224	Well, you know what?
3572264	3573445	Cabela's comes out each year.
3573505	3575707	They've been doing a lot of games on the DS.
3576107	3579290	I would not be surprised if you see a 3DS Cabela's game.
3579490	3583253	And somewhere, somehow, some idiot parent will let their kid play that.
3583313	3584594	Their six-year-old kid play that in 3D.
3584614	3585775	Big wang eater.
3586456	3587317	Thank you, big wang eater.
3588499	3589360	All right.
3589400	3590080	3D porn.
3590120	3592281	Well, the big wing eater goes on to say 3D porn.
3592301	3595803	Well, you know, you will be able to take your own 3D pictures with this.
3596083	3598605	You can show the big wing being eaten.
3598885	3600686	Can you share the pictures you take on the internet or whatever?
3600726	3601146	I think you can.
3601446	3601806	Awesome.
3602287	3602587	Hot.
3602647	3603487	Time to penis.
3603807	3604848	Five seconds.
3604888	3605789	He said coming at you.
3608770	3609310	You know what?
3609690	3617773	See, some of us actually have people that we can do this in real life with and don't need to watch it in 3D.
3618233	3620014	We have what's called real life.
3622375	3630758	They've also already been marketing, like when I did see that whole Tangled movie, which by the way, I saw lots of six-year-olds in that theater wearing 3D glasses and watching the movie, but anyway.
3632719	3635221	They were showing a commercial for a 3D camera.
3635641	3639604	And you could watch the pictures on your 3D TV that you take with the new camera.
3640364	3641625	And this isn't DS related.
3641665	3644327	It's like a new Sony camera or whatever that does 3D pictures.
3644527	3647109	Because everybody has a boner for 3D right now.
3647509	3649171	I like what Azim said.
3649931	3651092	4D porn sex across time.
3651112	3652393	What?
3653774	3654414	I approve of that.
3655795	3656136	Alright.
3656636	3657897	That's what you need a TARDIS for.
3659011	3663733	Well, moving on to other things Nintendo that aren't necessarily 3D, but I bet a lot of people wish this was.
3663793	3665633	The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.
3665673	3666534	Hey, remember?
3666554	3667994	There's a new Zelda game coming, you guys.
3668034	3668354	Remember?
3669135	3671296	Does he have the upward thrust?
3671316	3674337	They were talking about it at E3 and it was delayed from Christmas.
3674697	3675297	Rob ignored it.
3675597	3675797	What?
3676077	3677398	As if he has the upward thrust.
3679419	3680499	Only in 2D, I'm sorry.
3681339	3682300	But here's the deal, guys.
3682340	3689342	Not only has it been delayed past Christmas, but now Nintendo is kind of saying, yeah, that whole early 2011 thing.
3690102	3690543	Liars!
3691043	3692563	I don't know if that's going to happen.
3692603	3695945	Because, of course, there is very dense gameplay.
3696165	3698966	And you're going to want to replay this game once you've finished it.
3699086	3699726	That's not a...
3700306	3702667	That's not a description for gameplay.
3702767	3707029	They have quietly moved this game to a 2011 release.
3707489	3709010	Could be any time next year.
3709370	3714072	We need to save it for our VHD.
3714312	3716333	It's going to be a game that's slightly uprest.
3717639	3720501	That sound you heard in the background, that was crickets chirping.
3720521	3721502	We have a soundboard for that.
3721642	3722243	That was me blinking.
3750717	3755960	TigerClaw in our chatroom talking about 3D, by the way, says 3D TVs are way behind in the 3D technology.
3756340	3760902	Theaters now are using polarized lenses, which doesn't need to use the shutter glasses technology.
3761322	3764044	In other words, you don't have to recharge the glasses to watch 3D.
3764144	3771988	Exactly, and that's what I'm saying they need to fucking do with those damn TVs, because those glasses are like $5 or free if you steal them from the movie theaters.
3773174	3773975	You're not stealing them.
3773995	3775455	You're paying the premium for them anyway.
3775475	3777116	They're just asking you to recycle them.
3777497	3778497	They can go fuck themselves.
3778537	3779938	I'm paying for those damn glasses.
3780298	3780578	Actually.
3780779	3786042	But they're still going to charge you the full theater price when you bring in, whether or not you bring in your own pair of 3D glasses, it seems like.
3786262	3788383	Actually, I thought it was a great suggestion.
3788423	3799050	One of my friends has suggested, after seeing Tron, you know, we should keep these glasses and we should, like, bling them out and, like, you know, bedazzle them and you'll put, like, pipe cleaner designs on them and all this.
3799350	3802131	So that way, you know, next time they try to hand you 3D glasses, oh, no, thanks.
3802412	3802952	I brought my own.
3804053	3808979	They have designer polarized glasses you can pay hundreds of dollars for.
3809440	3809720	Awesome.
3809740	3810021	Why?
3810501	3811002	You know what?
3811082	3817891	I actually hold onto those to wear over my glasses for when I go outside in the sun.
3818832	3819012	Nice.
3819052	3820693	Now, do those things work?
3821534	3824577	The 3D glasses for the theater, they don't work with the TVs, do they?
3824657	3825037	No.
3825057	3826839	That was what we were saying.
3827279	3828600	That's what I'm saying.
3828901	3837609	The only 3D technology they think that's worthwhile is the Disney one, just because it uses the polarized glasses, and...
3838249	3862846	or Nintendo's new technology which uses nothing at all exactly and they're actually they're looking to do TVs that way too which I think would you know really hurt your eyes but I think that the polarized glasses are it's a good alternative because in that way instead of saying yeah you gotta buy this 3D TV oh by the way if you want more than two people to watch that you're gonna need to buy another set of $100 glasses no thank you
3865070	3872900	Alright, well, so Zelda Skyward Sword, 2D, 3D, whatever D it's in, it's probably not coming out until December.
3873381	3873601	What?
3873981	3874903	Upward thrust.
3875563	3876184	Moving on.
3877205	3882192	Well, you know, Final Fantasy XIII came out for the Xbox 360 in Japan, and guess what?
3884707	3885507	That's how well it did.
3886568	3893412	It showed up at 39th in the software charts for Japan, which is really low.
3895333	3899615	So, yeah, they only sold... Well, I'll put it this way.
3899655	3902337	The game that made number 20 sold 22,579 units.
3902577	3903097	Yeah.
3906199	3910401	That's kind of... So it probably sold about 10,000 or whatever.
3910441	3910922	Something like that.
3910942	3912963	Wasn't that how many A360 owners there are in Japan?
3914797	3919879	Well, it's under 1.5 million users in Japan.
3920700	3924182	And keep in mind, the PS3 is close to 6 million.
3925582	3933947	So, basically, there were a lot of... Also because of how early Final Fantasy XIII came out in Japan.
3934427	3936988	And they thought it was only going to be for PlayStation 3.
3937308	3940350	So a lot of people bought a PlayStation 3 just to play Final Fantasy.
3941050	3950635	I was going to say, when I first kind of heard about this story earlier in the week, I had gotten into Double Take and said, I thought they specifically said they are not doing 360 Final Fantasy XIII in Japan.
3950675	3951836	So where the hell did this come from?
3952512	3953633	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3982627	4006024	and yeah I'm trying to watch this comparison to to see you know what the deal is and the Xbox 360 one actually kind of looks like poop in comparison oh no it doesn't they look the same I I think people look way too I think in order to see that level of detail you have to be a sitting as close to your TV as you're sitting next to your monitor right now you
4006424	4015273	Well, yeah, but I'm saying, you know, but also for people who have, you know, a really good HDTV, it's going to make a difference.
4015293	4019758	Like right now, the biggest thing is, now keep in mind, I also have an eye for it.
4020418	4021740	I'm seeing difference in color quality.
4021880	4024242	I'm seeing difference in line quality and draw, you know.
4025063	4027564	Yeah, but how much of that can be blamed on the fact you're watching a streaming internet video?
4027584	4029985	And that's why Final Fantasy XIII sucked.
4030245	4031845	No, Final Fantasy XIII's great.
4033086	4033346	It is.
4033566	4036987	I think it's a great game, and it's... I don't understand all this hatred.
4037227	4042148	Well, I do understand why people are hating on it, but trust me, I've played way worse games this past year.
4042168	4043169	Final Fantasy XIII doesn't even come close.
4043229	4044729	Well, no, I'm not saying it's at all bad.
4044749	4046089	That would be Final Fantasy XIV.
4046190	4047950	No, no, I... Yeah, yeah, seriously.
4048190	4048710	No, I know you're not.
4048750	4049150	I know you're not.
4049170	4053692	No, but keep in mind, Dan and I did the same thing with the Saturn and the PlayStation versions of Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
4054012	4054152	Mm-hmm.
4055479	4059901	We had the Saturn one and we listened to the two.
4060021	4061221	We watched both of them.
4061562	4063302	The Saturn version had better 2D.
4063863	4064583	Shitty 3D.
4065003	4067564	The Saturn version had better sound quality.
4068184	4071446	The PlayStation version had better load times.
4073326	4075007	I'm the kind that does this type of comparison.
4075447	4082070	Going back to the story at hand, because I kind of feel like the 360 PS3 debate on Final Fantasy XIII is like nine months old now since the game came out.
4082590	4083831	Going back to the story at hand...
4085011	4111996	I get the sense people in Japan didn't buy this game because A. they didn't know for the longest time that it was coming out and most people bought it on Playstation 3 thinking it was never coming out on the 360 and B. you don't have close to that same adoption ratio you have here in the US in Japan you're talking 6 Playstation 3's for every 1 Xbox 360 that's not even close to the ratio here which is not the reverse but it's a lot closer to 1 to 1 than that
4112737	4120684	And also, though, I have to look at it this way, too, is that we're dealing with Sony, a Japan-based company, and we're dealing with Microsoft, a US-based company.
4121605	4126189	I think they're going to know their markets a little bit better in their native area.
4126389	4127530	That's really my point.
4128271	4129953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4146574	4162405	and maybe they didn't want the same type of features that we do here so you start off with a less interested base and then you bring out a game however long after there's been another version out that's available to people who have the system so it's...
4163966	4166849	It's basically, I don't know why they expected it to do well.
4167950	4170692	I was going to say, I was hoping Final Fantasy XIII doesn't suck.
4170732	4172453	I just bought it, but I haven't started it yet.
4172734	4173554	It doesn't suck, by the way.
4173574	4173935	It doesn't suck.
4173975	4174375	It's great.
4174715	4176096	For the Xbox 360?
4176176	4176917	It doesn't suck.
4177057	4178158	It's just better on PS3.
4178799	4179619	I'll take your word for it.
4179639	4182942	And I don't even think it's negligible.
4183022	4184203	I don't think you would notice a difference.
4184623	4184824	Yeah.
4184844	4186825	I was going to say, what's the difference, honestly?
4187966	4189628	You have to disk swap on the 360 version.
4191624	4192064	You know what?
4192084	4193926	We had to do that on the PlayStation 2.
4194467	4195147	What kind of TV?
4195187	4196669	Do you have an HDTV that you play on?
4196849	4197129	Yes.
4197289	4199151	I have a Samsung.
4199351	4200432	You might notice a little bit.
4200712	4201092	Is it 1080?
4201293	4201673	Full 1080?
4201933	4202454	Or is it only 720?
4202774	4203134	It's 1080.
4204135	4207118	You might notice the hair is a little different.
4207578	4209460	It's an LED.
4209560	4212603	Basically, the big things you're going to notice is difference in color.
4213103	4216286	You won't notice any difference if you never see the PS3 version.
4216447	4217047	I'll put it that way.
4217888	4226756	But the big difference is that you're dealing with more jaggedies on more aliasing on the Xbox 360 version because the graphics processor is different.
4226776	4227877	The game was made for the PS3.
4228618	4229178	Thanks for watching!
4247608	4249310	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4268022	4270603	January, I mean, come on, it's not a big old release month.
4271864	4275706	Some cool stuff, though, coming out maybe a couple weeks, but not so much this week.
4276086	4284110	Lost in Shadow, though, on the Wii is making its way out, so that puzzle game from Hudson Soft kind of has a little bit of a Shadow of the Colossus vibe to it.
4284830	4285731	That'll be on the Wii.
4287492	4293915	And Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the Osborne House, that's on Nintendo DS.
4294075	4295756	Cool, you get to go to the Osborne's house?
4295776	4296416	Yes.
4296916	4297337	Yeah.
4297357	4298698	Sharon!
4299939	4301400	Not that Osborn house, I'm afraid.
4301420	4302040	Oh, boring.
4302881	4304562	Emergency 2012.
4308045	4312548	I'm assuming that you play some sort of emergency crew when the world is ending.
4312868	4315610	And yes, that looks about right, actually, so that's kind of cool.
4315951	4318572	It says, warning, the world as we know it is out of control.
4319273	4325798	As the head of all rescue operations, you must ensure to get the job done with fire and rescue services.
4326518	4330943	I don't think fire and rescue services are going to stop a tidal wave from wiping out a city.
4331583	4332985	I don't think that really works.
4333065	4333645	But they'll try.
4333985	4334966	They will try.
4336208	4338870	Hold back that wave with your axe there.
4340231	4344976	And then apparently Ghost Trick Phantom Detective is supposed to be out as well on Nintendo DS.
4345516	4346057	And that is it.
4346894	4348996	Traveling over to Japan this week.
4350177	4356243	Not this week, but next week is when you start to see some stuff on the 360 like Arcana Heart 3, but I guess I'll reiterate that next week.
4357184	4358365	So really nothing this week on the 360.
4359065	4361788	Going over to the PlayStation 3, kind of the same story.
4361808	4363269	There's not really a lot out there either.
4363329	4366913	I'm getting the sense it's going to be a very slow week.
4367794	4369956	Nintendo Wii, you don't even see anything until the end of the month.
4370056	4370977	That's the crazy stuff.
4371497	4374840	Saga 3, Jiku no Hasa, Shadow or Light Saga 3, Jiku no Hasa, Shadow or Light
4390576	4391477	A slot machine game you said?
4391497	4391597	Yes.
4391617	4391697	Yes.
4417571	4421272	You know, that would actually do really well over here to get into with the elderly market.
4422632	4423913	Can I talk about Europe now?
4424033	4424753	I guess you can.
4425273	4429154	Well, on the first, there was UFC Trainer.
4429194	4431175	Like, no one really gives a crap about that.
4431595	4433055	And on the fourth, Lost in Shadow.
4433116	4433696	And guess what?
4433956	4434456	That's it.
4435656	4436456	Very slow week.
4436516	4440118	But, you know, the holiday shopping fever is gone, so it kind of makes sense.
4440138	4440518	Jeez, people.
4441358	4443839	Besides, in two weeks, we got two great games on the PS3.
4444259	4445119	Isn't that ironic?
4446795	4450979	Alright, well, we've got a couple more stories for you guys in the Classic Game of the Week.
4451360	4452781	We'll close out Part A in just a moment.
4453038	4462326	Yes, one of the bitches that we had last year with Ubisoft was their really odd use of DRM.
4462986	4481042	They had a... Basically, you had to be connected to their servers the entire time while you're playing different games, and if for whatever reason you had some sort of connection problem, whether it be just a quick disconnect, your game would actually stop.
4481862	4484084	and you would have no opportunity to save or whatever.
4484824	4486165	It would just totally fuck you up.
4486185	4490847	And that was on even single player games like Assassin's Creed 2 or Splinter Cell Conviction.
4491848	4501493	Well, apparently though, there has been an update, I guess, that those DRM checks are a little bit easier now.
4502414	4507397	In fact, on games like Assassin's Creed 2 and Splinter Cell Conviction, for example...
4507857	4508638	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4526801	4528562	People don't want to deal with it, they won't.
4528742	4529922	That's the reality.
4529942	4535004	They got around it anyways, and all it really hurt was the people that bought the game originally.
4537986	4540847	But at least it's not as terrible.
4543208	4543548	Alright.
4544764	4545945	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4564386	4567749	ViaCom and MTV Networks have been an amazing home for the past four years.
4567769	4569370	Blah, blah, blah, fluff, fluff, fluff, right?
4569870	4573113	It's where we launched Rock Band and Dance Central, Beatles, Green Day, blah, blah, blah.
4573473	4578357	We're excited to be returning to our roots as an independent and privately owned studio.
4578878	4582381	And what this means, the DLC schedule marches on for Rock Band.
4582741	4588926	We will continue our support of previously released titles, and we're hard at work at some unannounced projects that we think you're going to be pumped about.
4589546	4613179	and the other half of this it wasn't in the press release but it was confirmed they are keeping the licenses for Dance Central and Rock Band they will get to if they decide to make Rock Band 4 or Dance Central 2 I think at least one of those is a sure thing I would honestly say I don't think Rock Band 4 is a sure thing at this point I think Harmonix might do something new with the whole plastic instrument thing but they may not call it Rock Band
4614423	4641415	and I think that's okay I think sometimes your series needs a swift kick in the pants so I would be quite okay with that I'd be okay with Dance Central 2 I would be totally okay with Dance Central 2 and I think that's a sure thing of course there's going to be a Dance Central 2 absolutely it was clearly the biggest game on Kinect I'm so happy we took down the tree today the Christmas tree so that we were able to move the coffee table out from the middle of the room again so now I have Kinect space again hooray congratulations there you go
4641895	4644037	So there it is, Harmonix going independent.
4644498	4650343	That's kind of an obvious resolution that none of us had guessed previously.
4650904	4662374	You kind of think, oh, when people are talking about selling a company, it's like you never really think that, hey, they could just buy themselves because they probably have a lot of money, right?
4663295	4664356	Well, good luck to Harmonix.
4664496	4666598	I'm hoping it'll pay off for them.
4666618	4666919	We'll see.
4667399	4677089	Anyway, let's take a minute not to talk about the future or this year, the coming year, but to reflect on the past and gaming's history and how we all got here to 2011 in gaming.
4677490	4679432	It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
4680643	4681204	DarkSakura.com
4697819	4698459	Hard Drivin'.
4699820	4701180	As in the nap machine.
4702181	4703941	I will go into why it's the nap machine later.
4704041	4707463	So forget all this need for speed stuff.
4708183	4710644	Listen to those really great sound effects.
4710764	4711544	Bong, bong.
4711584	4712244	Listen for a minute.
4714005	4716226	That's about as much music as the game has as a drum roll.
4719327	4720007	Serious.
4720027	4724069	We'll listen to some squeaking brakes as we listen to DarkSakura tell us about this game.
4724560	4732587	Hard Drivin' was basically, it was toted, according to this poster, as the world's first authentic driving simulation game.
4733207	4737191	It was the first 3D polygon driving environment.
4737271	4738712	It used a simulated cabinet.
4739092	4742315	Virtual reality, oh my god, Lawnmower Man, it's real.
4742815	4745838	And it was all on custom hardware.
4747516	4757605	Force Feedback, Car Physics Simulator, and most of the design was done by some dude named Max Behensky, so that's pretty cool.
4759026	4764811	Now, also keep in mind that other games that came out around this time, like Pole Position and Outrun, were sprite-based scaling.
4768747	4769848	Ah, you found the best part.
4770328	4772490	The instant replay, trying to call up that loop.
4772530	4785140	Basically, instead of having the sort of artificial graphics where the car wouldn't land the right, you know, right side up, or, you know, it actually used very realistic physics in the game.
4785540	4791665	When you went too far off track, you would crash, your skin, your skin, your windshield would crack.
4792926	4797570	You could keep driving, and then it also gave you the replay where you would die.
4799528	4800369	and a hideous car fire.
4800609	4802451	But you gotta admit, some of it's a little janky.
4802511	4805615	Like the car explodes and then suddenly in the next frame it's back together.
4806836	4807797	It's very jank.
4807897	4810600	We are very spoiled by today's graphics.
4810880	4813603	Keep in mind, this was 1988 and this was a Polygon game.
4814104	4814364	In 1988.
4817007	4819089	Wow, car explosions do not work that way.
4819565	4820306	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4840918	4843519	It has, um, also you can play it in automatic.
4843539	4847940	You also have a realistic manual transmission with a clutch and everything.
4848380	4850841	You can stall the car when you miss shift.
4851702	4854042	And, you know, like I said, force feedback and everything.
4854162	4856683	So it's meant to be a driving simulator.
4857423	4862325	And, you know, this game was pretty crazy for its time.
4862945	4863745	Thanks for watching!
4879187	4907287	so as far as sequels that came out there was Race Driving in 1990, Hard Drivin' 2 Drive Harder that came out on the yeah, on the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga an unreleased one called Hard Drivin' Airborne in 1993 and then Street Drivin' that came out in 2001 on the GameCube, Playstation 2 and Xbox different versions came out Hard Drivin' 3, now it's hard
4910069	4911710	HardDrivin4 in my pants.
4912070	4923638	Now, this that I'm going to quote on here is that the engine, transmission, control, suspension, and tire physics were modeled in conjunction with Doug Milliken, who was listed as a test driver in the game credits.
4924459	4926680	So, that's actually pretty cool.
4927000	4939609	It says that his father, William Milliken of Milliken Research, led a team at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in Buffalo, New York that converted aircraft equations of motion into equations of motion for the automobile.
4940429	4945153	So it was a, you know, they actually used real science in it, which I thought was pretty cool.
4945173	4946614	It was meant to be a real simulator.
4948771	4957978	As far as Easter eggs in the game, one of the buildings along the speed course has a sign above the door that says The Hut.
4960540	4969247	If you made a hard left turn at the start of the game, you have a secret track, which is a long straight road that leads to a very short circular track around a tower.
4969987	4973630	If you slow down and stop in front of one of the buildings, a keyhole appears in the building door.
4973950	4974170	What? !
4975431	4981376	Running into a cow will cause a moo sound to be played, at least in the Sega Genesis port there's exactly one cow.
4983857	4984518	And carefully.
4985358	4991683	After getting a sufficiently high score, then you get a full course race against the Phantom Photon on the stunt track.
4993157	4993777	That's pretty cool.
4994678	5002641	But now I have to tell you about... Now I'm going to put a picture of the cabinet in the chat room for a reason.
5003141	5004121	For a specific reason.
5004681	5007843	This thing had a chair that would swivel out.
5009363	5011584	And inside it was very dark.
5012144	5020547	So one day when I was working at Cyber Station at Bel Air Mall in Mobile, Alabama, there was nobody in the damn mall.
5021107	5022248	It was Tuesday morning.
5022941	5024842	I had been up all night, so guess what I did?
5026163	5032326	I sat my happy butt inside the chair at hard driving, wheeled myself in, and I took a three-hour nap.
5034928	5037349	Well, you know, not like a full-on nap.
5037629	5038589	I could still hear people.
5039230	5040811	No one came in.
5042222	5043524	I got all my other stuff done.
5044064	5046487	And I sat in the hard driving machine and took a three hour nap.
5047569	5048330	It was dark.
5048410	5049331	The chair was comfortable.
5049351	5051513	How colossally irresponsible of you, but funny.
5051594	5052274	Oh, please.
5053196	5053416	I was 19.
5055158	5060224	So, but at any rate, that's my story about the hard driving cabinet.
5060464	5061506	It's the great nap machine.
5062031	5066193	The game actually, I'll be honest, I don't like playing Hard Drivin'.
5066313	5067013	It's hard.
5067273	5069134	And time has not treated it well.
5069674	5070314	No, it hasn't.
5071135	5074396	But it's notable for what it is.
5074716	5077758	I gotta click on this link because there's a YouTube suggestion here.
5078178	5081199	The worst Genesis game ever made, Hard Drivin'.
5081219	5084200	I just want to remind myself how fucking terrible this is.
5084220	5086941	Okay, I don't want to hear some asshole talking about it.
5086961	5088002	I just want to see it here.
5088462	5092824	Oh yeah, with the crazy-ass drawing on the thing.
5092844	5095304	Oh my god, the frame rate on here is so awful.
5095384	5096665	It's hideous, it's hideous.
5098225	5103727	But I mean... God, can you imagine that somebody somewhere actually dropped like $50 on this game?
5103767	5104047	I know.
5104368	5106568	It's one freaking track, right?
5106748	5108129	You missed the cow, Rob!
5108169	5108869	You missed the cow!
5110790	5114171	Well, I'm going to burn in hell for all eternity for missing the damn cow.
5114565	5120009	I like Test Drive 3, and it came out around the same time, looked very similar to this.
5120089	5122830	They came out after this.
5123131	5123411	Yeah.
5123711	5128074	You also have the race other cars, and I used to try to take a shortcut by driving off-road.
5129055	5134638	Not something a performance high-speed vehicle is meant to do, but I did encounter lots of deer.
5135259	5135439	Deer.
5135459	5135559	Deer.
5136195	5137796	Rob's looking at the Commodore 64 right now.
5137876	5140177	Yes, Commodore 64 hard driving.
5140358	5141218	I have to see this.
5142179	5142679	Wow.
5142979	5145781	It's like two colors.
5146321	5148042	And this frame rate is awful.
5149023	5149723	Oh, wow.
5149863	5153465	You could go old playing this game.
5153566	5155066	Okay, I know this is terrible radio.
5155086	5155887	Just link it in the chat room.
5156007	5156968	Imagine you're playing.
5157008	5157688	I'll link it in the chat.
5157708	5158669	But for those listening on the podcast.
5158689	5159529	At least the screen breaks.
5159769	5162411	Imagine you're playing hard driving on the Game Boy.
5162711	5164192	I worked in a video store when this game came out.
5164212	5165713	It did pretty well in sales.
5189907	5192428	because it's virtual reality, man.
5193068	5193868	It's crazy.
5193948	5195568	Wave of the future.
5197629	5198069	Or something.
5198389	5198989	At any rate.
5199329	5199889	At any rate.
5201729	5204310	Like I said, I'm not a fan of the game itself.
5205130	5207471	However, I will give it... You're a big fan of naps.
5208091	5208851	I love naps.
5210711	5214252	But I will give it props for what it is and what it did at the time.
5215592	5218913	If not for hard driving, we may not have Ridge Racer.
5220312	5221173	That's true.
5221513	5225435	This is the beginning of our 3D racing games right here.
5226616	5233880	Even though this game really hasn't been treated well with time and it's kind of shit now, without it, we wouldn't have some of the stuff we have today.
5234140	5237922	Because people like to do loopy loops and jumpy jumps.
5238162	5241404	I just figured I took so many damn naps in the machine, I may as well play it a couple of times.
5242945	5244426	And I'll tell you something else that's funny.
5245106	5247308	I want to talk to other people who have worked in an arcade.
5248408	5250569	We got an allotment of 25 tokens a week.
5251490	5255111	Tell me, once you started working at the arcade, did you just stop using your damn tokens?
5255171	5256612	Did you not play anything for a while?
5257112	5258253	Because you were tired of being there.
5258673	5262695	When I quit, Rob, seriously, I had 600 and something tokens.
5263535	5264616	I played a lot of skeeball.
5265436	5266437	And a lot of Street Fighter Alpha 2.
5267737	5271139	Fifth dream in our chatroom says, VR without glasses.
5271439	5273920	Without glasses sound like anything recent?
5276243	5276944	I see what you did there.
5277804	5282509	All right, that may be a very topical and appropriate game of the week, all things considered.
5283069	5285191	It might be a lot crazier than you think.
5285271	5287353	Anyway, there it is, a classic game of the week.
5287613	5294179	Hard driving on various systems, but we're going to give it to the arcade because the arcade one can happen.
5294199	5295060	That's what I brought up.
5295360	5295700	That's right.
5296741	5298583	And definitely not the Commodore 64 version.
5298803	5299644	Definitely not that one.
5299966	5302327	Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
5302347	5303007	But don't go anywhere.
5303027	5303667	We're not done.
5303727	5305148	We've got plenty more show to go.
5305228	5311130	We're going to talk about Chrono Trigger, Super Meat Boy, Valve, Indie Games, the 3DS.
5311250	5313351	Yes, more, but we have some actual big news about it.
5313371	5317453	So we're going to talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5317593	5318153	So don't go anywhere.
5323851	5324131	DarkSakura.com
5340928	5341488	DarkSakura.com
5366249	5366750	DarkSakura.com
5386489	5405275	so check that out at our link in iTunes we don't really have a website yet working on it so search us in iTunes Horde House H-O-R-D-E space H-O-U-S-E or we are linked right there at OrangeLawnRadio.com we have a blog spot technically but that's just what we use to like link our feeds so we don't like don't take that too seriously
5406215	5407716	Anyhow, that's that.
5407776	5410817	Let's get into some quick news, some rapid news.
5410897	5414438	Believe it or not, there was still some stuff that happened in the gaming world this week.
5415178	5415538	Really?
5415738	5416599	Yeah, believe it or not.
5416799	5417339	A few things.
5417679	5418819	Christmas doesn't stop everything.
5419240	5419900	Yeah, not everything.
5421380	5427843	So it was announced this week that Pokemon Black and White will be headed over to North America on March 6th.
5428383	5431644	You'll be able to play with your Pokemans on that date.
5432324	5434485	And of course, the two versions will
5434565	5440106	We'll have slightly different themes to them I guess this time.
5440906	5458750	The black version will offer Pokemon looks like a Reshirium and a setting called Black City while white will contain a lush green area called White Forest and will let you capture a Pokemon named Zekrom.
5459390	5462711	Boy, they're having to get creative with the alphabet soup on these Pokemon names, aren't they?
5462731	5463591	Pokemans!
5465981	5473332	So those are actually going to be coming March 6th on the Nintendo DS.
5475094	5480002	Also, not really coinciding with that, but next month...
5481022	5487627	There's going to be some Pokemon downloads available at GameStop and Toys R Us.
5488147	5494051	This is actually happening between January 30th and February 5th at Toys R Us.
5494071	5504077	You're going to be able to pick up, I guess, Ash's Pikachu version of that character with a special set of abilities at Toys R Us.
5506297	5508658	I guess he starts off at a level 50.
5510198	5510999	Cool, I guess.
5512059	5519861	Some other stuff you can check out, of course, at GameStop during different weeks.
5519961	5522122	They're going to have different Pokemon you can download.
5523482	5526083	January 3rd through the 9th, they have Raikou.
5527763	5556029	17-23 Entei 31-6 Suicin That means nothing to me, by the way, because I don't play Pokemon, nor do I understand what any of these really flamboyant, slightly mythological creatures that almost looks like a dog
5557372	5562894	But if you want to be the very best, like no one ever was, you gotta catch them all.
5565095	5566095	It's like STDs.
5566575	5567916	To train them is your cause.
5568776	5569837	Gotta catch them all.
5573078	5579380	Something that I'm not sure a lot of people may be wanting to catch, but... Do you think antibiotics could clear up a bad case of the Pokemans?
5581249	5587356	I'm on a strong dose of antibiotics right now and I have no urge to play Pokemon.
5588237	5589158	So, maybe.
5591000	5601492	Dynasty Warriors 7 is coming to North America March 22nd and it will be, I guess, the first version that will include 3D and move support, of course, on the PlayStation 3.
5603633	5606454	and I guess the game will also be on Xbox 360 as well.
5606934	5609575	Some new stuff that's going to be in the game.
5609615	5613676	Apparently they have a free roam mode dubbed Chronicle Mode.
5614056	5620258	There's going to be 60 playable characters and I believe online co-op is the other brand new thing.
5622179	5645509	so yay and then last but not least as a lot of games seem to kind of go this route Devil Summoner Soul Hackers is a game that I guess came out in the Saturn back in Japan in 1997 it has not been released over here in North America or has gotten an English release anywhere in the world I remember that game
5646337	5658993	So now, a group of hackers calling themselves Devil Hackers They're actually working on a fan-made translation of the title for the PSP
5660777	5666022	And of course, they have a teaser trailer for it, but it's like 13 minutes long.
5666442	5667804	So that's a big tease.
5667824	5669185	That's a long trailer, geez.
5669305	5670206	That is a long trailer.
5670926	5671567	I remember that game.
5672007	5675731	I mean, do we really need to watch a trailer of like, hey, look, the game's in English now.
5675931	5677773	I mean, I don't know.
5678433	5678914	You know what?
5678994	5683398	I hadn't heard about this game until tonight, so maybe some people just need to know about its epic epicness.
5685371	5705931	Hey, speaking of epic, Rock Band is a very epic music game and there's an epic musician coming to the game this week and it doesn't get any better than Johnny Cash, ladies and gentlemen, coming this week to Rock Band and it's a big pack of eight songs that you can get for about, what is that, 1080 Microsoft points?
5706331	5708232	It's about 14 bucks and all said and done.
5708612	5709653	Cry, cry, cry.
5709733	5711034	Don't take your guns to town.

5721619	5722700	It needs a boy named Sue.
5723900	5725121	That has the best line in it.
5725361	5727703	Also, if that wasn't good enough, DarkSakura, get this.
5728203	5730104	Free songs coming out this week.

5747652	5748192	Free is free.
5748252	5749392	You might find some music you like.

5758975	5763016	Our friend has brought over the guitar, the pro guitar.

5763416	5763816	What'd you think?
5764336	5765477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
5782944	5790207	If you like Rock Band 3 and you like Fallout 3, then this song is for you.
5790347	5792028	It's on the Rock Band Network.
5792048	5793549	You're going to have to dig for this one a little bit.
5794229	5799151	It's Kirby Crackle doing the Fallout tribute song, Vault 101.
5799451	5804794	And that's a little play on where you start in the game Fallout 3.
5804894	5808675	That's available on the Rock Band Network store, so if you like that song.
5809256	5811877	There's a clip of it available on YouTube if you want to check it out.
5813177	5816759	Rock Band isn't the only game getting some download stuff coming.
5816819	5818359	Dance Central is still kicking.
5818899	5819720	It is still going.
5820080	5823361	In fact, actually, it came out a couple weeks ago, but we were off for the holidays.
5824562	5825122	Let's see.
5826142	5828483	Rihanna came out with Disturbia.
5829563	5831264	Girls and Boys by Blur.
5831604	5832285	That's kind of cool.
5833145	5834525	And Janet Jackson with Control.
5835526	5835846	Awesome.
5837286	5839967	Would you dance to Girls and Boys and Dance Central, Dark Sakura?
5839987	5840808	I know you like your Blur.
5842945	5843806	Super Meat Boy
5866584	5867304	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5891018	5894680	Well, A, I think it was that Nintendo was really the first to announce it.
5894720	5897561	It's not that they were designing specifically for the Wii to begin with.
5897861	5899922	They were just making a game and Nintendo kind of wanted it.
5900562	5903063	And B, you know what?
5903083	5903743	The game grew bigger.
5905084	5905984	And it's a great game.
5906604	5910266	And if you own a Wii, you probably have a PC somewhere in your house.
5910846	5913547	Even if you don't have a 360, at least you can get this game somewhere.
5913587	5918849	The game will not be coming out on the PlayStation 3 due to an arrangement with Microsoft.
5919009	5919310	Hmm.
5920790	5922531	You can kind of read between the lines there.
5924333	5924813	DarkSakura.
5944486	5954332	Then we have new characters for Tekken Tag Tournament 2 There's a Luchadora And they don't know her name But she's pink!
5955293	5964459	She's wearing a wrestling mask She makes me think of Rainbow Mika And it's a she Yeah So maybe they're taking a page from Capcom's book
5966073	5982105	and then in other news there's actually a few more things that are sort of cementing in that the previously rumored Taskmaster Akuma and Sienko are going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and that's in the way of Xbox 360 achievements
5984006	5993216	There is one called For Those Who Dwell in Darkness, and so that's going to be a team composed of all Darkstalkers characters, so that means three characters.
5994117	5996759	So there's going to be another Darkstalker.
5996939	6001584	So far we just have Felicia and Morrigan, so all the rumors are going to Sienko.
6002025	6006489	And then there's one called Fate of the Satsui no Hado, which is going to be...
6009173	6012314	Basically, the only other person that Ryu could fight would be Akuma.
6012654	6016575	Because that's the only person in game canon that would have that going on.
6017055	6018856	Unless you count Marvel superheroes.
6018976	6022656	What about the guy that's from Super Street Fighter 4?
6022716	6027418	The one that was... What was it?
6028578	6029998	Not Shenlong or whatever.
6030458	6031619	Oh, Gokent.
6033411	6034513	No, not Goken.
6034553	6036476	Like, it was another character.
6036716	6038438	It wasn't Akuma or whatever.
6038458	6040581	It was supposed to be their... Yeah, Goken.
6040842	6041162	Yeah.
6041503	6042704	Their sensei, that's Goken.
6042905	6045849	Yeah, and he doesn't follow that.
6046450	6046550	Oh.
6047742	6049563	because he's hardcore badass and has cool music.
6050324	6055667	And then the other one, of course, the rumor is Taskmaster, who I'm like, dude, he's not even relevant.
6055707	6056388	Why put him in it?
6056488	6063993	But I guess, but there's supposed to be more going on with that one.
6064773	6068056	They also said there's another list of achievements.
6068156	6069897	Among those are who will answer the call.
6070637	6075481	And this achievement is participate in eight player lobby on Xbox Live.
6075561	6077202	So there's going to be lobbies.
6079522	6084423	So we also get the Sentinel and Hagar are also rumored to be in it.
6085083	6087644	I'm just happy that X-23 is in it.
6089444	6090424	That's it.
6090444	6092785	Sounds like a definite purchase for you then, DarkSakura.
6093405	6094365	Hell yeah!
6094445	6095425	The minute it was announced.
6095565	6099186	It doesn't even matter what characters are in it.
6099246	6102647	I am sick of Deadpool in the comics, but I love everything else that has Deadpool in it.
6102667	6103287	Does that make sense?
6104247	6104347	No.
6104795	6105176	That's okay.
6105537	6107221	All right, let's get to the Twitters.
6108043	6109326	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6109386	6114298	Every week we ask you to show us your tweets, and we will respond to them here on the program.
6115762	6120243	We're going to start tonight with a tweet from Nathan Jackson on Twitter.
6120383	6121584	Question for OLR.
6121924	6127226	Is the Kinect going to fundamentally change gaming to the point of abandoning controllers completely?
6128306	6130507	I'm going to give that a big fat no.
6131207	6133688	Because some people like to touch things.
6133968	6134628	They like that.
6135008	6141950	And funny enough, I think that's all kind of part of Sony's marketing campaign is that sometimes people want tangible things.
6142571	6142751	But...
6144031	6145732	Here's case in point.
6146253	6153918	There's only so much of the iPhone gaming I can take because I don't have those tangible buttons and the responsiveness isn't always there for me.
6153938	6159562	I think they seriously need to... Aren't they supposed to be unveiling new stuff soon or something?
6159943	6162525	I think Macworld's coming up this month.
6162685	6168369	Because, I mean, they seriously need some sort of controller thing or something because it would really help.
6169540	6172101	But, you know, will it change gaming?
6172362	6172722	Sure.
6172982	6176504	I mean, this type of technology has been slowly coming at us ever since the Wii.
6176884	6181886	I mean, what you're seeing with the Kinect is really just an evolution of something we've kind of seen before.
6182327	6183547	And it will evolve again.
6184008	6188170	So is the Kinect here to stay in gaming culture?
6188530	6188750	Sure.
6189430	6192312	But is it going to eliminate what you know of games today?
6192712	6192992	Nah.
6193453	6194573	Not until we have the holodeck.
6194793	6195694	Once the holodeck's here...
6196516	6197256	Then it's all over.
6197276	6205640	Because remember, and I've said this on the show a lot, everything we do with every generation is bringing us one step closer to the holodeck for reals.
6207580	6210742	Once gaming reaches the holodeck, we're on the last generation of gaming.
6212462	6213783	Even then, there might be a holodeck 2.0, huh?
6213923	6215144	I don't know.
6215764	6216984	All right, let's see.
6217004	6218305	Moving on with some other tweets.
6219705	6220686	I'm going to...
6222816	6224678	DJ Ranma S sends us a tweet.
6225578	6226019	Interesting.
6226039	6233245	EA is being sued by gamers because of the football license exclusivity that they have.
6233285	6235867	That's the story that he's linking us to.
6236487	6238609	I thought I heard about this before.
6239790	6266832	maybe something has progressed with this I could have sworn I heard something about this before but it was like years ago but anyway whatever let's see they're saying we believe EA forced consumers to pay an artificial premium on Madden NFL video games we intend to prove that EA could inflate prices on their sports titles because these exclusive licenses restrain trade and competition for interactive sports software because you know when NFL 2K5 came out it was only 20 bucks
6268053	6294283	and EA had to sell Madden 2005 at $30 and then once the exclusive deal hit, well shit, those games have just cost like $60 since then they want anybody who's purchased an EA football game since August 2005 to get damages in this settlement, which if it ends up being this whole class action thing means every person will probably get $0.50 hope you retained all your proof of purchases for these 5 year old games good luck
6295902	6297863	By the way, yeah, I knew this was old.
6297923	6299923	It was originally filed in mid-2008.
6300964	6305985	But what's new about it, a judge has recently allowed this lawsuit to proceed.
6306826	6308306	I thought I'd heard about this before.
6308326	6309527	It was just that long ago.
6310207	6311187	But it's moving forward.
6311207	6313748	It wasn't laughed out of court, so that could be interesting.
6316109	6322811	Story for us from TigerClaw305 about the Galaga world record attempt.
6324505	6334392	Let's see, Andrew Laidlaw of Washington State has claimed the Galaga record and he did it on New Year's Day.
6334912	6342657	4,525,150 points as certified by Twin Galaxies because you know, they carry the spirit stick and what they say goes.
6342797	6344959	So they are the authority on video game high scores.
6345559	6352746	That was a record taken from Phil Day, who set a 3.2 million record in November of 2009.
6354067	6358511	He said, quote, the first time was magical in a way, this time it's a huge relief.
6359292	6360453	Well, congratulations.
6360613	6363136	A lot can be said about sex that way.
6364696	6368781	I was gonna say, you know, ability to perform under stress.
6368801	6370263	I don't know.
6370603	6371925	Oh, you crazy kids.
6371965	6373307	That's gonna do it for the tweeters tonight.
6373367	6376030	Tyra Claw linked us another story, but it's coming up a little later in the show.
6376110	6382158	And also Spazinator is not enjoying the changes to the feed because he's not able to tune in.
6382558	6386420	Remember guys, allgames.com is really the best place for you to tune in.
6386460	6387741	It is HTML5 compliant.
6387781	6390242	I think the only people that are getting screwed are the PSP people.
6390522	6393564	Because I'm not sure the PSP browser supports the HTML5.
6393644	6396665	So hopefully there will be a solution for you guys soon.
6397005	6400087	But yeah, there's a lot of change-a-roonies going around at All Games Radio.
6400747	6422878	from what I understand not bad stuff just you know kind of new year new stuff out with the old in with the new so some of the shows that are no longer around they're going to be replaced with some new live shows so you know nice to have some new stuff going on so with that comes streaming changes etc etc so hopefully they get all that worked out in the next couple weeks and then we can update all our fun little PSP stuffs and get everybody back on board
6423618	6425700	Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news.
6425780	6427182	The mailbag is coming up in a little bit.
6427222	6430825	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, FUs of the Week, and of course the Skype line.
6431025	6431926	But first, some more news.
6433167	6433408	Oh yeah.
6434246	6435907	Good stuff.
6436508	6439190	So this is kind of neat.
6439250	6443493	Valve is pretty kind of on the cutting edge with different things.
6444253	6445974	They definitely put out a lot of popular games.
6446335	6455261	And, of course, one of the things that they actually have interest in doing is providing better experiences for those who may be disabled.
6456081	6460525	For example, one of the things that they're looking to do is with eye tracking.
6461105	6462006	This would provide...
6462566	6476174	Ways for people that, for example, don't have full body movement to be able to play without having to use their hands or their entire body as an input device.
6477054	6485099	And it says, it may be possible in the future to let the eyes act as the proxy for the mouse cursor, letting gamers transmit navigation data.
6485659	6487800	and targeting inputs via eye movements.
6488020	6499126	If you couple this with the use of blinks and other proxies for button presses, you may remove the need for a mouse and keyboard or gamepad altogether.
6500386	6501287	So that's pretty cool.
6504085	6505546	So, break this down for me.
6505586	6507227	How exactly is that going to work?
6508388	6512271	They're going to have some sort of way to track where your eyes are looking.
6513052	6523480	And basically, they're going to have some sort of system in place where, for example, like say, if I blink my eyes a certain way or something, like a double blink or something like that, that it will...
6523820	6524361	Steven Hawking Games
6540687	6545229	But wasn't it... I want to say it's Atari, but I'm not 100% certain.
6545249	6547049	It had this thing called a psychic controller.
6547509	6550790	Really, all it did was control... The mind... Thingy.
6551391	6552431	I can't remember the name of it.
6552451	6553611	Somebody in chat will yell it out.
6553731	6559493	But it really just used the movement of the forehead and blinking of the eyes to do the control.
6560173	6564855	It's the same concept, but now that the technology has caught up that it could actually be...
6565775	6569378	or track your retinas like, you know, an ultra fine connect.
6569658	6570238	Oh, certainly.
6570959	6574962	I mean, I think that the technology has come up well enough to make it something viable now.
6576723	6579025	You know, I'd hate to have that with somebody with epilepsy.
6580466	6581227	You know, that wouldn't work.
6582167	6583428	But it's a neat concept.
6584009	6592755	And especially though, with, well, I was thinking, you know, there's other uses for head tracking out there, but that's really, I think, innovative.
6592975	6593956	A good, a good thought.
6595866	6597788	I'm all about making games more accessible.
6598309	6603774	I don't know if this stuff could ever replace, but if it helps enable and bring more people to the table, then hooray.
6604274	6605495	Then maybe people won't sue.
6607137	6607797	Well, you know.
6608378	6609899	People will sue about what they can sue.
6610600	6610880	All right.
6611621	6619988	Anyhow, oh, Ranma says in our chatroom at chat.orangelandre.com, I'm reminded of those special custom controllers Nintendo put out for disabled people to play their games.
6621410	6621550	Hmm.
6624045	6624386	Chrono Trigger
6640225	6640806	Yeah, that's right.
6640846	6646309	The old school Super Nintendo game is apparently coming back all over again.
6646389	6646850	Sit down.
6646890	6651993	It's not a sequel, but it's the inevitable mobile version of the game.
6652073	6656696	There's a teaser site up now on Squeenix's Japanese website.
6657216	6658457	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6685780	6687702	It probably will inevitably come out for the iPhone.
6689143	6690464	That was wordy, wasn't it?
6690524	6691705	Probably will inevitably, whatever.
6692646	6694407	It's probably going to come out for the iPhone at some point.
6694427	6695989	I just don't want to guarantee it because I don't know anything.
6696409	6698531	But, hey, Secret of Mana just came out on the iPhone.
6698571	6698951	Did you know that?
6698971	6699511	And the iPad?
6700012	6701693	I didn't like the way it controls, but that's just me.
6701853	6705637	Well, of course, because the controls on the iPhone suck.
6705897	6706097	Yeah.
6706117	6706197	Yeah.
6706317	6706898	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6728817	6730179	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6744196	6771694	Amiga777 in our chatroom says hope they don't abandon like they did for Agito oh that's right the Final Fantasy 13 remember that well keep in mind Amiga we haven't heard anything about Versus either so it could still be happening just later this year I have a feeling Final Fantasy 13 Versus is going to be the big thing we hear about at E3 this year from Squeenix at least in the JRPG camp because certainly they have the Tomb Raider reboot now isn't that weird that the Tomb Raider reboot is a Squeenix game now can we talk about this but
6772515	6773656	All the different camps there.
6774237	6779142	SalaciousPop in our chatroom says, they'll charge $9 for the ROM just like Secret of Mana for iOS.
6780163	6781364	$9 for an iOS ROM hack.
6782045	6784047	Well, hold on.
6784087	6786710	You could kind of read into that a couple ways.
6787250	6790594	Because I don't think it's really a ROM hack, but...
6790874	6796462	because they do have to adapt it for a different screen resolution, and they are putting those controls in it.
6796482	6798805	$9 is still a lot, though.
6798885	6800387	I mean, I hear you there.
6802250	6804233	But those games will inevitably come down in price.
6804453	6805795	It'll be $9 this month, $7 next month.
6808137	6835951	99 cents when there's a big sale and that's when I will finally get it at some point and I urge you to do the same thing Savalas in our chatroom says Angry Birds is amazing on iPhone, iPad, iTouch you know I still haven't played that game I've heard very mixed things on Angry Birds Angry Birds is frustrating and fun I've had it downloaded forever and I still have not played it and then like they taunt you with their little snort noises stupid green pigs
6837355	6838576	I played some iPhone games.
6838996	6840858	I played that Smurf Village game, finally.
6841378	6845581	And I played that dungeon crawler game that Loki gifted me a couple weeks ago.
6845641	6848944	And it was really pretty, but it was kind of hard to control.
6851525	6852846	Well, I mean, it's still really pretty.
6853647	6855048	It's probably better on the iPad.
6855148	6855408	I don't know.
6855448	6857830	For some reason, you're so cramped on the phone.
6857850	6860092	I would think on the iPad, you might have a little bit better...
6860876	6866802	Oh, I forgot to mention, they have Raptor Call of the Shadows on iOS now.
6867062	6867382	Oh, really?
6867402	6868984	Remember that old shareware game?
6869224	6869824	Oh, wow.
6870745	6871246	Wow.
6871946	6872767	How much do they want for that?
6874268	6874869	I wouldn't know.
6876751	6877031	All right.
6878072	6879453	Let's move on, DarkSakura.
6880134	6880474	Meat!
6882136	6883177	Meaty meat meat.
6884978	6885719	You're making me hungry.
6887656	6890337	Actually, Super Meat Boy is going to have some goodies coming out.
6890437	6891437	More beefy goodness.
6892757	6893757	Mmm, meat.
6895898	6910741	With the next update, and it's supposed to be a free PC update, there is going to be a level editor, an online level portal called Super Meat World, and something called Enter the Unknown.
6911301	6915102	But with the editor, you can basically go...
6916142	6916623	DarkSakura.com
6939844	6955662	Super Meat World is a big hub and it's what's gonna bring you new chapters to the game and it unlocks with 30 bandages and pops up on the map before the first chapter actually begins and
6956062	6981800	and then enter the unknown which is exclusive for the PC picks a random user made level and filters it based by whatever difficulty that you picked so basically it just is giving you a random player created level based on the difficulty that you've selected so pretty cool that's pretty cool that's interesting that whole like random esque ability
6982839	6983740	It's Mystery Meat.
6983780	6985401	That's what they should have called it was Mystery Meat.
6985461	6986181	Mystery Meat.
6986221	6986742	I like that.
6986822	6988503	We should trademark that today.
6990104	6991244	That sounds so wrong.
6991925	6992825	Super Meat Boy.
6993326	6996408	Worst title ever and worst.
6996548	6998049	Yeah, I've said this a million times on the show.
6998109	7001251	Worst little logo ever, but awesome game.
7001831	7002652	Bandage Girl.
7002672	7003432	Bandage Girl?
7003512	7004592	You've got to be kidding me.
7004712	7008314	I know we never did an appropriate top games of the year.
7008334	7009074	Dr. Fetus?
7009274	7010215	Oh my god.
7010415	7013656	But Super Meat Boy definitely would have been near my top of the list.
7015737	7017697	I'm showing Gary the beginning of the game.
7019018	7020839	This is real?
7020919	7021419	Wow.
7022099	7026401	Loki, dare I ask if you had to pick one game for your game of the year last year?
7027921	7028562	Is it possible?
7029283	7029783	Red Dead?
7029823	7030885	That's what everybody else picked.
7032566	7033347	Red Dead was alright.
7033788	7035670	I don't know.
7035730	7037292	I still play Grand Theft Auto though.
7038373	7039474	But Red Dead was kind of cool.
7039835	7042238	I don't know if I would say it's my game of the year though.
7044500	7044781	Maybe.
7046162	7046843	I can't pick one.
7048174	7050395	That's why we didn't even try to do that episode.
7050676	7051916	There was a lot of great games last year.
7052657	7053778	So we just took last week off.
7053938	7054458	Think about it.
7056600	7060122	I know a top contender for Game of the Year this year is going to be... Well, what do you think?
7060942	7063744	Earth Defense Force, Insect Overgeddon.
7064224	7065405	Oh, yeah.
7065505	7072430	But see, last year, I'm pretty sure I would have said on the end of the year episode, Oh, man, Final Fantasy XIV is going to be the best game of the year next year.
7073564	7074765	Boy, was I wrong!
7075685	7078567	I'm still going to say Star Trek Online was my game of the year.
7080349	7082390	Unfortunately, it was the game that only lasted me a year.
7084051	7091156	Mine was probably Civ V. You would say that.
7091436	7092057	Of course I would.
7093858	7097481	Anyhow, let's move on with some more news, Loki.
7097741	7099502	Then we've got the mailbag coming up in just a minute.
7099904	7104528	Xbox Live Indie Games Winter Uprising Indie Games Winter Uprising
7119562	7120923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7141900	7146842	and I believe now all the games have been released that are a part of that.
7148322	7160747	One of the few last ones here, Cthulhu Saves the World, apparently came out earlier last week and then also they had Breath of Death 7, which was the last one.
7160907	7163668	Cthulhu Saves the World, it looks like it was made with RPG Maker.
7166423	7172486	But yeah, you can check those out and check out the little link on Indie Games Winter Uprising.
7172626	7176227	Plus there's plenty of games out there that really need to be checked out.
7176407	7179449	And a lot of them, actually all of them, have free demos.
7181169	7181870	And they're cheap.
7182170	7183710	A lot of them are really cheap out there.
7183931	7185811	So check out the demos.
7186272	7187232	Buy the full game.
7190598	7193299	What are the huge indie games that I should be playing?
7193339	7194000	Do we know of any?
7194380	7200002	Because I tried a couple, and I've got to admit, nothing that really made me want to come on the show and talk about it.
7200042	7201583	Have you played Carnieville?
7202283	7202683	I haven't.
7203244	7204104	You've got to play Carnieville.
7204124	7206465	I was looking at that Breath of Death whatever, though.
7206485	7207566	I was going to download that.
7207606	7208486	I just didn't get around to it.
7208706	7214330	Carnivale Showtime is one of the first indie games I picked up and it's awesome.
7215291	7216692	So good.
7218214	7225699	It's kind of a game where you launch this clown ragdoll thing into the air and you collect balloons and stuff.
7227601	7228782	But it's really...
7230560	7231540	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7248626	7254509	It was some sort of like Obama fighting game or something like that.
7255130	7257031	It was, what the hell was it?
7257171	7259532	It was something ridiculous.
7259612	7270378	It was like some dude that was running around and like there'd be people and they're trying to attack you and you can like pick up a bus and smash them with the bus and
7271453	7272594	Oh, you showed me videos of that.
7272634	7273155	I remember that.
7273175	7274797	They looked like bad dudes or something.
7274877	7276078	It was pretty funny.
7276699	7278662	Are you a bad enough dude to be the president?
7280204	7280444	Nice.
7282266	7283428	Alright, what do you think of some others?
7284269	7284569	I don't know.
7284589	7286712	I haven't really been on indie games in a while, so...
7287773	7288193	Thanks for watching!
7303860	7308744	So the 3DS is getting a big public showing in February in Japan.
7308764	7312607	Let's see, 3DS will also be at the World Hobby Fair.
7312647	7314668	It's going to be at some Japanese shopping centers.
7315249	7317671	Crazy, crazy, excuse me, crazy stuff.
7318872	7325057	But here's some of the games that are going to be playable at this exhibition, Nintendo World 2011.
7325137	7327198	The new Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D.
7328659	7329940	Pro Evolution 3D Soccer.
7330301	7330861	Street Fighter 4 3D.
7332362	7339891	Resident Evil Revelations Dynasty Warriors Chronicle Dead or Alive Dimensions Ridge Racer 3D Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle Nintendogs Plus Cats
7347419	7356525	Kid Icarus Uprising, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D, Steel Diver, Pilotwings Resort, AR Games, and the Nintendo 3DS Camera.
7356825	7359326	Now, there's some other stuff that is not playable that's going to be shown.
7359667	7368452	Kingdom Hearts 3D, Super Monkey Ball 3D, Puzzle Bobble 3D, Star Fox 64, Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, so on and so on.
7368792	7372714	Probably the same shit we saw at E3, but maybe with a new coat of paint.
7372855	7373235	I don't know.
7373695	7374315	But, yep.
7375336	7378203	Very soon we will know how much this is going to cost in the US, by the way.
7378263	7379425	Most people are predicting it'll be $2.99.
7381167	7393834	I'm gonna say I agree with that $2.99 and the Zelda Ocarina of Time is the pack-in because it's a huge game without being a lot of money spent by Nintendo you know what I mean?
7394174	7405881	I think that'll be the pack-in game will be the camera, the Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D maybe some samplers with some of these other trailers and so stuff other stuff but it won't be Kid Icarus tell you that that will not be the pack-in game
7408439	7412900	Alright, and that's just, I have nothing to go off of, just what I think.
7413821	7415341	Let's get to what you think in the mailbag.
7415441	7419082	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a place to send your emails every week.
7419863	7424864	DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag and pick some of her favorite emails and read them for us here on the air.
7425184	7425564	I will.
7425704	7427405	But I think the holidays slowed people down, didn't it?
7427992	7428192	Yep.
7429413	7430033	This one.
7430473	7434475	The OLR 2010 Predictions Forum thread died early this year.
7434775	7435116	Dull.
7435256	7438577	We got next to nothing, and mine were all wrong, but thankfully so.
7439017	7440118	This is, by the way, from Rababa.
7441299	7443320	I won't be posting a 2011 thread this year.
7443440	7447001	I would like to mention a heavily self-biased list of some notable things that happened.
7447602	7449863	Don't include the stuff that was part of your year-end wrap-ups.
7450483	7451283	I'm going to do it anyway.
7451404	7453745	Well, we didn't even end up doing your year-end wrap-ups, so there you go.
7453925	7454105	Yeah.
7455406	7460950	2010 Slimeball Award, Activision Dismantling of Infinity Ward was so as not to pay bonuses.
7461010	7465634	Someone looking for another job while being gamefully employed is not a reason to fire them.
7466114	7471718	In fact, the games industry will be best served if you encourage career development across companies.
7472299	7474681	The decision was very profit-oriented and slimy.
7475341	7483588	One thing I hope the developer studios should have learned is to put in their contracts that bonuses are paid based on project, not employment.
7484828	7485849	2010 Last to the Party Award.
7486009	7486189	Me!
7486349	7489931	I joined Facebook in August.
7490191	7491451	2010 Developer of the Year, PopCap.
7491932	7494193	Their games are not hard-hitting, but they sure are fun.
7494253	7496794	PopCap is really good at breathing new life into old games.
7496854	7499075	Plant vs. Zombies on new systems with new features.
7499455	7501316	Bejeweled 3, Zuma's Revenge, and Zuma Blitz.
7502836	7504817	2010 Welcome to the 21st Century Award, Steam.
7505537	7509499	Steam made no-box direct sales of software worth it with their great prices.
7509919	7513401	Think you shouldn't pay as much for a game because the cost of packaging and media isn't an issue?
7513541	7514601	Steam understands that.
7515082	7519644	The newest games are pricey, but their sales, like the year-end one right now, make it affordable.
7521586	7523149	2010 best use of meat in a game's title?
7523249	7523850	Super Meat Boy.
7524391	7527437	They managed to use the initials SMB to hilarious effects.
7528198	7530142	I'm looking forward to what you guys come up with.
7534707	7535407	That's cute.
7536248	7536688	Last one.
7537568	7542931	Dear peoples of the intertubes, you put out the call on Twitter for gaming-related New Year's resolutions.
7543191	7545052	Well, most of my resolutions have to do with writing.
7545892	7552415	My only vaguely gaming-related one is to pay off my credit card, which I've only used to buy my two-year-old laptop.
7553055	7555477	Besides, I don't make resolutions as much as I make goals.
7555677	7558819	Goals tend not to have an expiration date that leads to disappointment in yourself.
7559220	7560420	Stay black, Redertainment.
7560961	7565984	This message was brought to you by Windows 7, which totally fucked up my two-year-old laptop sent for my iPad.
7568386	7570528	Well, you gotta have the money to buy the games, so...
7572428	7578952	Good old reliable iPad If you pay off your credit card, you can always run it all up again Just kidding You know what I have noticed?
7578972	7579713	Don't go too crazy What?
7580273	7583915	I have better luck sending emails from my iPhone than I do my PC sometimes Really?
7584055	7596763	Because my iPhone has never crashed on me Alright, well let's get to the FUs of the week I've had iPhone apps crash on me, just so you know I've had apps crash, but there's no such thing as a BSOD on an iPhone
7597734	7597954	Yet.
7598755	7602197	But there is a such thing as the alarms suddenly not working on the iPhone.
7602217	7603398	I don't know if you've heard about that.
7603458	7604979	So it's not a perfect world.
7605599	7606560	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
7622481	7632389	FU to my back and now my butt because I was playing with my friend's son and he's heavy.
7633410	7637853	And I've wrenched my lower back and it's settled in my right side.
7638414	7639635	I have a bad hip for the record.
7639655	7642937	I've been in two car accidents and injured my hip both times.
7643818	7646200	And I'm in a lot of pain.
7646300	7648321	I've taken significant Vicodin today.
7649222	7649823	Significant.
7650263	7650923	I won't say how much.
7652044	7653645	And, um, I still hurt.
7654485	7656246	I'm walking around like I'm, you know, 90.
7657687	7658467	And I don't like it.
7658767	7662289	Also, I F you to the tail end of this cold that refuses to go away.
7662669	7665970	Which makes me very, uh, antisocial and bitchy.
7670012	7670692	Is that all?
7672153	7672833	Okay, Loki.
7673674	7674794	What's your F you to the week, Loki?
7674814	7678416	Uh, my F you to the week would be to, um...
7680623	7682008	The weather sucks.
7683935	7684618	I don't really have anything.
7685562	7686823	Gary, any FUs of the week?
7686883	7688424	Things that are making you mad?
7689785	7693888	I would have to agree with Loki on that one.
7693908	7698451	The weather around here has blown goats all days yesterday and today.
7699011	7700913	I hate rain, but I've said that before.
7702614	7708057	I mean, other people remind me that yes, we need it, but still, it makes everything, especially with driving, more difficult.
7708978	7713341	And yeah, that's the only one I want to say right now.
7713621	7714222	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7729938	7734920	I would say F you to Comcast, my internet provider.
7735060	7735440	Yes.
7735940	7737021	Comcast is evil.
7737041	7739442	Because my internet is still dropping out.
7739462	7742123	I actually had a guy come out to my house last week to try to fix it.
7742183	7744303	Have fun.
7744503	7748605	And I'm still getting randomly dropped from the internet, which is affecting my Warcraft playing.
7749105	7749345	Addict.
7749625	7750125	Rawr.
7750505	7751026	Sorry.
7751386	7757528	Jamie and I have a mutual friend who has Comcast, and she's always complaining about issues with it, so I can feel your pain on that one.
7757788	7768273	Hey, at least the tech who came to my house was really nice, but I kind of got the sense in just what he was saying that, yeah, this seems to be a problem in Comcast's office, and I'm just really here to validate that there's a problem.
7768313	7770894	You know, like, so frustrating.
7770954	7774836	At least nobody came into your neighborhood and snapped the main fiber optic cable.
7775716	7776677	You remember when that happened to me?
7776857	7778138	Well, that's not Comcast, though.
7778158	7779059	That's just some jackass.
7779079	7779800	That's some asshole.
7779960	7780320	Yeah.
7781621	7783643	But anyhow, that's it for my FUs of the week.
7783803	7787747	Just FU to the fact I can't run instances in WoW because I always get disconnected.
7788427	7789228	Rude and ignorant.
7789926	7793909	A couple more news stories for you guys in the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR.
7793929	7794529	But not just yet.
7794569	7795810	We've got two more stories for you.
7795890	7796150	Loki?
7796951	7797211	Yes.
7798372	7803035	So to kind of wrap things up, and this is surprising.
7803116	7805898	Thank God I haven't run across it probably because it's in a different region.
7806338	7818747	But Android, the marketplace, is getting a few games that are actually Trojan horses that are letting, I guess, malicious hackers possibly use your phone as part of a botnet.
7819608	7826478	Um, apparently in China, um, on their app store, there's, I guess, um, a few apps that are affected by this.
7826838	7832867	Monkey Jump 2, Sex Positions, President vs. Aliens, and, um...
7835049	7837071	City Defense and Baseball Superstars 2010
7851339	7862427	Though the intent of this Trojan isn't entirely clear, the possibilities range from setting up a malicious mobile ad network to creating an Android botnet.
7864889	7870773	Possibly affected apps could be posted to the app stores targeting US users in the future.
7872478	7874521	So just be on the lookout.
7877545	7880208	I worry about the day something like this happens to the iPhone.
7880228	7881270	I mean, Android's bad enough.
7881290	7882351	There's enough people who use that.
7882391	7884654	But boy, oh boy, when something like this happens on iPhone.
7884674	7886597	I think their app store is more open than...
7887498	7888119	That's true.
7888199	7891542	I mean, everything does have to go through that rigid approval process with Apple.
7891682	7894344	But you just wonder when something's going to slip through the cracks, you know?
7894445	7895305	It will eventually.
7895325	7895646	Yeah.
7896106	7898068	Of course, they can always pull it like that.
7898088	7898749	Like the cocaine app?
7898809	7899549	Once it gets out there.
7900530	7901211	Remember the cocaine app?
7901231	7901831	I heard about that.
7901971	7902512	Yeah, yeah.
7902972	7904013	Or the... What was the one?
7904053	7907236	Something about like baby... Oh, it was really bad.
7907276	7910159	It was something like punching babies or something and somehow it got approved.
7910179	7911000	It was really terrible.
7911660	7911801	So...
7912341	7913523	The Legend of Zelda The Legend of Zelda
7929963	7931864	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7945194	7945715	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7966476	7967036	Rob, what's that?
7967076	7967757	I'm downloading it.
7994089	7994690	Of course you are.
7995090	8021373	It is available on this website called, let's see, it was originally put on this forums at lostlevels.org which I think gets into a lot of these types of prototype issues and I guess there's more information available as well on a website called thecuttingroomfloortcrf.net which is a whole little like Wikipedia type thing that will detail all of the changes if you really want to know what rooms led different rooms and
8021633	8023134	How the item drops were different.
8023174	8026536	I mean, they get into the real nitty gritty about this.
8026836	8029718	Most people will just kind of go, eh, neat, a couple things are different.
8030478	8044526	So, you know, again, if you're going to download stuff like this, though, you should consider, you know, at least owning a legitimate copy of this, be it through Virtual Console or one of the 50,000 times Nintendo has released these games, be it in compilations or what have you.
8046547	8047588	But I say, you know what?
8049111	8054693	As long as you have one of those other games or you've had at some point in your life, I think you're entitled to take a peek at this game.
8056693	8059174	Alright, that is it for the news tonight.
8059394	8060734	We're going to open up the Skype line.
8061294	8062095	Let's get some calls.
8062115	8065776	877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8065816	8066436	First calls of 2011.
8066496	8071197	The delay is bigger tonight, so it's about a minute.
8071617	8074118	Do we have any last minute stories while we wait for some calls to come in?
8074676	8075176	Try Not To Fart
8096531	8098573	I saw the box art for that.
8099613	8101475	How exactly do you not fart?
8101635	8102976	I think it's button presses.
8103016	8104517	You have to mimic the button presses.
8104877	8112322	But they have different situations, eating dinner with your girlfriend's parents or wedding.
8112562	8116265	I remembered one of the indie games that I played that was really, really bad.
8116305	8117966	It was called Maids with Balloons.
8118346	8119246	Oh I saw that!
8140172	8142673	Wow, it was kind of poop.
8143494	8150556	I know we're supposed to support indie games and all that stuff, but it's very clear what this game is all about, and it's not the game.
8150656	8151797	Sounds like an epic fail.
8152397	8156999	Yeah, Inside Lacrosse's College Lacrosse 2010.
8157139	8158179	That's a good one.
8158199	8160600	All right, let's get to the call.
8160640	8162041	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8162061	8162381	Who's this?
8163749	8167010	It's Ranma, and yes, SSJ100, Matt, is correct.
8167070	8168451	I am the first one of the year.
8169571	8171712	You're the first one of every goddamn show, but you know what?
8171952	8172612	Here's what I say.
8172652	8176773	If you don't like Ranma getting through first every time, they have Skype on the iPhone.
8177653	8179034	You can call us at Orange Lounge Radio.
8179054	8180714	We have a toll-free number, for heaven's sakes.
8180774	8182755	There's plenty of ways to get through to the show.
8182855	8186616	So if you're the only one that wants to have your voice be heard, then so be it.
8186676	8187476	What's on your mind tonight?
8188137	8190758	There are weeks where I let people jump the line.
8190818	8191898	I don't even bother, but...
8194011	8195353	I'll be on my merry little way
8208390	8208950	That would be nice.
8209310	8211731	You know, I think competition is sometimes a little bit healthy.
8212011	8219012	You know what really frustrates me to no end about this whole Comcast stuff is that there's no real competition in this area.
8219112	8225394	I mean, I guess we're starting to see more and more AT&T U-verse, and some people would tell me, oh, well, there's DSL.
8225834	8230315	And I'm actually getting to the point where I don't care if DSL is like a fourth as fast as cable.
8230715	8233836	I'm going to fucking switch if they can't figure this problem out.
8234336	8234836	You know what I mean?
8235476	8235896	I hear you.
8236417	8239379	DSL isn't as fast, but it's just more dependable and more reliable.
8239539	8242101	I mean, that's part of the reason why I switched to fiber optic.
8242121	8244842	I mean, yeah, I had cable, but you know what?
8245283	8255829	When the cable modem goes out at 12 midnight during off-peak hours for 5-10 minutes at a time, I'm switching to something else that's a lot better and besides.
8256770	8258150	Fios TV.
8258271	8261712	Pictures a lot sharper and a lot cleaner than what Cablevision was offering.
8261752	8263112	I don't even really watch TV.
8263152	8264632	It's all about Netflix and all that now.
8264672	8268614	But you live in New York City, too, where you probably have more options.
8269094	8273355	Being here in Sacramento, it's not that Sacramento doesn't have... It's not like we're a podunk town.
8273395	8276576	I think we're number 20 in the nation or something like that.
8276956	8281998	But I live a little bit on the outskirts of Sacramento, so I don't think I have as many options where I live.
8283238	8288059	I hear where you're coming from because where I am, my options are either Cablevision or Verizon.
8288099	8294360	You go in certain parts of New York City, it's either Time Warner or Verizon and sometimes it's RCN or AT&T.
8294400	8295300	It depends on where you go.
8296200	8298901	Big Wang Eater in our chat room is saying, fucking switch.
8299021	8299761	Switch, bitch.
8300301	8302682	I will switch to eating Big Wang.
8302722	8303762	That's who I will switch to.
8304702	8306022	How long ago did you switch to that?
8307903	8308923	You opened the door.
8308963	8309543	I'm sorry.
8309703	8310343	I plead the fifth.
8312739	8313159	We'll be right back.
8333755	8360146	that's all I want oh yes and even with DSL speeds coming up you have to pay more for it let's get back to gaming talk yeah sorry well hey it directly affects my games it's not just wow it's PlayStation Network and this whole White Knight Chronicles being online enabled I can't keep a connection it's getting bad so anyhow I feel you so what else is on your mind my friend anything else
8361423	8362303	Arcade Infinity.
8362403	8369987	Now, before we get into that, just so you know, Colt 45 is a malt liquor, not a beer.
8370467	8374389	So if you're going to pour a 40, you're pouring a 40 of malt liquor.
8374649	8375629	You don't pour beer.
8375769	8376710	Beer is tasty.
8376750	8378471	Malt liquor, not so much.
8378831	8379051	No.
8380111	8383093	That's why I said an ice cold Colt 45.
8383273	8386054	Everything in a can is the same to me unless it's Guinness.
8386314	8387555	But Guinness is better out of a bottle.
8387675	8387915	Truth.
8389741	8390982	True dat, true dat.
8391142	8392423	Even better on tap.
8392583	8393043	That's true.
8393404	8393864	More truth.
8395305	8398387	Alrighty, Ranma, I'm going to go ahead and let you go.
8398447	8401409	But wait, actually, one more question because I'm going to ask this of all our callers tonight.
8401870	8405092	Your favorite game of last year using any criteria you want.
8405132	8406313	There is no right or wrong answer.
8407494	8409916	Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, the game.
8410236	8410696	Because...
8412352	8416713	It was the, again, it's the only game I played more than any other game of all of last year.
8417073	8420494	It just brought me back to my favorite beat-em-ups.
8420514	8423575	I mean, this is a game where people would just come over.
8423675	8425976	It was like the number two game in my house next to Rock Band.
8426016	8427856	I wish we could get people together and have fun.
8428016	8432998	This is like, I felt like I was like 10, 11, 12 years old playing this game, you know?
8433438	8434238	Nothing's wrong with that.
8434298	8435058	Fun is where it's at.
8435479	8436019	Got that right.
8436199	8437479	Alright, Rama, you have a good one.
8437499	8438279	We'll see you next time.
8438900	8439360	You got it.
8439460	8439780	Later.
8440260	8440460	Later.
8441137	8460924	877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Give us a call, we'll talk SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says Guinness is a meal, really Well, yeah, I mean Well, it's liquid bread I suppose you could look at it that way And there's no other last minute stories in-house We've got nothing but calls to go on
8462024	8463846	I was going to make more recommendations.
8463986	8466008	Sure, give us a couple more while we wait for some calls.
8467189	8469471	Shoot One Up was supposed to be a really good one.
8470371	8472433	And that's pretty cheap.
8473074	8474955	Explosion Aid was another good one.
8474975	8476917	That was by the guys that did Weapon of Choice.
8477457	8479239	And really cool looking shooter game.
8479379	8479919	Here comes a call.
8480460	8481500	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8481521	8481841	Who's this?
8482561	8483542	Legend of Zaku here.
8483602	8484183	Hello, my friend.
8484203	8485944	How are you doing?
8486024	8486765	Doing pretty good.
8487245	8487846	What's on your mind, buddy?
8488962	8491484	Nah, I know Adam mentioned Arcade Infinity.
8491504	8493105	You probably already covered this to death.
8493865	8498488	But the way I see it is that I'm surprised it managed to go this long.
8499909	8507313	Given the fact that, you know, round one pretty much was a death blow to them.
8508314	8510735	And don't get me wrong with round one.
8510796	8514458	At least they're like an authentic Japanese entertainment center to an extent.
8515578	8518000	And they do a lot better than D&B, but
8518499	8519179	I don't know.
8519499	8521440	Arcades are pretty much dead at this point.
8521460	8522541	I hate to say it.
8522881	8523381	They're dead.
8523581	8524521	They're just not dying.
8524902	8525862	They're pretty much dead.
8526462	8531144	It's funny you bring up D&B because I was at Dave & Buster's this week and it's still kicking.
8531424	8532344	There's still quite a few people there.
8532364	8533785	No, but that's corporate owned.
8533845	8538187	I'm talking about mom and pop operations like Arcade Infinity.
8538267	8538747	I gotcha.
8540147	8541528	Those are on their way out.
8541608	8543989	The rest of them are pretty much on death row.
8544690	8550181	Unless, of course, you have foot traffic, but yeah, it's a disaster state of affairs now.
8551724	8555832	It just, you know, it doesn't make sense when, you know,
8557509	8560651	I get... No, I get what you're saying.
8560691	8568056	Sadly, it's one of those things where, yeah, we covered the story here, and it was kind of one of those, oh, that's kind of sad, but it's also not surprising.
8568396	8569877	I mean, that's just... You're right.
8569917	8579283	Arcades have been kind of going this way, and there's not been a lot that's really made us have to go, oh, we've got to go to the arcade and have that experience, because now we have the internet, you know?
8579483	8579583	And...
8581343	8585345	It's so weird because OLR started because of arcade culture.
8585945	8588225	And that couldn't happen today.
8588425	8590646	And it's kind of sad in a way.
8590946	8595187	But even our little arcade culture has moved to the internet in its own little way.
8595728	8598948	And it's not like the internet didn't exist then because we used to have our own little forums.
8599269	8603350	The Sacramentals were our little DDR team and so forth, which wasn't really a team.
8603390	8604990	It was just kids that played DDR.
8605430	8606931	But, you know...
8607751	8608512	XBOX Live and MMOs
8625158	8653629	it's pretty much on it's days are pretty much numbered somebody has to innovate somebody has to innovate somewhere and of course I don't know what that answer is or I'd be a freaking millionaire but surely there is something where people would want to do it in person you know what I mean there's got to be something that will get people I always want to do it in person you know what I mean the folks who run the classic arcades they're probably going to be around for a while because all of that generation of
8654431	8654972	Thanks for watching!
8668422	8671243	and just, you know, pick up the torch where they left off.
8671764	8676486	You know, as long as they're right, as long as they're like running a tight ship.
8676766	8677787	I gotta say this.
8677907	8678907	I gotta say this though too.
8679067	8680348	I mean, let's be real.
8680908	8683629	AI also, it was in kind of a shitty location.
8684230	8685430	Right, round one.
8685790	8697416	It didn't really have a lot of advertising and I realized it was an independent thing but unless you were kind of on the internet, I had no idea about this place until I was like online and posting on DDR boards.
8697876	8698756	It's not even that.
8699216	8701917	I heard they were getting flack from the city.
8702137	8704998	They were really hesitant about renewing their licenses.
8705038	8705418	Wow.
8705838	8706138	Sad.
8706218	8706598	Right.
8706998	8718260	And coupled with the fact that their landlord raised their rent constantly, raised their rent to the point where they had no choice but to be driven out.
8718620	8720741	And then round one showed up.
8721181	8725602	So it was like so many forces and they pretty much were
8726621	8731863	Let me ask you, I've been asking everybody else to wrap up and get more calls.
8731883	8733623	What was your favorite game of all last year?
8733643	8734704	Any criteria you want?
8734744	8735144	Let me see.
8756525	8757405	Any criteria?
8757445	8761467	Would that be... I'm thinking Bad Company, too.
8762068	8763068	Why is that?
8763908	8765789	Just because of its crack-like addictions.
8765989	8774814	Especially the multiplayer, where even though it's team-based, it's just like on the PC, there's no ass-hattery.
8774914	8775694	Everyone helps.
8775754	8776394	Everyone fights.
8776794	8777435	No one quits.
8778829	8805751	I wish there could be less asshattery in online games that is one thing I would say Red Dead Redemption but I just started that game a few days ago that is one thing I will say that arcades always kind of have over the online stuff is that online you can hide behind your monitor but in arcades if you're going to be an asshole you have to be an asshole to people's faces that's one thing I do miss about arcades alright Zaku I gotta let you go because we can get more calls have a good one buddy later
8808046	8809107	Alright, we'll get to some more calls.
8809147	8810168	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8810188	8810548	Who's this?
8811649	8812309	Hey, what's up guys?
8812329	8813030	This is Kaijudo.
8813450	8814691	Kaijudo, what's on your mind, buddy?
8815872	8816152	Not much.
8816172	8817793	Hold on, my phone is crapping out on me.
8818134	8820916	Alright, my game of the year was Mag, for sure.
8821196	8822157	I really enjoyed that game.
8822457	8822897	Mag?
8822917	8823698	My game of the decade.
8824218	8824519	Mag.
8824739	8826560	Game of the decade?
8827421	8828141	No, I know Mag.
8828421	8830743	They've even announced a sequel to Mag already, right?
8832044	8833245	Yeah, yeah, I've heard some news about it.
8833265	8836908	I know that Zipper has a podcast where they discuss the game, but I haven't
8837327	8838008	and DarkSakura.com
8852901	8855102	No, Loki would be right there with you, buddy.
8855303	8858705	Loki, Grand Theft Auto 4, Game of the Decade, possibly?
8859186	8859506	Maybe?
8860927	8861568	It's pretty good.
8862148	8866091	I don't know if I... Yeah, you had people complaining about the water.
8866612	8872316	I think that was some of the best computer-generated water I've ever slammed in a game, and I can't believe people even hated that.
8872737	8873017	I don't know.
8873450	8874650	It's just a weird hate for that game.
8874790	8879931	I think when that's, like, if you're complaining about the water above everything else, like, really?
8880111	8881451	That's kind of a stretch, you know?
8882031	8884472	I can think of games that have many more problems than the water.
8885472	8894094	Yeah, they complained about the water and the driving just because you couldn't just, you couldn't speed down the street at, like, 200 miles a minute, you know?
8894114	8897214	They claimed that that was also a problem with the game.
8897234	8897494	I don't know.
8897534	8897974	I love the game.
8897994	8900815	But anyway, what else I want to get to is arcades.
8900955	8902155	You asked about innovation.
8902809	8908233	and I think that the way they'll probably be able to save it is virtual reality.
8908654	8916900	Like some type of apparatus that I know they already have something like that but they need something where you'll have a group of people that'll stand in it and there'll be some type of multiplayer aspect.
8916940	8921824	I think that multiplayer to the arcade will actually be something that might be able to save it.
8922144	8922825	So the holodeck?
8924065	8927248	Yeah, pretty much yeah, the holodeck.
8927528	8928729	That'll save the arcades I think.
8929205	8931067	or maybe even Motion Control.
8932147	8948619	I find it kind of fascinating in a way that you're calling in to talk about saving arcades and you also kind of in the same sentence say MAG is the best game that you played last year because MAG is very interesting because it's not an MMO but you can't really call it just some multiplayer online game either.
8948739	8951662	It's like a, it's just, it's a brawl.
8952162	8952882	You know what I mean?
8954564	8955805	Yeah, it's really great.
8955845	8956265	I mean, I think
8957257	8963340	As far as first-person shooters go, that's the main reason why I like MAG was just because it's very innovative.
8963380	8974606	They were doing something that you're not seeing in Call of Duty, that you're not even seeing in Halo, and I just can't believe how people just knock any type of new innovation that comes out of it.
8974626	8986592	If the first-person shooter is not Call of Duty, they knock it down, and if the game isn't... What's the other big game that they have out there that people seem to
8987862	8988322	Halo.
8989023	8989743	I'm drawing a blank.
8990584	8991405	Oh, WoW, there you go.
8991465	8993366	Yeah, if it's not WoW, it also gets shot down.
8993406	8994247	Black Ops.
8994307	8997229	It's like you could only... Yeah, it's like you could only make those two games.
8997269	9003333	It's like you can only make Call of Duty for shooters and you can only make WoW for MMOs, you know?
9003453	9005775	It's like the only two games in existence in people's minds.
9007356	9008977	I mean, don't get me wrong, I like WoW.
9009157	9014801	I think WoW's great, but I've also played other MMOs and I think, you know, they should also get a chance, you know?
9014941	9015342	I think they're...
9016502	9017763	Great games.
9017783	9019263	I'm just a gamer, period.
9019583	9025086	Do you think there's a way to bring the magic of MAG and what makes that game exciting for you to an arcade?
9025446	9031649	Or do you think that 64-player brawl experience is something you can really only do online and only ever do online?
9032929	9033149	Oh, no.
9033189	9035890	You can bring something like MAG to an arcade.
9036130	9039432	You couldn't have 128 people versus 128 people.
9039912	9043053	But, you know, you could probably have a little skirmish of maybe 400
9044961	9045361	Yeah, I agree.
9045381	9045822	Yeah, I agree with that.
9072728	9074349	Like I said, my multiplayer is where it's at, man.
9074469	9077090	That's going to save the arcades if they want to save it.
9077310	9081071	I mean, I gave up on arcades after Street Fighter 2 came out on PlayStation.
9081431	9083552	I mean, on Super Nintendo.
9083912	9085793	As the old saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them.
9087034	9087214	Yeah.
9087734	9087974	All right.
9088214	9089434	Well, thank you so much for the call, buddy.
9089575	9090015	It was good.
9090235	9091155	No problem.
9091535	9094516	I was going to ask you your game of the year, but you already said you opened it up with Mag.
9094556	9098438	So have fun fragging in Mag, and I hope Mag 2 is just as good, if not better.
9099485	9100146	Yeah, thanks a lot, man.
9100166	9100746	Alright, take care, buddy.
9100766	9101026	Try it.
9101226	9102627	Everyone who's listening, try Mag.
9102747	9103348	It's free now.
9103848	9104249	Just try it.
9104269	9104989	It's free?
9105590	9106090	I like free.
9106290	9107431	Well, it's something like that.
9107471	9108492	You need PlayStation Plus.
9108512	9112955	There's a lot of crazy shit you have to do, but you can get the game for free if you don't want to buy it.
9113351	9114272	All right, I'll have to look into that.
9114372	9115073	All right, take care, buddy.
9115633	9115853	All right.
9117014	9118916	It's almost like he works for the developer.
9118976	9119397	No, I'm kidding.
9119697	9119977	All right.
9119997	9123600	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9123700	9126723	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9128024	9129706	And yeah, we have a very full chat room tonight.
9129746	9130467	Thank you guys for joining us.
9130767	9132048	It's almost like you missed OLR.
9132909	9135912	I'm very, very... Touched?
9136472	9136972	I'm touched.
9138114	9139615	Are you touched in a special way, Rob?
9140512	9160038	I don't know if I'd go that far SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says People are doing that with Technica 2 now They are battling with people for AZ and CA I like where that's going That's a good start Unfortunately that's just one game Alright, let's see Let's go to another call here This will be our last call of the night Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9161218	9164399	Hi, this is ActDeft Hey ActDeft, haven't heard from you in a long time, what's up?
9166040	9170261	Nothing much Just want to talk about some games Sure, what's up?
9172075	9188177	have you tried or have any of you tried the Mexican wrestling game AAA Heroes del Dream I have not tried it and I'm going to assume the other folks in the studio probably haven't either but why don't you tell us all about it I think if we knew more about it I think Dan would play it
9191104	9193545	Well, it's a pretty interesting game.
9195245	9205629	Basically, it's wrestling, but you have many professional Mexican wrestlers, and it's actually a pretty fun game to play on multiplayer.
9206349	9206629	Mm-hmm.
9208510	9211392	Is it like full on with all the theatrics and masks and everything?
9212073	9212313	Yeah.
9212493	9213474	Oh, that's awesome.
9214975	9219359	Yeah, it actually captures all the Mexican wrestling thing.
9219399	9225324	Well, the action and all the things that happen on Mexican wrestling.
9225384	9225824	The drama.
9226625	9227626	Yeah, the drama.
9228966	9241592	Well, basically, even the audience plays a factor, well, plays in the game, not actually playing, but it plays a factor in the game.
9243373	9246475	Was this the game you were telling us about previously that was actually developed in Mexico?
9247901	9252363	Yes, it was developed by Mexicans and Colombians, I think.
9253623	9259125	Though it was, I think, published by Konami in the United States.
9259945	9260265	Awesome.
9260966	9266488	Speaking of interesting things published by Konami, I know this is completely random, but I have to get that out at some point.
9266568	9269829	I was at Dave & Buster's over the weekend, I think I mentioned.
9270429	9275955	One of the things I played while I was there, it was a Wheel of Fortune ticket spitting machine where you guess the puzzle and everything.
9275995	9276856	It was made by Konami.
9277697	9278218	Couldn't believe it.
9278458	9285545	I didn't realize they had the license to do that type of thing, but they do a lot of arcade stuff, or redemption type of things, like slot machines and so forth.
9285786	9287247	You said this was AAA?
9289169	9292713	Oh yeah, she's looking at a video here in the studio right now of this game.
9295467	9296788	Oh, this looks sick.
9298550	9304975	Triple A, it's called, or Triple A. Okay, I think this is immediately awesome.
9304995	9308938	I'm just watching the intro of it.
9308958	9309478	That looks really cool.
9309498	9310179	It's definitely dramatic.
9310219	9311120	Where's the gameplay?
9311220	9313542	Okay, I see that they have some over-the-top wrestlers.
9314202	9315743	Oh, it's the guy in the skeleton suit.
9315803	9316264	I love that.
9316544	9317165	Little creepy.
9317185	9318626	Yeah, he's called La Parca.
9319126	9320027	Oh, this is sweet.
9322418	9325901	DarkSakura is going to be getting her wrestling on pretty soon.
9326001	9329924	I actually like wrestling games, believe it or not, because I like customizing a wrestler.
9330905	9332327	I think that it's fun.
9332727	9335169	If you like wrestling games, you're going to love this.
9335629	9349001	Well, we used to get all of the WWE ones, because the big thing about it is that because some of the publishing went overseas is that they actually have some of the big moves from some of the Japanese wrestlers.
9350920	9359187	and we would, you could actually unlock, like take all these different parts and recreate official, you know, Japanese wrestlers in it and it was really awesome.
9359928	9362069	And I remember, okay, do you remember WrestleMania 2000?
9363831	9364191	Kinda.
9364231	9364732	For the Nintendo 64?
9364772	9364872	Yes.
9367412	9377894	I made this one wrestler who was a Degeneration X guy and we had him fight everybody just on the watch mode and he beat everybody including getting the women's belt.
9380355	9386176	But that's what I like to do with those games is just make somebody and then just have them go in watch mode on all of the things.
9386216	9387056	I think that would be fun.
9389097	9394698	Alright, Actdeft, I got one more question for you and that would be what was the best game you played all last year using any criteria you want?
9396099	9414180	I didn't play that many games this year, well, last year, but I think one game that I really found interesting, it is BBBBBB, or 6B Ah yes, I heard you mention this in chat, what was so great about it?
9415512	9417714	Well, it's actually a pretty simple game.
9418034	9421336	It's a simple platformer.
9422056	9429742	You don't jump, you don't do any spectacular things like in Mario or any platform like that.
9430402	9431403	You control the gravity.
9431863	9440008	You can go up or down, but you can't jump or can't move according to what you want to do.
9440649	9443631	So you have to calculate what you're going to do.
9443671	9445172	If you're going to fall, you have to
9446952	9457574	Well, be very lucky or somewhat skilled so you don't die because many of the rooms are filled with spikes.
9458175	9461435	That's why it's called... Ah, got it.
9462195	9462735	Interesting.
9463376	9464556	It's also very cheap.
9464616	9466596	I think it's $5, I think.
9467676	9470097	And it's a pretty complete game.
9470197	9473358	I think it's the best game I played last year.
9474338	9475218	SimpleJet Innovative.
9475999	9477100	Alright, great.
9477921	9483347	I like hearing about some new games and things that, you know, maybe some of the rest of us missed, so I think that's a great pick.
9483787	9486590	Alright, buddy, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call.
9487631	9488031	Thank you.
9488171	9488532	Take care.
9490151	9492233	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9492333	9494274	Thank you guys so much for calling.
9494614	9495915	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
9496135	9496996	It's always inevitable.
9497216	9500138	It doesn't ring for like five minutes and then suddenly it's ringing off the hook at the end.
9501318	9502679	Please feel free to email us your thoughts.
9502739	9506682	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Make DarkSakura do some work for next week.
9508543	9511785	Anyhow, all joking aside, we've got to wrap up the show and get out of here for the night.
9512225	9514487	Some of us have to get back to work tomorrow bright and early.
9515874	9520459	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts since I believe we are done with the last minute stories tonight.
9520720	9521881	Hey Gary, thanks for being here.
9521941	9532954	I know sadly you didn't get a whole lot of chance to shout at us with the news and everything with what's going on, but hey, have a great week and hope you get some more games and good luck with the tabletop adventures too.
9533226	9533686	Yeah, thanks.
9533706	9534386	Appreciate it.
9534406	9537488	Yeah, I wish I had more time to play video games.
9537808	9538908	There's a lot going on right now.
9539028	9543830	Hopefully I'll be able to get a hold of some more time and some more games in the future.
9543890	9548132	But yeah, I want to finish Batman Arkham Asylum before Arkham City comes out later this year.
9548792	9551513	And I also wanted to try Transformers War for Cybertron.
9551533	9552673	Still haven't gotten to that one yet either.
9553073	9556535	I'll give you an assignment for the next time you come on the show at some point.
9556595	9562517	You got to find us that tabletop game that you think is the most accessible to somebody who's been playing the types of games we play here.
9562910	9566212	That's going to be a challenge, to say the least.
9566252	9566773	There you go.
9566813	9567453	There's your homework.
9567833	9568814	Okay, accepted.
9569374	9569674	All right.
9570635	9571556	We'll go to DarkSakura.
9571596	9573957	DarkSakura, how you doing?
9574197	9575338	Did you have a good first show of the year?
9575638	9576059	I hope so.
9576339	9579401	Yeah, I feel slightly more better.
9579661	9581082	Her spirits have been elevated.
9581142	9583003	Well, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
9583864	9584724	Grr, arg.
9586185	9589628	My final thought is, I don't want to get up at 6 a.m.
9591028	9591769	Loki, your final thought.
9592284	9593505	I don't want to get up at 5 a.m.
9594626	9595407	I don't have to!
9595427	9596028	Wow!
9596208	9598410	Neither do I, but I do sympathize.
9599191	9600572	I actually kind of wish I had your problem.
9602048	9603189	Alright, well that's it guys.
