0	20400	Tonight, January 23rd, 2011, the 3DS US launch gets some details, Final Fantasy games get
20400	25400	sequels and new names, and after over a decade we finally have a release date for Duke Nukem
25400	26400	Forever.
26400	35280	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange
35280	39000	Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
39000	46040	We are live with our 398th episode on this January 23rd, 2011.
46040	48720	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you every week.
48720	52640	With me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.
52640	53640	Hi.
53640	54640	How are you, Dark Sakura?
54640	55640	I have hobbit shoes.
55640	56640	How are you?
56640	57640	Am I not hearing you at all?
57640	58640	Am I muted?
58640	59640	The fabulousness of live radio.
59640	60640	Try again.
60640	61640	La, la, la.
61640	62640	Much better.
62640	63640	Okay.
63640	64640	I'm wearing my hobbit shoes.
64640	65640	What is the hobbit shoes?
65640	68040	I have Vibram five finger multi-sport shoes.
68040	69800	They're the shoes that look like feet.
69800	70800	They're not really shoes.
70800	71800	I'll take a picture.
71800	74160	They're like Spiderman webbing that go on your feet and they're the strangest things.
74160	75160	They're foot gloves.
75160	77280	They're the strangest things I've ever seen.
77280	80840	But they're comfortable and when they break in they're supposed to be really good for
80840	82560	your feet and give you a natural stride.
82560	83880	Would you play DDR in those?
83880	84880	Yeah.
84880	85880	Yeah.
85880	86880	I've seen people do it before.
86880	87880	Might be interesting.
87880	88880	But I'm gonna take a...
88880	89880	Play some Dance Central.
89880	90880	Shake your booty.
90880	91880	I'm not gonna play Dance Central.
91880	92880	I'm gonna play Dance Masters.
92880	93880	Really?
93880	94880	You wouldn't...
94880	95880	Oh, Dance Central's great.
95880	96880	Hara-para.
96880	99600	Dance Masters gets old after like the first five songs you play.
99600	100600	I don't care.
100600	101600	Don't care.
101600	102600	All right.
102600	103600	Whatever.
103600	104600	Let's see if Tech Master Loki cares.
104600	105600	Hi, Loki.
105600	106600	I don't care about Dance Masters.
106600	107600	And we don't hear you either.
107600	108600	What is going on?
108600	109840	It's called ill preparation.
109840	110840	Apparently.
110840	112680	I don't know what this is all about tonight.
112680	114160	Plus that mic.
114160	115160	Everyone's up with it.
115160	116160	I don't know.
116160	117160	You've been getting quieter and quieter every week.
117160	118560	It's because I'm talking quieter and quieter.
118560	120160	They get really loud!
120160	121360	Exactly.
121360	123160	That's why we have to be careful how we tune it for you.
123160	124160	I do that on purpose.
124160	125160	All right.
125160	126160	Well, how's your week been, Loki?
126160	127160	It's been fine.
127160	128160	Yeah?
128160	129160	Good times.
129160	130960	Anything exciting going on with the baby?
130960	131960	Growing?
131960	132960	Getting older?
132960	133960	He's eating some...
133960	135960	He's starting solid foods, I guess.
135960	137800	I saw the avocado post.
137800	143040	He's eating avocado, rice cereal, and...
143040	144120	What else?
144120	146640	When's it okay to start feeding a baby bacon?
146640	147640	Not for a long time.
147640	149200	Oh, what a bummer.
149200	150200	He's getting...
150200	152200	Well, it's avocado, rice cereal, and...
152200	153200	Cheerios!
153200	156800	I think that's actually it, avocado and rice cereal.
156800	161320	But then he's going to be eating, I think, carrots this week.
161320	162320	All right.
162320	165000	Well, good luck in the baby adventures.
165000	168840	Anyhow, we're going to get into how we always like to start off the show.
168840	170000	How was your gaming week?
170000	172240	But first, of course, I want to introduce the chat room.
172240	176260	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com with us here every week.
176260	178800	The always present fourth guest on the show, as we say.
178800	180360	And lots of people making the connection.
180360	183200	I'd written a tweet about this earlier on my Twitter account.
183200	186240	Episode number 400, the way things are right now, will end up being the same day as the
186240	187400	Super Bowl.
187400	189560	That's just great.
189560	190560	That's just fabulous.
190560	194560	Our 400th episode is going to be the same day as the Super Bowl.
194560	196600	I don't know if we really have anything exciting planned, though.
196600	197600	I mean, it's just...
197600	198600	I don't know.
198600	199600	It's just...
199600	200600	After this long...
200600	201840	I have something exciting planned.
201840	204240	I know you've got a little, a little something.
204240	208160	But both of you need to actually stay instead of depart super quick after the show.
208160	211720	I've offered, I don't know how many times, but anyway.
211720	213800	You're not the one I'm worried about, Loki.
213800	219160	All right, but anyway, besides all that stuff, 400 is coming up.
219160	223080	And I don't know if we're doing anything too exciting, special.
223080	224280	You know, I don't know.
224280	229480	After however long we've been doing the show, nine years or whatever, the self-congratulatory
229480	231580	episodes, there's been enough of them.
231580	232580	So we'll see.
232580	236080	500 is the really big deal, or 10 years, whatever comes first, which I guess would actually
236080	237340	be 10 years.
237340	238600	But anyway, enough of that.
238600	241400	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games you have been playing
241400	242400	this week.
242400	244400	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
244400	249200	Um, I made level 75 on World of Warcraft.
249200	251760	And got two of my friends to play.
251760	252760	Addict.
252760	255160	Now I'm the dealer.
255160	256160	Um...
256160	260120	That's what pyramid scheme I say.
260120	261120	Pyramid head scheme.
261120	262120	Ah.
262120	266000	And, uh, I played some Portal.
266000	269840	And uh, some more Mushihime-sama.
269840	271840	And lots of Solitaire.
271840	274300	Because I was at school.
274300	280320	And I updated and installed my own Linux Mint 10 by myself.
280320	282000	On two computers.
282000	283480	And fixed the networking problems.
283480	287860	Now, I know I've heard you talk favorably of Linux Mint before as something you like
287860	291600	to use as another OS besides just, you know, Windows.
291600	297040	What is the advantage, I guess, of doing Linux on one system and Windows on the other?
297040	303080	Specifically in the case of my netbook, it uses less memory and less space.
303080	310080	And if I need to, I can actually boot it off of a USB that I've installed Linux on.
310080	315960	So say that, you know, this computer that I'm on now, say that something goes haywire
315960	320960	in it, all I have to do is boot it off of Linux and I can run through the file system.
320960	323300	And if I need to delete something, I can.
323300	324420	Good times.
324420	325420	It works on everything.
325420	326420	Well, it makes sense.
326420	329880	Uh, there's some folks in our chat room talking about episode 400, by the way.
329880	333420	SalaciousPop in our chat room says, episode 400 is going to be a drunk show, I thought.
333420	334420	That's right.
334420	335420	We had mentioned something about that, hadn't we?
335420	336420	Yes, we have.
336420	337420	Perhaps.
337420	338420	Maybe that will happen.
338420	339420	Um...
339420	343720	And then, uh, SSJ100Matt says, we need Rice Princess and Extifer for episode 400.
343720	344720	We'll see.
344720	347160	We invite them, they'll make it all about them.
347160	349560	If you listen to Hoard House, you'll know, so.
349560	350560	We'll see.
350560	351560	We'll see.
351560	352560	Nothing is impossible.
352560	353880	So that's it for Dark Soccer's Gaming Week.
353880	354880	We'll move on over to Loki.
354880	355880	How was your gaming week?
355880	356880	Um, it was okay.
356880	363720	I played a couple things, um, I tried, I don't know, just for the hell of it, I tried that
363720	368800	one, um, free game that was made by that 14-year-old or something like that, some bubble something
368800	370160	or other.
370160	375400	And, um, it was okay for a few minutes and then I was like, wow, this looks like a really
375400	377160	cheaply made game.
377160	378600	And I got bored with it.
378600	379600	Why do you think it's doing so well?
379600	381200	This is that iPhone, iTouch game.
381200	385160	I hope because people like fucking human interest stories and because people are simpletons
385160	389920	and they like free shit and as long as it has a good storyteacher, well, I better support
389920	391920	it because the 14-year-old made it.
391920	392920	Great.
392920	395760	You know, 14-year-olds make a lot of shit.
395760	396760	Usually.
396760	397760	Yeah.
397760	402120	Um, but, you know, whatever, you know, these are the same people like Angry Birds, so,
402120	410760	you know, one of my, it's not a stretch for them, I guess, um, then I, I literally dusted
410760	415280	off my PS3, uh, to finally put the 500, those things are dust magnets.
415280	419520	You don't dust them off, they'll turn gray.
419520	420520	Yeah.
420520	427960	So, um, I dusted it off and I finally installed my 500 gig hard drive that I had for it and
427960	435040	then I, um, did the noble thing and I installed a custom firmware on it and now all my systems
435040	437600	are modded as they should be.
437600	438760	You're so proud.
438760	444680	It was seriously the black sheep of the bunch and, you know, now, now it's all perfect.
444680	449640	And I know I've read stories about systems bricking and stuff like that, but seriously,
449640	455120	if you just wait a little bit to make sure everything's okay, let the dust settle, you're
455120	456120	all good.
456120	460040	And it's so easy to do, it's seriously scary.
460040	467280	Um, so I did that and then, um, played a little bit of Planet 2, a little bit of that, um,
467280	473360	just a few levels and then a couple, actually just one online level and, um, it's fun.
473360	478200	I like Little Big Planet 1, I mean, that was a fun game, and Little Big Planet 2, obviously
478200	481360	very similar to that, they have some new features that they added in there.
481360	487000	I don't really care for the grappling hook too much and, and I don't know if it's just
487000	492600	the design of the, you know, Dualshock 3 analog sticks or something like that, but for some
492600	497520	reason I was having issues with it trying to, you know, swing my character back and
497520	503000	forth and having the grappling hook, you know, change length, which would normally be controlled
503000	507360	by the up and down on the analog, even though I'm not pushing up and down on the analog,
507360	514280	it was just very, the dead zones for it were really, um, really large, I guess.
514280	519680	So it was difficult to accurately get it to swing and adjust the, you know, size of the
519680	521460	grappling hook and stuff like that.
521460	526160	So it actually killed my character one time, but it's alright, it's kind of cool.
526160	530520	And then I played someone's user recreated levels, the first person shooter Resident
530520	535580	Evil thing, and that was actually kind of cool, um, definitely different and a good
535580	539840	indicator of what you can do with, um, Little Big Planet 2, and then there was also like
539840	545240	a top down RPG game that someone made, um, which I tried out, that was pretty cool.
545240	550120	So, um, lots of unique stuff and I like how they're kind of hinting at some of the things
550120	554680	that you can do in like the first few levels, like they have the ability where you can link
554680	558880	two different levels together or more than two levels together, so like for example say
558880	562560	you wanted to create, you know, like a Mario Brothers game, you can do that, you can create
562560	564760	all the different levels and then just link them all together.
564760	568080	And I'm sure it's only a matter of time before somebody does create Mario Brothers in Little
568080	569080	Big Planet.
569080	570080	It's probably already happened, actually.
570080	572280	Oh, I'm sure it already has.
572280	578240	But it's really cool, I mean, I really, I've been trying to play it for like the longest
578240	583880	time, but you know, trying to be able to play a game on my big TV, um, it's not really working
583880	584880	out for me.
584880	589120	Thankfully though, and this will also kind of help out with, if I have to ever stream
589120	594400	DJ Hero 3 or something, I have a new capture card for my laptop that I can just plug into
594400	598760	USB, so it allows me to play games and just hook straight up to my laptop and I can play
598760	604560	it off the screen, no lag, so, um, that'll give me an additional screen to play Little
604560	605560	Big Planet on.
605560	609640	Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelandscreeter.com, there's some people that are asking about
609640	615640	your hacking habits, uh, BlackWolf says, now you never have to pay for another game, yay!
615640	619080	Which is a very tongue-in-cheek comment from BlackWolf because he's actually very anti-video
619080	620080	game piracy.
620080	624480	Uh, but, Loki, you do still buy games, you bought, what, like seven copies of Grand Theft
624480	627520	Auto IV on various systems or something?
627520	630840	And, uh, it's not like you don't pay for games.
630840	635200	Uh, so then, I guess this leads to the question from AkumaJP, Loki, what is the benefit of
635200	637840	custom firmware for the PS3?
637840	638840	Lots of things.
638840	642360	One, um, you can play all the different homebrew stuff that they have on there.
642360	645280	You can add different features to your system.
645280	649200	It's just really early, so a lot of the stuff we don't know yet what you're gonna be able
649200	654840	to do with it, but, um, yes, there's definitely the backing up portion of it that you can
654840	660980	back up games and, you know, pirate stuff if you want to, um, will I do that?
660980	665320	Probably not, because I had the ability to jailbreak my PS3 for the longest time, I actually
665320	670560	had the tools to do it, but, I just didn't, there was no reason, like, I literally sat
670560	674600	there going, well, I could do this and pirate a bunch of games, but, there's no real games
674600	675600	I wanna play!
675600	681480	I mean, so, it's like, that's sad, I mean, if I really don't wanna, you know, if there's
681480	685120	nothing I really wanna play on there, then, I don't know, but.
685120	688480	As long as I've known you and as long as I've been doing this show with you, you've always
688480	691200	kind of been the type to me that just likes to do it because you can.
691200	694880	Like, you know, because somebody's like, you're not supposed to hack your PS3 to be able to
694880	700320	run this, and you're very much the type that's like, well, yes I can, you know, I'm gonna
700320	702240	do it anyway, and then it is.
702240	703240	Pretty much, yeah.
703240	708080	So, alright, anyhow, is that it for your gaming week?
708080	714480	Oh, I wanted to ask you something about Little Big Planet 2, excuse me, Little Big Planet
714480	718320	2, what was, kind of, you mentioned there's some new features and so forth, what was one
718320	721800	of the first things that jumped at you that you noticed was different about the game from
721800	723640	Little Big Planet 1?
723640	731080	Um, I mean, the springboards, I guess, that was like the first thing that they show that's
731080	732080	different.
732080	738040	Um, I like, it did import my character and all my stuff that they had collected in the
738040	740480	first game, which is kind of cool.
740480	746240	Um, I don't know, there's not a lot right now that's different, it's just a few different
746240	750960	things, but I mean, I know that the game is gonna be really, because it's kind of, I'm
750960	755080	still going through the first few levels of the game where the tutorial levels, you know,
755080	760640	so they haven't really introduced a ton of stuff yet, it's just very much like the first
760640	766680	game right now, um, but that's alright, because the first game was awesome.
766680	771160	Um, I did, I do like how they had some voice acting in the game, like the cut scenes, the
771160	776840	cut scenes are actually, um, very unique, um, and then also I like how, and I'm not
776840	781820	sure if the Da Vinci character or whatever is voiced by John Cleese, but it sounds like
781820	786160	it, and then later on, because they only have voice acting through the cut scenes, through
786160	790640	the rest of the game, he's just kind of mumbling, it sounds like John Cleese mumbling, which
790640	791640	is kind of funny.
791640	796160	I thought they had gotten his talent to voice something, I don't know if it was that, but
796160	798200	maybe a different, no it was Fable 3 I'm thinking of.
798200	799200	Yeah, he was the butler.
799200	802720	I don't know, he very well could be in the Little Big Planet as well, I didn't follow
802720	803720	it that closely.
803720	808240	Sadly, I did not get to play Little Big Planet 2 this week, because I'm trying to save money
808240	813520	right now, so I can't justify a lot of new $60 games, and so for that reason, I don't
813520	816600	have a lot of new games to report on this week sadly, haven't played anything really
816600	820800	brand brand new, except I will mention this, because it's kind of different, and along
820800	824440	with all the like, I guess, doing things you're not supposed to do with your system stuff
824440	829120	that Loki's been talking about, I got an app that got pulled from the app store about like
829120	833120	12 hours after it was up, so I'm kind of happy I got this app.
833120	839000	It's called iDOS, and it's for the phones, and it's basically a DOS emulator for the
839000	840000	iPhone.
840000	841000	Awesome.
841000	844600	So, what you can do is that there's various like DOS games that were actually kind of
844600	850040	included in the little store that come with it, like Duke Nukem, the original side scroller
850040	856960	is in it, and Wolfenstein 3D, the shareware episode is available there, and so on.
856960	860200	And let's see, I can actually fire up, I'm gonna fire up Wolfenstein 3D here real quick
860200	863200	on the phone, so you can kind of see this.
863200	865940	The only thing that kind of sucks about it, which actually is a really big drawback, is
865940	871240	that, again, the iPhone makes for a shitty controller, a very shitty controller, especially
871240	875680	when there's like eight different buttons on here to be able to play this, which is
875680	877300	next to impossible.
877300	884200	So you can kind of like, I don't know if you can hear like the old school ad-lib sound
884200	889560	effects there in the mic, but yeah, perhaps, but it's kind of cool.
889560	894760	But just playing it is a pain in the ass, like it just, it doesn't play very well, so.
894760	898760	It's just cool for a minute to say, hehe, DOS games I remember from when I was 12, but
898760	902520	until they get more tangible controls for this thing, it's just gonna be a little ridiculous,
902520	903520	I think.
903520	907400	Plus, I kind of like the fact that I got this app when I wasn't supposed to have it, woohoo!
907400	911080	So that's really the only, like, woohoo!
911080	916520	The only one I wanted to get, actually, that got pulled immediately was Minecrafted, which
916520	919960	was the Minecraft client for- Really?
919960	921160	I didn't even know they had that, okay.
921160	922440	Yeah, it was very brief.
922440	926920	It's supposed to be coming back later, but it was like a leaked version of it.
926920	930880	Funny, though, you mentioned Duke Nukem and stuff like that.
930880	935320	Well, Duke Nukem was on the store, I think, already, and then Wolfenstein is actually
935320	941440	available through, well, through Cydia, if you have a jailbroken device.
941440	942440	Which I don't.
942440	944880	I don't know, I'm like- And yes, it still controls like crap.
944880	948000	I know hella people jailbreak their iPhone and they even came out on the courts and said
948000	952360	that you can or whatever, but I just, I don't know, I'm all paranoid about that stuff, because
952360	956840	this thing is like my life, my texting, my phone, I can't have it go wrong.
956840	961360	Well, but you're already on 4- It's not worth it to relive Wolfenstein 3D
961360	962360	all over again, you know what I mean?
962360	963360	No, it's not.
963360	965440	So that's kind of my perspective on it, so.
965440	969080	Alright, so that was really it for my gaming week, otherwise just more of the same stuff,
969080	973880	you know, WoW, Pac-Man, the new Championship Edition deluxe, and so forth.
973880	976320	So, that's it for my week.
976320	979080	Some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's news.
979080	983840	You can, of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and we're also available
983840	989040	on Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and of course we do tape live at All
989040	994080	Games Radio, allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right
994080	999040	after the Bobby Black Wolf show, if you ever do want to come in and join a live episode.
999040	1001840	Please do join us sometime, we'd like to reach you.
1001840	1007200	Maybe you can sync your PS, or your iPhone with a PS3, they were saying use it as a router
1007200	1008200	for a controller.
1008200	1013000	Well, you don't even have to really necessarily do that, some actual homebrew programs through
1013000	1021000	like Cydia and stuff like that, it allows you to sync a Wii remote to your iPod or iPad
1021000	1024000	to play Nintendo or Super Nintendo games.
1024000	1025640	It's just not worth it.
1025640	1027360	It's pretty awesome, though.
1027360	1029920	Too much, too much work for not enough payoff.
1029920	1033800	Alright, let's move on to tonight's news, we will start off with, of course, the one
1033800	1035680	and only Loki tonight.
1035680	1036760	Yes.
1036760	1043320	So it's kind of sad, they were trying to find a buyer for bizarre entertainment, or bizarre
1043320	1050880	creations or whatever, and unfortunately Activision was unable to do so, that's, dude, they put
1050880	1058760	out some pretty awesome racing games and hell, they had a pretty awesome arcade shooter game.
1058760	1065040	I can't believe no one wanted to buy the developer of the original Project Gotham games and Geometry
1065040	1066320	Wars, which was huge.
1066320	1067320	Microsoft?
1067320	1068320	Hello?
1068320	1069320	I'm shocked.
1069320	1070320	Shocked.
1070320	1075640	But anyways, but I mean, this is kind of a trend if you think about it, I mean, look
1075640	1081760	at Harmonix, they're all, oh, nope, no buyers for Harmonix either, I mean, other than themselves.
1081760	1087680	I don't know, maybe just people aren't snapping up developers anymore, but I mean, I guess
1087680	1095320	Blur didn't do as well as they had hoped, and, god, I can't remember their stupid running
1095320	1096880	gun shooter that they had.
1096880	1098960	Wasn't there a James Bond game that had come out recently?
1098960	1106160	Oh yeah, yeah, the last James Bond game, but, I mean, come on though, what do you expect,
1106160	1110740	and this is Activision's fault, I'm sorry, this is plainly their fault, what do you expect
1110740	1116080	when you release a okay first person shooter the week before Black Ops?
1116080	1118360	I mean, seriously, you expect it to do well?
1118360	1122120	No, they expected it to die!
1122120	1126600	So I don't know, it could have done a lot better if it was released in a different part
1126600	1132320	of the year or next year or whatever, and it really was, oh, well, we have the license
1132320	1136760	to the Bond series, ah crap, they're not making another movie, well, we need to make some
1136760	1140580	money off of this license we paid for, so let's make a game.
1140580	1144280	And ironically now they are making another Bond movie, didn't they announce that a couple
1144280	1145280	weeks ago?
1145280	1147280	And they're just making another game?
1147280	1148280	Huh.
1148280	1149280	Interesting.
1149280	1150280	That's not bizarre.
1150280	1154360	That's such a bummer, I mean, I had heard somewhere, I don't remember, it was earlier
1154360	1158080	in the week, so forgive me if my memory is a little rusty, but there's some type of new
1158080	1162600	tax in, I don't know if it's Britain, the greater part of Britain, or if it's just this
1162600	1166520	area that the Bizarre Creations studio is in that has something to do with video games
1166520	1169960	that actually may have had an impact that maybe was too expensive to keep these guys
1169960	1172440	up and running where they're at now.
1172440	1176560	It's one of those, you know, it's cheaper to get folks in another country to do the
1176560	1177680	development or whatever.
1177680	1183200	Yeah, well they're basically recommending that they close them now, is the recommendation
1183200	1184200	I guess.
1184200	1188960	And I guess they recently did the same thing with Budcat in the US.
1188960	1192460	Well I'm hoping that, you know, it's one of those for every door that closes and other
1192460	1197000	opens type of scenarios where at least these guys might get, you know, on their feet somewhere
1197000	1201040	else, or maybe they'll do that thing where they start up their own darn studio, which
1201040	1203040	we've seen a lot of developers in the past do.
1203040	1204040	You never know.
1204040	1206040	Try some different ideas.
1206040	1209320	I can't believe that means there's never going to be another Geometry Wars game.
1209320	1210320	Eh, whatever.
1210320	1212320	Unless, well, I don't know, I really like that series.
1212320	1214120	I ain't really going to improve upon that, I mean.
1214120	1219080	Eh, I guess you could look at it that way, but, and I guess technically, what, Activision
1219080	1223440	would own that, so they could always have one of their other developing houses do it,
1223440	1226040	but I don't know, it just, it wouldn't be the same.
1226040	1227040	Yeah.
1227040	1230440	So, well, that's too bad.
1230440	1233120	Chat dot orange lounge radio dot com for some comments.
1233120	1237000	Uh, Ezominar chat room says, this is probably a time where they would rather purchase intellectual
1237000	1241600	properties to re-release rather than take on new employees.
1241600	1245400	AlphaKananagram says, WTF, Geometry Wars 2 is the shit.
1245400	1248600	I agree, Geometry Wars 2 is awesome, and it's kind of a bummer.
1248600	1253240	But maybe since the Xbox Live Arcade especially, and, and I guess to some extent the PlayStation
1253240	1258080	Network, is pretty easy to develop for, I mean, I'm, I don't know, I'm not a video game
1258080	1262520	developer, but I am assuming that what, the, the folks that put out Super Meat Boy, not
1262520	1264600	exactly a large development studio, correct?
1264600	1268320	Wasn't it like three or four different people kind of buds getting together doing this game?
1268320	1269320	Pretty much.
1269320	1272660	And granted, it's not on PlayStation Network, but it could have been, because I think they
1272660	1275200	have some dealio with Microsoft.
1275200	1281120	So my hope, maybe these guys that end up losing their stuff at Bazaar can kind of go and develop
1281120	1288680	maybe for these smaller platforms, like handhelds and Xbox Live Arcade, the Geometry Wars-esque
1288680	1292800	sort of games, or whatever other ideas they might have, because, you know, Blur was a
1292800	1294320	pretty good idea too.
1294320	1300400	That was a, I, I really think if there had been a Blur 2, it would have been awesome.
1300400	1304720	Blur 1, it was a good game, but it did need some work.
1304720	1309120	But I love that idea of the arcade racer meets Mario Kart, and the commercials for that were
1309120	1314100	always so awesome, where it was, um, the little Mario Kart cute characters that are practically
1314100	1317720	getting run over by the adult- Better yet, make it an arcade game.
1317720	1318720	Perhaps.
1318720	1319720	Perhaps.
1319720	1322200	Uh, Derek H. in our chat room seems to agree with me.
1322200	1324920	I hope the people from Bazaar reform a new studio.
1324920	1327040	I hope so too, or at least a good portion of them.
1327040	1330360	I hear respawn's hiring.
1330360	1331360	Never know what might happen.
1331360	1334880	Alright, moving on to some other news, and this has something to do with kind of like
1334880	1339920	basement development, if you will, on a very large scale.
1339920	1345360	StarCraft 2, of course, you know, has some very flexible development materials, we'll
1345360	1346560	say, in the game.
1346560	1350140	And people have been able to make all sorts of games within StarCraft 2, hell, there's
1350140	1355920	an endorsed by Blizzard shooter that's actually in the game, like a shoot-em-up type game
1355920	1356920	that's there.
1356920	1363660	Well, somebody has actually gone to such great lengths, they have created World of StarCraft,
1363660	1367320	and in looking at some of the screenshots in these movies that were subsequently pulled
1367320	1371240	from YouTube, I'll get to that in a minute, they really had kind of a look and feel, if
1371240	1376320	you will, of World of Warcraft, but with the StarCraft universe, where you could pick different
1376320	1380920	classes such as, say, Marine, or what have you, and the different factions in the game,
1380920	1383560	of course, being the three factions that are with StarCraft.
1383560	1388200	Well, there were some teasers that were up on the internet, and they got pulled pretty
1388200	1389200	quickly.
1389200	1392680	Blizzard put the smackdown on those and took them down.
1392680	1397600	And a lot of people were saying, boo, Blizzard, you guys are a bunch of bastards for taking
1397600	1400440	this stuff down, why would you do that?
1400440	1407440	And the modder who created this, Ryan Wenzel, you know, even kind of went on his own forums
1407440	1411320	saying, I don't really know what's going on right now, you guys, this is all kind of developing
1411320	1412320	at a fast pace.
1412320	1413320	Well, here's the deal.
1413320	1418560	Activision Blizzard is actually not trying to shut down this mod altogether, but I think
1418560	1422800	the problem that they're having is that it's the World of StarCraft name that they don't
1422800	1423800	like.
1423800	1427880	They don't want this guy making his mod called World of StarCraft.
1427880	1432560	So it looks like this MMO is actually going to continue on, but under a new name.
1432560	1438880	By the way, Ryan Wenzel, the modder, has actually been invited by Blizzard to go meet the StarCraft
1438880	1440560	2 development team.
1440560	1441560	Interesting.
1441560	1443860	Also, this whole thing expanded so fast.
1443860	1447800	He was also invited by the folks that made the MMO League of Legends.
1447800	1450440	I don't know if you've seen that, but that's like Defense of the Ancients kind of, actually
1450440	1454480	that is a game I did get to see like 15 seconds of a little bit this weekend.
1454480	1455800	One of my friends is into that.
1455800	1458840	And it's like a Defense of the Ancients kind of like game, the old mod.
1458840	1462000	The people that make that invited this guy to go interview with him.
1462000	1465600	So his net celebrity went up like exponentially real quick.
1465600	1466600	That's cool.
1466600	1467600	Yeah, it's kind of cool.
1467600	1470400	It was cool that he was invited by Blizzard though, because Blizzard was like, dude, dude,
1470400	1473440	dude, it's not the mod we're not cool with.
1473440	1474440	It's the name.
1474440	1476520	So hopefully they're going to be able to work this out.
1476520	1477980	And Blizzard wanted to make it clear.
1477980	1483360	It was never our intention to stop development on the mod, but with the name so closely resembling
1483360	1487920	that of World of Warcraft, we wanted to discuss the title of the mod with the developer.
1487920	1492880	And as part of our routine procedure, we contacted YouTube to request the video be removed while
1492880	1495320	that discussion took place.
1495320	1499000	Such a little like politically correct way of saying that.
1499000	1501600	So, interesting, huh?
1501600	1502600	Yeah.
1502600	1506480	It's like, we're not trying to be jerks, but no.
1506480	1507480	It's all branding.
1507480	1512520	It's also, I think what's going on here, the unsaid part too, is it's a lot of that big
1512520	1517600	company syndrome where I'm sure the developers actually kind of had their eyebrows raised
1517600	1519800	going, that's kind of cool what this kid did.
1519800	1524440	Whereas the legal team and the protections of all this were like, hell no, shut it down.
1524440	1526120	You don't protect it, you lose it.
1526120	1527120	Exactly.
1527120	1531000	So I think, whereas the development team was like, yeah, come on over and play with us
1531000	1532000	for a day.
1532000	1533000	Let's see what you're up to.
1533000	1537840	The legal team was like, hell no, you need to shut it down under this name.
1537840	1541880	So it's kind of interesting how that all works together.
1541880	1544640	That sounds very corporate to me.
1544640	1547520	Well, you know what else is stupid?
1547520	1548520	What is stupid?
1548520	1549520	Nintendo.
1549520	1550520	What?
1550520	1551520	You don't say.
1551520	1557560	Well, basically, they were talking to Kotaku and said that they didn't see any reason to
1557560	1563480	put in some sort of trophy or achievement system because they don't want to tell people
1563480	1568840	how to play the games to get some kind of, quote, mythical reward.
1568840	1575520	The US exec Bill Trinen is quoted saying, basically, the way the games are designed
1575520	1580280	is they're designed for you to explore the game yourself and have a sense of discovery.
1580280	1584560	So it's like, we don't want to give you directions on what to do in the game.
1584560	1587640	We want you to find everything on your own.
1587640	1588640	Which I understand that.
1588640	1592060	And they say that they're not really against the idea of trophies.
1592060	1595720	They just don't want it to be the whole purpose for playing the game.
1595720	1599680	They believe that except for Super Smash Bros. Brawl, in which case they don't care about
1599680	1600680	that.
1600680	1601680	Well, that's what I said.
1601680	1604640	They are not against them.
1604640	1607080	It's just that they don't want that to be the full basis of the game.
1607080	1611960	I just don't think they want to license the rights to, you know how a lot of these people
1611960	1617520	copyright different things or have patents for trophy systems and stuff like that?
1617520	1619520	They probably just don't want to license that crap.
1619520	1621760	I have no idea and neither do I care.
1621760	1627680	It's just, they, I kind of think it's interesting that they went on the limb to say this.
1627680	1629560	Since everybody else is doing it.
1629560	1636160	Once Xbox started having it, Playstation had it, and they have them in MMOs and all kinds
1636160	1637160	of stuff.
1637160	1638160	Way to go Nintendo.
1638160	1642480	Way to not embrace something that's popular right now.
1642480	1646200	Online gameplay, meh, whatever, we don't need that.
1646200	1648160	Trophies, eh, we don't need that.
1648160	1650800	Organized community, eh, whatever.
1650800	1652360	I don't know.
1652360	1657200	Like I get this story and all, but it strikes me a little bit as a reason that's invented
1657200	1658920	after the fact.
1658920	1663040	Like that the Wii simply was not programmed to have this type of functionality in it.
1663040	1667640	And I sort of get that because the Wii doesn't have anything like Xbox Live, like Playstation
1667640	1668640	Network.
1668640	1672880	There's no centralized Wii service except for, granted, Wii Connect 24, the thing that
1672880	1676480	lets you send the mails and all that stuff and the friend code play online.
1676480	1677480	But I don't know.
1677480	1681680	It just, I don't know enough about how computers talk to each other and how the internet actually
1681680	1685360	works, but it doesn't strike me as quite the centralized system that the other two are.
1685360	1688600	It could be patched in later if they really wanted to.
1688600	1689960	They did it with the PSP.
1689960	1692400	Or they're launching a new console.
1692400	1695000	You know, they could kind of roll it out with that if they wanted to.
1695000	1696000	I don't know.
1696000	1700120	I just feel like there might be a little more value in Virtual Console, especially if they're
1700120	1705500	gonna try to get us to buy the same games again on the 3DS, to have some type of trophy
1705500	1709840	room for actually having played these games and getting scores on them.
1709840	1714840	I mean, even if it's just a frickin' high score table, fuck, I'd take Game Center over
1714840	1715840	nothing.
1715840	1716840	You know what I mean?
1716840	1719900	And Game Center, not that great.
1719900	1720900	But it's better than nothing.
1720900	1723640	I also personally don't care about achievements myself.
1723640	1728000	I just play the games to enjoy them and have fun.
1728000	1733280	I do, I get that, but it's sort of like, it's kind of nice to have that little pat on the
1733280	1734280	back.
1734280	1735280	To have that in your portfolio.
1735280	1739080	The only reason I've tried to get any achievements in World of Warcraft is for the experience.
1739080	1742040	Because, you know, I've got experience points for it.
1742040	1743040	Yeah.
1743040	1744040	That's it.
1744040	1746320	You get experience points for doing quests and stuff, but you don't get-
1746320	1748400	I got them for getting the exploration ones.
1748400	1750680	Oh yeah, because you get experience points.
1750680	1751680	Yeah, I get it.
1751680	1752680	Yeah.
1752680	1753680	But other than that, I don't care.
1753680	1757720	It really just, I, you know, I laughed at that one because I thought it was funny, but
1757720	1761640	other than that, it was like, okay, someone did something that they were gonna be doing
1761640	1762640	anyway.
1762640	1766000	But yeah, since you bring that up, Blizzard also doesn't really have a centralized server
1766000	1767000	for achievements.
1767000	1770480	Like, you can't, you know, this came up on a previous episode of Hoard House, you can't
1770480	1775200	link your Starcraft and your Warcraft achievements together right now.
1775200	1779200	Maybe when Diablo comes out, there'll be like some type of Blizzard centralized thing.
1779200	1782320	But then again, that'll only ever be for Blizzard games.
1782320	1786120	It's never gonna connect to the Steam and all the Steam achievements.
1786120	1788920	I do, I get that it's starting to get a little fragmented.
1788920	1793120	It is a little silly that, you know, you have your set on the Wii and your set on the 360
1793120	1797240	and the Playstation 3, and it really should just be about beating the game start to finish.
1797240	1801040	But I don't know, I sorta like having that little, that little sticker in my book that
1801040	1803800	says, you did something really weird in this game, you know?
1803800	1806320	Rob, I know how we can fix that problem.
1806320	1807320	How?
1807320	1813320	We just take a page out of Activision's book, we send out patches.
1813320	1816000	Fuck yes!
1816000	1820120	Just like they did back in the Atari 2600 day, that would be amazing, like, that you
1820120	1824880	should get the actual patches for, and if you, you know, didn't read about this way
1824880	1829580	back in the day, back in the 80s when the Atari 2600 was big, you could take a picture
1829580	1833360	of your screen if you get a high score on a game, send it into Activision, and if it
1833360	1836760	was above a certain threshold that would be in the instruction manual, they would send
1836760	1841760	you a patch that you could like put on your leather jacket and, you know, hey, I'm cool.
1841760	1845360	And I'm pretty sure that's where the whole idea of achievements on a 360 came from in
1845360	1846720	the first place.
1846720	1851040	It's really a bummer, actually, that when they did Game Room, uh, you didn't have any
1851040	1853480	type of resurgence of this, you know what I mean?
1853480	1856840	I mean, I guess there were the little trophies in Game Room, but it wasn't quite the same,
1856840	1857840	you know?
1857840	1862880	Because patches are expensive, and if a publisher doesn't have to make unnecessary expenses
1862880	1864520	like that, they won't.
1864520	1866920	But if you print them in mass, it's not that bad.
1866920	1867920	It would be awesome, though.
1867920	1874420	I mean, come on, I've seen some of the tchotchke crap that they just push out for certain game
1874420	1879240	titles that are terrible, but, um, I don't know.
1879240	1880240	They could do it.
1880240	1881840	They're just being lazy.
1881840	1886240	Spagenator in our chatroom says, I wonder if they'll ever be a Diablo MMO.
1886240	1887960	It's kind of World of Warcraft, actually.
1887960	1892960	When I first played World of Warcraft, I was feeling a lot more Diablo than I was Warcraft,
1892960	1899360	because Warcraft is an RTS, and World of Warcraft really isn't, so it's interesting.
1899360	1903920	Derek H. says he had a patch for Barnstorming, and DefectiveCandy says my grandfather had
1903920	1904920	one of those patches.
1904920	1906680	So, some people remember those patches.
1906680	1908500	Well, see, that's the thing.
1908500	1909680	That's how awesome it was.
1909680	1911560	People are still talking about them today.
1911560	1914840	See, if they did that now, that would be awesome.
1914840	1918000	People would be talking about them for a long time.
1918000	1919000	But no.
1919000	1920000	Missed opportunity.
1920000	1921720	It's all about cash now.
1921720	1922720	Unfortunate.
1922720	1926240	Alright, well, what else is in the news, Loki?
1926240	1927240	Big stuff.
1927240	1928240	The 3DS.
1928240	1932560	They finally had the announcement of the release date for the 3DS and the price.
1932560	1935080	We knew it was going to be in March.
1935080	1939080	Now it's been pinpointed to March 27th.
1939080	1945540	The price is going to be $2.50 in the US, or I guess North America, and they're saying
1945540	1951400	that they're going to have quite a few launch games available for that and whatnot.
1951400	1955480	Not really certain on which games are going to make the launch, although two that have
1955480	1960600	been nailed down in the launch period by Nintendo, coming from Nintendo.
1960600	1968360	Unfortunately, are Pilotwings and Nintendogs plus cats.
1968360	1972120	I liked Pilotwings back on the Super Nintendo.
1972120	1978080	The Pilotwings game looked neat, Nintendogs and cats...
1978080	1979960	I know the game's going to suck.
1979960	1985600	I know, it's one of those things where it's like, it would be awesome to try, but I don't
1985600	1986600	want it.
1986600	1989960	Because I know I will get bored with it so quick.
1989960	1991040	It's just...
1991040	1993640	I know exactly what you mean, it's just like the original Nintendogs.
1993640	1996520	You read about it on paper and all the features they're putting in, you're like, oh man, this
1996520	1998400	sounds like it's going to be really cool.
1998400	2000480	And then I just know it, just like the first Nintendogs.
2000480	2003760	I buy the game and it's going to be dumb after 30 minutes.
2003760	2004760	You know what I mean?
2004760	2010240	You're like, God, I have to feed it every day, I have to play with it every day.
2010240	2015040	Nintendogs is kind of, at least the original one, is kind of an overblown Facebook game.
2015040	2017560	The original Nintendogs has a lot in common with a Facebook game.
2017560	2021600	I don't know, I can't explain it, but it's what it feels like to me.
2021600	2022600	Yeah.
2022600	2026960	Some of the interesting things that they were talking about, which is kind of weird, is
2026960	2036080	the system actually has a pedometer built into it, and you get coins by walking around.
2036080	2042320	So you earn coins that you can spend in games for different things.
2042320	2048840	And then they have an activity log, which attracts your gameplay as well as your steps.
2048840	2052880	They're also talking about how you can make Mii's in the interface, and they have that
2052880	2056120	cool feature where you can take a picture of yourself and give you a bunch of different
2056120	2057560	options for Mii's and stuff.
2057560	2059780	You can import your Mii's from the Wii.
2059780	2060920	But you can't go the other way.
2060920	2068920	Yeah, just because it's, well, because they say it's more complex for, you know, than
2068920	2069920	the Wii system.
2069920	2072560	The one on the 3DS is Mii 2.0.
2072560	2078120	Yeah, and it makes sense because if you think about it though, it all comes down to the
2078120	2083280	fact that they can't patch games, because they have all the Mii's and stuff in the backgrounds
2083280	2090160	on the games, but they can't display the ones that they don't have the features for, even
2090160	2099340	if they did an update for the editor or whatever on the Wii to make it more interactive and
2099340	2104800	stuff and add more features, but it would still not be compatible with those games,
2104800	2105800	I think.
2105800	2109800	What do you guys think about that price point, $250 for a 3DS?
2109800	2110800	Do you think that's fair?
2110800	2112320	Do you think it's too much?
2112320	2115840	Because there's some people on the internet that say, you know what, that's too much.
2115840	2116960	I think it's fine.
2116960	2120920	I think it makes sense, because they're not going to really have any competition right
2120920	2121920	now.
2121920	2125540	And I guarantee that thing will be selling for a lot more than that.
2125540	2127640	You're not going to be able to find these things.
2127640	2133760	So you get your orders in while you can, and if you're savvy enough, buy two and sell one
2133760	2137380	on eBay.
2137380	2138380	I kind of agree.
2138380	2141600	I think the price point is actually better than what I was expecting.
2141600	2146160	I thought it was going to be 3DS, $300 was what I was originally thinking they were going
2146160	2149280	to do with it, but no, this is actually lower than I thought.
2149280	2153640	It's right at what I expected, based on what they put out the end retail price.
2153640	2154640	That makes sense.
2154640	2159480	And it kind of leaves them a little room to lower it later.
2159480	2163520	Like if they want to do a cut for Christmas, they probably will.
2163520	2166880	You know, they could cut it to $200 by Christmas with some type of package.
2166880	2167880	I don't think they will.
2167880	2168920	I don't think they need to.
2168920	2173640	I think it's going to be like the Wii, where it was in short supply for a very long time,
2173640	2176520	and they're not going to cut that thing for at least a year.
2176520	2178120	At least a year.
2178120	2180120	It prints money.
2180120	2183520	The price scale will come, and probably a new system revision will come out.
2183520	2188280	I guarantee you that that thing will not be dropping in price by the end of this year.
2188280	2189980	Every kid will want one too.
2189980	2191360	Every freaking kid.
2191360	2193240	It's 3D without glasses.
2193240	2194960	I mean, come on.
2194960	2198280	People are like, oh, it's so stupid, you know.
2198280	2202400	People are just going to be blown away by just seeing the actual screens.
2202400	2208180	They're just going to be blown away.
2208180	2212400	I don't even want to quote certain analysts, but there's people out there that have said
2212400	2216560	they could have charged more than that, and they could have still sold all the units that
2216560	2217560	they had.
2217560	2221040	So, I don't know.
2221040	2223520	I'm looking at some of the comments in our chat room.
2223520	2227400	Game Guru says, $250 is a bit too expensive for a handheld game system.
2227400	2231160	Tiger Claw says, when you put the 3DS with the PSP Go, from the price standing point,
2231160	2233060	the 3DS has the most features.
2233060	2234060	How much was the PSP Go?
2234060	2235520	Was the PSP Go $250 as well?
2235520	2241300	Yeah, but see, okay, there's a difference with the PSP Go and the 3DS, okay?
2241300	2250080	If the 3DS didn't have it, it'd be like the 3D, the DSi, and not even so the DSi, I guess.
2250080	2255000	The PSP Go had less features than the PSP, and they came out at a price point that was
2255000	2260880	more expensive than the current model, and you couldn't buy games for it in stores.
2260880	2264960	So it had people scratching their heads like, why do you want me to get this?
2264960	2271760	There's no enhancements to it other than onboard storage, which memory is so cheap nowadays
2271760	2274000	it doesn't matter.
2274000	2278800	There's no UMD drive, so I can't play any of the games I normally have right now.
2278800	2281200	There's no way for me to convert them into a digital format.
2281200	2288400	I have to rebuy my games if I want to buy the system.
2288400	2292900	There's some Bluetooth support, great.
2292900	2300520	But the thing is, and this is the best part, their retail partners or whatever, like GameStops
2300520	2304640	and stuff like that, or just mom and pop shops, they weren't bringing them in.
2304640	2310480	Well, GameStop might have, because they have better partnerships with these guys, but individual
2310480	2313360	mom and pop shops were not bringing them in, because what money are they going to make
2313360	2314360	off of it?
2314360	2317640	The system, they're making no money off of it, and they can't sell any software for it,
2317640	2321520	so they said, fuck them, we're not bringing this shit in.
2321520	2325000	And people are just like, if you want a PSP, get a PSP 3000.
2325000	2326320	I still say that today.
2326320	2328320	Get a PSP 3000 if you're looking at a PSP.
2328320	2329880	Don't you think you can get a Go anymore?
2329880	2332880	They slowly phase out.
2332880	2335800	So has the PSP went?
2335800	2338840	Let me get to a couple more 3DS stories here, and we'll kind of continue this discussion,
2338840	2342900	because there are some other interesting developments in the 3DS world.
2342900	2344400	Some of it has to do with online play.
2344400	2348440	First off, did you hear that the friend codes are getting reduced to one friend code?
2348440	2352640	So sadly friend codes aren't going away, but it's one friend code for everything.
2352640	2354640	So you won't have a separate friend code.
2354640	2358080	Well I still don't like the idea of a friend code, but I understand that they want that
2358080	2362320	in there so that the rapists can't rape our children through the internet or something
2362320	2363320	like that.
2363320	2365640	Hide your kids, hide your wife.
2365640	2372880	I don't, I still don't get why you can't just have a name instead of a 16 digit randomized
2372880	2373880	code.
2373880	2377520	I mean it's a step in the right direction, but when Nintendo is already three steps behind
2377520	2384280	you when it comes to online play, that news kind of just makes me go, whatever, it's a
2384280	2387840	good thing you figured the 3D thing out, because I don't know otherwise.
2387840	2389520	But that is, I guess whatever.
2389520	2393560	At least you only have the one friend code, despite the fact that it'll not really be
2393560	2394560	something customizable.
2394560	2396880	It is supposed to show you what your friends are playing though.
2396880	2397880	That sounds like a little better.
2397880	2402200	Yeah, and there's apparently an app in it that will show you what the status is of your
2402200	2404120	friends at any time.
2404120	2405780	So you can see what they're playing or what have you.
2405780	2411200	So a little more like you're familiar with Xbox Live, even though it's in an app, interesting.
2411200	2414080	Here's the other thing though that is kind of cool, and to be fair, I should say this
2414080	2415520	when it comes to friend codes.
2415520	2420380	If you are connected to another friend local, on the local wireless, you can push a button
2420380	2424040	to accept or send a friend request and you won't ever have to exchange the number.
2424040	2430120	The 3DS will just automatically grab the information and there you have it, your friends.
2430120	2432520	So that's, okay, now that's a little better.
2432520	2434720	I like that part of it.
2434720	2441840	So if you will, and you're at a convention, you can push a button and then get gang raped
2441840	2442840	by friend requests.
2442840	2451300	Yeah, but it has to be a mutual button pressing, meaning you both have to accept the request.
2451300	2452300	You know what I mean?
2452300	2455640	It's a big old friend request gang bang.
2455640	2459560	I know, the next Penny Arcade Expo or E3, man.
2459560	2463080	You know, the 3DS will be out by this year's E3, so it's going to be kind of interesting
2463080	2464080	to see how.
2464080	2469000	E3 is not so much a fan event as it is a trade slash journalism event, but still, there's
2469000	2472460	going to be, you know how many fanboys still manage to go to E3 because there are blogs
2472460	2473460	and so forth.
2473460	2479360	You know, there'll be plenty of that exchanging and stuff going on.
2479360	2482160	I wonder if they're going to have like a booth like they did back when the DS was new where
2482160	2483960	you could kind of do the download of the demos.
2483960	2486160	So I think that's a good idea.
2486160	2487160	That used to be cool.
2487160	2489760	That's how I played Meteos for the first time, which is still one of my favorite DS games
2489760	2490760	to this day.
2490760	2492760	Well, you know what my game was at that time?
2492760	2493760	Electroplankton.
2493760	2494760	Oh, yes.
2494760	2495760	I remember that.
2495760	2496760	Yeah.
2496760	2497760	I still remember one of the first E3s I went to.
2497760	2498760	No, it was probably the second one.
2498760	2502640	I remember when Shane took the Meteos demo with us, you know, because he just left his
2502640	2503640	standby.
2503640	2504640	Oh, that's all right.
2504640	2505640	Yeah.
2505640	2506640	We all did that one night.
2506640	2510840	We downloaded the Meteos from the 3D, not 3DS, from the DS station that they had on
2510840	2513960	the floor, and then we just didn't close, or we didn't turn off the DS.
2513960	2517040	We would just close the lid, and the battery had been fully charged that morning, so we
2517040	2520200	closed the lid, took it with us, and then at dinner that night, it was like, let's play
2520200	2521200	more Meteos.
2521200	2524480	You know, we still had the demo from the show that morning, so.
2524480	2526620	And I think, yeah, I don't know if it was Shane or somebody.
2526620	2531640	Some people didn't, like, they left their DS on and plugged in, like, after E3 was over
2531640	2534880	so they wouldn't lose the demo, and so they had, some people, I think, had it for, like,
2534880	2538160	up to a week after the show was over, just to still play it more.
2538160	2540360	It was a great puzzle game.
2540360	2545640	Anyhow, another quick story about the 3DS, and this has to do with the Virtual Console.
2545640	2550400	They did confirm, I mean, we kind of already knew this, but just a confirmation, Game Boy
2550400	2554560	and Game Boy Color games will be coming to the Virtual Console.
2554560	2560000	Super Mario Land is the first confirmed, which, by the way, blows, compared to other Mario
2560000	2561000	games.
2561000	2562400	It's like, it doesn't even play like other Mario games.
2562400	2567440	You don't have a fireball, you have this random ball that bounces off walls, and it's like
2567440	2568680	this Egyptian theme.
2568680	2571400	I don't think it was supposed to be Mario game at first, I think it was supposed to
2571400	2572400	be something else.
2572400	2573400	But whatever.
2573400	2574400	It's like Mr. Do.
2574400	2579840	No, well, okay, yeah, the weapon is, I mean, the gameplay is still like a Mario game, but
2579840	2580840	yeah.
2580840	2583680	So yeah, Super Mario Land is confirmed.
2583680	2588200	No word about advanced games, because keep in mind there's no longer an advanced slot
2588200	2594640	on these things, so no word yet if that's coming in the future or what.
2594640	2595640	So there you go.
2595640	2598800	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
2598800	2600520	Maybe something not about the 3DS?
2600520	2602800	Uh, actually, no.
2602800	2608520	This actually has to do with, well, it has something to do with Nintendo, but not specifically
2608520	2611240	Nintendo's side.
2611240	2616680	Yoshinori Ono, who is the producer of Street Fighter IV, said he wants to make Nintendo
2616680	2619400	vs. Capcom.
2619400	2630320	And he's quoted as saying that he wants to pitch it to Masahiro Sakurai, who is the creator
2630320	2632280	of Super Smash Bros.
2632280	2634600	So I think that that would actually be kind of cool, I mean, they're already doing Marvel
2634600	2640800	vs. Capcom 3, and then we have Tekken in Street Fighter, so who knows?
2640800	2646160	Would you like to have Jigglypuff farting on Blanca or something?
2646160	2647160	That would be really odd.
2647160	2648160	That would be odd.
2648160	2649160	I don't think they would ever do it.
2649160	2650160	No.
2650160	2653680	It would kind of be a dopey game, but in a, I don't know, like I said, there's a lot of
2653680	2658200	dopey games out there, I don't know, I don't necessarily mean that in a bad way.
2658200	2663120	If something's gonna work with Nintendo, it's gonna have to be like a, I think Namco would
2663120	2670440	do it, because all the Tekken games had weird characters like Gon and Yoda.
2670440	2673960	Why don't you just have Mega Man be a character in the next Smash Bros.?
2673960	2676960	I mean, weren't they kind of saying that a while ago anyway?
2676960	2681200	I remember when this last one that came out on the Wii was being teased with all the new
2681200	2685240	characters, because Snake was in it and Sonic was in it, there was rumors for the longest
2685240	2689840	time that Mega Man was also gonna be in it, because I guess there was another third-party
2689840	2695320	character that was in the game or whatever, which ended up being Sonic, I think, and they,
2695320	2698640	you know, people were saying, oh, it's Mega Man, it's gonna be Mega Man, because Capcom
2698640	2700880	and Nintendo have been talking about this for forever.
2700880	2703080	I think that'll be the most that you see come of this.
2703080	2708920	I just think in a full Marvel versus Capcom, or even Tatsunoko versus Capcom kind of way.
2708920	2711760	Unless they do all the cutesy characters.
2711760	2714160	Maybe all the cutesy Capcom characters could do it.
2714160	2715160	Cutesy Capcom battle!
2715160	2719720	Tatsunoko versus Capcom would be awesome with a Mario character or something like that,
2719720	2724440	or I could see them doing maybe, like, Link or something in the Mar- like, they ported
2724440	2728160	Marvel versus Capcom 3 or something to the Wii or something, they could add Link in there
2728160	2729720	and just, like, Soul Calibur.
2729720	2732400	Yeah, that, that maybe, maybe, maybe.
2732400	2734640	Super chibi 3D Capcom fighter!
2734640	2735640	Eeee!
2735640	2737680	Well, that'll be the game that comes with it, and it's all the cute-
2737680	2739320	You know, Capcom did Pacato Fighter!
2739320	2740320	Uh-huh.
2740320	2741840	Yep, so it's been done.
2741840	2745000	It could- anything's possible, I suppose.
2745000	2746000	So.
2746000	2751120	Ed Seton Beaver in our chatroom says, I mean, Capcom characters would fuck up the stupid
2751120	2753000	Nintendo characters.
2753000	2754000	I don't know, though.
2754000	2758640	Couldn't Kirby just go- and, you know, just kind of have his way with the Capcom characters?
2758640	2759640	He does suck.
2759640	2768320	Alright, I don't know, let the fanboy wank begin after that story, but I don't think
2768320	2772720	anything will come of it except maybe in the next Super Smash Bros. game, which will probably
2772720	2773720	be on the 3DS.
2773720	2774720	Just saying.
2774720	2777480	Yeah, and never want to get a big ol' hard-on about it.
2777480	2778480	Mm-hmm.
2778480	2783280	Because, oh my god, you can play it on the Wii, friend code, across galaxies, and locally,
2783280	2785200	and oh my god.
2785200	2786240	And Miis.
2786240	2787240	Watch that.
2787240	2792440	There's gonna be a Super Smash Bros. fighter thingy on the stinkin' DS, and your Mii will
2792440	2793440	be a character.
2793440	2794440	That wasn't in the Wii version?
2794440	2796440	Eh, it might have been, I don't know.
2796440	2797440	It's been-
2797440	2798440	Maybe not, I don't know.
2798440	2800240	It's been years since I've played it at this point.
2800240	2801560	I don't remember.
2801560	2805440	I liked, like, even like the little adventure part of that game.
2805440	2807360	The adventure stuff was cool, I'll give you that.
2807360	2809160	That was a really cool part of the game.
2809160	2810160	So.
2810160	2811960	Alright, let's move on with some release dates.
2811960	2815120	Travel the world and see what's coming out to a console near you.
2815120	2818760	It's not a lot of stuff coming out this week, but there is a couple good things.
2818760	2823840	Dead Space 2 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, as well as the collector's
2823840	2829360	editions with the wonderful replica gun in there.
2829360	2834680	Paws and Claws Marine Rescue on Nintendo DS.
2834680	2844100	Two Worlds 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, as well as the royal edition of that.
2844100	2848320	And Lord of Arcana on PSP.
2848320	2849320	That I believe is it.
2849320	2850320	Alright.
2850320	2852320	I have to take a look here.
2852320	2853320	Yep, that is it.
2853320	2855480	Can we do things a little out of order and go to UK dates?
2855480	2856480	Oh no, nevermind.
2856480	2857480	I, I've, okay.
2857480	2861800	Sorry, my, well my, my thing wasn't loading, but it just popped up, so.
2861800	2863200	I blame your thing.
2863200	2864200	Yes.
2864200	2865200	Stupid thing.
2865200	2867800	Alright, well here we go, Japanese release dates.
2867800	2873280	The Xbox 360 will be getting Monster Hunter Frontier Online Season 10.0 Premium Package.
2873280	2877800	From what I understand, this game is pretty big over there, so it's like, I guess a repackaging
2877800	2880120	a new, new expansion or what have you.
2880120	2881800	Will be coming out on the 26th.
2881800	2886400	Otherwise, some other games that are coming out on the 360 very soon, Dream Club Zero
2886400	2890800	and Galgun are both coming out very soon on the 360 over in Japan.
2890800	2896200	But I hear Galgun actually has a demo for it out there if you do have a Japanese Xbox
2896200	2902720	360 account, which I do, though, huh, I did.
2902720	2904640	I don't, I'd have recovered that account.
2904640	2906240	Well good luck with that.
2906240	2911160	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Dragon Age Origins gets its Japanese release.
2911160	2914360	I mean, I know that's a long time after we had it, but they've probably localized quite
2914360	2915500	a bit for Japan.
2915500	2916600	So it took a little while.
2916600	2921360	Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Mindjack comes out, Shooting Studio and Wizardry Twin
2921360	2922360	Pack.
2922360	2926120	Like, is that like the old school C64 wizardry games?
2926120	2928200	Like a new version of it?
2928200	2929920	They're RPG games.
2929920	2934800	Dude, I think these might be like new versions of that old school game from the 80s.
2934800	2938880	Very, very text heavy in Japanese, though, so you better be fluent in Japanese if you're
2938880	2939880	gonna import that.
2939880	2944080	Did you see that Zork is on good old games now?
2944080	2950880	I had heard about that, but you know, I can't justify paying what they want for Zork.
2950880	2951880	You know what I mean?
2951880	2953360	Plus, I had the whole research.
2953360	2957700	You could play Zork on GameTap, like back when GameTap was cool, when Turner owned it.
2957700	2962520	You could play the Zork games, and you know, I kind of got my fill of retro back then.
2962520	2964620	And now I'm over it.
2964620	2970640	On the Nintendo Wii, huge week on the Wii, huge, gigantic, monumental week on the Wii.
2970640	2972580	The last story comes out this week.
2972580	2974000	That is a huge game.
2974000	2977640	I would be so excited if this game would come out in the US, they have said nothing about
2977640	2978640	it yet.
2978640	2980440	They have said they are not bringing it out.
2980440	2981440	Fuckers!
2981440	2982440	When did they say that?
2982440	2986740	They said that it was Europe, Nintendo Europe was commenting on it.
2986740	2988560	They said they are not bringing it out.
2988560	2990840	Change your fucking mind, because that game needs to come out.
2990840	2996080	I guess the wording is, they have no plans to bring it out yet.
2996080	2999760	Well, you need to change them plans or stop being so coy about whatever you have planned
2999760	3000760	for E3.
3000760	3004840	You know, what are they going to talk about on the Wii at E3 this year?
3004840	3006680	There's nothing to talk about.
3006680	3010160	At least this would be something to hold people over, because again, if you don't know what
3010160	3014440	this game is and why I'm so excited about it, it's a Mistwalker RPG on the Wii.
3014440	3020120	And the graphics actually look pretty phenomenal, you know, compared to the 360 and PS3, considering
3020120	3021120	the Wii's limitations.
3021120	3026220	Mistwalker, of course, the studio that made Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey.
3026220	3030300	And especially with Lost Odyssey, underrated RPG games available on the 360.
3030300	3033560	This is kind of like their foray into the Wii universe.
3033560	3034960	And it's coming out in Japan this week.
3034960	3039340	There's also a Wii bundle that's going to have this, but nothing about when it's coming
3039340	3044920	out over here, if ever, besides that Koi Lo comment that Loki already referenced.
3044920	3049340	Just to, like, kind of put this in perspective, when you look at, like, Japanese releases
3049340	3053060	for February, there are four games.
3053060	3055400	Actually three, because one of them is a collector's pack.
3055400	3056720	Three games coming out in February.
3056720	3058640	Here it is, right here.
3058640	3059640	Nintendo of France.
3059640	3063680	It says they have no plans to localize Last Story.
3063680	3068840	It says, let's see here, no plans at the moment.
3068840	3070760	Don't listen to the guy from France.
3070760	3077720	It says the adaptation of this game could be very long, 12,000 dialogue, or it says
3077720	3080040	it has 12,000 dialogues.
3080040	3082520	Listen up, Nintendo of France.
3082520	3086880	You need to surrender to the idea of having Last Story in English, not French.
3086880	3090120	And their translation teams are overstretched in the short term.
3090120	3096600	I'll tell you what's gonna happen, hackers will do this.
3096600	3097600	Hackers will...
3097600	3098600	Hackers gonna hack.
3098600	3101520	Hackers are gonna translate this.
3101520	3107400	And you know, it will happen, it'll get released, and that'll piss people off.
3107400	3110280	I think, I don't know, I don't trust some guy.
3110280	3115160	If Reggie Fils-Aime had come out and said, it's not happening, then I'd believe it.
3115160	3120040	Some random, you know, executive with Nintendo of France says it, we're all supposed to accept
3120040	3121040	that as the final word.
3121040	3122040	I don't think so.
3122040	3123360	I say no.
3123360	3129600	And then they followed it up with, I fought in your general direction.
3129600	3131520	Stop.
3131520	3134360	Moving on to the DS.
3134360	3137360	Actually not a lot going on on the DS either, but this is a little more understandable
3137360	3139980	of course, because we have 3DS on the horizon in February.
3139980	3145900	But there are a couple puzzle games, and then a game called Sora no Otoshimono Forte Dreamy
3145900	3149320	Season in regular and deluxe editions.
3149320	3154420	It's an adventure game that's coming out with 3 chibi little cartoony babes on the cover.
3154420	3157380	It looks like it might be some type of card game, but I do want to point out that this
3157380	3160060	chick is not wearing pants in the screenshot.
3160060	3161600	She's wearing gym uniform.
3161600	3166380	Whatever, it looks like she's not wearing pants to me.
3166380	3168280	She's not wearing pants, she's wearing shorts.
3168280	3169280	Fine.
3169280	3170280	They're bloomers.
3170280	3171280	They're very short shorts.
3171280	3172280	They're bloomers.
3172280	3173800	Well, they have to be agile.
3173800	3182960	Lastly, on the PS3, I'm sorry, PSP, Toaru Majutsu no Kinsho Mokuroku comes out from
3182960	3188960	ASCII this week, which that game, it's a futuristic world with magic powers.
3188960	3189960	It's a fighting game.
3189960	3193000	It's kind of like Dissada, but just with general characters.
3193000	3194880	But this game might catch some people's attention.
3194880	3197840	Valkyria Chronicles 3, Unrecorded Chronicles.
3197840	3202080	That comes out with PSP this week, so I'm sure that'll have its fans and importers.
3202080	3204800	Okay, now we can go to the UK Dark Sakura.
3204800	3205800	Sorry.
3205800	3206800	Okay.
3206800	3210640	On the 25th, we have Dead Space, for the iPhone, sorry.
3210640	3216800	On the 28th, though, we have Dead Space 2 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360, and Mario Sports Mix
3216800	3221600	and Yogi Bear, the video game.
3221600	3226160	Have you seen the alternate ending, quote unquote, on YouTube where Boo Boo shoots Yogi
3226160	3227160	Bear?
3227160	3231880	It's the alternate ending to the movie.
3231880	3232880	It's great.
3232880	3237360	That would mean you'd have to go see the movie, right?
3237360	3238840	And I would hate to see that movie.
3238840	3241960	No, you don't, you just look it up on YouTube.
3241960	3247440	I understand that, but I don't want to even try to pretend to see that movie or part of
3247440	3248520	the movie.
3248520	3249680	You don't understand, it's awesome.
3249680	3251640	Wait, hold on, here it is, here it is.
3251640	3255680	Here it is.
3255680	3261120	And it's all of the sad music and everything, and Yogi Bear sees the little wanted ad for
3261120	3268720	himself or whatever up on the wall, and there's Boo Boo looking all sad and pointing the gun.
3268720	3270720	Come on.
3270720	3276720	All this sad music, God.
3276720	3279720	By the way, I started it like a minute and a half into it.
3279720	3282720	And then, there you go.
3282720	3283720	Yay.
3283720	3286320	Wait, seriously, who did that?
3286320	3291320	I know, it looks, some people say it might be a viral thing for the movie, that they're
3291320	3295360	saying it's independent, but it was actually like a viral thing, and then there's the bear
3295360	3296360	skin rug.
3296360	3297360	The very end.
3297360	3299560	That's kind of wrong.
3299560	3302520	Dark Sakura's rolling her eyes so far.
3302520	3309560	See, now, if that movie, if that movie had that kind of humor, like it was like an adult
3309560	3316640	movie, you know, with like violence and titties, how do you have titties in a Yogi Bear movie?
3316640	3318040	Who cares?
3318040	3323400	But if you had violence and titties in there, that might be a cool movie.
3323400	3325600	I wouldn't see that.
3325600	3328080	I don't remember titties being in the old cartoon.
3328080	3329080	Exactly.
3329080	3330080	It doesn't matter.
3330080	3331080	Who cares?
3331080	3334840	I don't remember the cartoon being raped across, oh wait, it was now, but I don't remember
3334840	3338600	it being terrible like this.
3338600	3340960	Of course the chat room is asking for a link.
3340960	3345040	I'm trying to get one for you guys right now, but let's get back, do we finish UK dates?
3345040	3346040	I'm sorry.
3346040	3347040	Yes, that's it.
3347040	3348040	Let's get back into some news, Loki.
3348040	3353720	I just don't understand why we can't have violence and titties in Yogi Bear.
3353720	3355600	It makes sense.
3355600	3357600	Think about it.
3357600	3362960	There was an Xbox 360 dashboard update this week, which pissed me off because that delayed
3362960	3367360	me from playing my Grand Theft Auto game for a good half an hour, because our internet's
3367360	3372040	really slow, and the first thing I was worrying about is, is console amusement going to get
3372040	3379480	banned because it's flash and not hot swapped like the rest of them, because I got lazy.
3379480	3380800	But no, that wasn't the case.
3380800	3391420	It was actually a small update to restore, I guess, the planned launch or whatever, basically
3391420	3395680	the option where you can have the disc and the drive, and when you start the system up,
3395680	3399320	it'll actually play the game instead of going to the dashboard, and it was something I guess
3399320	3403120	that broke in the last dashboard update.
3403120	3408160	And they will have a second update later this week, because I guess they just didn't have
3408160	3417560	time to finish the update, to darken, I guess, your gamertag pictures or whatever it's going
3417560	3423440	to be, instead of it being on green or something, now it's on dark gray, which is stupid.
3423440	3424440	Oh, and the other thing-
3424440	3425440	What a change.
3425440	3431840	Yeah, and the other thing is, it also broke the ability to play backups of Call of Duty
3431840	3438160	Black Ops, Mario Warfare 2, and of course, Halo Reach.
3438160	3440080	Also known as the real reason.
3440080	3442280	Yes, the real reason.
3442280	3449480	What it did was it added the, what was it, the API 2.5 checks, I think that's what they're
3449480	3457000	calling them, it's a new, I guess, authenticity check that they've been adding to some new
3457000	3466920	games to make sure they're not backed up, and if, for example, you're playing one of
3466920	3470720	these games and it happens to be backed up, your console gets flagged for banning on the
3470720	3471720	next-
3471720	3472720	We ban you.
3472720	3476720	The next go around.
3476720	3485480	Finally, it doesn't always, well, they have the new light touch firmwares for the DVD
3485480	3486920	drives already.
3486920	3494680	This is back when the first dashboard updates came out, or actually the new checks and stuff
3494680	3498960	came out, and they've already patched it out on these drives, assuming you have your drive
3498960	3502920	up to date, modded and stuff, and there's some drives that actually don't support this
3502920	3506140	at all, so it doesn't matter, you can patch it all you want, but they can still play backups
3506140	3508720	all they want and there's no way for them to check.
3508720	3509720	So that really sucks.
3509720	3516760	Oh, and there's ways also to patch your games so that they're not checked by this too.
3516760	3520720	But at least they'll get a good chunk of the people that are playing that.
3520720	3526220	Me on the other hand, I'm safe for now because I'm not playing Black Ops or Modern Warfare
3526220	3531880	2 or Halo Reach, and unfortunately I don't think they're gonna be checking episodes of
3531880	3532880	Liberty City.
3532880	3538000	Granted, I am playing on a legit copy of episodes from Liberty City, but my drive is flashed
3538000	3539000	in one of my consoles.
3539000	3540000	Naughty, naughty.
3540000	3541000	It's for testing.
3541000	3542000	Of course.
3542000	3543760	Because my J-Tag's broken!
3543760	3545800	I have to test it on that right now.
3545800	3549360	Alright, I'm looking at our chatroom for some comments, and of course everybody's lit up
3549360	3553920	about the adult Yogi Bear movie, and Salacious Pop is practically writing the movie right
3553920	3555680	now in some of the chatroom comments.
3555680	3557920	Hey, uh, boo-boo!
3557920	3560000	Don't boguard all the coke, boo-boo!
3560000	3561480	Fuck you, Yogi!
3561480	3565600	Hey, no bears allowed in the strip club, violent mauling.
3565600	3566760	What did you do to my car?
3566760	3569680	Yeah, you know that saying about bears only shitting in woods?
3569680	3570680	It's wrong.
3570680	3571680	Puts on aviator shades.
3571680	3572680	Yeah.
3572680	3577600	That would be awesome.
3577600	3581680	Act deaf to her chatroom says, boo-boo has a right to bear arms.
3581680	3582680	Get it?
3582680	3585680	That's it, I'm, bye.
3585680	3598680	Ladies and gentlemen, it took 398, 398 weeks, but this show has officially driven Dark Sakura
3598680	3600720	to the brink of sanity.
3600720	3601840	To madness.
3601840	3605040	I had sanity, ever.
3605040	3606040	That's true.
3606040	3610520	Alright, uh, moving on, one other quick story for you guys, and then we're gonna get to
3610520	3612300	the classic game of the week.
3612300	3614280	Take it back to the old school way.
3614280	3618840	Don't kick it back 14 years right now, remember when they originally announced Duke Nukem
3618840	3619840	Forever?
3619840	3624680	Oh boy, yes, that's right, Duke Nukem Forever was that game that was announced before some
3624680	3627480	of you were probably born.
3627480	3632920	This game was supposed to come out, and now it finally has a release date.
3632920	3637760	That's right, it was published in the latest Game Informer magazine, May 3rd, 2011, or
3637760	3642920	2011, whatever you want to say, is the new release date for Duke Nukem Forever.
3642920	3646000	That is what Gearbox Software is aiming for.
3646000	3648760	You know, of course, obviously they're really hyping up this release now, it's like the
3648760	3655760	game that was never gonna happen, but honestly, guys, once this game kind of changed hands,
3655760	3659080	it's happened pretty quickly, and I think it's not surprising that really all it took
3659080	3663520	was getting it away from 3D Realms and giving it to someone else.
3663520	3667080	Hopefully the game, I mean, I don't mean to disrespect 3D Realms, but damn, you never
3667080	3668080	did anything.
3668080	3669080	Did you see the trailer?
3669080	3670920	Actually, I didn't see the full trailer.
3670920	3671920	It's funny.
3671920	3673200	Well, let me take a look here.
3673200	3674200	It's just, when's your birthday?
3674200	3675200	When's your birthday?
3675200	3680160	All right, I'm gonna say I was born in 1931, because that's where my mouse clicked first.
3680160	3681720	February 1st, 1931.
3681720	3682720	Here we go.
3682720	3683720	Fresh and white.
3683720	3684720	Try mine.
3684720	3685720	It whitens.
3685720	3687200	Don't show me these goddamn ads.
3687200	3688200	Just go to Kotaku.
3688200	3689200	Seriously.
3689200	3690200	All right, hold on.
3690200	3691200	Joysick.
3691200	3693560	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
3693560	3695600	It's gonna be done in a second anyway.
3695600	3701840	Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do, okay, here we go.
3701840	3708640	A to M, of course.
3708640	3710520	All these establishing shots of...
3710520	3714520	They used to tell stories of a man who saved the world.
3714520	3718520	A man whose very presence sent aliens running back to their mother ships.
3718520	3719520	A man who disappeared without a trace.
3719520	3720520	When the invaders came back, they came back angry.
3720520	3740920	They tore our planet apart bit by bit, but they made one mistake.
3740920	3743120	They shouldn't have gone after our women.
3743120	3748560	Damn it, why do they always take the hot ones?
3748560	3750600	You want it.
3750600	3751600	Nice.
3751600	3755200	The captions are the best part.
3755200	3758960	You need it.
3758960	3763520	Did he just punch that alien in the face?
3763520	3765520	Yes.
3765520	3767920	Awesome.
3767920	3769320	And now.
3769320	3772320	Rest in pieces.
3772320	3775560	We're fucking bringing it.
3775560	3776960	Nice.
3776960	3778680	What?
3778680	3784640	Did you think I was gone forever?
3784640	3790280	Did they get the original voice actor?
3790280	3792280	It sounds like it.
3792280	3794280	Hell, I'd still hit it.
3794280	3805680	It's this big giant alien with three doobs.
3805680	3807200	He's peeing.
3807200	3809800	That's lovely.
3809800	3811480	That's nice.
3811480	3813440	That's going on for way too long in this trailer.
3813440	3816440	I'll be done soon.
3816440	3817440	Really?
3817440	3820440	Oh, how'd it go?
3820440	3821440	Nice.
3821440	3822440	I like the vehicle drive.
3822440	3823440	I think it was cool.
3823440	3838800	It should be good, because this guy just did it out of order land.
3838800	3839800	Yeah.
3839800	3840800	Coochie coochie.
3840800	3841800	Hail to the king, baby.
3841800	3842800	What about the game, Duke?
3842800	3843800	Was it any good?
3843800	3850800	Yeah, but after 12 fucking years, it should be.
3850800	3851800	Nice.
3851800	3854600	Very cute.
3854600	3857200	With the minute I heard it was going to the guys that made Borderlands, I was like, okay,
3857200	3858840	it's in capable hands.
3858840	3863200	I'm curious to see how the game plays, like a first level walkthrough type of video or
3863200	3866400	something, which I'm sure probably exists out there from the Penny Arcade Expo where
3866400	3867720	they brought it.
3867720	3873720	But yeah, it looks like it's keeping that same sense of humor, and definitely not holding
3873720	3876280	back on the tits and ass.
3876280	3877280	That's nice to see.
3877280	3883880	I remember reading that everything that's blurred out or bleeped out is actually going
3883880	3884880	to be in the game.
3884880	3885880	Nice.
3885880	3886880	Very nice.
3886880	3892160	Let's see, our chat room is oversharing as they're watching this trailer here with us.
3892160	3897040	Ed Seton Beaver in our chat room says, I am touching myself to the trailer.
3897040	3902760	Defective Candy says, I have quite literally been waiting for this game my whole life.
3902760	3907080	Bonds006 says, punching it in the face never gets old.
3907080	3908080	That's right.
3908080	3909960	Or is it punching ET?
3909960	3914320	It's not Scott Pilgrim, it's Prodigy, okay?
3914320	3916120	It's the Prodigy.
3916120	3917120	Not Scott Pilgrim.
3917120	3921440	Yes, it was in that trailer, but it's the Prodigy.
3921440	3924600	There's also a cage match pick that won a couple times.
3924600	3925600	That's right.
3925600	3926760	All right, let's get into the classic game of the week.
3926760	3929800	Enough about this stuff that you had to wait 14 years for.
3929800	3931600	How about something that was out 14 years ago?
3931600	3932600	I think it's 12 years.
3932600	3933600	Whatever.
3933600	3934600	He said 12 years.
3934600	3935600	I'm going by Duke.
3935600	3936600	Fine.
3936600	3937600	It's like 13.
3937600	3938600	It's like...
3938600	3939600	Oh, shut up.
3939600	3942560	All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.
3942560	3947040	Fine, excite me with a classic game.
3947040	3950160	The classic game of the week is Power Stone 2.
3950160	3952320	Specifically Power Stone 2.
3952320	3953920	That is a pretty fucking rad game, actually.
3953920	3954920	Power Stone 1.
3954920	3958320	Power Stone was great, but Power Stone 2 made all kinds of fun improvements over the first
3958320	3959320	one.
3959320	3962880	So first of all, it's got all of the characters from the first Power Stone, and it's basically
3962880	3969060	a four-player fighting game, and it's just so much fun.
3969060	3970700	You have all kinds of different gameplay.
3970700	3974080	You've got the one-on-one, which is like the original.
3974080	3976700	It's a two-character storyline game.
3976700	3981280	You have arcade mode, which is a four-character storyline game, and two characters advance
3981280	3982280	per round.
3982280	3986440	Then you have original, which is multiplayer, so you can pick stages and everything.
3986440	3988120	It's a fun party game.
3988120	3992720	And then adventure that has an unpredictable storyline, and you can collect cards, items,
3992720	3994440	and money.
3994440	3999720	So yeah, it's got five different stages, and the boss stages, and all kinds of different
3999720	4000720	fun stuff.
4000720	4006680	You've got the desert stage that has the Pharaoh Walker, and all kinds of neat things, but
4006680	4007680	all of the...
4007680	4012880	It even had secret characters like Pride Falcon and Mel, and in the PSP version, you also
4012880	4016680	get Kraken and Valgus back from the first game, so that was pretty cool.
4016680	4018160	I like Jack.
4018160	4019160	Yeah.
4019160	4026600	I think Jack was cool, although I think for Dan, he was always using Foker, or as they
4026600	4033120	had him in the U.S. one, Falcon, but you know, because Foker's like Roy Foker from lacrosse.
4033120	4034720	That's what he always said, so.
4034720	4037160	Or he's a real mother Foker.
4037160	4039040	I would always use Ayame.
4039040	4040520	That was me.
4040520	4047160	But yeah, you can, you know, the stages will change, you know, as you do it.
4047160	4051880	Like when you've got an airplane stage, the plane will start falling apart, and the characters
4051880	4057520	will battle as they skydive, and floating platforms, and all kinds of different stuff,
4057520	4061520	so there's sort of like little sub-levels in each level, and you can get different items
4061520	4067840	like flamethrowers, and giant hammers, and bear traps, and a magazine, and you know,
4067840	4073200	you get food, and invisibility, and wings, and all kinds of fun stuff.
4073200	4079160	And you can, you know, drop bombs and icebergs at people, so, really cool, but you've got
4079160	4084680	like the bad guys, like I said, Pharaoh Walker and Dr. Erode, Dr. Erode is cool, and he has
4084680	4091320	a power stone of his own, but you know, you get the different stones and you can like
4091320	4095640	do super powered up forms and that type of thing, it was pretty neat.
4095640	4103200	And on the Dreamcast, now, this was in the adventure mode, you had like an item shop,
4103200	4108560	and you could, you know, get different things, and actually the secret character Mel ran
4108560	4113960	the item shop, and with the VMU, it had this thing called the mini book, that you can look
4113960	4119040	at your player's item inventory, you can trade items with other players, and you can register
4119040	4124120	things in your inventory as handy items that appear in original mode, so they give you
4124120	4125800	this advantage.
4125800	4132760	And if you put the CD, the disc in a CD player, then it plays the same message, well, it plays
4132760	4137160	the same message that was used on the Dreamcast one, except there's piano music with it.
4137160	4139720	And that's a power stone too.
4139720	4140960	Awesome.
4140960	4142840	Dreamcast!
4142840	4146520	I played a lot of this on the Dreamcast actually, I actually had this game, this is one of the
4146520	4149840	few games that you've mentioned from Sega that I actually played a lot of when I was
4149840	4150840	a kid.
4150840	4151840	Oh yeah.
4151840	4152840	This is a fun game.
4152840	4153840	I love this game.
4153840	4155600	This is not really there, is it?
4155600	4156600	No, it should be.
4156600	4158080	They should do a new power stone.
4158080	4161120	With this Dreamcast resurgence, that would be awesome, because I know this is a Capcom
4161120	4162440	game, not Sega, but still.
4162440	4165240	We need a new power stone.
4165240	4166240	And how?
4166240	4167240	With eight players.
4167240	4168240	Absolutely.
4168240	4172000	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Power Stone 2.
4172000	4173000	Good choice, Dark Soccer.
4173000	4174000	Very good choice.
4174000	4177040	All right, we're gonna go to a break, guys, it's that time of the show where we take a
4177040	4178040	break.
4178040	4180180	We'll be back though, there's plenty more Orange Laundry to come, we haven't even talked
4180180	4182760	about some of the things that were announced at the Square Enix event this week which we're
4182760	4183760	gonna get into.
4183760	4187080	A little more news about Duke Nukem Forever, believe it or not, a story about the Rock
4187080	4189800	Band Network and some things going on with Apple.
4189800	4193600	And we have to talk about what's going on with the PlayStation hack case, because there's
4193600	4194600	more developments.
4194600	4198920	We'll get into all that, plus a story involving boobs, and it's not even a Yogi Bear related
4198920	4199920	thing.
4199920	4200920	We've got all that after the break.
4200920	4205640	We'll be right back with your Twitter topics, emails, or lack thereof, and more in just
4205640	4213560	a little bit here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4213560	4216040	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4216040	4224760	We are live on this Sunday, January 23rd of 2011 for the 398th episode of our little program.
4224760	4227880	And we've got plenty more news coming up, some rapid-fire news in just a moment, but
4227880	4231600	we quickly wanna give some plugs for some other shows that we work on.
4231600	4233920	Every week, Dark Sakura has a show that she does.
4233920	4234920	Yes.
4234920	4235920	With her buddies.
4235920	4241080	Comic Insanity, and you can find it on infamous.net, that's N-F-A-M-O-U-S, and we have a Twitter
4241080	4243080	for Comic Insanity as well.
4243080	4247280	And speaking of Dark Sakura, she was the special guest on a special live episode of the show
4247280	4249420	that I do with Xtaphir.
4249420	4250420	It's called Horde House.
4250420	4254700	The best little Horde House in Azeroth, you can guess it's all about the World of Warcraft.
4254700	4255700	Fun times.
4255700	4256700	It was very fun.
4256700	4257700	I had a good time.
4257700	4258700	Good.
4258700	4259700	Excellent.
4259700	4260700	We had a good time doing it.
4260700	4261700	So check those out.
4261700	4262700	Both available on iTunes.
4262700	4265840	Comic Insanity, that's the letter N, no I in front, and Horde House.
4265840	4270400	You can find those both on iTunes or whatever podcasting directory it is that you use.
4270400	4272760	Let's get into some rapid-fire news, and then the Twitter topics.
4272760	4274280	You got just a couple minutes to lock those in.
4274280	4277360	Twitter.com slash O-L-R for the Twitter topics.
4277360	4279240	First, some quick news.
4279240	4280240	Yes.
4280240	4287200	There's a rumor that an official software development kit for Windows is coming before
4287200	4293240	the Kinect, and they're saying it could actually be coming within the next few months, which,
4293240	4297540	if you think about it, would time just perfectly with Game Developer Conference, and wouldn't
4297540	4301560	that be something that they would probably want at Game Developer Conference?
4301560	4302560	Maybe?
4302560	4303560	A little bit?
4303560	4304560	Good theory?
4304560	4312480	It says, apparently, this is coming from a website WinRumors, sources are familiar with
4312480	4320080	the plans, and that a, I guess, official software development kit and Kinect drivers are being
4320080	4327120	prepped for a beta release in the coming months, potentially arriving with the upcoming XNA
4327120	4332640	update dubbed Community Technical Preview, and the report, I guess they're saying that
4332640	4338980	there's statements being made by Microsoft's head Steve Ballmer earlier this month saying
4338980	4346160	that the Kinect support would be coming to PC in a formal way in the right time.
4346160	4349860	Makes sense that it would be at something like Game Developers Conference.
4349860	4353960	My bet would be that's when it's coming out, you'll probably see an update to XNA and stuff
4353960	4357000	like that around that time as well.
4357000	4362360	You get support for, I mean it's good anyways, because you get support for the XNA stuff
4362360	4366680	for PC stuff, and for the indie games.
4366680	4372360	I'd really like to see what the indie games do with Kinect, it'd be very interesting.
4372360	4373360	And scary at the same time.
4373360	4380160	Yes, it could be very scary as well, true.
4380160	4383200	Pixel Force Halo is now free to download.
4383200	4388920	This is the Halo demake by Eric Ruth, who you may remember ran into a little bit of
4388920	4395480	trouble with his last demake of DJ Hero, but this time though it's kind of a side scroller
4395480	4398480	shooter game, so go check it out.
4398480	4414400	And you can find that on I guess bigdownload.com slash games slash pixel dash force dash halo slash pc slash pixel dash force dot halo dot dash free dash game.
4414400	4417920	Or just do a damn Google search for it, because it's probably a lot easier than writing that
4417920	4420840	all down.
4420840	4427760	And then last but not least, speaking of DJ Hero, DJ Hero 2 has added some new trans anthems
4427760	4436900	this week, and you can get these for $8 or 640 Microsoft points, and they are also available
4436900	4441640	separately on the Wii for 300 points a pop.
4441640	4450560	And with that you get Foreign Angel by Paul Van Dyke mixed with 9 PM Til I Come by ATB.
4450560	4454960	Which even though that song I don't really consider like a trans anthem, I do remember
4454960	4456880	that it was on a bunch.
4456880	4459320	And apparently that song is remixed as well, my bad.
4459320	4465720	It was on a bunch of trans albums back when I was buying CDs a long time ago.
4465720	4473000	Not Over by Paul Oakenfold featuring Ryan Tedder, and Punk by Ferry Corson versus Imagine
4473000	4477680	by Armin van Buren, so sounds cool.
4477680	4481840	I didn't pick up the pack yet, I don't know, $8 is a lot for something I'll probably play
4481840	4485040	once and then go heck cool, you know what I mean.
4485040	4488520	Oh I'll pick up the pack eventually, I bet you will.
4488520	4491760	Alright, moving on to some other quick news.
4491760	4495680	An interesting other sequel announced to a game I kind of thought everybody hated but
4495680	4496680	I guess not.
4496680	4500840	99 Nights, remember this game, it was out on the Xbox 360, and there was even a sequel
4500840	4501840	to it that came out.
4501840	4506160	I played the original, it's not terrible, it's just not great either.
4506160	4510580	So I never even bothered with the sequel, but apparently they've decided to justify
4510580	4515320	a, get ready for this, MMO, 99 Nights Online.
4515320	4521000	It's an action MMO, Q Entertainment has announced that they are doing this for the PC.
4521000	4525000	There will be a number of RPG elements in this, meaning there will be different job
4525000	4530000	classes, there will be PVP, you can party up with other players, and of course, hack
4530000	4534300	hack slash slash and all the button mashing you are used to from the originals.
4534300	4539240	It will be a free to play game, so that's pretty cool, microtransactions of course,
4539240	4541480	that's how these things work these days.
4541480	4546840	No word on when this game will announce in North America, if at all, obviously this is
4546840	4549800	going to be in other countries first.
4549800	4555280	There you go, Portal 2, big news on Portal 2 this week.
4555280	4559560	Portal 2 has announced that when it comes to the PS3, it's going to have cross platform
4559560	4562260	chat between the PS3 and the PC.
4562260	4567380	That includes multiplayer as well, and get this, you buy the game on the PS3, you're
4567380	4570140	going to get the Steam version for free.
4570140	4574560	If you link your PSN and your Steam accounts, you will get the Steam Play version of Portal
4574560	4577120	2 free, because you have the PS3 game.
4577120	4582320	So, boy did they just sell many more copies of the Playstation 3 version of this game,
4582320	4587260	at least versus the Xbox 360, which is really what Sony wanted at their conference I'm sure
4587260	4591800	when they came out and announced this whole new friendship they now have with Valve.
4591800	4597040	So they are also saying with this, a quote from Gabe Newell from Valve, quote, we hope
4597040	4602240	to expand upon the foundation being laid in Portal 2 with more Steam features and functionality
4602240	4607080	in DLC and future content releases.
4607080	4610120	Could be very interesting for the future of these two companies working together.
4610120	4613920	By the way, Cloud Based Storage will also be working on the PS3, which I think they
4613920	4618080	had announced before, but it's kind of interesting to see how that's all going to work with the
4618080	4621000	PC integration as well.
4621000	4624840	One other quick story here, and I mean quick.
4624840	4627160	You know there's a new Justin Bieber movie coming out?
4627160	4628920	Yeah, I know right?
4628920	4634680	Think of how I felt when I had to see that trailer before I went and saw Tangled.
4634680	4639160	Well you know what, you got to give Nintendo props, because they wanted to use a 15 second
4639160	4643960	clip of the Super Mario Brothers theme song in the new Justin Bieber movie, and Nintendo
4643960	4646800	said no.
4646800	4647800	Nintendo said no.
4647800	4648800	Thank you, Poop.
4648800	4649800	We'll decline your offer.
4649800	4650800	Because cereal's more important.
4650800	4655000	Yes, funny enough, I remember back in the day there was Nintendo underwear you could
4655000	4656000	order from the magazine.
4656000	4659120	And you think of how bad of an idea that was?
4659120	4660120	This is much worse.
4660120	4661120	Yeah, that's right.
4661120	4662120	It's like Underoos.
4662120	4668360	Oh yes, we may have made a failing cereal brand, and we may have hoarded out our brands
4668360	4676160	to all sorts of different merchandise out there, but no, we are drawing the line here.
4676160	4677640	Fuck off, Justin Bieber.
4677640	4679760	There you go.
4679760	4681520	They probably just didn't cough up enough money.
4681520	4684120	I'm sure that's what these things usually go down to.
4684120	4689800	You put the Zelda theme inside, you know, Scott Pilgrim, yeah, but that was a decent
4689800	4690800	movie.
4690800	4692440	And it didn't start Justin Bieber.
4692440	4693440	Justine.
4693440	4696800	It didn't start Cute Little Lesbian.
4696800	4700360	Alright, let's move on with more stories, Dark Sakura.
4700360	4707040	Well for fans of Bejeweled Blitz, it looks like Bejeweled Blitz Live is going to have
4707040	4711480	16 player online play with the Xbox Live Arcade.
4711480	4713280	So that's pretty cool.
4713280	4714480	Lots of people can play.
4714480	4717000	It's going to be crazy go nuts.
4717000	4721400	And Dance Dance Revolution is having download content.
4721400	4723000	Yay.
4723000	4729720	There's a greatest hits pack that's got Paranoia, Brilliant to You, AM3P, Trip Machine, Put
4729720	4730720	Your Faith in Me.
4730720	4733560	And there's a premium pack that's free.
4733560	4738480	This is Let's Get Away, Dreaming Can Make a Wish Come True, and Private Eye.
4738480	4740400	And just a whole bunch of stuff.
4740400	4741520	There's a lot of stuff on here.
4741520	4746000	There's Economics Greatest Hits, which has Be For You, Hire, Burn on the Floor, Hysteria,
4746000	4747800	Trip Machine.
4747800	4748800	Really cool.
4748800	4752520	I think that these are worthy packets.
4752520	4754960	So hoorah.
4754960	4768880	And also there is video out that has two more characters for Super Street Fighter IV.
4768880	4772120	There is Evil Ryu and Oni Akuma.
4772120	4773480	So that's pretty cool.
4773480	4776480	Which I kind of saw coming anyway.
4776480	4777480	Looking forward to that.
4777480	4778480	Yeah there's video out.
4778480	4781720	It hasn't been officially confirmed, but dude there's video so whatever.
4781720	4783480	He's got red glowing eyes.
4783480	4784480	It's Evil Ryu.
4784480	4785480	Yeah.
4785480	4787920	They have some better screenshots out there too.
4787920	4788920	Yeah.
4788920	4789920	Like that.
4789920	4790920	Yeah.
4790920	4791920	It's...
4791920	4792920	Yeah.
4792920	4793920	It's official.
4793920	4794920	As official as it gets.
4794920	4800480	And his moves are the same ones that he had in Alpha 2.
4800480	4801480	And Alpha 3.
4801480	4802480	So.
4802480	4803480	Whatever.
4803480	4804480	It's all...
4804480	4805480	Let's see.
4805480	4806720	This is what it's about.
4806720	4807720	Arcade Unlocks.
4807720	4808720	I love that shit.
4808720	4809720	Yeah.
4809720	4813080	I love that shit when it was around with DDR Max 2.
4813080	4816040	They got people, got asses in the seats as they would say.
4816040	4817040	You know.
4817040	4818040	Got people to the arcade.
4818040	4819040	Well.
4819040	4820040	Fans of DDR.
4820040	4824680	Because I'm sure people that play Street Fighter don't give a shit about DDR.
4824680	4826920	But that's what they need to do.
4826920	4830200	That's pretty, pretty badass.
4830200	4831440	Are we ready to get to the tweets?
4831440	4834360	It looks like actually they're just calling him Oni.
4834360	4836880	I'll take that as a no.
4836880	4838960	Which kind of makes sense because...
4838960	4839960	Anyway.
4839960	4840960	Okay.
4840960	4841960	We have tweets.
4841960	4842960	No I know.
4842960	4845200	I remember when Oni mode in DDR was a big deal.
4845200	4846600	And everybody was like, what does Oni mean?
4846600	4847600	Oni means ogre.
4847600	4848600	Oh, ogre.
4848600	4849600	So.
4849600	4850600	Alright.
4850600	4852600	Now let's get to the tweets.
4852600	4853600	Tweet tweet.
4853600	4857400	Every week we invite you guys to show us your tweets at twitter.com slash olr and it'll
4857400	4861240	invoke some discussion here on our lovely program and you guys sent quite a few tweets
4861240	4862240	tonight.
4862240	4864240	So we'll start it off with retertainment.
4864240	4867960	Jumping ahead a little bit here but I'll go ahead since most people know about this already.
4867960	4872320	Final Fantasy XIII-2, shouldn't they be putting their attention towards fixing the fuck up
4872320	4873800	that is Final Fantasy XIV?
4873800	4876320	Yes, but that's going to take some time.
4876320	4881560	Seriously, Final Fantasy XIV relaunch in the US at least Christmas.
4881560	4882560	If not later.
4882560	4884080	Uh, I guess later.
4884080	4885080	Really?
4885080	4886080	It's a broken mess.
4886080	4889600	Well, it is a hot mess but they could do an expansion pack and fix a lot.
4889600	4890600	Hopefully.
4890600	4891600	Like, you know, add an auction house.
4891600	4892600	Among other things.
4892600	4895600	If they expand it, it's more stuff to fix.
4895600	4896600	It's true.
4896600	4898100	Alright, let's see.
4898100	4903520	Spazinator PSM, there are rumors that an MGS HD collection is in the works.
4903520	4904960	A Metal Gear Solid HD collection.
4904960	4905960	I wouldn't be surprised.
4905960	4906960	It's a trend.
4906960	4907960	I wouldn't either.
4907960	4910680	We've got two already coming out in March.
4910680	4913840	We've got the Tomb Raider and the Prince of Persia.
4913840	4915360	Ah, good point.
4915360	4918160	So, and they just had the Sly collection.
4918160	4920640	It's popular nowadays.
4920640	4924200	Moving on to another tweet from Spazinator, kind of keeping us up to date on the video
4924200	4925200	releases.
4925200	4929760	Pilots to Being Human, Perfect Couples, and Fairly Legal are free on Xbox Live, while
4929760	4932960	Perfect Couples and Fairly Legal are free on PlayStation Network.
4932960	4935240	If you'd like to sample new TV shows or whatever.
4935240	4936240	I know.
4936240	4937240	I have no interest in this.
4937240	4939360	No, I have a problem with Being Human.
4939360	4940360	What is, I don't even know.
4940360	4941360	What is that show?
4941360	4942360	Okay, it was a show.
4942360	4945680	I've watched the first two seasons of it on BBC America.
4945680	4949160	It's a show about, no it's not a comedy.
4949160	4950160	No, a copy show.
4950160	4954360	Yeah, it's about a vampire, a ghost, and a werewolf that live in the same flat.
4954360	4956040	Sounds like the beginning of a joke.
4956040	4960000	I've said the same thing, but it's actually a really good show, at least the British one
4960000	4961000	is.
4961000	4963740	I've heard the American one is not so good.
4963740	4966680	You know, but sometimes they bring shows over from Britain and they're not so bad.
4966680	4969880	Like All in the Family, which is like, you know, a huge American show from the 70s, that
4969880	4971280	was a British show to begin with.
4971280	4973600	Sometimes, and The Office has been on for years and years.
4973600	4978220	I still prefer the British one, but you know, it just depends.
4978220	4982320	Usually they'll start the same and then kind of branch off in different directions, but
4982320	4983320	I don't know.
4983320	4985880	If there's this show, I don't know how far do I want to get into this.
4985880	4987800	Have you heard about that Skins show?
4987800	4990680	It's big in the UK, but they made it here on MTV.
4990680	4993080	Like I have zero interest in that show.
4993080	4994080	Zero.
4994080	4996680	Actually, if there's a number less than zero, I have that amount of interest.
4996680	4997680	Negative infinity?
4997680	5003120	Negative infinity is my interest level for that, but I can't get away from it on my entertainment
5003120	5005960	gossip websites, which pisses me off.
5005960	5013280	Act Def sends us a tweet, hey, it's about the PSP2, a little rumor, 3G connectivity
5013280	5015720	and a very fancy screen on the PSP2.
5015720	5020120	If this tweet from Act Def is to be believed where he links us to a story on Kotaku, apparently
5020120	5027040	it's a report from Nikkei that the portable in Japan will be on the NTT Docomo network
5027040	5029840	via 3G.
5029840	5035400	Could that mean like this is going to be like T-Mobile's answer to the iPhone or I don't
5035400	5038320	know, I'm pulling that out of my ass, but one of the providers that doesn't have the
5038320	5040520	iPhone, maybe they'll have the PSP2.
5040520	5041520	Interesting.
5041520	5047720	They're not saying anything about phone, just 3G connection, kind of like an iPad.
5047720	5050720	That would be interesting because that means you could play multiplayer anywhere you go.
5050720	5053520	What would you think about 3G on the PSP2?
5053520	5055360	Would that be cool for you, Loki?
5055360	5056920	Would you like that?
5056920	5062680	Here's what it comes down to, and this is with any 3G gaming app, 3G means I need a
5062680	5068240	fucking subscription for a data plan to somewhere, and that's the killer right there.
5068240	5075480	I mean, unless it's included in the price of that system, it's going to be fucking expensive
5075480	5081880	because you're going to have to pay another $100 a month or $60 a month to play your stupid
5081880	5082880	system.
5082880	5091880	Wi-Fi, no, no thanks, but then again, if I can do it via Wi-Fi, that's fine, I'll just
5091880	5093840	tether it to my phone.
5093840	5099120	Alright, uh, Sturlok sends us a tweet, Crimson Echoes finally leaked, suck it Square, and
5099120	5101400	then links us to the story, and I was like, what's Crimson Echoes?
5101400	5108440	Oh yes, it's the fan-made Chrono Trigger sequel, so the fan-made Chrono Trigger sequel finally
5108440	5111480	leaked out to the internet, which we all knew it would, this is the one Square Enix shut
5111480	5115400	down not that long ago, we all knew it, once it hits the internet it's out, and sure enough
5115400	5116720	that's what happened.
5116720	5121120	Crimson Echoes made its way out, apparently also a game called Flames of Eternity got
5121120	5125680	leaked, which was I guess a branch-off of the same title, so there you go.
5125680	5128560	By the way, I'm looking at the fighting in this game, it looks like Final Fantasy VI,
5128560	5132480	it's kind of interesting, maybe it's like a really elaborate ROM hack or something,
5132480	5133640	I don't know.
5133640	5141360	Alright, uh, let's move on to, uh, Defective Candy, I like this, sent us a tweet, Connect
5141360	5145680	hacked for surgical robot, what?
5145680	5150320	A group of graduate students at the University of Washington have modified the firmware and
5150320	5160240	software of the Connect to guide the actions of surgical robots, wow, and it gets into
5160240	5164560	more of the details of this, I'm looking for some quotes here, I'm just seeing this story
5164560	5166080	for the first time.
5166080	5170800	The hacked unit adds the sense of touch and feeds information to the surgeon, the setup
5170800	5176320	could save $50,000 on the standard rig used to perform non-invasive surgery.
5176320	5181520	We could define basically a force field around, say, a liver, if the surgeon got too close
5181520	5184760	he would run into that force field and it would protect the object he didn't want to
5184760	5187480	cut, that's weird.
5187480	5193160	But then, what about the day the machines take over, do you really want a machine operating
5193160	5194160	on you?
5194160	5195160	Cyberdyne!
5195160	5203800	Exactly, Skynet, alright, a couple tweets from Tigerclaw, Telltale Games strongly hints
5203800	5209080	at doing the Walking Dead game, I guess really the title says it all but we're linked to
5209080	5214360	a story there, The Walking Dead is a show on AMC, and it was a comic book series that
5214360	5218120	now is this big TV show, I know a few people that are into this, I haven't watched this,
5218120	5222880	but apparently Telltale Games is hinting that perhaps they're doing something on this, and
5222880	5227400	that was, well Telltale's got a big event going on, they're going to be talking about
5227400	5232680	five new multi-platform efforts, and I'm assuming Jurassic Park of course is one of those, they're
5232680	5237740	also saying one of the titles announced is based on a just launched property from the
5237740	5243120	TV and comic book world whose popularity is changing life as some know it, so some people
5243120	5248040	are inferring that from that, sounds like we'll find out in a month, could be interesting.
5248040	5251800	And then Zeba sends us a couple tweets as well, the Kinect hacker that made himself
5251800	5255560	into a bunch of Minecraft monuments has now put those monuments in motion, weren't you
5255560	5259000	saying something about this, it was during the break or right at the end of part A, I
5259000	5260000	don't remember?
5260000	5265760	I was just saying that, we were talking about this like a couple weeks ago, oh was it?
5265760	5270920	Well there you go, apparently this is a Minecraft monument where now it moves, I still have
5270920	5274880	never played Minecraft, does that make me a bad gamer, or just lazy, nope, I haven't
5274880	5279940	done it either, weird, yeah apparently the Minecraft monument moves at 30 frames a second
5279940	5284400	while he juggles three balls, which I guess if you had to kind of create this like bit
5284400	5286880	by bit, it's probably a pain in the ass, you know what's better though?
5286880	5291400	But it's the one that they have where it's a cat chasing a laser.
5291400	5296200	Mnzeba also sent us a tweet about this, a letter from the Final Fantasy XIV producer
5296200	5301200	explaining upcoming huge changes, and it's a very long read, and this was just produced
5301200	5306960	a little bit this week, they actually did some polls, this is really long, so I might
5306960	5311280	have to read this while someone else is doing a story, but yeah, looks like they really
5311280	5316080	took this poll and kind of like took some of the feedback to heart, so what are they
5316080	5317200	talking about?
5317200	5322800	Tutorials for new players, quests revolving around the danger facing the world, public
5322800	5330800	company quests, improvements to the log, improvements of dialogue, windows, character jump feature,
5330800	5337520	interesting, guildlevs, so yeah, they want to do a whole bunch of new shit in the game,
5337520	5343200	we'll just leave it at that, there's a long letter available, lodestone.finalfantasyxiv,
5343200	5347360	the roman wayofsaying14.com, that's where you can find that.
5347360	5350680	Last couple tweets here, another one from Tiger Claw saying consumer group reporting
5350680	5356560	Activision to UK Fair Trade Office over black ops glitches, and this is a link to a story
5356560	5362200	on Gamasutra, it's a British consumer group, The Gamer's Voice, they're going to complain
5362200	5367200	to the UK Office of Fair Trading about the performance issues in the PS3 and PC versions
5367200	5372400	of Call of Duty Black Ops, I guess the publisher did not respond to an open letter from the
5372400	5377280	group one month ago, which talked about the freezing and online multiplayer login that
5377280	5380640	the game is not functioning as attended or advertised.
5380640	5386800	So I guess you could say it's kind of like the Better Business Bureau in a way, interesting.
5386800	5390480	So somebody's going to take him to task over that one, I don't know, these things usually
5390480	5394640	don't end up in much, usually like either a settlement or a letter or something, I don't
5394640	5397360	know, but it'll be interesting to see what happens overseas.
5397360	5402800	One last tweet from Alex Carson, Alex P. Carson on Twitter, do you remember last year when
5402800	5406360	I made a proposition of you mentioning me on the show in exchange for me raising your
5406360	5409680	Facebook fan count?
5409680	5411960	I gotta say no, but it was over a year ago.
5411960	5414400	But I did just name you on the show, there you go.
5414400	5419280	But I gotta be honest, and this is kind of in our philosophy on OLR in general, we don't
5419280	5425560	just want people, we don't just need numbers, we want people that listen to the show and
5425560	5426560	enjoy the show.
5426560	5430240	So yeah, of course, you know, we always ask at the end of every show, tell your friends
5430240	5434320	about the show, but you know, and again, I'm inferring a lot from this tweet, but of course
5434320	5439480	don't spam, don't spam, we don't need to sink to that level, and you know, I think it would
5439480	5442200	be awesome if your friends would join the Facebook page, but only if they really want
5442200	5443200	to hear the show.
5443200	5446920	If they're not into video games, you know, maybe this isn't the show for them.
5446920	5450960	Maybe they need to subscribe to a sex podcast, woohoo, so.
5450960	5453760	But we always appreciate any efforts, absolutely.
5453760	5457800	And I'll even read your Twitter name on there, there you go.
5457800	5458880	Alright!
5458880	5463400	Let's move on to some more gaming news, some phone calls coming up in just a little bit,
5463400	5464400	as well.
5464400	5465400	Mmhmm.
5465400	5472680	Um, so the court case against, um, Geohot has been delayed, and as we kind of alluded
5472680	5480200	to last week when we were talking about it, um, we brought up how it's being held right
5480200	5487460	now in San Francisco, but he's from New Jersey, and so, um, you know, there was a whole question
5487460	5489640	over the jurisdiction and stuff like that.
5489640	5492480	I remember talking about that last week, yeah.
5492480	5498400	Because according, you know, to, uh, the judge, it says if having a PayPal account were enough,
5498400	5503520	um, then there would be personal jurisdiction in this court over everybody, and that can't
5503520	5504520	be right.
5504520	5509920	And, um, so the case is pending further discussion over jurisdiction, a decision Sony is likely
5509920	5517680	to frown upon, um, and, you know, now, seeing as how the hack is, you know, completely available
5517680	5526600	online, and as I mentioned earlier, um, you know, installing it on your system is so stupid
5526600	5532600	easy now, especially if you want to install custom firmware that people have made, which
5532600	5538420	have gone a little bit beyond what Geohot, um, had wanted, and kind of, it could lead
5538420	5545440	to piracy, um, I mean, it's, it's literally just flashing your console in the recovery
5545440	5546440	mode.
5546440	5547440	That's it.
5547440	5555360	Um, yeah, I, I don't know, it's gonna be an interesting case.
5555360	5560040	Yeah, story's gonna come up every damn week until they settle.
5560040	5561040	Exactly.
5561040	5562040	Well, and then-
5562040	5563040	I don't think they'll settle either.
5563040	5567320	And then you have companies using it, the whole PS3 hacking thing, as an excuse.
5567320	5573280	According to Infinity Ward, um, I'm assuming this is what's left of Infinity Ward, um,
5573280	5579680	Modern Warfare 2 has been, or has been kind of made unplayable, thanks to people hacking
5579680	5583720	the game, and it says Infinity Ward cannot patch a fix.
5583720	5590920	Um, people are saying it's a total shambles, it's unplayable, um, according to Infinity
5590920	5597300	Ward's games rely on security of the encryption on the platforms they're played on, um, unless
5597300	5601880	the security exploit itself is resolved on the platform, updates to the game through
5601880	5604480	patches will not resolve the problem.
5604480	5608800	At this time, we do not have any ability to restore or adjust individual stats.
5608800	5618920	Uh, we're looking at every option to help us, um, help any user affected, and, um, here's
5618920	5620280	what's funny about this whole thing.
5620280	5624040	See, they put it out around the time when all these hacking stories, you know, with
5624040	5630360	the whole keys and stuff being released, um, were put out, but, if you look at the big
5630360	5634340	picture here, it's actually, this was happening before all that happened, and it's because
5634340	5641340	people have been hacking save files, and they've been doing that, um, so this is totally unrelated
5641340	5647280	to anything that has to do with those PS3 keys, and on top of that, um, they're doing
5647280	5650760	the same thing on the 360, they're hacking save files and stuff, and that stuff's been
5650760	5658860	kinda been patched, um, so, really comes down to, they just don't wanna fix it, and if you
5658860	5660400	think about it, why would they?
5660400	5662960	Modern Warfare 2, eh, whatever, so it goes to shit.
5662960	5663960	Buy Black Ops!
5663960	5666960	So, I don't know.
5666960	5674720	Interesting, I, uh, there's no way to just track down who's fucking up the game and just
5674720	5675720	ban them?
5675720	5680960	Um, they, maybe they could, but, you know, they could just create another account, I
5680960	5681960	guess.
5681960	5684120	They'd have to actually track down systems.
5684120	5685120	Interesting.
5685120	5688640	Sorry about that, you cut off there in the beginning.
5688640	5691000	So wouldn't that go back to the laziness factor?
5691000	5692000	I think so.
5692000	5693000	No.
5693000	5694000	Yep.
5694000	5696960	And here's the thing, though, is people aren't actually reading into this, they're kinda
5696960	5702920	saying, oh, well, thanks GeoHot for, you know, doing all this, now Modern Warfare 2 is unplayable.
5702920	5707880	If you're gonna believe everybody and what they say, and without doing actual research
5707880	5713840	into what's going on, then sure, go ahead and blame those hackers, but it is different.
5713840	5716720	It's a special kind of hacker out there.
5716720	5720980	It's the little kid that figures out, oh, hey, I can grief somebody this way, or I can
5720980	5725200	cheat in this game, and, you know, screwed up for everybody.
5725200	5730480	It's just like, you know, in the whole Grand Theft Auto, you know, hacking or modding community,
5730480	5734000	there's people that actually wanna make stuff that's kinda cool, and then there's people
5734000	5738200	that wanna make cars that freeze people, or guns that freeze people's games, because they're
5738200	5741420	douchebags, and that's what they do.
5741420	5745600	So no matter what you do, those douchebags will find a way to be a douche.
5745600	5747880	Play with your friends and nobody else.
5747880	5748880	Exactly.
5748880	5751320	That's sadly where some of this is going, honestly, online.
5751320	5753440	If you wanna play a legitimate game, you gotta play with your friends.
5753440	5755000	Take your ball and go home.
5755000	5756000	Ha!
5756000	5760800	All right, some news coming out of Square Enix this week, revolving in a tweet a little
5760800	5762320	bit ago, kinda references.
5762320	5766760	Final Fantasy XIII-2 was announced, and it's coming out for the 360 and the PlayStation
5766760	5767760	3.
5767760	5771100	It was during the little press event that Square Enix had this week.
5771100	5774040	There's a little trailer that goes with it as well.
5774040	5776060	We won't play that one like we did the other one, though.
5776060	5779760	But we will say that in the little logo, you can see that there's this whole little like
5779760	5784720	contrast character to lightning, so that there's kinda like, I don't know, an anti-lightning
5784720	5786000	or what it is.
5786000	5791600	Now they are saying that Final Fantasy XIII-2 is set to launch in Japan in 2011, but that's
5791600	5792920	probably just Japan.
5792920	5795760	They're not saying anything about the US just yet.
5795760	5797480	Oh no, they said next winter.
5797480	5798480	I'm sorry about that.
5798480	5799920	They said next winter was the release.
5799920	5804280	Does that mean next February or next December?
5804280	5805840	Because you could kinda take that a couple ways.
5805840	5807360	Hopefully it's a quick cycle.
5807360	5810760	I mean, I'm assuming this is just gonna be done in the same engine as the first game
5810760	5816800	was, but just, you know, new story, some new models and all that stuff.
5816800	5819600	Hopefully more dreshsphere, right?
5819600	5820600	Yay.
5820600	5823060	Okay, maybe not.
5823060	5826280	The name of Final Fantasy Agito XIII has been changed.
5826280	5830520	It's now Final Fantasy Type Zero, which would explain some of the stories in the past couple
5830520	5833080	weeks about these trademarks showing up.
5833080	5837560	Final Fantasy Type Zero is the game that is coming out instead.
5837560	5842400	It is gonna be on the PSP, of course, and they just said that this title just seems
5842400	5847520	to be more appropriate because this is a more action-oriented design of the game.
5847520	5848520	And there you go.
5848520	5849520	It's gonna be coming out to the PSP.
5849520	5854380	30 voiced characters in the game, multiplayer supposedly in it as well.
5854380	5857960	Nothing announced just yet for what's going on in North America, but it is coming out
5857960	5862000	to Japan this summer on two UMDs.
5862000	5863000	Not one, but two.
5863000	5865720	That must be a big game.
5865720	5868280	We'll see.
5868280	5873360	Well, how about going back to something that we touched on earlier?
5873360	5874360	Yay!
5874360	5875960	It's like a blast from the past.
5875960	5876960	Yes.
5876960	5878360	Duke Nukem Forever!
5878360	5879360	Yay.
5879360	5881000	Is there gonna be download content?
5881000	5882000	Is there?
5882000	5883000	Huh, huh, huh, huh?
5883000	5884000	Um, probably.
5884000	5888720	Well, they haven't announced anything about it, but they are saying that they are trying
5888720	5895280	to, and this is a quote, on making possible the UNpossible shipping Duke Nukem Forever.
5895280	5900800	Um, but they are saying that there could be some download content, that they are keeping
5900800	5903160	the future in mind.
5903160	5905920	So I'm sure there will be.
5905920	5907760	Build your own strip club DLC.
5907760	5908760	Yay!
5908760	5910400	I want voice macros to come back.
5910400	5911720	That'll be nice.
5911720	5913480	I wouldn't be surprised if they have DLC.
5913480	5917560	I mean, look at the awesome DLC they had for the original Duke Nukem 3D.
5917560	5921480	They have the fourth episode, the Atomic Edition, which is just awesome.
5921480	5923720	I love the supermarket level.
5923720	5927520	I love the level that was kind of Disneyland, but not, you know, the Pirates of the Caribbean
5927520	5929400	ride and stuff.
5929400	5930400	Awesome.
5930400	5933880	I just miss Duke Nukem Deathmatch.
5933880	5935800	That was awesome.
5935800	5938400	I hope this game is as awesome as the old Duke Nukem was.
5938400	5939400	I really do.
5939400	5940400	It looks pretty neat.
5940400	5941400	It does.
5941400	5942400	It does.
5942400	5947360	The trailer's sense of humor is any indication, but, you know, how often do games look cool
5947360	5948520	and they suck?
5948520	5950960	Just as a reference as the original.
5950960	5951960	Yes.
5951960	5958800	There are some developers out there developing for the iOS platform that are pissed off at
5958800	5967320	Apple because they just don't take piracy or theft seriously.
5967320	5971280	Theft in this case happens to be a game called The Blocks Cometh.
5971280	5975920	It's an iPhone game that's out there right now that's completely ripped off of a Flash
5975920	5976920	game.
5976920	5978080	It didn't just copy the game.
5978080	5981720	They took the name, they took the assets, the music, everything.
5981720	5983920	They ported it over.
5983920	5986600	Unfortunately, it's not by the creators.
5986600	5989120	It's by somebody else.
5989120	5993200	The creators of the actual game actually have a version for the iPhone that's in the works
5993200	5995520	right now, but they're pissed off.
5995520	6001920	They contacted Apple and their customer service or whomever has said their legal department
6001920	6009320	has contacted the people responsible for it and they've kind of given them the runaround,
6009320	6015160	but there's nothing really that they seem to be doing.
6015160	6019880	It's kind of a serious case if you think about it because it's not just, oh, this game is
6019880	6024320	sort of like Angry Birds or this game is sort of like something else.
6024320	6029120	This is literally, we took this game, stole everything from it, and threw it on there.
6029120	6036400	If I created Super Mario Brothers and popped it onto the iOS, Apple's app store and stuff
6036400	6037400	like that.
6037400	6038400	Well, could you?
6038400	6042080	I mean, if this game gets by, why hasn't someone done that yet?
6042080	6044080	Maybe they need to.
6044080	6052040	Super Mario Brothers or Great Giana Sisters, I don't know, take your pick.
6052040	6053040	That is pretty serious.
6053040	6056800	I thought when I first was reading the subject of the story, I was like, oh, maybe Apple's
6056800	6059120	not doing anything about the people that are copying the iOS, but you're talking about
6059120	6062640	they've actually approved and highlighted games that were just ripped off of shit on
6062640	6063640	the internet.
6063640	6064640	That's crazy.
6064640	6067800	It is actually promoted to the What's Hot section.
6067800	6070080	I have a feeling a lot of that runs on an algorithm, though.
6070080	6075680	I don't think that they necessarily specifically targeted that game to promote.
6075680	6076680	I think you're right.
6076680	6077920	It's probably getting a lot of downloads.
6077920	6082200	It's probably been getting a lot of downloads because of the coverage, honestly.
6082200	6084200	Is it a pay game, though?
6084200	6087240	Yes, it is a pay game.
6087240	6088360	Pay games aren't worth it.
6088360	6091800	By the way, AlphaCananagram, I don't know if you saw this, he's following up in chat
6091800	6094200	saying they have taken it down since then.
6094200	6097040	So it is no longer there.
6097040	6098880	But look at what it took for that to happen.
6098880	6101880	I think that's still fairly notable, you know what I mean?
6101880	6103280	Nobody saw that right away.
6103280	6107120	But of course, if I'm working at Apple and I'm testing these apps, am I gonna recognize
6107120	6108300	this game?
6108300	6109300	Probably not.
6109300	6114780	You know, they don't do the peer review thing like XNA does, where lots of people are prone
6114780	6117080	to recognize stuff that's ripped off.
6117080	6120660	But if it's just like a couple people at Apple, I mean, I would never recognize that this
6120660	6121660	game was ripped off.
6121660	6123640	I'd never played the original.
6123640	6131000	So in that way, I can kind of sympathize, but I guess they do need something else.
6131000	6135320	Maybe they need a quicker way to stake your claim if you do believe you've been ripped
6135320	6136320	off.
6136320	6137320	Maybe that's what they need.
6137320	6138320	I don't know.
6138320	6139320	Maybe.
6139320	6140320	We'll see.
6140320	6149560	Alright, so let's move on to another story that has to do with the Rock Band Network.
6149560	6152800	Woohoo, Rock Band!
6152800	6156840	Rock Band Network 2.0 is coming out in February.
6156840	6159380	February 15th is the date to be exact.
6159380	6162200	That's when the new track creation system will come out.
6162200	6167360	All songs currently being made for Rock Band Network, they must be done by February 14th
6167360	6169880	when 1.0 will be phased out.
6169880	6174300	And then everything after that for Rock Band Network 2 will require Rock Band 3.
6174300	6178420	I'm assuming this means because of, you know, the keyboards and all that other stuff.
6178420	6181180	So there you go.
6181180	6185760	By the way, Rock Band 3, sadly not doing too well on the sales charts, did it?
6185760	6188160	It didn't do too well after Christmas, did it?
6188160	6189160	That's too bad.
6189160	6190160	Still awesome.
6190160	6191160	Still awesome.
6191160	6192440	I agree.
6192440	6194520	Maybe forcing people to upgrade will do some good.
6194520	6198440	Maybe they should just cut slash the price of the game to 20 bucks and watch it fly off
6198440	6199440	shelves.
6199440	6201480	Hey, I have a friend that bought the Pro Guitar.
6201480	6202480	Oh yeah?
6202480	6203480	Yeah.
6203480	6204480	It's pretty heavy.
6204480	6206480	It's pretty cool too.
6206480	6214080	Alright, so with that, I guess we're going to get into the mailbag at mailbag.orangeloungeradoo.com
6214080	6217720	is the place where you send us emails every week.
6217720	6221520	So we're going to get into the mailbag.
6221520	6231720	Well, we actually, well, the mailbag kind of sucks because we've got nothing in it.
6231720	6233920	Read the spam!
6233920	6236080	Well, we don't have any spam either.
6236080	6241040	So I dedicate this to everyone who did not send an email.
6241040	6242040	I'll take the box!
6242040	6243040	The box!
6243040	6244040	You took the box!
6244040	6245040	Let's see what's in the box!
6245040	6246040	Nothing!
6246040	6247040	Absolutely nothing!
6247040	6248040	Stupid!
6248040	6249040	You're so stupid!
6249040	6250040	Stupid!
6250040	6251040	Stupid!
6251040	6252040	Stupid!
6252040	6253040	Stupid!
6253040	6254040	Stupid!
6254040	6255040	Stupid!
6255040	6256040	Stupid!
6256040	6257040	Stupid!
6257040	6258040	Stupid!
6258040	6259040	Stupid!
6259040	6269080	You're so stupid!
6269080	6270080	Nice.
6270080	6271080	Yeah.
6271080	6275520	You know, that's the movie that Dan and I got engaged over.
6275520	6276520	I know.
6276520	6277520	I remember that.
6277520	6278520	Yeah.
6278520	6281240	You want a drink from the fire hose.
6281240	6282240	You know what's funny?
6282240	6283240	Wheel of Fish.
6283240	6285880	I don't think I've ever seen that movie from start to finish.
6285880	6287280	No, the best thing.
6287280	6288280	Badgers!
6288280	6289280	Badgers!
6289280	6293560	We don't need no stinking badgers!
6293560	6296240	Weird Al needs to do another movie, don't you think?
6296240	6297560	He totally does.
6297560	6298560	Alright.
6298560	6301560	Uh, let's move on to the FUs of the week.
6301560	6303640	What an appropriate time to get into this segment.
6303640	6321040	Now I know we have some of these.
6321040	6327960	F you to certain situations that are beyond my control that involve finances and my house.
6327960	6328960	Logie?
6328960	6335560	Uh, F you to the people at A&W for not knowing how to fill up a half gallon of root beer.
6335560	6341360	It was actually, not to mention, it is impossible to transport this without it spilling everywhere
6341360	6345600	as it was, and um, it made it very difficult to drive.
6345600	6349680	I will never be buying a half gallon of root beer again, it is just too much root beer.
6349680	6351320	Half gallon of fucking root beer, Logie.
6351320	6352800	It's a half gallon of root beer.
6352800	6354120	It's not carbonated enough.
6354120	6355120	I don't understand why.
6355120	6357320	A&W from the tap is supposed to be the bomb too.
6357320	6359000	Yes, it's really sweet though.
6359000	6360000	It's really, really sweet.
6360000	6361000	It's like drinking syrup.
6361000	6364480	Their diet root beer is excellent though.
6364480	6367880	But yeah, I like their root beer.
6367880	6370880	Uh, my FU of the week, I have to be vague.
6370880	6373720	There's actually a lot of stuff going on but nothing I can talk about on my public show,
6373720	6375840	so F you to stuff.
6375840	6376840	That's all stuff.
6376840	6378840	There you go.
6378840	6382360	So, let's get back to some gaming news.
6382360	6385400	Then the Skype line in just a little bit after a couple more stories.
6385400	6386560	Logie, you need to cheer me up.
6386560	6388280	Do you have a story that might cheer me up?
6388280	6389280	Um, yes.
6389280	6394160	It's about the brand new Yogi Bear movie.
6394160	6396280	No, I'm not cheered up.
6396280	6399840	No, it's about Tiger Woods and a weird glitch.
6399840	6401280	This really isn't cheering me up.
6401280	6407380	It's about a weird glitch that is being reported, I don't even know if we should take this seriously,
6407380	6408960	by The Sun.
6408960	6413240	Yes, the tabloid magazine in the UK.
6413240	6419520	Apparently there was a glitch that this one woman has encountered, Brit and Joe, um, Elay
6419520	6426080	or whatever, apparently her avatar that she had set up on there, one day, when she popped
6426080	6428120	on the game, it was topless!
6428120	6430200	Oh, now you have my attention.
6430200	6431200	What?
6431200	6432200	What's this?
6432200	6433200	Nipples and everything.
6433200	6434200	What?
6434200	6442600	The, uh, the avatar is topless and of course EA was quick to say that, um, there is no
6442600	6448080	possible way that that could have been done without some sort of hack.
6448080	6453600	But as we've seen with, you know, games like Heavy Rain, I could believe that it could
6453600	6460360	be done, um, you know, granted she doesn't actually have like boob textures or whatever,
6460360	6465120	you know, the nipple bumps are there for like the clothing and stuff, but I don't think,
6465120	6469920	I think that just for some reason it's not drawing the clothing on.
6469920	6473840	But, uh, she's topless and playing golf.
6473840	6474840	Boobies!
6474840	6476520	You know what?
6476520	6480080	You get those women topless and playing golf, I bet you a lot more people-
6480080	6484960	I bet, I bet Tiger Woods would sell like twice as many copies as it does now.
6484960	6489120	Tiger Woods, the M-rated golf game.
6489120	6491440	There you go.
6491440	6494840	Well, it just took a story about boobies to cheer me up a little bit.
6494840	6495840	Tiger Boobs.
6495840	6496840	Tiger Boobs.
6496840	6498520	I like that.
6498520	6505360	All right, Xbox 360 is going to be seeing the return of some Wonderswan color shoot-em-ups.
6505360	6506720	That's right, that's awesome.
6506720	6510240	Judgment Silver Sword, I guess, is one of those games.
6510240	6513920	It was originally designed in a homebrew competition in 2001.
6513920	6515900	It was published in 2004.
6515900	6518700	It's now coming back on the Xbox 360.
6518700	6523880	Judgment Silver Sword and the remix Cardinal Sins, they are both going to be coming out,
6523880	6529120	I guess, their bonuses in a new 360 retail shmup, Eshkatos?
6529120	6530920	I don't know if I'm saying that right.
6530920	6533520	Of course, all these games are coming out in Japan.
6533520	6537040	There's two trailers for this game that are out there on the internet.
6537040	6539040	You can import it on March 24th.
6539040	6542640	I like this because I guess there's like one trailer here that shows like a split- because
6542640	6547800	you know how like vertical shmups on the 360 don't use much real estate on the screen at
6547800	6548800	all?
6548800	6551600	Like there's all this wasted horizontal space.
6551600	6556160	Well in this game- sorry it's a little loud, sorry guys.
6556160	6559160	It looks very pretty, I gotta say.
6559160	6562520	Like some of the effects they're doing and stuff, but then there's one part of the trailer
6562520	6568800	here where they're showing multiplayer in like three screens on the screen at once.
6568800	6571680	That's cool.
6571680	6573960	That's very cool.
6573960	6576880	And then they're dodging lots and lots of bullets.
6576880	6578880	They're dying.
6578880	6582680	WonderSwanColor shmups making a return on the 360, but only in Japan!
6582680	6585520	Which makes sense because WonderSwanColor was only out in Japan, never came out here.
6585520	6587920	It was such a good system too.
6587920	6589460	Our Skype line is now open!
6589460	6596000	You can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
6596000	6598780	You can go ahead and give us a call, we'll talk about whatever it is you want to talk
6598780	6599780	about.
6599780	6602280	In the meantime, should we see if there's any last minute stories because I know it
6602280	6606560	takes about a minute till the folks that are listening hear us begging for calls.
6606560	6611240	There's a rumor, well we talked a little bit about this, the 3G and stuff, and the OLD
6611240	6615000	screen on PSV2 already, I'm assuming, that was in Twitter Topics now that I think of
6615000	6616000	it.
6616000	6617000	Yep.
6617000	6618000	Okay, nevermind.
6618000	6620720	I had to pull it up and I was ready to go and everything.
6620720	6621720	Sorry.
6621720	6626280	I know I have more stuff to talk about here, I just have to pull it up.
6626280	6627280	Do do do.
6627280	6628280	Ummm.
6628280	6630280	What was I gonna say?
6630280	6631280	Words?
6631280	6632280	Words, yes.
6632280	6642280	Specifically, no I was gonna say that those people out there that are thinking about possibly
6642280	6646880	hacking your Playstation 3 using the readily available custom firmwares that are out there,
6646880	6653820	you may remember that they have ways of tracking you down, so make sure you get one of those
6653820	6662360	things that erases your game history or something like that.
6662360	6670080	A lot of the new programs have that built in so that you don't get caught, I guess.
6670080	6671680	LA Noire.
6671680	6676960	That was a game that also had a trailer leaked out for it.
6676960	6684080	Also gonna be coming out from Take-Two in May, this on May 17th, big game for Rockstar.
6684080	6687120	I mean it looks awesome.
6687120	6691200	So that'll be coming out in the middle of May there.
6691200	6696200	Also Plants vs. Zombies and Peggle coming to the Android Marketplace the second quarter
6696200	6697560	of this year.
6697560	6699560	Pretty neat.
6699560	6707080	Again, the phones are open, 1-877-GAM-OL-R or use the name on Skype is Orange Lounge
6707080	6708080	Radio.
6708080	6710080	It's gonna be another one of those nights.
6710080	6714200	Get your lazy butts up, pick up your phone, and give us a call.
6714200	6717160	If you have something to say, I mean, you're just gonna sit here on the line.
6717160	6722760	Talk about a video game and you better not be, um, what's your face?
6722760	6725960	Now see, I saw this story and I thought of you, Jamie.
6725960	6732600	Epic Mickey, you're talking about 10 different Easter eggs that are in this game from different
6732600	6734200	Disney history and stuff like that.
6734200	6742280	For example, in the game, actually in Mickey Junk Mountain, they actually have a basketball
6742280	6747840	court in that part of the game as well.
6747840	6748840	That's cool.
6748840	6752200	They kind of allude to the basketball court that's in Matterhorn.
6752200	6754640	Let's go to the phones, we do have a call on the line.
6754640	6756040	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6756040	6757040	Who's this?
6757040	6758040	Hi, can you hear me?
6758040	6759040	Uh, we sure can.
6759040	6760040	Who is this?
6760040	6761520	Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
6761520	6763920	DDR Dollar Bill, what is on your mind?
6763920	6764920	Hey, not much.
6764920	6770080	Um, I took your advice a couple weeks ago and then I actually picked up a, well, I guess
6770080	6774080	you can call it an indie game, but one that's been getting a whole bunch of hype from everybody.
6774080	6775080	What's that?
6775080	6776080	Minecraft.
6776080	6777080	Ah, okay.
6777080	6781040	Now, for those that didn't hear, you called in a couple weeks ago and I believe it was
6781040	6784440	something about, I am just frustrated with games today.
6784440	6789280	It's same shit, different year, you know, I feel like there's no games for me to play
6789280	6790800	and I said, well, try indie.
6790800	6794120	So you went for a popular indie title, but an indie one nonetheless.
6794120	6795120	Minecraft.
6795120	6797120	What do you think of Minecraft?
6797120	6798120	Hello?
6798120	6801100	Did we lose him?
6801100	6802100	Can you still hear us?
6802100	6803100	God damn it.
6803100	6804100	I think we lost.
6804100	6805100	Hi, can you hear me?
6805100	6806100	Yes, we can now.
6806100	6807100	Hi.
6807100	6808100	What did you think of-
6808100	6809100	Oh, pfft.
6809100	6810100	Hi.
6810100	6811100	Stupid microphone.
6811100	6812100	Did you mute yourself?
6812100	6813100	Hi, can you hear me?
6813100	6814100	What did you think of Minecraft?
6814100	6818600	Um, for a beta, I'm very impressed.
6818600	6819600	Yeah?
6819600	6826000	Yeah, it's weird in that it's the total freedom to do anything.
6826000	6831800	It's almost like, I feel like I have nothing to do, but I'm just enjoying just doing nothing.
6831800	6834200	Okay, I have never played Minecraft.
6834200	6836960	I read a lot about it on the interwebs, but I've not played it.
6836960	6839340	So can you like, tell me what Minecraft is?
6839340	6842680	What do you do in Minecraft?
6842680	6851640	The best way I can say this is, you pretty much make stuff to sort of build, well the
6851640	6856460	idea is that you pretty much have to build your shelter and your tools and everything
6856460	6861480	out of different parts you find here and there, and during the day, and you have to make good
6861480	6868400	shelter because at night, you get invaded by zombies and skeletons and spiders, so you
6868400	6873040	want to be safe at night, and then you do the same thing every day, like daytime you
6873040	6879920	build stuff and raise trees and make flowers and kill animals for food, and at night you
6879920	6882080	pretty much either hide or you defend yourself.
6882080	6885840	Okay, so there is like kind of an actual game to it, because I was always under the impression
6885840	6890720	that there really wasn't a lot to it outside of like creation and building, so that's kind
6890720	6891720	of cool.
6891720	6895480	Okay, so you're trying to prevent, I guess, zombies from eating your face.
6895480	6898840	I like stuff, so that's kind of cool.
6898840	6904100	So did this help kind of break your video game blahs, or are you still looking for that
6904100	6908400	game that just makes you love video games again?
6908400	6913960	It sort of helped kill the blahs because I also realized that I'm pretty much a PC gamer
6913960	6917600	for life now.
6917600	6922760	I've pretty much shied away from PS3 and Xbox, and I like playing on a PC a lot better.
6922760	6923760	Why?
6923760	6925720	I'll give you an example.
6925720	6931800	I tried out the demo the other day for Mass Effect 2 just for shits and giggles.
6931800	6937880	It ran so much better on my computer than on the Xbox or PS3.
6937880	6942680	So it's more a matter of you feel like the technology that the games need today, maybe
6942680	6945160	the console cycle's gone on too long.
6945160	6949120	You know, let's face it, the 360's been out now, it's going on its fifth year, right?
6949120	6951960	So maybe it's time for some new consoles?
6951960	6959360	Either that or some heavy updates and whatnot, because my computer's not that old either,
6959360	6964240	but it was running circles around the console, so I was like, what the hell?
6964240	6971280	Well a lot of it has to do with your video card as well.
6971280	6972280	That's a big part of it too.
6972280	6974320	So you have a newer video card in your system?
6974320	6980060	Yeah, I mean I got one just last year, it's still a newer one.
6980060	6986360	My process is old, but it's one of those things where logically it doesn't make sense, but
6986360	6987360	it just works.
6987360	6990600	I'm going to a chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.
6990600	6993800	Bochi Kawa says, Minecraft is like Legos, the RPG.
6993800	6997800	You know there is actually a really fun, just a Lego builder game that is on the official
6997800	6998800	Lego website.
6998800	7002240	It's not really a game, it's like a tool where you just have a virtual box of Legos and you
7002240	7005700	can put together whatever, and then of course it's to sell more Legos.
7005700	7009740	You click a button and they will send you the bricks you need to make your thing.
7009740	7010740	You just built.
7010740	7011740	Which I think is kind of amazing.
7011740	7012740	Oh wow.
7012740	7014360	I know right?
7014360	7019720	Some other comments in chat, Bonds006 says, Same here, I will always be a PC gamer.
7019720	7023040	And Alex P. Carson says, PC greater than fucking anything.
7023040	7025400	So you have some people supporting you on your side.
7025400	7026400	Absolutely.
7026400	7027400	Awesome.
7027400	7028400	Alright.
7028400	7031600	Well, DDR Dollar Bill, we're going to let you go to get some more calls, but any quick
7031600	7033600	final thoughts for our listeners?
7033600	7035280	Uh, yeah.
7035280	7036280	Support PC gaming.
7036280	7037600	Alright, we'll try.
7037600	7041320	And hey, Steam is going to save PC gaming, if it hasn't already.
7041320	7042320	Hey, Steam rocks.
7042320	7043880	Alright, and the indie stuff of course.
7043880	7045440	Alright, have a good one buddy.
7045440	7046440	You too, thanks guys.
7046440	7051480	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype if you want to give us a call.
7051480	7053800	Any other last minute stories for us?
7053800	7054800	I have nothing.
7054800	7055800	Aww.
7055800	7056800	Um, sure.
7056800	7058440	You'll just have to make something up.
7058440	7061360	Dark Soccer, wait, no, I want Dark Soccer to make something up.
7061360	7063040	Make up a video game news story.
7063040	7066040	Something that actually didn't happen.
7066040	7071720	Uh, uh, uh, uh.
7071720	7075280	I'm putting her on the spot people, it's live radio.
7075280	7076280	Chirp.
7076280	7077280	Chirp.
7077280	7080520	Oh, a new Angry Birds game is coming out?
7080520	7085560	Yeah, a new Angry Birds versus Dark Soccer.
7085560	7088680	Angry Birds versus Angry Co-host.
7088680	7092600	I was going to say Angry Birds versus Zombies.
7092600	7098960	Of course, because everything indie these days is something something versus zombies,
7098960	7099960	right?
7099960	7100960	Indeed.
7100960	7102200	Let's go to another call.
7102200	7103200	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
7103200	7104200	Who's this?
7104200	7105200	Hey, this is X-Link.
7105200	7106200	Hey buddy, how you doing?
7106200	7107200	Hey, doing good.
7107200	7110880	I got to play with the PS3 move for my first time.
7110880	7113080	Ah, what'd you think of the PS3 move?
7113080	7115560	I, I, depending on the game, I really like it.
7115560	7123720	Um, though I did like the, um, bowling, um, and, um, the, um, the, the sports one they
7123720	7125680	had out, it was, it was pretty fun.
7125680	7127560	It was, it was a lot of fun.
7127560	7132960	It had a lot of similarities to that of Wii, but it, the, the graphics and the way they
7132960	7134600	did it was a lot better.
7134600	7138840	The, um, output and the way it was controlled was, I think, for personally, for me, it was
7138840	7139840	a lot smoother.
7139840	7140840	So.
7140840	7144920	Do you, I mean, maybe this is a really hard question to ask, but it's something I've given
7144920	7147280	a lot of thought to myself is that, okay.
7147280	7151200	And I've said this on the show before, you know, connect and move they're out there now.
7151200	7155800	And most of the games that have come out originally are for the most part with a few exceptions,
7155800	7158920	copies of Wii games, you know, and with nicer graphics.
7158920	7161240	Where do you think the move goes next?
7161240	7164760	Can you see the move integrated into Sony's core franchises?
7164760	7165760	The world.
7165760	7167640	It's going to become the world like that of.hack.
7167640	7173920	We're going to have visors and everything, and it's going to become one big MMO.
7173920	7175840	It already is in their core franchises.
7175840	7178600	A lot of it seems, a lot of it really feels like an afterthought though.
7178600	7179760	Like LittleBigPlanet 2.
7179760	7182400	Yeah, the move supports there in a bonus level.
7182400	7183680	No, I understand that.
7183680	7184680	That's just retarded.
7184680	7187160	That's just basically the prehistoric thing that's in there.
7187160	7194400	Um, no, I'm saying it's in their core franchises as in SOCOM 4 and Killzone 3.
7194400	7195680	Those are core franchises.
7195680	7196680	Okay.
7196680	7199360	Granted, I don't pay attention to a lot of the first person shooters.
7199360	7200360	That's why.
7200360	7203000	And I remember seeing that at the GDC even, but.
7203000	7209200	Granted, their gun that they have, their little shell, is retarded looking.
7209200	7210200	Just saying.
7210200	7212040	No, I agree with you.
7212040	7213640	I agree with you on that.
7213640	7218280	I'm hoping that people will step up to the planet on those things and make stuff better,
7218280	7221320	like actual better looking guns and stuff like that.
7221320	7226520	Um, you know, like, for example, like Time Crisis with Namco, I like the guns they use.
7226520	7229760	It makes you feel like you're playing the arcade with their actual guns, so the guns
7229760	7234560	are quite different from that of the arcade because of the feedback and whatnot, but.
7234560	7238840	And there's no pedal button, but still, I think they will do good.
7238840	7241320	It's moving in the right direction, I believe.
7241320	7242320	What was the-
7242320	7246200	It's sad, though, because it's really killing off stuff like arcades and stuff that I grew
7246200	7247480	up loving as a kid.
7247480	7249720	It's just, you know, it's hard to compete.
7249720	7251840	Well, I don't think the move killed that.
7251840	7257560	I think Xbox Live and just the internet in general killed that.
7257560	7258560	MMOs.
7258560	7262520	Yeah, you know, MMOs for real used to be going to the arcade, you know.
7262520	7263520	I don't know.
7263520	7264520	It's depressing.
7264520	7270360	Instead of booting up your computer or your Xbox and playing the games, yeah, it really
7270360	7271360	was.
7271360	7274280	And it was a lot of fun playing your quarters and stuff on top of the, you know, on top
7274280	7278360	of, you know, in certain areas saying, hey, look, I want to be next, you know, or have
7278360	7280720	to be, you know, waiting in line, you know.
7280720	7283840	I guess maybe save that 20 minute wait from playing that one game that you really want
7283840	7284840	to play.
7284840	7288080	But at the same time, too, you know, it's kind of sad, you know.
7288080	7292720	That, you know, that feeling you got being around a big crowd and they're cheering you
7292720	7293720	on and stuff.
7293720	7297200	It's not really the same.
7297200	7303280	Yeah, I think it would be cool if they would make, like, an MMO that kind of, you know,
7303280	7305240	if you can't beat them, join them.
7305240	7307280	Make an MMO about, like, going to arcades.
7307280	7308280	That's what game room should have been.
7308280	7313040	Like, an MMO where you're going to the arcade and playing these old school games and the
7313040	7316560	better you get at games, the better you can skill up your character to maybe help you
7316560	7317720	get, like, cheap.
7317720	7319800	I don't want to say cheap but get better in other games.
7319800	7320800	I don't know.
7320800	7321800	There's an idea there.
7321800	7322800	No.
7322800	7323800	I agree on that.
7323800	7324800	That'd be cool.
7324800	7325800	What's the best thing you played on Move?
7325800	7326800	I'll kind of end it with that question.
7326800	7330480	Well, unfortunately, I only played two different games, so probably the bowling because I did
7330480	7334840	really well against my friends on that one, so the Bronx took bowling.
7334840	7335840	Okay.
7335840	7341240	Also, really quickly, Gearbox, I think, is going to do really great with the Duke Nukem
7341240	7345360	because they did a really great job with Borderlands and their DLC.
7345360	7351200	So if they keep it close to making somewhat of the original feel, from what I've seen
7351200	7353800	from the trailers and stuff, I think they're going to do a really good job.
7353800	7357240	It's going to be really, really interesting to see what they do with it.
7357240	7360520	And I know they really are with their fans and what the fans want.
7360520	7364220	So I wouldn't be surprised if they make some kind of mod so you can build your own strip
7364220	7368320	club or build your own miniature bat.
7368320	7372800	I would see a lot of that probably coming out near and down the road also because a
7372800	7377640	lot of feedback has been really positive on it, and they really want what the people want.
7377640	7381560	So that's been a really good, positive thing too.
7381560	7387960	One day we'll have our arcades again, but we'll take that next great invention to bring
7387960	7389840	people back.
7389840	7391720	More beer in arcades, that's what it really needs.
7391720	7395400	Because you look at the arcades that are popular, Dave & Buster's, the Retro arcades, they all
7395400	7396400	serve beer.
7396400	7400720	Well, there's one by where I used to live, believe it or not, that did the same thing
7400720	7402280	too, and it was very popular.
7402280	7403280	Less kids, more beer.
7403280	7407400	Again, it was beer at EDR, so I mean, pretty much go hand in hand, so yeah.
7407400	7408400	All right.
7408400	7411400	All right, well buddy, we're going to let you go to try and fit in a couple more calls,
7411400	7412400	but have a good one.
7412400	7413400	Yeah, you too.
7413400	7414400	No problem.
7414400	7415400	All right, thanks.
7415400	7416400	Bye.
7416400	7417400	All right, so let's go to another call.
7417400	7418400	Hi.
7418400	7419400	You're on Orange Mountain Radio.
7419400	7420400	Who's this?
7420400	7421400	Hey, it's Zappi.
7421400	7422400	Hey, Zappi.
7422400	7423400	How you doing?
7423400	7424400	Oh, pretty good.
7424400	7425400	All right.
7425400	7426400	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
7426400	7431400	Well, I've been playing one of the big releases of the week, well, only big releases of the
7431400	7436000	week, Little Big Planet 2, and I can't say more than, I mean, like, it's awesome.
7436000	7439400	All right, so let me ask you some of the same stuff I asked Loki in the beginning of the
7439400	7441040	show, because I haven't played the game yet.
7441040	7444640	What did you notice right away, or maybe not right away, but what did you notice were some
7444640	7447920	differences from Little Big Planet 1 when you played the game?
7447920	7454480	I learned that there's, like, a lot more variety when I'm playing it, like, Little Big Planet
7454480	7458640	1 was a good, solid platform, but with the second one, they really, like, tried to make
7458640	7464600	it different, having, like, different, like, gimmicks in it, like, sort of, like, how they
7464600	7471440	had notions for Mario World, where they, like, shook up the gameplay a little bit, and, like,
7471440	7476800	for example, like, there's some levels that are just like, oh my god, I'm playing a shmup,
7476800	7483200	or there's other ones where you're controlling a giant rabbit, like, they really, like, made
7483200	7487120	it interesting and, like, they're like a full sequel instead of, like, just something, like,
7487120	7488520	shoveled on.
7488520	7490920	So what's some of the cool stuff you've seen in the user-created levels?
7490920	7493680	I don't know if you've had a chance to dip in there, but have you seen any really cool
7493680	7496760	user-created stuff yet?
7496760	7501040	One of the cool things I saw was they made an entire tower defense game out of the Little
7501040	7502040	Big Planet engine.
7502040	7503040	Oh, wow, nice.
7503040	7509520	Yeah, I was kind of surprised that you do that, but they designed this in mind that
7509520	7515360	you can basically take whatever game ideas you want and make it, which is really exciting.
7515360	7519400	Speaking of taking whatever ideas you want and making it, I have to, and I apologize
7519400	7522600	from deviating from your call a little bit, but, you know, in the last call, we were talking
7522600	7526040	about ways to save arcades, and, of course, our chat room's going off on that.
7526040	7533320	sj100matt says, tits could save arcades, and xlink says, now, that could be a good idea,
7533320	7535480	so maybe you need to mix strip clubs with arcades.
7535480	7541560	When in doubt, show some tits, right, DarkSakura?
7541560	7542560	How about some cock?
7542560	7544400	All right, well, that could work, too.
7544400	7547480	There could be something for everybody, absolutely, I agree.
7547480	7548480	Boobs and nuts.
7548480	7549480	Equal opportunity.
7549480	7550480	Boobs and nuts.
7550480	7552480	Boobs and nuts.
7552480	7557400	You know, there was an old-ass game on the NES, I really apologize, by the way, there
7557400	7561880	was an old-school game on the NES years and years ago, it was only out in Japan, not out
7561880	7566720	here, it was called Nuts and Milk.
7566720	7571880	I shit you not, look it up, it's on Wikipedia, Nuts and Milk, and that could be the name
7571880	7573880	of the arcade.
7573880	7574880	What's that?
7574880	7576840	How does that get past censors?
7576840	7582320	Because it's Japan, it's not the same, they don't have the same slang, it's different,
7582320	7583320	so all right.
7583320	7588520	Oh yeah, LittleBigPlanet 2, so have you played the Nuts and Milk remake in LittleBigPlanet
7588520	7589520	2 yet?
7589520	7593800	I'm sure it's coming along any day now, but unfortunately no.
7593800	7595760	Oh, okay, that's too bad.
7595760	7600400	All right, so, anything else you've been playing lately, just LittleBigPlanet 2 taking up your
7600400	7601400	time, or any other games?
7601400	7606080	I've also been playing some Dead Space, the first one, looking forward to the new one
7606080	7610720	that's coming out this week, and I can't believe you missed this game in 2008 because it's
7610720	7611720	really fun.
7611720	7617440	Because it went off my radar for so long, I'm going okay to make a second one, there
7617440	7624240	must be something to it, and I can't believe it, it's really going back to the survival
7624240	7628120	horror roots, where you're actually being freaked out, like you're thinking that something
7628120	7631600	is around that next corner, and there might be.
7631600	7636360	It kind of sucks when games like, you find out about them like three years after they
7636360	7641140	were out, and then like, by the time you're like, this game was fucking rad, you found
7641140	7644800	out that the development studio got closed, and everybody got laid off, like I bet you
7644800	7647720	anything that's gonna happen to blur.
7647720	7652040	When the game's down to 20 bucks, if it's not already, it'll start selling more copies,
7652040	7657360	and then people are like, wow, they should really make a sequel to this, oh shit, they
7657360	7658360	should.
7658360	7662600	Yeah, it's a shame that happened, like blur was pretty fun.
7662600	7666400	Alright, well anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight before we let you
7666400	7667400	go?
7667400	7668800	I don't know, that's it.
7668800	7672280	Alright, well have fun with LittleBigPlanet 2, hopefully I'll be playing it pretty soon
7672280	7675560	as well, just you know, gotta wait to save up the money.
7675560	7676560	Okay.
7676560	7678560	Alright, later buddy.
7678560	7683720	877-Game-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a
7683720	7684720	call.
7684720	7687960	If you want to give us a call, call came in from Canada.
7687960	7689280	Maybe he had said that before, he was kidding.
7689280	7693160	My friend just got back from Toronto, actually, he's coming back in tonight, you know, Grandpa
7693160	7698440	Warcraft, went to Toronto, went to Toronto and just coming back tonight.
7698440	7699440	Cool.
7699440	7702560	Yeah, I want to go to Toronto, I've never been.
7702560	7704400	Here it's really fun, Vancouver's awesome though.
7704400	7705400	I want to go to Vancouver.
7705400	7708440	Like how can Toronto be better than Vancouver, I'm sure there's a lot of people living in
7708440	7713520	Toronto that are mad at me for saying that, but seriously, Vancouver is awesome, awesome.
7713520	7715600	Let's go to the phones, there's more calls coming in.
7715600	7718720	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
7718720	7719720	This is Chortles.
7719720	7720720	Chortles!
7720720	7721720	Hi buddy, how are you?
7721720	7722720	Hey.
7722720	7724720	Hey, what's on your mind tonight?
7724720	7725720	Chortles?
7725720	7732160	Um, honestly, I was just considering, is it just me or is it PlayStation, like, okay let's
7732160	7740160	put it this way, you know how Activision, is it true that you on PlayStation Network,
7740160	7745920	these publishers have to put out the servers themselves for the multiplayer?
7745920	7754640	Because I've been considering that in the wake of, like, okay I'm not sure if I'm overhearing
7754640	7759600	this, but basically, have you heard the reports about PlayStation Network getting hacked recently?
7759600	7761600	Loki, is that something familiar to you?
7761600	7763680	The PlayStation Network's been getting hacked recently?
7763680	7766760	I don't follow that stuff as well, so you don't really.
7766760	7770920	I'm sure somebody's trying to hack it.
7770920	7774520	Which probably includes PlayStation Network and all this stuff with the Modern Warfare
7774520	7775520	and so on.
7775520	7778440	Yeah, I'm sure you've heard that.
7778440	7781600	I just want to jump quickly back to your question about the whole central servers and who's
7781600	7782960	really running them.
7782960	7786880	I think to some extent the publishers are running, I mean, I don't know the ins and
7786880	7790880	outs of games, but like for example, EA, we just had a story on them a couple weeks ago
7790880	7794280	that they were shutting down the servers for a bunch of old sports titles.
7794280	7799280	So I think they do run servers, I think what Microsoft and PlayStation, what they're running
7799280	7802560	is kind of like the matchmaking and distribution services.
7802560	7806040	When you download upgrades and so forth, it's coming from their servers because they're
7806040	7807880	getting a cut of the profits.
7807880	7811560	When you're connecting to find opponents, it's probably through them.
7811560	7814760	But then when you're actually playing the game, it's probably through the publishers.
7814760	7820140	I also would cite things like DC Universe, which is sort of a gray area because that's
7820140	7823240	Sony Online Entertainment, so maybe less.
7823240	7825640	But what about things like Final Fantasy XI?
7825640	7832520	I mean that game, people forget it's on the 360, but it is, and it is such a unique game
7832520	7834200	because it has two front ends.
7834200	7838400	It has Xbox Live, which you don't even need gold, but then you use it to basically connect
7838400	7843800	to Play Online, which is really the central, I mean, Final Fantasy XI literally breaks
7843800	7847040	every single rule you know about Xbox Online.
7847040	7850760	And nobody's playing it on the Xbox, which is interesting.
7850760	7856400	I guess most people aren't looking to it for Final Fantasy XI, but the reason I was wondering
7856400	7862000	that is because on the one hand, you know, you have the whole idea about, oh, you get
7862000	7863000	–
7863000	7864000	Yeah?
7864000	7865000	Go ahead.
7865000	7866000	Yeah.
7866000	7867000	I'm sorry.
7867000	7871160	I just realized that I'm actually hearing what we just said previously for like a few
7871160	7872880	seconds later as background echo.
7872880	7876560	Good old school first rule of calling into radio, turn down your radio because it throws
7876560	7877560	everybody off.
7877560	7878560	It's all right.
7878560	7879560	Yeah.
7879560	7880560	Fair enough, man.
7880560	7881560	Yeah.
7881560	7890440	I was just considering that in the fact that Activision has a deal with Microsoft to have
7890440	7893760	released the DLC first on 360.
7893760	7898080	Isn't that likely for the next two Call of Duty's at least as well?
7898080	7902360	I'm not sure of the specifics of the agreement, but it's certainly not uncommon that one console
7902360	7905440	gets download content that the other consoles don't get.
7905440	7906440	That's –
7906440	7907440	At least earlier.
7907440	7908920	I think buying exclusives for forever.
7908920	7912600	You wanna cite another example, look at what's going on with the PlayStation 3 and Portal
7912600	7914840	2, which we talked about in the rapid fire news earlier in this whole like –
7914840	7915840	Oh, I heard about that.
7915840	7916840	Yeah, the cloud –
7916840	7918720	Is Portal 2 coming to 360 by the way?
7918720	7919720	It is.
7919720	7920720	Okay.
7920720	7924320	But Sony is really trying to do everything they can to make theirs, and this is the quote
7924320	7928840	from what they said at E3, the definitive version of Portal 2.
7928840	7929840	Uh-huh.
7929840	7930840	Ooh.
7930840	7934880	Well, which is really funny considering that that means free access to the other two versions.
7934880	7940560	Yeah, I mean to the home computer versions, which come to think of it, that's actually
7940560	7942520	a business model I really like.
7942520	7952240	You pay for the game once, and then you have the game period in whichever way it's playable
7952240	7953600	other than 360.
7953600	7957640	I love that model too, and think about the caller that called in – I don't know if
7957640	7961560	you heard the guy earlier that called in saying that he's all about PC gaming now because
7961560	7965320	consoles just aren't doing it for him, and the games run better on his PC.
7965320	7967880	I think he'd be frothing at the mouth about an idea like that.
7967880	7972400	Imagine buying Mass Effect 2 on the PlayStation and you get it on all consoles.
7972400	7975680	Yeah, like that would be my sort of thing.
7975680	7979120	I mean, I could not get enough of that.
7979120	7988080	I mean, it's funny that he revived his love of PC games because – okay, I'll just
7988080	7990760	let you know what I've been doing over the winter.
7990760	7998600	Basically, I think one of the only games that I bought for a console in 2010 was Assassin's
7998600	7999600	Creed Brotherhood.
7999600	8002560	Mind you, that was a launch game.
8002560	8004480	It was immensely satisfying for a while.
8004480	8010960	I don't regret that purchase, but then after a while it petered out, especially when it
8010960	8015880	came to trying to get good connectivity for the multiplayer, and while there were some
8015880	8020800	severe issues with lag and multiplayer –
8020800	8021800	The baby escaped.
8021800	8027640	There's a baby in the background that appears to have escaped.
8027640	8028640	You know what?
8028640	8035920	Let me put it this – I'm not going to pretend how she would know the word lag.
8035920	8039520	I'm just going to leave it at that.
8039520	8041120	Dark Soccer, can you get CPS on the line?
8041120	8042120	No, I'm kidding.
8042120	8043120	I'm kidding.
8043120	8044120	All right.
8044120	8051200	I'm sorry if this is boring everywhere when it's listening in, but basically I found
8051200	8058160	that over the holidays I was doing my Christmas shopping, and unlike last year, I found that
8058160	8061640	there wasn't much that I was looking for in the way of Steam.
8061640	8066000	I mean, yes, I know about the legendary Steam holiday and summer sales.
8066000	8071160	I have partaken of them in past years, but this time I found that even though I was sitting
8071160	8076840	on a nice chunk of change, I mainly just wanted to upgrade my hardware.
8076840	8083440	For example – okay, main thing that I changed is my video card.
8083440	8091840	Originally I was using onboard video, don't ask, but as a result, basically this time
8091840	8102280	around I decided to upgrade to a Radeon HD 5770 made by MSI, one gigabyte.
8102280	8110260	I think a lot of the draw for me was the cooling, like two fans, three heat pipes, a heat sink.
8110260	8115400	It was pretty cool stuff, and so far it seems to run all my games decently.
8115400	8120520	You know, I think with the PC it's really about the hardware, making the right choices
8120520	8123240	with that, and if you invest with that, you're going to get a huge payback.
8123240	8127600	I mean, I know I upgraded my video card last year so I could run Warcraft better, which
8127600	8129520	is the only PC game I need to be playing.
8129520	8130520	No, I'm kidding.
8130520	8131520	There's lots of them.
8131520	8132520	Oh, no, no.
8132520	8136200	Hey, I've played World of – like, I've played World of Warcraft for a long time.
8136200	8140880	I jumped – like, I took the weak trial for Cataclysm, but I'm not paying for that right
8140880	8147360	now, although I will give this advice to anyone who plays World of Warcraft.
8147360	8151680	Even if you take a break in the form of, like, canceling your subscription or not playing
8151680	8154120	a while, get the Battle.net authenticator.
8154120	8159240	Like, if you don't already have it and you use a smartphone, just get the mobile authenticator.
8159240	8162240	Because you don't want people using your account while you're not there.
8162240	8167360	Yeah, I've actually had that happen to me in – like, in the summer of 2010.
8167360	8173480	Like, two weeks after – two weeks after my subscription ran out, boom, my account
8173480	8175080	was hacked.
8175080	8178840	A lot of stuff – a lot of stuff got stolen.
8178840	8186160	My – like, my all-time highest level item got jacked, and by the time I found – by
8186160	8193280	the time I found out, got my account unhacked, and got back into World of Warcraft, it was
8193280	8195560	too late for Blizzard to recover my stuff.
8195560	8199600	Yeah, and it's a story I have heard way, way, way too many times.
8199600	8203120	But, Chortles, I've got to wrap up and let you go, because if I keep letting you talking,
8203120	8204680	pretty soon they're going to give you our time slot.
8204680	8206920	So I've got to wrap up and let you go.
8206920	8207920	Find the baby!
8207920	8211520	Well, if I set out, I'll probably have – I'll probably be more focused next time,
8211520	8212520	I suppose.
8212520	8214160	That baby has walked out the front door by now.
8214160	8215160	Go get him.
8215160	8216160	All right.
8216160	8217160	Yeah, all right.
8217160	8218160	All right.
8218160	8219160	Bye.
8219160	8221280	Thank you, Chortles, for that call.
8221280	8223560	He was just really happy to be here.
8223560	8224640	He just – he sounded happy.
8224640	8225640	I like enthusiasm.
8225640	8226640	Brains!
8226640	8227640	Brains!
8227640	8228640	Give him the call.
8228640	8229640	He was just enthusiastic.
8229640	8230640	Brains.
8230640	8231640	You're saying it was a zombie baby in the background?
8231640	8232640	Yes.
8232640	8233640	I'm – all right.
8233640	8234640	Be nice.
8234640	8235640	All right.
8235640	8236640	Thank you so much for the Skype line tonight.
8236640	8237640	Thank you guys so much for calling us.
8237640	8239840	If you didn't get through tonight, please consider sending us an email.

8244360	8246280	We would really appreciate it.
8246280	8247940	All right.
8247940	8249800	Let's wrap up the show.
8249800	8250800	We're done.
8250800	8251800	Is there any other last-minute stories we've got to get out?
8251800	8252800	Ribbons and bows, Rob.
8252800	8253800	Ribbons and bows.
8253800	8254920	Spanking on the butt.
8254920	8255920	It's done.
8255920	8256920	Slack.
8256920	8257920	I have nothing.
8257920	8258920	All right.
8258920	8261560	Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought, and we'll start with Loki
8261560	8262560	tonight.
8262560	8263840	Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
8263840	8270240	My sound card decides when it decides to work and not – and I don't like that.
8270240	8274720	My final thought is I took Friday off, so yay for four-day work week next week.
8274720	8275720	Woo!
8275720	8277680	Dark Soccer, you have a final thought?
8277680	8278680	Reject false icons.
8278680	8279680	Ooh.
8279680	8280680	You're going old school.
8280680	8281680	I am.
8281680	8284280	I didn't expect you to whip that out until episode 400.
8284280	8287240	Let me whip this out.
8287240	8288240	She's just getting warmed up.
8288240	8289240	Yeah.
8289240	8290240	It's been a very long time since I've heard that one.
8290240	8291760	I'm warming up my bitch-slapping hand.
8291760	8292760	All right.

8306720	8307720	Stop.
8307720	8309720	Like candy.
8309720	8312840	Dark Soccer is like, I got a lollipop.
8312840	8314240	Tell friends – I'm trying to do a plug.
8314240	8316400	This is a very important plug I'm trying to do here, Dark Soccer.
8316400	8317400	Stop derailing me with your toilet humor.
8317400	8318680	Are you plugging it already?
8318680	8319960	Stop it.

8347280	8348280	Exactly.
8348280	8349280	I think.
8349280	8350280	We're going to do it for another week.
8350280	8353280	We will be back next week to do it all again.
8353280	8354280	I'm so excited.
8354280	8355280	I just can't hide it.
