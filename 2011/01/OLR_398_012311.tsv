13859	25867	Tonight, January 23, 2011, the 3DS US launch gets some details, Final Fantasy games get sequels and new names, and after over a decade, we finally have a release date for Duke Nukem Forever.
31411	38817	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
38937	45162	We are live with our 398th episode on this January the 23rd of 2011.
46003	48105	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you every week.
48585	52429	With me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
52649	52789	Hi.
53149	54190	How are you, DarkSakura?
54310	55150	I have hobbit shoes.
55371	57052	Why am I not hearing you at all?
57072	57492	Am I muted?
57552	59494	The fabulousness of live radio.
59614	60054	Try again.
60214	60955	Much better.
61115	61375	Okay.
61835	62656	I'm wearing my hobbit shoes.
63216	64177	What is the hobbit shoes?
64505	67808	I have Vibram Five Finger multi-sport shoes.
67928	69429	They're the shoes that look like feet.
69689	70390	They're not really shoes.
70410	71091	I'll take a picture.
71111	73393	They're like Spiderman webbing that go on your feet.
73553	74754	They're foot gloves.
75094	76936	They're the strangest things I've ever seen.
77116	82400	But they're comfortable and when they break in they're supposed to be really good for your feet and give you a natural stride.
82480	83661	Would you play DDR in those?
83822	84762	Yeah.
85023	86044	I've seen people do it before.
86144	86864	Might be interesting.
87785	89186	Play some Dance Central.
89827	90287	Shake your booty.
90307	91328	I'm not going to play Dance Central.
91408	92349	I'm going to play Dance Masters.
93106	93647	Really?
93807	94888	Oh, Dance Central's great.
94908	95649	Para, para.
95870	99495	Dance Masters gets old after like the first five songs you play.
99775	100055	Don't care.
100396	100936	All right, whatever.
100956	103039	Let's see if Tech Master Loki cares.
103079	103440	Hi, Loki.
104059	105460	I don't care about Dance Masters.
105480	106420	And we don't hear you either.
106460	107360	What is going on?
108421	109761	It's called ill preparation.
109921	110542	Apparently.
110642	112602	I don't know what this is all about tonight.
112642	113283	Plus that mic.
113943	114643	Something's up with it.
114683	115023	I don't know.
115343	117064	You've been getting quieter and quieter every week.
117084	118485	It's because I'm talking quieter and quieter.
118505	119525	They get really loud!
119605	120225	Exactly.
121206	123106	That's why we have to be careful how we tune it for you.
123127	124107	I do that on purpose.
124327	124687	Alright.
125007	126188	Well, how's your week been, Loki?
126648	127168	It's been fine.
127328	127528	Yeah?
128188	128629	Good times?
129109	130629	Anything exciting going on with the baby?
130649	131090	Growing?
131130	131450	Getting older?
131490	131930	Getting older.
132301	136344	He's eating some... He's starting solid foods, I guess.
136384	137725	I saw the avocado post.
137785	143349	He's eating avocado, rice cereal, and... What else?
144029	145771	When's it okay to start feeding a baby bacon?
146511	147432	Not for a long time.
148012	148473	What a bummer.
149113	152596	He's getting... Well, it's avocado, rice cereal, and... Cheerios!
152616	154437	I think that's actually it.
154537	155578	Avocado and rice cereal.
156739	160942	But then he's going to be eating... I think carrots this week.
162301	163462	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
189378	190619	That's just fabulous.
191219	193721	Our 400th episode is going to be the same day as the Super Bowl.
194682	196603	I don't know if we really have anything exciting planned, though.
196643	201226	I mean, it's just, I don't know, it's just, after this long... I have something exciting planned.
202027	204349	I know you've got a little something.
204469	208111	But both of you need to actually stay instead of depart super quick after the show.
208292	210533	I've offered I don't know how many times, but anyway.
211654	213715	You're not the one I'm worried about, Loki.
213795	214036	Okay.
214736	216357	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
245432	250776	I made level 75 on World of Warcraft and got two of my friends to play.
252738	253018	Addict.
254019	254699	Now I'm the dealer.
255960	258863	It's called Pyramid Scheme, I say.
259844	260924	Pyramid Head Scheme.
262726	272554	And I played some Portal and some more Mushihime-sama and lots of Solitaire because I was at school.
274241	283262	and I updated and installed my own Linux Mint 10 by myself on two computers and fixed the networking problems.
283792	290714	Now, I know I've heard you talk favorably of Linux Mint before as something you like to use as another OS besides just Windows.
291514	296375	What is the advantage, I guess, of doing Linux on one system and Windows on the other?
297015	302076	Specifically in the case of my netbook, it uses less memory and less space.
302996	309238	And if I need to, I can actually boot it off of a USB that I've installed Linux on.
309998	322357	So, say that this computer that I'm on now, say that something goes haywire in it, all I have to do is boot it off Linux and I can run through the file system, and if I need to delete something, I can.
323238	323618	Good times.
324420	325301	It works on everything.
325421	325921	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
352279	353840	So that's it for DarkSakura's Gaming Week.
353860	354801	We'll move on over to Loki.
354821	355502	How was your Gaming Week?
356142	356723	It was okay.
356743	358404	I played a couple things.
359405	362468	I tried, I don't know, just the hell of it.
363108	369274	I tried that one free game that was made by that 14-year-old or something like that, some bubble something or other.
370094	373457	And it was okay for a few minutes.
373497	376400	And I was like, wow, this looks like a really cheaply made game.
377140	377901	And I got bored with it.
378604	379565	Why do you think it's doing so well?
379585	381045	This is that iPhone, iTouch game.
381065	391291	Oh, because people like fucking human interest stories, and because people are simpletons, and they like free shit, and as long as it has a good storytelling, well, I better support it, because a 14-year-old made it.
391811	392171	Great.
392691	395013	You know, 14-year-olds make a lot of shit.
396774	397094	Usually.
398795	400035	But, you know, whatever.
400055	405838	These are the same people who like Angry Birds, so, you know, what am I... It's not a stretch for them, I guess.
406859	406959	Um...
408487	415412	Then I literally dusted off my PS3 to finally put the 500... Those things are dust magnets.
416253	417674	You don't dust them off.
417734	418495	They'll turn gray.
419406	437014	Yeah, so I dusted it off, and I finally installed my 500 gig hard drive that I had for it, and then I did the noble thing, and I installed a custom firmware on it, and now all my systems are modded as they should be.
437514	438335	You're so proud.
438775	443117	It was seriously the black sheep of the bunch, and now it's all perfect.
444762	455432	I know I've read stories about systems bricking and stuff like that, but seriously, if you just wait a little bit to make sure everything's okay, let the dust settle, you're all good.
456847	457848	So easy to do.
457928	460250	It's seriously scary.
461451	461971	So I did that.
462572	465354	And then played a little bit of Planet 2.
465394	467055	A little bit of that.
467356	469057	Just a few levels.
469717	470958	Actually, just one online level.
471739	473260	And it's fun.
473440	474421	I like LittleBigPlanet 1.
475782	476723	I mean, that was a fun game.
476903	479205	And LittleBigPlanet 2, obviously very similar to that.
479245	480966	They have some new features that they added in there.
481427	483809	I don't really care for the grappling hook too much.
484369	484469	And...
485850	504627	And I don't know if it's just the design of the DualShock 3 analog sticks or something like that, but for some reason, I was having issues with it trying to swing my character back and forth and having the grappling hook change length, which would normally be controlled by the up and down on the analog.
505307	510151	Even though I'm not pushing up and down on the analog, it was just very... The dead zones for it were really...
512473	513814	Really large, I guess.
514214	520857	So it was difficult to accurately get it to swing and adjust the size of the grappling hook and stuff like that.
521397	523098	So it actually killed my character one time.
524887	525908	It's alright, it's kind of cool.
526108	533713	And then I played someone's user-created levels, the first-person shooter Resident Evil thing, and that was actually kind of cool.
533833	538356	Definitely different and a good indicator of what you can do with LittleBigPlanet 2.
539017	543740	And then there was also a top-down RPG game that someone made, which I tried out.
543760	544441	That was pretty cool.
545161	571048	so um lots of unique stuff and I like how they're kind of hinting at some of the things that you can do in like the first few levels like they have the ability where you can link two different levels together or more than two levels together so like for example say you want to create you know like a Mario Brothers game you can do that you can create all the different levels and just link them all together and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before somebody does create Mario Brothers in LittleBigPlanet it's probably already happened actually oh I'm sure it already has
572208	575131	But it's really cool.
575311	584280	I've been trying to play it for the longest time, but trying to be able to play a game on my big TV is not really working out for me.
584600	587243	Thankfully, though, and this will also kind of help out with...
588244	590587	If I have to ever stream DJ Hero 3 or something.
591048	594973	I have a new capture card for my laptop that I can just plug in USB.
595374	599379	So it allows me to play games and just hook straight up to my laptop and I can play it off the screen.
599399	599920	No lag.
599980	605287	So that'll give me an additional screen to play a little Big Planet on.
605851	611574	Go to our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com There's some people that are asking about your hacking habits.
612475	614856	BlackWolf says, Now you never have to pay for another game.
614917	615217	Yay!
615557	619759	Which is a very tongue-in-cheek comment from BlackWolf because he's actually very anti-video game piracy.
620440	622101	But, Loki, you do still buy games.
622121	627124	You bought, what, like seven copies of Grand Theft Auto 4 on various systems or something?
627544	628745	It's not like you don't pay for games.
631306	633927	So then I guess this leads to the question from AkumaJP.
634267	636648	Loki, what is the benefit of custom firmware for the PS3?
637668	638288	Lots of things.
639048	642229	One, you can play all the different homebrew stuff that they have on there.
642329	645030	You can add different features to your system.
645210	649851	It's just really early, so a lot of the stuff we don't know yet what you're going to be able to do with it.
649931	658454	But yes, there's definitely the backing up portion of it that you can back up games and pirate stuff if you want to.
660094	660675	Will I do that?
660775	664959	Probably not, because I had the ability to jailbreak my PS3 for the longest time.
664999	669483	I actually had the tools to do it, but I just didn't... There was no reason.
669543	675449	I literally sat there going, well, I could do this and pirate a bunch of games, but there's no real games I want to play.
676249	678091	So it's like, that's sad.
679032	684217	If I really don't want to... If there's nothing I really want to play on there, then I don't know.
684717	702906	but as long as I've known you and as long as I've been doing this show with you you've always kind of been the type to me that just likes to do it because you can like you know because somebody's like you're not supposed to hack your PS3 to be able to run this and you're you're very much the type that's like well yes I can you know I'm gonna do it anyway pretty much yeah
703607	704887	So, alright.
705547	705868	Anyhow.
707248	708108	Is that it for your gaming week?
708168	711529	Oh, I wanted to ask you something about Little Big Planet 2.
711889	712289	Excuse me.
713749	714690	Little Big Planet 2.
716450	718010	You mentioned there's some new features and so forth.
718030	722432	What was one of the first things that jumped out to you you noticed was different about the game from Little Big Planet 1?
722492	722552	Um...
726855	728436	I mean the springboards, I guess.
728456	731498	That was like the first thing that they show that's different.
732399	739304	I like it did import my character and all my stuff they had collected in the first game, which is kind of cool.
742597	745039	I don't... There's not a lot right now that's different.
745179	757811	It's just a few different things, but I mean, I know that the game is going to be really... Because it's kind of... I'm still going through the first few levels of the game, or the tutorial levels, you know, so they haven't really introduced a ton of stuff yet.
757911	761535	It's just very much like the first game right now.
762376	762456	Um...
763956	791163	but that's alright because the first game was awesome I do like how they had some voice acting in the game like the cutscenes, the cutscenes are actually very unique and then also like how and I'm not sure if the Da Vinci character or whatever is voiced by John Cleese but it sounds like it and then later on because they only have voice acting through the cutscenes through the rest of the game he's just kind of mumbling and it sounds like John Cleese mumbling which is kind of funny
791710	795012	I thought they had gotten his talent to voice something.
795072	798094	I don't know if it was that, but maybe a different... No, it was Fable 3 I'm thinking of.
798294	799055	Yeah, he was the butler.
812483	813083	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
835098	862369	and it's for the phones and it's basically a DOS emulator for the iPhone and what you can do is that there's various like DOS games that were actually kind of included in the little store that come with it like Duke Nukem the original side scroller is in it and Wolfenstein 3D the shareware episode is available there and so on and let's see I can actually fire up I'm going to fire up Wolfenstein 3D here real quick on the phone so you can kind of see this and
863209	869931	The only thing that kind of sucks about it, which actually is a really big drawback, is that, again, the iPhone makes for a shitty controller.
870051	870892	A very shitty controller.
870932	876854	Especially when there's like eight different buttons on here to be able to play this, which is next to impossible.
877274	886797	So you can kind of like... I don't know if you can hear the old school AdLib sound effects there in the mic, but... Yeah.
886817	886897	Yeah.
888208	888889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
911085	919974	The only one I wanted to get that got pulled immediately was Minecrafted, which was the Minecraft client for... Really?
920014	921015	I didn't even know they had that.
921175	922377	Yeah, it was very brief.
922817	927662	It's supposed to be coming back later, but it was a leaked version of it.
928483	930545	Funny that you mentioned Duke Nukem and stuff like that.
931426	941041	Well, Duke Nukem was on the store, I think, already, and then Wolfenstein's actually available through, well, through Cydia if you have a jailbroken device.
941402	942023	Which I don't.
942103	942383	I don't know.
942423	942824	I'm like, I...
945020	949844	I know hella people jailbreak their iPhone and they even came out in the courts and said that you can or whatever, but I don't know.
950184	955569	I'm all paranoid about that stuff because this thing is like my life, my texting, my phone.
955629	957771	I can't have it go wrong.
958511	962294	It's not worth it to relive Wolfenstein 3D all over again, you know what I mean?
962334	963135	No, it's not.
963155	964756	So that's kind of my perspective on it.
965788	967530	Alright, so that was really it for my gaming week.
967550	969051	Otherwise, just more of the same stuff.
969071	973395	You know, WoW, Pac-Man, the new Championship Edition Deluxe, and so forth.
973895	975657	So, that's it for my week.
976297	978639	Some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's news.
979100	980561	You can, of course, follow us on Twitter.
980841	982843	Twitter.com slash OLR.
983223	987125	We're also available on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
987665	995208	And of course we do tape live at All Games Radio, AllGames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.
995228	1000471	If you ever do want to come in and join a live episode, please do join us sometime.
1001711	1005273	Maybe you can sync your iPhone with a PS3.
1005313	1007934	They were saying use it as a router for a controller.
1008374	1010195	Well, you don't even have to really necessarily do that.
1010275	1023020	Some actual homebrew programs through like Cydia and stuff like that allows you to sync a Wii Remote to your iPod or iPad to play Nintendo or Super Nintendo games.
1024020	1024960	It's just not worth it.
1025621	1026901	It's pretty awesome, though.
1027381	1027861	Too much.
1028121	1029622	Too much work for not enough payoff.
1030082	1030342	All right.
1030662	1032563	Let's move on to tonight's news.
1032623	1034684	We will start off with, of course, the one and only Loki tonight.
1035424	1037945	Yes, so it's kind of sad.
1038565	1044306	They were trying to find a buyer for Bizarre Entertainment or Bizarre Creations or whatever.
1045047	1049168	And unfortunately, Activision was unable to do so.
1049608	1057070	I mean, dude, they put out some pretty awesome racing games and hell, they had a pretty awesome arcade shooter game.
1058911	1066316	I can't believe no one wanted to buy the developer of the original Project Gotham games and Geometry Wars, which was huge.
1066356	1067337	Microsoft, hello!
1068477	1069338	I'm shocked.
1070118	1070439	Shocked.
1071479	1075542	But anyways, this is kind of a trend if you think about it.
1075582	1076582	Look at Harmonix.
1077283	1080585	Nope, no buyers for Harmonix either, other than themselves.
1081846	1083507	I don't know, maybe just people aren't snapping up...
1085845	1086285	and DarkSakura.
1103789	1104629	I mean, come on, though.
1104970	1105750	What do you expect?
1106090	1107531	And this is Activision's fault.
1107671	1108151	I'm sorry.
1108171	1109531	This is plainly their fault.
1110092	1116094	What do you expect when you release a okay first-person shooter the week before Black Ops?
1116474	1117175	I mean, seriously.
1117195	1118255	You expect it to do well?
1118315	1118495	No.
1118515	1119996	They expect it to die.
1122057	1123477	So, I don't know.
1124058	1129380	It could have done a lot better if it was released in a different part of the year or next year or whatever.
1129960	1132942	And it really was, oh, well, we have the license to the Bond series.
1133102	1134783	Ah, crap, they're not making another movie.
1135323	1139445	Well, we need to make some money off of this license we paid for, so let's make a game.
1140525	1143366	And ironically, now they are making another Bond movie.
1143506	1144687	Didn't they announce that a couple weeks ago?
1145287	1146468	And they're just making another game?
1146768	1146908	Huh.
1148109	1148469	Interesting.
1148489	1149009	It's not bizarre.
1149970	1150810	It's just such a bummer.
1150890	1171361	I mean, I had heard somewhere, I don't remember, it was earlier in the week, so forgive me if my memory is a little rusty, but there's some type of new tax in, I don't know if it's Britain, the greater part of Britain, or if it's just this area that the Bizarre Creation studio is in that has something to do with video games that actually may have had an impact that maybe was too expensive to keep these guys up and running where they're at now.
1172381	1177608	It's one of those, you know, it's cheaper to get folks in another country to do the development or whatever.
1177628	1183576	Yeah, well, they're basically recommending that they close them now is the recommendation, I guess.
1184457	1188463	And I guess they recently did the same thing with Budcat in the U.S.
1188891	1197376	Well, I'm hoping that, you know, it's one of those for every door that closes and other opens type of scenarios where at least these guys might get, you know, on their feet somewhere else.
1198076	1202899	Or maybe they'll do that thing where they start up their own darn studio, which we've seen a lot of developers in the past do.
1203039	1203419	You never know.
1203919	1205020	Try some different ideas.
1206201	1209202	I can't believe that means there's never going to be another Geometry Wars game.
1209322	1209943	Eh, whatever.
1210263	1211524	Unless, well, I don't know.
1211564	1212264	I really like that series.
1212284	1213725	I ain't really going to improve upon that, I mean.
1214405	1226740	I guess you could look at it that way but I and I guess technically what Activision would own that so they could always have one of their other developing houses do it but I don't know just it wouldn't be the same yeah
1227913	1229654	Well, that's too bad.
1230274	1232876	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com for some comments.
1233616	1240999	Isam in our chatroom says, this is probably a time where they would rather purchase intellectual properties to re-release rather than take on new employees.
1241699	1243280	AlphaCanadagram says, WTF?
1243400	1245121	Geometry Wars 2 was the shit.
1245761	1264750	I agree, Geometry Wars 2 is awesome and it's kind of a bummer but maybe since the Xbox Live Arcade especially and I guess to some extent the PlayStation Network is pretty easy to develop for I mean, I don't know, I'm not a video game developer but I am assuming that what, the folks that put out Super Meat Boy not exactly a large development studio, correct?
1264830	1267791	Wasn't it like three or four different people kind of buds getting together doing this game?
1268211	1268551	Pretty much.
1268871	1274614	Granted it's not on PlayStation Network but it could have been because I think they have some dealio with Microsoft
1275174	1294629	so my hope maybe these guys that end up losing their stuff at Bazaar can kind of go and develop maybe for these smaller platforms like handhelds and Xbox Live Arcade the Geometry Wars-esque sort of games or whatever other ideas they might have because you know Blur was a pretty good idea too that was a
1296601	1316973	I really think if there had been a Blur 2 it would have been awesome Blur 1, it was a good game but it did need some work but I love that idea of the arcade racer meets Mario Kart and the commercials for that were always so awesome where it was the little Mario Kart cute characters that are practically getting run over by the adult cars or better yet, make it an arcade game
1317788	1318248	Perhaps.
1319089	1319490	Perhaps.
1320430	1322232	Derek H in our chatroom seems to agree with me.
1322372	1324634	I hope the people from Bizarre reform a new studio.
1325054	1326896	I hope so too, or at least a good portion of them.
1327236	1328558	I hear Respawn's hiring.
1330299	1331120	Never know what might happen.
1331559	1332659	All right, moving on to some other news.
1332679	1339421	And this has something to do with kind of like basement development, if you will, on a very large scale.
1339841	1346122	StarCraft II, of course, you know, has some very flexible development materials, we'll say, in the game.
1346523	1349463	And people have been able to make all sorts of games within StarCraft II.
1349523	1356785	Hell, there's an endorsed by Blizzard shooter that's actually in the game, like a shoot-em-up type game that's there.
1357125	1358626	StarCraft Universe StarCraft Universe
1383783	1388745	Well, there were some teasers that were up on the internet and they got pulled pretty quickly.
1389145	1391827	Blizzard put the smackdown on those and took them down.
1392607	1398449	And a lot of people were saying, Boo, Blizzard, you guys are a bunch of bastards for taking this stuff down.
1398490	1399230	Why would you do that?
1400390	1410255	And the modder who created this, Ryan Winzel, even kind of went on his own forum saying, I don't really know what's going on right now, you guys.
1410275	1412196	This is all kind of developing at a fast pace.
1412236	1412876	Well, here's the deal.
1413496	1423164	Activism Blizzard is actually not trying to shut down this mod altogether, but I think the problem that they're having is that it's the World of Starcraft name that they don't like.
1423704	1427447	They don't want this guy making his mod called World of Starcraft.
1427887	1431850	So it looks like this MMO is actually going to continue on, but under a new name.
1432611	1439956	By the way, Ryan Wenzel, the modder, has actually been invited by Blizzard to go meet the Starcraft 2 development team.
1440817	1441317	Interesting.
1441438	1443519	Also, this whole thing expanded so fast.
1443899	1447802	He was also invited by the folks that made the MMO League of Legends.
1447822	1450063	I don't know if you've seen that, but that's like Defense of the Ancients.
1450343	1454646	Actually, that is a game I did get to see like 15 seconds of a little bit this weekend.
1454686	1458469	One of my friends is into that, and it's like a Defense of the Ancients kind of like game, the old mod.
1458869	1461951	The people that make that invited this guy to go interview with him.
1462031	1465333	So his net celebrity went up exponentially real quick.
1465474	1466014	That's cool.
1466034	1466574	Yeah, it's kind of cool.
1466774	1470097	It was cool that he was invited by Blizzard, though, because Blizzard was like, dude, dude, dude.
1470777	1473098	It's not the mod we're not cool with.
1473439	1474219	It's the name.
1474419	1476641	So hopefully they're going to be able to work this out.
1476661	1477601	Blizzard wanted to make it clear.
1478041	1487587	It was never our intention to stop development on the mod, but with the name so closely resembling that of World of Warcraft, we wanted to discuss the title of the mod with the developer.
1487927	1494271	And as part of our routine procedure, we contacted YouTube to request the video be removed while that discussion took place.
1495292	1498234	Such a little politically correct way of saying that.
1500075	1500215	So...
1500715	1501416	Interesting, huh?
1502717	1504859	Yeah, it's like we're not trying to be jerks, but no.
1506440	1508261	It's all branding and identity.
1508602	1519331	I think what's going on here, the unsaid part too, is it's a lot of that big company syndrome where I'm sure the developers actually kind of had their eyebrows raised going, that's kind of cool what this kid did.
1519711	1524015	Whereas the legal team and the protections of all this were like, hell no, shut it down.
1524375	1525635	You don't protect it, you lose it.
1525855	1526435	Exactly.
1527056	1531537	So I think whereas the development team was like, yeah, come on over and play with us for a day.
1531617	1532697	Let's see what you're up to.
1532977	1537218	The legal team was like, hell no, you need to shut it down under this name.
1537778	1540559	So it's kind of interesting how that all works together.
1541819	1543039	That sounds very corporate to me.
1545500	1547220	Well, you know what else is stupid?
1547440	1548260	What is stupid?
1548360	1548921	Nintendo.
1549441	1549681	What?
1550001	1550601	You don't say.
1551255	1567279	Well, basically, they were talking to Kotaku and said that they didn't see any reason to put in some sort of trophy or achievement system because they don't want to tell people how to play the games to get some kind of, quote, mythical reward.
1568820	1570300	The U.S.
1570740	1579323	exec Bill Trennan quoted saying, basically, the way the games are designed is they're designed for you to explore the game yourself and have a sense of discovery.
1580243	1584510	So, it's like, we don't want to give you directions on what to do in the game.
1584570	1586213	We want you to find everything on your own.
1587595	1588616	Which, I understand that.
1588697	1591341	And they said that they're not really against the idea of trophies.
1592062	1595247	They just don't want it to be the whole purpose for playing the game.
1595731	1597891	They believe that except for Super Smash Bros.
1597991	1598251	Brawl.
1598772	1599852	In which case they don't care about that.
1599872	1600692	That's what I said.
1600872	1603372	They are not against them.
1604593	1607113	It's just that they don't want that to be the full basis of the game.
1607373	1617035	I just don't think they want to license the rights to... You know how a lot of these people copyright different things or have patents for trophy systems and stuff like that.
1617515	1619215	They probably just don't want to license that crap.
1619815	1621456	I have no idea and neither do I care.
1621716	1623176	It's just they...
1624742	1627164	I kind of think it's interesting that they went on a limb to say this.
1627604	1628846	Since everybody else is doing it.
1629506	1636572	Once Xbox started having it, PlayStation had it, and they have them in MMOs and all kinds of stuff.
1637332	1638193	Even on our phone.
1638634	1641436	Way to not embrace something that's popular right now.
1642497	1645460	Online gameplay, whatever, we don't need that.
1645861	1647723	Trophies, we don't need that.
1648204	1650166	Organized community, whatever.
1651868	1652249	I don't know.
1652369	1658056	I get this story and all, but it strikes me a little bit as a reason that's invented after the fact.
1658837	1668085	Like, the Wii simply was not programmed to have this type of functionality in it, and I sort of get that because the Wii doesn't have anything like Xbox Live, like PlayStation Network.
1668125	1676131	There's no centralized Wii service, except for, granted, Wii Connect 24, the thing that lets you send the mails and all that stuff, and the friend code to play online.
1676511	1677812	But I don't know, like, it just...
1678593	1685276	I don't know enough about how computers talk to each other and how the internet actually works, but it doesn't strike me as quite the centralized system that the other two are.
1685356	1687997	It could be patched in later if they really wanted to.
1688597	1689658	They did it with the PSP.
1689998	1691279	Or they're launching a new console.
1692399	1694960	You know, they could kind of roll it out with that if they wanted to.
1695120	1695460	I don't know.
1695841	1702884	I just feel like there might be a little more value in virtual console, especially if they're going to try to get us to buy the same games again on the 3DS.
1703864	1709868	to have some type of trophy room for actually having played these games and getting scores on them.
1709969	1715372	I mean, even if it's just a freaking high score table, fuck, I'd take Game Center over nothing.
1715753	1716433	You know what I mean?
1717174	1723318	And Game Center, not that great, but it's better than... I also personally don't care about achievements myself.
1723898	1726040	I just play the games to enjoy them and have fun.
1728242	1733646	I do, I get that, but it's sort of like, it's kind of nice to have that little pat on the back.
1733706	1735147	To have that in your portfolio.
1735167	1739030	The only reason I've tried to get any achievements in World of Warcraft is for the experience.
1739631	1741552	Because, you know, I've got experience points for it.
1742373	1742793	Yeah.
1742833	1743393	That's it.
1743994	1746095	You get experience points for doing like quests and stuff.
1746176	1748117	I got them for getting the exploration ones.
1749193	1750334	Oh yeah, because you get experiences.
1750354	1751435	Yeah, I get it.
1751875	1754517	But other than that, I don't care.
1755717	1762442	I laughed at that one because I thought it was funny, but other than that, it was like, okay, someone did something that they were going to be doing anyway.
1762522	1767325	Well, since you bring that up, Blizzard also doesn't really have a centralized server for achievements.
1768186	1769627	This came up on a previous episode of Horde House.
1770027	1774450	You can't link your StarCraft and your Warcraft achievements together right now.
1775010	1778933	Maybe when Diablo comes out, there'll be some type of Blizzard centralized thing.
1779693	1806100	But then again, that'll only ever be for Blizzard games It's never going to connect to the Steam And all the Steam achievements I get that it's starting to get a little fragmented It is a little silly that you have your set on the Wii And your set on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 And it really should just be about beating the game start to finish But I don't know, I sort of like having that little sticker in my book That says, you did something really weird in this game Rob, I know how we can fix that problem How?
1807639	1808179	We send out patches.
1823385	1826786	And I'm pretty sure that's where the whole idea of achievements on the 360 came from in the first place.
1846654	1853703	It's really a bummer, actually, that when they did Game Room, you didn't have any type of resurgence of this, you know what I mean?
1853723	1857087	I guess there were the little trophies in Game Room, but it wasn't quite the same, you know?
1857747	1864135	Because patches are expensive, and if a publisher doesn't have to make unnecessary expenses like that, they won't.
1864500	1865101	Thanks for watching!
1881878	1906640	Spaginator in our chatroom says I wonder if they'll ever be a Diablo MMO It's kind of World of Warcraft actually When I first played World of Warcraft I was feeling a lot more Diablo than I was Warcraft Because Warcraft is an RTS And World of Warcraft really isn't So it's interesting Derek H says he had a patch for Barnstorming And DefectiveCandy says my grandfather had one of those patches So some people remember those patches
1907267	1908088	Well, see, that's the thing.
1908388	1909429	That's how awesome it was.
1909489	1911391	People are still talking about them today.
1912112	1914475	See, if they did that now, that would be awesome.
1914615	1916957	People would be talking about them for a long time.
1917938	1920160	But now, missed opportunity.
1920281	1921422	It's all about cash now.
1923224	1923764	Unfortunate.
1923924	1925366	All right, well, what else is in the news, Loki?
1926425	1926765	3DS 3DS 3DS
1951255	1964839	Not really certain on which games are going to make the launch, although two that have been nailed down in the launch period by Nintendo, coming from Nintendo, unfortunately are Pilotwings and Nintendogs Plus Cats.
1968519	1970940	I liked Pilotwings back on the Super Nintendo.
1971000	1972060	It looked neat.
1972100	1973461	The Pilotwings game looked neat.
1973481	1974661	Nintendogs and Cats...
1978174	1979617	I know the game's gonna suck.
1980098	1981159	I know.
1981440	1983303	It's like, it looks awesome.
1983483	1986048	It would be awesome to try, but I don't want it.
1986108	1989473	Because I know I will get bored with it so quick.
1989914	1990295	It's just...
1991167	1992168	I know exactly what you mean.
1992188	1993588	It's just like the original Nintendogs.
1993608	1995809	You read about it on paper and all the features they're putting in.
1995829	1997950	You're like, oh man, this sounds like it's going to be really cool.
1998351	2000492	And then I just know it, just like the first Nintendogs.
2000552	2003233	I buy the game and it's going to be dumb after 30 minutes.
2003733	2004214	You know what I mean?
2004934	2006375	You're like, God.
2006395	2008336	I have to feed it every day.
2008356	2009636	I have to play with it every day.
2009656	2013919	Nintendogs is kind of, at least the original one, is kind of an overblown Facebook game.
2015039	2017500	The original Nintendogs has a lot in common with a Facebook game.
2018361	2020742	I can't explain it, but it's what it feels like to me.
2023473	2035460	Some of the interesting things that they were talking about, which is kind of weird, is the system actually has a pedometer built into it and you get coins by walking around.
2036060	2040463	So you earn coins that you can spend in games for different things.
2042242	2047927	and then they have an activity log or whatever attracts your gameplay as well as your steps.
2048768	2057255	They're also talking about how you can make Miis in the interface and they have that cool feature where you can take a picture of yourself and they give you a bunch of different options for Miis and stuff.
2057535	2059217	You can import your Miis from the Wii
2059741	2060622	But you can't go the other way.
2061103	2069634	Yeah, just because it's... Well, because they say it's more complex than the Wii system.
2069674	2072178	The one on the 3DS is Wii 2.0.
2072618	2075742	Yeah, and it makes sense because if you think about it though, like...
2077410	2077610	I think.
2106823	2108243	What do you guys think about that price point?
2108263	2108923	$250 for a 3DS.
2108943	2110904	Do you think that's fair?
2110924	2111904	Do you think it's too much?
2112164	2114364	Because there's some people on the internet that say, you know what, that's too much.
2116025	2116725	I think it's fine.
2117025	2121126	I think it makes sense because they're not going to really have any competition right now.
2121646	2125426	And I guarantee that thing will be selling for a lot more than that.
2125466	2126947	You're not going to be able to find these things.
2127587	2133988	So you get your orders in while you can and if you're savvy enough, buy two and sell one on eBay.
2134048	2134288	Okay.
2137496	2138217	I kind of agree.
2138257	2141519	I think the price point is actually better than what I was expecting.
2141759	2149124	I thought it was going to be 3DS, $300 was what I was originally thinking they were going to do with it, but no, this is actually lower than I thought.
2149204	2152887	It's right at what I expected, based on what they put out the end retail price.
2153627	2154068	It makes sense.
2154888	2159249	and it kind of leaves them a little room to lower it later.
2159409	2162790	Like if they want to do a cut for Christmas, they probably will.
2163511	2166491	You know, they could cut it to 200 by Christmas with some type of package.
2166952	2167552	I don't think they will.
2167792	2168532	I don't think they need to.
2169052	2175734	I think it's going to be like the Wii where it was in short supply for a very long time and they're not going to cut that thing for at least a year.
2176534	2177935	At least a year.
2178095	2178655	It brings money.
2180400	2183222	The price cut will come when probably a new system revision will come out.
2183642	2187264	I guarantee you that thing will not be dropping in price by the end of this year.
2188165	2189286	Every kid will want one, too.
2189626	2191507	Every freaking kid.
2191527	2193088	It's 3D without glasses.
2193328	2194149	I mean, come on.
2194749	2196290	People are like, oh, it's so stupid.
2196310	2202294	People are just going to be blown away by just seeing the actual screens.
2202314	2203375	They're just going to be blown away.
2203395	2203755	Yeah.
2208281	2216992	I don't even want to quote certain analysts, but there's people out there that have said they could have charged more than that and they could have still sold all the units that they had.
2217773	2219035	So, I don't know.
2221287	2234120	I'm looking at some of the comments in our chat room GameGuru says 250 is a bit too expensive for a handheld game system Tigerclaw says when you put the 3DS with the PSP Go from the price standing point the 3DS has the most features How much was the PSP Go?
2234140	2235522	Was the PSP Go 250 as well?
2235622	2239886	Yeah, but see, okay, there's a difference with the PSP Go and the 3DS, okay
2241027	2242429	Thanks for watching!
2258334	2285212	and you couldn't buy games for it in stores so it had people scratching their heads like why do you want me to get this there's no enhancements to it other than onboard storage which memory is so cheap nowadays it doesn't matter there's no UMD drive so I can't play any of the games I normally have right now there's no way for me to convert them into a digital format I have to re-buy my games if I want to buy the system um
2287757	2291438	There's some Bluetooth support, great.
2292819	2304583	But the thing is, and this is the best part, their retail partners or whatever, like GameStops and stuff like that, or just mom and pop shops, they weren't bringing them in.
2304603	2313686	Well, GameStop might have because they have better partnerships with these guys, but individual mom and pop shops were not bringing them in because what money are they going to make off it?
2314047	2315367	The system they're making no money on.
2315367	2315807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2335726	2341548	Let me get to a couple more 3DS stories here and we'll kind of continue this discussion because there are some other interesting developments in the 3DS world.
2342808	2344129	Some of it has to do with online play.
2344209	2348290	First off, did you hear that the friend codes are getting reduced to one friend code?
2348390	2352151	So sadly, friend codes aren't going away, but it's one friend code for everything.
2352551	2353512	So you won't have a separate friend code.
2353532	2354032	Well, that's good.
2354392	2362714	Well, I still don't like the idea of a friend code, but I understand that they want that in there so that the rapists can't rape our children through the internet or something like that.
2362814	2363575	Hide your kids.
2363615	2364215	Hide your wife.
2367352	2372895	I still don't get why you can't just have a name instead of a 16-digit randomized code.
2373015	2383761	I mean, it's a step in the right direction, but when Nintendo is already three steps behind when it comes to online play, that news kind of just makes me go, whatever, Nintendo, whatever.
2384181	2395691	it's a good thing you figured the 3D thing out because I don't know otherwise but that is I guess whatever at least you only have the one friend code despite the fact that it'll not really be something customizable it is supposed to show you what your friends are playing though
2396758	2397779	That sounds like a little better.
2397839	2403903	Yeah, and there's apparently an app in it that will show you what the status is of your friends at any time.
2404063	2405705	So you can see what they're playing or what have you.
2405745	2409247	So a little more like you're familiar with Xbox Live, even though it's in an app.
2409908	2410248	Interesting.
2411089	2412650	Here's the other thing, though, that is kind of cool.
2412690	2415012	And to be fair, I should say this when it comes to friend codes.
2415492	2424118	If you are connected to another friend local on the local wireless, you can push a button to accept or send a friend request, and you won't ever have to exchange a number.
2424158	2426100	The 3DS will just automatically grab...
2427041	2429402	and there you have it, your friends.
2430063	2432124	So that's, okay, now that's a little better.
2432565	2434006	I like that part of it.
2434686	2442832	So if you will, and you're at a convention, you can push a button and get gang raped by friend requests.
2443933	2445935	Yeah, but it has to be a mutual button pressing.
2446995	2448376	What's a mutual button pressing?
2448396	2451138	Meaning you both have to accept the request.
2451258	2451679	You know what I mean?
2452740	2454621	It's a big old friend request gang bang.
2455811	2458853	I know, the next Penny Arcade Expo or E3, man.
2459513	2463655	You know, the 3DS will be out by this year's E3, so it's going to be kind of interesting to see how.
2463715	2473120	Now, I know E3 is not so much a fan event as it is a trade-slash-journalism event, but still, there's going to be, you know how many fanboys still manage to go to E3 because there are blogs and so forth.
2473580	2478883	You know, there'll be plenty of that exchanging and stuff going on.
2479423	2483866	I wonder if they're going to have like a booth like they did back when the DS was new where you could kind of do the download of the demos.
2483886	2483966	Yeah.
2484668	2485609	So I think that's a good idea.
2486090	2486751	That used to be cool.
2486791	2490335	That's how I played Meteos for the first time, which is still one of my favorite DS games to this day.
2490714	2491074	Electroplankton
2522275	2526497	I don't know if it was Shane or somebody.
2526517	2532920	Some people left their DS on and plugged in after E3 was over so they wouldn't lose the demo.
2533800	2538002	Some people had it for up to a week after the show was over just to still play it more.
2538483	2539263	It was a great puzzle game.
2541035	2545236	Anyhow, another quick story about the 3DS, and this has to do with the Virtual Console.
2545596	2553899	They did confirm, I mean, we kind of already knew this, but just a confirmation, Game Boy and Game Boy Color games will be coming to the Virtual Console.
2554339	2560260	Super Mario Land is the first confirmed, which, by the way, blows compared to other Mario games.
2560320	2561921	It doesn't even play like other Mario games.
2562321	2566342	You don't have a fireball, you have this random ball that bounces off walls.
2567242	2568583	It's like this Egyptian theme.
2568823	2570845	I don't think it was supposed to be Mario game at first.
2570885	2571965	I think it was supposed to be something else.
2572446	2572886	But whatever.
2573166	2574287	It's like Mr. Do.
2575728	2577549	No, well, okay, yeah, the weapon is.
2577609	2579670	I mean, the gameplay is still like a Mario game, but whatever.
2580491	2582532	So yeah, Super Mario Land is confirmed.
2583653	2588937	No word about advanced games, because keep in mind there's no longer an advanced slot on these things.
2589457	2593500	So no word yet if that's coming in the future or what.
2594580	2595061	So there you go.
2596857	2598358	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
2598658	2600079	Maybe something not about the 3DS?
2601320	2602461	Actually, no.
2602721	2610066	This actually has to do with... Well, it has something to do with Nintendo, but not specifically Nintendo's side.
2611227	2617491	Yoshinori Ono, who is the producer of Street Fighter 4, said he wants to make Nintendo vs. Capcom.
2619231	2631340	And, uh, he's, uh, quoted as saying that he wants to, uh, pitch it to, um, Masahiro Sakurai, who is the, uh, um, creator of Super Smash Bros.
2632240	2633781	So, I think that that would actually be kind of cool.
2633801	2638605	I mean, they're already doing Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and then we have, uh, Tekken and Street Fighter.
2639185	2640626	So, who knows?
2641647	2645770	Would you like to have Jigglypuff farting on Blanca or something?
2645790	2645870	Yeah.
2646050	2647291	That would be really odd.
2647771	2649191	I don't think they would ever do it.
2649491	2652312	It would kind of be a dopey game, but I don't know.
2653193	2654853	There's a lot of dopey games out there.
2654913	2657414	I don't necessarily mean that in a bad way.
2657994	2664437	If something's going to work with Nintendo, it's going to have to be like... I think Namco would do it.
2664657	2669399	All the Tekken games had weird characters like Gon and Yoda.
2670419	2671140	Why don't you just
2701140	2703102	I think that'll be the most that you see come of this.
2703182	2708948	I just think in a full Marvel vs. Capcom or even Tatsunoko vs. Capcom kind of way.
2708988	2710590	Unless they do all the cutesy characters.
2711631	2713693	Maybe all the cutesy Capcom characters could do it.
2713913	2715175	Cutesy Capcom battle!
2715195	2715295	Wee!
2715655	2719637	Tatsunoko vs. Capcom would be awesome with like a Mario character or something like that.
2719757	2722899	Or I could see them doing maybe like Link or something.
2723500	2727262	Like they ported Marvel vs. Capcom 3 or something to the Wii or something.
2727282	2729703	They could add Link in there and just like Soul Calibur.
2730043	2731744	Yeah, that maybe, maybe, maybe.
2732165	2734366	Super Chibi 3D Capcom Fighter.
2735747	2737027	That'll be the game that comes of it.
2737047	2739269	You know Capcom did Pakato Fighter.
2740169	2741370	Yep, so it's been done.
2742494	2759314	anything's possible I suppose so Ed Seaton Beaver in our chatroom says I mean Capcom characters would fuck up the stupid Nintendo characters I don't know though couldn't Kirby just go and you know just kind of have his way with the Capcom characters he does suck
2764004	2764845	Alright, I don't know.
2764905	2771808	Let the fanboy wank begin after that story, but I don't think anything will come of it except maybe in the next Super Smash Bros.
2771848	2773649	game, which will probably be on the 3DS.
2774709	2777891	Yeah, and everyone will get a big ol' heart on about it.
2778051	2784134	Oh my god, you can play it on the Wii, friend code, across galaxies and locally, and oh my god.
2785185	2785705	and Mii's.
2786086	2786686	Watch that.
2787146	2788927	There's going to be a Super Smash Bros.
2789387	2793129	fighter thingy on the stinking DS and your Mii will be a character.
2793289	2794290	That wasn't in the Wii version?
2795230	2795731	It might have been.
2795771	2796091	I don't know.
2797512	2797932	Maybe not.
2797952	2799633	It's been years since I've played it at this point.
2800613	2801114	I don't remember.
2801694	2804736	I like the little adventure part of that game.
2805416	2806637	The adventure stuff was cool.
2806657	2807237	I'll give you that.
2807297	2808638	That was a really cool part of the game.
2810199	2811919	Alright, let's move on with some release dates.
2811979	2814701	Travel the world and see what's coming out to a console near you.
2815131	2818473	It's not a lot of stuff coming out this week, but there is a couple good things.
2818754	2828220	Dead Space 2 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, as well as the collector's editions with the wonderful replica gun in there.
2829361	2832583	Paws and Claws Marine Rescue on Nintendo DS.
2834665	2840048	Two Worlds 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, as well as the Royal Edition of that.
2841990	2842090	Um...
2844051	2846674	and Lord of Arcana on PSP.
2848216	2849277	That, I believe, is it.
2850158	2850538	Alright.
2850739	2852380	I have to take a look here.
2852460	2853241	Yep, that is it.
2853502	2855484	Can we do things a little out of order and go to UK dates?
2855544	2856245	Oh no, never mind.
2857866	2861310	Sorry, my thing wasn't loading, but it just popped up.
2861931	2862732	I blame your thing.
2863012	2863272	Yes.
2863653	2864373	Stupid thing!
2865294	2868036	Dream Club Zero and Gal Gun are both coming out very soon on the 360 over in Japan.
2868056	2868457	Which I hear
2891314	2891675	DarkSakura.com
2899659	2901200	Though... Huh.
2901941	2902401	I did.
2902841	2904642	I don't... I have to recover that account.
2904883	2905583	Well, good luck with that.
2906083	2911067	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Dragon Age Origins gets its Japanese release.
2911207	2915069	I mean, I know that's a long time after we had it, but they've probably localized quite a bit for Japan.
2915470	2916150	So it took a little while.
2916510	2921874	Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Mindjack comes out, Shooting Studio, and Wizardry Twin Pack.
2922514	2925696	Like, is that like the old school C64 Wizardry games?
2926097	2927297	Like a new version of it?
2928178	2929339	They're RPG games.
2930560	2933662	Dude, I think these might be new versions of that old school game from the 80s.
2934603	2940807	Very, very text heavy in Japanese though, so you better be fluent in Japanese if you're going to import that.
2941147	2944049	Did you see that Zork is on good old games now?
2944289	2949993	I had heard about that, but you know, I can't justify paying what they want for Zork.
2950874	2978046	you know what I mean plus I had the whole resurgence you could play Zork on GameTap like back when GameTap was cool when Turner owned it you could play the Zork games and you know I kind of got my fill of retro back then and now I'm over it on the Nintendo Wii huge week on the Wii huge gigantic monumental week on the Wii the last story comes out this week that is a huge game I would be so excited if this game would come out in the US they have said nothing about it yet
2978274	2978754	DarkSakura
3002023	3004384	What are they going to talk about on the Wii at E3 this year?
3004804	3006104	There's nothing to talk about.
3006724	3020608	At least this would be something to hold people over because, again, if you don't know what this game is and why I'm so excited about it, it's a Mistwalker RPG on the Wii and the graphics actually look pretty phenomenal compared to the 360 and PS3 considering the Wii's
3020908	3021228	MissedWalker
3037446	3054919	but nothing about when it's coming out over here if ever besides that coilo comment that Loki already referenced just to like kind of put this in perspective when you look at like Japanese releases for February there are four games actually three because one of them is a collector's pack
3055279	3056920	Three games coming out in February.
3056940	3057760	Here it is, right here.
3057800	3059441	Nintendo of France.
3059981	3062743	It says they have no plans to localize the last story.
3063723	3066144	It says... Let's see here.
3066365	3067085	It's just fucking France.
3067105	3068346	No plans at the moment.
3068786	3070146	Don't listen to the guy from France.
3072047	3074589	It says the adaptation of this game could be very long.
3074609	3074909	12,000 dialogues.
3074929	3076550	Or it says it has 12,000 dialogues.
3079835	3081737	Listen up, Nintendo of France.
3082497	3086400	You need to surrender to the idea of having last story.
3086460	3090443	And their translation teams are overstretched in the short term.
3090483	3091204	Doing what?
3092064	3093225	I'll tell you what's going to happen.
3093786	3094807	Hackers will do this.
3096268	3097028	Hackers will.
3097048	3098009	Hackers going to hack.
3098189	3098830	You know what he's saying.
3098850	3099550	Hackers are going to translate this.
3099570	3100271	Hackers are going to hack.
3101452	3102813	And, you know, it will happen.
3102853	3103733	It will get released.
3104314	3107016	And that will piss people off.
3107817	3108317	I don't know.
3109057	3110098	I don't trust some guy.
3110278	3114779	If Reggie Fils-Aimé had come out and said it's not happening, then I'd believe it.
3115059	3121760	Some random executive with Nintendo of France says it and we're all supposed to accept that as the final word, I don't think so.
3122080	3122781	I say no.
3123341	3124061	No.
3124421	3127822	And then they followed it up with, I fought in your general direction.
3128402	3128882	Stop.
3131451	3132652	Moving on to the DS.
3134193	3139637	Actually, not a lot going on in the DS either, but this is a little more understandable, of course, because we have three DS on the horizon in February.
3139938	3148464	But there are a couple puzzle games and then a game called Sora no Otoshimono Forte Dreamy Season in regular and deluxe editions.
3149285	3154349	It's an adventure game that's coming out with three chibi little cartoony babes on the cover.
3154469	3159653	It looks like it might be some type of card game, but I do want to point out that this chick is not wearing pants in the screenshot.
3159893	3161234	She's wearing gym uniform.
3163911	3171543	Whatever, it looks like she's not wearing pants to me She's not wearing pants, she's wearing shorts Fine They're bloomers They're very short shorts They're bloomers
3171912	3173633	Well, they have to be agile.
3173933	3188901	Lastly, on the PS3, I'm sorry, PSP, Toaru Majutsu no Kinsho Mokuroku comes out from ASCII this week, which that game, it's a futuristic world with magic powers.
3188941	3189761	It's a fighting game.
3189801	3192543	It's kind of like Dissida, but just with general characters.
3192963	3194524	But this game might catch people's attention.
3194924	3197645	Valkyria Chronicles 3 Unrecorded Chronicles.
3197785	3200587	That comes out on PSP this week, so I'm sure that'll have its fans.
3201607	3202208	and importers.
3202708	3204329	Okay, now we can go to the UK, DarkSakura.
3204349	3204630	Sorry.
3205010	3205310	Okay.
3206151	3210113	On the 25th, we have Dead Space for the iPhone, sorry.
3210614	3219360	On the 28th, though, we have Dead Space 2 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360 and Mario Sports Mix and Yogi Bear the video game.
3221541	3224263	Have you seen the alternate ending, quote unquote, on YouTube?
3224423	3224623	No.
3224643	3226445	Where Boo Boo shoots Yogi Bear?
3226465	3226505	No.
3226665	3226845	No.
3228556	3230057	It's the alternate ending to the movie.
3231778	3232398	It's great.
3233539	3235500	That would mean you'd have to go see the movie, right?
3237281	3238622	And I would hate to see that movie.
3239903	3240503	No, you don't.
3240543	3241704	You just look it up on YouTube.
3242084	3247867	I understand that, but I don't want to even try to pretend to see that movie or part of the movie.
3248468	3249188	You don't understand.
3249248	3249709	It's awesome.
3249729	3250189	Wait, hold on.
3250229	3250549	Here it is.
3250589	3250889	Here it is.
3251550	3251890	Here it is.
3255618	3257559	And it's all the sad music and everything.
3258059	3262901	And Yogi Bear sees the little wanted ad for himself or whatever up on the wall.
3263841	3267342	There's Boo Boo looking all sad and pointing the gun.
3267362	3270864	Come on.
3272684	3273785	All this sad music.
3273865	3274225	God.
3276506	3279067	This, by the way, I started it like a minute and a half into it.
3279627	3279887	There you go.
3284008	3284488	Yay!
3284508	3285589	Wait, seriously, who did that?
3285609	3290871	I mean, because that's... I know, it looks... Some people say it might be a viral thing for the movie.
3291091	3294093	That they're saying it's independent, but it was actually like a viral thing.
3294753	3296534	And then there's the bear skin rug at the very end.
3297594	3299075	That's kind of wrong.
3299415	3302177	DarkSakura's rolling her eyes so far.
3304788	3316064	See now, if that movie had that kind of humor, like it was an adult movie with violence and titties How do you have titties in a Yogi Bear movie?
3316084	3316624	Who cares?
3317946	3322031	But if you had violence and titties in there, that might be a cool movie
3323530	3324611	I wouldn't see that.
3325692	3328393	I don't remember titties being in the old cartoon.
3328454	3329354	It doesn't matter.
3329454	3329915	Who cares?
3330255	3332536	I don't remember the cartoon being raped across.
3332737	3336839	Oh, it was now, but I don't remember it being terrible like this.
3338621	3340562	Of course, the chat room is asking for a link.
3341042	3342323	I'm trying to get one for you guys right now.
3342663	3344044	But let's get back.
3344064	3345025	Do we finish UK dates?
3345045	3345425	I'm sorry.
3345625	3346206	Yes, that's it.
3346366	3347667	Let's get back into some news, Loki.
3348206	3352238	Just don't understand why we can't have violence and titties in Yogi Bear.
3352398	3354404	It makes sense.
3355487	3356029	Think about it.
3357507	3366270	There was an Xbox 360 dashboard update this week, which pissed me off because that delayed me from playing my Grand Theft Auto game for a good half an hour.
3366710	3368390	Because our internet's really slow.
3368830	3372551	And the first thing I was worrying about is, is console amusing going to get banned?
3372571	3375492	Because it's flashed and not hot swapped like the rest of them.
3375512	3376352	Because I got lazy.
3376993	3377433	Anyways...
3379384	3380685	But no, that wasn't the case.
3380786	3390815	It was actually a small update to restore, I guess, the planned launch or whatever.
3391096	3397942	Basically the option where you can have the disk in the drive and when you start the system up it will actually play the game instead of going to the dashboard.
3398703	3402687	It was something I guess that broke in the last dashboard update.
3403027	3417831	and they will have a second update later this week because I guess they just didn't have time to finish the update to darken, I guess, your gamertag pictures or whatever it's going to be.
3418611	3421472	Instead of it being on green or something, now it's on dark gray.
3422799	3423299	which is stupid.
3423619	3424860	Oh, and the other thing... Let it change.
3425560	3425740	Yeah.
3426281	3437245	And the other thing is it also broke the ability to play backups of Call of Duty Black Ops, Mario Warfare 2, and of course, Halo Reach.
3438006	3439867	Also known as the real reason.
3440387	3441487	Yes, the real reason.
3442228	3445769	What it did was it added the... What was it?
3445809	3448790	The API 2.5 checks.
3448850	3450911	I think that's what they're calling it.
3451372	3451952	It's a new...
3454013	3461319	I guess an authenticity check that they've been adding to some new games to make sure they're not backed up.
3462100	3473328	And if, for example, you're playing one of these games and it happens to be backed up, your console gets flagged for banning on the next... We ban you!
3473649	3474509	...on the next go-around.
3475890	3476871	Unfortunately...
3480014	3507775	it doesn't always well they have the new light touch firmwares for the DVD drives already this is back when the first dashboard updates came out or actually the new checks and stuff came out and they've already patched it out on these drives assuming you have your drive up to date modded and stuff and there's some drives that actually don't support this at all so it doesn't matter you can patch it all you want but they can still play backups all they want and there's no way for them to check
3508691	3509472	So that really sucks.
3510472	3515616	Oh, and there's ways also to patch your games so that you're not checked by this too.
3516696	3519999	But at least you'll get a good chunk of the people that are playing that.
3520759	3528584	Me, on the other hand, I'm safe for now because I'm not playing Black Ops or Modern Warfare 2 or Halo Reach.
3528644	3532627	And unfortunately, I don't think they're going to be checking episodes of Liberty City.
3532967	3537390	Granted, I am playing a legit copy of episodes from Liberty City, but my drive is flashed.
3537990	3539031	in one of my consoles.
3539131	3539771	Naughty, naughty.
3540871	3541532	It's for testing.
3542192	3542572	Of course.
3542592	3543713	Because my JTAG's broken.
3543853	3545373	I have to test it on that right now.
3546214	3548255	Alright, I'm looking at our chatroom for some comments.
3548335	3551116	Of course, everybody's lit up about the adult Yogi Bear movie.
3551636	3555318	And Salacious Pop is practically writing the movie right now in some of the chatroom comments.
3556298	3556978	Hey, boo-boo.
3557759	3559399	Don't Bogart all the coke, boo-boo.
3559860	3560700	Fuck you, Yogi.
3562021	3564642	Hey, no bears allowed in the strip club, violent mauling.
3565560	3566660	What did you do to my car?
3566920	3569281	Yeah, you know that saying about bears only shitting in woods?
3569641	3570061	It's wrong.
3570381	3571501	Puts on aviator shades.
3571661	3572202	Yeah.
3575322	3577023	That would be awesome.
3577583	3581244	Actdeft in her chatroom says, Boo Boo has a right to bear arms.
3581564	3581904	Get it?
3585425	3585865	That's it.
3585885	3586025	Bye.
3592992	3599845	Ladies and gentlemen, it took 398 weeks, but this show has officially driven DarkSakura to the brink of sanity.
3600647	3601408	To madness.
3601949	3603152	I had sanity, ever.
3604875	3605216	That's true.
3606556	3608258	All right, moving on.
3608318	3611481	One other quick story for you guys, and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
3612161	3613582	Take it back to the old school way.
3614143	3616185	We'll kick it back 14 years right now.
3616525	3619408	Remember when they originally announced Duke Nukem Forever?
3620249	3621470	Oh boy, yes, that's right.
3621510	3626014	Duke Nukem Forever was that game that was announced before some of you were probably born.
3627395	3632676	This game was supposed to come out, and now it finally has a release date.
3632776	3635557	That's right, it was published in the latest Game Informer magazine.
3636057	3642279	May 3rd, 2011, or 2011, whatever you want to say, is the new release date for Duke Nukem Forever.
3642819	3645039	That is what Gearbox Software is aiming for.
3645980	3648460	You know, of course, obviously, they're really hyping up this release now.
3648500	3650561	It's like the game that was never going to happen.
3652367	3656930	Honestly, guys, once this game kind of changed hands, it's happened pretty quickly.
3656990	3662534	And I think it's not surprising that really all it took was getting it away from 3D Realms and giving it to someone else.
3663394	3666557	Hopefully, I mean, I don't mean to disrespect 3D Realms, but damn.
3666657	3667417	Did you see the trailer?
3667437	3668338	You never did anything.
3668438	3669158	Did you see the trailer?
3669258	3670699	Actually, I didn't see the full trailer.
3670839	3671440	It's funny.
3671660	3673081	So, well, let me take a look here.
3673201	3674902	It's just, when's your birthday?
3674922	3675763	When's your birthday?
3675843	3679885	I'm going to say I was born in 1931 because that's where my mouse clicked first.
3680186	3680626	February 1st, 1931.
3680666	3680926	Here we go.
3682768	3683408	Fresh and white.
3683748	3685030	Try mine.
3685150	3687032	Don't show me these goddamn ads.
3687052	3688573	Just go to Kotaku.
3688633	3689033	Seriously.
3689994	3692577	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
3693518	3695079	It's gonna be done in a second anyway.
3698702	3699183	Okay, here we go.
3701745	3703347	Rated M. Of course.
3708755	3714481	They used to tell stories of a man who saved the world.
3714962	3718545	A man whose very presence sent aliens running back to their motherships.
3719787	3722489	A man who disappeared without a trace.
3724371	3727595	When the invaders came back, they came back angry.
3733112	3736193	They tore our planet apart, bit by bit.
3737173	3739093	But they made one mistake.
3740854	3742774	They shouldn't have gone after our women.
3744374	3744974	Damn it.
3745295	3748495	Why do they always take the hot ones?
3748515	3749175	You want it.
3750156	3750456	Nice.
3752516	3753716	The captions are the best part.
3755057	3756077	You need it.
3758917	3760598	Did he just punch that alien in the face?
3760758	3760998	Yes.
3761678	3761998	Awesome.
3765402	3773365	And now... We're fucking bringing it!
3776806	3777146	Nice.
3778046	3778386	What?
3782467	3784128	Did you think I was gone forever?
3788936	3790277	Did they get the original voice actor?
3790297	3792758	Sounds like it.
3792858	3796379	This is a big giant alien with three boobs.
3805644	3807244	He's peeing.
3807484	3808105	That's lovely.
3809545	3810146	That's nice.
3811306	3812987	That's going on for way too long in this trailer.
3813667	3814908	That'll be done soon.
3816188	3816549	Really?
3819659	3820379	Oh, a lot of gum.
3820499	3821540	Nice.
3821660	3822420	I like the vehicle drive.
3822460	3823021	I think it's cool.
3823081	3827523	It should be good, because this guy just did Borderlands.
3827543	3827703	Yeah.
3838566	3839726	Coochie, coochie.
3841667	3844469	Hail to the king, baby.
3844549	3845830	What about the game, Duke?
3846050	3847150	Was it any good?
3847350	3850472	Yeah, but after 12 years, it should be.
3853033	3853373	Nice.
3853734	3854234	Very cute.
3854634	3857976	The minute I heard it was going to the guys in Borderlands, I was like, okay, it's in capable hands.
3858936	3885622	I'm curious to see how the game plays like a first level walkthrough type of video or something which I'm sure probably exists out there from the Penny Arcade Expo where they brought it but yeah it looks like it's keeping that same sense of humor and definitely not holding back on the tits and ass that's nice to see I remember reading that everything that's in the that's blurred out or bleeped out is actually going to be in the game so nice
3886926	3887286	Very nice.
3888166	3891968	Let's see, our chat room is oversharing as they're watching this trailer here with us.
3892368	3895369	Ed Seaton Beaver in our chat room says, I am touching myself to the trailer.
3897050	3900611	Defective Candy says, I have quite literally been waiting for this game my whole life.
3902765	3906286	Bonds006 says, punching it in the face never gets old.
3906946	3907526	That's right.
3908547	3909507	Or is it punching E.T.?
3909647	3911227	It's not Scott Pilgrim.
3911387	3913188	It's Prodigy, okay?
3914208	3915308	It's the Prodigy.
3915989	3917109	Not Scott Pilgrim.
3917369	3920870	Yes, it was in that trailer, but it's the Prodigy.
3921290	3924231	There's also a cage match pick that won a couple times.
3924511	3924791	That's right.
3925151	3926733	Alright, let's get into the classic game of the week.
3926773	3929335	Enough about this stuff that you had to wait 14 years for.
3929755	3931657	How about something that was out 14 years ago?
3931677	3932398	I think it's 12 years.
3932698	3933018	Whatever.
3933038	3933859	He said 12 years.
3933939	3935280	I'm going by Duke.
3935360	3935621	Fine.
3935901	3936441	How about we say 13?
3938883	3939264	Shut up.
3939384	3941506	Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week.
3943788	3944368	Fine.
3944468	3946090	Excite me with a classic game.
3947051	3949273	The classic game of the week is Power Stone 2.
3950194	3951315	Specifically Power Stone 2.
3952585	3958608	Power Stone was great, but Power Stone 2 made all kinds of fun improvements over the first one.
3959148	3964171	So first of all, it's got all of the characters from the first Power Stone, and it's basically a four-player fighting game.
3965511	3965651	And...
3967472	3968453	It's just so much fun.
3969033	3970614	You have all kinds of different gameplay.
3970634	3973816	You've got the one-on-one, which is like the original.
3974036	3976257	It's a two-character storyline game.
3976677	3981880	You have arcade mode, which is a four-character storyline game, and two characters advance per round.
3982221	3986403	Then you have original, which is multiplayer, so you can pick stages and everything.
3986443	3987464	It's a fun party game.
3988084	3993207	And then adventure that has an unpredictable storyline, and you can collect cards, items, and money.
3994443	3997424	So yeah, it's got five different stages and the boss stages.
3998244	4000585	And all kinds of different fun stuff.
4000645	4003146	You've got the desert stage that has the Pharaoh Walker.
4005027	4006607	And all kinds of neat things.
4006707	4010669	It even had secret characters like Pride Falcon and Mel.
4011489	4015511	And in the PSP version you also get Kraken and Valgus back from the first game.
4015731	4016491	So that was pretty cool.
4016811	4018332	I like Jack.
4019172	4019812	Jack was cool.
4020512	4020792	Although...
4022874	4029060	I think for Dan he was always using Fokker, or as they had him in the US one, Falcon.
4030161	4032824	But, you know, because Fokker's like Roy Fokker from Macross.
4033004	4034005	That's what he always said.
4034726	4035907	Or he's a real mother Fokker.
4037288	4038409	I would always use Ayame.
4038990	4039370	That was me.
4040351	4041732	www.DarkSakura.com
4060527	4066651	You can get different items like flamethrowers and giant hammers and bear traps and a magazine.
4067471	4072554	And, you know, you get food and invisibility and wings and all kinds of fun stuff.
4073094	4076316	And you can, you know, drop bombs and icebergs at people.
4077036	4078697	So, really cool.
4078717	4082519	But you've got, like, the bad guys with, like I said, Pharaoh Walker and Dr. Erode.
4082860	4084120	Because Dr. Erode is cool.
4084481	4088083	And he has a Power Stone of his own.
4089073	4089893	Thanks for watching!
4107181	4125029	and actually the secret character Mel ran the item shop and with the VMU it had this thing called the mini book that you can look at your players item inventory you can trade items with other players and you can register things in your inventory as handy items that appear in original mode so they give you this advantage
4125729	4142542	and if you put the disc in a CD player then it plays the same message well, it plays the same message that was used on the Dreamcast one except there's piano music with it and that's Power Stone 2 awesome Dreamcast
4143070	4143831	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4165939	4166860	with eight players.
4167420	4168040	Absolutely.
4168581	4171543	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Power Stone 2.
4171983	4172943	Good choice, DarkSakura.
4173224	4173864	Very good choice.
4174504	4175985	All right, we're going to go to a break, guys.
4176065	4177366	It's that time of the show where we take a break.
4177446	4178067	We'll be back, though.
4178087	4179567	There's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
4179608	4183350	We haven't even talked about some of the things that were announced at the Square Enix event this week, which we're going to get into.
4183750	4186072	A little more news about Duke Nukem Forever, believe it or not.
4186432	4189514	A story about the Rock Band Network and some things going on with Apple.
4189774	4190975	And we have to talk about...
4191815	4193416	What's going on with the PlayStation hack case?
4193436	4194297	Because there's more developments.
4194317	4197239	We'll get into all that, plus a story involving boobs.
4197379	4199040	And it's not even a Yogi Bear related thing.
4199361	4200882	We've got all that after the break.
4200962	4207647	We'll be right back with your Twitter topics, emails, or lack thereof, and more in just a little bit here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4213550	4215991	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4216031	4224055	We are live on this Sunday, January 23rd of 2011 for the 398th episode of our little program.
4224695	4226116	And we've got plenty more news coming up.
4226336	4230678	Some rapid fire news in just a moment, but we quickly want to give some plugs for some other shows that we work on.
4231518	4233679	Every week, DarkSakura has a show that she does.
4234239	4234459	Yes.
4234479	4235120	With her buddies.
4235560	4236680	Comic Insanity.
4236820	4238681	And you can find it on Infamous.net.
4238701	4240202	That's N-F-A-M-O-U-S.
4240382	4242203	And we have a Twitter for Comic Insanity as well.
4242952	4243933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4259313	4259814	Check those out.
4260334	4261415	Both available on iTunes.
4261455	4265639	Comic Insanity, that's the letter N, no I in front, and Horde House.
4265820	4269663	You can find those both on iTunes or whatever podcasting directory it is that you use.
4270324	4271565	Let's get into some rapid fire news.
4271665	4272666	Then the Twitter topics.
4272726	4274348	You got just a couple minutes to lock those in.
4274368	4277191	Twitter.com slash OLR for the Twitter topics.
4277811	4278572	First, some quick news.
4279099	4288123	Yes, there's a rumor that an official software development kit for Windows is coming before the Kinect.
4288823	4291724	And they're saying it could actually be coming within the next few months.
4292404	4297086	Which, if you think about it, would time just perfectly with Game Developer Conference.
4297126	4301148	And wouldn't that be something that they would probably want at Game Developer Conference?
4302008	4302188	Huh?
4302408	4302648	Maybe?
4303008	4303469	A little bit?
4303609	4304009	Good theory.
4304729	4324029	It says, apparently, this is coming from a website WinRumors, sources are familiar with the plans, and that official software development kit and Kinect drivers are being prepped for a beta release in the coming months.
4324509	4330175	Potentially arriving with the upcoming XNA update dubbed Community Technical Preview.
4330856	4344731	In the report, I guess they're saying that there's statements being made by Microsoft's head, Steve Ballmer, earlier this month saying that the Kinect support would be coming to PC in a formal way in the right time.
4345892	4349213	It makes sense that it would be at something like Game Developers Conference.
4349853	4351913	My bet would be that's when it's coming out.
4352213	4355354	You'll probably see an update to XNA and stuff like that around that time as well.
4358235	4366236	It's good anyways because you get support for the XNA stuff, for PC stuff, and for the indie games.
4366776	4368737	I'd really like to see what the indie games do with Kinect.
4368757	4369877	It'd be very interesting.
4372322	4373503	and Scary at the same time.
4373523	4375144	Yes, it could be very scary as well.
4375945	4376225	True.
4378426	4379807	Yeah.
4379908	4382790	Pixel 4's Halo is now free to download.
4383130	4390175	This is the Halo demake by Eric Ruth, who you may remember ran into a little bit of trouble with his last...
4390595	4418390	DMake of DJ Hero but this time though it's kind of a side scroller shooter game so go check it out and you can find that on I guess bigdownload.com slash games slash pixel dash force dash halo slash pc slash pixel dash force dot halo dot dash free dash game or just go do a damn google search for it because it's probably a lot easier than writing that all down
4420519	4448520	and last but not least, speaking of DJ Hero DJ Hero 2 has added some new trance anthems this week and you can get these for $8 or 640 Microsoft points and they are also available separately on the Wii for 300 points a pop and with that you get Foreign Angel by Paul Van Dyke mixed with 9pm Till I Come by ATB
4450512	4476484	Which even though that song I don't really consider like a trance anthem I do remember that it was on a bunch And apparently that song is remixed as well, my bad It was on a bunch of trance albums back when I was buying CDs a long time ago Not Over by Paul Oakenfold featuring Ryan Tedder And Punk by Ferry Corson versus Imagine by Armin Van Buren Sounds cool
4477833	4479535	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4499973	4500113	Yeah.
4500133	4500213	Yeah.
4500233	4500373	Yeah.
4520918	4533530	There will be a number of RPG elements in this, meaning there'll be different job classes, there'll be PvP, you can party up with other players, and of course, hack hack slash slash and all the button mashing you are used to from the originals.
4534330	4537653	It will be a free-to-play game, so that's pretty cool.
4537874	4540496	Microtransactions, of course, that's how these things work these days.
4541517	4546041	No word on when this game will announce in North America, if at all possible.
4546261	4548662	Obviously, this is going to be another country's first.
4549783	4550183	There you go.
4551903	4552364	Portal 2.
4553364	4554765	Big news on Portal 2 this week.
4555165	4561848	Portal 2 has announced that when it comes to the PS3, it's going to have cross-platform chat between the PS3 and the PC.
4562228	4563969	That includes multiplayer as well.
4564369	4566410	And, get this, you buy the game on the PS3...
4567330	4591264	you're going to get the Steam version for free if you link your PSN and your Steam accounts you will get the Steam Play version of Portal 2 free because you have the PS3 game so boy did they just sell many more copies of the PlayStation 3 version of this game at least versus the Xbox 360 which is really what Sony wanted at their conference I'm sure when they came out and announced this whole new friendship they now have with Valve
4591804	4619397	so they are also saying with this a quote from Gabe Newell from Valve quote we hope to expand upon the foundation being laid in Portal 2 with more Steam features and functionality in DLC and future content releases could be very interesting for the future these two companies working together by the way cloud based storage will also be working on the PS3 which I think they had announced before but it's kind of interesting to see how that's all going to work with the PC integration as well
4621039	4623121	One other quick story here, and I mean quick.
4624882	4626864	You know there's a new Justin Bieber movie coming out?
4626884	4628025	Yeah, I know, right?
4628846	4632229	Think of how I felt when I had to see that trailer before I went and saw Tangled.
4634571	4635432	Well, you know what?
4635472	4640676	You gotta give Nintendo props, because they wanted to use a 15-second clip of the Super Mario Bros.
4640716	4644439	theme song in the new Justin Bieber movie, and Nintendo said no.
4646519	4647360	Nintendo said no.
4648482	4650565	Because cereal's more important.
4650765	4656013	Yes, funny enough, I remember back in the day there was Nintendo underwear you could order from the magazine.
4656614	4658577	And you think of how bad of an idea that was?
4659038	4659759	This is much worse.
4659859	4660360	Yeah, that's right.
4660580	4661502	It's like underoos.
4662843	4675995	Yes, we may have made a failing cereal brand and we may have whored out our brands to all sorts of different merchandise out there, but no, we are drawing the line here.
4676015	4677076	Fuck off, Justin Bieber.
4679232	4679492	DarkSakura
4700180	4711070	Well, for fans of Bejeweled Blitz, it looks like Bejeweled Blitz Live is going to have a 16-player online play with Xbox Live Arcade.
4711450	4712891	So that's pretty cool.
4713111	4714172	Lots of people can play.
4714392	4715593	It's going to be crazy, GoNuts.
4716874	4720576	And Dance Dance Revolution is having download content!
4721096	4722076	Yay!
4722737	4737123	There's a Greatest Hits pack that's got Paranoia, Brilliant to You, AM3P, Trip Machine, Put Your Faith in Me And there's a premium pack that's free that says Let's Get Away, Dreaming Can Make a Wish Come True, and Private Eye
4738304	4740265	and just a whole bunch of stuff.
4740305	4741446	There's a lot of stuff on here.
4741466	4746669	There's a Konomics Greatest Hits, which has a B4U Higher Burn in the Floor Hysteria Trip Machine.
4747690	4748210	Really cool.
4749331	4751512	I think that these are worthy packets.
4752513	4753654	So, hoorah.
4754714	4763020	And also, there is video out that has two more characters for a...
4764000	4764440	Excuse me.
4765581	4771445	For Super Street Fighter 4, there is Evil Ryu and Oni Akuma.
4772065	4774887	So that's pretty cool, which I kind of saw coming anyway.
4776308	4776948	Looking forward to that.
4776988	4777909	Yeah, there's video out.
4777929	4780851	It hasn't been officially confirmed, but dude, there's video, so whatever.
4781711	4783292	He's got red glowing eyes.
4783432	4784233	It's Evil Ryu.
4785419	4787501	They have some better screenshots out there too.
4787821	4789162	Yeah, like that.
4789843	4792365	Yeah, it's official.
4793246	4794267	As official as it gets.
4794727	4802554	And his moves are the same ones that he had in Alpha 2 and Alpha 3, so whatever.
4804536	4806318	See, this is what it's about.
4806738	4807519	Arcade Unlocks.
4808174	4808854	I love that shit.
4809415	4811896	I love that shit when it was around with DDR Max 2.
4812456	4815838	It got people, got asses in the seats, as they would say.
4816678	4817659	Got people to the arcade.
4818199	4819400	Well, fans of DDR.
4819920	4823342	I'm sure people that play Street Fighter don't give a shit about DDR.
4824542	4826503	But that's what they need to do.
4826723	4828344	That's pretty badass.
4830125	4831406	Are we ready to get to the tweets?
4832126	4833667	It looks like actually they're just calling him Oni.
4834367	4835048	I'll take that as a no.
4836741	4839605	which kind of makes sense because anyway.
4839926	4840847	Okay, we have tweets.
4842089	4842450	No, I know.
4842470	4846576	I remember when Oni Mode and DDR was a big deal and everybody was like, what does Oni mean?
4846596	4847537	Oni means ogre.
4847777	4848258	Oh, ogre.
4848839	4849720	So, all right.
4850602	4851463	Now let's get to the tweets.
4852524	4852984	Tweet, tweet.
4853245	4856907	Every week we invite you guys to show us your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
4857367	4859669	It'll invoke some discussion here on our lovely program.
4859809	4862751	You guys sent quite a few tweets tonight, so we'll start it off with Red Entertainment.
4864092	4867414	Jumping ahead a little bit here, but I'll go ahead since most people know about this already.
4867814	4869095	Final Fantasy XIII 2.
4870016	4873918	Shouldn't they be putting their attention towards fixing the fuck up that is Final Fantasy XIV?
4874759	4876260	Yes, but that's going to take some time.
4876380	4876820	Seriously?
4876920	4879222	Final Fantasy XIV relaunch in the US?
4879822	4881003	At least Christmas.
4881624	4882164	If not later.
4882324	4883526	Thanks for watching!
4895592	4914829	It's true Alright, let's see Spazinator, PSM There are rumors that an MGS HD collection is in the works A Metal Gear Solid HD collection I wouldn't be surprised We've got two already coming out in March We've got the Tomb Raider and the Prince of Persia Ah, good point
4915905	4917487	And they just had the Sly Collection.
4918107	4920629	It's popular nowadays.
4920649	4924632	Moving on to another tweet from Spazinator, kind of keeping us up to date on the video releases.
4925032	4932618	The pilots to Being Human, Perfect Couples, and Fairly Legal are free on Xbox Live, while Perfect Couples and Fairly Legal are free on PlayStation Network.
4933018	4936681	If you like to sample new TV shows or whatever.
4936821	4938142	I have a problem with Being Human.
4940087	4940727	What is that show?
4940867	4944911	Okay, I've watched the first two seasons of it on BBC America.
4945651	4948774	It's a show about... No, it's not a comedy.
4949174	4950055	No, a copy show.
4950495	4954399	Yeah, it's about a vampire, a ghost, and a werewolf that live in the same flat.
4954679	4955760	Sounds like the beginning of a joke.
4956240	4960264	I've said the same thing, but it's actually a really good show, at least the British one is.
4960544	4962465	I've heard the American one is not so good.
4963689	4964249	Thanks for watching!
4982421	4982721	I don't know.
4983201	4983901	There's this show.
4983921	4985842	I don't know how far do I want to get into this.
4985902	4987342	Have you heard about that Skins show?
4987762	4989723	It's big in the UK.
4989743	4990883	They made it here on MTV.
4991143	4992563	I have zero interest in that show.
4992783	4993323	Zero.
4993483	4996404	Actually, if there's a number less than zero, I have that amount of interest.
4996444	4997204	Negative Infinity?
4997404	4999665	Negative Infinity is my interest level for that.
5001345	5004866	But I can't get away from it on my entertainment gossip websites, which pisses me off.
5005906	5006926	ActDeft sends us a tweet.
5006966	5008807	Hey, it's about the PSP 2.
5009187	5009847	A little rumor.
5011984	5027388	3G connectivity and a very fancy screen on the PSP2 if this tweet from Actdeft is to be believed where he links us to a story on Kotaku apparently it's a report from Nikkei that the portable in Japan will be on the NTT Dokomo network via 3G
5029749	5034991	Could that mean like this is going to be like T-Mobile's answer to the iPhone?
5035071	5035512	Or I don't know.
5035532	5036592	I'm pulling that out of my ass.
5036612	5040474	But one of the providers that doesn't have the iPhone, maybe they'll have the PSP2.
5040994	5041454	Interesting.
5041814	5043035	They're not saying anything about phone.
5043435	5045075	Just 3G connection.
5045396	5046216	Kind of like an iPad.
5047648	5050529	That would be interesting because that means you could play multiplayer anywhere you go.
5051350	5054251	What would you think about 3G on the PSP2?
5054291	5055291	Would that be cool for you, Loki?
5055511	5056012	Would you like that?
5066636	5068057	That's the killer right there.
5068397	5074861	I mean, unless it's included in the price of that system, it's going to be fucking expensive.
5075502	5081986	Because you're going to have to pay another $100 a month or $60 a month to play your stupid system.
5083106	5083827	Wi-Fi, no.
5084087	5084447	No thanks.
5085788	5091612	But then again, if I can do it via Wi-Fi, that's fine.
5091632	5092772	I'll just tether to my phone.
5093353	5093553	Okay.
5094488	5096588	All right, Sterlok sends us a tweet.
5096649	5098189	Crimson Echoes finally leaked.
5098309	5100089	Suck it, Square, and then links us to the story.
5100109	5101330	And I was like, what's Crimson Echoes?
5101810	5104150	Oh, yes, it's the fan-made Chrono Trigger sequel.
5104570	5110292	So the fan-made Chrono Trigger sequel finally leaked out to the internet, which we all knew it would.
5110352	5112452	This is the one that Square Enix shut down not that long ago.
5112932	5113432	We all knew it.
5113552	5114733	Once it hits the internet, it's out.
5114953	5116033	And sure enough, that's what happened.
5116693	5143078	Crimson Echoes made its way out apparently also a game called Flames of Eternity got leaked which was I guess a branch off of the same title so there you go by the way I'm looking at the fighting in this game it looks like Final Fantasy 6 kind of interesting maybe it's like a really elaborate ROM hack or something I don't know alright let's move on to defective candy I like this send us a tweet connect hacked for surgical robot
5146203	5157359	a group of graduate students at the University of Washington have modified the firmware and software of the Kinect to guide the actions of surgical robots wow
5159585	5162386	And it gets into more of the details of this.
5162426	5163527	I'm looking for some quotes here.
5163887	5165367	I'm just seeing this story for the first time.
5166108	5169989	The hacked unit adds the sense of touch and feeds information to the surgeon.
5170429	5175231	The setup could save $50,000 on the standard rig used to perform non-invasive surgery.
5176352	5179833	We could define basically a force field around, say, a liver.
5180233	5185195	If the surgeon got too close, he would run into that force field and it would protect the object he didn't want to cut.
5185755	5186456	That's weird.
5187489	5190071	But then, what about the day the machines take over?
5191792	5193614	Do you really want a machine operating on you?
5194455	5195115	Cyberdyne!
5195575	5196796	Exactly, Skynet.
5198338	5200159	A couple tweets from Tigerclaw.
5202403	5231847	Telltale Games strongly hints at doing The Walking Dead game I guess really the title says it all but we're linked to a story there The Walking Dead is a show on AMC and it was a comic book series that now is this big TV show I know a few people that are into this I haven't watched this but apparently Telltale Games is hinting that perhaps they're doing something on this and that was well Telltale's got a big event going on they're going to be talking about five new multi-platform efforts and I'm assuming Jurassic Park of course is one of those
5232627	5242192	They're also saying one of the titles announced is based on a just-launched property from the TV and comic book world whose popularity is changing life as some know it.
5242692	5244533	So some people are inferring that from that.
5244953	5246094	Sounds like we'll find out in a month.
5247214	5247794	Could be interesting.
5248475	5250176	MNZiba sends us a couple tweets as well.
5250576	5255318	The Kinect hacker that made himself into a bunch of Minecraft monuments has now put those monuments in motion.
5255438	5256379	Weren't you saying something about this?
5257179	5259140	It was during the break or right at the end of Part A. I don't remember.
5259548	5264372	No, I was just saying that we were talking about this a couple weeks ago.
5264632	5265012	Oh, was it?
5265733	5266293	Well, there you go.
5266353	5270216	Apparently, this is a Minecraft monument where now it moves.
5270617	5272258	I still have never played Minecraft.
5272278	5273359	Does that make me a bad gamer?
5273759	5274260	Or just lazy?
5274280	5275461	Nope, I haven't done it either.
5275661	5275921	Weird.
5277256	5281558	Yeah, apparently the Minecraft monument moves at 30 frames a second while he juggles three balls.
5281918	5285860	Which, I mean, I guess if you had to kind of create this, like, bit by bit, it's probably a pain in the ass.
5285880	5286641	You know what's better, though?
5286781	5286961	What?
5287741	5289782	It's the one that they have where it's a cat chasing a laser.
5291843	5293984	MNZiba also sends us a tweet about this.
5294345	5298307	A letter from the Final Fantasy XIV producer explaining upcoming huge changes.
5298707	5300107	And it's a very long read.
5300147	5302449	And this was just produced a little bit this week.
5303409	5304830	They actually did some polls...
5305370	5309072	This is really long, so I might have to read this while someone else is doing a story.
5309632	5314234	But yeah, it looks like they really took this poll and kind of like took some of the feedback to heart.
5314975	5316796	So what are they talking about?
5317176	5329302	Tutorials for new players, quests revolving around the danger facing the world, public company quests, improvements to the log, improvements of dialogue windows, character jump feature.
5330823	5331403	Interesting.
5333089	5357542	Guildlevs so yeah they want to do a whole bunch of new shit in the game we'll just leave it at that there's a long letter available lodestone.finalfantasyxiv the roman way of saying 14.com that's where you can find that last couple tweets here another one from TigerClaw saying consumer group reporting Activision to UK fair trade office over Black Ops glitches and this is a link to a story on Gamasutra
5358943	5361104	It's a British consumer group, The Gamer's Voice.
5361464	5368848	They're going to complain to the UK Office of Fair Trading about the performance issues in the PS3 and PC versions of Call of Duty Black Ops.
5369668	5380193	I guess the publisher did not respond to an open letter from the group one month ago, which talked about the freezing and online multiplayer login, that the game is not functioning as intended or advertised.
5380673	5383775	So I guess you could say it's kind of like the Better Business Bureau in a way.
5385015	5385456	Interesting.
5386796	5389317	So, somebody's going to take him to task over that one.
5389357	5389677	I don't know.
5389717	5391638	These things usually don't end up in much.
5391838	5394459	Usually like either a settlement or a letter or something.
5394479	5394779	I don't know.
5394819	5396579	But it'll be interesting to see what happens overseas.
5397380	5400080	One last tweet from Alex P. Carson on Twitter.
5401721	5402302	Thank you for watching!
5419005	5419305	DarkSakura.com
5445260	5446663	You know, maybe this isn't the show for them.
5447344	5449308	Maybe they need to subscribe to a sex podcast.
5449388	5450390	Woohoo!
5450911	5452233	But we always appreciate any efforts.
5452534	5453075	Absolutely.
5453696	5455158	And I'll even read your Twitter name on there.
5455178	5455559	There you go.
5456681	5457042	Alright!
5458723	5460784	Let's move on to some more gaming news.
5488824	5491312	and stuff like that I remember talking about that last week yeah
5492233	5504038	Because according to the judge, it says if having a PayPal account were enough, then there would be personal jurisdiction in this court over everybody, and that can't be right.
5504838	5510801	And it says the case is pending further discussion over jurisdiction, a decision Sony is likely to frown upon.
5512642	5519885	And now, seeing as how the hack is completely available online, and as I mentioned earlier...
5522210	5522831	and so on.
5550370	5552231	Yeah, I don't know.
5552791	5553872	It's going to be an interesting case.
5556493	5559915	Yeah, the story's going to come up every damn week until they settle.
5560275	5560696	Exactly.
5561536	5562377	I don't think they'll settle either.
5562397	5566239	And then you have companies using the whole PS3 hacking thing as an excuse.
5566999	5572282	According to Infinity Ward, I'm assuming this is what's left of Infinity Ward...
5573262	5580185	Modern Warfare 2 has been kind of made unplayable thanks to people hacking the game.
5580686	5582767	It says Infinity Ward cannot patch a fix.
5584447	5586508	People are saying it's making total shambles.
5586929	5587809	It's unplayable.
5590330	5595614	According to Infinity Wars, these games rely on security of the encryption on the platforms they're played on.
5597035	5603961	Unless the security exploit itself is resolved on the platform, updates to the game through patches will not resolve the problem.
5604461	5608625	At this time, we do not have any ability to restore or adjust individual stats.
5609345	5615430	We are looking at every option to help us help any user affected and
5618820	5619901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5637541	5638642	and they've been doing that.
5639262	5643986	So this is totally unrelated to anything that has to do with those PS3 keys.
5644646	5647929	And on top of that, they're doing the same thing on the 360.
5647969	5652772	They're hacking save files and stuff and that stuff's kind of been patched.
5654093	5657395	So it really comes down to they just don't want to fix it.
5658676	5660277	And if you think about it, why would they?
5660458	5661038	Modern Warfare 2?
5661418	5661979	Eh, whatever.
5662119	5662839	So it goes to shit.
5662979	5663620	Buy Black Ops.
5668344	5676688	I don't know Interesting There's no way to just track down who's fucking up the game and just ban them?
5676768	5690374	Maybe they could but they could just create another account I guess They'd have to actually track down systems Interesting Sorry about that, you cut off there in the beginning So wouldn't that go back to the laziness factor?
5691074	5692795	I think so Yep
5693601	5694841	And here's the thing, though.
5694881	5696342	People aren't actually reading into this.
5696382	5700183	They're kind of saying, oh, well, thanks, Geohot, for doing all this.
5700503	5702323	Now Modern Warfare 2 is unplayable.
5702583	5711746	Yes, if you're going to believe everybody and what they say and without doing actual research into what's going on, then sure, go ahead and blame those hackers.
5711846	5712666	But it is a different...
5713746	5715888	It's a special kind of hacker out there.
5715988	5725112	It's the little kid that figures out, oh hey, I can grief somebody this way or I can cheat in this game and screw it up for everybody.
5725153	5730335	It's just like the whole Grand Theft Auto hacking or modding community.
5730395	5739920	There's people that actually want to make stuff that's kind of cool and then there's people that want to make cars that freeze people or guns that freeze people's games because they're douchebags and that's what they do.
5741361	5745184	So, no matter what you do, those douchebags will find a way to be a douche.
5745464	5747425	Play with your friends and nobody else.
5747845	5748285	Exactly.
5748305	5751287	That's sadly where some of this is going, honestly, online.
5751307	5753289	If you want to play a legitimate game, you've got to play with your friends.
5753329	5754449	Take your ball and go home.
5756070	5761794	All right, some news coming out of Square Enix this week, involving a tweet a little bit ago, kind of references.
5762154	5764335	Final Fantasy XIII 2 was announced.
5764395	5766697	It is coming out for the 360 and the PlayStation 3.
5767677	5770119	It was during a little press event that Square Enix had this week.
5770479	5771240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5785976	5793043	Now, they are saying that Final Fantasy XIII 2 is set to launch in Japan in 2011, but that's probably just Japan.
5793264	5794665	They're not saying anything about the U.S.
5794945	5795526	just yet.
5796487	5797528	Oh no, they said next winter.
5797688	5798169	I'm sorry about that.
5798189	5799510	They said next winter is the release.
5799911	5802934	Does that mean next February or next December?
5804134	5805755	Because you can kind of take that a couple ways.
5805835	5807055	Hopefully it's a quick cycle.
5807495	5810816	I mean, I'm assuming this is just going to be done in the same engine as the first game was.
5811837	5813257	But just, you know, new story.
5814057	5815958	Some new models and all that stuff.
5816478	5818478	Hopefully more Dresh Sphere, right?
5819319	5819659	Yay.
5821641	5822202	Okay, maybe not.
5823042	5826165	The name of Final Fantasy Agito 13 has been changed.
5826225	5832530	It's now Final Fantasy Type 0, which would explain some of the stories in the past couple weeks about these trademarks showing up.
5832970	5836753	Final Fantasy Type 0 is the game that is coming out instead.
5837574	5846722	It is going to be on the PSP, of course, and they just said that this title just seems to be more appropriate because this is a more action-oriented design of the game.
5847462	5848023	And there you go.
5848063	5849244	It's going to be coming out to the PSP.
5850204	5873313	30 voice characters in the game, multiplayer supposedly in it as well nothing announced just yet for what's going on in North America but it is coming out to Japan this summer on two UMDs not one but two that must be a big game we'll see well how about going back to something that we touched on earlier
5873891	5874231	Yay!
5874371	5875491	It's like a blast from the past.
5875591	5875851	Yes.
5876711	5877792	Duke Nukem Forever.
5878432	5878952	Yay.
5879192	5880412	Is there going to be download content?
5881012	5881272	Is there?
5881392	5883013	Huh, huh, huh, huh?
5883173	5883633	Probably.
5884213	5894855	Well, they haven't announced anything about it, but they are saying that they are trying to, and this is a quote, on making possible the un-possible, shipping Duke Nukem Forever.
5896135	5901876	But they are saying that there could be some download content that they are keeping the future in mind.
5903116	5903276	So...
5904915	5905635	I'm sure there will be.
5905775	5907576	Build your own strip club DLC.
5907996	5908576	Yay!
5908756	5910096	I want voice macros to come back.
5910876	5911337	I'll be nice.
5911837	5913617	I wouldn't be surprised if they have DLC.
5913677	5917678	I mean, look at the awesome DLC they had for the original Duke Nukem 3D.
5917918	5921939	They have the fourth episode, the Atomic Edition, which is just awesome.
5922219	5923459	I love the supermarket level.
5923839	5928141	I love the level that was kind of Disneyland, but not, you know, with the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and stuff.
5929601	5929981	Awesome.
5931061	5932842	I just miss Duke Nukem Deathmatch.
5933802	5934382	That was awesome.
5935948	5938350	I hope this game is as awesome as the old Duke Nukem was.
5938430	5938990	I really do.
5939311	5940151	It looks pretty neat.
5940452	5940792	It does.
5941052	5941352	It does.
5942293	5948278	The trailer's sense of humor is any indication, but how often do games look cool and they suck?
5948338	5949959	Just as irreverent as the original.
5952956	5964866	There's some developers out there developing for the iOS platform that are pissed off at Apple because they just don't take piracy or theft seriously.
5967048	5970711	Theft in this case happens to be a game called The Blocks Cometh.
5971232	5975976	It's an iPhone game that's out there right now that's completely ripped off of a Flash game.
5976556	5977817	It didn't just copy the game.
5978037	5978757	They took the name.
5979057	5981599	They took the assets, the music, everything.
5981679	5982619	They ported it over.
5983880	5986341	Unfortunately, it's not by the creators.
5986501	5987682	It's by somebody else.
5988602	5993705	And the creators of the actual game actually have a version for the iPhone that's in the works right now.
5994565	5995365	But they're pissed off.
5995466	6005711	They contacted Apple and their customer service or whomever said their legal departments contacted the people responsible for it.
6006171	6007872	And they've kind of given them the runaround.
6009093	6013515	But there's nothing really that they seem to be doing.
6014056	6018298	And I guess it's kind of a serious case if you think about it.
6018358	6023961	It's not just, oh, this game is sort of like Angry Birds or this game is sort of like something else.
6025501	6028783	We took this game, stole everything from it, and threw it on there.
6028943	6030443	Like if I created Super Mario Bros.
6030483	6036845	and popped it onto the iOS, Apple's app store and stuff like that.
6037345	6038026	Well, could you?
6038386	6041187	I mean, if this game gets by, why hasn't someone done that yet?
6041927	6042847	Maybe they need to.
6044248	6046108	Super Mario Bros.
6047429	6048769	or Great Giana Sisters.
6048889	6049289	I don't know.
6049349	6049810	Take your pick.
6051980	6052861	The What's Hot Section
6067953	6070154	I have a feeling a lot of that runs on an algorithm though.
6070194	6075678	I don't think that they necessarily specifically targeted that game to promote.
6075758	6076338	I think you're right.
6076358	6077619	It's probably getting a lot of downloads.
6077899	6081461	It's probably been getting a lot of downloads because of the coverage, honestly.
6081921	6082141	Yeah.
6082241	6083162	Is it a pay game though?
6085983	6086924	Yes, it is a pay game.
6087264	6088045	Pay games aren't worth it.
6088405	6093708	By the way, Alpha Cananagram, I don't know if you saw this, he's following up in chat saying they have taken it down since then.
6094208	6095369	So it is no longer there.
6096902	6125755	but look at what it took for that to happen I think that's still fairly notable you know what I mean nobody saw that right away but of course if I'm working at Apple and I'm testing these apps am I going to recognize this game probably not you know they don't do the peer review thing like XNA does where lots of people are prone to recognize stuff that's ripped off but if it's just like a couple people at Apple I mean I would never recognize that this game was ripped off I'd never play the original so in that way I can kind of
6126476	6127457	I don't know.
6127477	6127898	Maybe.
6141141	6141501	We'll see.
6142322	6148886	Alright, so let's move on to another story that has to do with the Rock Band Network.
6150267	6151248	Woohoo, Rock Band!
6152729	6156092	Rock Band Network 2.0 is coming out in February!
6156832	6179801	February 15th is the date to be exact that's when the new track creation system will come out all songs currently being made for Rock Band Network they must be done by February 14th when 1.0 will be phased out and then everything after that for Rock Band Network 2 will require Rock Band 3 I'm assuming this means because of you know the keyboards and all that other stuff so there you go
6181181	6185364	By the way, Rock Band 3, sadly, not doing too well on the sales charts, did it?
6185784	6187365	It didn't do too well after Christmas, did it?
6188065	6188746	That's too bad.
6188806	6189426	Still awesome.
6189586	6190187	Still awesome.
6190807	6191227	I agree.
6192308	6194369	Maybe forcing people to upgrade will do some good.
6194429	6198792	Maybe they should just slash the price of the game to 20 bucks and watch it fly off shelves.
6199512	6201474	Hey, I have a friend that bought the pro guitar.
6202014	6202294	Oh, yeah?
6202434	6203695	Yeah, it's pretty heavy.
6204395	6205016	It's pretty cool, too.
6207874	6216317	Alright, so with that, I guess we're going to get into the mailbag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place where you send us emails every week.
6217717	6220318	So we're going to get into the mailbag.
6222478	6230841	Well, we actually, well, the mailbag kind of sucks because we've got nothing in it.
6232901	6233702	Read the spam!
6234863	6241027	Well, we don't have any spam either, so I dedicate this to everyone who did not send an email.
6242969	6246692	I'll take the box!
6246872	6247372	The box!
6247872	6249093	You took the box?
6250655	6252816	Let's see what's in the box!
6257920	6258701	Nothing!
6259641	6261443	Absolutely nothing!
6261463	6261603	Nothing!
6262790	6263711	Stupid!
6264091	6266292	You're so stupid!
6269114	6269375	Nice.
6270635	6270916	Yeah.
6273077	6275479	You know, that's the movie that Dan and I got engaged over.
6275599	6276620	I know, I remember that.
6277020	6277300	Yeah.
6278301	6280122	You want a drink from the fire hose.
6281183	6281703	You know what's funny?
6281883	6283564	Wheel of fish.
6283664	6285546	I don't think I've ever seen that movie from start to finish.
6286126	6286767	No, the best one.
6287167	6287787	Badgers!
6288408	6288968	Badgers!
6289368	6291210	We don't need no stinking badgers!
6291230	6291510	Badgers!
6293502	6295524	Weird Al needs to do another movie, don't you think?
6296225	6297006	He totally does.
6297426	6297727	All right.
6299468	6301290	Let's move on to the FUs of the week.
6301370	6303593	Oh, what an appropriate time to get into this segment.
6303633	6304874	Now, I know we have some of these.
6321099	6325702	F you to certain situations that are beyond my control that involve finances and my house.
6327943	6328223	Loki?
6329844	6334827	F you to the people at A&W for not knowing how to fill up a half gallon of root beer.
6335527	6345793	It was actually not to mention it is impossible to transport this without it spilling everywhere as it was and it made it very difficult to drive.
6345813	6348234	I will never be buying a half gallon root beer again.
6348634	6349435	It is just too much root beer.
6349475	6349715	A half
6349775	6350575	Thank you for watching!
6368161	6369302	Uh, my FU of the week.
6369682	6370503	I have to be vague.
6370783	6373585	There's actually a lot of stuff going on, but nothing I can talk about on my public show.
6373685	6374906	So, FU to stuff.
6375706	6376527	That's all stuff.
6377548	6378028	There you go.
6379189	6381350	So, let's get back to some gaming news.
6382231	6385053	And then skyblind in just a little bit after a couple more stories.
6385553	6386634	Loki, you need to cheer me up.
6386654	6388716	Do you have a story that might cheer me up?
6388736	6389456	Um, yes.
6389536	6393659	It's about the brand new, um, Yogi Bear movie.
6394139	6396041	No, I'm not cheered up.
6396081	6396421	Yeah.
6397081	6399722	No, it's about Tiger Woods and a weird glitch.
6399762	6401142	This really isn't cheering me up.
6401643	6408485	It's about a weird glitch that's being reported, I don't even know if we should take this seriously, by The Sun.
6409145	6411886	Yes, the tabloid magazine in the UK.
6412846	6428213	Um, apparently, there was a glitch that this one woman has, um, encountered Britt and Joe, um, Ile, or whatever, um, apparently, her avatar that she had set up on there one day, when she popped on the game, it was topless!
6429394	6430314	Oh, now you have my attention.
6430354	6430534	What?
6430574	6430874	What's this?
6430894	6431775	Nipples and everything.
6431955	6432175	What?
6432195	6440599	Yes, the, um, the avatar is topless, and, uh, of course, EA was quick to say that, um,
6442202	6446663	There is no possible way that that could have been done without some sort of hack.
6447863	6454005	But, as we've seen with games like Heavy Rain, I could believe that it could be done.
6455665	6460646	Granted, she doesn't actually have boob textures or whatever.
6460686	6468708	The nipple bumps are there for the clothing and stuff, but I think that just for some reason it's not drawing the clothing on.
6470766	6497755	but she's topless and playing golf boobies you know what you get those women topless and playing golf I bet you a lot more people Tiger Woods would sell like twice as many copies as it does now Tiger Woods the M rated golf game there you go well it just took a story about boobies to cheer me up a little bit Tiger Boobs I like that
6498410	6499331	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6515808	6517530	It's now coming back on the Xbox 360.
6518632	6521656	Judgment Silver Sword and the remix Cardinal Sins.
6522517	6523839	They are both going to be coming out.
6523899	6527003	I guess they're bonuses in a new 360 retail shmup.
6527744	6528926	Eshkatos?
6529447	6530809	I don't know if I'm saying that right.
6530909	6532291	Of course all these games are coming out in Japan.
6533332	6555292	there's two trailers for this game that are out there on the internet you can import it on March 24th I like this because I guess there's like one trailer here that shows like a split because you know how like vertical shmups on the 360 don't use much real estate on the screen at all like there's all this wasted horizontal space well in this game sorry it's a little loud sorry guys
6556043	6558666	It looks very pretty, I gotta say.
6559106	6561148	Like some of the effects they're doing and stuff.
6561408	6567694	But then there's one part of the trailer here where they're showing multiplayer in like three screens on the screen at once.
6568595	6569256	That's cool.
6571558	6572199	That's very cool.
6573920	6576062	And then they're dodging lots and lots of bullets.
6577103	6577444	And dying.
6578789	6585513	WonderSwan Color shoot-em-ups making a return on the 360, but only in Japan, which makes sense because WonderSwan Color was only out in Japan, never came out here.
6585593	6586874	It was such a good system, too.
6587935	6589396	Our Skype line is now open.
6589436	6595880	You can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
6596000	6597160	You can go ahead and give us a call.
6597421	6599122	We'll talk about whatever it is you want to talk about.
6599722	6601843	In the meantime, should we see if there's any last-minute stories?
6601863	6606026	Because I know it takes about a minute until the folks that are listening hear us begging for calls.
6606428	6613394	There's a rumor, uh, well, we talked a little bit about this, the 3G and stuff, and the OLD screen, uh, PSP2, already, I'm assuming.
6613515	6615016	That was in Twitter topics, now that I think of it.
6615136	6615296	Yep.
6615757	6616337	Okay, nevermind.
6617158	6620321	Uh, I had to pull it up and I was ready to go and everything.
6620841	6624144	Uh, no, I know I have more stuff to talk about here, I just have to pull it up.
6626226	6626907	Do-do-do.
6628648	6628769	Um...
6631598	6632358	What was I going to say?
6633319	6634119	Words?
6635620	6637101	Words, yes, specifically.
6637921	6651848	No, I was going to say that those people out there that are thinking about possibly hacking your PlayStation 3 using the readily available custom firmwares that are out there, you may remember that they have ways of tracking you down.
6652028	6657351	So make sure you get one of those things that erases your... What was it?
6657371	6657491	The...
6660636	6662017	Game History or something like that.
6662658	6668082	A lot of the new programs still have that built in so that you don't get caught.
6670764	6671285	LA Noire.
6671585	6675788	That was a game that also had a trailer leaked out for it.
6676829	6679491	Also going to be coming out from Take-Two in May.
6679691	6681413	This on May 17th.
6682193	6684615	Big game for Rockstar.
6684995	6685876	It looks awesome.
6687377	6696764	Plants vs. Zombies and Peggle coming to the Android Marketplace the second quarter of this year.
6699526	6699947	Pretty neat.
6701283	6702624	Again, the phones are open.
6702644	6703024	1-877-GAME-OLR.
6703044	6704285	Damn it, call!
6704385	6707746	Our usual name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
6708927	6709868	It's going to be another one of those nights.
6709888	6713790	Get your lazy butts up, pick up your phone, and give us a call.
6714190	6715190	If you have something to say.
6715290	6716971	I'm just going to sit here on the line.
6717031	6720093	Talk about a video game, and you better not be... What's your face?
6722714	6724955	Now see, I saw this story and I thought of you, Jamie.
6726075	6734017	Epic Mickey, they're talking about 10 different Easter eggs that are in this game from different Disney history and stuff like that.
6734117	6744119	For example, in the game, actually in Mickey Junk Mountain, they actually have a basketball court in the...
6746260	6747741	in that part of the game as well.
6748001	6748261	That's cool.
6748281	6751643	They kind of allude to the basketball court that's in Matterhorn.
6752064	6752864	That's cool.
6752964	6753645	Let's go to the phones.
6753685	6754585	We do have a call on the line.
6754645	6755666	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6755686	6756046	Who's this?
6757167	6758268	Hi, can you hear me?
6758308	6758848	We sure can.
6758948	6759369	Who is this?
6760169	6761370	Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
6761490	6762631	DDR Dollar Bill.
6762731	6763371	What is on your mind?
6764512	6765633	Hey, not much.
6766253	6773778	I took your advice a couple weeks ago, and then I actually picked up a, well, I guess you could call it an indie game, but one that's been getting a whole bunch of hype from everybody.
6773979	6774339	What's that?
6775404	6775964	Minecraft.
6777185	6777626	Ah, okay.
6777966	6783731	Now, for those that didn't hear, you called in a couple weeks ago and I believe it was something about, I am just frustrated with games today.
6784351	6789376	It's same shit, different year, you know, I feel like there's no games for me to play.
6789396	6790316	And I said, well, try indie.
6790777	6794580	So you went for a popular indie title, but an indie one nonetheless, Minecraft.
6794600	6795401	What do you think of Minecraft?
6798723	6799004	Hello?
6799444	6799944	Did we lose him?
6801045	6801726	Can you still hear us?
6803715	6804295	God damn it.
6804976	6805576	I think we lost.
6805596	6806057	Can you hear me?
6806177	6806957	Yes, we can now.
6806997	6807217	Hi.
6807618	6809439	What did you think of... Hi.
6809459	6809779	Stupid mic.
6810019	6810740	Did you mute yourself?
6810760	6811240	Hi, can you hear me?
6811440	6812281	What did you think of Minecraft?
6812301	6815763	Yes, we can.
6815903	6817564	For a beta, I'm very impressed.
6818505	6818805	Yeah?
6820086	6820506	Yeah.
6820726	6824829	It's weird that it's the total freedom to do anything.
6825928	6831694	It's almost like I feel like I have nothing to do, but I'm just enjoying just doing nothing.
6832214	6834156	Okay, I have never played Minecraft.
6834276	6836838	I read a lot about it on the interwebs, but I've not played it.
6836919	6839201	So can you tell me what Minecraft is?
6839281	6840242	What do you do in Minecraft?
6842684	6850491	The best way I could say this is you pretty much make stuff to sort of build...
6851499	6860293	Well, the idea is that you pretty much have to build your shelter and your tools and everything out of different parts you find here and there during the day.
6860854	6866462	And you have to make a good shelter because at night you get invaded by zombies and skeletons and spiders.
6868116	6872319	So you want to be safe at night, and then you do the same thing every day.
6872579	6878463	Daytime, you build stuff and raise trees and make flowers and kill animals for food.
6878763	6881985	At night, you pretty much either hide or you defend yourself.
6882185	6889890	Okay, so there is kind of an actual game to it, because I was always under the impression that there really wasn't a lot to it outside of creation and building.
6890290	6891150	So that's kind of cool.
6891311	6895053	Okay, so you're trying to prevent zombies from eating your face.
6895573	6896314	I like stuff...
6896954	6898374	So that's kind of cool.
6898754	6905956	So did this help kind of break your video game blaws or are you still looking for that game that just makes you love video games again?
6908336	6914757	It sort of helped kill the blaws because I also realized that I'm pretty much a PC gamer for life now.
6917638	6922099	I'm pretty much shied away from PS3 and Xbox and I like playing on a PC a lot better.
6922679	6922899	Why?
6924636	6925417	I'll give you an example.
6925877	6929219	I tried out the demo the other day for Mass Effect 2 just for shits and giggles.
6931781	6935823	It ran so much better on my computer than on the Xbox or PS3.
6937864	6944609	So it's more a matter of you feel like the technology that the games need today, maybe the console cycle's gone on too long.
6945149	6947190	You know, let's face it, 360's been out now.
6947230	6948611	It's going on its fifth year, right?
6949111	6951293	So maybe it's time for some new consoles?
6951313	6951393	Yeah.
6952960	6962849	Um, either that or some heavy updates and whatnot, because my computer's not that old either, but it was running circles around, like, the consoles.
6962909	6964030	I was like, what the hell?
6964731	6970596	Well, a lot of it has to do with your, um, uh, lost the word, the video card as well.
6970956	6972117	You know, that's a big part of it, too.
6972418	6973719	So you have a newer video card in your system?
6974878	6977359	Yeah, I mean, I got one just last year.
6978220	6979640	It's still a new one.
6980021	6987004	My processor's old, but it's one of those things where, logically, it doesn't make sense, but it just works.
6988425	6993468	Going to our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com, Bochikawa says, Minecraft is like Legos, the RPG.
6993768	6998530	You know, there is actually a really fun, like, just a Lego builder game that is on the official Lego website.
6998550	6999291	It's not really a game.
6999331	6999851	It's like a tool.
7000151	7000471	DarkSakura.com
7027279	7027779	Awesome!
7028799	7032500	Well, DDR Dollar Bill, we're going to let you go to get some more calls, but any quick final thoughts for our listeners?
7034660	7035961	Yeah, support PC gaming.
7036481	7037281	Alright, we'll try.
7037661	7040861	Hey, Steam is going to save PC gaming, if it hasn't already.
7041442	7042162	Hey, Steam rocks.
7042782	7043722	And the indie stuff, of course.
7043962	7044742	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
7045362	7046983	You too, thanks guys.
7047003	7050543	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype if you want to give us a call.
7051403	7053104	Any other last minute stories for us?
7053924	7054544	I have nothing.
7056137	7056657	I'm sure.
7057158	7058218	You'll just have to make something up.
7058878	7061039	Wait, no, I want DarkSakura to make something up.
7061199	7062779	Make up a video game news story.
7062839	7064680	Something that actually didn't happen.
7071801	7073102	I'm putting her on the spot, people.
7073162	7073862	It's live radio.
7076653	7076993	Chirp.
7077773	7078133	Chirp.
7078674	7080274	Oh, a new Angry Birds game is coming out?
7080474	7084635	Yeah, a new Angry Birds versus DarkSakura.
7085395	7087216	Angry Birds versus Angry Co-host.
7088676	7091917	No, I was going to say Angry Birds versus Zombies.
7093317	7099179	Of course, because everything indie these days is something something versus Zombies, right?
7100479	7101139	Indeed.
7101359	7102220	Let's go to another call.
7102260	7103260	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7103280	7103620	Who's this?
7104212	7105073	Hey, this is X-Link.
7105133	7105954	Hey, buddy, how you doing?
7106394	7106995	Hey, doing good.
7107035	7110879	I got to play with the PS3 Move for my first time.
7111299	7112561	Ah, what'd you think of the PS3 Move?
7113294	7115396	I, depending on the game, I really like it.
7116076	7124361	Though I did like the bowling and the sports one they had out.
7124902	7125922	It was pretty fun.
7126723	7127443	It was a lot of fun.
7127523	7134228	It had a lot of similarities to that of Wii, but the graphics and the way they did it was a lot better.
7134568	7139852	The output and the way it was controlled was, I think, personally for me, was a lot smoother.
7139992	7140212	Yeah.
7142104	7146107	Maybe this is a really hard question to ask, but it's something I've given a lot of thought to myself.
7146187	7148730	I've said this on the show before.
7148870	7158438	Connect and Move, they're out there now, and most of the games that have come out originally are, for the most part, with a few exceptions, copies of Wii games with nicer graphics.
7158839	7160660	Where do you think the Move goes next?
7161141	7164244	Can you see the Move integrated into Sony's core franchises?
7164764	7165265	The world.
7165725	7167727	It's going to become the world like that of .hack//.
7168362	7172549	We're gonna have visors and everything and it's gonna become one big MMO.
7173874	7176595	It already is in their core franchises.
7176615	7178515	A lot of it really feels like an afterthought, though.
7178555	7179435	Like LittleBigPlanet 2.
7180036	7182376	Yeah, the move support's there, in a bonus level.
7182496	7183416	No, I understand that.
7183456	7184357	That's just retarded.
7184397	7187377	That's just basically the prehistoric thing that's in there.
7188117	7193379	No, I'm saying it's in their core franchises, as in SOCOM 4 and Killzone 3.
7194299	7195479	Those are core franchises.
7195819	7196519	Okay.
7196579	7202481	Granted, I don't pay attention to a lot of the first-person shooters, and I remember seeing that at the GDC even, but...
7202941	7208125	But granted, their gun that they have, their little shell, is retarded looking.
7209066	7209587	Just saying.
7211128	7212029	No, I agree with you.
7212109	7212889	I agree with you on that.
7213730	7220796	I'm hoping that people will step up to the plate on those things and make stuff better, like actual better looking guns and stuff like that.
7222105	7226026	You know, like, for example, like Time Crisis with Namco, I like the guns they use.
7226086	7229167	It makes you feel like you're playing the arcade with the actual guns.
7229227	7233529	So the guns are quite different from that of the arcade because of the feedback and whatnot.
7234409	7235490	And there's no pedal button.
7235530	7238230	But still, I think it'll do good.
7238771	7240491	It's moving in the right direction, I believe.
7242272	7247333	It's sad, though, because it's really killing off stuff like arcades and stuff that I grew up loving as a kid.
7247393	7249454	It's just, you know, it's hard to compete.
7250103	7250283	Yeah.
7259335	7262216	You know, MMOs for real used to be going to the arcade.
7262276	7264157	You know, I don't know.
7264297	7265438	It's depressing.
7265678	7269219	Instead of booting up your computer or your Xbox and playing the game.
7269279	7270440	Yeah, it really was.
7270960	7280023	And it was a lot of fun putting your quarters and stuff on top of, you know, in certain areas saying, hey, look, I want to be next, you know, or have to be, you know, wait in line.
7280264	7284265	You know, I guess maybe it saved that 20-minute wait from playing that one game that you really want to play.
7284345	7285746	But at the same time, too, you know...
7287167	7287867	It's kind of sad.
7288167	7293490	That feeling you got of being around a big crowd and they're cheering you on and stuff.
7293730	7294871	It's not really the same.
7296251	7304496	I think it would be cool if they would make an MMO that kind of, if you can't beat them, join them.
7305156	7307217	Make an MMO about going to arcades.
7307237	7308498	That's what Game Room should have been.
7308518	7312280	An MMO where you're going to the arcade and playing these old school games and
7312880	7317665	and the better you get at games, the better you can skill up your character to maybe help you get like cheap.
7317826	7319788	I don't want to say cheap, but get better in other games.
7319808	7320288	I don't know.
7320589	7321429	There's an idea there.
7321650	7322711	No, I agree on that.
7322851	7323351	That'd be cool.
7323632	7324933	What's the best thing you played on Move?
7324973	7326234	I'll kind of end it with that question.
7327095	7328717	Well, unfortunately, I only played two different games.
7328757	7332181	So probably the bowling because I did really well against my friends on that one.
7332241	7334183	So the Bronx was bowling.
7336419	7353946	Also, really quickly, Gearbox I think is going to do really great with the Duke Nukem because they did a really great job with Borderlands and their DLC, so if they keep it close to making it somewhat of the original feel, from what I've seen from the trailers and stuff, I think they're going to do a really good job.
7354086	7356387	It's going to be really interesting to see what they do with it.
7357207	7380446	and I know they really are with their fans and what the fans want so I wouldn't be surprised if they make some kind of mod so you can build your own strip club or or build your own like miniature you know I would see a lot of that probably coming out near down the road also because a lot of feedback has been really positive on it so and they really want what the people want so it's that's been a really good positive thing too so
7381594	7388536	One day, one day we'll have our arcades again, but we'll take that next great invention to bring people back.
7389316	7389576	UQ.
7389756	7395898	More beer in arcades, that's what it really needs, because you look at the arcades that are popular, Dave & Buster's, the retro arcades, they all serve beer.
7396998	7401959	Well, there's one by where I used to live, believe it or not, that did the same thing too, and it was very popular.
7402300	7403400	Less kids, more beer.
7403480	7407841	It's EDR, so I mean, pretty much go hand in hand, so yeah.
7409037	7411958	Alright, well buddy, we're going to let you go to try and fit in a couple more calls, but have a good one.
7412498	7413338	Hey, you too, no problem.
7413358	7414139	Alright, thanks, bye.
7415559	7417040	Alright, so let's go to another call.
7417720	7419480	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
7420721	7421461	Hey, it's Zappy.
7421801	7423001	Hey, Zappy, how you doing?
7424262	7424882	Oh, pretty good.
7425262	7426322	Alright, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
7427843	7436085	Well, I've been playing one of the big releases of the week, well, only big releases of the week, Little Big Plan 2, and I can't say more than it's awesome.
7436894	7438495	I noticed that there's a lot more variety when I'm playing it.
7438515	7443338	LittleBigPlanet 1 was a good, solid platformer, but with the second one, they really tried to make it different, having different gimmicks in it.
7443378	7444819	Sort of like how they had Yoshi in Super Mario World.
7467009	7472354	So what's some of the cool stuff you've seen in the user-created levels?
7472494	7478259	I don't know if you've had a chance to dip in there, but have you seen any really cool user-created stuff yet?
7496747	7501989	One of the cool things I saw was they made an entire tower defense game out of the little big tiny engines.
7502829	7503450	Oh wow, nice.
7505010	7514874	Yeah, I was kind of surprised they could do that, but they designed this in mind that you can basically take whatever game ideas you want and make it, which is really exciting.
7515336	7523759	Speaking of taking whatever ideas you want and making it, and I apologize for deviating from your call a little bit, but in the last call we were talking about ways to save arcades.
7524299	7525860	And of course our chat room is going off on that.
7526040	7528481	SJ100Matt says, tits could save arcades.
7529661	7532922	And Xlink says, now that could be a good idea.
7533283	7535343	So maybe you need to mix strip clubs with arcades.
7535423	7536964	When in doubt, show some tits.
7538761	7540362	DarkSakura.com
7566856	7568217	I shit you not, look it up.
7568417	7569398	It's on Wikipedia.
7569518	7570179	Nuts and Milk.
7571159	7572260	And that could be the name of the arcade.
7572280	7573061	How does that get past censors?
7573721	7574182	What's that?
7575303	7576684	How does that get past censors?
7576724	7577745	Because it's Japan.
7577925	7578525	It's not the same.
7578745	7580086	They don't have the same slang.
7580767	7581427	It's different.
7582308	7583009	So, alright.
7584670	7585831	Oh yeah, LittleBigPlanet 2.
7585931	7588933	So have you played the Nuts and Milk remake in LittleBigPlanet 2 yet?
7590594	7593537	I'm sure it's coming along any day now, but unfortunately not.
7594257	7595338	Okay, that's too bad.
7595717	7598839	Alright, so anything else you've been playing lately?
7598880	7601241	Just a little bit of Planets 2 taking up your time, or any other games?
7602342	7604664	I've also been playing some Dead Space, the first one.
7604764	7606986	I'm looking forward to the new one that's coming out this week.
7607967	7611429	And I can't believe you missed this game in 2008, because it's really fun.
7613131	7618535	Because it went off my radar for so long, going, okay, to make a second one, there must be something to it.
7619496	7622498	And I can't believe it.
7622858	7624920	It's really going back to the survival horror roots
7625390	7630479	where you're actually getting freaked out, like you're thinking that something is around that next corner and there might be.
7631667	7644390	That kind of sucks when games, like, you find out about them, like, three years after they were out, and then, like, by the time you're like, this game was fucking rad, you found out that the development studio got closed and everybody got laid off.
7644430	7646110	Like, I bet you anything that still happened to Blur.
7648490	7654632	When the game's down to 20 bucks, if it's not already, it'll start selling more copies, and then people are like, wow, they should really make a sequel to this.
7655592	7656572	Oh, shit, they can't.
7658120	7660201	Yeah, it's a shame it happened.
7660742	7661862	Literally, it was pretty fun.
7662422	7662663	Mm-hmm.
7663523	7663823	All right.
7664184	7666565	Well, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight before we let you go?
7667926	7668206	I don't know.
7668226	7668546	That's it.
7668966	7669206	All right.
7669226	7670447	Well, have fun with LittleBigPlanet 2.
7670967	7672748	Hopefully, I'll be playing it pretty soon as well.
7672828	7674990	Just, you know, got to wait to save up the money.
7676330	7676531	Okay.
7676911	7677131	All right.
7677151	7679913	Later, buddy.
7679933	7683595	877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
7684115	7685796	I didn't realize that call came in from Canada.
7685816	7685896	Yeah.
7687799	7717209	maybe he had said that before that he was kidding my friend just got back from Toronto actually he's coming back in tonight you know Grandpa Warcraft went to Toronto went to Toronto and is coming back tonight cool yeah I want to go to Toronto I've never been here it's really fun Vancouver is awesome though I want to go to Vancouver like how can Toronto be better than Vancouver I'm sure there's a lot of people that live in Toronto that are mad at me for saying that but seriously Vancouver is awesome awesome let's go to the phones there's some more calls coming in hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
7718769	7719369	This is Chortles.
7719769	7720309	Chortles!
7720669	7721490	Hi buddy, how are you?
7722110	7722450	Hey.
7722770	7723790	Hey, what's on your mind tonight?
7723950	7724370	Chortles?
7724830	7730892	Um, honestly, I was just considering, is it just me or is this your PlayStation?
7731892	7732952	Okay, let's put it this way.
7733152	7744595	You know how Activision, is it true that on PlayStation Network, the publishers have to put out the servers themselves for the multiplayer?
7746212	7747635	I've been considering that in the wake of...
7753001	7759385	Okay, I'm not sure if I'm overhearing this, but basically, have you heard of reports about PlayStation Network getting hacked recently?
7760426	7761507	Loki, does that sound familiar to you?
7761527	7763368	The PlayStation Network's been getting hacked recently?
7763768	7765369	I don't follow that stuff as well as he does.
7765389	7765910	Not really.
7767010	7768652	I'm sure somebody's trying to hack it.
7768692	7770273	The PlayStation 3's getting hacked, I guess.
7770313	7774956	Yeah, which probably includes PlayStation Network and all this stuff with the Modern Warfare and so on.
7775236	7776957	Yeah, I'm sure you've heard that.
7778518	7782441	I just want to jump quickly back to your question about the whole central servers and who's really running them.
7783081	7807149	I think to some extent the publishers are running I mean I don't know the ins and outs of games but like for example EA we just had a story on them a couple weeks ago that they were shutting down the servers for a bunch of old sports titles so I think they do run servers I think what Microsoft and PlayStation what they're running is kind of like the matchmaking and distribution services when you download upgrades and so forth that's coming from their servers because they're getting a cut of the profits
7807629	7810050	DC Universe Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI Final Fantasy XI
7827199	7829640	I guess most people aren't looking to it for Final Fantasy XI.
7855075	7865844	But the reason I was wondering that is because on the one hand, you know, you have the whole idea about, oh, you get... Yeah, go ahead.
7866084	7866745	Yeah, I'm sorry.
7866985	7872890	I just realized that I'm actually hearing what we just said previously for like a few seconds later as a background echo.
7872910	7875011	Good old school first rule of calling into radio.
7875052	7877213	Turn down your radio because it throws everybody off.
7877273	7877754	It's all right.
7878094	7878995	Yeah, fair enough, man.
7881377	7882518	I was just considering that in...
7884133	7896839	The fact that Activision has the deal with Microsoft to have released the DLC first on 360, isn't that like for the next two Call of Duties at least as well?
7898211	7905218	I'm not sure the specifics of the agreement, but it's certainly not uncommon that one console gets download content that the other consoles don't get.
7905278	7908701	That's, I think, buying exclusives for further.
7908941	7910362	You want to cite another example?
7910563	7914506	Look at what's going on with the PlayStation 3 and Portal 2, which we talked about in the Rapid Fire News earlier.
7914546	7915667	Oh, I heard about that.
7915687	7915908	Yeah, the...
7916468	7918530	Is Portal 2 coming to 360, by the way?
7918750	7923493	It is, but Sony is really trying to do everything they can to make theirs.
7923533	7928377	And this is the quote from what they said at E3, the definitive version of Portal 2.
7929978	7934822	Well, which is funny considering that that means free access to the other two versions.
7936423	7942488	I mean, to the home computer versions, which come to think of it, that's actually a business model I really like.
7942908	7944930	You pay for the game once, and then...
7946057	7952839	You have the game period in whichever way it's playable other than 360.
7953220	7955360	I love that model too.
7955460	7965084	I don't know if you heard the guy earlier that called in saying that he's all about PC gaming now because consoles just aren't doing it for him and the games run better on his PC.
7965424	7967844	I think he'd be frothing at the mouth about an idea like that.
7967944	7972046	Imagine buying Mass Effect 2 on the PlayStation and you get it on all consoles.
7972586	7975687	Yeah, like, that would be my sort of thing.
7975887	7979088	I mean, I could not get enough of that.
7979328	7990012	I mean, it's funny that he's revived his love of PC games, because, okay, I'll just let you know what I've been doing over the winter.
7990412	7990912	Basically...
7992541	7999326	I think one of the only games that I bought for a console in 2010 was Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
7999946	8001287	Mind you, that was a launch game.
8001727	8004469	It was immensely satisfying for a while.
8004529	8005850	I don't regret that purchase.
8006730	8007191	But then...
8008448	8014234	After a while, it petered out, especially when it came to trying to get good connectivity for the multiplayer.
8014795	8022102	And while there were some severe issues with lag and multiplayer... The baby escaped.
8022803	8025145	There's a baby in the background that appears to have escaped.
8027688	8028168	You know what I'm...
8029958	8032200	Okay, let me put it this way.
8032260	8036103	I'm not going to pretend how she would know the word lag.
8036223	8037264	I'm just going to leave it at that.
8039445	8041066	DarkSakura, can you get CPS on the line?
8041106	8042107	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
8046310	8055317	I'm sorry if this is boring everyone who's listening in, but basically I found that over the holidays, I was doing my Christmas shopping and...
8056057	8061180	Unlike last year, I found that there wasn't much that I was looking for in the way of Steam.
8061741	8065883	I mean, yes, I know about the legendary Steam holiday and summer sales.
8066264	8076390	I have partaken of them in past years, but this time I found that even though I was sitting on a nice chunk of change, I mainly just wanted to upgrade my hardware.
8076810	8077371	For example...
8079022	8082727	Okay, main thing that I changed is my video card.
8083147	8088754	Originally, I was using onboard... I was using onboard video, don't ask.
8089254	8094501	But as a result, basically this time around, I decided to upgrade to a...
8096130	8101773	Radeon HD 5770 made by MSI, 1GB.
8102353	8105315	I think a lot of the draw for me was the cooling.
8107216	8109897	Like two fans, three heat pipes, a heat sink.
8110258	8111358	It was pretty cool stuff.
8111518	8114420	And so far, it seems to run all my games decently.
8115360	8120943	You know, it's really about, I think with the PC, it's really about the hardware and making the right choices with that.
8121003	8123264	And if you invest with that, you're going to get a huge payback.
8123344	8129627	I mean, I know I upgraded my video card last year so I could run Warcraft better, which is the only PC game I need to be playing.
8129707	8130787	No, I'm kidding.
8131007	8131487	Oh, no, no.
8131507	8135829	Hey, I've played World of Warcraft for a long time.
8136370	8141232	I took the weak trial for Cataclysm, but I'm not paying for that right now.
8141992	8146296	Although, I will give this advice to anyone who plays World of Warcraft.
8147277	8154203	Even if you take a break in the form of, like, canceling your subscription or not playing a while, get the Battle.net authenticator.
8154583	8159447	Like, if you don't already have it and you use a smartphone, just get the mobile authenticator.
8159727	8162069	Because you don't want people using your account while you're not there.
8162590	8166153	Yeah, I've actually had that happen to me in, like, in the summer of 2010.
8166193	8166293	Like...
8168490	8174032	Two weeks after my subscription ran out, boom, my account was hacked.
8174652	8178373	A lot of stuff got stolen.
8178833	8183735	My all-time highest level item got jacked.
8184355	8192178	And by the time I found out, got my account unhacked and got back into World of Warcraft.
8193119	8195280	It was too late for Blizzard to recover my stuff.
8195360	8199503	Yeah, and it's a story I have heard way, way, way too many times.
8199744	8204607	But Chortles, I gotta wrap up and let you go because if I keep letting you talking, pretty soon they're gonna give you our time slot.
8204647	8206168	So I gotta wrap up and let you go.
8206729	8207549	Find the baby!
8208490	8211953	I'll probably be more focused next time, I suppose.
8212033	8214094	That baby has walked out the front door by now.
8214154	8214595	Go get him.
8214875	8215135	Alright.
8215335	8215776	Yeah, alright.
8215856	8216496	Alright, bye.
8219264	8220504	Thank you, Chortles, for that call.
8221245	8222565	He was just really happy to be here.
8223545	8224626	He sounded happy.
8224746	8225906	I like enthusiasm.
8226566	8227047	Brains.
8227087	8228227	He was just enthusiastic.
8228487	8228807	Brains.
8229867	8231668	You're saying it was a zombie baby in the background?
8231708	8231908	Yes.
8232488	8232748	All right.
8233309	8233609	Be nice.
8233629	8235449	All right, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
8235489	8236750	Thank you guys so much for calling us.
8237030	8239290	If you didn't get through tonight, please consider sending us an email.
8239691	8243972	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails to.
8244312	8245372	We would really appreciate it.
8245993	8246333	All right.
8247765	8249606	Let's wrap up the show.
8249726	8250187	We're done.
8250247	8251868	Is there any other last-minute stories we've got to get out?
8251888	8252568	Ribbons and bows, Rob.
8252608	8253309	Ribbons and bows.
8253869	8254750	Spank it on the butt.
8254830	8255250	It's done.
8256151	8256731	Slack.
8256911	8257372	I have nothing.
8257772	8258072	All right.
8258212	8260294	Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
8260374	8262055	And we'll start with Loki tonight.
8262415	8263496	Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
8263816	8266678	My sound card decides when it decides to work and not.
8268239	8269000	And I don't like that.
8270221	8274464	My final thought is I took Friday off, so yay for four-day work week next week.
8274484	8274604	Woo!
8275762	8276765	DarkSakura, you have a final thought?
8277668	8278650	Reject false icons
8279492	8281233	Ooh, you going old school.
8281393	8281674	I am.
8281854	8283835	I didn't expect you to whip that out until episode 400.
8284656	8285736	Let me whip this out.
8287137	8288218	She's just getting warmed up.
8288458	8289239	Yeah.
8289319	8291500	I'm warming up my bitch slapping hand.
8291820	8292241	All right.

8305229	8305850	Shh, stop.
8306270	8306870	Like candy.
8309652	8313353	DarkSakura's like, I got a lollipop.
8313413	8314193	I'm trying to do a plug.
8314213	8316334	This is a very important plug I'm trying to do here, DarkSakura.
8316354	8317554	Stop derailing me with your toilet humor.
8317574	8318554	Are you plugging it already?
8318594	8318874	Stop it.

8328877	8341922	tell your friends about the show tell people you think would be interested in people talking about video games and giving folks a voice and hearing people call in and just talk about games they really like that's it
8342389	8343750	Tell your kids, tell your wife.
8343870	8344331	That's right.
8344491	8346893	And tell your husbands because we're gaming everybody out there.
8347353	8348474	Exactly, I think.
8348754	8349895	All right, that's going to do it for another week.
8350235	8352477	We will be back next week to do it all again.
8353317	8354058	I'm so excited.
8354338	8354959	I just can't hide it.
