00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:25,818
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, January 30th, 2011, Sony unveils Project NGP, Portal 2 promises user-generated content, and could cloud save soon beyond the... Hi friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week...

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:40,388
[SPEAKER_09]: This is episode number 399 for January the 30th of 2011.

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:48,536
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games with the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:49,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

6
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:50,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, how are you?

7
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I am doing better than I was.

8
00:00:53,197 --> 00:00:54,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've heard you've been kind of sick lately.

9
00:00:54,678 --> 00:00:55,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to hear about it.

10
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:57,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I have some warm drink.

11
00:00:57,779 --> 00:00:58,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

12
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:58,979
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're welcome.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,481
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have my fuzzy blue binky.

14
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:05,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a snuggie, but it kind of looks like one from far away.

15
00:01:05,682 --> 00:01:09,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very soft fleece, and I think that I got this as a freebie from somewhere.

16
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:12,824
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's been super soft and goes with me on trips.

17
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like my comfort blanket.

18
00:01:15,865 --> 00:01:16,366
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

19
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:37,835
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was just like this blanket, then maybe I could be convinced.

20
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:43,960
[SPEAKER_04]: But I kind of like being shrouded in my warm blanket and being able to pull it over my head if I want to.

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it like a Linus from the Peanuts thing where it's like your security blanket has to go with you everywhere?

22
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:49,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no.

23
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:49,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

24
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:52,939
[SPEAKER_04]: But it makes me feel comforted when I feel weak and sick.

25
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I can use my really low... I just realized I touched that blanket when you were sick.

27
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:01,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I really hope I don't get it.

28
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:03,385
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been washed, Rob.

29
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:07,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's also say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki!

30
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:07,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

31
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,809
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you, Loki?

32
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Sick as well.

33
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:11,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no!

34
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I caught my son's cold.

35
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:14,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh.

36
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:15,055
[SPEAKER_03]: The plague.

37
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:19,158
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright, it's just... I feel like I'm marked because I haven't been sick yet.

38
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Dot dot dot.

39
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I really hope I don't get anything.

40
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:23,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sorry to hear about you being sick as well.

41
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:25,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you get over it.

42
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:26,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's fine.

43
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:38,415
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have to point out, just before the show started, while Bobby's show was finishing up here live at All Games Radio, you were giggling like a schoolgirl over there playing, what was it, Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC?

44
00:02:38,515 --> 00:02:39,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, episodes of Liberty City.

45
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:47,542
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was really funny because you were listening to some gay dance music or something in the game while you were just blowing up

46
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:54,459
[SPEAKER_03]: It was listening to the Russian electronic station in the game.

47
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:55,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

48
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:09,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was playing, well, I was working on map edits, and then I decided, because I still have the crazy car handling in place still, that I'd play around with that, so that's what I was doing.

49
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:10,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.

50
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:14,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it looked like you were having fun because you were giggling as your car was spinning around and around and around.

51
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:18,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because you're not supposed to be able to get in those cars because they go crazy.

52
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,344
[SPEAKER_03]: But since I have the trainer, I can spawn cars and make it so I don't fall off of motorcycles and stuff.

53
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:25,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.

54
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:33,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, and also joining us tonight, of course, you guys, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, as they have over the past, what, nine years we've been doing this show.

55
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:46,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you are listening to us live, because we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.AllGames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

56
00:03:47,074 --> 00:04:14,376
[SPEAKER_09]: and yes we are doing a show next week which is very brave because we are going to compete against Super Bowl Sunday in some ways I don't know I think most of it's wind down I think they're in like the last quarter by the time this show starts but next week's kind of a big deal for us because it's episode number 400 I don't think we're going to do anything too special we might have some surprises in store little things but you know we don't want to do because then we could do we could do a 400th special then we could do a 9th anniversary special then we could do a 10th anniversary you know

57
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:16,297
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to overdo it with the special.

58
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:17,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I like teniversaries.

59
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:18,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week is special.

60
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:19,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Dang it.

61
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,000
[SPEAKER_09]: So we appreciate you guys listening to us over the past few years.

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Really appreciate it.

63
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:33,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Tiger Claw says, It's funny that Snuggies have taken off considering the Slanket was the first one to come up with the idea.

64
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:37,126
[SPEAKER_09]: And Jim Sally says, Snuggies, now with 10% more Slanket.

65
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:41,768
[SPEAKER_09]: So is Snuggie like the Zynga of the blanket making world?

66
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:42,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

67
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:44,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Take with that what you will.

68
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:53,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get into the show and talk about some video games and how is your gaming week and the types of video games you have been playing since you guys have been sick.

69
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:55,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you guys have been playing some games, but let's see.

70
00:04:56,314 --> 00:04:57,294
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what have you been up to?

71
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:00,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I've really just played World of Warcraft.

72
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:02,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict?

73
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:03,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Dealer.

74
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:07,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I hate Icecrown.

75
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,806
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hated it so much that I was like, I just need to power level through it.

76
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:13,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Need to get through with it.

77
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:14,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Need to get through with it.

78
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:15,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

79
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:19,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to thank Alan, by the way, for running me through that.

80
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:24,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was a dungeon, but it was like some tournament area.

81
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:27,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it was in Zul'Drak.

82
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:29,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, the Ring of Blood or whatever it's called.

83
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could get the Slobberknocker.

84
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:37,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But it got me a crap ton of experience on top of it.

85
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:37,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

86
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:47,650
[SPEAKER_04]: So that saved me a couple hours of work and stupid quests to control water elementals, which sucked.

87
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:52,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I just did the joust thing.

88
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:54,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's a little parody.

89
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,955
[SPEAKER_09]: And she's not talking like an actual joust thing, although that's in the game too.

90
00:05:57,975 --> 00:05:58,775
[SPEAKER_04]: You ride a griffin.

91
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:05,117
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's like a make-believe 3D version of the old school 80s game, Joust.

92
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:11,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get a pet from it that's one of the little griffins with a dude on it with a lance.

93
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:12,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get to keep the lance.

94
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I'm going to sell it for probably nothing.

95
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:18,162
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worse.

96
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:21,663
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a zero to one damage item, which makes me laugh.

97
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:29,472
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm actually having a really good time in the really pretty Cataclysm area.

98
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:30,233
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really pretty.

99
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Flowers and fairy dragons.

100
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:33,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I love fairy dragons.

101
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:35,360
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you why I love fairy dragons from D&D.

102
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,884
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend played a fairy dragon named Shimata Hentai.

103
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:39,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

104
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought it was funny.

105
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:42,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm done.

106
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:44,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm high on Sudafed.

107
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,340
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a fun show.

108
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Sudafed, Robitussin, and Benadryl.

109
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:49,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you find that wow?

110
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:53,324
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still blown away every week this goes on.

111
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:55,745
[SPEAKER_09]: That you were a wow hater in 2010.

112
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:57,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't a hater.

113
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:57,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you were.

114
00:06:57,986 --> 00:06:59,848
[SPEAKER_09]: You turned it all around in 2011.

115
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:01,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't a hater.

116
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:02,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you were a disliker.

117
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just bored by it.

118
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:07,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Disliker's going to dislike.

119
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:19,754
[SPEAKER_04]: well you know me I'm gonna give something a chance before I decide that I hate it and enough like I said enough people said it's different that I had to give it a chance

120
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:24,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of MMOs, I've got to go to a comment from TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

121
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:28,333
[SPEAKER_09]: He says his gaming week pretty much consisted of playing DC Universe Online.

122
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:29,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Still haven't reached level 30.

123
00:07:29,993 --> 00:07:31,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm around level 16 or 15.

124
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:34,655
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've got to kind of ask, are there any other MMOs?

125
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:37,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know you're a comic book, even though you're not so much DC.

126
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:38,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you're more of a Marvel girl.

127
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:40,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Do any of these other MMOs interest you?

128
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:44,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've talked also about maybe, maybe I need to go back to Star Trek Online and check out what's going on there.

129
00:07:45,436 --> 00:07:47,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm missed on Star Trek Online.

130
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:49,859
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do miss my fleet.

131
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,540
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cool guys.

132
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:59,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to go back to Star Trek Online for a month to see the new episodes.

133
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,746
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

134
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:04,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it really got to be super redundant.

135
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:10,191
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's been enough different stuff going on in World of Warcraft that I think it's going to keep my attention.

136
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:11,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Because...

137
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:12,332
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

138
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:34,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I've liked all the little neat throw-in stuff, and I really haven't had enough of that in Star Trek Online.

139
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:35,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna give it another go.

140
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:37,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I love Star Trek Online.

141
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,451
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

142
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:42,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I love everything about it, except that I've run out of shit to do.

143
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:45,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Except the endgame got old, basically.

144
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:48,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much, and I hate PvP.

145
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:56,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of curious what you're going to think of the endgame of WoW, because I know you haven't done a lot of the grouping, and to be honest, there's not a whole lot else to do.

146
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:57,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I take that back.

147
00:08:57,134 --> 00:09:03,076
[SPEAKER_09]: They've done a lot of stuff when it comes to reputations and crafting, and there's kind of that to do.

148
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:07,557
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of daily quests you can do, but I worry you're going to find yourself a little bored when you get to the endgame.

149
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,037
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

150
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,990
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to eventually get into it.

151
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I got so wrapped up in questing and it was so much fun to me.

152
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:42,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got a worgen now.

153
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:45,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to make my shopping list over here for WoW School.

154
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:48,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, buy Sorting Hat for Jaimee.

155
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:52,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a worgen now, though.

156
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Because while I was feeling so sick and miserable, Dan decided to cheer me up by getting me Cataclysm.

157
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:59,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And then promptly yelled at me for playing too much Warcraft.

158
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:03,352
[SPEAKER_04]: But I named her Veruca Salt.

159
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:05,072
[SPEAKER_04]: With two A's.

160
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:06,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Veruca Salt.

161
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:07,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Veruca!

162
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:08,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

163
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:09,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I couldn't get Volk's worgen.

164
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, enough MMO chat.

165
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:12,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go over to Loki.

166
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:15,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I know he doesn't play any of them right now, so I'll ask him what has he been playing this week, Loki.

167
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:21,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing, um, not a whole lot actually, just, you know, mainly like Grand Theft Auto stuff, cause that's fun.

168
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:33,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Just been dealing with, I had my JTAG system repaired, and it died in five minutes when I got it back, so I was like, um, that sucks, so I sent it away to get fixed again.

169
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:39,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I did play some stuff on the iPod yesterday, actually.

170
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:44,027
[SPEAKER_03]: You may remember this from when we were talking about it.

171
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a news segment we brought up.

172
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:49,431
[SPEAKER_03]: The game Hamlet, or was it the...

173
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:55,753
[SPEAKER_03]: The Last Game Without MMORPG Features, Shaders, and Product Placement HD

174
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:39,117
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically it's like a point and click adventure game except really dumbed down in a way it's dumbed down the fact that you don't have an inventory you don't have any real exploration or anything it's just okay it's one level and then the next room you're in and the next room you're in and you have to solve a puzzle in each one and there's about 20 some rooms so I was able to finish the game in like 3-4 hours but um

175
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:41,958
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just very weird.

176
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:07,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now I'm interested.

177
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:09,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Who from our generation didn't love Ren and Stimpy?

178
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:13,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you play this like... Rubber Nipples!

179
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,910
[SPEAKER_09]: What rolls downstairs, hops over in pairs, runs over your neighbor's dog.

180
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:31,470
[SPEAKER_03]: You play this time traveler or whatever who comes back to, I guess, Hamlet and accidentally crushes Hamlet and he's injured, so you have to basically do all the things Hamlet would have had to do.

181
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:35,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've already teased a sequel, which is going to be Romeo and Juliet.

182
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:35,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Hamlet 2?

183
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:37,756
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be Romeo and Juliet.

184
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:39,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Hamlet 2, Electric Boogaloo.

185
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:42,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Bummer, because the Hamlet 2 movie is one of those movies.

186
00:12:42,238 --> 00:12:43,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually watched the movie.

187
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:46,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know they have a movie called Hamlet 2, and it's about a guy who's putting on a stage play?

188
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:53,843
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a comedy, and it's actually not very funny, but it's one of those things that's so stupid, you kind of laugh in some parts.

189
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:54,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock me, rock me.

190
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:56,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, rock me, sexy Jesus.

191
00:12:56,804 --> 00:13:03,267
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so absurd, you have to laugh, because this movie clearly was just set out to offend people, and that was kind of funny.

192
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:05,557
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the game's pretty awesome.

193
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,998
[SPEAKER_03]: The only problem I have is that it's short.

194
00:13:07,038 --> 00:13:09,620
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you've beaten it, there's really no reason to play it again.

195
00:13:10,561 --> 00:13:11,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a free game, though?

196
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:11,962
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

197
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:12,422
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

198
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:13,243
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's cheap.

199
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:13,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

200
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:16,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as long as you kind of get what you pay for, so to speak.

201
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:16,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

202
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,346
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a good game.

203
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:21,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the puzzles are pretty hard.

204
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,631
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to think about it, and they give you a little hint.

205
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:27,133
[SPEAKER_03]: But that hint sometimes doesn't really help you.

206
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:30,856
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can usually figure it out pretty quick.

207
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:31,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

208
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:36,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I played the whole game through without using any sort of, you know, cheats or anything.

209
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Telltale in trouble?

210
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they are the kings of the whole point-and-clicky games right now.

211
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little different than that.

212
00:13:43,262 --> 00:13:47,344
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of like, you know, someone that hasn't really played an adventure game.

213
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:55,268
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, okay, you solve this puzzle on this stage, you move to the next stage, and you solve this next puzzle, and they have little boss fights and stuff like that.

214
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:58,170
[SPEAKER_03]: But the boss fights are just very, very odd.

215
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,830
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole game is very odd.

216
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:26,882
[SPEAKER_09]: uh Spazinator's in our chat room saying that he bought some Ren and Stimpy episodes via PSN I had no idea see I wouldn't know what the hell was on the PSN video store if we didn't have Spazinator in our chat room every week or on Twitter or wherever he's at because I never pay attention to what's on I had no idea he had Ren and Stimpy episodes can you even get those on Netflix I don't even know like I'm sure they're all on DVD but they're probably all over YouTube as well I don't know all right anything else uh for your gaming week you want to share with us Loki

217
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:30,742
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, that would be it

218
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,462
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

219
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:16,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

220
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:53,778
[SPEAKER_09]: and they have a couple neat things like they have a 9 minute preview of Tron Legacy which is you know what you would expect to see they turn the Muppets theater into the Tron theater which is kind of funny but they do like lighting effects where when the recognizer comes out the whole theater glows red kind of cute little things like that

221
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:54,758
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

222
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:23,785
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

223
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:40,795
[SPEAKER_09]: It's guaranteed right now on the calendars through March 25th.

224
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:42,837
[SPEAKER_04]: That means we should be there when we go.

225
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:49,164
[SPEAKER_09]: But people are thinking like, oh, maybe it's not going to last through April when the Blu-ray is coming out.

226
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:51,807
[SPEAKER_09]: But my other thought is, what are they going to replace it with?

227
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:56,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Electronica replaced what they called Glowfest, which was the same type of thing, really.

228
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:58,355
[SPEAKER_09]: It just didn't have a Tron theme to it.

229
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,819
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you see the Tron stuff, it's pretty rad what they did.

230
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,882
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's not a whole lot else to see besides that classic arcade and everything.

231
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:10,045
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's crazy because this arcade is full of people.

232
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:19,773
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a freaking line to play the Tron game, which they have perfectly placed in the back with a little subtle cutout in the wall.

233
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Once in a while, you'll see things glowing behind.

234
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:24,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it is perfect, this replica they've set up.

235
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:50,133
[SPEAKER_09]: and they even created this is the thing that just freaked me out they created a game called Space Paranoids that they have in an arcade machine and it's clearly running on a PC because it doesn't use tokens but it's like in a cabinet and it's like a 3D game where you go around and shoot recognizers but you only have so many bullets it's pretty hot I think that's their browser they had a browser game that was like that

236
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:53,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's probably just a browser game like as an arcade machine.

237
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,740
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what that is.

238
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,103
[SPEAKER_09]: And I played Dig Dug, which is one of my favorite classic games.

239
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:02,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Tease me if you will, but I walked out of there with the number one score on the machine.

240
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:02,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

241
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:08,488
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I don't know if it resets every night or what, but hey, I was happy for a minute.

242
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,069
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

243
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,811
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are anywhere near SoCal, you gotta see it.

244
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:39,433
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're an arcade enthusiast, you gotta see it.

245
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:41,114
[SPEAKER_09]: At least once.

246
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:43,775
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pretty cool thing to behold.

247
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:51,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't say it's alone worth the $90 price it costs for a one-day park hopper or whatever.

248
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,340
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pushing it.

249
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,643
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're gonna be going to Disneyland anyway, you gotta make sure you're gonna see this somehow.

250
00:18:58,443 --> 00:18:59,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I really hope...

251
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:21,126
[SPEAKER_09]: that they went to all this work that they just keep it open like really they weren't using that building for anything else just keep the damn thing open until you have something really really good to replace it because it looks like they spent a lot of money converting that building into Flynn's Arcade don't I mean even if they're going to end Electronica keep the freaking arcade don't get rid of it please Disney so

252
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:25,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, folks in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

253
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:27,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Shezro says, wow, Flynn's replica.

254
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:27,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

255
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:28,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I agree.

256
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:29,115
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty awesome.

257
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:30,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

258
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:32,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Bochikawa says, that sounds awesome.

259
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,441
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty awesome.

260
00:19:33,461 --> 00:19:34,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was crowded, though.

261
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:38,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, gosh, I only had time to really play like the one game.

262
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:39,669
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

263
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:43,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Claw says, Sky, are they blasting the Daft Punk soundtrack all over the park?

264
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, no.

265
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:46,394
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't.

266
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:49,977
[SPEAKER_09]: They do some of it, especially during the pre-show leading up to it.

267
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:55,021
[SPEAKER_09]: But when the dance party's going on, it's mostly Top 40 remix stuff.

268
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:58,544
[SPEAKER_09]: But they have people decked out in Tron outfits that are up there dancing.

269
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:00,046
[SPEAKER_09]: And I felt kind of cool because...

270
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:01,287
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

271
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:49,485
[SPEAKER_09]: this is our makeup trip because we didn't get to go that weekend she had two of the discs one blue and one orange and like everybody was coming up to her asking her like where she got the discs and it was just from the freaking souvenir stores and you can get the blue ones at Target actually they have them at Toys R Us yeah so they're not hard to find but it's just kind of funny so Ziba wants to know if I took any pics yes I did I actually took some video too so I'll try to kind of put that all into a compilation video and upload that to YouTube or something if you want to see I'll try to get that up later

272
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:51,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow, so that was really it.

273
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:55,809
[SPEAKER_09]: That was, uh, TigerClaw in our chat says, top 40 music, yuck.

274
00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:58,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I might be misrepresenting a little bit.

275
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:06,992
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot of remixes of top 40 music, but TigerClaw, I know you like the electric and trance stuff, and I think you would be happy with the stuff that they played.

276
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:08,153
[SPEAKER_09]: They played some cool stuff.

277
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:14,755
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, I know my friend constantly had her phone out with SoundHound or whatever that program is that lets you identify songs.

278
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:15,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what's this electronic song?

279
00:21:15,835 --> 00:21:16,356
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this song?

280
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:17,456
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's kind of a mix.

281
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:22,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's move on and actually get into the show itself.

285
00:21:34,384 --> 00:21:38,186
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be starting at 6 o'clock Pacific, promptly 9 o'clock Eastern.

286
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:39,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby actually has the night off due to this.

287
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:44,769
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some football game that people care about here that a lot of people apparently are going to be watching.

288
00:21:45,289 --> 00:22:01,830
[SPEAKER_09]: and we have the balls to go up against it but if you must listen on the podcast feed then I suppose you can join us there too but it'll be more fun I promise if you join us live next week for the 400th episode of OLR all right let's get into tonight's gaming news there was some big stuff big conferences things to talk about right Loki

289
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:07,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the big thing of course is talking about the NGP.

290
00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:15,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And the NGP is what I guess Sony is calling, what everybody's pretty much dubbed the PSP2.

291
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:20,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is one sexy looking piece of equipment there.

292
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:27,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, of course, they, um, had a lot of the stuff that was rumored to be in there.

293
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:48,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, you know, carrying a 5-inch OLED screen, uh, with pretty high resolution on it, four times the PSPs, a front touch screen, a rear touch pad, uh, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, dual analog sticks, um, and it looks pretty awesome.

294
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:49,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh,

295
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:52,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've gotta get one.

296
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:56,166
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't really give a price point.

297
00:22:56,727 --> 00:23:00,469
[SPEAKER_03]: It is supposed to be out at least in one region before the end of the year.

298
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:07,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it looks like both the front and rear little touchpads are multi-touch.

299
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,916
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have a front and rear camera as well.

300
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Built-in microphone, of course.

301
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:23,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also got six-axis motion sensing, including a three-axis gyroscope, three-axis accelerometer, and three-axis electronic compass.

302
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:28,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, you said something that I think I just totally missed during the press conference.

303
00:23:28,227 --> 00:23:29,487
[SPEAKER_09]: You said built-in microphone?

304
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:29,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

305
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a built-in camera on this too?

306
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:32,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Two.

307
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:33,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Front and back.

308
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:36,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this thing's going to have video conferencing then, no question.

309
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

310
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,371
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something they didn't even really advertise.

311
00:23:40,311 --> 00:23:40,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

312
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:47,954
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no other reason to put a front camera on the damn thing than to have some type of competing FaceTime technology or whatever you want to call it.

313
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:48,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Something like that, yeah.

314
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:49,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

315
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:54,876
[SPEAKER_03]: and then Bluetooth and all sorts of other stuff.

316
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:58,077
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm pretty excited about it.

317
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a bunch of things I know.

318
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:09,119
[SPEAKER_03]: They were mentioning, of course, it's going to be backwards compatible with PSP games, like digital games, so you can play PSP games on there, PlayStation 1 games.

319
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:10,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but wait a minute.

320
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:11,800
[SPEAKER_09]: What if I have the games on UMD?

321
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I just kind of screwed?

322
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

323
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,401
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's compatible with PSP Go games.

324
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:17,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Well...

325
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:47,059
[SPEAKER_03]: but you'll be able to play that stuff on there and I would imagine that it's going to be fully compatible with the Playstation 1 stuff now because now you have the dual analog sticks and they're saying that they're full analog sticks so I'm not sure if you can click down on them for the L3 and R3 stuff but as far as like the L2 buttons that right there is your back little touchpad you know you can just the right half is the right button the left half is the left button

326
00:24:47,739 --> 00:25:09,804
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the shoulder buttons could be for everything else since I assume the multi-touch stuff is probably going to be also pressure sensitive so that would be kind of sort of analog but that's pretty awesome and it looks very similar to what you know the normal PSP 3000 looks like right now they're gonna also have I guess there's some

327
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:20,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Some special slots for memory and games and stuff like that, because obviously they're not using disks this time around.

328
00:25:20,877 --> 00:25:27,603
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a proprietary format for both, so it'll take just a little bit longer to crack, I guess.

329
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:33,908
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course they were talking about some of the games that are going to be out for it as well.

330
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:44,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the games in the works, Uncharted, Killzone, Resistance, LittleBigPlanet and a game called Little Deviants which looks like the first kind of original game for the system.

331
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:50,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously most of their, I'd say all of their big franchise games are going to be coming out there.

332
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,782
[SPEAKER_03]: They did show Uncharted which is

333
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:54,923
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

334
00:26:17,435 --> 00:26:21,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty, Broken, Gravity Days, Hot Shots Golf, Hustle Kings, Reality Fighters, Resistance, Smart Ass, and Wipeout.

335
00:26:47,054 --> 00:26:47,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

336
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:54,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they didn't name a price or a date, but if you thought they were going to do that this early, then you were kind of wishful thinking.

337
00:26:54,757 --> 00:27:02,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Because E3 is really the time to do that, and let's face it, when Nintendo first unveiled the 3DS, they didn't say any of that either.

338
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,981
[SPEAKER_09]: They just came out with the price and date, what, two months ago?

339
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:07,922
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's coming out in March.

340
00:27:08,822 --> 00:27:12,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Or no, last month, and it's coming out in March.

341
00:27:12,103 --> 00:27:13,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we talking about price and date for the 3DS?

342
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:13,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

343
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it just came out a couple weeks ago.

344
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:19,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I meant two months out of the actual release was when the dates came out.

345
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:32,272
[SPEAKER_09]: So to think that Sony was going to release the release date of this and the price and everything now, 11 months before release or whatever, was a little bit... No, I bet they don't even know what it's going to cost yet.

346
00:27:32,612 --> 00:27:36,633
[SPEAKER_09]: They're probably trying to gauge the whole consumer reaction or also the price technology.

347
00:27:36,693 --> 00:27:38,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it goes down so rapidly.

348
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:39,234
[SPEAKER_09]: So who knows?

349
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:44,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Price is kind of important, obviously.

350
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:46,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's too early to say if I really want to get one or not.

351
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,023
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it really depends on what's all there when it comes out.

352
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:55,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely getting one just because I have store credit for the Sony store.

353
00:27:55,047 --> 00:27:58,050
[SPEAKER_03]: $280 of that's already spoken for.

354
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:02,414
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it's not something stupid or ridiculous like $400 or...

355
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:08,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Even $400 might not be that bad with $280 taken out of the way.

356
00:28:09,168 --> 00:28:13,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually thinking $400 might not be completely out of the realm of possibility.

357
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:19,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to be $400 because it would be hard to justify a handheld system being more expensive than a console system.

358
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:22,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

359
00:28:23,272 --> 00:28:25,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at its competition.

360
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:26,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that.

361
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:27,755
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't mean the 3DS.

362
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:29,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're talking about.

363
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:29,656
[SPEAKER_09]: The iPad.

364
00:28:30,116 --> 00:28:32,957
[SPEAKER_09]: And the iPad with 3G is what?

365
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,198
[SPEAKER_09]: $650 for the lowest model?

366
00:28:34,218 --> 00:28:34,658
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing.

367
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,761
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com

368
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:06,968
[SPEAKER_03]: and I sure as hell am not buying an iPad.

369
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:09,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, but you know.

370
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:36,646
[SPEAKER_03]: that may be if they want to play that gamble then go ahead but I think it's going to end up flopping on them just like you know the PSP Go although this will be a little bit easier of an argument because it's you know a new system and stuff but you know they're talking that there's probably going to be multiple SKUs on it one for 3G one for Wi-Fi personally I'd just pick up the Wi-Fi one because I don't want to fucking another data plan exactly tethered to my fucking phone that's what I'm going to do

371
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:49,219
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkKisuke in our chatroom is dying for an educated guess from us gaming analysts wants to know an educated guess for the price I'll give you my best guess I'm going to say $300 without 3G and $400 with it

372
00:29:53,562 --> 00:30:04,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's... Considering the level of technology they're trying to put in this thing and all these other little features and stuff, I think that's not outside the realm of possibility.

373
00:30:04,748 --> 00:30:15,913
[SPEAKER_09]: However, one big, big wild card to keep in mind is Apple's next iPad, which they're going to have a big announcement and they're going to release it within the next couple months.

374
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:19,475
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to be an Apple psychic to know that.

375
00:30:20,616 --> 00:30:46,317
[SPEAKER_09]: so if they manage to really cut the cost of those things that could make Sony have to kind of do a counter move but seeing as I don't want to go too far off base here but I believe those new iPads will probably have the same retina display that the iPhone 4s are using right now and it's going to make those things absolutely gorgeous they'll probably still be charging at least $600 if you want an iPad with 3GS

376
00:30:47,978 --> 00:31:04,288
[SPEAKER_09]: so we'll see so Sony can still at least be cheaper than an iPad if they do that and I kind of think that's going to be where their niche could be is that the Sony NGP could kind of be like cheaper than an iPad but does a lot of the same stuff at least as far as games are concerned

377
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:10,451
[SPEAKER_09]: so, we'll see Ranma on our chatroom says, can someone tell me what NGP stands for?

378
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:33,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Next Generation Portable it is a working name, like Natal was, do not expect that to be the final name, I would be very surprised if they really, I actually don't really care for that as a name because, and somebody in the chat had said it earlier, by the time the NGP releases, it's going to be the CGP, the current generation portable, so it would be a little silly for them to actually call it that

379
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:36,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the Neptune.

380
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:38,066
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, huh?

381
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:42,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the Dolphin was the Nintendo GameCube at one point.

382
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the Revolution was the Wii.

383
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:47,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So these code names, nothing new.

384
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:51,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very curious to see what they're going to name it.

385
00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:54,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of don't think they would do PSP2.

386
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:57,481
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't roll off the tongue as nicely as PSP.

387
00:31:58,302 --> 00:31:58,742
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

388
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:05,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that sounds really nitpicky, but it's like all the extra syllables or something.

389
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:09,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I'm being weird, but I just don't see PSP2 being it either.

390
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:11,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

391
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:11,893
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

392
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:17,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk a little more about what's going on with the new Sony system and its feature.

393
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:25,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of like this because I like to see what the systems are doing besides just remakes of the same old games now on a portable.

394
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:29,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to know where are they going to be taking the games.

395
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,731
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was very interested with this.

396
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:32,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Something called Live Area.

397
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:35,756
[SPEAKER_09]: You might have seen some of the little promos, some of the art's

398
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,698
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

399
00:33:02,276 --> 00:33:03,717
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

400
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,234
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

401
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:41,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

402
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Very curious.

403
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:45,208
[SPEAKER_09]: and people, you know what, that Pokemon thing with the walking trainer and all that was really popular so it's not outside the realm of possibility that people kind of like these ideas of being rewarded for going places.

404
00:34:45,228 --> 00:34:48,750
[SPEAKER_09]: 3DS is doing something similar too with the whole coins thing, built-in pedometer.

405
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,331
[SPEAKER_09]: So, hmm, will be interesting.

406
00:34:52,151 --> 00:34:53,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

407
00:34:54,412 --> 00:34:57,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, news for our UK listeners.

408
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:07,485
[SPEAKER_04]: The 3DS eShop is actually not going to go live like they said it would with launch.

409
00:35:07,525 --> 00:35:09,607
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually said that it's going to go live in May.

410
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:15,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Nintendo UK said that it was going to be there with the launch.

411
00:35:16,012 --> 00:35:19,434
[SPEAKER_04]: But Iwata basically said, nope, nope, nope.

412
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:23,817
[SPEAKER_04]: The first system update is scheduled for late May, the same time around the world.

413
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:25,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just them.

414
00:35:25,618 --> 00:35:26,198
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everybody.

415
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I'm glad Iwata came out and actually said something himself.

416
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:36,925
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, they need to make sure that all of their reps are on the same page.

417
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:38,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think?

418
00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:43,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it kind of makes it sound like they don't even know when the damn thing is launching.

419
00:35:43,146 --> 00:35:44,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of like, it'll be done when it's done.

420
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:50,689
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be out in Europe on March 25th, but we won't have the eShop until the first system update.

421
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

422
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is going to be in May.

423
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:57,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it seem now that maybe they're rushing the 3DS a little bit?

424
00:35:58,313 --> 00:35:58,693
[SPEAKER_09]: A bit.

425
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:01,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they should have just waited to release it until summertime.

426
00:36:01,734 --> 00:36:07,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe there's something about May, like why you have to release it in that type of time frame or something like that.

427
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:08,036
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

428
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:10,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, March.

429
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:15,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why they couldn't have delayed this a little bit if it's not really ready.

430
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:20,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're going to sell most of these at Christmastime anyway, right?

431
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:22,998
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be reasonable to me.

432
00:36:25,031 --> 00:36:25,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

433
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:30,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also say that because of the launch games.

434
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:35,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of doesn't have the must-have title that's going to be out at launch.

435
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:46,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably the coolest stuff that's coming out at launch is the Street Fighter game, the Dead or Alive game maybe, and maybe Nintendogs and Cats if that's what you're into.

436
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,857
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's kind of a stretch for a must-have launch title.

437
00:36:50,538 --> 00:36:52,139
[SPEAKER_09]: That Kid Icarus game didn't make it.

438
00:36:53,321 --> 00:36:55,903
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't heard of the Zelda remake or any of that.

439
00:36:56,104 --> 00:36:58,947
[SPEAKER_09]: None of that kind of made the launch, so I don't know.

440
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:02,544
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys in our chat room think?

441
00:37:02,564 --> 00:37:15,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.orangeonsradio.com Well, I was going to say, actually, it does seem like that they're like, well, either we wait and put everything out together or we at least get the system out, get some early sales going on.

442
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:20,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once everyone sees what else is on the eShop, then we get another boost in sales come May.

443
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:22,752
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sort of what I'm seeing of.

444
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw a lot of that happening at PAX East last year when I went.

445
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator says, I'm a bit paranoid about taking portable stuff out and about, if only because I live in a rough neighborhood and I don't want to be jumped and robbed.

446
00:37:45,169 --> 00:37:46,610
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually not a bad point.

447
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everybody's going to want to find the players near them.

448
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:50,433
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

449
00:37:50,454 --> 00:37:51,995
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be a little scary.

450
00:37:54,177 --> 00:37:56,378
[SPEAKER_09]: And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this name incorrectly.

451
00:37:56,919 --> 00:38:04,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Nipros says, it does seem Netflix has Ren and Stimpy.

452
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:06,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we were wondering that earlier.

453
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:07,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for checking.

454
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:08,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate that.

455
00:38:09,669 --> 00:38:10,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to know.

456
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:21,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, the other thing, too, is that something like that actually might work in Japan, because you remember with all the stuff that was happening with Monster Hunter, you know, that was such a big thing, and people would just randomly challenge it.

457
00:38:21,992 --> 00:38:30,437
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nintendogs thing, you know, that's something that I think would happen more often in Japan, but not so much here, you know.

458
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:33,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, years ago, the barcode scanner.

459
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:41,864
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got people that are more into it who will go to the cons and just walk through the street.

460
00:38:41,924 --> 00:38:43,685
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I forgot about that game.

461
00:38:43,725 --> 00:38:47,288
[SPEAKER_09]: There was some type of battle game that was battle barcodes or something.

462
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:48,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that.

463
00:38:48,168 --> 00:38:54,573
[SPEAKER_04]: And they sold out of this one brand of ramen or something because it created some uber monster.

464
00:38:54,953 --> 00:38:56,094
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was the CD one.

465
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:25,602
[SPEAKER_09]: what was the game that you put in your CD and you get a different monster based on the CD and you got like this great monster by using Madonna totally don't know but well now it would be too easy to just burn your own CD yeah because obviously it was measuring track length and number of tracks or something interesting hmm all right let's go to the next story then we'll chew on this 3DS news a little bit see what happens closer to launch mm-hmm

466
00:39:26,482 --> 00:39:28,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And now back to more Sony news.

467
00:39:29,123 --> 00:39:36,125
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about last week how the people figured out ways to load custom firmwares and stuff like that on their PS3.

468
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:40,026
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the first thing that happens when they do that?

469
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:45,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, release new PS3 firmware update, or this could even go for the PSP.

470
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:49,952
[SPEAKER_03]: and patch all that stuff out or at least try to break it.

471
00:39:50,553 --> 00:39:51,394
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what they did.

472
00:39:51,754 --> 00:39:54,197
[SPEAKER_03]: They released 3.56 firmware.

473
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:59,683
[SPEAKER_03]: It adds no functionality whatsoever other than a security patch.

474
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:05,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And it basically changed some of the keys on different things and...

475
00:40:07,645 --> 00:40:08,626
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

476
00:40:28,732 --> 00:40:32,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Other methods to, I guess, cheat the game.

477
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:38,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've permanently banned those people from playing Black Ops in multiplayer.

478
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, cheaters get smackdowned.

479
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:45,181
[SPEAKER_09]: You just think about that, future cheaters.

480
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:48,742
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one thing if you want to cheat amongst people you know.

481
00:40:49,622 --> 00:40:55,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care if you cheat in single player where you're not going online or any of that, or if you cheat with friends.

482
00:40:56,003 --> 00:41:01,064
[SPEAKER_09]: But going just to be power tripping in random online matches is a dick thing to do.

483
00:41:02,805 --> 00:41:04,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Dicks deserve to have dick things happen to them in return.

484
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:12,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And you remember how they were saying, oh, well, there's no way for us to possibly stop these guys from cheating on our games.

485
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:13,591
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way.

486
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:16,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, poor us, Activision.

487
00:41:16,713 --> 00:41:17,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I do remember that.

488
00:41:17,674 --> 00:41:18,174
[SPEAKER_09]: That was funny.

489
00:41:18,195 --> 00:41:20,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Weren't they trying to use that as an excuse or something?

490
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:24,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, now the excuse is out of the way, and hopefully they're going to fix everything.

491
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:30,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe there was a patch for the PS3 version as well to fix some stuff, but now it's not an excuse.

492
00:41:30,944 --> 00:41:31,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

493
00:41:33,254 --> 00:41:33,554
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

494
00:41:34,974 --> 00:41:39,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me move on to what's coming in a future PS3 update, if the rumors are to be believed.

495
00:41:39,976 --> 00:41:41,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would believe this, actually.

496
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:52,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, there are some folks in the development community that are getting notices from Sony saying that in firmware 3.60, cloud storage for saved games will be available.

497
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,960
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called online saving.

498
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,200
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not calling it cloud saving.

499
00:41:55,741 --> 00:41:57,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe make everybody think of Final Fantasy VII.

500
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:58,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

501
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:00,002
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're calling it online saving.

502
00:42:00,682 --> 00:42:04,146
[SPEAKER_09]: This means that you could actually save files on a remote server.

503
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:10,271
[SPEAKER_09]: So that way, if I'm playing a game at home, I could save to the online save and then access this at my friend's house.

504
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:11,032
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be kind of cool.

505
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:12,514
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

506
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:18,840
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, this feature will only be available, of course, to PlayStation Plus subscribers.

507
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha ha.

508
00:42:21,061 --> 00:42:21,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

509
00:42:21,902 --> 00:42:23,403
[SPEAKER_09]: And this doesn't surprise me at all.

510
00:42:23,443 --> 00:42:27,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I seem to remember when they first announced the PlayStation Plus that this was one of the features they were touting.

511
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:31,368
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not too surprising this is finally coming out.

512
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:32,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of a neat idea.

513
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,691
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I kind of like that idea.

514
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:45,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you go to your friends' houses and sometimes forget your save files or hauling the memory cards around is too big of a bitch or whatever, you know, or you forget, then it's a neat idea.

515
00:42:45,478 --> 00:42:49,901
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of wish Microsoft had one too that didn't involve save cards.

516
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:52,222
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I think it's neat.

517
00:42:52,662 --> 00:42:53,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, is this a feature you'd use?

518
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anyone in here uses PlayStation Plus right now.

519
00:42:57,365 --> 00:42:59,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this something that might make you want to get it?

520
00:43:00,087 --> 00:43:00,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

521
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:00,927
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

522
00:43:00,987 --> 00:43:01,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

523
00:43:01,988 --> 00:43:08,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'll never take my game saves anywhere other than, you know, on my PS3.

524
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:13,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I really was, you know, aching to do that, I can just throw it on a jump drive.

525
00:43:15,056 --> 00:43:16,837
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, anything that would interest you?

526
00:43:17,702 --> 00:43:18,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a neat idea.

527
00:43:18,623 --> 00:43:25,528
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun concept, but I'd have to see it more in practice before I make a judgment on it, honestly.

528
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:31,373
[SPEAKER_09]: This would have been perfect in the college dorm where everybody had a video game system and you're going from room to room.

529
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:34,055
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been great.

530
00:43:34,295 --> 00:43:37,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that would have been cool back in the DDR edit days.

531
00:43:39,602 --> 00:43:39,882
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.

532
00:43:55,625 --> 00:44:22,531
[SPEAKER_09]: and the mom was all over the media saying he's autistic and he's just really good at games and Microsoft's like no we caught him cheating he's banned from the network just like anybody else would be and turns out it came to light yes he was doing that whole save file exploit thing where he can unlock achievements from opening up a save file and so yeah I don't care if you're autistic if you cheat you're a cheater and you should be dealt with appropriately that has nothing to do with the end result

533
00:44:23,636 --> 00:44:24,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally agree.

534
00:44:25,158 --> 00:44:33,686
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter the color of your skin, the sexuality, any type of handicap you might have, physical, mental, cheating is cheating.

535
00:44:34,427 --> 00:44:34,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Period.

536
00:44:35,468 --> 00:44:35,968
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

537
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,531
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a little silly.

538
00:44:40,452 --> 00:44:57,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how when someone with a disability or some persecuted group will just come right out and say, oh, well, you're doing it because of this, this, and this.

539
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,745
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you wanted to be treated like everybody else, right?

540
00:45:02,206 --> 00:45:03,807
[SPEAKER_09]: How far do I want to go with this?

541
00:45:03,887 --> 00:45:05,608
[SPEAKER_09]: How controversial do I want to be on the show?

542
00:45:06,187 --> 00:45:10,809
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a difference between actually singling somebody out and then treating somebody like everybody else.

543
00:45:11,029 --> 00:45:11,289
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

544
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:15,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you guys remember there was that burger joint in town that was very popular?

545
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:16,771
[SPEAKER_09]: It was all over the Food Network shows.

546
00:45:17,111 --> 00:45:27,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And they ended up getting sued by the American Disability Association or whatever because apparently the place was called the Squeeze Inn.

547
00:45:27,815 --> 00:45:32,957
[SPEAKER_09]: And it kind of made its whole little reputation off of being packed and crowded all of the time.

548
00:45:33,737 --> 00:45:45,965
[SPEAKER_09]: and some folks sued them based on disability needs and the damn place almost closed that's ridiculous and I kind of I agree and here's the thing well technically it did close it did close and had to reopen in a new location

549
00:45:46,846 --> 00:46:06,168
[SPEAKER_09]: but they and this is important to say all you had to do was to honk your horn outside the restaurant and they would have served you whatever I mean they they you did not have to actually go into the restaurant so I don't think anyone was like totally being discriminated against or what have you you know it just it just kind of struck me as you know ruining it for everyone I don't know

550
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:07,734
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I agree.

551
00:46:08,894 --> 00:46:09,435
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a mess.

552
00:46:09,535 --> 00:46:13,939
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the same time, that place never got more publicity than when that whole thing happened.

553
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:15,460
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

554
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,601
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't care.

555
00:46:18,802 --> 00:46:19,103
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

556
00:46:19,723 --> 00:46:20,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

557
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:20,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to the chat room.

558
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:23,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Spazinator in our chat room says, I agree.

559
00:46:33,718 --> 00:46:34,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a good one.

560
00:46:34,978 --> 00:46:37,659
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta read this comment from Derek H. Maybe lighten the mood a little bit too.

561
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:41,280
[SPEAKER_09]: At our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com, Derek H. says, Confirmed.

562
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob says it's okay to cheat with friends.

563
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of bored housewives share the same philosophy.

564
00:46:47,781 --> 00:46:50,062
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you saying that the mailman is a friend?

565
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:52,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure quite what you're saying there.

566
00:46:52,582 --> 00:46:52,842
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

567
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you're fucking him, he is.

568
00:46:56,884 --> 00:46:57,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you know what I meant.

569
00:46:58,807 --> 00:47:03,475
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay if you're a bored housewife cheating in... What would bored housewives play?

570
00:47:03,555 --> 00:47:04,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy XI?

571
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:05,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Bunko.

572
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:06,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Bunko.

573
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:08,304
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're all cheating in Bunko, you have...

574
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:12,396
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

575
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:36,909
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a house rule.

576
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:37,750
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a house rule.

577
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:38,550
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a rule.

578
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,330
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cheating.

579
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:40,411
[SPEAKER_09]: You're cheating.

580
00:47:41,071 --> 00:47:43,952
[SPEAKER_09]: But you agree to house rules because it's kind of how you play with friends, right?

581
00:47:44,892 --> 00:47:46,413
[SPEAKER_09]: So, anyhow.

582
00:47:48,614 --> 00:47:49,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

583
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:50,855
[SPEAKER_09]: More stories, Loki.

584
00:47:53,427 --> 00:47:59,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this is kind of more about the whole firmware updates and whatnot.

585
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:00,770
[SPEAKER_03]: It ties in all that.

586
00:48:01,611 --> 00:48:07,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony, of course, was granted a temporary restraining order against Geohot.

587
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:09,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically...

588
00:48:11,095 --> 00:48:11,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching.

589
00:48:33,989 --> 00:48:50,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Obtained by hacking the PS3 and more to the point, he can no longer engage in acts of circumvention of the TPMS in the PS3 system to access, obtain, remove, or traffic in copyrighted works, which I don't think he was doing anyways.

590
00:48:51,135 --> 00:49:14,626
[SPEAKER_03]: and then of course there's still issues about the whole jurisdiction issues since of course he resides in a different state than Sony and a different state from where the claim was filed and they're saying that because he purposefully directed his activities at the Forum State of California they're letting it go through

591
00:49:15,847 --> 00:49:29,447
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of, that's not a good precedent to be setting by the courts, saying, oh, well, because you conducted yourself on a website that was located in California, we can try you in California.

592
00:49:32,205 --> 00:49:38,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody who uses Facebook or Twitter or whatever can be tried in California, no matter where you are in the world, I guess.

593
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I find this comment from our chatroom interesting.

594
00:49:40,912 --> 00:49:42,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to ask Loki about it here.

595
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:43,274
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from Napreos.

596
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:44,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I finally figured out how to pronounce the name.

597
00:49:44,955 --> 00:49:46,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Napreos says, FGO hot.

598
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:47,457
[SPEAKER_09]: He deserves it.

599
00:49:47,557 --> 00:49:48,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Cocky bastard.

600
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:51,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I haven't really seen this guy in action.

601
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I realize he's been in the media and so forth, but is that a legitimate claim?

602
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:55,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Is he really cocky?

603
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:57,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Did he kind of have it coming to him?

604
00:49:57,725 --> 00:49:58,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he's cocky, but...

605
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:04,071
[SPEAKER_03]: It all comes down to... I mean, this is just part of the discovery phase of the whole trial.

606
00:50:04,812 --> 00:50:08,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like Sony is getting his equipment.

607
00:50:08,876 --> 00:50:18,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they'll have access to it along with the lawyers to kind of make sure no funny business is going on, but it's not like this stuff gets shipped to Sony.

608
00:50:19,406 --> 00:50:20,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And even still...

609
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:22,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

610
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:59,206
[SPEAKER_03]: um and they've actually gone and they've been um doing ceases and desists on different um websites hosting files and whatnot but now people have kind of diverted that stuff to um a file hosting place off sea you know in other countries so they can't be touched I guess

611
00:50:59,486 --> 00:51:01,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me play devil's advocate here for a minute.

612
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:17,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that I necessarily feel this way, but wouldn't that sort of be the equivalent of you shut down a file sharing site such as Pirate Bay or whatever because they're enabling people to facilitate illegal downloads.

613
00:51:17,415 --> 00:51:22,017
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not posting the illegal downloads themselves, but because they facilitate it, they're the ones that get in trouble.

614
00:51:22,677 --> 00:51:30,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that makes sense if you're basically... If he was releasing the backup creator for it.

615
00:51:30,763 --> 00:51:34,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this could be used for legitimate backups, but some people might not use it for that.

616
00:51:34,826 --> 00:51:35,927
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what he's doing at all.

617
00:51:36,267 --> 00:51:42,332
[SPEAKER_03]: This is basically saying... I guess it would be the equivalent of... I don't know...

618
00:51:44,818 --> 00:52:09,773
[SPEAKER_03]: A car salesman handing you the keys to a car And you go hit someone with that car They're enabling you to get in that car And murder someone with that car So they should be held liable for it That's basically what the equivalent of it is Dealerships actually do have liability Against that type of thing It's retarded I understand that they may get away with that In the laws of the United States Because it's absolutely retarded But people can sue and win for hot coffee It's

619
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:24,178
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, he posted stuff, and I'm sure they don't want people giving them backdoor access to the entire PS3.

620
00:52:25,118 --> 00:52:32,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he's done, yes, may eventually lead to piracy or easier piracy on PlayStation 3 because...

621
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:43,843
[SPEAKER_03]: These tools allow people to run unsigned code and people can create unsigned programs for piracy purposes, but also they can create code for other things.

622
00:52:45,303 --> 00:52:52,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not necessarily that he's directly responsible for it, but yes, he plays a part of that, I guess.

623
00:52:53,185 --> 00:52:56,526
[SPEAKER_03]: But once again, this court case isn't about necessarily...

624
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:05,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, and this is a great comment from Bob Coffey in our chatroom here.

625
00:53:05,971 --> 00:53:07,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Hackers aren't cheaters.

626
00:53:07,231 --> 00:53:08,591
[SPEAKER_09]: The trial isn't about hacking.

627
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:13,013
[SPEAKER_09]: The trial is about your rights as a consumer, not about CFW or any shit at that.

628
00:53:13,293 --> 00:53:19,254
[SPEAKER_09]: The real precedent this may set is, do you own the computing product you buy or is it a licensed product?

629
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:22,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting note to end it on.

630
00:53:22,342 --> 00:53:23,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we'll see what develops with this.

631
00:53:42,702 --> 00:53:45,924
[SPEAKER_03]: To prove that he did all this stuff, or he's actually doing it.

632
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:49,165
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is that Sony's claiming all these things that obviously aren't true.

633
00:53:49,585 --> 00:53:53,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're saying, oh yes, he's pirating stuff, or he's enabling people to pirate stuff.

634
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:58,470
[SPEAKER_03]: When they initially made that statement, that was not the case.

635
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:04,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it may be the case, because now there's the ability to do that, but it wasn't anything he did.

636
00:54:05,113 --> 00:54:07,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, it...

637
00:54:09,887 --> 00:54:32,572
[SPEAKER_03]: it's difficult to it all depends on how intelligent the court the judges and stuff like that whether she's going to buy into this retarded nonsense alright well we will see what develops I'm sure we have not said the last on this so let's go ahead and move on to some release dates and travel the world and see what is coming out in a video game store near you this week

638
00:54:34,192 --> 00:54:35,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a whole lot this week, actually.

639
00:54:36,213 --> 00:54:37,794
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty sad.

640
00:54:38,434 --> 00:54:40,855
[SPEAKER_03]: But there will be some better stuff in the upcoming month.

641
00:54:41,575 --> 00:54:45,056
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, they've got a track pack for Rock Band.

642
00:54:45,856 --> 00:54:53,839
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're missing out on some country music, there's a second country track pack coming out this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

643
00:54:53,859 --> 00:54:53,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

644
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:58,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

645
00:54:59,194 --> 00:55:01,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other smaller games.

646
00:55:01,755 --> 00:55:05,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Junior Brain Trainer 2 is making its way out on DS.

647
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:08,018
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sims 3 Outdoor Living.

648
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,799
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of an expansion pack for The Sims 3 that's coming out on PC.

649
00:55:16,254 --> 00:55:16,834
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

650
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:19,875
[SPEAKER_03]: On PC, they have a game called The Ball.

651
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:23,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently someone took my advice and made a game about ball.

652
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:25,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

653
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,559
[SPEAKER_03]: That is coming out on PC.

654
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:38,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, a week from today, sort of, Mario Sports Mix will be out on the Wii.

655
00:55:40,723 --> 00:55:41,084
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it?

656
00:55:42,104 --> 00:55:42,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

657
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:43,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

658
00:55:43,983 --> 00:55:46,085
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really, really dead week.

659
00:55:46,646 --> 00:55:47,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a reason for that?

660
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that just because of the 3DS?

661
00:55:48,669 --> 00:55:51,873
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not yet into the middle of February.

662
00:55:51,894 --> 00:55:53,516
[SPEAKER_03]: February is a pretty light month.

663
00:55:53,656 --> 00:55:57,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's more games than there would be in January, but it's not March.

664
00:55:59,043 --> 00:56:02,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well let's move on and look at Japan and what they've got coming out.

665
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:04,108
[SPEAKER_09]: And I gotta tell you, it's kind of the same thing.

666
00:56:04,148 --> 00:56:05,249
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have a whole lot coming out.

667
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:06,971
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a couple things to note.

668
00:56:07,151 --> 00:56:10,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Dodonpachi Daifukutsu Black Label comes out.

669
00:56:10,775 --> 00:56:13,237
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a cave shooter coming out on the Xbox 360.

670
00:56:13,277 --> 00:56:16,340
[SPEAKER_09]: That is coming out on February the 3rd.

671
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:21,486
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, because they get a lot of those shooters over there where it's just pretty much...

672
00:56:22,006 --> 00:56:28,070
[SPEAKER_09]: That little center of the screen getting taken up with a shooter, but quite an audience for the shmups over here, too.

673
00:56:28,871 --> 00:56:29,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can check that out.

674
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:35,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 gets its localized edition on the Xbox 360 this week.

675
00:56:36,035 --> 00:56:39,938
[SPEAKER_09]: That is also coming out on the PlayStation 3, and that's the only PS3 release this week in Japan.

676
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:43,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to the Nintendo Wii real quick.

677
00:56:44,521 --> 00:56:44,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing.

678
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:51,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Things are dying down on the Nintendo front, of course, because of the 3DS's impending release on February 26th over there.

679
00:56:52,866 --> 00:56:55,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Although the Nintendo DS does have a couple things to note.

680
00:56:55,988 --> 00:57:00,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon Ball Ultimate Butoh Tuden comes out this week from Namco Bandai.

681
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:04,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Gyakuten Kenji 2 comes out this week.

682
00:57:04,831 --> 00:57:07,652
[SPEAKER_09]: That is in a regular and a limited edition.

683
00:57:07,712 --> 00:57:08,793
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out from Capcom.

684
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:11,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that is a Phoenix Wright spin-off game.

685
00:57:13,635 --> 00:57:14,535
[SPEAKER_09]: That comes out this week.

686
00:57:15,836 --> 00:57:18,037
[SPEAKER_09]: It definitely has some of the same characters from that series.

687
00:57:19,057 --> 00:57:27,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this looks to be a little more like walking around adventure-y type of game, but I'm sure still the whole courtroom scenes and objections that you know and love.

688
00:57:29,126 --> 00:57:33,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on quickly to the PSP, there's a release on there that some folks might be interested in.

689
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:37,233
[SPEAKER_09]: White Knight Chronicles Episode Portable, Dogma Wars, comes out this week.

690
00:57:37,273 --> 00:57:40,996
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an official Sony product from Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan this week.

691
00:57:41,497 --> 00:57:45,300
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be interesting to see what they improved on in the PS3 version, if anything.

692
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Also on the PSP, Macross Triangle Frontier.

693
00:57:49,701 --> 00:57:51,401
[SPEAKER_09]: And that does it for your Japanese releases.

694
00:57:51,421 --> 00:57:52,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, that's a Macross Frontier game?

695
00:57:53,302 --> 00:57:54,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Macross Triangle Frontier.

696
00:57:55,162 --> 00:57:59,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see, because Macross Frontier is the... Yeah, that's for the new one that came out.

697
00:57:59,484 --> 00:58:00,544
[SPEAKER_04]: The new series that was out.

698
00:58:01,384 --> 00:58:03,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Which Dan and I watched all the way through.

699
00:58:03,885 --> 00:58:04,725
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good.

700
00:58:05,605 --> 00:58:06,765
[SPEAKER_04]: So this looks really cool.

701
00:58:06,805 --> 00:58:08,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks kind of like a 3D shooter game.

702
00:58:09,646 --> 00:58:30,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like a typical shmup, more like a polygony shmup game We're big fans of the Macross games, I bet it's a lot like the VFR games Actually, we've got Macross M3 for Dreamcast, which is a really good game So yeah, I love the Macross games Was that Japan?

703
00:58:31,075 --> 00:59:00,446
[SPEAKER_04]: that's it for Japan in the UK on February 2nd we have Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 we have long cookies on the 4th we have Earthrise Lord of Arcana Mario vs. Donkey Kong Miniland Mayhem Nailed Sega Mega Drive Classics Volume 4 and Two Worlds 2 that's it alright

704
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:05,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on with some more stories in the Classic Game of the Week.

705
00:59:06,016 --> 00:59:06,517
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just ahead.

706
00:59:07,237 --> 00:59:14,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's more ridiculous, the whole lawsuit that this company is facing or the name of this game.

707
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:19,205
[SPEAKER_03]: But Facebook game Blingville is getting the cease and desist from Zynga.

708
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:25,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently Zynga believes that they own the rights to the use of Ville in any product.

709
00:59:25,389 --> 00:59:26,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's out there.

710
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:29,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Gosh, what are you, the new monster cables?

711
00:59:29,472 --> 00:59:30,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

712
00:59:30,773 --> 00:59:35,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start suing everybody for using Ville, or Doodle, or Monster.

713
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:44,347
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently, they have sent a cease and desist to Blingville LLC.

714
00:59:44,687 --> 00:59:47,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a unique company name, I suppose.

715
00:59:48,551 --> 00:59:50,753
[SPEAKER_03]: The creators of the Facebook game, of course, that

716
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:51,774
[SPEAKER_03]: has the same name.

717
00:59:51,995 --> 01:00:01,288
[SPEAKER_03]: According to Zynga, the use of vil in the game and the company's moniker infringes on its own collection of social gaming trademarks.

718
01:00:01,448 --> 01:00:07,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Blingvil, of course, not associated with Zynga in any way.

719
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:08,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

720
01:00:31,582 --> 01:00:33,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Bress Lowell's comment in our chat room.

721
01:00:33,824 --> 01:00:34,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Cruella DeVille?

722
01:00:35,766 --> 01:00:37,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Will they be suing Disney?

723
01:00:37,928 --> 01:00:39,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's possible.

724
01:00:41,151 --> 01:00:42,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, Zynga.

725
01:00:43,052 --> 01:00:45,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of find it to be a taste of their own medicine a little bit.

726
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't Farmville like a ripoff of Farmtown?

727
01:00:47,917 --> 01:00:49,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Which of those two came first?

728
01:00:49,338 --> 01:00:50,119
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Farmtown.

729
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, so, I mean, come on, Zynga.

730
01:00:53,325 --> 01:00:57,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, Zynga's, like, evil, okay, and that's all it comes down to.

731
01:00:57,707 --> 01:01:14,853
[SPEAKER_03]: People hate Zynga, like, they don't have any original content, it's just ripped off from stuff, and they just, now they're suing people out of the way, because they're, they may, you know, come in and start taking away some of the money that Farmville or Cityville or, I don't know, whatever...

732
01:01:15,794 --> 01:01:21,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because you have names of stuff that end with VIL does not mean all of a sudden you own the trademark to VIL.

733
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,962
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to sue Danville next.

734
01:01:23,402 --> 01:01:28,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the people that made Farm Town should sue them because they started farm games, honestly.

735
01:01:29,249 --> 01:01:30,611
[SPEAKER_09]: If that lawsuit didn't already happen.

736
01:01:30,951 --> 01:01:32,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm looking at Wikipedia.

737
01:01:32,152 --> 01:01:36,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know it's not a definitive resource, but it's a pretty good place to start researching.

738
01:01:36,714 --> 01:01:42,617
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do notice it says Farmville started as a clone of the popular Farm Town, which also featured on Facebook in June 2009.

739
01:01:42,997 --> 01:01:45,158
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are some citations for that.

740
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:46,679
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the other big Zynga game?

741
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:48,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't YoVille another big one?

742
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:50,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they even have that?

743
01:01:50,761 --> 01:01:51,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

744
01:01:51,382 --> 01:01:51,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see.

745
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:53,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that's what it was called.

746
01:01:53,462 --> 01:01:54,543
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see an article on that.

747
01:01:55,463 --> 01:01:57,784
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the other big Zynga games out there?

748
01:01:57,804 --> 01:01:59,044
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know if they were knockoffs too.

749
01:01:59,725 --> 01:02:00,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

750
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:01,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan plays that.

751
01:02:04,206 --> 01:02:04,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

752
01:02:04,706 --> 01:02:07,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to see if they have a list of games somewhere here.

753
01:02:07,107 --> 01:02:07,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, here we go.

754
01:02:07,547 --> 01:02:08,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Mafia Wars.

755
01:02:08,327 --> 01:02:09,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that a knockoff of a game too?

756
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:33,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is very exciting radio yeah the makers of a similar online game Mob Wars sued Zynga over the launch of Mafia Wars accusing them of copyright infringement Frontierville that's the other big one too that's the one I always see on my stupid wall I don't think that was necessarily a rip off of anything though interesting

757
01:02:35,183 --> 01:02:35,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

758
01:02:36,263 --> 01:02:38,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think all of those Bill games are a waste of time.

759
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:45,826
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I would sit here and criticize it, but then, again, I can't stop playing that stupid Knights of the Clicky, or what is it really called?

760
01:02:45,886 --> 01:02:48,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Knights of the Crystal is the real name of the game.

761
01:02:48,847 --> 01:02:49,908
[SPEAKER_09]: That Square Enix one.

762
01:02:50,268 --> 01:02:51,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't stop playing it.

763
01:02:51,428 --> 01:02:53,889
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the dumbest game ever, but I just keep clicking.

764
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:55,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Click, click, click.

765
01:02:55,789 --> 01:02:56,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep doing quests.

766
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:59,231
[SPEAKER_09]: The artwork's really good, at least I can say that.

767
01:02:59,331 --> 01:02:59,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Get away with that.

768
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:02,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Portal 2 is coming out on the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360

769
01:03:22,354 --> 01:03:27,478
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be a lot of cool stuff on the PC version as well, including mod tools.

770
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:30,220
[SPEAKER_09]: What is a Valve game that doesn't have some mod tools available for it?

771
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Some mod tools will be available on the PC version of Portal 2.

772
01:03:35,063 --> 01:03:40,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, that content is not going to be available on the 360 or the PS3, meaning the mod tools.

773
01:03:41,207 --> 01:03:51,854
[SPEAKER_09]: However, what they're saying, and this is a quote from Chet Felizik, who is from Valve, saying, the content that comes out is agnostic, and so we will be seeing that on all platforms.

774
01:03:52,234 --> 01:03:52,634
[SPEAKER_09]: and many more.

775
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:37,402
[SPEAKER_09]: by the way, they are also saying that each of the game's two campaign modes will have individual surprise rewards when you beat them, so single player has one reward co-op has another there are two sets of credits and two sets of endings interesting, so if you really want to get the full game, you're going to have to play single and you're going to have to play co-op that should be very interesting

776
01:04:38,578 --> 01:04:50,680
[SPEAKER_09]: there you go Portal 2 coming out whenever Valve's ready I know there's a release date out there somewhere but I refuse to believe anything final until the game is actually out on shelves if you need something to play in the meantime how about the classic game of the week

777
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:59,564
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a chance for DarkSakura to dive into the gaming vault and pick a game that she thinks, hey, you kids ought to be playing this.

778
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,244
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a true classic game.

779
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:06,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of all this newfangled Farmville crap, and I mean crap.

780
01:05:07,206 --> 01:05:08,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Get off my lawn.

781
01:05:08,846 --> 01:05:10,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Go play this game instead and get off my lawn.

782
01:05:11,887 --> 01:05:13,067
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, what is the classic game of the week?

783
01:05:13,087 --> 01:05:13,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull up your pants.

784
01:05:14,548 --> 01:05:15,948
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?

785
01:05:16,028 --> 01:05:19,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the chat room will be able to tell the moment the music plays.

786
01:05:19,529 --> 01:05:21,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then let me pull up the little music here and...

787
01:05:22,768 --> 01:05:27,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And whoever guesses first in the chatroom, I'm looking, gets a no prize.

788
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:31,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm looking at you, chatroom.

789
01:05:37,878 --> 01:05:40,181
[SPEAKER_09]: They're on a minute delay, so you might want to see it for a little bit.

790
01:05:40,422 --> 01:05:40,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

791
01:05:41,443 --> 01:05:46,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it is Final Fantasy VI, or as we got it over here, Final Fantasy III.

792
01:05:47,812 --> 01:05:51,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is one of my all-time favorite games because of this music.

793
01:05:51,737 --> 01:05:52,638
[SPEAKER_04]: This music is epic.

794
01:05:52,678 --> 01:05:53,780
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me want to climb a mountain.

795
01:05:55,021 --> 01:05:58,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, had a great, great, great story.

796
01:05:58,644 --> 01:06:05,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Had really amazing classic scenes, like the opera house, which of course everyone knows.

797
01:06:06,669 --> 01:06:14,074
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the great, you know, this whole music plays when they're in their little, um, machine walker things.

798
01:06:14,154 --> 01:06:15,855
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bolchikawa gets the no prize, by the way.

799
01:06:17,456 --> 01:06:18,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was just amazing.

800
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:27,331
[SPEAKER_04]: This game came out in 1994 in Japan, and then it came out in 1999 on the PlayStation.

801
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:34,721
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing, like I've said a bunch of times.

802
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:44,068
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually sort of based about the second Industrial Revolution, meaning that it's got the sort of technical aspects into the game.

803
01:06:44,748 --> 01:06:56,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Character designs were done by Yoshitaka Amano, and he did pretty much everything with that game as far as the character designs and whatnot.

804
01:06:57,357 --> 01:07:07,321
[SPEAKER_04]: and, well, actually also he and Yoshinori Kitase and then, of course, the composer for the music was Nobuo Uematsu.

805
01:07:07,762 --> 01:07:08,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was really good.

806
01:07:11,003 --> 01:07:17,826
[SPEAKER_04]: It had, you know, random encounters and you had chocobos in your airship and it was just everything that one expects to be in a Final Fantasy game.

807
01:07:18,308 --> 01:07:20,069
[SPEAKER_04]: You had an active time battle system.

808
01:07:20,289 --> 01:07:22,391
[SPEAKER_04]: You had four players per party.

809
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:29,175
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could also change your main person walking around, I think, by hitting one of the shoulder buttons.

810
01:07:29,976 --> 01:07:30,716
[SPEAKER_04]: You had your thief.

811
01:07:30,756 --> 01:07:34,519
[SPEAKER_04]: You had the runic ability, which was absorbing magic attacks until the next turn.

812
01:07:34,539 --> 01:07:35,600
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Selly's.

813
01:07:37,301 --> 01:07:38,642
[SPEAKER_04]: All kinds of different stuff.

814
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:45,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you had your special hidden characters like Gal, who was the monster mimic.

815
01:07:46,827 --> 01:07:47,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And you had...

816
01:07:49,409 --> 01:07:50,430
[SPEAKER_04]: A Moogle.

817
01:07:52,232 --> 01:07:55,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Who, um... God, why can't I remember Moogle's name?

818
01:07:55,555 --> 01:07:55,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

819
01:07:56,436 --> 01:07:57,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Mog, yes, thank you, it was Mog.

820
01:07:57,898 --> 01:07:59,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, because, Mog House.

821
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

822
01:08:00,901 --> 01:08:04,664
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, um... And he had dances, which was always really fun.

823
01:08:05,805 --> 01:08:07,627
[SPEAKER_04]: The dude, it was all about Realm.

824
01:08:08,228 --> 01:08:09,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Who had the drawing attack.

825
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:11,511
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really sick.

826
01:08:11,551 --> 01:08:11,952
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway...

827
01:08:13,127 --> 01:08:16,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it had all kinds of neat stuff.

828
01:08:16,549 --> 01:08:18,630
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very steampunk-y in ways, too.

829
01:08:19,151 --> 01:08:21,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Combining technology and magic.

830
01:08:21,212 --> 01:08:28,096
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had the most insane bad guy ever, Kefka, who just had this funny, funny laugh.

831
01:08:31,517 --> 01:08:32,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

832
01:08:32,938 --> 01:08:34,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and don't forget the man.

833
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,740
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can find the music, Rob, you should play it.

834
01:08:37,341 --> 01:08:37,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadow.

835
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:39,422
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can find it.

836
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,411
[SPEAKER_04]: because he was freaking amazing.

837
01:08:45,953 --> 01:08:50,655
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it actually had alterations made in some of the character sprites.

838
01:08:50,895 --> 01:08:59,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, there was this one character who you could see her naked butt, and they covered her butt up.

839
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:07,502
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some of the item names were changed here and there, especially for the PlayStation release.

840
01:09:08,903 --> 01:09:09,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, you found it.

841
01:09:11,024 --> 01:09:12,965
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also the good music in the game.

842
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:19,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn it up a little bit, Robin.

843
01:09:19,508 --> 01:09:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you say?

844
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:30,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan said he would slit his mama's throat for... I know, but I forgot the line.

845
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:35,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't Shadow... Like, wasn't the whole thing that Shadow's a chick?

846
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:36,053
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

847
01:09:36,294 --> 01:09:38,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought... Isn't Shadow supposed to be, like, Realm's mom or something?

848
01:09:39,695 --> 01:09:40,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Realm's father.

849
01:09:40,495 --> 01:09:40,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

850
01:09:40,755 --> 01:09:40,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

851
01:09:42,483 --> 01:09:50,082
[SPEAKER_09]: hinted at but never confirmed Dan's talking off mic that'll be confirmed in Final Fantasy 6 too when Square gets around to making that

852
01:09:50,788 --> 01:09:58,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, and keep in mind, you know, they used the characters from this for doing the Nintendo 64 demo, remember?

853
01:09:59,615 --> 01:10:02,737
[SPEAKER_04]: When they were going to put Final Fantasy 7 on the Nintendo 64.

854
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:07,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Which the demo is kind of weird looking, but it was neat at the same time.

855
01:10:07,421 --> 01:10:11,764
[SPEAKER_04]: But this was seriously, I think it has to be one of the highlights of the series.

856
01:10:12,365 --> 01:10:13,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely one of the highlights of the series.

857
01:10:14,927 --> 01:10:17,629
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also discussion about it being remade for the 3DS version.

858
01:10:20,071 --> 01:10:20,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's pretty cool.

859
01:10:20,992 --> 01:10:22,374
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be neat.

860
01:10:23,816 --> 01:10:25,398
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there we go.

861
01:10:26,752 --> 01:10:29,855
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is, folks, your classic game of the week, Final Fantasy VI.

862
01:10:31,236 --> 01:10:33,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Or as you might call it, it's so good, it's Final Fantasy VI.

863
01:10:34,179 --> 01:10:34,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it's up to you.

864
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:38,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's going to do it for Part A tonight of Orange Lounge Radio.

865
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:39,303
[SPEAKER_09]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

866
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:40,324
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not done with the show yet.

867
01:10:40,364 --> 01:10:41,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Part B is coming up.

868
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:42,686
[SPEAKER_09]: We have more news for you guys.

869
01:10:43,087 --> 01:10:46,310
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about an interesting funding program for independent video games.

870
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:46,930
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get into that.

871
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:52,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Some clarity on the next wave of 3DS games, including Kid Icarus and some other things.

872
01:10:53,275 --> 01:10:56,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Some developments in that whole Sarian.net thing.

873
01:10:56,457 --> 01:10:58,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember how you could play like King's Quest on your iPad?

874
01:10:58,598 --> 01:10:59,358
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some updates on that.

875
01:10:59,678 --> 01:11:02,400
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get into all that in Part B as well as your Twitter topics.

876
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,241
[SPEAKER_09]: So get them in at OLR on Twitter.

877
01:11:04,621 --> 01:11:09,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Your emails and much more when we come back of more of Orange Lounge Radio.

878
01:11:15,322 --> 01:11:17,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

879
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:25,036
[SPEAKER_09]: We are live on this Sunday, January the 30th of 2011 for the 399th episode of our show.

880
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:25,517
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

881
01:11:25,677 --> 01:11:29,362
[SPEAKER_09]: We hit a little bit of a milestone next week and then I get to start saying for a lot.

882
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:32,571
[SPEAKER_09]: No plans of ending anytime soon.

883
01:11:32,651 --> 01:11:38,293
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll still be here until, I don't know, one of us is hospitalized for a long time or something.

884
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I shouldn't say something like that.

885
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:40,614
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I hope nothing like that ever happens.

886
01:11:42,455 --> 01:11:44,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, we also have side projects.

887
01:11:44,556 --> 01:11:47,817
[SPEAKER_09]: This thing's been going on so long that now everybody wants to do their side project.

888
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:49,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everyone.

889
01:11:49,177 --> 01:11:49,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everyone.

890
01:11:49,778 --> 01:11:51,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Loki, your baby is your side project.

891
01:11:51,678 --> 01:11:54,779
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of... 18 years worth of side projects.

892
01:11:54,799 --> 01:11:55,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it wasn't.

893
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Josh, the... I don't know.

894
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:02,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to hear Nellie do a podcast about video games because she kind of hates them all.

895
01:12:02,702 --> 01:12:04,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she's like, I have to always stay here and watch the baby.

896
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, well, you can go do the show.

897
01:12:06,263 --> 01:12:07,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll stay here and watch the baby.

898
01:12:07,283 --> 01:12:08,324
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, okay.

899
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:10,405
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be fun.

900
01:12:10,445 --> 01:12:12,366
[SPEAKER_09]: I think on April Fool's Day you should send Nellie over.

901
01:12:12,626 --> 01:12:14,087
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll make her read stories and everything.

902
01:12:14,127 --> 01:12:15,908
[SPEAKER_09]: She'll be like, I don't even know what this says.

903
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:16,909
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just words.

904
01:12:17,049 --> 01:12:17,510
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

905
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,891
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, what is this?

906
01:12:19,391 --> 01:12:20,632
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys care about this stuff?

907
01:12:20,652 --> 01:12:22,013
[SPEAKER_04]: She's welcome to bring Josh over.

908
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:23,654
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, yeah.

909
01:12:23,694 --> 01:12:25,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll watch the baby and she can read my stories.

910
01:12:26,256 --> 01:12:26,976
[SPEAKER_04]: He can't come over.

911
01:12:28,257 --> 01:12:28,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

912
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:29,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

913
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Other things to talk about that's going on.

914
01:12:33,401 --> 01:12:34,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Spinoff shows, side shows.

915
01:12:35,122 --> 01:12:37,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Sakura does a comic book one every week.

916
01:12:38,164 --> 01:12:38,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us about it.

917
01:12:39,031 --> 01:12:40,172
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Comic Insanity.

918
01:12:42,575 --> 01:12:46,759
[SPEAKER_04]: We basically just talk about what's coming out this week, every Wednesday.

919
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,282
[SPEAKER_04]: The show goes up on Tuesday, ideally.

920
01:12:51,183 --> 01:12:53,065
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about what we're reading, what we're looking forward to.

921
01:12:53,085 --> 01:12:57,369
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have a pick that all three of us are going to read, and then we also review different things that we've read.

922
01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:01,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, we all just read...

923
01:13:03,475 --> 01:13:24,583
[SPEAKER_04]: IDW's Infestation which I'll give our reviews on it I hated it and talked about other comics that we read and next week if you want to hear our review on a comic called Witchfinder then we will be reviewing that one next week

924
01:13:25,043 --> 01:13:31,366
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have an app for Android, so you can listen to episodes and tweet us.

925
01:13:31,446 --> 01:13:32,846
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our iPhone app coming soon.

926
01:13:32,926 --> 01:13:34,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Want to know our app for Android?

927
01:13:34,567 --> 01:13:35,147
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hey?

928
01:13:35,467 --> 01:13:37,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm working on this.

929
01:13:37,348 --> 01:13:37,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, all right.

930
01:13:38,068 --> 01:13:39,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know more about this.

931
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:41,490
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just found out about it.

932
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:42,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's fine.

933
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:47,352
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, and you can find us on Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net.

934
01:13:47,839 --> 01:13:48,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

935
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth.

936
01:13:51,622 --> 01:13:55,584
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want more Warcraft talk, and how could you possibly want more after this show?

937
01:13:55,704 --> 01:14:00,127
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there's a whole show I have with my pal Extifer that we talk about Warcraft.

938
01:14:00,427 --> 01:14:02,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't have a show this week, so I can't tell you what was going on.

939
01:14:02,869 --> 01:14:10,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Extifer had an emergency he had to deal with, so we didn't have a show this week, but we are going to be back next week talking about what's going on in the world of Warcraft.

940
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:19,041
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a new patch on the horizon that's likely to drop this week, so I'm sure there's going to be a lot of talk about some of the changes they make.

941
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:20,562
[SPEAKER_04]: They already put up a patch, didn't they?

942
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:22,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they patch that game all the time.

943
01:14:23,504 --> 01:14:27,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, because I upgraded to Cataclysm, and that's when mine patched.

944
01:14:27,448 --> 01:14:27,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

945
01:14:27,768 --> 01:14:29,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's the patch you're thinking of.

946
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:33,953
[SPEAKER_09]: But there is a new... It's the post-Cataclysm patch that fixes some of the problems.

947
01:14:33,973 --> 01:14:34,554
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fix the Arcane?

948
01:14:34,774 --> 01:14:35,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

949
01:14:35,295 --> 01:14:36,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know if I'd go that far.

950
01:14:38,217 --> 01:14:39,819
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll be talking about some of that next week on the show.

951
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:47,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Breslow would slap me in the face if I did not mention what's going on with USL Madness.

952
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:53,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Under Station Live's little tournament that they do where they try to find the best video game of all time.

953
01:14:53,456 --> 01:14:54,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Time, time, time, time.

954
01:14:55,492 --> 01:15:20,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Vote now, all the links are in our forums at OrangeLodgeRadio.com Which we know is going to win, and I know it's not on any of the lists But it's going to be a write-in winner, you watch Barbie Horse Adventures It's going to be a dark horse I'm not sure that there's a write-in thing you can do after the beginning But if there's a way to hack it, Loki will Loki will hack the results of USL Madness, just watch

955
01:15:21,664 --> 01:15:23,206
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll all be Barbie Horse Adventure.

956
01:15:41,425 --> 01:15:42,385
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

957
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:03,572
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, the Die in a Fire reference has made it into a video game.

958
01:16:04,332 --> 01:16:04,773
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

959
01:16:05,673 --> 01:16:10,997
[SPEAKER_09]: If it had said Die in a Boat Fire, then we'd know that they were listening to OLR, because I don't think you hear that expression anywhere else.

960
01:16:11,377 --> 01:16:15,700
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you have never heard Die in a Boat Fire before, DarkSakura's eating, so I'll have to explain it to you.

961
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, DarkSakura's gonna chew, chew, chew.

962
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:19,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Die in a Boat Fire.

963
01:16:21,103 --> 01:16:22,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would you tell someone to Die in a Boat Fire?

964
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:25,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it should actually be an oil tanker fire.

965
01:16:37,796 --> 01:16:40,018
[SPEAKER_04]: because then the water will be on fire too.

966
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,721
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the worst kind of fire.

967
01:16:43,001 --> 01:16:44,362
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, how do I put it out?

968
01:16:44,402 --> 01:16:45,563
[SPEAKER_03]: The water's on fire.

969
01:16:45,784 --> 01:16:46,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

970
01:16:46,284 --> 01:16:47,245
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just more fire.

[SPEAKER_09]: She was under the mattress the whole time.

[SPEAKER_03]: Click here to find her.

996
01:18:58,521 --> 01:19:06,768
[SPEAKER_03]: We had these giant posters in our computer lab with different country flags and stuff like that.

997
01:19:07,088 --> 01:19:09,691
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to know geography and stuff like that.

998
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:10,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know geography.

999
01:19:11,144 --> 01:19:12,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good at Oregon Trail.

1000
01:19:12,225 --> 01:19:13,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I can shoot animals.

1001
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:14,768
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1002
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:22,598
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I was always super good at wearing... Actually, I was really good at wearing timeless Carmen Sandiego because I am a big history nerd.

1003
01:19:23,018 --> 01:19:24,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been since I was a little kid.

1004
01:19:25,241 --> 01:19:26,222
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just a big nerd.

1005
01:19:26,482 --> 01:19:27,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have been since you were a little kid.

1006
01:19:28,845 --> 01:19:29,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and?

01:19:29,466 --> 01:19:30,127

[SPEAKER_04]: Here, drink this.

1010
01:19:57,672 --> 01:20:00,295
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know what's in it, but the snake oil lady said it would help.

1011
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:03,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't we get further expansions to the Oregon Trail?

1012
01:20:03,337 --> 01:20:04,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, zombies.

1013
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Zombies have attacked your party.

1014
01:20:07,822 --> 01:20:08,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon Trail 2.

1015
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:10,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck it, we're going back.

1016
01:20:13,246 --> 01:20:18,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Wagon's East, Chris Farley, John Candy, Canadian Bacon, Invading Canada

1017
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:31,932
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

1018
01:20:32,932 --> 01:20:45,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Japanese folks are getting their hands on Scribblenauts, and they're also getting their hands on a few additional characters and objects added in thanks to a translation from Konami.

1019
01:20:46,836 --> 01:20:54,639
[SPEAKER_03]: The Japanese version will feature some wonderful Konami staples, including Old Snake from Metal Gear Solid 4,

1020
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:02,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And where is Twinby?

1021
01:21:03,401 --> 01:21:04,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Where may I ask is Twinby?

1022
01:21:05,081 --> 01:21:05,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1023
01:21:06,222 --> 01:21:07,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Translation fail.

1024
01:21:07,222 --> 01:21:09,142
[SPEAKER_03]: These are just the screenshots that were posted.

1025
01:21:09,182 --> 01:21:10,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there are more things in there.

1026
01:21:10,563 --> 01:21:12,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe people haven't tried Twinby.

1027
01:21:12,043 --> 01:21:12,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, alright.

1028
01:21:12,903 --> 01:21:13,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

1029
01:21:13,323 --> 01:21:13,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So you never know.

1030
01:21:14,264 --> 01:21:15,184
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR machine.

1031
01:21:17,677 --> 01:21:23,659
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of cool, though, that since a different company kind of works with it in another country, it gets some extra Easter eggs.

1032
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:24,200
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of cool.

1033
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:30,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also rumored that if you type in failure, a version of Rock Revolution appears.

1034
01:21:32,243 --> 01:21:33,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Miserable failure.

1035
01:21:33,383 --> 01:21:34,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's a copy of Rock Revolution.

1036
01:21:38,188 --> 01:21:57,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to a financial quarterly report from Nintendo, a new Kirby sequel is coming from the developer HAL, and they have a teaser actually for it, and apparently it looks like a 3D Kirby game, just not all yarny.

1037
01:21:58,336 --> 01:22:03,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is going to be a more traditional Kirby game, but still pretty cool looking.

1038
01:22:04,478 --> 01:22:06,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Now with less yarn and more sucking.

1039
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:07,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1040
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:09,841
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a good thing when you're talking about Kirby.

1041
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:15,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Black and White are actually getting some PC connectivity.

1042
01:22:16,144 --> 01:22:27,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently using, of course, they also have the PokeWalker peripheral, which was from Heart and Gold, but that won't be used in Black and White at all.

1043
01:22:27,729 --> 01:22:29,850
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're going to have the Pokemon Global Link.

1044
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:33,992
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a website launching this spring, I guess shortly after the game is released.

1045
01:22:34,232 --> 01:22:40,917
[SPEAKER_03]: which allow players to sync their save files to an online profile giving them an access to a wide range of tools including

1046
01:22:43,508 --> 01:22:45,149
[SPEAKER_03]: to network with fellow trainers.

1047
01:22:45,989 --> 01:22:56,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, check their battle statistics, assigning them worldwide rankings and granting them eligibility to participate in live regional, national, and global tournaments.

1048
01:22:57,994 --> 01:23:05,637
[SPEAKER_03]: The site will host mini-games which let players collect Pokemon items which they can transfer back to their cartridges as well.

1049
01:23:06,478 --> 01:23:11,520
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll also let them sync a monster from their games to the website and explore their

1050
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:16,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Explore their dreams online Nerds

1051
01:23:18,371 --> 01:23:18,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1052
01:23:19,671 --> 01:23:25,692
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, let's see, last but not least, Rock Band, of course, having more stuff coming out this week.

1053
01:23:26,233 --> 01:23:30,673
[SPEAKER_03]: This week is actually going to be The Clash and their London Calling album.

1054
01:23:31,434 --> 01:23:42,956
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy the whole album for $20, or you can buy each individual track for $2 each, or whatever in your preferred console's space bucks.

1055
01:23:43,796 --> 01:24:04,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Includes tracks London Calling, Brand New Cadillac, Jimmy Jazz, Hateful, Rudy Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, The Right Profile, Lost in the Supermarket, Clampdown, The Guns of Brixton, Wrong and Boyo, Death and Glory, Coca-Cola, Card Cheat

1056
01:24:04,602 --> 01:24:08,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Lovers Rock, Four Horsemen, I'm Not Down, and Revolution Rock.

1057
01:24:08,866 --> 01:24:20,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, for it looks like London Calling, Rudy Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, Clampdown, and The Card Sheet.

1058
01:24:20,816 --> 01:24:27,161
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have the pro guitar and bass expansions available for an additional dollar if you're feeling like that.

1059
01:24:29,543 --> 01:24:31,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So look forward to that this week.

1060
01:24:34,168 --> 01:24:34,552
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1061
01:24:36,676 --> 01:24:40,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to some other stories, and we're going to start off with some news on Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1062
01:24:41,318 --> 01:24:49,841
[SPEAKER_09]: God, they have done such a good job keeping this game relevant, because they let a little bit of news out every week about some new characters that are in the game, so pretty cool.

1063
01:24:50,541 --> 01:25:02,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Sienko and Sentinel have been confirmed as characters that will be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, which is kind of funny, because I thought they had come out and said, no more Darkstalkers players, but yet it was a lie.

1064
01:25:02,626 --> 01:25:03,887
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yep, there it is.

1065
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:05,888
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be fun.

1066
01:25:06,068 --> 01:25:06,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1067
01:25:06,888 --> 01:25:07,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Sienko is pretty cool.

1068
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:10,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember I used Sienko all the time in Puzzle Fighter.

1069
01:25:13,112 --> 01:25:15,973
[SPEAKER_04]: She had a different name, I thought.

1070
01:25:16,514 --> 01:25:17,334
[SPEAKER_04]: No, in Puzzle Fighter.

1071
01:25:17,735 --> 01:25:20,136
[SPEAKER_04]: She was Lele and her sister was Mei Mei.

1072
01:25:21,351 --> 01:25:22,452
[SPEAKER_09]: What about Sentinel?

1073
01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:25,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you excited about these characters coming to MVC3, DarkSakura?

1074
01:25:26,297 --> 01:25:27,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Sentinel is badass.

1075
01:25:27,839 --> 01:25:31,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember playing the Sentinel in the old X-Men Children of the Atom.

1076
01:25:31,723 --> 01:25:33,625
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually talked about that this morning.

1077
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:37,410
[SPEAKER_04]: It came up in discussion on recording Comic Insanity.

1078
01:25:38,111 --> 01:25:38,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Plug, plug.

1083
01:26:21,323 --> 01:26:22,724
[SPEAKER_04]: You did say Gunstar Heroes, didn't you?

1084
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:50,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Gunstar Heroes was also recently released so I think that might be what is already there but there is now a new collection that I think has some of that stuff and new stuff as well I think those are all the sections with the old games let me see what is the new stuff here ah there we go Alien Soldier, Gunstar Heroes, Landstalker Light Crusader, Shining Force Shining Force 2, Streets of Rage Streets of Rage 2, Wonder Boy 3

1085

[SPEAKER_09]: QuakeCon

1086
01:27:00,273 --> 01:27:06,416
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's any fans of Quake in the house, QuakeCon 2011 is taking place August 4th through 7th this year.

1087
01:27:06,476 --> 01:27:10,438
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be in Dallas, Texas at the Hilton Anatol.

1088
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:14,480
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could also bring in your PC and play some Quake there.

1089
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:15,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Lan, have fun.

1090
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:18,522
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be interesting to see what they're going to announce at this.

1091
01:27:19,342 --> 01:27:26,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if there's maybe going to be some stuff on Rage, that whole new... Oh, I'm sure there will be.

1092
01:27:26,546 --> 01:27:28,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so take a look for that.

1093
01:27:29,127 --> 01:27:33,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, there's a brand new iPad and iPhone app for Pac-Man Battle Royale.

1094
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:34,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?

1095
01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:36,131
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the arcade game that's coming out soon.

1096
01:27:36,151 --> 01:27:41,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's actually like a little teaser or whatever you want to say that's available on the iPhone and the iPad.

1097
01:27:42,354 --> 01:27:45,936
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, I guess, like an actual first level of the game.

1098
01:27:46,196 --> 01:27:46,857
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of cool.

1099
01:27:47,337 --> 01:27:51,279
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can actually play that and then check it out in the arcades near you.

[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1101
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:21,619
[SPEAKER_09]: So who have they brought in?

1102
01:28:21,739 --> 01:28:23,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they've brought in Dan Licht.

1103
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:27,721
[SPEAKER_09]: He does Dexter, the music from Dexter on Showtime.

1104
01:28:27,841 --> 01:28:28,902
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if you know that show.

1105
01:28:29,782 --> 01:28:32,123
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually a little clip that's rolling around the internet.

1106
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:33,783
[SPEAKER_09]: We can play a little bit for you right now.

1107
01:28:35,404 --> 01:28:35,964
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I can try.

1108
01:28:35,984 --> 01:28:36,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

1109
01:28:43,044 --> 01:28:58,635
[SPEAKER_09]: See, it has an interesting sound to it, but to me it sounds a little more orchestra, whereas Akira Yamaoka felt a little more like dude in the basement banging random things together that made for an awesome soundtrack.

1110
01:28:58,675 --> 01:28:59,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how to explain it.

1111
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:04,646
[SPEAKER_04]: This sounds like he's actually trying to emulate Yamoga.

1112
01:29:04,666 --> 01:29:10,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because it's got some of the same, like the mandolin in the background.

1113
01:29:11,834 --> 01:29:14,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think he's trying to emulate Yamoga style.

1114
01:29:14,337 --> 01:29:14,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sure.

1115
01:29:14,778 --> 01:29:15,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody loved him.

1116
01:29:16,259 --> 01:29:19,463
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be interesting to see what this full thing looks like when it comes out.

1117
01:29:20,104 --> 01:29:22,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, you can't tell from just a minute and a half clip.

1118
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:26,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's going to do it for Rapid Fire News.

1119
01:29:26,176 --> 01:29:32,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move into some Twitter topics tonight and see what you guys are tweeting us at twitter.com slash OLR.

1120
01:29:34,366 --> 01:29:53,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Tweet, tweet, tweet Oh, a few tweets tonight Let's see, Spazinator wants to give us an update on what's going on in the video marketplace Not too much new in terms of freebies to announce aside from a preview episode of An Idiot Abroad on both PSN and XBL What the hell is An Idiot Abroad?

1121
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:58,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of that Surely that's not an anime Is that a reality show?

1122
01:30:00,819 --> 01:30:01,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of this before.

1123
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Wikipedia-ing it right now.

1124
01:30:05,481 --> 01:30:06,542
[SPEAKER_09]: An Idiot Abroad.

1125
01:30:07,342 --> 01:30:12,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, an entertainment travel documentary on Sky One and Science Channel.

1126
01:30:14,264 --> 01:30:16,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Starring Carl Plinkington.

1127
01:30:16,525 --> 01:30:17,886
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ricky Jervis is in it too.

1128
01:30:17,906 --> 01:30:19,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's pretty cool, I guess, if you're a fan of him.

1129
01:30:20,967 --> 01:30:21,748
[SPEAKER_09]: An idiot abroad.

1130
01:30:23,349 --> 01:30:23,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1131
01:30:23,929 --> 01:30:25,990
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt is tweeting us.

1132
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:28,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Resident hockey fan here with some game-related news.

1133
01:30:28,951 --> 01:30:34,534
[SPEAKER_09]: A minor league hockey team celebrates SNES NHL 94 style.

1134
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:35,635
[SPEAKER_09]: And he gives us a link there.

1135
01:30:36,455 --> 01:30:38,936
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's see here.

1136
01:30:39,556 --> 01:30:40,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, what is this?

1137
01:30:41,849 --> 01:30:46,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I was playing on my old console Super Nintendo one day and I scored a spectacular goal.

1138
01:30:46,091 --> 01:30:48,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is from one of the goaltenders of the Blazers.

1139
01:30:48,872 --> 01:30:53,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone just stopped and threw their sticks over their heads and I thought it was the funniest thing ever.

1140
01:30:53,874 --> 01:31:04,159
[SPEAKER_09]: So it looks like when they actually scored a goal recently... They started waving their sticks over their heads just like they did in the game.

1141
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:04,659
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cute.

1142
01:31:07,659 --> 01:31:08,119
[SPEAKER_09]: That's funny.

1143
01:31:08,179 --> 01:31:08,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that.

1144
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,521
[SPEAKER_09]: That guy doesn't even have a stick.

1145
01:31:10,601 --> 01:31:11,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at him.

1146
01:31:11,942 --> 01:31:13,663
[SPEAKER_09]: What happened to that guy?

1147
01:31:13,723 --> 01:31:14,644
[SPEAKER_09]: He lost his stick.

1148
01:31:14,684 --> 01:31:16,185
[SPEAKER_09]: He's just waving his hands in the air.

1149
01:31:19,025 --> 01:31:20,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why that's really funny, but it is.

1150
01:31:21,566 --> 01:31:30,330
[SPEAKER_09]: And SSJ100Matt continues with another tweet saying, Also, two friends got me this awesome painting by 8-bit video game painter Adam Shub.

1151
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:33,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess is the name of the person that did that.

1152
01:31:33,811 --> 01:31:35,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can't see the link that he put.

1153
01:31:35,492 --> 01:31:36,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I see this one though.

1154
01:31:36,452 --> 01:31:37,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, is that like the Earthbound?

1155
01:31:38,373 --> 01:31:41,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I get linked to a DeviantArt page called Square Painter.

1156
01:31:42,034 --> 01:31:42,514
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of cool.

1157
01:31:42,534 --> 01:31:45,796
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like a Ninja Gaiden picture and an Earthbound picture.

1158
01:31:45,816 --> 01:31:46,356
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty rad.

1159
01:31:49,486 --> 01:31:56,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Tetsuya tweets us and says, on the topic of Daft Punk, any of you guys ever seen Interstellar 555 or Interstellar 45?

1160
01:31:56,992 --> 01:32:00,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Freaking epic anime set to their Discovery album.

1161
01:32:01,155 --> 01:32:04,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen the one clip, like One More Time was a whole little anime thing.

1162
01:32:05,017 --> 01:32:05,598
[SPEAKER_09]: They all are.

1163
01:32:05,818 --> 01:32:07,679
[SPEAKER_09]: But I haven't seen the whole thing together.

1164
01:32:07,699 --> 01:32:08,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I've only seen that one song.

1165
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all by the same, I don't remember, the anime artist.

1166
01:32:11,462 --> 01:32:14,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the guy that did Galaxy Express and that kind of stuff.

1167
01:32:14,704 --> 01:32:15,945
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I've watched the whole thing.

1168
01:32:15,965 --> 01:32:17,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually had the DVD at one point.

1169
01:32:18,226 --> 01:32:19,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Might still have the DVD.

1170
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:20,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1171
01:32:20,848 --> 01:32:21,528
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I've watched it.

1172
01:32:21,549 --> 01:32:22,069
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty awesome.

1173
01:32:22,589 --> 01:32:22,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.

1174
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:25,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Got a tweet as well from Leo Shen.

1175
01:32:26,032 --> 01:32:30,514
[SPEAKER_09]: The NBC, Marvel vs. Capcom, of course, 3 final boss has been leaked.

1176
01:32:30,995 --> 01:32:37,259
[SPEAKER_09]: And we get to a YouTube here that says Galactus boss fight in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1177
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:38,540
[SPEAKER_09]: That apparently is the final boss.

1178
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:41,962
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's this whole fighting going on on a TV.

1179
01:32:42,903 --> 01:32:46,686
[SPEAKER_09]: This is probably very no-no that this is out here on the internet, but now it's out.

1180
01:32:47,847 --> 01:32:48,387
[SPEAKER_09]: So there it is.

1181
01:32:48,407 --> 01:32:49,388
[SPEAKER_09]: They're fighting Galactus.

1182
01:32:49,548 --> 01:32:50,368
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the final boss.

1183
01:32:51,429 --> 01:32:53,331
[SPEAKER_04]: He was awfully stunted for Galactus.

1184
01:32:54,431 --> 01:32:55,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's in the background.

1185
01:32:55,732 --> 01:32:56,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see.

1186
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:56,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, here he comes.

1187
01:32:56,933 --> 01:32:57,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1188
01:32:58,414 --> 01:32:58,835
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1189
01:32:58,855 --> 01:33:00,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's cool.

1190
01:33:01,597 --> 01:33:02,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you're fighting is Pinky.

1191
01:33:03,178 --> 01:33:03,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1192
01:33:04,778 --> 01:33:05,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1193
01:33:20,871 --> 01:33:21,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember now, actually.

1194
01:33:22,511 --> 01:33:23,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it was in Galactus.

1195
01:33:25,932 --> 01:33:27,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone keeps picking on Galactus.

1196
01:33:27,353 --> 01:33:29,533
[SPEAKER_04]: All he wants is a sandwich made out of, you know, a planet.

1197
01:33:32,814 --> 01:33:33,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1198
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:38,956
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw sent us some links, but sadly they are stories that are coming up later, so I gotta save those for a little later.

1199
01:33:39,516 --> 01:33:40,536
[SPEAKER_09]: That does it for Twitter tonight.

1200
01:33:40,617 --> 01:33:44,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets in the future.

1201
01:33:44,738 --> 01:33:46,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Get to those later on.

1202
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:48,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on with some more stories.

1203
01:33:48,939 --> 01:33:49,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki...

1204
01:33:49,997 --> 01:33:56,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so this is kind of cool, I guess if you're either lazy or you are disabled.

1205
01:33:58,685 --> 01:34:00,166
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I'd say it's because I'm lazy.

1206
01:34:00,846 --> 01:34:07,953
[SPEAKER_03]: But MLB 11, they are including a one-button association for disabled virtual athletes mode.

1207
01:34:08,553 --> 01:34:12,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what it will allow you to do is play the game using one button.

1208
01:34:14,377 --> 01:34:28,481
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's going to have AI handling all the fielding and the player only needs to press one button in order to swing the bat or pitch and allows gamers who might not be able to throw a baseball in real life or wield a dual shock controller ease of play.

1209
01:34:29,202 --> 01:34:30,182
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty awesome.

1210
01:34:30,962 --> 01:34:43,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, the mode was inspired by Hans Smith, a baseball superfan with cerebral palsy, whose limited mobility made it impossible for him to play a real baseball game as well as a video game as well.

1211
01:34:44,187 --> 01:34:55,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sony San Diego added him to last year's MLB game as an avatar, and then this year they went one step further with the disability-friendly gameplay mode.

1212
01:34:57,429 --> 01:34:58,110
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty sweet.

1213
01:34:58,490 --> 01:34:59,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's kind of cool.

1214
01:34:59,691 --> 01:35:01,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that they kind of did that, you know.

1215
01:35:03,553 --> 01:35:05,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you get to play online in the one-button mode?

1216
01:35:06,415 --> 01:35:06,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1217
01:35:06,755 --> 01:35:11,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see people that don't need to be using that mode using that, but hopefully that's not the case.

1218
01:35:11,859 --> 01:35:13,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you think about it, no, if you do that, just, you know.

1219
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,141
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1220
01:35:44,483 --> 01:36:13,002
[SPEAKER_09]: so there's a big big difference between that one handed mode alright well if you think maybe there should be more games like this that are easily accessible to those folks or maybe there's just a really cool idea you have for an indie game maybe this site is something you want to take a look at it's kind of a spin off of a site called Kickstarter which honestly I had never heard of until this project kind of came across my path 8bitfunding is the name of the site 8bitfunding.com

1221
01:36:13,894 --> 01:36:15,936
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what they call crowdsourcing.

1222
01:36:16,356 --> 01:36:22,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, you can donate to different projects and you might get something or a perk in return.

1223
01:36:23,481 --> 01:36:26,664
[SPEAKER_09]: So there might be these games that need help.

1224
01:36:27,024 --> 01:36:29,626
[SPEAKER_09]: They need money to fund the games or what have you.

1225
01:36:30,087 --> 01:36:38,153
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you buy into it, maybe with a certain amount, maybe they'll promise you 10% of the gross receipts.

1226
01:36:38,773 --> 01:37:05,030
[SPEAKER_09]: or maybe you'll get a cameo in the game or maybe the developer will come over to your house or something like that or develop something for you in exchange um so kind of an interesting little thing is when i was first reading this i was like okay so this is basically like a paypal donation button donate to my game now what what is the big deal about this but it's kind of some of the perks that they're offering in fact i'm kind of looking at the site right now unfortunately a lot of these games have not really raised a whole lot of money uh

1227
01:37:05,612 --> 01:37:07,213
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the same type of thing with this.

1228
01:37:07,353 --> 01:37:12,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was on the, not this 8-bit funding site, but the other one that was group sourcing.

1229
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:18,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It was for the Cthulhu, was it Cthulhu Saves the World or something like that?

1230
01:37:18,558 --> 01:37:19,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember that.

1231
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:25,841
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing the PC version and having all these different things that you could donate and get a character in the game and stuff like that.

1232
01:37:26,121 --> 01:37:27,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1233
01:37:27,121 --> 01:37:34,524
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm looking at some of these projects and all of them are looking for like $20,000, which, you know, I'm imagining must be the cost of a dev kit or to get the game online.

1234
01:37:34,625 --> 01:37:34,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1235
01:37:35,405 --> 01:37:36,345
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's see.

1236
01:37:36,405 --> 01:37:40,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I notice the game that has the most money right now is The Boo Keeper.

1237
01:37:40,927 --> 01:37:44,048
[SPEAKER_09]: $105 is how much they've raised towards their $20,000 goal.

1238
01:37:44,329 --> 01:37:45,409
[SPEAKER_09]: But the site is still new.

1239
01:37:46,009 --> 01:37:46,589
[SPEAKER_09]: So who knows?

1240
01:37:46,930 --> 01:37:49,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to look at some of the little like perks they offer here.

1241
01:37:49,531 --> 01:37:51,311
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to get this in 86 days.

1242
01:37:51,451 --> 01:37:54,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, they have like a little video as well from the developer.

1243
01:37:54,453 --> 01:37:55,033
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of neat.

1244
01:37:57,056 --> 01:38:05,593
[SPEAKER_09]: and they actually will give a game for a $5 project or two games for $20 a thank you package for $50

1245
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:10,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Give Your Voice to a Character for $1000

1246
01:38:28,173 --> 01:38:54,661
[SPEAKER_09]: uh trials and tribulations they go through 8bitfunding.com what I also noticed was here was a magazine was posted on here that they're trying to fund an actual magazine for a thousand dollars it's an indie gaming magazine kind of neat maybe we need to get some of these people on our show to hock their products who knows could be interesting I like hearing about new ideas all right so 8bitfunding.com let's move on to some more stories DarkSakura

1247
01:38:55,217 --> 01:38:56,838
[SPEAKER_04]: How about something on Kid Icarus?

1248
01:38:57,298 --> 01:38:57,698
[SPEAKER_09]: How about it?

1249
01:38:58,278 --> 01:39:00,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not going to be out until after E3.

1250
01:39:01,599 --> 01:39:03,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Zelda, for that matter.

1251
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:18,844
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually saying that, of course, we've mentioned earlier that neither of those are going to be launch titles for the 3DS, that they are going to be out early June, which is right after E3, so it's speculated.

1252
01:39:19,364 --> 01:39:19,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, though.

1253
01:39:19,885 --> 01:39:21,966
[SPEAKER_04]: When you said the news, I couldn't help but feel like this.

1254
01:39:37,176 --> 01:39:39,937
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's kind of the news I think we were all expecting, honestly.

1255
01:39:39,997 --> 01:39:41,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if the game wasn't coming out at launch.

1256
01:39:41,758 --> 01:39:44,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I was convinced Kid Icarus was going to make it out at launch, though.

1257
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:46,360
[SPEAKER_09]: They made such a big deal out of that at E3.

1258
01:39:46,821 --> 01:39:48,021
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of, last year anyway.

1259
01:39:48,281 --> 01:39:50,002
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of shocking that it is delayed.

1260
01:39:50,062 --> 01:39:50,662
[SPEAKER_09]: But again.

1261
01:39:51,022 --> 01:39:52,663
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just teasing, Rob, teasing.

1262
01:39:52,743 --> 01:39:54,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've got to make sure the game is great.

1263
01:39:54,724 --> 01:39:55,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't release a mediocre game.

1264
01:39:56,005 --> 01:39:56,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gaming foreplay.

1265
01:39:59,026 --> 01:40:25,989
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm all for them taking more time to do it if they need the time to make the game great so it's just a bummer they didn't have anything done ready to go with the exception of I guess Nintendogs and what is it the submarine game or whatever that's true Pilotwings might be interesting I don't know though I didn't feel Pilotwings 64 the same way I did the original SNES version which is still one of my favorites I love Pilotwings on the SNES so there you go

1266
01:40:28,504 --> 01:40:30,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, Loki, what do you have for us?

1267
01:40:30,186 --> 01:40:31,788
[SPEAKER_09]: The mailbag's coming up soon, by the way, you guys.

1268
01:40:31,808 --> 01:40:34,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and soon your calls.

1269
01:40:34,991 --> 01:40:36,192
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to use the week and so much more.

1270
01:40:36,332 --> 01:40:36,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1271
01:40:37,093 --> 01:40:40,717
[SPEAKER_03]: More disappointing congressmen coming from California.

1272
01:40:40,837 --> 01:40:43,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, it's just... What do we have?

1273
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Idiots working in Congress over here?

1274
01:40:45,642 --> 01:40:46,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't vote for them.

1275
01:40:46,763 --> 01:40:46,884
[SPEAKER_03]: It's...

1276
01:40:47,611 --> 01:40:51,834
[SPEAKER_03]: This time it's not Lee though, so it is a different Congressman.

1277
01:40:52,095 --> 01:41:03,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Baca, he introduced against legislation back in 2009 that required games to display labels of warnings between link of violent video games and aggressive behavior.

1278
01:41:04,364 --> 01:41:08,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Now apparently he's come back and now he's trying to pitch a similar thing.

1279
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:13,994
[SPEAKER_03]: He's saying that he wants a warning to be put on these games.

1280
01:41:14,014 --> 01:41:20,320
[SPEAKER_03]: So warning, excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior.

1281
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:29,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says, I guess the 2009 act failed to gain momentum, but he's now relabeled it the Video Game Health Labeling Act of 2011.

1282
01:41:29,562 --> 01:41:36,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically the same act with the same goal, putting warning labels on games rated teen and above.

1283
01:41:37,064 --> 01:41:46,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently now, I guess the only difference this time around is that he's gained support of Virginia Congressman Frank Wolf.

1284
01:41:57,788 --> 01:42:10,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as we warn smokers of health consequences of tobacco, we should warn parents and children about the growing scientific evidence demonstrating a relationship between violent video games and violent behavior.

1285
01:42:10,795 --> 01:42:21,038
[SPEAKER_03]: As a parent and grandparent, I think it's important to have people know everything they can about the extremely violent nature of some of these games.

1286
01:42:22,338 --> 01:42:25,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is great, because that's what's on the ESRB label.

1287
01:42:25,919 --> 01:42:28,080
[SPEAKER_03]: It shows you what kind of content's in those games.

1288
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:30,760
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't need to do this.

1289
01:42:31,561 --> 01:42:32,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand what the point is.

1290
01:42:34,681 --> 01:42:36,222
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently they are...

1291
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:39,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1292
01:42:49,645 --> 01:42:50,445
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I feel.

1293
01:42:51,306 --> 01:42:51,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good to me.

1294
01:42:52,986 --> 01:42:58,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, I mean, if you're going to put warning labels on video games, you're going to put warnings on movies.

1295
01:42:58,989 --> 01:43:01,210
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to put warnings on sugary candy.

1296
01:43:01,891 --> 01:43:04,332
[SPEAKER_09]: May cause your kid to have a short attention span.

1297
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:09,634
[SPEAKER_03]: If you, I mean, I'm sorry, but first off, violent video games don't affect everybody the same way.

1298
01:43:09,775 --> 01:43:13,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And there hasn't been, there's been studies that go both ways with that.

1299
01:43:13,196 --> 01:43:14,657
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing definitive about it.

1300
01:43:15,305 --> 01:43:21,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And we already have a label on the box that shows what kind of content's in the game.

1301
01:43:22,028 --> 01:43:22,968
[SPEAKER_03]: It shows if it's violent.

1302
01:43:22,988 --> 01:43:23,528
[SPEAKER_03]: It shows if there's nudity.

1303
01:43:23,548 --> 01:43:26,769
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you read the back of the box, you can get a pretty good idea, too.

1304
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:29,190
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need another label saying that there's nudity.

1305
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:40,995
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to buy a game called Zombie Massacre 2011, the back of the box is probably going to indicate to you that it's probably pretty violent and that you will be massacring zombies in the game.

1306
01:43:41,235 --> 01:43:42,235
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not suddenly going to get...

1307
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:47,879
[SPEAKER_09]: A game with puppets and rainbows and whatever.

1308
01:43:48,379 --> 01:43:48,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Stupid.

1309
01:43:49,079 --> 01:43:50,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppet Rainbow Massacre.

1310
01:43:52,021 --> 01:43:52,962
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a little bit different.

1311
01:43:52,982 --> 01:43:54,603
[SPEAKER_04]: They did that in an episode of Angel.

1312
01:43:54,743 --> 01:43:57,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sorry, but isn't there like a budget to be balanced?

1313
01:43:58,046 --> 01:43:59,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Aren't there jobs that need to be created?

1314
01:43:59,707 --> 01:44:01,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this stuff does cost money.

1315
01:44:01,628 --> 01:44:05,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And why are these congressmen wasting time on this stuff?

1316
01:44:05,911 --> 01:44:06,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1317
01:44:06,491 --> 01:44:08,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially California congressmen.

1318
01:44:08,773 --> 01:44:09,673
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a word for it.

1319
01:44:11,134 --> 01:44:11,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Two words, actually.

1320
01:44:12,495 --> 01:44:13,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Budget allocation.

1321
01:44:15,407 --> 01:44:17,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Funding.

1322
01:44:17,529 --> 01:44:25,176
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to get donations for their 2012 campaign by pleasing some moral superiority board?

1323
01:44:25,776 --> 01:44:31,581
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the stuff like that that actually pulls in other funds for the different areas of...

1324
01:44:33,294 --> 01:44:35,535
[SPEAKER_04]: The different committees and different stuff that they're trying to allocate money to.

1325
01:44:35,555 --> 01:44:38,955
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we have the big problems, because they need to go through and do a whole big audit.

1326
01:44:39,295 --> 01:44:42,696
[SPEAKER_04]: And they need to have the audit done by someone not in government, but by an outside party.

1327
01:44:43,336 --> 01:44:47,377
[SPEAKER_09]: So in other words, if this type of movement didn't exist, the committee might get folded?

1328
01:44:48,958 --> 01:44:49,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

1329
01:44:49,478 --> 01:44:50,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Then fold the fucking committee!

1330
01:44:51,158 --> 01:44:53,119
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a waste of our goddamn time!

1331
01:44:53,399 --> 01:44:54,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's goddamn time!

1332
01:44:55,239 --> 01:44:55,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Agreed.

1333
01:44:57,260 --> 01:45:01,681
[SPEAKER_09]: One more time, Congressman Joe Baca, I'm expressing my First Amendment right in telling you...

1334
01:45:02,759 --> 01:45:03,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1335
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:04,361
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

1336
01:45:04,561 --> 01:45:05,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Moron.

1337
01:45:05,942 --> 01:45:07,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut the fuck up.

1338
01:45:07,964 --> 01:45:08,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Pendulet.

1339
01:45:10,647 --> 01:45:13,490
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was funny because... Never mind.

1340
01:45:14,971 --> 01:45:15,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1341
01:45:17,374 --> 01:45:20,877
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's the best thing that committee can come up with, then it deserves to be folded.

1342
01:45:23,159 --> 01:45:23,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

1343
01:45:25,542 --> 01:45:25,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugh.

1344
01:45:26,047 --> 01:45:27,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I can hear it in my head now.

1345
01:45:27,268 --> 01:45:27,749
[SPEAKER_09]: You mad?

1346
01:45:28,289 --> 01:45:29,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I am mad.

1347
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:30,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let me move on.

1348
01:45:30,331 --> 01:45:30,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1349
01:45:31,292 --> 01:45:33,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Sarian.net Remember that website?

1350
01:45:33,434 --> 01:45:40,640
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the website where you could play action Sierra games, adventure games like King's Quest and all this stuff.

1351
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:41,721
[SPEAKER_09]: You could play it on your iPad.

1352
01:45:42,021 --> 01:45:46,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were all sitting here going, just a matter of time before this thing gets shut down.

1353
01:45:46,585 --> 01:45:48,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, we are waiting for this thing to get shut down.

1354
01:45:49,088 --> 01:45:49,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess what happened, guys?

1355
01:45:50,709 --> 01:45:51,610
[SPEAKER_09]: It got shut down this week.

1356
01:45:51,650 --> 01:45:52,050
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1357
01:45:52,871 --> 01:45:58,534
[SPEAKER_09]: And a letter from Activision's legal counsel got posted on the website for everybody to read.

1358
01:45:58,634 --> 01:46:00,796
[SPEAKER_09]: And I liked how some of this email went.

1359
01:46:01,476 --> 01:46:12,624
[SPEAKER_09]: While we appreciate your dedication to the Sierra Classic Library and understand that you are a fan of these games, Activision has not authorized the development or distribution of these games via your website.

1360
01:46:13,024 --> 01:46:20,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Accordingly, we must demand that you immediately cease any further distribution or exploitation, I like that word, of the Sierra games on your website.

1361
01:46:21,089 --> 01:46:26,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, as much as you want to paint Activision as the big bad evil people, I don't know.

1362
01:46:26,994 --> 01:46:28,515
[SPEAKER_09]: They kind of do have a point.

1363
01:46:28,675 --> 01:46:32,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it is their games and this whole thing, posting them public, you know.

1364
01:46:33,298 --> 01:46:36,501
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're not going to do anything with it, then what the hell are you doing?

1365
01:46:37,554 --> 01:46:37,854
[SPEAKER_09]: and so on.

1366
01:46:55,767 --> 01:47:02,855
[SPEAKER_09]: There is another interesting development that happened this week that's worth mentioning, and that is that it wasn't totally shut down after the cease and desist.

1367
01:47:03,616 --> 01:47:10,002
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like Activision ended up giving Sarian approval to continue running in a limited capacity.

1368
01:47:10,723 --> 01:47:17,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Sarian.net is now able to publish the first game of any series in its multiplayer HTML5 form.

1369
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:21,894
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess this whole new little way of doing it is available.

1370
01:47:22,334 --> 01:47:26,737
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the iPad versions are no longer there because they might want to develop it sometimes.

1371
01:47:27,278 --> 01:47:32,642
[SPEAKER_09]: And Activision has allowed at least that, which I think is somewhat generous.

1372
01:47:33,162 --> 01:47:35,204
[SPEAKER_09]: There are also links to buy the games on Steam.

1373
01:47:35,824 --> 01:47:37,706
[SPEAKER_04]: That's free advertising for retro titles.

1374
01:47:38,586 --> 01:47:38,827
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

1375
01:47:39,347 --> 01:47:42,669
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like as much as you want to hate Activision...

1376
01:47:44,030 --> 01:48:12,647
[SPEAKER_09]: you can't say they're not doing anything with this you are able to buy the games legitimately out there somewhere so I don't know it's a little bit hard for me to get mad at Activision for cease and desisting somebody trying to give that away for free it does pain me that Activision continues to do nothing new in this genre but I guess at least we always have the silver lining which by the way episode 3 was delayed but it will be coming out when it's ready

1377
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:14,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what you did there.

1378
01:48:14,402 --> 01:48:14,822
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1379
01:48:15,682 --> 01:48:16,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the mailbag.

1380
01:48:20,423 --> 01:48:24,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com is where you can send us your emails every week.

1381
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:27,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got to say, guys, the email bag is still in a pretty sad state.

1382
01:48:27,745 --> 01:48:31,286
[SPEAKER_09]: We got one email this week and it's not signed.

1383
01:48:31,426 --> 01:48:37,407
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll just say it's from Adam H. Wanting us to talk about the PSP2 or the NGP.

1384
01:48:38,767 --> 01:48:41,088
[SPEAKER_09]: and linking us to the blog where we could talk about that.

1385
01:48:41,588 --> 01:48:44,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think we did go over pretty much the big stuff.

1386
01:48:44,030 --> 01:48:44,350
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1387
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:50,212
[SPEAKER_09]: We did go over the big stuff in part A. I will give the courtesy of looking at this website here and see if there's anything we didn't cover because you never know.

1388
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:52,774
[SPEAKER_09]: There might be little stuff that falls through the crack or whatever.

1389
01:48:53,754 --> 01:48:54,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1390
01:48:55,555 --> 01:48:55,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

1391
01:48:55,795 --> 01:48:56,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Screenshots.

1392
01:48:56,415 --> 01:48:57,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Got those.

1393
01:48:57,656 --> 01:48:58,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Uncharted Portable.

1394
01:48:58,776 --> 01:49:00,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1395
01:49:00,517 --> 01:49:03,379
[SPEAKER_09]: 5-inch organic light-emitting display.

1396
01:49:03,579 --> 01:49:04,439
[SPEAKER_09]: We already mentioned that.

1397
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:06,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Or did you use the word organic?

1398
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:06,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1399
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:07,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I did OLED.

1400
01:49:07,921 --> 01:49:08,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1401
01:49:09,022 --> 01:49:10,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Sixaxis is in it.

1402
01:49:10,403 --> 01:49:11,063
[SPEAKER_09]: GPS.

1403
01:49:12,104 --> 01:49:13,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think we covered all this, dude.

1404
01:49:13,565 --> 01:49:13,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1405
01:49:14,426 --> 01:49:15,026
[SPEAKER_09]: But, hey.

1406
01:49:15,487 --> 01:49:16,628
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some nice little pictures.

1407
01:49:16,688 --> 01:49:18,109
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the whole back touchpad.

1408
01:49:18,149 --> 01:49:20,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks kind of funny with all the little PlayStation symbols over and over.

1409
01:49:22,132 --> 01:49:24,794
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, our mailbag is in kind of a sad state tonight, I'm sorry to say.

1410
01:49:26,155 --> 01:49:28,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com if you want to help us out for future weeks.

1411
01:49:28,676 --> 01:49:30,978
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll fold your laundry, wash the cat.

1412
01:49:31,258 --> 01:49:31,619
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1413
01:49:32,139 --> 01:49:34,581
[SPEAKER_09]: So, meanwhile, let's get into some FUs, some angst.

1414
01:49:49,693 --> 01:49:51,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I have three FUs, and I love you.

1415
01:49:53,095 --> 01:49:55,377
[SPEAKER_04]: My FUs... Aw, I love you too!

1416
01:49:55,817 --> 01:50:00,460
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU goes to being sick, because I hate it.

1417
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:07,945
[SPEAKER_04]: My second FU goes to the CW for playing Supernatural by week, because damn it, I've been waiting for this damn episode.

1418
01:50:09,190 --> 01:50:11,491
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, stop teasing me.

1419
01:50:12,191 --> 01:50:23,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And then F you to all of the people in the torrent community who decided to capitalize on the fact that certain people don't actually watch active TV and download the episodes as a torrent and decide to put out a virus torrent.

1420
01:50:25,245 --> 01:50:34,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Which thankfully, the moment you see the Windows error, you know, codec thing, you have to stop it before it goes to whatever site to update the codec.

1421
01:50:34,331 --> 01:50:36,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't, you know, accidentally virus you.

1422
01:50:37,393 --> 01:50:38,454
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, stupid.

1423
01:50:38,574 --> 01:50:41,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And my love goes to Dan, because he's been taking good care of me.

1424
01:50:42,977 --> 01:50:43,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Aww.

1425
01:50:43,217 --> 01:50:43,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey.

1426
01:50:43,577 --> 01:50:47,860
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a little sick there, Rob.

1427
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I think I caught whatever you guys have.

1428
01:50:49,942 --> 01:50:50,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's got our plague.

1429
01:50:50,762 --> 01:50:51,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1430
01:50:52,263 --> 01:50:53,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you have an FU of the week.

1431
01:50:55,203 --> 01:51:03,572
[SPEAKER_03]: mainly just to Xbox 360s being so delicate and fragile that they'll break within five minutes.

1432
01:51:03,832 --> 01:51:05,093
[SPEAKER_09]: What, did you drop one?

1433
01:51:05,393 --> 01:51:06,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't drop one.

1434
01:51:06,434 --> 01:51:07,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have to drop one.

1435
01:51:07,696 --> 01:51:08,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I turned it on.

1436
01:51:09,097 --> 01:51:14,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I switched the monitor resolution and it went and died.

1437
01:51:15,844 --> 01:51:20,971
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, the original consoles, man, I swear, if you have a Xenon console, it's gonna die.

1438
01:51:21,231 --> 01:51:24,075
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

1439
01:51:29,124 --> 01:51:30,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a lot of FUs.

1440
01:51:30,404 --> 01:51:32,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Things are relatively well right now.

1441
01:51:32,445 --> 01:51:35,405
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll just say FU to money or lack thereof.

1442
01:51:35,425 --> 01:51:36,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Never having enough of it.

1443
01:51:37,806 --> 01:51:40,386
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to Disneyland being crowded yesterday.

1444
01:51:40,486 --> 01:51:41,927
[SPEAKER_09]: That's never fun to go on a crowded day.

1445
01:51:42,327 --> 01:51:43,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody else needs to go somewhere else when I'm there.

1446
01:51:44,627 --> 01:51:47,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess FU to the fact that I didn't get to spend enough time there.

1447
01:51:47,848 --> 01:51:49,308
[SPEAKER_09]: It really was just like a fast, fast trip.

1448
01:51:49,428 --> 01:51:51,669
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that's really it.

1449
01:51:53,263 --> 01:51:54,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, things are pretty good.

1450
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:57,767
[SPEAKER_09]: If those are my FUs, then things are pretty well in my world.

1451
01:51:58,487 --> 01:51:59,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

1452
01:51:59,428 --> 01:52:00,529
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple more stories for you guys.

1453
01:52:00,549 --> 01:52:05,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1454
01:52:06,133 --> 01:52:10,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Please make sure before you call us, echo 123 if you are on Skype.

1455
01:52:10,557 --> 01:52:12,418
[SPEAKER_09]: You must, must, must test yourself first.

1456
01:52:12,798 --> 01:52:16,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I think even Skype puts in there now, click this button to make a test call.

1457
01:52:16,882 --> 01:52:18,523
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to do that before you go on the radio.

1458
01:52:18,823 --> 01:52:20,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, listen to the nice lady that says, you know,

1459
01:52:21,405 --> 01:52:24,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, welcome to the Skype call testing service.

1460
01:52:24,948 --> 01:52:27,270
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to hear her before you hear us, so please do that now.

1461
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:29,351
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're using the phone, that's easy.

1462
01:52:29,592 --> 01:52:30,492
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just pick it up and call.

1463
01:52:30,833 --> 01:52:32,534
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, but we're not taking the calls just yet.

1464
01:52:32,594 --> 01:52:34,135
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a couple more stories for you first.

1465
01:52:34,215 --> 01:52:34,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1466
01:52:35,756 --> 01:52:42,382
[SPEAKER_03]: One other thing that was announced during the PlayStation conference, and it wasn't necessarily the PlayStation phone...

1467
01:52:42,922 --> 01:52:44,443
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the PlayStation Suite.

1468
01:52:44,643 --> 01:52:49,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the PlayStation Suite is, is actually a couple things.

1469
01:52:49,106 --> 01:52:55,270
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, it's going to be a PlayStation store that's going to be available for Android phones.

1470
01:52:56,710 --> 01:53:02,214
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll allow you to purchase different PlayStation games.

1471
01:53:02,654 --> 01:53:03,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1472
01:53:29,181 --> 01:53:34,789
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course some of the games that they're mentioning that are going to be available are actually early PlayStation 1 games.

1473
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:40,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold Borders 2, Syphon Filter and Rallycross, Wild Arms and Medieval.

1474
01:53:41,437 --> 01:53:41,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my bad.

1475
01:54:12,116 --> 01:54:13,237
[SPEAKER_03]: or the Android iOS.

1476
01:54:13,457 --> 01:54:17,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we can't really say it's just for phones now since they do have tablets now with the Android iOS.

1477
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:21,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I remember something about this is all going to tie into the NGP as well too, right?

1478
01:54:21,802 --> 01:54:30,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's a way to get PlayStation content out there on more than just the PlayStation phone.

1479
01:54:31,937 --> 01:54:33,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, neat.

1480
01:54:33,918 --> 01:54:43,745
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly though, I mean, just looking at, unless you have that PlayStation phone, I can imagine this is going to suck just because, I mean, just look at the controls.

1481
01:54:43,826 --> 01:54:46,127
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes up like so much screen space.

1482
01:54:46,227 --> 01:54:46,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just ridiculous.

1483
01:54:46,968 --> 01:54:48,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, touch controls are ridiculous too.

1484
01:54:48,689 --> 01:54:49,970
[SPEAKER_09]: You need tangible buttons.

1485
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:51,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget it otherwise, honestly.

1486
01:54:52,212 --> 01:54:52,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1487
01:54:53,032 --> 01:54:55,354
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one thing we've learned from iPhone gaming.

1488
01:54:55,454 --> 01:54:57,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Very few iPhone games really, really work.

1489
01:54:58,275 --> 01:55:00,237
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to be designed for that touch.

1490
01:55:00,597 --> 01:55:04,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Things like Cut the Rope work because it's very easy.

1491
01:55:04,459 --> 01:55:08,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Things like, I guess, Angry Birds, although I've never played it, work because it's based around the touch controls.

1492
01:55:09,423 --> 01:55:14,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Things like a port of Mega Man fail because you need tangible controls in order to be able to play it.

1493
01:55:15,703 --> 01:55:18,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that Escaluda worked very well with touch controls.

1494
01:55:19,084 --> 01:55:19,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1495
01:55:19,704 --> 01:55:21,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that's because it has auto-fire and stuff.

1496
01:55:22,705 --> 01:55:23,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it without auto-fire.

1497
01:55:23,865 --> 01:55:24,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1498
01:55:24,105 --> 01:55:24,986
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually plays really well.

1499
01:55:25,266 --> 01:55:27,306
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mushihime-sama was really fun.

1500
01:55:28,547 --> 01:55:28,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1501
01:55:29,027 --> 01:55:30,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I need tangible buttons.

1502
01:55:31,387 --> 01:55:33,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was all Sony's thing with the move.

1503
01:55:33,688 --> 01:55:34,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you like buttons?

1504
01:55:36,389 --> 01:55:36,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1505
01:55:38,061 --> 01:55:47,487
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, one more story for you guys before the Skype line tonight, and it has to do with World of Warcraft, but it's kind of an interesting one because you know where WoW goes, other MMOs tend to follow.

1506
01:55:47,887 --> 01:55:48,968
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of interesting.

1507
01:55:49,428 --> 01:55:52,751
[SPEAKER_09]: WoW has gone after gold sellers in a whole new way.

1508
01:55:53,351 --> 01:55:54,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Paypal Paypal Paypal Paypal

1509
01:56:08,488 --> 01:56:36,244
[SPEAKER_09]: very interesting because you know these places are in other countries and so forth and they accept PayPal as a method of payment which you know a lot of folks don't want to give companies well folks shouldn't be using these fucking things in the first place but on the other hand you know when they do use them they don't want to use their real credit card info so they'll often use PayPal well now they've kind of cut off that bridge so I think that's kind of cool that they did that that was a smart way to go about doing it so yeah that's how they're going after it cut out the middleman

1510
01:56:38,407 --> 01:56:56,293
[SPEAKER_09]: and they could kind of strong arm PayPal too because I'm pretty sure they take PayPal as a method of payment for the game itself so they could tell PayPal either do this or we're going to stop taking your thing as a form of payment you know they could kind of strong arm them like that I'm not saying that's what they did but I could imagine that being part of the conversation

1511
01:56:57,054 --> 01:56:58,836
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1512
01:57:10,979 --> 01:57:18,266
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I mean, I think it's convenient to have it there if you want to get a little thing here or there.

1513
01:57:18,487 --> 01:57:26,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly, you pay $10 and get 1,200 points, which I bought tons of stuff with my points.

1514
01:57:26,855 --> 01:57:33,822
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that they need to be a little bit more judicious with what they will and won't accept via PayPal.

1515
01:57:33,842 --> 01:57:33,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1516
01:57:34,833 --> 01:57:35,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I heart the guild.

1517
01:58:00,512 --> 01:58:01,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, because they've helped you out.

1518
01:58:01,913 --> 01:58:02,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

1519
01:58:02,334 --> 01:58:02,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Find a guild.

1520
01:58:03,035 --> 01:58:04,576
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need to buy gold.

1521
01:58:04,696 --> 01:58:05,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Find a guild of nice people.

1522
01:58:05,918 --> 01:58:06,999
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't steal from your guild.

1523
01:58:07,539 --> 01:58:08,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, don't steal from your guild.

1524
01:58:09,862 --> 01:58:15,067
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're in the game to just profit profit and steal everything from your guild, then you're in the game for the wrong reasons.

1525
01:58:15,788 --> 01:58:18,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Play the auction house game if money making is what you want.

1526
01:58:19,371 --> 01:58:21,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy out a certain item and then sell it for triple.

1527
01:58:21,353 --> 01:58:21,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1528
01:58:22,688 --> 01:58:24,830
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's open up the Skype line right now.

1529
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:28,513
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1530
01:58:28,553 --> 01:58:29,373
[SPEAKER_09]: The phones are open.

1531
01:58:29,734 --> 01:58:31,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Take your calls on any topic we've talked about tonight.

1532
01:58:31,916 --> 01:58:33,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you have a comment on the NGP itself.

1533
01:58:33,817 --> 01:58:34,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you want to talk 3DS.

1534
01:58:35,559 --> 01:58:39,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you want to talk about that whole PS3 hacking mess or something we haven't brought up yet.

1535
01:58:40,122 --> 01:58:41,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you want to talk about, the phones are open.

1536
01:58:41,784 --> 01:58:47,048
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1537
01:58:47,508 --> 01:58:50,631
[SPEAKER_09]: While we wait for those calls to come in, Loki, do you have any quick last minute stories for us?

1538
01:58:53,169 --> 01:58:54,070
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really.

1539
01:58:54,270 --> 01:58:55,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not yet.

1540
01:58:56,090 --> 01:59:02,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that Galactus video, that was someone that was playing on a pirated Xbox 360 version.

1541
01:59:02,853 --> 01:59:04,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Naughty, naughty.

1542
01:59:04,773 --> 01:59:05,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Naughty, naughty.

1543
01:59:06,514 --> 01:59:08,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can see the 360 in the background there.

1544
01:59:08,975 --> 01:59:09,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

1545
01:59:11,745 --> 01:59:14,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, some other fun stuff we could talk about here.

1546
01:59:17,128 --> 01:59:18,648
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of neat, we haven't mentioned this yet.

1547
01:59:19,008 --> 01:59:26,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Platinum's new game that's coming out, Max Anarchy, well at least that's how it's known in other places, is coming over as Anarchy Reigns.

1548
01:59:26,792 --> 01:59:34,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of an MMO brawler game, and it also features the main character from Mad World, but in full color this time.

1549
01:59:34,235 --> 01:59:37,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's actually kind of in all the trailers and stuff.

1550
01:59:37,296 --> 01:59:38,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly though, I kind of...

1551
01:59:39,497 --> 01:59:40,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like him better black and white.

1552
01:59:41,778 --> 01:59:44,339
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't look that cool when he's non-black and white.

1553
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:45,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1554
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:46,519
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just my opinion.

1555
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:49,060
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

1556
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:50,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1557
01:59:50,181 --> 01:59:50,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1558
01:59:51,581 --> 01:59:53,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

1559
01:59:53,182 --> 01:59:53,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Spazinator.

1560
01:59:53,842 --> 01:59:54,482
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1561
01:59:55,983 --> 02:00:03,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, since it's pretty much the topic of the night, I just want to chime in on the NGP or whatever it's called.

1562
02:00:03,585 --> 02:00:04,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever they end up calling it.

1563
02:00:04,606 --> 02:00:04,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1564
02:00:04,846 --> 02:00:05,386
[SPEAKER_09]: What are your thoughts?

1565
02:00:06,741 --> 02:00:18,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, even though some people within the Dialgames community would like to pick me as a Sony fanboy, I'm a little hesitant to even consider getting the NGP.

1566
02:00:21,211 --> 02:00:33,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Although the system does sound nice on paper, but the truth is, even with my PSP, I very rarely touch it.

1567
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:34,920
[SPEAKER_06]: And

1568
02:00:36,356 --> 02:00:41,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, nowadays, I only use it for downloading podcasts and whatnot, and that's about it.

1569
02:00:41,657 --> 02:00:42,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me back up.

1570
02:00:42,497 --> 02:00:44,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Why did you abandon your PSP?

1571
02:00:44,798 --> 02:00:53,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it a lack of the games that you have to play, or what caused you, you think, to abandon... Or, I don't know, are you a DS player now, or what caused you to abandon the PSP?

1572
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:57,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was a DS player for a while, too.

1573
02:00:58,181 --> 02:01:03,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I had both systems, but truth be told, you know, there's more games on...

1574
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:08,762
[SPEAKER_06]: The PS3 and the 360 that I would much rather play.

1575
02:01:11,924 --> 02:01:16,187
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, on the 360, I constantly play Game Room.

1576
02:01:16,687 --> 02:01:21,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And on PS3, I play a lot of Super Stardust, HD, so on and so forth.

1577
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:29,294
[SPEAKER_06]: And between the two main consoles, there's more games on there that I'm interested in as opposed to handhelds.

1578
02:01:29,734 --> 02:01:34,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And considering that I'm on the budget, I have to watch...

1579
02:01:35,569 --> 02:01:40,473
[SPEAKER_06]: How much I spend on games and don't really have enough money to go all the way around.

1580
02:01:40,593 --> 02:01:51,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather play my games on consoles as opposed to handhelds because really, isn't the point of handhelds to go out and buy a Play-Doh when you're not at home?

1581
02:01:51,481 --> 02:01:54,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm usually home pretty much 24-7.

1582
02:01:59,677 --> 02:02:13,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at first, yeah, I did play my PSP a lot initially, playing out like the Darkstalkers games and the ports of PS2 games, but I just generally found myself playing the system less and less.

1583
02:02:14,375 --> 02:02:16,696
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of the price that freaks you out, too, though.

1584
02:02:16,776 --> 02:02:23,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because you mentioned that you have a very limited budget, kind of like I mentioned earlier.

1585
02:02:23,617 --> 02:02:30,479
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just certain people, especially in this economy, this day and age, that don't have a lot of the extra money, and they kind of know this is going to be expensive.

1586
02:02:30,559 --> 02:02:34,220
[SPEAKER_09]: So is it kind of like the price that scares you, too?

1587
02:02:34,740 --> 02:02:36,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, basically, in a nutshell, yeah.

1588
02:02:36,761 --> 02:02:37,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I live under $800 a month.

1589
02:02:38,001 --> 02:02:38,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1590
02:02:38,201 --> 02:02:39,281
[SPEAKER_06]: And that basically...

1591
02:02:42,489 --> 02:02:55,499
[SPEAKER_06]: That basically, that $800 a month not even has to go towards rent, food, my time order bill, so on and so forth.

1592
02:02:55,519 --> 02:02:57,401
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a lot of room for entertainment there.

1593
02:02:58,341 --> 02:02:59,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1594
02:02:59,782 --> 02:03:09,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, I can manage to keep my expenses low because the cost of living in Buffalo, New York is pretty low, but still, even with that, that leaves me with...

1595
02:03:11,576 --> 02:03:16,863
[SPEAKER_06]: roughly $200 a month that if I'm lucky I'm able to save and whatnot.

1596
02:03:17,463 --> 02:03:17,804
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact,

1597
02:03:18,685 --> 02:03:23,189
[SPEAKER_06]: It took me like a year just to save up for this netbook that I just recently got.

1598
02:03:24,630 --> 02:03:29,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me ask you this, though, because obviously the system is expensive.

1599
02:03:30,554 --> 02:03:36,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think you would use or try to save up anyway for one of the competitors to a PSP2?

1600
02:03:36,759 --> 02:03:45,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there something that maybe interests you more about the 3DS or maybe even the iPad, you could say, as a competitor of the NGP, whatever it's called?

1601
02:03:45,986 --> 02:03:52,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there either of those that maybe interest you more that you would save up for or no, I'm not interested in this wave of technology at all?

1602
02:03:53,172 --> 02:03:59,738
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of hard to say just now because obviously all those systems aren't quite out yet.

1603
02:04:00,919 --> 02:04:12,028
[SPEAKER_06]: If I do consider going out and buying any handheld whatsoever, whether it be 3DS or PSP2 or what have you, I would have to wait like...

1604
02:04:13,669 --> 02:04:18,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to pull a figure out, but let's say a year, year and a half.

1605
02:04:18,933 --> 02:04:24,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait to see what comes up for whatever system and see if those games would interest me.

1606
02:04:25,097 --> 02:04:27,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Then maybe, yeah, I'll consider getting them.

1607
02:04:27,598 --> 02:04:35,864
[SPEAKER_06]: But if nothing of interest comes up for me, like at least bare minimum, I don't know, 15 games at least.

1608
02:04:37,111 --> 02:04:39,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Just say forget it.

1609
02:04:40,194 --> 02:04:44,319
[SPEAKER_09]: So in other words, it's the games that are on the system that are going to make it or break it for you.

1610
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:52,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and they would have to be like exclusive games, not found on the home systems.

1611
02:04:53,809 --> 02:04:55,311
[SPEAKER_06]: No ports of any kind.

1612
02:04:55,951 --> 02:04:57,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, truly exclusive stuff or...

1613
02:05:00,430 --> 02:05:26,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear you buddy it's you know our golden rule of gaming a system is only as good as the games that are on it so I think it's a smart approach for you know a budget gamer to wait and see you know let the people that have more disposable income kind of beta test everything for you I suppose so Spazinator I gotta let you go to get more calls but thank you as always and who knows maybe you'll win a contest at a local store maybe win one of these guys for free I'll be hoping for you alright have a good one buddy

1614
02:05:27,662 --> 02:05:32,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR is our number or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

1615
02:05:33,949 --> 02:05:36,812
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt agrees in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

1616
02:05:36,832 --> 02:05:37,953
[SPEAKER_09]: The price will be key.

1617
02:05:38,554 --> 02:05:41,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Bonds006 says, I am PC till death.

1618
02:05:42,598 --> 02:05:47,964
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an interesting way of looking at it, especially from the whole budget perspective is that, well, I have this PC anyway.

1619
02:05:49,039 --> 02:05:51,121
[SPEAKER_09]: There's tons and tons of games available on PC.

1620
02:05:51,201 --> 02:05:54,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Why even bother with a handheld or even a console?

1621
02:05:55,684 --> 02:05:57,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got everything I need right in my PC.

1622
02:05:57,646 --> 02:05:59,548
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the way a lot of people look at it, surprisingly enough.

1623
02:05:59,568 --> 02:06:03,010
[SPEAKER_09]: 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

1624
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:04,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any other last-minute stories, Loki, to hold us over?

1625
02:06:04,972 --> 02:06:06,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we get more ringing rings?

1626
02:06:09,356 --> 02:06:11,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just see here what I've got here.

1627
02:06:12,858 --> 02:06:14,180
[SPEAKER_09]: What can you pull out of your butt, Loki?

1628
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:15,421
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I pull out of my butt?

1629
02:06:19,922 --> 02:06:24,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to know what Loki can pull out of his butt.

1630
02:06:24,170 --> 02:06:26,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I meant like story-wise.

1631
02:06:27,316 --> 02:06:29,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Not actual.

1632
02:06:29,721 --> 02:06:29,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1633
02:06:31,786 --> 02:06:33,087
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't a whole lot, actually.

1634
02:06:33,227 --> 02:06:38,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny, this week I was surprised that there wasn't a whole lot of news other than the PSP stuff.

1635
02:06:38,131 --> 02:06:40,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, other than that big press conference, that's really it, I guess.

1636
02:06:41,133 --> 02:06:45,336
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just kind of like, wow, isn't that NGP awesome?

1637
02:06:45,876 --> 02:06:48,158
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so awesome.

1638
02:06:48,798 --> 02:06:50,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder how much it's going to be.

1639
02:06:50,279 --> 02:06:52,321
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 3DS was like,

1640
02:06:53,334 --> 02:06:54,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone remember about me?

1641
02:06:55,415 --> 02:06:59,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I think by the time the 3DS comes out, that will change quite a bit.

1642
02:07:01,958 --> 02:07:02,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we got another call.

1643
02:07:02,878 --> 02:07:03,319
[SPEAKER_09]: You're saved.

1644
02:07:03,419 --> 02:07:04,619
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find something else for after this.

1645
02:07:04,659 --> 02:07:05,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1646
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:05,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1647
02:07:08,841 --> 02:07:09,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hey!

1648
02:07:09,461 --> 02:07:10,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't heard from you in a while.

1649
02:07:10,402 --> 02:07:12,763
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you doing?

1650
02:07:13,123 --> 02:07:13,944
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

1651
02:07:15,384 --> 02:07:16,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it.

1652
02:07:21,803 --> 02:07:23,764
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's gotten a lot of controversy.

1653
02:07:24,164 --> 02:07:26,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Gal Gun for the Xbox 360.

1654
02:07:27,326 --> 02:07:29,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Gal Gun, okay, okay.

1655
02:07:29,267 --> 02:07:29,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Set the stage.

1656
02:07:29,968 --> 02:07:31,468
[SPEAKER_09]: What type of game is Gal Gun?

1657
02:07:33,069 --> 02:07:37,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Gal Gun is a very perverted shooter.

1658
02:07:37,552 --> 02:07:40,233
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like a dating sim shooter, I should say.

1659
02:07:40,473 --> 02:07:41,914
[SPEAKER_03]: All dating sims should be shooters.

1660
02:07:42,414 --> 02:07:43,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1661
02:07:43,895 --> 02:07:45,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm interested so far.

1662
02:07:46,437 --> 02:07:50,639
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's gotten a lot of controversy because Microsoft

1663
02:07:52,032 --> 02:07:55,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I posted a video in the chat room.

1664
02:07:55,434 --> 02:07:59,377
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of panty shots and a lot of questionable material in it.

1665
02:08:00,437 --> 02:08:04,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So a friend of mine has a Japanese 360, so he bought it.

1666
02:08:06,241 --> 02:08:10,384
[SPEAKER_07]: And we played it, and I felt immediately dirty afterwards.

1667
02:08:14,275 --> 02:08:15,956
[SPEAKER_03]: You spray your love on them, by the way.

1668
02:08:20,198 --> 02:08:21,799
[SPEAKER_09]: This game looks disgusting.

1669
02:08:22,099 --> 02:08:24,880
[SPEAKER_09]: This looks like Elebits, but with girls.

1670
02:08:25,881 --> 02:08:26,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Little school girls.

1671
02:08:28,622 --> 02:08:30,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure they're all 18 or over, I'm sure.

1672
02:08:30,363 --> 02:08:31,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, of course, of course.

1673
02:08:32,084 --> 02:08:38,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And you also get to shoot teachers and all that, so... This looks like Elebits.

1674
02:08:38,187 --> 02:08:39,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this like Elebits?

1675
02:08:39,767 --> 02:08:40,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that game on the Wii?

1676
02:08:42,476 --> 02:08:44,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what the funny thing when you mention that is?

1677
02:08:44,477 --> 02:08:53,342
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole game has the feeling of a Wii game that was rejected, but it was put out on the 360.

1678
02:08:53,803 --> 02:08:54,523
[SPEAKER_09]: They wouldn't give up.

1679
02:08:54,883 --> 02:09:00,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so usually games like this end up being crappy, and you said you felt dirty afterwards.

1680
02:09:00,666 --> 02:09:02,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Was she tied up by a plant?

1681
02:09:02,367 --> 02:09:03,288
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell was that?

1682
02:09:03,308 --> 02:09:04,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Tentacles!

1683
02:09:05,389 --> 02:09:07,370
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a boss battle in it.

1684
02:09:07,410 --> 02:09:08,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the whole thing is centered around

1685
02:09:09,890 --> 02:09:12,731
[SPEAKER_07]: When you start the game, you have to choose a girl that you're interested in.

1686
02:09:13,251 --> 02:09:17,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the whole thing is you're trying to go through your high school and all that to try to get with this girl.

1687
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:25,134
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to go through all these women who are going after you, hitting you with postcards, fans, you know, typical anime stuff.

1688
02:09:25,634 --> 02:09:27,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness, postcards.

1689
02:09:28,255 --> 02:09:29,575
[SPEAKER_03]: He might get a paper cut.

1690
02:09:30,536 --> 02:09:30,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1691
02:09:31,656 --> 02:09:39,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to use a gun that shoots pheromones at the teenage girls

1692
02:09:40,359 --> 02:09:42,781
[SPEAKER_07]: that makes them drop down in ecstasy.

1693
02:09:43,521 --> 02:09:44,722
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like your love gun.

1694
02:09:45,843 --> 02:09:46,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a love gun.

1695
02:09:47,104 --> 02:09:47,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

1696
02:09:47,624 --> 02:09:55,250
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, there's a special mode where you can zero in on a girl and shoot her at specific parts of her body.

1697
02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:57,691
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's like a Fallout 3 mode?

1698
02:09:59,012 --> 02:10:00,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there is.

1699
02:10:00,814 --> 02:10:08,319
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, there'll be parts where she'll try to stop you if you're zeroing in on certain things and

1700
02:10:08,618 --> 02:10:11,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you allowed to shoot these girls in the butt or do they not like that?

1701
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:13,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you can shoot them in the butt.

1702
02:10:13,241 --> 02:10:19,105
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, it's funny because the game is so dynamic that different girls have different hot spots, I should say.

1703
02:10:22,347 --> 02:10:26,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Where you get an ecstasy bonus, as it's called.

1704
02:10:29,110 --> 02:10:29,610
[SPEAKER_09]: It's both.

1705
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:31,090
[SPEAKER_09]: It's both.

1706
02:10:31,211 --> 02:10:37,093
[SPEAKER_07]: It's essentially both because it's just so fucked up.

1707
02:10:37,113 --> 02:10:37,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

1708
02:10:38,293 --> 02:10:39,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking at it.

1709
02:10:40,134 --> 02:10:43,836
[SPEAKER_07]: The people who made this game made a lot of kids' games.

1710
02:10:43,876 --> 02:10:45,156
[SPEAKER_07]: They made, you know, the X-Men Zero series.

1711
02:10:45,176 --> 02:10:45,876
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually made Mega Man 9 and 10.

1712
02:10:45,916 --> 02:10:46,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess so.

1713
02:10:46,337 --> 02:10:47,817
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, the whole thing is, you know, it's very...

1714
02:10:57,731 --> 02:10:58,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Ridiculous.

1715
02:10:58,192 --> 02:11:02,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, it's kind of tough to play because it's a dating sim and it's all in Japanese.

1716
02:11:02,458 --> 02:11:04,621
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no English and it's never going to come in America.

1717
02:11:04,661 --> 02:11:09,067
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're kind of guessing through the whole thing.

1718
02:11:09,087 --> 02:11:12,352
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of mini-games and bonus stages that are ridiculous, but

1719
02:11:13,157 --> 02:11:13,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, was that sheep?

1720
02:11:13,937 --> 02:11:15,258
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck?

1721
02:11:52,331 --> 02:11:54,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, I think you need to bring a copy of this to the show one night.

1722
02:11:54,713 --> 02:11:56,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, it's episode 400 next week.

1723
02:11:56,234 --> 02:11:56,734
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you say?

1724
02:11:58,115 --> 02:12:02,097
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to import one of these real quick and get it over here to the show.

1725
02:12:03,138 --> 02:12:03,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Expedite the shipping.

1726
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:06,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so anyhow.

1727
02:12:09,482 --> 02:12:12,124
[SPEAKER_07]: That's bad, you know, I had to take a long bath after this just to

1728
02:12:14,287 --> 02:12:21,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure those girls have to take a long bath too to wash what they got off I'm watching them shoot the teachers I want this game I totally want this game I totally think you should get a game

1729
02:12:30,248 --> 02:12:30,568
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1730
02:12:30,969 --> 02:12:34,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the call, Matt, and bringing this game into our lives.

1731
02:12:35,171 --> 02:12:35,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

1732
02:12:35,912 --> 02:12:36,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1733
02:12:37,713 --> 02:12:37,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

1734
02:12:38,113 --> 02:12:38,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I missed.

1735
02:12:38,533 --> 02:12:38,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

1736
02:12:38,734 --> 02:12:39,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I accidentally hung up on him early.

1737
02:12:39,794 --> 02:12:40,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Matt.

1738
02:12:40,395 --> 02:12:40,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't mean to.

1739
02:12:41,355 --> 02:12:41,635
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1740
02:12:41,655 --> 02:12:44,517
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange National Radio.

1741
02:12:44,557 --> 02:12:45,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Akuma JP says, just kidding.

1742
02:12:45,998 --> 02:12:46,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen it.

1743
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:48,640
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

1744
02:12:49,180 --> 02:12:50,921
[SPEAKER_09]: It does totally look like a rejected Wii game.

1745
02:12:51,522 --> 02:12:51,902
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1746
02:12:52,442 --> 02:12:54,063
[SPEAKER_09]: We got time for a couple more calls, I suppose.

1747
02:12:56,625 --> 02:12:58,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you had another story for us, Loki?

1748
02:12:58,066 --> 02:12:58,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1749
02:12:58,937 --> 02:13:14,038
[SPEAKER_03]: uh just real quick stuff uh no Kid Icarus or Zelda until after E3 yeah DarkSakura did report on that you were probably playing Grand Theft Auto no I wasn't playing Grand Theft Auto you were playing Gal Gun I was not playing Gal Gun um

1750
02:13:16,195 --> 02:13:17,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, let's see here.

1751
02:13:18,117 --> 02:13:25,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, we have like, Atlas is bringing out Divinity 2, the Dragon Knight Saga, which is kind of an update to Divinity 2 with all the extra bonuses.

1752
02:13:26,003 --> 02:13:29,807
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out in May or April.

1753
02:13:30,407 --> 02:13:34,791
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, there was some chatter earlier that accused me of never listening to Loki.

1754
02:13:35,251 --> 02:13:37,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to point out it's been proven it goes both ways.

1755
02:13:38,454 --> 02:13:39,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I never listen to any of them.

1756
02:13:42,657 --> 02:13:43,778
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called multitasking.

1757
02:13:43,798 --> 02:13:50,403
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how we do this live show where we interact with the chat room, talk to each other, and take calls like the call we have on the line right now.

1758
02:13:50,463 --> 02:13:51,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1759
02:13:51,364 --> 02:13:51,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1760
02:13:51,724 --> 02:13:56,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

1761
02:13:56,567 --> 02:13:57,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is excellent.

1762
02:13:57,448 --> 02:13:58,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, how are you, buddy?

1763
02:14:00,478 --> 02:14:01,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good.

1764
02:14:01,258 --> 02:14:04,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to say now.

1765
02:14:04,219 --> 02:14:06,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm flabbergasted compared to that last caller.

1766
02:14:06,459 --> 02:14:08,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's just a one-up that I don't know if I can do that.

1767
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:12,800
[SPEAKER_09]: You're becoming like the Ranma of the new year.

1768
02:14:12,860 --> 02:14:14,241
[SPEAKER_09]: You're getting on the show every week.

1769
02:14:14,921 --> 02:14:15,521
[SPEAKER_09]: That's interesting.

1770
02:14:15,561 --> 02:14:18,341
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, if no one else is calling in... No, I try not to.

1771
02:14:20,602 --> 02:14:25,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't try to call unless one, you need to call, or two, I have something to call in about.

1772
02:14:25,083 --> 02:14:25,343
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1773
02:14:25,383 --> 02:14:26,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what does it happen to be tonight?

1774
02:14:26,783 --> 02:14:27,123
[SPEAKER_09]: One or two?

1775
02:14:30,141 --> 02:14:31,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, two actually.

1776
02:14:31,283 --> 02:14:32,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, what do you have to talk about today?

1777
02:14:32,804 --> 02:14:33,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about the, uh, next gen.

1778
02:14:34,046 --> 02:14:34,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

1779
02:14:34,647 --> 02:14:35,768
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people talking about that today.

1780
02:14:35,788 --> 02:14:38,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the fact that, I think the price point's even scaring me.

1781
02:14:38,431 --> 02:14:39,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I like what they...

1782
02:14:40,606 --> 02:15:06,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was going to say, a lot of the things I liked when I saw, when I was watching the coverage as it came out, and I liked a little bit that I saw, and the fact that I could actually have a handheld that plays quality games of that of, like, the PS3, would be absolutely amazing, but the price point, the fact that I know it's going to come out, it's going to be like, oh, it's $799 or $800, so that's what's going to scare me more than anything.

1783
02:15:06,844 --> 02:15:07,425
[SPEAKER_01]: That one would be like...

1784
02:15:07,965 --> 02:15:13,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm going to have to put that on the back burner for like three years before getting in and trying to catch up with everybody else.

1785
02:15:14,270 --> 02:15:16,371
[SPEAKER_03]: It will never sell if it's over $500.

1786
02:15:18,533 --> 02:15:22,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, this is the perfect time for us to kind of take a step back.

1787
02:15:23,056 --> 02:15:27,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hop in the time machine and go back to five years ago, 2006.

1788
02:15:27,259 --> 02:15:29,000
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready?

1789
02:15:29,601 --> 02:15:33,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in 2006, it was the Sony E3 press conference.

02:15:33,203 --> 02:15:33,483
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready?

02:15:50,558 --> 02:16:01,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridge Racer Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.

1795
02:16:02,566 --> 02:16:04,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's this giant enemy crab.

[SPEAKER_02]: Ridge Racer.

1797
02:16:07,988 --> 02:16:11,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And you attack its weak point for massive damage.

1798
02:16:12,089 --> 02:16:13,009
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Ridge Racer.

1799
02:16:14,229 --> 02:16:15,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Ridge Racer.

1807
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:16,201
[SPEAKER_03]: But the 3DS version is basically the same as Ridge Racer 7 and Ridge Racer 6.

1808
02:17:17,381 --> 02:17:19,641
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not even putting any new effort into it.

1809
02:17:19,661 --> 02:17:21,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, eh, let's put the game over.

1810
02:17:24,204 --> 02:17:24,604
[SPEAKER_09]: New cars?

1811
02:17:24,724 --> 02:17:24,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Nah.

1812
02:17:25,204 --> 02:17:26,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's port the game over.

1813
02:17:26,285 --> 02:17:29,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Exometer Charm thinks that'll cost 599 US crabs.

1814
02:17:31,766 --> 02:17:31,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1815
02:17:31,986 --> 02:17:34,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are historically accurate crabs.

1816
02:17:34,087 --> 02:17:35,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I'm sorry, X-Link.

1817
02:17:35,507 --> 02:17:37,048
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting away from what you wanted to talk about.

1818
02:17:40,409 --> 02:17:41,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Did he hang... X-Link?

1819
02:17:41,229 --> 02:17:42,089
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it's better right.

1820
02:17:42,109 --> 02:17:51,152
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to keep it too long because it sounds like our connection is getting pretty bad here, so... Uh, well, so... No, I just wanted to say that, though, because, you know, a lot of people, you know, like, I'm in between jobs right now.

1821
02:17:51,272 --> 02:17:52,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have $599 to spend.

1822
02:17:56,067 --> 02:18:00,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a job and I don't have $599 US dollars to spend.

1823
02:18:01,590 --> 02:18:04,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little freaked out.

1824
02:18:05,252 --> 02:18:07,873
[SPEAKER_09]: This thing better blow me if it's going to be that much money.

1825
02:18:07,993 --> 02:18:10,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I better just do more than that.

1826
02:18:11,695 --> 02:18:12,276
[SPEAKER_01]: My God.

1827
02:18:13,596 --> 02:18:15,858
[SPEAKER_09]: This thing better come with a love gun or something.

1828
02:18:15,938 --> 02:18:16,378
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1829
02:18:18,490 --> 02:18:25,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, if they port Gal Gun to the NGP, yeah, I want it to talk dirty to me for $590.

1830
02:18:27,102 --> 02:18:31,088
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's a Gal Gun on the NGP, then I might be able to be talked into it.

1831
02:18:31,248 --> 02:18:31,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1832
02:18:33,476 --> 02:18:59,369
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going to be a fun year nonetheless for E3 and it's going to be a lot of fun because this is going to be probably the year of let's see who won the up to and what category and what area so yeah this is going to be a lot of fun is he shooting his love pheromones into that plant's mouth alright X-Link I'm sorry they're still fascinated with Gal Gun so I gotta let you go but have a good night and thanks for calling no problem

1833
02:19:02,751 --> 02:19:04,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, poor Inks fall on her from Ragnarok.

1834
02:19:05,212 --> 02:19:06,253
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Gal Gun!

1835
02:19:06,653 --> 02:19:08,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Gal Gun!

1836
02:19:11,615 --> 02:19:13,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Now everybody in chat's just being dirty.

1837
02:19:14,437 --> 02:19:15,437
[SPEAKER_09]: You're all being dirty.

1838
02:19:16,057 --> 02:19:19,359
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, Fleshlight attachment coming in June 2012.

1839
02:19:19,879 --> 02:19:22,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, since you all are being dirty, let me bring this up.

1840
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:22,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you, um...

1841
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:31,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you all heard of that show, My Strange Obsession, that's on TLC, the network that brings you hoarders and intervention?

1842
02:19:31,366 --> 02:19:34,308
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's got midgets or multiple kids, it's on our network.

1843
02:19:35,390 --> 02:19:41,235
[SPEAKER_09]: TLC now has the show My Strange Obsession where they like to show things like there was the chick that ate couch material.

1844
02:19:41,335 --> 02:19:41,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1845
02:19:41,715 --> 02:19:43,316
[SPEAKER_09]: She had to eat the foam inside couches.

1846
02:19:43,877 --> 02:19:45,378
[SPEAKER_09]: A chick that slept with her blow dryer.

1847
02:19:45,418 --> 02:19:45,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Saw that.

1848
02:19:46,118 --> 02:19:53,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this week, or maybe it was this last week, I don't know, they are going to have a guy who is infatuated with his real doll.

1849
02:19:54,965 --> 02:19:58,847
[SPEAKER_09]: his love doll that believes he is married to it or something like that.

1850
02:19:58,907 --> 02:20:00,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the deal was.

1851
02:20:00,308 --> 02:20:05,030
[SPEAKER_09]: It was something like he treats the doll like it's a real person and sleeps with it at night.

1852
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:06,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that a movie?

1853
02:20:07,051 --> 02:20:08,752
[SPEAKER_09]: This is real life, apparently.

1854
02:20:08,952 --> 02:20:10,413
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not like Weekend at Bernie's.

1855
02:20:10,433 --> 02:20:11,053
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the real deal.

1856
02:20:11,073 --> 02:20:11,413
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't.

1857
02:20:11,573 --> 02:20:15,315
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a, remember it was with, I don't remember the guy's name.

1858
02:20:15,415 --> 02:20:17,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Nah, I think I know which one.

1859
02:20:17,396 --> 02:20:20,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that Simone about the virtual chick that comes to life?

1860
02:20:20,737 --> 02:20:21,518
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

1861
02:20:21,538 --> 02:20:23,439
[SPEAKER_04]: De Niro was in that, but that movie went straight to video.

1862
02:20:23,679 --> 02:20:23,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1863
02:20:24,011 --> 02:20:28,892
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there was a movie about this guy who had a love doll or something like that.

1864
02:20:29,592 --> 02:20:34,373
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was him and the whole town kind of pretended it was real.

1865
02:20:35,914 --> 02:20:36,574
[SPEAKER_03]: For no reason.

1866
02:20:36,694 --> 02:20:38,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a dumbass movie.

1867
02:20:38,494 --> 02:20:39,635
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those fucking artsy films.

1868
02:20:39,655 --> 02:20:42,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1869
02:20:42,375 --> 02:20:44,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those things I was like, really?

1870
02:20:44,436 --> 02:20:45,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go see that.

1871
02:20:46,519 --> 02:20:47,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Something the wife made you watch?

1872
02:20:47,961 --> 02:20:49,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I forgot to mention!

1873
02:20:50,143 --> 02:20:50,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

1874
02:20:51,865 --> 02:20:53,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming Week, totally forgot.

1875
02:20:55,670 --> 02:21:01,517
[SPEAKER_03]: This week we had this kind of a kickoff for the 2011 year type thing.

1876
02:21:01,557 --> 02:21:02,098
[SPEAKER_03]: They do like a

1877
02:21:03,827 --> 02:21:08,210
[SPEAKER_03]: People from different branches out and stuff, and they're doing these team-building events and stuff like that.

1878
02:21:08,330 --> 02:21:10,691
[SPEAKER_09]: From Salacious Pop, Lance and the Real Girl.

1879
02:21:10,931 --> 02:21:11,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's it.

1880
02:21:11,711 --> 02:21:12,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1881
02:21:12,972 --> 02:21:15,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, because I'm too lazy to look that up.

1882
02:21:15,894 --> 02:21:23,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had a bunch of Connect Adventure games that we were competing in teams for high scores, and we win stuff.

1883
02:21:25,239 --> 02:21:26,119
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to say...

1884
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:31,902
[SPEAKER_03]: That two out of the three days, we kicked the crap out of everybody.

1885
02:21:32,422 --> 02:21:39,445
[SPEAKER_03]: The third day, or actually I should say the first day, we would have won had we played together, both myself and my co-worker.

1886
02:21:40,265 --> 02:21:43,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, we were on separate teams with other people, which is why we lost.

1887
02:21:43,546 --> 02:21:47,468
[SPEAKER_03]: But we won like $80 worth of movie passes.

1888
02:21:49,173 --> 02:21:51,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, what movie are you taking me to?

1889
02:21:52,015 --> 02:22:03,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we don't go to see movies very often, so when we do go, we're going to get popcorn, hot dogs, $60 in bulk candy.

1890
02:22:03,964 --> 02:22:07,226
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a matter of time before your kid's going to want to go see every Disney movie.

1891
02:22:07,486 --> 02:22:09,708
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe a couple years, but still.

1892
02:22:09,748 --> 02:22:10,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a couple years.

1893
02:22:11,869 --> 02:22:14,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought it was funny that we kicked the crap out of you.

1894
02:22:14,111 --> 02:22:15,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, you're the video game team.

1895
02:22:15,672 --> 02:22:17,093
[SPEAKER_09]: You're supposed to kick the crap out of them.

1896
02:22:18,334 --> 02:22:18,594
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1897
02:22:18,674 --> 02:22:19,114
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

1898
02:22:19,455 --> 02:22:21,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1899
02:22:21,175 --> 02:22:22,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys who got through.

1900
02:22:22,396 --> 02:22:27,778
[SPEAKER_09]: If you didn't get through, you can always email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1901
02:22:27,838 --> 02:22:29,979
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show tonight.

1902
02:22:30,559 --> 02:22:34,160
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little early, but I guess it wasn't outside of the NGP.

1903
02:22:34,861 --> 02:22:35,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a whole lot to say.

1904
02:22:36,221 --> 02:22:38,482
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1905
02:22:38,722 --> 02:22:39,983
[SPEAKER_09]: We can just have an extra long afterbirth.

1906
02:22:40,523 --> 02:22:41,824
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

1907
02:22:45,734 --> 02:22:49,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, and by the way, the chat room is yelling it's actually Lars and the real girl, not Lance.

1908
02:22:49,899 --> 02:22:52,702
[SPEAKER_09]: And SalaciousPop says, it's actually really good, thank you very much.

1909
02:22:53,343 --> 02:22:54,324
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard it was actually good.

1910
02:22:54,364 --> 02:22:54,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1911
02:22:54,905 --> 02:22:55,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I just looked dumb.

1912
02:22:56,647 --> 02:22:56,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1913
02:22:59,610 --> 02:22:59,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1914
02:23:00,932 --> 02:23:01,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1915
02:23:02,594 --> 02:23:05,918
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought tonight is, it's like I'm walking on sunshine.

1916
02:23:06,636 --> 02:23:07,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

1917
02:23:08,056 --> 02:23:16,678
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I never would have thought that Pandora would introduce me to a bunch of awesome music that I never would have heard of thanks to Pandora.

1918
02:23:17,198 --> 02:23:22,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it also introduced me to a lot of crappy music and music that I've heard of numerous times.

1919
02:23:23,060 --> 02:23:31,082
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a little difficult to hit the thumbs up and thumbs down while driving my car.

1920
02:23:31,562 --> 02:23:31,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

1921
02:23:32,762 --> 02:23:32,962
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1922
02:23:32,982 --> 02:23:35,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.

1923
02:23:35,544 --> 02:23:40,406
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask you guys, tell a couple people about our show.

1924
02:23:40,607 --> 02:23:42,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Word of mouth is how we spread the word.

1925
02:23:42,247 --> 02:23:43,908
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how we've been doing it for the past nine years.

1926
02:23:44,229 --> 02:23:50,172
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not able to advertise in video game magazines or have E3 booths or have any of that.

1927
02:23:50,192 --> 02:23:53,194
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have a full-fledged team bringing news to you.

1928
02:23:53,254 --> 02:23:54,434
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't our day jobs.

1929
02:23:54,875 --> 02:23:58,697
[SPEAKER_09]: We work very hard with balancing our family lives and all that stuff in this show.

1930
02:23:58,757 --> 02:23:59,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all we ask.

1931
02:23:59,577 --> 02:24:00,378
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a pity story.

1932
02:24:00,678 --> 02:24:01,058
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1933
02:24:20,703 --> 02:24:23,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you're like, I hate every single show on all games.

1934
02:24:23,246 --> 02:24:23,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.

1935
02:24:24,087 --> 02:24:25,148
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a real picky bitch.

1936
02:24:25,469 --> 02:24:28,292
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's got to be something in the indie universe that's for you.

1937
02:24:28,312 --> 02:24:29,674
[SPEAKER_09]: So support independent podcasting.

1938
02:24:30,054 --> 02:24:30,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, guys.

1939
02:24:31,096 --> 02:24:31,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a wonderful week.

1940
02:24:31,876 --> 02:24:33,879
[SPEAKER_09]: We will see you back here next week for episode number...

1941
02:24:34,923 --> 02:24:35,804
[SPEAKER_09]: 400 OMG.

1942
02:24:36,364 --> 02:24:37,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Until then, good night.

1943
02:25:01,733 --> 02:25:05,635
[SPEAKER_05]: or AllGames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

1944
02:25:06,216 --> 02:25:07,036
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next week!
