11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is episode number 399 for January 30th, 2011.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games with the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hi.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hi, how are you?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I am doing better than I was.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, I've heard you've been kind of sick lately. I'm sorry to hear about it.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, but I has warm drink. Thank you.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, you're welcome.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And I have my fuzzy blue binky.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Not a Snuggie, but it kind of looks like one from far away.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's very soft fleece and I think that I got this as a freebie from somewhere, but it's been super soft and goes with me on trips.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And it's like my comfort blanket.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Have you ever thought about investing in a Snuggie?

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I saw one once. It was a knockoff with Kingdom Hearts patterns all over it. It did make me think of you a little bit.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't know. I like my blanket. If it was the same softness as this blanket. See, my blanket's really soft.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, this is great radio, me feeling the blanket. Yes, there you go.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If it was just like this blanket, then maybe I could be convinced. But I kind of like being shrouded in my warm blanket and being able to pull it over my head if I want to.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is it like a Linus from the Peanuts thing where it's like your security blanket has to go with you everywhere?

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, no. But it makes me feel comforted when I feel weak and sick. And then I can use my really low warm blanket.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I just realized I touched that blanket when you were sick. I really hope I don't get it.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's been washed, Rob.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Alright, let's also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hi.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How are you, Loki?

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sick as well.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, no.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I caught my son's cold.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh my gosh.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The plague.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's alright.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I feel like I'm marked because I haven't been sick yet. Dot, dot, dot. I really hope I don't get anything.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, sorry to hear about you being sick as well. I hope you get over it.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, it's fine.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But I have to point out, just before the show started while Bobby's show was finishing up here live at All Games Radio, you were giggling like a schoolgirl over there playing, what was it, Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC?

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, episodes of Liberty City.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And it was really funny because you were listening to some gay dance music or something in the game while you were just blowing up.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, I was listening to the Russian electronic station in the game and then I was playing, well, I was working on map edits and then I decided, because I still have the crazy car handling in place still, that I'd play around with that, so that's what I was doing.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Gotcha.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well, it looked like you were having fun because you were giggling as your car was spinning around and around and around and around.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, you're not supposed to be able to get into those cars because they go crazy, but since I have the trainer, I can spawn cars and make it so I don't fall off of motorcycles and stuff. It's fun.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Alright, and also joining us tonight, of course, you guys, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, as they have over the past, what, nine years we've been doing this show.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com if you are listening to us live because we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And yes, we are doing a show next week, which is very brave because we are going to compete against Super Bowl Sunday in some ways. I don't know, I think most of it's wind down. I think they're in like the last quarter by the time this show starts.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But next week's kind of a big deal for us because it's episode number 400. I don't think we're going to do anything too special. We might have some surprises in store, little things, but you know, we don't want to do because then we could do, we could do a 400th special, then we could do a ninth anniversary special, then we could do a 10th anniversary, you know, we don't want to overdo it with the special.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I like 10 aversaries.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Every week is special. Dang it. So we appreciate you guys listening to us over the past few years. Really appreciate it.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We're going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com. Tigerclaw says, it's funny that Snuggies have taken off considering the Slanket was the first one to come up with the idea. And Jim Sally says, Snuggies now with 10% more Slanket.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So is Snuggie like the Zynga of the blanket making world? I don't know. Take with that what you will.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Alright, let's get into the show and talk about some video games and how is your gaming week and the types of video games you have been playing since you guys have been sick. I don't know if you guys have been playing some games, but let's see.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Dark Soccer, what have you been up to?

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I've really just played World of Warcraft. Addicts. Dealer. Because I hate Icecrown. And I hated it so much that I was like, I just need to power level through it, need to get through with it, need to get through with it. I'm done.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I have to thank Alan, by the way, for running me through that. I don't think it was a dungeon, but it was like some tournament area. And I think it was in Zildrak.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh yeah, the Ring of Blood or whatever it's called.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I could get the Slobberknocker. But it got me a crap ton of experience on top of it. So that saved me a couple hours of work and stupid quests to control water elementals, which sucked. And now I just did the joust thing.

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, there's a little parody. And she's not talking like an actual joust thing, although that's in the game too.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You ride a griffin.

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But there's like a make-believe 3D version of the old school 80s game, joust.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And you get a pet from it that's one of the little griffins with a dude on it with a lance. And you get to keep the lance. Although I'm gonna sell it for probably nothing that's worse. It's like a zero to one damage item, which makes me laugh.

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And I'm actually having a really good time in the really pretty Cataclysm area. It's just really pretty.

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Flowers and fairy dragons. I love fairy dragons. And I'll tell you why I love fairy dragons. From D&D.

72
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
My friend played a fairy dragon named Shimata Hentai. So I thought it was funny. And I'm done. I'm high on Sudafed.

73
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's gonna be a fun show!

74
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sudafed, Robitussin, and Benadryl.

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Do you find that, wow, I'm still blown away every week this goes on. That you were a wow hater in 2010.

76
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I wasn't a hater.

77
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes you were. You turned it all around in 2011.

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I wasn't a hater.

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay, you were a disliker.

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I was just bored by it.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Disliker's gonna dislike.

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, you know me. I'm gonna give something a chance before I decide that I hate it. And enough, like I said enough, people said it's different that I had to give it a chance.

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Speaking of MMOs, I gotta go to a comment from Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchrader.com.

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He says his gaming week pretty much consisted of playing DC Universe online. Still haven't reached level 30. I think I'm around level 16 or 15.

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So I've gotta kinda ask, are there any other MMOs? Cause I know you're a comic book, even though you're not so much DC. I know you're more of a Marvel girl.

86
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Do any of these other MMOs interest you? And you've talked also about maybe I need to go back to Star Trek Online and check out what's going on there.

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, I missed on Star Trek Online. And I do miss my fleet. They're cool guys.

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I do want to go back to Star Trek Online for a month to see the new episodes. But I don't know. I mean, it really got to be super redundant.

89
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And there's been enough different stuff going on in World of Warcraft that I think it's gonna keep my attention.

90
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Cause I just get bored doing the same thing over and over again. Which is why I was really, really bored in Icecrown.

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Except, I mean, once I got through all the cool Arthas stuff, I was like, ugh, boring. And I forgot to make him dance. See if I can make him dance.

92
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But, um, I've liked all the little neat throwing stuff and I really haven't had enough of that in Star Trek Online.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm gonna give it another go. I mean, I love Star Trek Online. It was fun. I love everything about it. Except that I've run out of shit to do.

94
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Except the endgame got old, basically.

95
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, pretty much. And I don't like PVP. I hate PVP.

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm kinda curious what you're gonna think of the endgame a while because I know you haven't done a lot of the grouping.

97
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And to be honest, there's not a whole lot else to do. Well, I take that back. They've done a lot of stuff when it comes to reputations and crafting.

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And there's kinda that to do. There's a lot of daily quests you can do. But I worry you're gonna find yourself a little bored when you get to the endgame.

99
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Because even I'm getting a little bored at the endgame right now because our guild lost some people after the expansion just due to real life stuff.

100
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And we haven't had enough to do any of the raiding, which is the big stuff you do.

101
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Well, see, that's why I want you guys to show me the ropes. So that, you know, Wednesdays are gonna be bad.

102
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's the Rope Robot School of Warcraft!

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, Wednesdays are gonna be bad for me because I have school until 1030.

104
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But I wanna eventually get into it. You know, I got so wrapped up in questing and it was so much fun to me.

105
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And I've got a Worgen now.

106
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I gotta make my shopping list over here for WoW School. Okay, buy Sorting Hat for Jamie.

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I have a Worgen now though. Because while I was feeling so sick and miserable, Dan decided to cheer me up by getting me Cataclysm.

108
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And then promptly yelled at me for playing too much Warcraft.

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But I named her Veruca Salt. With two A's. Veruca Salt.

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Veruca! Alright.

111
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Because I couldn't get Volkswagen.

112
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Alright, enough MMO chat. Let's go over to Loki. I know he doesn't play any of them right now, so I'll ask him what he's been playing this week, Loki.

113
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I've been playing, um, not a whole lot actually. Just, you know, mainly like Grand Theft Auto stuff because that's fun.

114
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Just been dealing with... I had my JTAG system repaired and it died in five minutes when I got it back.

115
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So I was like, uh, that sucks. So I sent it away to get it fixed again.

116
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Um, I did play some stuff on the iPod yesterday actually. I played...

117
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And you may remember this from when we were talking about it during one...

118
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It was a news segment we brought up.

119
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The game Hamlet. Or was it the last game not to feature MMO shading and some other elements or something like that?

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I vaguely remember a story on this. So I remember making the comment like,

121
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
how in the hell are they gonna make a game out of that? That sounds...

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It was actually pretty awesome.

123
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Some college kids project gone pretty long.

124
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes. Hamlet or the last game without MMO RPG features, shaders, and product placement. HD was the game that I played.

125
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And, um, basically it's like a point and click adventure game, except really dumbed down. In a way.

126
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Um, it's dumbed down the fact that you don't have an inventory. You don't have any real exploration or anything.

127
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's just okay. It's one level, and then the next room you're in, and the next room you're in, and you have to solve a puzzle in each one.

128
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And there's about 20 some rooms.

129
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So I was able to finish the game in like three to four hours.

130
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But, um, it's really got a unique style to it. I mean, it's not...

131
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It is Hamlet, and it's not. It's like, um, if the creators of Ren and Stimpy created a version of Hamlet, it's basically that.

132
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's just weird.

133
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I love Ren and Stimpy. It's powdered toast, man!

134
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No, seriously, the art style kind of reminds me of, like, Ren and Stimpy. It's just very weird.

135
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay, now I'm interested.

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Um, but it's...

137
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Who from our generation didn't love Ren and Stimpy?

138
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, you play this, like, um...

139
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What rolls downstairs, hops over in pairs, runs over your neighbor's dog.

140
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You play this, like, time traveler or whatever who comes back to, I guess, Hamlet and accidentally crushes Hamlet, and he, you know, he's injured, so you have to basically do all the things Hamlet would have had to do.

141
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And they've already teased a sequel, which is gonna be Romeo and Juliet.

142
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hamlet 2?

143
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
There's gonna be Romeo and Juliet.

144
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Hamlet 2, Electric Boogaloo.

145
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Bummer, because the Hamlet 2 movie is one of those movies. I actually watched the movie. Do you know they have, like, a movie called Hamlet 2, and it's about a guy who's putting on stage? It's a comedy.

146
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And, like, it's actually not very funny, but it's one of those things that's, like, so stupid, you kind of laugh in some parts.

147
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Rock me, Rock me, Rock me, Jesus.

148
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah, Rock me, Sexy Jesus. Like, it's so absurd, you have to laugh, because this movie clearly was just set out to offend people. And that was kind of funny.

149
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Uh, but yeah, the game's pretty awesome. The only problem I have is that it's short, and once you've beaten it, there's really no reason to play it again.

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So...

151
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Is it a free game, though?

152
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No.

153
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh.

154
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But it's cheap.

155
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay. Well, as long as you kind of get what you pay for, so to speak.

156
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah. But it was a good game. It's just, it's, um, and some of the puzzles are pretty hard. You have to think about it, and they give you a little hint, but that hint sometimes doesn't really help you.

157
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Um, but you can usually figure it out pretty quick. I mean, I played the whole game through without using any sort of, you know, cheats or anything.

158
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Is Telltale in trouble? I mean, they are the kings of the whole point-and-clicky games right now.

159
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No, it's a little different than that.

160
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay.

161
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's more of like, you know, someone that hasn't really played an adventure game. I mean, it's very, okay, you solve this puzzle in this stage, you move to the next stage, and you solve this next puzzle, and they have little boss fights and stuff like that.

162
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay.

163
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And the boss fights are just very, very odd. The whole game is very odd.

164
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Spaznator's in our chatroom saying that he bought some Ren and Stimpy episodes via PSN. I had no idea. See, I wouldn't know what the hell was on the PSN video store if we didn't have Spaznator in our chatroom every week or on Twitter or wherever he's at, because I never pay attention to what's on it.

165
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I had no idea you could get Ren and Stimpy episodes. Can you even get those on Netflix? I don't even know. Like, I'm sure they're all on DVD, but they're probably all over YouTube as well. I don't know.

166
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
All right. Anything else for your gaming week you want to share with us, Loki?

167
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No, no, that would be it.

168
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay. My gaming week. Didn't play a whole lot of new stuff. I'm kind of having to penny-pinch right now, so I don't have a lot of money to spend $60 on new games, so it's kind of playing the games I have, which is WoW and some of the, you know, Xbox Live Arcade games.

169
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But this is funny that I'm going to talk about penny-pinch and then talk about what I just did this weekend. But I took, like, a real quick suicide trip to Disneyland. That's where I was the past couple days.

170
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's not why there wasn't a Hoard House this week, though. We had a plan, but unfortunately, Plan B fell through. We'll get to that on that show.

171
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:14,000
However, yeah, I went to Disneyland, and when I was there, part of the reason I wanted to go was to see this whole Electronica event that they had. They had a Tron-themed dance party rave that they turned a whole section of Disneyland into.

172
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And yes, this is video game related because they have several little attractions going on. Most of it is to just kind of draw people into California Adventure before World of Color starts, which is their big, big thing.

173
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And California Adventure is kind of the struggling Disney park right now. While it has a few big, big rides that people love, like Tower of Terror and California Screamin', there's not a lot of reason for people to, like, stay there like they do Disneyland.

174
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So Electronica's kind of a way to bring them in there. And they have a couple neat things. Like, they have a nine-minute preview of Tron Legacy, which is, you know, what you would expect to see in, like, a...

175
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They turn the Muppets Theater into the Tron Theater, which is kind of funny. But they do, like, lighting effects where when the recognizer comes out, the whole theater glows red. Kind of cute little things like that.

176
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But I'll tell you what was awesome and what has to do with gaming is that they took one of the old buildings that I believe way back in the day used to be the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire experience that didn't last very long.

177
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And that building's just been empty for the longest time. Well, guess what they turned it into? Flynn's Arcade. They have a replica of Flynn's Arcade complete with old-school 80s arcade games.

178
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And get this, because it's Disney and because, you know, everything has to work at Disneyland, it all works. Like, it's a classic arcade game where all these games feel like they're in, like, mint freaking condition.

179
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's fantastic.

180
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I know. Like, there's just not a lot like it. There's very few arcades that take good care of their retro machines like that.

181
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Did they say how long it's gonna be there?

182
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's guaranteed right now on the calendars through March 25th.

183
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That means we should be there when we go...

184
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But people are thinking, like, oh, maybe it's not gonna last through April when the Blu-ray's coming out. But my other thought is what are they gonna replace it with?

185
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Electronica replaced what they called Glowfest, which was the same type of thing, really. It just didn't have a Tron theme to it.

186
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And when you see the Tron stuff, it's pretty rad what they did. But there's not a whole lot else to see besides that classic arcade and everything.

187
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But it's crazy because this arcade is full of people. There is a freaking line to play the Tron game, which they have perfectly placed in the back with a little subtle cutout in the wall.

188
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Once in a while, you'll see things glowing behind. I mean, it's perfect, this replica they've set up.

189
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And they even created... This is the thing that just freaked me out. They created a game called Space Paranoids that they have in an arcade machine.

190
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And it's clearly running on a PC because it doesn't use tokens, but it's like in a cabinet. And it's like a 3D game where you go around and shoot recognizers, but you only have so many bullets.

191
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's pretty hot.

192
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I think that's their browser. They had a browser game that was like that.

193
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah, it's probably just the browser game like as an arcade machine, so that's what that is.

194
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And I played Dig Dug, which is one of my favorite classic games. Tease me if you will.

195
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But I walked out of there with the number one score on the machine, thank you very much.

196
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Nice.

197
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So yeah, I don't know if it resets every night or what, but hey, I was happy for a minute.

198
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So it's whatever makes you happy, I guess. Even some pinball! They had a Whirlwind machine. Or what is that called? The one that blows the air on you?

199
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah, that's Whirlwind.

200
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, pinball machine.

201
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's Whirlwind.

202
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, some of that too. And they play 80s music very loudly while you're in there.

203
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Lots of journey.

204
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes. Like I heard of Bananarama and some of the stuff. But every time they play Journey is when the arcade will start flickering and kind of doing that very Disney effect.

205
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
If you are anywhere near SoCal, you gotta see it. Like if you're an arcade enthusiast, you gotta see it.

206
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Like just at least once. It's a pretty cool thing to behold. I mean I can't say like it's a loan worth the, what is it, $90 price it costs for a one day park hopper or whatever.

207
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's pushing it. But if you're gonna be going to Disneyland anyway, you gotta like make sure you're gonna see this somehow.

208
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I really hope that they went to all this work, that they just keep it open. Like really, they weren't using that building for anything else.

209
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Just keep the damn thing open until you have something really, really good to replace it.

210
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Because it looks like they spent a lot of money converting that building into Flynn's arcade. Don't, I mean even if they're gonna end Electronica, keep the freaking arcade.

211
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't get rid of it. Please Disney.

212
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So, yeah. Folks in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchrader.com.

213
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Shezro says, wow, Flynn's replica. Nice. Yeah, I agree. It was pretty awesome.

214
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Let's see. Bochikawa says, that sounds awesome. It was pretty awesome. I mean it was crowded though. I mean, gosh.

215
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I only had time to really play like the one game. So there you go.

216
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Tigerclaw says, Skye, are they blasting the Daft Punk soundtrack all over the park?

217
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Actually, no. They don't. They do some of it, especially during the pre-show leading up to it.

218
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But you know, when the dance party's going on, it's mostly Top 40 remix stuff.

219
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But they have people decked out in Tron outfits that are like up there dancing.

220
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And I felt kind of cool because when I say cool, like this is like super nerdy.

221
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But I actually bought a replica identity disc that glows up when you hit a button on it.

222
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And I was like carrying that around with me and my friend Melody who I was there with.

223
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Because this is kind of our makeup trip from her birthday.

224
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
When the, I don't know if you remember this episode of OLR, when the plane caught on fire before us. Yeah.

225
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is our makeup trip because we didn't get to go that weekend.

226
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
She had two of the discs. One blue and one orange and like everybody was coming up to her asking her like where she got the discs.

227
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And it was just from the freaking souvenir stores. And you can get the blue ones at Target actually.

228
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
They have them at Toys R Us.

229
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah. So they're not hard to find but it's just kind of funny.

230
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So Zeba wants to know if I took any pics. Yes I did. I actually took some video too.

231
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So I'll try to kind of put that all into a compilation video and upload that to YouTube or something if you want to see.

232
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'll try to get that up later.

233
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Alright. Anyhow. So that was really it. That was Tigerclaw in our chat says top 40 music. Yuck.

234
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I actually, I might be misrepresenting a little bit. It's a lot of remixes of top 40 music.

235
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But Tigerclaw I know you like the electric and trance stuff and I think you would be happy with the stuff that they played.

236
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
They played some cool stuff.

237
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So I know my friend constantly had her phone out with SoundHound or whatever that program is that lets you identify songs.

238
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Like what's this electronic song? What's this song? So it's kind of a mix.

239
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Okay. Let's move on and actually get into the show itself.

240
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
First some housekeeping. Please follow us on Twitter.

241
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and also you can follow us on Facebook.

242
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

243
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Next week is the 400th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

244
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
We'll be starting at 6 o'clock Pacific promptly 9 o'clock Eastern.

245
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Bobby actually has the night off due to this.

246
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
There's some football game that people care about here that a lot of people are apparently going to be watching.

247
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And we have the balls to go up against it.

248
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But if you must listen on the podcast feed then I suppose you can join us there too.

249
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But it'll be more fun I promise if you join us live next week for the 400th episode of O-L-R.

250
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Alright let's get into tonight's gaming news.

251
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
There was some big stuff. Big conferences. Things to talk about right, Loki?

252
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yes. The big thing of course is talking about the NGP.

253
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And the NGP is what I guess Sony is calling what everybody's pretty much dubbed the PSP2.

254
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And it is one sexy looking piece of equipment there.

255
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Of course they had a lot of the stuff that was rumored to be in there.

256
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's carrying a 5 inch OLED screen with pretty high resolution on it.

257
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Four times the PSPs.

258
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
A front touch screen.

259
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
A rear touch pad.

260
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
3G Wi-Fi.

261
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Bluetooth.

262
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
GPS.

263
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Dual analog sticks.

264
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And looks pretty awesome.

265
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So yeah I've got to get one.

266
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
They didn't really give a price point.

267
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It is supposed to be out at least in one region before the end of the year.

268
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And I guess it looks like both the front and rear little touch pads are multi-touch.

269
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It does have a front and rear camera as well.

270
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Built in microphone. Of course it's also got 6 axis motion sensing.

271
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Including a 3 axis gyroscope, 3 axis accelerometer, and 3 axis electronic compass.

272
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Wait. You said something that I think I just totally missed during the press conference.

273
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You said built in microphone?

274
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yes.

275
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Is there a built in camera on this too?

276
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Two. Front and back.

277
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh this thing is going to have video conferencing then no question.

278
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And that's something they didn't even really advertise.

279
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Interesting. There's no other reason to put a front camera on the damn thing than to have some type of competing FaceTime technology or whatever you want to call it.

280
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Something like that yeah.

281
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And then Bluetooth and all sorts of other stuff.

282
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But I'm pretty excited about it.

283
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I mean a bunch of things I know they were mentioning of course it's going to be backwards compatible with PSP games like digital games so you can play PSP games on there.

284
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
PlayStation 1 games.

285
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yeah but wait a minute what if I have the games on UMD am I just kind of screwed?

286
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yep.

287
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So it's compatible with PSP GO games?

288
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But you'll be able to play that stuff on there and I would imagine that it's going to be fully compatible with the PlayStation 1 stuff now because now you have the dual analog sticks.

289
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And they're saying that they're full analog sticks so I'm not sure if you can click down on them for the L3 and R3 stuff.

290
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But as far as like the L2 buttons that right there is your back little touch pad you know you can just the right half is the right button the right the left half is the left button.

291
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And then the shoulder buttons could be for everything else since I'd assume the multi touch stuff is probably going to be also pressure sensitive so that would be kind of sort of analog.

292
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But that's pretty awesome and it looks very similar to what you know the normal PSP 3000 looks like right now.

293
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:28,000
They're going to also have I guess there's some some special slots for memory and games and stuff like that because obviously they're not using this type of rounds can be a proprietary format for both so it'll take just a little bit longer the crack I guess.

294
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And then of course they were talking about some of the games that are going to be out for it as well.

295
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Some of the games in the works Uncharted Killzone Resistance LittleBigPlanet and the game called Little Deviants which looks like the first kind of original game for the system.

296
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Obviously you know most of their I'd say all of their big franchise games are going to be coming out there.

297
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
They did show Uncharted which is kind of interesting because Uncharted they had it where you could play it just like a normal PS3 game you know with the dual analog 6 and stuff like that.

298
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Or you could actually play it with kind of like the touch panel like you could tap stuff and you know go to different spots.

299
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So I guess trying to appeal to you know both hardcore gamer and casual you know phone gamer or whatever.

300
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Other things that they were talking about coming out Call of Duty a game called Broken Gravity Days Hot Shots Golf Hustle Kings which is the billiards game.

301
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Reality Fighters which is kind of an augmented reality fighting game which is kind of weird.

302
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Resistance Smart As which sounds like a trivia game and Wipe Out.

303
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That's not smart ass that's smart as.

304
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Smart as.

305
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Like smart as a 5th grader or something like that.

306
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Gotcha.

307
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I suppose.

308
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Interesting.

309
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Well they didn't name a price or a date but if you thought they were going to do that this early then you know you were kind of wishful thinking.

310
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Because you know E3 is really the time to do that and let's face it when Nintendo first unveiled the 3DS they didn't say any of that either.

311
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
They just came out with the price and date what two months ago and now it's coming out in March.

312
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So or no last month and it's coming out in March.

313
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Are we talking about price and date for the 3DS?

314
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah it just came out a couple weeks ago.

315
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Sorry I meant two months out of the actual release was when the dates came out.

316
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So to think that Sony was going to release the release date of this and the price and everything now 11 months before release or whatever was a little bit no.

317
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I bet they don't even know what it's going to cost yet.

318
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
They're probably trying to gauge the whole consumer reaction or also the price technology.

319
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I mean it goes down so rapidly so who knows.

320
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Price is kind of important obviously. I think it's too early to say if I really want to get one or not.

321
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I think it really depends on what's all there when it comes out.

322
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm definitely getting one just because I have store credit for the Sony store.

323
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So $280 of that's already spoken for.

324
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So as long as it's not like something stupid or ridiculous like $400 or even $400 might not be that bad with you know $280 taken out of the way.

325
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm actually thinking $400 might not be completely out of the realm of possibility.

326
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't think it's going to be $400 because it would be hard to justify a handheld system being more expensive than a console system.

327
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Well here's the thing. You got to look at its competition.

328
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I understand that.

329
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I don't mean the 3DS.

330
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I know what you're talking about.

331
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
The iPad.

332
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And the iPad with 3G is what? $650 for the latest model?

333
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah but here's the thing.

334
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Unless Sony wants to take the what I consider douchebaggy route of well you're paying for the Sony product.

335
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
The Sony name or level of you know wonderful that's in all of our products.

336
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Apple may be able to get away with that because people have you know drank the Kool-Aid.

338
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I mean honestly if I didn't get that iPod for free I would not be buying an iPod.

339
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And I sure as hell am not buying an iPad.

340
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm sorry but you know that may be if they want to play that gamble then go ahead.

341
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But I think it's going to end up flopping on them just like you know the PSP Go.

342
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Although this will be a little bit easier of an argument because it's you know a new system and stuff.

343
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But you know they're talking that there's probably going to be multiple SKUs on it.

344
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
One for a 3G one for Wi-Fi.

345
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Personally I'd just pick up the Wi-Fi one because I don't want a fucking another data plan.

346
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Exactly.

347
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Tethered to my fucking phone that's what I'm going to do.

348
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I in dark he's gay in our chat room is dying for an educated guess from us gaming analysts.

349
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Maha Maha Maha wants to know an educated guess for the price.

350
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'll give you my best guess.

351
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm going to say three hundred dollars without 3G and four hundred dollars with it.

352
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I think that's I think considering the level of technology they're trying to put in this thing and all these other little features and stuff.

353
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I think that's not outside the realm of possibility.

354
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
However one big big wild card to keep in mind is Apple's next iPad.

355
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Which they're going to have a big announcement and they're going to release it within the next couple months.

356
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I mean that's you don't have to be an Apple psychic to know that.

357
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So if they manage to really cut the cost of those things that could make Sony have to kind of do a counter move.

358
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But seeing as I don't want to go too far out off base here.

359
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But I believe those new iPads will probably have the same retina display that the iPhone 4's are using right now.

360
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And it's going to make those things absolutely gorgeous.

361
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
They'll probably still be charging at least six hundred dollars if you want an iPad with 3GS.

362
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So we'll see.

363
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So Sony can still at least be cheaper than an iPad if they do that.

364
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And I kind of think that's going to be where their niche could be.

365
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Is that the Sony NGP could kind of be like cheaper than an iPad but does a lot of the same stuff.

366
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
At least as far as games are concerned.

367
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So we'll see.

368
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Rama Narachan says, can someone tell me what NGP stands for?

369
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Next generation portable.

370
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It is a working name like Natal was. Do not expect that to be the final name.

371
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I would be very surprised if they really, I actually don't really care for that as a name.

372
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Because, and somebody in the chat had said it earlier, by the time the NGP releases it's going to be the CGP.

373
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The current generation portable.

374
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So it would be a little silly for them to actually call it that.

375
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Remember the Neptune.

376
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's right, huh?

377
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
The Dolphin was the Nintendo GameCube at one point.

378
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Or the Revolution was the Wii.

379
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So these code names, nothing new.

380
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm very curious to see what they're going to name it.

381
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I kind of don't think they would do PSP2.

382
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It doesn't roll off the tongue as nicely as PSP.

383
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You know what I mean?

384
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I know that sounds really like nitpicky, but there's just something about, it's like all the extra syllables or something.

385
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I know I'm being weird, but I just don't see PSP2 being it either.

386
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't know. We'll see.

387
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Let's talk a little more about what's going on with the new Sony system and it's this feature.

388
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And I kind of like this, because I like to see what the systems are doing besides just remakes of the same old games now on a portable.

389
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I like to know where are they going to be taking the games.

390
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So I was very interested with this. Something called Live Area.

391
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You might have seen some of the little promos, some of the arts.

392
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
This very bubbly sort of interface.

393
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
All these little bubbles. I don't know if they're taking a cue from Nintendo and making things a little bit cuter or whatever.

394
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But one of the things in this interface is Live Area.

395
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's a game-oriented communication platform.

396
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It's the name for the user interface that's built into the system.

397
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
That's what there will be instead of a cross-media bar.

398
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And you're going to be able to get into the store, get into trophies, your friends list, a browser, and all this other stuff in there.

399
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Every game is going to have Live Area presence as well.

400
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Meaning that news can be fed right into the game and even other players that you're playing against.

401
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Also, very interesting, there's going to be a Near Future.

402
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It will track your location over time, create a map of where you've been, and I guess find other people that are playing games near you, physically.

403
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So, could be interesting, could be scary.

404
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You know, when I was first hearing about this, I don't know why, but something popped into my mind.

405
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,000
If they ever wanted to make Foursquare like an actual game, this might be the way to do it.

406
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You know what I mean?

407
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yeah, that could...

408
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't know. I mean, I don't know what the game is there.

409
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Sounds so handy for stalkers.

410
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yeah, so the privacy things on this are going to have to be very, you know, whatever.

411
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's kind of interesting, some of the cute things they do with GPS sometimes in games.

412
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:07,000
For example, earlier I was talking about my trip to Disneyland and one of the things that you could do is that there's actually a Disney game for Toy Story Midway Mania that you can buy on the iPhone.

413
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Well, if you happen to be in front of the ride and you launch the game, you get like a bonus feature that will unlock like, I don't know what it is, like a new background or a new gun or a new stage.

414
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Something special that you can only get when the GPS knows you are at the damn ride at Disneyland or Disney World because they have it too.

415
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So, it will be interesting to see kind of what the GPS technology kind of brings to games.

416
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Very curious.

417
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And people, you know what?

418
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
That Pokémon thing with the walking trainer and all that was really popular.

419
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So, it's not outside the realm of possibility that people kind of like these ideas of being rewarded for going places.

420
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
3DS is doing something similar too with the whole coins thing, built-in pedometer.

421
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So, it will be interesting.

422
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

423
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Well, news for our UK listeners.

424
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The 3DS eShop is actually not going to, well, is not going to go live like they said it would with launch.

425
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
They actually said that it's going to go live in May.

426
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Now, Nintendo UK said that it was going to be there with the launch, but Iwata basically said, nope, nope, nope.

427
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
The first system update is scheduled for late May, the same time around the world.

428
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So, it's not just them. It's everybody.

429
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I wish I'm glad Iwata came out and actually said something himself.

430
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But, you know, they need to make sure that all of their reps are on the same page.

431
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Don't you think?

432
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Yeah, it kind of makes it sound like they don't even know when the damn thing is launching.

433
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Kind of like, it'll be done when it's done.

434
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's going to be out in Europe on March 25th, but we won't have the eShop until the first system update.

435
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's just going to be in May.

436
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Does it seem now that maybe they're rushing the 3DS a little bit?

437
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Like, maybe they should have just waited to release it until summertime.

438
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I mean, maybe there's something about May, like why you have to release it in that type of timeframe or something like that.

439
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But, I'm sorry, March? I don't know why they couldn't have delayed this a little bit if it's not really ready.

440
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I mean, they're going to sell most of these at Christmas time anyway, right?

441
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
That would be reasonable to me.

442
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I don't know.

443
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And I also say that because of the launch games.

444
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You know, it kind of doesn't have the must-have title that's going to be out at launch.

445
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I mean, probably the coolest stuff that's coming out of launch is what? The Street Fighter game?

446
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The Dead or Alive game, maybe?

447
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And maybe Nintendogs and Cats, if that's what you're into.

448
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You know, but that's kind of a stretch for like a must-have launch title.

449
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You know, that Kid Icarus game didn't make it.

450
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You know, we haven't heard of the Zelda remake or any of that.

451
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You know, none of that kind of made the launch.

452
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So, I don't know.

453
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
What do you guys in our chat room think? chat.orangesoundsready.com

454
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Well, I was going to say actually it does seem like that they're like,

455
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Well, either we wait and put everything out together or we at least get the system out,

456
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
get some early sales going on.

457
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And then once everyone sees what else is on the eShop, then we get another boost in sales come May.

458
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
That's sort of what I'm seeing of.

459
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Go to our chat room at chat.orangesoundsready.com.

460
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
We're reading some comments from some of these other things we've been talking about.

461
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yizam says, The Pokewalker was awesome. Walk up to your fellow trainer and ask if they'd like to touch balls.

462
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I saw a lot of that happening at PAX East last year when I went.

463
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Spassinator says, I'm a bit paranoid about taking portable stuff out and about,

464
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
if only because I live in a rough neighborhood and I don't want to be jumped and robbed.

465
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It's actually not a bad point.

466
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Not everybody's going to want to find the players near them. You know what I mean?

467
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That could be a little scary.

468
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this name incorrectly.

469
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Niparos says, It does seem Netflix has Ren and Stimpy.

470
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Since we were wondering that earlier. Thanks for checking. Appreciate that.

471
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Good to know.

472
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Well, you know, the other thing too is that something like that actually might work in Japan.

473
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Because you remember with all the stuff that was happening with Monster Hunter.

474
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You know, that was such a big thing and people would just randomly challenge it.

475
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It was a Nintendogs thing. That's something that I think would happen more often in Japan.

476
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
But not so much here.

477
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Years ago, the barcode scanner.

478
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:42,000
You just got people that are more into it who will go to the cons and just walk through the street.

479
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh god, I forgot about that game.

480
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
There was some type of battle game that was battle barcodes or something.

481
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I remember that.

482
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And they sold out of this one brand of ramen or something.

483
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Because it created some uber monster.

484
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And then there was the CD one.

485
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
What was the game that you put in your CD and you get a different monster based on the CD?

486
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And you got this great monster by using Madonna?

487
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Totally don't know.

488
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
But now it would be too easy to just burn your own CD.

489
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Because obviously it was measuring track length and number of tracks or something. Interesting.

490
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Alright, let's go to the next story then.

491
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
We'll chew on this 3DS news a little bit.

492
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
See what happens closer to launch.

493
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And now back to more Sony news.

494
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
We talked about last week how the people figured out ways to load custom firmwares and stuff like that on their PS3.

495
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So what's the first thing that happens when they do that?

496
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Of course, release new PS3 firmware update or this could even go for the PSP.

497
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And patch all that stuff out.

498
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Or at least try to break it.

499
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So that's what they did.

500
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
They released 3.56 firmware.

501
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It adds no functionality whatsoever other than a security patch.

502
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And it basically changed some of the keys on different things.

503
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Kind of set everyone back a little bit in the hacking community because they don't have a way to modify the firmware yet.

504
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Another thing it did is it banned people from playing black ops that were cheating.

505
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Or were using modified game saves and other methods to cheat the game.

506
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And they've permanently banned those people from playing black ops in multiplayer.

507
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yay! Cheaters get smacked down.

508
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You just think about that future cheaters.

509
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's one thing if you want to cheat amongst people you know.

510
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't care if you cheat in single player where you're not going online or any of that.

511
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Or if you cheat with friends.

512
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But going just to be power tripping in random online matches is a dick thing to do.

513
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Dicks deserve to have dick things happen to them in return.

514
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And you remember how they were saying,

515
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Oh well there's no way for us to possibly stop these guys from cheating on our games.

516
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
There's no way. Oh poor us Activision.

517
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah I do remember that. That was funny.

518
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Weren't they trying to use that as an excuse or something?

519
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Well now that excuse is out of the way and hopefully they're going to fix everything.

520
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I do believe there was a patch for the PS3 version as well to fix some stuff.

521
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But now it's not an excuse.

522
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Alright. Let me move on to what's coming in a future PS3 update if the rumors are to be believed.

523
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And I would believe this actually.

524
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Apparently there are some folks in the development community that are getting notices from Sony saying that in firmware 3.60

525
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
cloud storage for saved games will be available.

526
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's called online saving. They're not calling it cloud saving.

527
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Maybe make everybody think of Final Fantasy 7. I don't know.

528
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But they're calling it online saving.

529
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
This means that you could actually save files on a remote server.

530
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So that way if I'm playing a game at home I could save to the online save and then access this at my friend's house.

531
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
That would be kind of cool.

532
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
There you go.

533
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
By the way this feature will only be available of course to PlayStation Plus subscribers.

534
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Ha ha ha.

535
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So there you go.

536
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And this doesn't surprise me at all.

537
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I seem to remember when they first announced the PlayStation Plus that this was one of the features they were touting.

538
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So it's not too surprising that this is finally coming out.

539
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Kind of a neat idea.

540
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You know I kind of like that idea.

541
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And if you go to your friend's houses and sometimes forget your save files.

542
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Or hauling the memory cards around is too big of a bitch or whatever.

543
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You know or you forget then it's a neat idea.

544
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I kind of wish Microsoft had one too that didn't involve save cards.

545
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So I think it's neat.

546
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I don't know is this a feature you'd use?

547
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I don't think anyone in here uses PlayStation Plus right now.

548
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Is this something that might make you want to get it?

549
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Nope.

550
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
No? Why not?

551
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Because I don't ever take my game saves anywhere other than you know on my PS3.

552
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And if I really was you know aching to do that I could just throw it on a jump drive.

553
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Dark Sakura? Anything that would interest you?

554
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's a neat idea.

555
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It's a fun concept but I don't I'd have to see it more in practice before I make a judgment on it.

556
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Honestly.

557
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
This would have been perfect in like the college dorm where everybody had a video game system.

558
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And you're going from like room to room.

559
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
That would have been great.

560
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You know it would have been something like that would have been cool back in the the DVR edit days.

561
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You know.

562
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Let's see.

563
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.

564
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Tigerclaw says so Sky is saying I don't care if you're autistic you're still a cheater.

565
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Oh boy.

566
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
He's invoking a story which didn't make our show world tonight.

567
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Maybe you've heard of it.

568
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,000
But Microsoft banned this kid and the mom was all over the media saying he's autistic and he's just really good at games.

569
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And Microsoft's like no we caught him cheating.

570
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
He's banned from the network just like anybody else would be.

571
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And turns out it came to light.

572
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yes he was doing that whole save file exploit thing where he could unlock achievements from opening up a save file.

573
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And so yeah.

574
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I don't care if you're autistic.

575
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
If you cheat you're a cheater and you should be dealt with appropriately.

576
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I agree.

577
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
That has nothing to do with the end result.

578
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Totally agree.

579
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It doesn't matter the color of your skin, the sexuality, any type of handicap you might have.

580
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Physical, mental.

581
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Cheating is cheating.

582
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Period.

583
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
You know what I mean.

584
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's just a little silly.

585
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I like how, and this is all I'm going to say on it.

586
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I like how when you know someone with a disability or you know some persecuted group will just come right out and say oh well you're doing it because of this this and this.

587
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
No you wanted to be treated like everybody else right?

588
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
How far do I want to go with this? How controversial do I want to be on the show?

589
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
There's a difference between actually singling somebody out and then treating somebody like everybody else.

590
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Alright. Do you guys remember there was that burger joint in Town Town that was very popular.

591
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It was all over the Food Network shows.

592
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And they ended up getting sued by the American Disability Association or whatever because apparently the place was called the Squeeze In.

593
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And it kind of made its whole little reputation off of being packed and crowded all of the time.

594
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And some folks sued them based on disability needs and the damn place almost closed.

595
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
That's ridiculous.

596
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And I kind of, I agree. And here's the thing.

597
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Well technically it did close.

598
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It did close and it had to reopen in a new location.

599
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:54,000
But they, and this is important to say, all you had to do was to honk your horn outside the restaurant and they would have served you whatever.

600
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I mean they, you did not have to actually go into the restaurant.

601
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So I don't think anyone was like totally being discriminated against or what have you.

602
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
You know? It just kind of struck me as, you know, ruining it for everyone. I don't know.

603
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
No, I agree.

604
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It was a mess. But at the same time, that place never got more publicity than when that whole thing happened.

605
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You know what I mean?

606
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So, I don't care.

607
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Alright. Let's see. Moving on to the chat room.

608
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Spaznator in our chat room says, disability is no excuse to cheat.

609
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm disabled myself and I refuse to cheat.

610
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
If I can do it just as good, if not better, at a game, I wear that fact as a badge of friggin' honor.

611
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I agree. It's a good one.

612
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I gotta read this comment from Derek H. Maybe lighten the mood a little bit too.

613
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
At our chatroom at chat.orangemantraded.com, Derek H says, confirmed.

614
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Rob says, it's okay to cheat with friends.

615
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I think a lot of bored housewives share the same philosophy.

616
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So are you saying that the mailman is a friend?

617
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I'm not sure quite what you're saying there.

618
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Alright.

619
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Well if you're fucking him, he is.

620
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think you know what I meant.

621
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It's okay if you're a bored housewife cheating in...

622
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
What would bored housewives play? Final Fantasy XI?

623
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Bunko.

624
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Bunko. If you're all cheating in Bunko, you have...

625
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Do they even have Bunko on Xbox Live Arcade or anything like that?

626
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
No.

627
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
That's a whole niche market they're missing out on.

628
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
If you have house rules for Bunko, then that's fine.

629
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You know what I would actually compare it to?

630
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And this is totally not what Derek meant by his comment, but too late.

631
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
You know in Monopoly, a lot of people say that every time you pay fines,

632
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
you're supposed to put it in the center of the board,

633
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
and if you land on free parking, you get the jackpot?

634
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
That's a house rule.

635
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
That's a house rule. That's not a rule. That's cheating.

636
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
You're cheating.

637
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But you agree to house rules because it's kind of how you play with friends, right?

638
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So, anyhow.

639
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Let's move on.

640
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
More stories, Loki.

641
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Okay, so this is kind of more about the whole firmware updates and whatnot.

642
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It ties in to all that.

643
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Sony, of course, was granted a temporary restraining order against GeoHot.

644
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Basically preventing him from offering to the public, creating, posting online,

645
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
marketing, advertising, promoting, installing, distributing, providing,

646
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
or otherwise trafficking in any software or methods for circumventing PS3 protection methods.

647
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
No longer can he provide links from any websites to any other websites relating to such matters

648
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
or publish any information obtained by hacking the PS3,

649
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and more to the point, he can no longer engage in acts of circumvention of the TPMS

650
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,000
in the PS3 system to access, obtain, remove, or traffic in copyrighted works.

651
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Which I don't think he was doing anyways.

652
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And then, of course, there's still issues about the whole jurisdiction issues

653
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
since, of course, he resides in a different state than Sony

654
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
and a different state from where the claim was filed.

655
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And they're saying that because he purposefully directed his activities at the forum state of California,

656
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
they're letting it go through.

657
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
So that's kind of, that's not a good precedent to be setting by the courts,

658
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,000
saying, oh, well, because you conducted yourself on a website that was located in California,

659
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
we can try you in California.

660
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,000
So, you know, anybody who uses Facebook or Twitter or whatever can be tried in California,

661
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
no matter where you are in the world, I guess.

662
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I find this comment from our chatroom interesting.

663
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I have to ask Loki about it here.

664
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It's from Napreos.

665
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I finally figured out how to pronounce the name.

666
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Napreos says, F-G-O-HOT.

667
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
He deserves it, cocky bastard.

668
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Now, I haven't really seen this guy in action.

669
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I realize he's been in the media and so forth, but is that, like, a legitimate claim?

670
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Is he really cocky?

671
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Like, did he kind of have it coming to him?

672
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't know if he's cocky, but it all comes down to, I mean, this is just part of the discovery phase of the whole trial.

673
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It's not like Sony is getting his equipment.

674
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I mean, they'll have access to it along with the lawyers, you know, to kind of make sure no funny business is going on,

675
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
but it's not like this stuff gets shipped to Sony.

676
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And even still, it doesn't even really matter.

677
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Like I said, this whole trial isn't necessarily about, you know, what GeoHot's doing, because there's plenty of other people.

678
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I mean, all he did was post the keys.

679
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
He didn't create the custom firmwares that are out there.

680
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
He didn't, you know, create the abilities to play backup games.

681
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That was other people.

682
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And they've actually gone and they've been doing cease and desists on different websites, hosting files and whatnot,

683
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,000
but now people have kind of diverted that stuff to a file hosting place off-sea, you know, in other countries.

684
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So they can't be touched, I guess.

685
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Let me play devil's advocate here for a minute.

686
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Not that I necessarily feel this way, but wouldn't that sort of be the equivalent of you shut down a file sharing site such as Pirate Bay or whatever,

687
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
because they're enabling people to facilitate illegal downloads.

688
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
They're not posting the illegal downloads themselves, but because they facilitate it, they're the ones that get in trouble.

689
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I would say that would make sense if you're basically... if he was releasing the backup creator for it.

690
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yes, this could be used for legitimate backups, but some people might not use it for that.

691
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
That's not what he's doing at all.

692
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:49,000
This is basically saying, I guess it would be the equivalent of a car salesman handing you the keys to a car and you go hit someone with that car.

693
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
They're enabling you to get in that car and murder someone with that car, so they should be held liable for it.

694
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
That's basically what the equivalent of it is.

695
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Dealerships actually do have liability against that type of thing.

696
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,000
But it's retarded. I understand that they may get away with that in the laws in the United States because it's absolutely retarded,

697
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
but people can sue and win for hot coffee.

698
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Granted, he posted stuff, keys, and I'm sure that they don't want people obviously giving them backdoor access to the entire PS3,

699
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:32,000
but what he's done, yes, may eventually lead to piracy or easier piracy on PlayStation 3,

700
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:41,000
because these tools allow people to run unsigned code and people can create unsigned programs for piracy purposes,

701
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
but also they can create code for other things.

702
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So it's not necessarily that he's directly responsible for it, but yes, he plays a part of that, I guess.

703
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
But once again, this court case isn't about necessarily him hacking stuff.

704
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
It's about whether you own that console that you purchased.

705
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I was going to say, and this is a great comment from Bob Coffey in our chat room here,

706
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Hackers aren't cheaters. The trial isn't about hacking. The trial is about your rights as a consumer,

707
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
not about CFW or any shit at that. The real precedent this may set is,

708
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
do you own the computing product you buy, or is it a licensed product?

709
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Interesting note to end it on. I guess we'll see what develops with this.

710
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Any rumors about, or any rumbling about any pushback, appeals, things of that nature? What happens next?

711
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Well, they've already filed an appeal to have the whole case, you know, dismissed,

712
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
but I don't think, it doesn't sound like that the judge is going for that.

713
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:46,000
So at this point, I don't know, it's going to be tough to prove that he did all this stuff, or he's actually doing it.

714
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The problem is that somebody's claiming all these things that obviously aren't true.

715
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Like they're saying, oh yes, he's pirating stuff, or he's enabled it for people to pirate stuff.

716
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
When they initially made that statement, that was not the case.

717
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Now it may be the case, because now there's the ability to do that, but it wasn't anything he did.

718
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So, I don't know, it's difficult to, it all depends on how intelligent the court, the judges and stuff like that,

719
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
and whether she's going to buy into this retarded nonsense.

720
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Alright, well we will see what develops. I'm sure we have not said the last on this,

721
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:33,000
so let's go ahead and move on to some release dates, and travel the world and see what is coming out in a video game store near you this week.

722
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Not a whole lot this week actually, it's pretty sad, but there will be some better stuff in the upcoming month.

723
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
This week, they've got a track pack for Rock Band.

724
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:55,000
If you're missing out on some country music, there's a second country track pack coming out this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

725
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Let's see, some other smaller games, Junior Brain Trainer 2 is making its way out on DS.

726
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:14,000
The Sims 3 Outdoor Living, it's kind of an expansion pack for The Sims 3, that's coming out on PC.

727
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
That's funny. On PC they have a game called The Ball.

728
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Apparently someone took my advice and made a game about ball.

729
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Wow!

730
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
That is coming out on PC.

731
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And then of course, a week from today, sort of, Mario Sports Mix will be out on the Wii.

732
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
That's it?

733
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Yeah.

734
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Wow.

735
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
It's a really, really dead week.

736
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Is there a reason for that? Is that just because of the 3DS?

737
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Not yet into the middle of February. February is a pretty light month.

738
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I mean, it's more games than there would be in January, but it's not March.

739
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Alright. Well, let's move on and look at Japan and what they've got coming out.

740
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I gotta tell you, it's kind of the same thing. They don't have a whole lot coming out.

741
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
There's a couple things to note. Dodonpachi Daifukutsu Black Label comes out.

742
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
That's a cave shooter coming out on the Xbox 360.

743
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:25,000
That is coming out on February the 3rd because they get a lot of those shooters over there where it's just pretty much that little center of the screen getting taken up with a shooter.

744
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
But quite an audience for the shmups over here too.

745
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So you can check that out.

746
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Also, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 gets its localized edition on the Xbox 360 this week.

747
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
That is also coming out on the PlayStation 3 and that's the only PS3 release this week in Japan.

748
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Going to the Nintendo Wii real quick.

749
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Nothing.

750
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Things are dying down on the Nintendo front, of course, because of the 3DS's impending release on February 26th over there.

751
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Although the Nintendo DS does have a couple things to note.

752
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Dragon Ball Ultimate Butou 2 Den comes out this week from Namco Bandai.

753
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Also, Gyakuten Kenji 2 comes out this week.

754
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
That is in a regular and a limited edition. It's coming out from Capcom.

755
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I believe that is a Phoenix Wright spinoff game.

756
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
That comes out this week.

757
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
It definitely has some of the same characters in that series.

758
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I think this looks to be a little more like walking around adventure-y type of game, but I'm sure still the whole courtroom scenes and objections that you know and love.

759
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Moving on quickly to the PSP.

760
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
There's a release on there that some folks might be interested in.

761
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
White Knight Chronicles Episode Portable Dogma Wars comes out this week.

762
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
That's an official Sony product from Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan this week.

763
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
It'll be interesting to see what they improved on in the PS3 version, if anything.

764
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Also on the PSP, Macross Triangle Frontier.

765
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And that does it for your Japanese releases.

766
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Wait, that's the Macross Frontier game?

767
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Yeah, Macross Triangle Frontier.

768
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Let me see, because Macross Frontier is the...

769
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Yeah, that's for the new one that came out.

770
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
The new series it was out.

771
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Which Dan and I watched all the way through. It's really good.

772
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
So this looks really cool.

773
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Looks kind of like a 3D shooter game.

774
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Not like a typical shmup. More of like a polygon-y shmup game.

775
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:21,000
We're big fans of the Macross games. I bet it's a lot like the VFR games.

776
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Actually, we've got Macross M3 for Dreamcast, which is a really good game.

777
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
So yeah, I love the Macross games.

778
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Was that Japan?

779
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
That's it for Japan.

780
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:43,000
In the UK, February 2nd, we have Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

781
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
We have long cookies.

782
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
On the 4th, we have Earthrise, Lord of Arcana.

783
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Mario vs. Donkey Kong Mini Land Mayhem. Nailed.

784
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Sega Mega Drive Classics Volume 4 and Two Worlds 2.

785
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
That's it.

786
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Let's move on with some more stories.

787
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And the Classic Game of the Week is just ahead.

788
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I don't know what's more ridiculous.

789
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
The whole lawsuit that this company is facing or the name of this game.

790
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
But Facebook game Blingville is getting the cease and desist from Zynga.

791
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Apparently Zynga believes that they own the rights to the use of Ville in any product.

792
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I guess it's out there.

793
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Gosh, what are you, the new monster cables? Seriously.

794
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I'm going to start suing everybody for using Ville or Doodle or Monster.

795
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
But apparently, they have a...

796
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Send a cease and desist to Blingville LLC.

797
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
A unique company name, I suppose.

798
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The creators of the Facebook game, of course, has the same name.

799
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:01,000
According to Zynga, the use of Ville in the game and the company's moniker infringes on its own collection of social gaming trademarks.

800
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Blingville, of course, associated with Zynga in any way, has filed a letter to the West Virginia US District Court seeking a declaration from the court that the game does not actually infringe on Zynga's trademarks.

801
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,000
The studio also hopes to have Zynga foot the bill for any legal fees potentially accrued during the legal battle.

802
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And I guess right now, it's just a matter of time to see what happens.

803
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I love Breslull's comment in our chat room. Cruella de Vil? Will they be suing Disney?

804
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I think that's possible.

805
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Come on, Zynga.

806
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I kind of find it to be a taste of their own medicine a little bit. Wasn't Farmville like a rip-off of Farm Town? Which of those two came first?

807
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It was Farm Town.

808
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Ah, so, I mean, come on, Zynga.

809
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Whatever. Zynga's, like, evil, okay? And that's all it comes down to.

810
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
People hate Zynga. Like, they don't have any original content. It's just ripped off from stuff.

811
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And now they're suing people out of the way because they may come in and start taking away some of the money that Farmville or Cityville or, I don't know, whatever.

812
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Just because you have names of stuff that end with a Ville does not mean all of a sudden you own the trademark to Ville.

813
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
They're gonna sue Danville next.

814
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I think the people that made Farm Town should sue them because they started farm games, honestly.

815
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
If that lawsuit didn't already happen.

816
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Yeah, I'm looking at Wikipedia. I mean, I know it's not a definitive resource, but it's a pretty good place to start researching.

817
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And I do notice it says Farmville started as a clone of the popular Farm Town, which also featured on Facebook in June 2009.

818
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And there are some citations for that.

819
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
What's the other big Zynga game? Isn't Yeoville another big one? Do they even have that?

820
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I don't know. Let me see. I thought that's what it was called. I don't see an article on that.

821
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
What are the other big Zynga games out there? I wanna know if they were not those two.

822
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Texas Hold'em.

823
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Really?

824
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Dan plays that.

825
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Ugh. Um. Let's see. I'm trying to see if they have like a list of games somewhere here. Oh, here we go.

826
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Mafia Wars. Wasn't that a knockoff of a game, too?

827
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I know this is a very exciting radio. Yeah.

828
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:24,000
The makers of a similar online game, Mob Wars, sued Zynga over the launch of Mafia Wars, accusing them of copyright infringement.

829
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Frontierville. That's the other big one, too.

830
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
That's the one I always see on my stupid wall. I don't think that was necessarily a ripoff of anything, though.

831
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Interesting.

832
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Alright.

833
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I just think all of thoseville games are a waste of time.

834
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You know, I would sit here and criticize it, but then, again, I can't stop playing that stupid Knights of the Clicky.

835
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Or, what is it really called? Knights of the Crystal is the real name of the game.

836
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
That Square Enix one. Can't stop playing it. It's the dumbest game ever, but I just keep clickin'.

837
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Click, click, click. Keep doing quests. The artwork's really good, at least. I can say that. Get away with that.

838
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Alright, here's a more respectable game I'm getting excited about. Portal 2. Of course, Portal 2 is coming out soon.

839
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I guess that's really a relative term, but it's coming out within the next few months.

840
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Portal 2 is going to be coming out, of course, on the PC and the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

841
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,000
But we had some news, of course, last week about how PlayStation 3 is supposed to be the definitive version.

842
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Well, there's going to be a lot of cool stuff on the PC version as well, including mod tools.

843
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
You know, what is a Valve game that doesn't have some mod tools available for it?

844
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And some mod tools will be available on the PC version of Portal 2.

845
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Unfortunately, that content is not going to be available on the 360 or the PS3, meaning the mod tools.

846
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,000
However, what they're saying, and this is a quote from Chet Felizic, who is from Valve, saying,

847
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
The content that comes out is agnostic, and so we will be seeing that on all platforms.

848
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Depending on the platform you're on, I should say, will depend on how we're delivering it.

849
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Meaning that, you know, the content that you make, it could come out on the PS3 or it could come out on the 360.

850
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Perhaps it's some type of download content, maybe a best of on the PC.

851
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:13,000
But if you are really into the user content, then maybe you ought to think about that when you decide which system you're going to purchase the game on.

852
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:23,000
By the way, they are also saying that each of the game's two campaign modes will have individual surprise rewards when you beat them.

853
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So single player has one reward, co-op has another.

854
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
There are two sets of credits and two sets of endings. Interesting.

855
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So if you really want to get the full game, you're going to have to play single and you're going to have to play co-op.

856
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
That should be very interesting.

857
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:47,000
So there you go, Portal 2 coming out whenever Valve's ready. I know there's a release date out there somewhere, but I refuse to believe anything final until the game is actually out on shelves.

858
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
If you need something to play in the meantime, how about the classic game of the week?

859
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:59,000
It's a chance for DarkSakura to dive into the gaming vault and pick a game that she thinks, hey, you kids ought to be playing this.

860
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
This is a true classic game.

861
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And instead of all this newfangled Farmville crap, and I mean crap...

862
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Get off my lawn.

863
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Go play this game instead and get off my lawn.

864
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Alright, what is the classic game of the week?

865
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Pull up your pants.

866
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
What is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?

867
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I think that the chat room will be able to tell the moment the music plays.

868
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Well then, let me pull up the little music here and...

869
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And whoever guesses first in the chat room, I'm looking, gets a no prize.

870
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Alright, I'm looking at you, chat room.

871
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
They're on to like a minute delay, so you might want to see it for a little bit.

872
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Okay. Well, it is Final Fantasy VI, or as we got it over here, Final Fantasy III.

873
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And it is one of my all-time favorite games because of this music.

874
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
This music is epic. It makes me want to climb a mountain.

875
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It had a great, great, great story.

876
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:06,000
It had really amazing classic scenes, like the Opera House, which of course everyone knows.

877
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:14,000
This whole music plays when they're in their little machine walker things.

878
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
And Bojikawa gets the no prize, by the way.

879
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It was just amazing.

880
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:30,000
This game came out in 1994 in Japan, and then it came out in 1999 on the PlayStation.

881
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
It was amazing, like I've said a bunch of times.

882
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:41,000
It's actually sort of based about the second industrial revolution,

883
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
meaning that it's got the sort of technical aspects into the game.

884
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Character designs were done by Yoshitaka Amano,

885
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:57,000
and he did pretty much everything with that game as far as the character designs and whatnot.

886
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Well, actually also he and Yoshinori Kitase,

887
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:11,000
and then of course the composer for the music was Nobuo Uematsu, so it was really good.

888
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It had random encounters, and you had chocobos in your airship,

889
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
and it was just everything that one expects to be in a Final Fantasy game.

890
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
You had an active time battle system, you had four players per party,

891
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
and you could also change your main person walking around, I think by hitting one of the shoulder buttons.

892
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,000
You had your thief, you had the runic ability, which was absorbing magic attacks until the next turn.

893
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That was Selle's.

894
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
All kinds of different stuff.

895
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Then you had your special hidden characters like Gao, who was the monster mimic.

896
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And you had a Moogle, who...

897
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Why can't I remember the Moogle's name?

898
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Anyway, Mog, yes, thank you, it was Mog.

899
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Because Mog house.

900
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
But anyway, he had dances, which was always really fun.

901
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Dude, it was all about Realm, who had the drawing attack.

902
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
That was really sick.

903
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So yeah, it had all kinds of neat stuff.

904
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
It's very steampunky in ways too, combining technology and magic.

905
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And it had the most insane bad guy ever, Kefka, who just had this funny, funny laugh.

906
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And...

907
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I know, right?

908
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Oh, and don't forget, the man.

909
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
If you can find the music rub, you should play it. Shadow.

910
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
If I can find it.

911
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Because he was freaking amazing.

912
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:52,000
But yeah, it actually had alterations made in some of the character sprites.

913
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:01,000
For example, there was this one character who you could see her naked butt, and they covered her butt up.

914
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:08,000
You know, some of the item names were changed here and there, especially for the PlayStation release.

915
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Yo, you found it.

916
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
This is also the good music of the game.

917
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Turn it up a little bit wrong.

918
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
What did you say?

919
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Dan said he would slit his mama's throat for...

920
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I know, but I forgot the line.

921
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Wasn't Shadow, like, wasn't the whole thing that Shadow's a chick?

922
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
No.

923
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I thought, isn't Shadow supposed to be, like, Realm's mom or something?

924
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Realm's father. Oh, okay.

925
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Hinted app, but never confirmed.

926
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Dan's talking off mic.

927
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
That'll be confirmed in Final Fantasy VI, too.

928
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
When Square gets around to making that.

929
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:59,000
But, I mean, and keep in mind, you know, they used the characters from this for doing the Nintendo 64 demo, remember?

930
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
When they were gonna put Final Fantasy VII on the Nintendo 64.

931
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Which the demo is kinda weird looking, but it was neat at the same time.

932
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
But this was seriously...

933
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I think it has to be one of the highlights of the series.

934
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Definitely one of the highlights of the series.

935
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:21,000
And there's also discussion about it being remade for the 3DS. I think that's pretty cool.

936
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
That'd be neat.

937
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Yeah.

938
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
But, yeah. There we go.

939
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
There it is, folks. Your classic game of the week, Final Fantasy VI.

940
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Or as you might call it, it's so good it's Final Fantasy sex.

941
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I don't know. It's up to you.

942
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Alright, that's gonna do it for Part A tonight of Orange Lounge Radio.

943
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
But don't go anywhere, guys. We're not done with the show yet.

944
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Part B is coming up. We have more news for you guys.

945
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
We're gonna talk about an interesting funding program for independent video games.

946
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
We'll get into that.

947
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Some clarity on the next wave of 3DS games, including Kid Icarus and some other things.

948
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Some developments in that whole Sarian.net thing.

949
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Remember how you could play like King's Quest on your iPad?

950
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
We have some updates on that.

951
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
We're gonna get into all that in Part B as well as your Twitter topics.

952
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So get them in at OLR on Twitter.

953
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Your emails and much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

954
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

955
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:25,000
We are live on this Sunday, January the 30th of 2011 for the 399th episode of our show.

956
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
That's right. We hit a little bit of a milestone next week.

957
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
And then I get to start saying four a lot.

958
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
No plans of ending anytime soon.

959
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:38,000
We'll still be here until, I don't know, one of us is hospitalized for a long time or something.

960
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I shouldn't say something like that. God, I hope nothing like that ever happens.

961
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Anyhow, meanwhile, we also have side projects.

962
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Like this thing's been going on so long that now everybody wants to do their side project.

963
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Not everyone.

964
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Not everyone. Well, Loki, your baby is your side project. That's kind of...

965
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
18 years worth of side projects.

966
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Even if it wasn't.

967
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:03,000
That's right. Josh, the... I don't know. I would love to hear Nellie do a podcast about video games because she kind of hates them all.

968
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Well, she's like, I have to always stay here and watch the baby.

969
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I was like, well, you can go do the show. I'll stay here and watch the baby.

970
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I was like, okay.

971
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
That would be fun. I think on April Fool's Day, you should send Nellie over.

972
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
We'll make her read stories and everything.

973
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
She'll be like, I don't even know what this says. This is just words.

974
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
What is this? You guys, what is this?

975
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
You guys care about this stuff?

976
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
She's welcome to bring Josh over.

977
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
That's right, yeah.

978
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
And then I'll watch the baby and she can read my stories.

979
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
He's sick right now. He can't come over.

980
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
All right. Anyhow.

981
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Other things to talk about that's going on. Spinoff shows, sideshows.

982
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Dark Sakura does a comic book one every week. Tell us about it.

983
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It's called Comic Insanity.

984
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And we basically just talk about, you know, what's coming out this week, every Wednesday.

985
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
And the show goes up on Tuesday, ideally.

986
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And, you know, we talk about what we're reading, what we're looking forward to.

987
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
We all have a pick that all three of us are going to read.

988
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
And then we also review different things that we've read.

989
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Like, for example, we all just read, excuse me, IDW's Infestation.

990
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I think it was Infestation. Yeah.

991
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Which, you know, we all gave our reviews on it. I hated it.

992
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And, you know, talked about other comics that we read.

993
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Next week, if you want to hear our review on a comic called Witchfinder,

994
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
then we will be reviewing that one next week.

995
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
We also have an app for Android, so you can listen to episodes and tweet us.

996
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
We have our iPhone app coming soon.

997
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Want to know our app for Android? What the hey?

998
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I'm working on this.

999
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
All right. I want to know more about this.

1000
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
But I just found out about it.

1001
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Okay. That's fine.

1002
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So, yeah. And you can find us on Infamous.net and F-A-M-O-U-S.net.

1003
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Awesome.

1004
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Hoard House. The best little Hoard House in Azeroth if you want more Warcraft talk.

1005
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And how could you possibly want more after this show?

1006
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
No, there's a whole show I have with my pal Xtaphir that we talk about Warcraft.

1007
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Didn't have a show this week, so I can't tell you what was going on.

1008
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Xtaphir had an emergency he had to deal with, so we didn't have a show this week.

1009
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
But we are going to be back next week talking about, you know,

1010
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
what's going on in the world of Warcraft.

1011
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And there's a new patch on the horizon that's likely to drop this week,

1012
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
so I'm sure there's going to be a lot of talk about some of the changes they make this week.

1013
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
They already put up a patch, didn't they?

1014
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Well, they patch that game all the time.

1015
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Oh, no, because I upgraded to Cataclysm and that's when mine patched.

1016
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Got it. Yeah, that's the patch you're thinking of.

1017
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
But there is a new, it's the post-Cataclysm patch that fixes some of the problems.

1018
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
That fixed the arcane?

1019
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'd go that far.

1020
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
But we'll be talking about some of that next week on the show.

1021
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Also, Bresloul would slap me in the face if I did not mention what's going on with

1022
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
U.S.L. Madness.

1023
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Understation Live's little tournament that they do where they try to find the best

1024
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
video game of all time, time, time, time, time.

1025
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Vote now. All the links are in our forums at

1026
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
orangesloudestrader.com. Check the U.S.L. Madness forum.

1027
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Which we know what's going to win, and I know it's not on any of the lists,

1028
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
but it's going to be a write-in winner.

1029
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You watch Barbie Horse Adventures.

1030
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It's going to be a dark horse.

1031
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I'm not, literally, I'm not sure that there's a write-in thing you can do after

1032
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
the beginning, but if there's a way to hack it, Loki will.

1033
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Loki will hack the results of U.S.L. Madness. Just watch.

1034
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
They'll all be Barbie Horse Adventure.

1035
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
It'll all be Barbie Horse Adventure.

1036
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And then I have to say this. Bobby, the gentleman who does the show before us,

1037
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
the Bobby Black Wolf show, it's fantastic.

1038

1039
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
He mentioned on his show tonight, he was reviewing the game Two Worlds 2,

1040
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
and he talked for a long time about this game.

1041
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I haven't even touched the game yet.

1042
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
The first one was so bad, from what I heard, that I had no interest in the

1043
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
second one, but apparently the second one fixes a lot of problems.

1044
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
There's a lot of funny references in it, and one of the screenshots she sent us

1045
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
is a character saying, or you can choose between an option, saying,

1046
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I'll do it, and, well, I'm pleased to inform you that you can now ask

1047
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Mr. Mirage to die in a fire. That's right.

1048
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
The die in a fire reference has made it into a video game.

1049
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
There you go.

1050
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
If you said die in a boat fire, then we know that they were listening to OLR,

1051
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
because I don't think you hear that expression anywhere else.

1052
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
But if you have never heard die in a boat fire before, Dark Soccer's eating,

1053
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
so I'll have to explain it to you.

1054
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Oh, Dark Soccer's gonna chew, chew, chew.

1055
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Okay.

1056
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Okay, die in a boat fire.

1057
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Sorry, I'm eating unagi.

1058
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Why would you tell someone to die in a boat fire?

1059
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Because you'd either drown to death because you couldn't get back in the boat

1060
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,000
because it was on fire, or you would burn to death out of fear of drowning.

1061
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
There you go.

1062
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I think it should actually be an oil tanker fire.

1063
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Because then the water will be on fire, too.

1064
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
That's the worst kind of fire. It's like, how do I put it out?

1065
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
The water's on fire.

1066
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Exactly.

1067
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
It's just more fire.

1068
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Wow. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

1069
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
We gotta get to some rapid news, a lot of quick stories.

1070
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
We have a lot tonight between Logie and myself doing some quick news tonight.

1071
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Logie?

1072
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Yes, two great games from my childhood coming back on Facebook.

1073
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
You know, I think it's awesome.

1074
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Oregon Trail and Carmen Sandiego are coming back.

1075
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
They're making their return.

1076
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Of course, getting a little bit of a facelift as well.

1077
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I believe the Oregon Trail one is actually the one that's been on the phones for a while now.

1078
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Judging by the screenshots, it kind of resembles that.

1079
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate, but who cares?

1080
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
It's awesome. Carmen Sandiego and Oregon Trail.

1081
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Seriously, kids need to grow up on that.

1082
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:46,000
That should be required PC game playing as part of your curriculum in grade school.

1083
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And I hope to hell, I hope to hell this song is in it.

1084
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Because if they don't have this song in it, then seriously, fuck this game.

1085
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:05,000
What about an alternative rock edition of that song?

1086
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I might be okay with that. Like a death metal version of this.

1087
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Tell me where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.

1088
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Gwar, now doing the theme to where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.

1089
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Oh, she's in my pants.

1090
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
But yeah, that's going to be coming out very soon.

1091
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
February 2nd, the Oregon Trail will be coming.

1092
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
And then February 9th, very next week, Carmen Sandiego.

1093
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
So that's pretty awesome.

1094
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
So Rob, are you going to be playing these on Facebook?

1095
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I'll at least check them out at least once.

1096
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
You know you have to try at least the Carmen Sandiego one, so I can post to my wall.

1097
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Rob has found Carmen Sandiego. She was under the mattress the whole time.

1098
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Click here to find her.

1099
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:07,000
It's annoying because we had these giant posters in our computer lab with different country flags and stuff like that.

1100
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
You have to know geography and stuff like that. I don't know geography. I'm good at the Oregon Trail.

1101
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I can shoot animals. That's fine.

1102
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I was always super good at where in time was Carmen Sandiego because I am a big history nerd.

1103
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I have been since I was a little kid.

1104
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
You're just a big nerd, and you have been since you were a little kid.

1105
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Yeah, I am.

1106
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And that's why we love you.

1107
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I was going to say, the Oregon Trail, you know in this one, if it's not already out, in this one, you will be able to pick your friends,

1108
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:43,000
like literally from your friends list that will go on the Oregon Trail with you, so I can post to your wall like,

1109
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Hi, Jamie. You just, Jamie, insert real last name here, you just died of dysentery on Rob's Oregon Trail.

1110
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Click here to find the cure.

1111
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I'm so going to play that.

1112
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
It's called modern medicine.

1113
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Here, drink this. We don't know what's in it, but the snake oil lady said it would help.

1114
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Why can't we get like further expansions to the Oregon Trail like, you know, zombies.

1115
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Zombies have attacked your party.

1116
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Oregon Trail 2. Fuck it, we're going back.

1117
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Wagons East. Sorry, Chris Farley.

1118
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Or no, not Chris Farley, I'm sorry, that's even before Chris Farley.

1119
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
That's John Candy.

1120
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
That was Canadian Bacon was the other one, remember that?

1121
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Invading Canada.

1122
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Alright, anyhow.

1123
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
So the Japanese folks are getting their hands on Scribblenauts,

1124
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:46,000
and they're also getting their hands on a few additional characters and objects added in thanks to a translation from Konami.

1125
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:55,000
The Japanese version will feature some wonderful Konami staples, including Old Snake from Metal Gear Solid 4,

1126
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Gradis' Vic Viper, and Love Plus' Manaka Tanake.

1127
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
And where is Twinbee?

1128
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Where, may I ask, is Twinbee?

1129
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I don't know, well these are just the screenshots that were posted.

1130
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Maybe there are more things in there, maybe people haven't tried Twinbee.

1131
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Okay, alright, fair enough.

1132
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
DDR machine.

1133
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,000
That's kind of cool though, since a different company kind of works with it in another country,

1134
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
it gets some extra easter eggs, it's kind of cool.

1135
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:30,000
It's also rumored that if you type in failure, a version of Rock Revolution appears.

1136
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Miserable failure. Oh, it's a copy of Rock Revolution.

1137
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Thanks to a financial quarterly report from Nintendo, a new Kirby sequel is coming from the developer HAL,

1138
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:58,000
and they have a teaser actually for it, and apparently it looks like a 3D Kirby game, just not all yarny.

1139
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:04,000
So it is going to be a more traditional Kirby game, but still pretty cool looking.

1140
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Now with less yarn and more sucking.

1141
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Yes.

1142
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
But that's a good thing, when you're talking about Kirby.

1143
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Pokémon Black and White are actually getting some PC connectivity.

1144
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Apparently using, of course they also have the Pokéwalker peripheral, which was from Heart and Gold,

1145
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,000
but that won't be used in Black and White at all, but they're going to have the Pokémon Global Link.

1146
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It's a website launching this spring, I guess shortly after the game is released,

1147
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,000
which allows players to sync their save files to an online profile, giving them an access to a wide range of tools,

1148
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:51,000
including to network with fellow trainers, also check their battle statistics, assigning them worldwide rankings,

1149
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:57,000
and granting them eligibility to participate in live regional, national, and global tournaments.

1150
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And it says the site will host mini-games which let players collect Pokémon items,

1151
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
which they can transfer back to their cartridges as well,

1152
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:16,000
and also let them sync a monster from their games to the website and explore their dreams online.

1153
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Nerds.

1154
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Interesting.

1155
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And then, let's see, last but not least, Rock Band, of course having more stuff coming out this week.

1156
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
This week is actually going to be The Clash and their London Calling album.

1157
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,000
You can buy the whole album for $20, or you can buy each individual track for $2 each,

1158
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:43,000
or whatever in your preferred console's space bucks.

1159
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:51,000
It includes the tracks London Calling, Brand New Cadillac, Jimmy Jazz, Hateful, Rudy Can't Fail,

1160
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Spanish Bombs to the Right Profile, Lost in the Supermarket, Clamp Down, The Guns of Brixton,

1161
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Rong M. Boyo, Death and Glory, Coca-Cola, the card sheet, Lever's Rock, Four Horsemen,

1162
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I'm Not Down, and Revolution Rock.

1163
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:19,000
And of course, for what looks like London Calling, Rudy Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, Clamp Down,

1164
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:25,000
and the card sheet, they do have the Pro Guitar and Bass expansions available for an additional dollar

1165
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,000
if you're feeling like that.

1166
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,000
So, look forward to that this week.

1167
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Alright, moving on to some other stories, and we're going to start off with some news on Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1168
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:47,000
God, they have done such a good job keeping this game relevant, because they let a little bit of news out

1169
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
every week about some new characters that are in the game, so pretty cool.

1170
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Cienco and Sentinel have been confirmed as characters that will be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3,

1171
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
which is kind of funny, because I thought they had come out and said,

1172
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
no more Darkstalkers players, but yet it was a lie.

1173
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
So, yep, there it is.

1174
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
That'll be fun. I don't know.

1175
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Cienco's pretty cool. I remember I used Cienco all the time in Puzzle Fighter.

1176
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Or, she had a different name, I thought.

1177
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
No, in Puzzle Fighter.

1178
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Cienco's lay-light intercession was Mei Mei.

1179
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Ah, what about Sentinel? Are you excited about these characters coming to MVC 3, Dark Sakura?

1180
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Sentinel is badass. I just remember playing the Sentinel in the old X-Men Children of the Atom.

1181
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
We actually talked about that this morning.

1182
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
It came up in discussion on recording Comic Insanity.

1183
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Plug plug.

1184
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I think the consensus is that, yeah, cool characters.

1185
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I mean, there's still no Strider here, so what's up with that?

1186
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Alright, let's move on to some Sega Genesis stuff that's been added to Steam.

1187
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
If you didn't know, you can buy old Sega Genesis games available on Steam,

1188
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:00,000
and that way you can feel good about all those ROMs that you're playing that you're actually paying for them.

1189
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And, you know, it's all through Steam and all that good stuff.

1190
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
You can talk to people using the Steam interface and all that.

1191
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Alien Soldier, Landstalker, Light Crusader, Shining Force, Shining Force 2, Shining in the Darkness,

1192
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic and Knuckles, Streets of Rage, Streets of Rage 2,

1193
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Toejam and Earl, Toejam and Earl in Panic on Frunkatron, and Wonder Boy 3 Monster Lair.

1194
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
They are all there.

1195
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
You did say Gunstar Heroes, didn't you?

1196
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Yeah, Gunstar Heroes was also recently released, so I think that might be what is already there.

1197
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:34,000
But there is now a new collection that I think has some of that stuff, and new stuff as well.

1198
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I think those are all the sections with the old games.

1199
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Let me see, what is the new stuff here?

1200
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Ah, there we go.

1201
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Alien Soldier, Gunstar Heroes, Landstalker, Light Crusader, Shining Force, Shining Force 2,

1202
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Streets of Rage, Streets of Rage 2, Wonder Boy 3.

1203
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Lots of Genesis games. Go look at it on Steam.

1204
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
QuakeCon.

1205
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:06,000
If there's any fans of Quake in the house, QuakeCon 2011 is taking place August 4th through 7th this year.

1206
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
It's going to be in Dallas, Texas at the Hilton Anatole.

1207
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
So you could also bring in your PC and play some Quake there, LAN.

1208
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Have fun.

1209
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
It'll be interesting to see what they're going to announce at this.

1210
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I don't know if there's maybe going to be some stuff on Rage.

1211
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
That whole new...

1212
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Oh, I'm sure there will be.

1213
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Yeah, so take a look for that.

1214
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Also, there's a brand new iPad and iPhone app for Pac-Man Battle Royale.

1215
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Remember that? That's the arcade game that's coming out soon?

1216
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Well, there's actually like a little teaser or whatever you want to say that's available on the iPhone and the iPad.

1217
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
It's, I guess, like an actual first level of the game.

1218
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
That's kind of cool.

1219
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,000
So you can actually play that and then check it out in the arcades near you.

1220
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
It sucks that it's not a full game.

1221
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
It does kind of suck that you can't buy the full game.

1222
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Maybe that's coming later after people play some of the arcades. Who knows?

1223
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Silent Hill Downpour.

1224
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
We have some new stuff on Silent Hill Downpour.

1225
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
It's music from the game.

1226
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
But here's the thing. It's not by Akira Yamaoka.

1227
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Sad face.

1228
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Yeah, unfortunately, he's out of the picture.

1229
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Remember, he went over what the rumor is he's doing something with EA that maybe we'll see more about at E3 this year.

1230
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
He is no longer with the Silent Hill team.

1231
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
So who have they brought in?

1232
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Well, they've brought in Dan Licht.

1233
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
He does Dexter, the music from Dexter on Showtime.

1234
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
So I don't know if you know that show.

1235
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
There's actually a little clip that's rolling around the internet.

1236
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
We can play a little bit for you right now.

1237
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
At least I can try.

1238
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
See, it has an interesting sound to it.

1239
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,000
But to me, it sounds a little more orchestra.

1240
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Whereas Akira Yamaoka felt a little more like dude in the basement banging random things together that made for an awesome soundtrack.

1241
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I don't know how to explain it.

1242
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
This sounds like he's actually trying to emulate Yamaoka.

1243
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:11,000
But, yeah, because it's got some of the same, like the mandolin in the background and some of the...

1244
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I really think he's trying to emulate Yamaoka's style.

1245
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Well, sure. Everybody loved him.

1246
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
So it'll be interesting to see what this full thing looks like when it comes out.

1247
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Obviously, you can't tell from just a minute and a half clip.

1248
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Alright, that's going to do it for Rapid Fire News. Let's move into some Twitter topics tonight.

1249
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
And see what you guys are tweeting us at twitter.com slash o-l-r.

1250
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

1251
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Oh, a few tweets tonight.

1252
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Let's see, Spazinator wants to give us an update on what's going on in the video marketplace.

1253
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Not too much new in terms of freebies to announce aside from a preview episode of An Idiot Abroad on both PSN and XBL.

1254
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
What the hell is An Idiot Abroad? I've never heard of that.

1255
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Surely that's not an anime. Is that a reality show?

1256
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I've never heard of this before. I'm Wikipedia-ing it right now.

1257
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
An Idiot Abroad.

1258
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Let's see, an entertainment travel documentary on Sky One and Science Channel.

1259
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Starring Carl Plinkinton.

1260
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
And Ricky Jervis is in it, too. Well, that's pretty cool, I guess, if you're a fan of him.

1261
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
An Idiot Abroad.

1262
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Let's see, SHO 100 Matt is tweeting us, resident hockey fan here with some game-related news.

1263
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:34,000
A minor league hockey team celebrates SNES NHL 94 style.

1264
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
He gives us a link there.

1265
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,000
And, let's see here, I guess, what is this?

1266
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I was playing on my old console, Super Nintendo, one day and I scored a spectacular goal.

1267
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
And this is from one of the goaltenders of the Blazers.

1268
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Everyone just stopped and threw their sticks over their heads.

1269
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
And I thought it was the funniest thing ever.

1270
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:00,000
So it looks like when they actually scored a goal recently...

1271
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:07,000
They started waving their sticks over their heads just like they did in the game. That's cute.

1272
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
That's funny. I like that.

1273
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
That guy doesn't even have a stick. Look at him.

1274
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:19,000
What happened to that guy? He lost his stick. He's just waving his hands in the air.

1275
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I don't know why that's really funny, but it is.

1276
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And SHO 100 Matt continues with another tweet saying,

1277
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Also, two friends got me this awesome painting by 8-bit video game painter Adam Shub.

1278
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I guess is the name of the person that did that.

1279
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
And I can't see the link that he put...

1280
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Oh, I see this one, though.

1281
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Oh, is that like the Earthbound?

1282
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I get linked to a DeviantArt page called Square Painter.

1283
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,000
That's kind of cool. There's like a Ninja Gaiden picture and an Earthbound picture. That's pretty rad.

1284
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Very cool.

1285
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Dark Tetsuya tweets us and says,

1286
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:58,000
On the topic of Daft Punk, any of you guys ever seen Interstellar 5-5-5 or Interstellar 4-5?

1287
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Freaking epic anime set to their Discovery album.

1288
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I've seen the one clip, like One More Time was a whole little anime thing.

1289
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
They all are.

1290
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
But I haven't seen the whole thing together. I've only seen that one song.

1291
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It's all by the anime artist. It's the guy that did Galaxy Express and that kind of stuff.

1292
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
But yeah, I've watched the whole thing. I actually had the DVD at one point.

1293
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Might still have the DVD. I don't know.

1294
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
But yeah, I've watched it. It's pretty awesome.

1295
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Gotcha.

1296
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Got a tweet as well from Leo Shen.

1297
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:31,000
The MBC, Marvel vs. Capcom of course, 3 final boss has been leaked.

1298
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And we get to a YouTube here that says Galactus boss fight in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1299
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
That apparently is the final boss.

1300
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
There's this whole fighting going on on a TV.

1301
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,000
This is probably very no-no that this is out here on the internet, but now it's out.

1302
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
So there it is. They're fighting Galactus. That's the final boss.

1303
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
He was awfully stunted for Galactus.

1304
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I think he's in the background.

1305
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Let me see. Yep, here he comes.

1306
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Oh yeah.

1307
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
There you go.

1308
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Yeah, that's cool.

1309
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
So what you're fighting is Pinky.

1310
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Mm-hmm.

1311
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Wasn't he the boss in like one of the other ones? Wasn't it 2 he also the boss in?

1312
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
I thought it was Onslaught.

1313
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I think Onslaught was the boss in the first one.

1314
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Damn.

1315
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
The second one, no I don't-

1316
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
You suck.

1317
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I don't remember now actually.

1318
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I know it was in Galactus.

1319
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:32,000
And everyone keeps picking on Galactus. All he wants is a sandwich made out of, you know, a planet.

1320
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Alright.

1321
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Tigerclaw sent us some links, but sadly they are stories that are coming up later, so I gotta save those for a little later.

1322
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
That does it for Twitter tonight.

1323
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us some tweets in the future.

1324
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
We'll get to those later on.

1325
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Alright, let's move on with some more stories.

1326
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Loki.

1327
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Yes.

1328
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:56,000
So, this is kind of cool I guess if you're either lazy or you are disabled.

1329
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
For me I'd say it's because I'm lazy.

1330
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:08,000
But MLB 11, they are including a one button association for the signaled virtual athletes mode.

1331
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
And basically what it'll allow you to do is play the game using one button.

1332
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:20,000
And it's gonna have AI handling all the fielding and the player only needs to press one button in order to swing the bat or pitch.

1333
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:28,000
And it allows gamers who might not be able to throw a baseball in real life or wield a dual shock controller ease of play.

1334
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
So that's pretty awesome.

1335
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:43,000
And apparently the mode was inspired by Hans Smith, a baseball superfan with cerebral palsy whose limited mobility made it impossible for him to play a real baseball game as well as a video game as well.

1336
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:49,000
And Sony San Diego added him to last year's MLB game as an avatar.

1337
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:56,000
And then this year they went one step further with the disability friendly gameplay mode.

1338
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
So that's pretty sweet.

1339
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Well that's kind of cool. I like that they kind of did that, you know.

1340
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Do you get to play online in the one button mode? I don't know, I can see people that don't need to be using that mode using that.

1341
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
But hopefully that's not the case.

1342
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Well if you think about it, if you could do that, you know.

1343
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Get matched up against other people who are using that mode or something, I don't know.

1344
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Well that's kind of cool.

1345
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Eat a pizza and play the game at the same time.

1346
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:30,000
That's kind of like, some role playing games let you do that. Like, I remember, it was like Final Fantasy or something had the one hand mode where you could just, oh yeah, Bayonetta had it too.

1347
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Bayonetta had a one button mode.

1348
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
That's right.

1349
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I'm not sure if that was for disability though.

1350
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:40,000
It probably wasn't actually, so we shouldn't make a mockery of a good thing that they're trying to do here in this game.

1351
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I think that's kind of cool that they're making it more accessible.

1352
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
One handed mode.

1353
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
So, there's a big big difference between that one handed mode.

1354
01:35:49,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Alright, well if you think maybe there should be more games like this that are easily accessible to those folks, or maybe there's just a really cool idea you have for an indie game, maybe this site is something you want to take a look at.

1355
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It's kind of a spinoff of a site called Kickstarter, which honestly I had never heard of until this project kind of came across my path.

1356
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
8BitFunding is the name of the site. 8BitFunding.com.

1357
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
It's what they call crowd sourcing.

1358
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Basically, you can donate to different projects and you might get something or a perk in return.

1359
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
So, there might be these games that need help.

1360
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
They need money to fund the games or what have you.

1361
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:38,000
And if you buy into it, maybe with a certain amount, maybe they'll promise you 10% of the gross receipts.

1362
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Or maybe you'll get a cameo in the game.

1363
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Or maybe the developer will come over to your house or something like that or develop something for you in exchange.

1364
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:53,000
So, kind of an interesting little thing is when I was first reading this, I was like, okay, so this is basically like a PayPal donation button.

1365
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Donate to my game. What is the big deal about this?

1366
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
But it's kind of some of the perks that they're offering.

1367
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
In fact, I'm kind of looking at the site right now.

1368
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Unfortunately, a lot of these games have not really raised a whole lot of money.

1369
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:12,000
They did the same type of thing with this. I think it was on the, not this 8-bit funding type, but the other one that was group sourcing.

1370
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,000
It was for the Cthulhu, was it Cthulhu Saves the World or something like that?

1371
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Yeah, I remember that.

1372
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:26,000
They were doing the PC version and having all these different things that you could donate and get a character in the game and stuff like that.

1373
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Right. You know, I'm looking at some of these projects and all of them are looking for like $20,000, which I'm imagining must be the cost of a dev kit or to get the game online.

1374
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I don't know. But let's see, like I notice the game that has the most money right now is The Boo Keeper.

1375
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,000
$105 is how much they've raised towards their $20,000 goal.

1376
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:49,000
But the site is still new, so who knows. I'm trying to look at some of these little perks they offer here.

1377
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:55,000
They're trying to get this in 86 days. Oh, they have like a little video as well from the developer. That's kind of neat.

1378
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And they actually will give a game for a $5 project or two games for $20.

1379
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:11,000
A thank you package for $50. That's kind of interesting. Give your voice to a character for $1,000.

1380
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:17,000
So that's kind of neat that they have like little perks like that if you really believe in one of these games.

1381
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,000
And I like how they have like the little video from the developer telling you a little more about the game. So that's pretty cool.

1382
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:30,000
So check that out. Even if you don't have any money, it's kind of neat just to hear about some of the indie games and some indie developers and the trials and tribulations they go through.

1383
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:39,000
8bitfunding.com. What I also noticed was here was a magazine was posted on here that they're trying to fund an actual magazine for $1,000.

1384
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
It's an indie gaming magazine. Kind of neat.

1385
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Maybe we need to get some of these people on our show to hawk their products. Who knows? Could be interesting. I like hearing about new ideas.

1386
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Alright. So 8bitfunding.com. Let's move on to some more stories. Dark Soccer?

1387
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Well, how about something on Kid Icarus?

1388
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
How about it?

1389
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Well, it's not going to be out until after E3. Or Zelda for that matter.

1390
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:10,000
They're actually saying that, of course, we've mentioned earlier that neither of those are going to be launch titles for the 3DS.

1391
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:19,000
That they are going to be out early June which is right after E3. So it's speculated.

1392
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Maybe that's going to be because they're going to be improved maybe? We could hope.

1393
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I don't know though. When you said the news, I couldn't help but feel like this.

1394
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Yeah.

1395
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,000
But it's kind of the news I think we were all expecting, honestly. I mean, if the game wasn't coming out of launch.

1396
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I was convinced Kid Icarus was going to make it out of launch though. They made such a big deal out of that at E3.

1397
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
So it's kind of, last year anyway. So it's kind of shocking that it is delayed, but again.

1398
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It's just teasing, Rob. Teasing.

1399
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Well, you've got to make sure the game is great. Don't release a mediocre game.

1400
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
It's gaming foreplay.

1401
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:03,000
I'm all for them taking more time to do it if they need the time to make the game great.

1402
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:12,000
So, it's just a bummer they didn't have anything done, ready to go with the exception of, I guess, Nintendogs and, what is it, the submarine game or whatever other weird things they have.

1403
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Oh, they're doing Pilotwings.

1404
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
That's true. Pilotwings might be interesting.

1405
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I don't know though. I didn't feel Pilotwings 64 the same way I did the original S&S version, which is still one of my favorites.

1406
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I love Pilotwings on the SNES.

1407
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
So, there you go.

1408
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Anyhow, Loki, what do you have for us? The mailbag is coming up soon, by the way, you guys.

1409
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and soon your calls, the FUs of the Week, and so much more. Loki?

1410
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:43,000
There's a lot more disappointing Congressman coming from California. I swear to God, it's just...

1411
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
What do we have? Idiots working in Congress over here?

1412
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
No, I didn't vote for him.

1413
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
This time it's not Lee, though, so it is a different Congressman.

1414
01:40:52,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Joe Baca. He introduced against legislation back in 2009 that required games to display labels of warnings between violent video games and aggressive behavior.

1415
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Now, apparently, he's come back and now he's trying to pitch a similar thing.

1416
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:14,000
He's saying that he wants a warning to be put on these games.

1417
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:20,000
So, warning, excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior.

1418
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:30,000
And it says, I guess, the 2009 act failed to gain momentum, but he's now relabeled it the Video Game Health Labeling Act of 2011.

1419
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:36,000
And it's basically the same act with the same goal, putting warning labels on games rated Teen and above.

1420
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:47,000
And apparently now, I guess the only difference this time around is that he's gained support of Virginia Congressman Frank Wolf.

1421
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Which, I don't understand where a Virginia Congressman has any play in California, but whatever.

1422
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Anyways, it says, just as we warn smokers of health consequences of tobacco, we should warn parents and children about the growth and growing scientific evidence demonstrating a relationship between violent video games and violent behavior.

1423
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:21,000
As a parent and grandparent, I think it's important to have people know everything they can about the extremely violent nature of some of these games.

1424
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Which is great, because that's what's on the ESRB label. It shows you what kind of content's in those games.

1425
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:33,000
So you don't need to do this. I don't understand what the point is.

1426
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:40,000
But apparently they are trying to move that forward.

1427
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I think we probably have a message for the Congress people involved in this.

1428
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Shut the fuck up!

1429
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
That's how I feel.

1430
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Sounds good to me.

1431
01:42:52,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Like, you know, I mean, if you're gonna put warning labels on video games, you're gonna put warnings on movies, you're gonna put warnings on sugary candy, may it cause your kid to have a short attention span?

1432
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:14,000
If you, I mean, I'm sorry, but first off, violent video games don't affect everybody the same way, and there hasn't been, there's been studies that go both ways with that. There's nothing definitive about it.

1433
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:23,000
And we already have a label on the box that shows what kind of content's in the game. It shows if it's violent.

1434
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
And if you read the back of the box, you can get a pretty good idea too.

1435
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
You don't need, you know, another label.

1436
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:41,000
You know, if you're gonna buy a game called Zombie Massacre, you know, 2011, the back of the box, you know, is probably gonna indicate to you that it's probably pretty violent, and that you will be massacring zombies in the game.

1437
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:49,000
You know, you're not suddenly gonna get, you know, a game with puppets and rainbows and, I don't know, whatever. Stupid.

1438
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Puppet Rainbow Massacre.

1439
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
That would be a little bit different.

1440
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
They did that in an episode of Angel.

1441
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I mean, I'm sorry, but isn't there, like, a budget to be balanced? Aren't there jobs that need to be created?

1442
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Yeah, this stuff does cost money. I mean, and why are these congressmen, you know, like, wasting time on this stuff?

1443
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Seriously.

1444
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Especially California congressmen.

1445
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
There's a word for it.

1446
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Two words, actually.

1447
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Budget allocation.

1448
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Funding.

1449
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:26,000
In what? They're trying to get donations for their 2012 campaign by pleasing some moral superiority board?

1450
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:36,000
It's the stuff like that that actually pulls in other funds for the different areas of, uh, the different committees and different stuff that they're trying to allocate money to.

1451
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
They have the big problems because they need to go through and do a whole big audit.

1452
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
And they need to have the audit done by someone not in government but by an outside party.

1453
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:48,000
So, in other words, if this type of movement didn't exist, the committee might get folded?

1454
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Probably.

1455
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Then fold the fucking committee!

1456
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
This is a waste of our goddamn time!

1457
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Everybody's goddamn time!

1458
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Agreed.

1459
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
One more time, Congressman Joe Baca, I'm expressing my First Amendment right and telling you-

1460
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
This is also Baca.

1461
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Whatever.

1462
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
That's funny.

1463
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Moron.

1464
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Shut the fuck up!

1465
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Thank you, Pendlet.

1466
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
But, that was funny because, never mind.

1467
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Anyhow.

1468
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:21,000
If that's the best thing that committee can come up with, then it deserves to be folded.

1469
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Moving on.

1470
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I can hear it in my head now.

1471
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
You mad?

1472
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Yes, I am mad.

1473
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Alright, let me move on. Sorry.

1474
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Sarian.net. Remember that website? That was the website where you could play action Sierra games, adventure games, like King's Quest and all this stuff.

1475
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
You could play it on your iPad.

1476
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,000
And we were all sitting here going, just a matter of time before this thing gets shut down.

1477
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Yep, we are waiting for this thing to get shut down.

1478
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Guess what happened, guys?

1479
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
It got shut down this week. That's right.

1480
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:58,000
And the letter from Activision's legal counsel got posted on the website for everybody to read.

1481
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
And I liked how some of this email went.

1482
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:12,000
While we appreciate your dedication to the Sierra Classic Library and understand that you are a fan of these games, Activision has not authorized the development or distribution of these games via your website.

1483
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Accordingly, we must demand that you immediately cease any further distribution or exploitation, I like that word, of the Sierra games on your website.

1484
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Now, as much as you want to paint Activision as the big bad evil people, I don't know.

1485
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:33,000
They kind of do have a point. I mean, it is their games and this whole thing, posting them public, you know.

1486
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,000
But if you're not going to do anything with it, then what the hell are you doing?

1487
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:43,000
However, it could be argued that these games are available for sale on good old games and on Steam.

1488
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,000
So if you're going to get these games, then you should do them the legitimate way.

1489
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:53,000
And if Activision wanted to do an iPad release of the game, well, then this website is kind of getting in the way.

1490
01:46:53,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Well, there is another interesting development that happened this week that's worth mentioning, and that is that it wasn't totally shut down after the cease and desist.

1491
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:10,000
It looks like Activision ended up giving Sarian approval to continue running in a limited capacity.

1492
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Sarian.net is now able to publish the first game of any series in its multiplayer HTML5 form.

1493
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
So I guess this whole new little way of doing it is available.

1494
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:27,000
However, the iPad versions are no longer there because they might want to develop it sometimes.

1495
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:33,000
And Activision has allowed at least that, which I think is somewhat generous.

1496
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
There are also links to buy the games on Steam on the website.

1497
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
This is free advertising for retro titles.

1498
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:46,000
It is. So, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like, as much as you want to hate Activision, you can't say they're not doing anything with this.

1499
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:58,000
You are able to buy the games legitimately out there somewhere. So, I don't know, it's a little bit hard for me to get mad at Activision for cease and desisting, somebody trying to give that away for free.

1500
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:07,000
It does pain me that Activision continues to do nothing new in this genre, but I guess at least we always have the silver lining.

1501
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Which, by the way, Episode 3 was delayed.

1502
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
But it'll be coming out when it's ready.

1503
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I see what you did there.

1504
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
That's right.

1505
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Let's go to the mailbag!

1506
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you can send us your emails every week.

1507
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And I gotta say, guys, the emailbag is still in a pretty sad state.

1508
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:34,000
We got one email this week, and it's not signed, so I'll just say it's from Adam H.

1509
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Wanting us to talk about the PSP2 or the NGP.

1510
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
And linking us to the blog where we can talk about that.

1511
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Well, I think we did go over pretty much the big stuff.

1512
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
And done.

1513
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
That's right, we did go over the big stuff in Part A.

1514
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I will give the courtesy of looking at this website here and see if there's anything we didn't cover.

1515
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Because you never know, there might be little stuff that falls through the crack or whatever.

1516
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Let's see.

1517
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Nope, screenshots, got those.

1518
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Uncharted Portable, yeah.

1519
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
5-inch organic light-emitting display.

1520
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
We already mentioned that.

1521
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Or did you use the word organic?

1522
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I did OLED.

1523
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Okay.

1524
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
6-axis is in it, GPS.

1525
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Yeah, I think we covered all this, dude. Sorry.

1526
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
But, hey.

1527
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
There's some nice little pictures. I like the whole back touchpad.

1528
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Looks kind of funny with all the little PlayStation symbols over and over.

1529
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,000
So yes, our mailbag is in kind of a sad state tonight, I'm sorry to say.

1530
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you want to help us out for future weeks.

1531
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
It'll fold your laundry, wash the cat.

1532
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
That's right.

1533
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
So meanwhile, let's get into some FUs, some angst.

1534
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I have three FUs, and I love you.

1535
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
My FUs go to-

1536
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Aw, I love you too.

1537
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
My FUs goes to being sick, because I hate it.

1538
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:09,000
My second FU goes to the CW for playing Supernatural by a week, because dammit, I've been waiting for this damn episode.

1539
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
It's like, stop teasing me.

1540
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:25,000
And then FU to all of the people in the torrent community who decided to capitalize on the fact that certain people don't actually watch active TV and download the episodes as a torrent and decide to put out a virus torrent.

1541
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Which, thankfully, the moment you see the Windows error, you know, codec thing, you have to stop it before it goes to whatever site to update the codec.

1542
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
So it doesn't, you know, actually virus you.

1543
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
So yeah, stupid.

1544
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:42,000
And my love you goes to Dan, because he's been taking good care of me.

1545
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Aw.

1546
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
You're a little sick there, Rob.

1547
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Yeah, I mean, I think I caught whatever you guys have.

1548
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Rob's got our plague.

1549
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
All right.

1550
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Loki, you have an FU of the week.

1551
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Mainly just to Xbox 360s being so delicate and fragile that they'll break within five minutes.

1552
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
What, did you drop one?

1553
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I didn't drop one.

1554
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I didn't have to drop one.

1555
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I turned it on.

1556
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:15,000
And then I switched the monitor resolution and it went ehhh and died.

1557
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
So no.

1558
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
The original consoles, man.

1559
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
I swear, if you have a Xenon console, it's going to die.

1560
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:26,000
It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

1561
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,000
That sucks.

1562
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
I don't have a lot of FUs.

1563
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Things are relatively well right now.

1564
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
So I'll just say FU to money or lack thereof.

1565
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Never having enough of it.

1566
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
FU to Disneyland being crowded yesterday.

1567
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
That's never fun to go on a crowded day.

1568
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Everybody else needs to go somewhere else when I'm there.

1569
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,000
And I guess FU to the fact that I didn't get to spend enough time there.

1570
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
It really was just like a fast, fast trip.

1571
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
So, yeah.

1572
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
That's really it.

1573
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Otherwise, things are pretty good.

1574
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,000
If those are my FUs, then things are pretty well in my world.

1575
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Let's move on.

1576
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
A couple more stories for you guys.

1577
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,

1578
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.

1579
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Please make sure before you call us,

1580
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Echo123, if you are on Skype, you must, must, must test yourself first.

1581
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I think even Skype puts in there now,

1582
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
click this button to make a test call.

1583
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
You need to do that before you go on the radio.

1584
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Yes, listen to the nice lady that says, you know,

1585
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Hello, welcome to the Skype call testing service.

1586
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
You need to hear her before you hear us, so please do that now.

1587
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
But if you're using the phone, that's easy.

1588
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
You can just pick it up and call.

1589
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
All right, but we're not taking the calls just yet.

1590
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
We got a couple more stories for you first.

1591
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Loki.

1592
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:40,000
One other thing that was announced during the PlayStation conference,

1593
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
and it wasn't necessarily the PlayStation phone,

1594
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
it was the PlayStation Suite.

1595
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:49,000
And what the PlayStation Suite is, is actually a couple things.

1596
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:55,000
First off, it's gonna be a PlayStation store that's gonna be available for Android phones.

1597
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:03,000
They'll allow you to purchase different PlayStation, you know, things,

1598
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:08,000
whether it be PlayStation 1 games or other, you know, PSP minis or whatever.

1599
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Those are gonna be available as well.

1600
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:16,000
But you may remember when there were some of the leaked videos of, like, the PlayStation phone out,

1601
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
this was actually one of the things they could have been running on.

1602
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Of course, they were running a third-party homebrew PlayStation emulator,

1603
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
but I mean, assuming that works, and obviously this works just fine.

1604
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:32,000
And of course, some of the games that they're mentioning that are gonna be available

1605
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
are actually early PlayStation 1 games.

1606
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Cool Borders 2, Syphon Filter, and Rallycross, Wild Arms, and MIDI Evil.

1607
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Yay, the same fucking PS1 games I already played on the PS3 again.

1608
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
How about PS2 games?

1609
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Come on, there's a huge market.

1610
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
You know, PS2 is like ten years old, some of the early games at this point.

1611
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
The oomph to be able to do PlayStation 2.

1612
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Well, I thought the NGP is gonna bring the PS3 experience in your pocket,

1613
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
and it's a powerful fucking little thing.

1614
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
It can't play a PS2 game? Really?

1615
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Well, this isn't for the NGP, this is for phones.

1616
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Oh, my bad.

1617
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
This is for Android phones.

1618
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Or the Android iOS.

1619
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Because we can't really say it's just for phones now,

1620
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
since they do have tablets now with the Android iOS.

1621
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Oh, I remember something about this is all gonna tie into the NGP as well, too, right?

1622
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Android OS, not iOS, what am I saying?

1623
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Yeah, so it's a way to get PlayStation content out there on more than just the PlayStation phone.

1624
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,000
So, neat.

1625
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,000
But honestly, though, I mean, just looking at...

1626
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Unless you have that PlayStation phone, I can imagine this is gonna suck,

1627
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
just because, I mean, just look at the controls.

1628
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
It takes up, like, so much screen space, it's just ridiculous.

1629
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Yeah, touch controls are ridiculous, too.

1630
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
You need tangible buttons. Forget it otherwise, honestly.

1631
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Yeah.

1632
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
That's the one thing we've learned from iPhone gaming.

1633
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Very few iPhone games really, really work.

1634
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
They have to be designed for that touch.

1635
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Things like Cut the Rope work, because it's very easy.

1636
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Things like, I guess, Angry Birds, although I've never played it, work,

1637
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
because it's based around the touch controls.

1638
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Things like a port of Mega Man fail,

1639
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
because you need tangible controls in order to be able to play it.

1640
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
I will say that Espagaluda worked very well with touch controls.

1641
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Really?

1642
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Yeah, but that's because it has auto-fire and stuff.

1643
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I did it without auto-fire.

1644
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
It actually plays really well.

1645
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
And Mushihime-sama was really fun.

1646
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
I don't know. I just, I need tangible buttons.

1647
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
I thought that was all Sony's thing with the move.

1648
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Don't you like buttons?

1649
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Whatever.

1650
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Alright, one more story for you guys before the Skype line tonight,

1651
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,000
and it has to do with World of Warcraft, but it's kind of an interesting one,

1652
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
because you know where WoW goes, other MMOs tend to follow.

1653
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
This is kind of interesting.

1654
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
WoW has gone after gold sellers in a whole new way.

1655
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
They have successfully petitioned PayPal

1656
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
to issue notices to all the big gold selling companies that are out there,

1657
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
that if they don't stop WoW's virtual currency selling,

1658
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,000
then their accounts will be suspended permanently.

1659
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Very interesting, because these places are in other countries and so forth,

1660
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
and they accept PayPal as a method of payment,

1661
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
which a lot of folks don't want to give companies,

1662
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,000
well, folks shouldn't be using these fucking things in the first place,

1663
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
but on the other hand, when they do use them,

1664
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
they don't want to use their real credit card info,

1665
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
so they'll often use PayPal.

1666
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Well, now they've kind of cut off that bridge,

1667
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
so I think that's kind of cool that they did that.

1668
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
That was a smart way to go about doing it.

1669
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
So yeah, that's how they're going after it.

1670
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Cut out the middle man.

1671
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
And they could kind of strong arm PayPal too,

1672
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,000
because I'm pretty sure they take PayPal as a method of payment for the game itself,

1673
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
so they could tell PayPal either do this

1674
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,000
or we're going to stop taking your thing as a form of payment.

1675
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
They could kind of strong arm it like that.

1676
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I'm not saying that's what they did, but I could imagine that being part of the conversation.

1677
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Why not?

1678
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Makes sense.

1679
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Play hardball.

1680
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,000
But I did like having PayPal for like for Star Trek Online,

1681
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
because I would buy Cryptic Points to get my unlocks.

1682
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Right, but those are official.

1683
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
That's not like buying gold.

1684
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,000
No, but I mean, I think it's convenient to have it there,

1685
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
like if you want to get like a little thing here or there.

1686
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:23,000
And certainly, you pay 10 bucks and get 1200 points,

1687
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
which I bought tons of stuff with my points.

1688
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:35,000
So I think that they need to be a little bit more judicious with what they will and won't accept via PayPal.

1689
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Yeah, and honestly, if you buy gold online for WoW,

1690
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
your own account is going to get hacked inevitably,

1691
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
and you're just encouraging those people to continue to hack accounts,

1692
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
because where do you think that gold comes from?

1693
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Hardworking players, you know?

1694
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
So if you buy gold, you suck.

1695
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,000
There are people that will help you out if there's something you really need to buy.

1696
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Get a guild.

1697
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Don't buy gold online.

1698
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I heart the guild.

1699
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Oh yeah, because they've helped you out.

1700
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Yeah, I know.

1701
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Find a guild.

1702
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
You don't need to buy gold.

1703
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Find a guild of nice people.

1704
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
And don't steal from your guild.

1705
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Yeah, don't steal from your guild.

1706
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,000
If you're in the game to just profit profit and steal everything from your guild,

1707
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
then you're in the game for the wrong reasons.

1708
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Play the auction house game if money making is what you want.

1709
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Buy out a certain item and then sell it for triple.

1710
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I don't know.

1711
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
All right, let's open up the Skype line right now.

1712
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1713
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
The phones are open.

1714
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Take your calls on any topic we've talked about tonight.

1715
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Maybe you have a comment on the NGP itself.

1716
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Maybe you want to talk 3DS.

1717
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Maybe you want to talk about that whole PS3 hacking mess,

1718
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
or something we haven't brought up yet.

1719
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Whenever you want to talk about the phones are open,

1720
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:47,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

1721
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,000
While we wait for those calls to come in,

1722
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Loki, do you have any quick last minute stories for us?

1723
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
No, not really.

1724
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Well, not yet.

1725
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Actually, that Galactus video, that was someone that was playing on a pirated Xbox 360 version.

1726
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Naughty, naughty.

1727
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Naughty, naughty.

1728
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Because you can see the 360 in the background there.

1729
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Uh-oh.

1730
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Uh, let's see.

1731
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Some other fun stuff we could talk about here.

1732
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Um, this is kind of neat.

1733
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
We haven't mentioned this yet.

1734
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Platinum's new game that's coming out, Max Anarchy.

1735
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Well, at least it's how it's known in other places.

1736
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
It's coming over as Anarchy Reigns.

1737
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
It's kind of an MMO brawler game,

1738
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,000
and it also features the main character from Madworld,

1739
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
but in full color this time.

1740
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
And he's actually kind of in all the trailers and stuff.

1741
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Honestly, though, I kind of like him better black and white.

1742
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
He doesn't look that cool when he's not in black and white.

1743
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I don't know. That's just my opinion.

1744
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Alright, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

1745
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

1746
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Hi, this is Bazinator.

1747
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Hey, Spazinator. What's on your mind, buddy?

1748
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Well, since it's too much the topic of the night,

1749
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:03,000
I just want to chime in on the NGP or whatever it's called.

1750
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Whatever they end up calling it, sure. What are your thoughts?

1751
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Well, even though some people within the dial game community

1752
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
would like to pick me as Sony fanboy,

1753
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,000
I'm a little hesitant to even consider getting the NGP.

1754
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Although the system does sound nice on paper,

1755
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:33,000
but the truth is, even with my PSP, I very rarely touch it.

1756
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Hell, nowadays I will use it for downloading podcasts and whatnot,

1757
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
and that's about it.

1758
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Let me back up. Why did you abandon your PSP?

1759
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Was it a lack of the games that you have to play,

1760
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:51,000
or what caused you, I don't know, are you a DS player now,

1761
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
or what caused you to abandon the PSP?

1762
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Well, I was a DS player for a while, too.

1763
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I had both systems, but truth be told,

1764
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:10,000
there's more games on the PS3 and the 360 that I would much rather play.

1765
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:16,000
For example, on the 360, I constantly play Game Room,

1766
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:22,000
and on PS3, I play a lot of Super Stardust HD, so on and so forth,

1767
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
and between the two main consoles,

1768
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
there's more games on there that I'm interested in,

1769
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
as opposed to handheld.

1770
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Considering that I'm on the budget,

1771
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I have to watch how much I spend on games,

1772
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,000
and don't really have enough money to go all the way around,

1773
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
I would rather play my games on consoles, as opposed to handheld,

1774
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:49,000
because really, isn't the point of handhelds to go out and about

1775
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
and play them when you're not at home?

1776
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:59,000
And I'm usually home pretty much 24-7.

1777
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Well, at first, yeah, I did play my PSP a lot initially,

1778
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,000
playing the Darkstalkers games and the ports of PS2 games,

1779
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:14,000
but I just generally find myself playing the system less and less.

1780
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,000
So it's kind of the price that freaks you out, too, though,

1781
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:22,000
because you mentioned that you have a very limited budget,

1782
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
kind of like I mentioned earlier.

1783
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,000
There's just certain people, especially in this economy this day and age,

1784
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
that don't have a lot of the extra money,

1785
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
and they kind of know this is going to be expensive.

1786
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,000
So is it kind of like the price that scares you, too?

1787
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Yeah, basically, yeah.

1788
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:43,000
I live under $800 a month, and that basically,

1789
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:51,000
that $800 a month not even has to go towards rent, food,

1790
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:55,000
my time order bill, so on and so forth.

1791
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
There's not a lot of room for entertainment out there.

1792
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Yeah.

1793
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Granted, I managed to keep my expenses low

1794
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:06,000
because the cost of living in Buffalo, New York is pretty low,

1795
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
but still, even with that,

1796
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:14,000
that leaves me with roughly $200 a month that if I'm lucky,

1797
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I'm able to save and whatnot.

1798
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
In fact, it took me like a year just to save up for this netbook

1799
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,000
that I just recently got.

1800
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Well, let me ask you this.

1801
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Let me ask you this, though, because obviously,

1802
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
the system is expensive.

1803
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Do you think you would use or try to save up anyway

1804
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,000
for one of the competitors to a PSP2?

1805
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Is there something that maybe interests you more about the 3DS

1806
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
or maybe even the iPad, you could say,

1807
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
as a competitor of the NGP, whatever it's called?

1808
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Is there either of those that maybe interest you more

1809
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
that you would save up for, or no,

1810
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I'm not interested in this wave of technology at all?

1811
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:56,000
It's kind of hard to say just now

1812
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,000
because obviously, all those systems aren't quite out yet.

1813
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:05,000
If I do consider going out and buying any handheld,

1814
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,000
whatever, whether it be 3DS or PSP2 or what have you,

1815
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:15,000
I would have to wait just to pull a figure out,

1816
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:19,000
but let's say a year, year and a half,

1817
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
wait to see what comes out for whatever system

1818
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,000
and see if those games would interest me.

1819
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Then maybe, yeah, I'll consider getting them,

1820
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,000
but if nothing of interest comes out for me,

1821
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:36,000
like at least bare minimum, I don't know, 15 games at least,

1822
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
then I'd just say forget it.

1823
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:43,000
So in other words, it's the games that are on the system

1824
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
that are going to make it or break it for you.

1825
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Yeah, and they would have to be like exclusive games,

1826
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:56,000
not found on the home systems, no ports of any kind,

1827
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,000
I mean truly exclusive stuff or interoperability.

1828
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,000
I hear you, buddy.

1829
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
It's our golden rule of gaming,

1830
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
a system is only as good as the games that are on it,

1831
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:10,000
so I think it's a smart approach for a budget gamer to wait and see.

1832
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Let the people that have more disposable income

1833
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
kind of beta test everything for you, I suppose.

1834
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
So Spazinator, I've got to let you go to get more calls,

1835
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
but thank you as always, and who knows,

1836
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
maybe you'll win a contest at a local store,

1837
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
maybe win one of these guys for free.

1838
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I'll be hoping for you.

1839
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
All right.

1840
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Yeah.

1841
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Have a good one, buddy.

1842
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,000
All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR is our number,

1843
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

1844
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,000
if you want to give us a call.

1845
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,000
SSG100Matt agrees in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

1846
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
The price will be key.

1847
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Bonds006 says, I am PC till death.

1848
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
That's an interesting way of looking at it,

1849
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
especially from the whole budget perspective,

1850
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,000
is that, well, I have this PC anyway.

1851
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
There's tons and tons of games available on PC.

1852
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Why even bother with a handheld or even a console?

1853
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
I've got everything I need right in my PC.

1854
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
That's the way a lot of people look at it, surprisingly enough.

1855
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,000
877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1856
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Do we have any other last-minute stories, Loki, to hold us over?

1857
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Do we get more ringy rings?

1858
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Let's just see here what I've got here.

1859
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
What can you pull out of your butt, Loki?

1860
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:19,000
What can I pull out of my butt?

1861
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Let's see, can I have this all pulled up, too?

1862
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I don't want to know what Loki can pull out of his butt.

1863
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I meant, like, story-wise.

1864
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Not actual.

1865
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Yes.

1866
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
There was a whole lot, actually.

1867
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,000
It's funny, this week, I was surprised that there wasn't a whole lot of news

1868
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
other than the PSP stuff.

1869
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Sure, other than that big press conference, that's really it, I guess.

1870
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:46,000
It was just kind of like, wow, isn't that P or NGP awesome?

1871
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,000
It's so awesome.

1872
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I wonder how much it's going to be.

1873
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,000
And then, you know, 3DS was like, anyone remember about me?

1874
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I just got announced last week.

1875
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Oh, I think by the time the 3DS comes out, that will change quite a bit.

1876
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Yeah.

1877
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Well, we got another call.

1878
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
You're saved.

1879
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
You can find something else for after this.

1880
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1881
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Who's this?

1882
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Hi, this is us for show on demand.

1883
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Well, hey, I haven't heard from you in a while.

1884
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
How you doing?

1885
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
I'm doing good.

1886
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

1887
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:21,000
I actually wanted to kind of give a mini review on a game that no one's really talked about.

1888
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Let's hear it.

1889
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
But it's gotten a lot of controversy.

1890
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
I played Galgun for the Xbox 360.

1891
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Galgun, okay, okay.

1892
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Set the stage.

1893
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,000
What type of game is Galgun?

1894
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Galgun is a very perverted shooter.

1895
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
It's a dating sim shooter, I should say.

1896
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
All dating sims should be shooters.

1897
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Okay.

1898
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
I'm interested so far.

1899
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:51,000
So it's gotten a lot of controversy in it because Microsoft...

1900
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:55,000
I posted a video in the chat room.

1901
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:00,000
There's a lot of panty shots and a lot of questionable material in it.

1902
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:06,000
So a friend of mine has a Japanese 360, so we bought it.

1903
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:14,000
And we played it, and I felt immediately dirty afterwards.

1904
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:20,000
You spray your love on them, by the way.

1905
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
This game looks disgusting.

1906
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,000
This looks like Elibits, but with girls.

1907
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Little school girls.

1908
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,000
I'm sure they're all 18 or over, I'm sure.

1909
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Yeah, of course, of course. And you also get to shoot at teachers and all that, so...

1910
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:40,000
This looks like Elibits. Is this like Elibits?

1911
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Remember that game on the Wii?

1912
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Yeah, well, you know what the funny thing when you mention that is?

1913
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:49,000
The whole game has the feeling of a Wii game that was rejected,

1914
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:53,000
but it was ended up cut out on the 360.

1915
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
They wouldn't give up.

1916
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:59,000
All right, so usually games like this end up being crappy,

1917
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
but you felt dirty afterwards.

1918
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Was she tied up by a plant? What the hell was that?

1919
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
A tentacle.

1920
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
There's a boss battle in it.

1921
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Well, the whole thing is centered around when you start the game,

1922
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
you have to choose a girl that you're interested in.

1923
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Now, the whole thing is you're trying to go through your high school and all that

1924
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
to try to get with this girl.

1925
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
And you have to go through all these women who are going after you,

1926
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:25,000
hitting you with postcards and, you know, typical anime stuff.

1927
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Oh my goodness, postcards.

1928
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
He might get a paper cut.

1929
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Yeah.

1930
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,000
So what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to use a gun

1931
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:40,000
that shoots pheromones at the teenage girls

1932
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,000
that makes them drop down in ecstasy.

1933
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
So it's like your love gun.

1934
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Yeah, it's a love gun.

1935
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I see.

1936
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,000
And, you know, there's a special mode where you can zero in on a girl

1937
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,000
and shoot her at specific parts of her body, like her legs.

1938
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:58,000
So there's like a Fallout 3 mode?

1939
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Yeah, there is.

1940
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
They're in the back.

1941
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,000
And, you know, there'll be parts where she'll try to stop you

1942
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
with her earring and, you know, certain things.

1943
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Are you allowed to shoot these girls in the butt or do they not like that?

1944
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Yes, you can shoot them in the butt.

1945
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Wow.

1946
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
And, you know, it's funny because, you know, the game's so dynamic

1947
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:22,000
that, you know, different girls have different hot spots, I should say.

1948
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Where you get an ecstasy bonus, as it's called.

1949
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Okay.

1950
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,000
So, Matt, this is either like the best game ever or the worst game ever.

1951
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
So where does it fall?

1952
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
It's both.

1953
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
It's both.

1954
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Because it's just so fucked up.

1955
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,000
And you know what?

1956
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
I was looking at it.

1957
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
The people who made this game made a lot of kids' games.

1958
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
They made, you know, the X-Men Zero series.

1959
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,000
They actually made Mega Man 9 and 10.

1960
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:53,000
So this is their chance to release some steam, so to speak.

1961
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Yeah, I guess so.

1962
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
But, you know, the whole thing is, you know, it's very ridiculous.

1963
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,000
And, you know, it's kind of tough to play because it's a dating statement.

1964
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
It's all in Japanese.

1965
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,000
There's no English.

1966
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
And it's never going to come in America.

1967
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,000
So we're kind of guessing through the whole thing.

1968
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,000
But, you know, there's a lot of minigames and bonus stages.

1969
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
You know, they're ridiculous.

1970
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:15,000
But it's a ridiculous game.

1971
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Ikuma JP is in our chat room and he actually lives in Japan and he says,

1972
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

1973
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
This game does not exist.

1974
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:30,000
You might have to check, like, the back room of a store.

1975
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Like, I don't know how they have it set up in Japan.

1976
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
But I'm looking at this on YouTube.

1977
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,000
This looks real and I've heard of this before.

1978
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
I just want to see the tentacle monster one more time.

1979
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Wait, was that sheep?

1980
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
What the fuck?

1981
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I would say if Loki has a Japanese 360, you should get it.

1982
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Just for the last.

1983
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Loki, I think you need to bring a copy of this to the show one night.

1984
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Come on, it's episode 400 next week.

1985
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
What do you say?

1986
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
You need to figure this out.

1987
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
You need to get one of these.

1988
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,000
You need to import one of these real quick and get it over here to the show.

1989
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Expedite the shipping.

1990
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
All right.

1991
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
So anyhow.

1992
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,000
That's bad.

1993
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
You know, I had to take a long bath after this.

1994
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
It just felt so terrible.

1995
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:17,000
I'm sure those girls have to take a long bath too to wash what they got off.

1996
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
I'm watching him shoot the teachers.

1997
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
All right.

1998
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,000
All right, Matt.

1999
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,000
I want this game.

2000
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Thank you for bringing this into our lives.

2001
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
How can we ever repay you?

2002
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:28,000
I totally want this game.

2003
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I totally think you should get a game.

2004
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,000
All right.

2005
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Thank you for the call, Matt, and bringing this game into our lives.

2006
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Take care, buddy.

2007
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Bye.

2008
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Oops, I missed.

2009
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Oops, I accidentally hung up on him early.

2010
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Sorry, Matt.

2011
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
All right.

2012
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,000
1877 game OLR.

2013
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Our username on Skype.

2014
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Orange on the radio.

2015
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
AkumaJP says, just kidding.

2016
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I have seen it.

2017
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Estacy shot.

2018
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
That's funny.

2019
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
It does totally look like a rejected Wii game.

2020
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
All right.

2021
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:56,000
We've got time for a couple more calls, I suppose.

2022
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
I don't know if you had another story for us, Loki?

2023
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Just real quick stuff.

2024
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
No Kid Icarus or Zelda until after E3.

2025
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Yeah.

2026
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
DarkSaga did report on that.

2027
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
You were probably playing Grand Theft Auto.

2028
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
No, I wasn't playing Grand Theft Auto.

2029
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
You were playing Galgun.

2030
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,000
I was not playing Galgun.

2031
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Of course, let's see here.

2032
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Seriously, we have like, Atlas is bringing out Divinity II, the Dragon Knight saga, which

2033
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:26,000
is kind of an update to Divinity II with all the extra bonuses.

2034
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,000
That's coming out in May or April.

2035
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,000
By the way, there was some chatter earlier that accused me of never listening to Loki.

2036
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I just want to point out it's been proven it goes both ways.

2037
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Oh, I never listen to anybody.

2038
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
It's called multitasking.

2039
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:48,000
That's how we do this live show where we interact with the chat room, talk to each other, and

2040
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
take calls, like the call we have on the line right now.

2041
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2042
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Who's this?

2043
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

2044
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Hey, this is excellent.

2045
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Hi, how are you, buddy?

2046
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Doing good.

2047
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:04,000
I don't know how I'm going to, I don't know what to say now.

2048
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
I'm flabbergasted compared to that last caller.

2049
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
That's all right.

2050
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,000
That's the one update.

2051
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I don't know if I can do that.

2052
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,000
You're becoming like the Ranma of the new year.

2053
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
You're getting on this show every week.

2054
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
That's interesting.

2055
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
But hey, if no one else is calling in.

2056
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,000
No, I try not to.

2057
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,000
It's all you, buddy.

2058
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
I try not.

2059
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:25,000
I don't try to call unless one, you need the calls, or two, I have something to call in

2060
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,000
about.

2061
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,000
All right.

2062
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Well, what does it happen to be tonight?

2063
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
One or two?

2064
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Two, actually.

2065
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
All right.

2066
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
What do you have to talk about tonight?

2067
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I want to talk about the next gen.

2068
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Yes, please.

2069
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
A lot of people talk about that tonight.

2070
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
I think the price point is even scaring me.

2071
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:43,000
I liked what they were... Well, I was going to say, a lot of the things I liked when I

2072
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:48,000
saw... I was watching the coverage as it came out, and I liked the little bit that

2073
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:55,000
I saw, and the fact that I could actually have a handheld that plays quality games of

2074
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:00,000
that of the PS3 would be absolutely amazing, but the price point, the fact that I know

2075
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:04,000
it's going to come out, it's going to be like, oh, it's $799 or $800.

2076
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:07,000
So that's what's going to scare me more than anything.

2077
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:10,000
That one will be like, okay, I'm going to have to put that in the back burner for like

2078
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:14,000
three years before getting in and trying to catch up with everybody else, so...

2079
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,000
It will never sell if it's over $500.

2080
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Sorry, I just... This is the perfect time for us to kind of take a step back.

2081
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Let's hop in the time machine and go back to five years ago, 2006.

2082
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,000
You ready?

2083
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Back in 2006, it was the Sony E3 press conference.

2084
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
You ready?

2085
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Here you go.

2086
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Ridge Racer.

2087
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:45,000
The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change, and the consumers are ready.

2088
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Genji 2 is an action game which is based on Japanese history.

2089
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Ridge Racer.

2090
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles

2091
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:02,000
which actually took place in ancient Japan.

2092
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,000
So here's this giant enemy crab.

2093
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Ridge Racer.

2094
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:12,000
And you attack its weak point for massive damage.

2095
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
It's Ridge Racer.

2096
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Ridge Racer.

2097
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:20,000
PlayStation 3 will retail for $599.

2098
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
$599.

2099
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
$599.

2100
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Giant enemy crab.

2101
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
$599.

2102
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,000
$599.

2103
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
$599.

2104
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
It's Ridge Racer.

2105
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Ridge Racer.

2106
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Can't wait for E3 this year.

2107
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Sony always brings the lols.

2108
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:42,000
By the way, that's one of my favorite YouTubes ever.

2109
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Ridge Racer.

2110
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,000
That's one of my favorite YouTubes on the entirety of YouTube.

2111
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,000
It's the Sony press conference in one minute.

2112
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:54,000
For the love of God, make a new Ridge Racer game.

2113
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Ridge Racer.

2114
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Let's see here. Ridge Racer for the Xbox was the same as Ridge Racer 7.

2115
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Was the same as Ridge Racer on the PSP.

2116
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Was the same as Ridge Racer on, well actually the PSP version was like 4.

2117
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:17,000
But the 3DS version is basically the same as Ridge Racer 7 and Ridge Racer 6.

2118
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:20,000
All they're doing, they're not even putting any new effort into it.

2119
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:24,000
It's like, eh, let's put the game over.

2120
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
New cars, eh, let's port the game over.

2121
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,000
X-ominor think that'll cost 599 US Crabs.

2122
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Alright.

2123
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Those are historically accurate crabs.

2124
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Alright, I'm sorry X-Link. We're getting away from what you wanted to talk about.

2125
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Did he, X-Link?

2126
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
No, no, it's quite alright. I'm not gonna keep it too long.

2127
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:46,000
It sounds like our connections seem pretty bad here, so.

2128
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Uh, well so, so-

2129
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:51,000
But no, I just wanted to say that though, because you know, a lot of people, you know, like, I'm in between jobs right now.

2130
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:55,000
I don't have 599 dollars to spend.

2131
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:01,000
I don't, I do have a job and I don't have 599 US dollars to spend.

2132
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Uh, I'm a little freaked out with the price.

2133
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:09,000
This thing better blow me if it's gonna be that much money.

2134
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:13,000
I better just do more than that. My god.

2135
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:18,000
This thing better come with a love gun or something, I don't know.

2136
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Alright. If they do, if they port gal gun-

2137
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Start talking to you sexually?

2138
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:26,000
To the NGP. Yeah, I wanted to talk dirty to me for 599 US dollars.

2139
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
I know, Rob.

2140
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:32,000
If there's a gal gun on the NGP, then I might be able to be talked into it. I don't know.

2141
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Well, you know, this is gonna be a fun year nonetheless for E3.

2142
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:44,000
And it's gonna be a lot of fun because this is gonna be probably the year of let's see who wound up who and what category and what area.

2143
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:47,000
So, yeah, this is gonna be a lot of fun, I have to say.

2144
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
He's shooting his love pheromones into that plant's mouth.

2145
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I can't, alright.

2146
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,000
XLink, I'm sorry, they're still fascinated with gal guns, so I gotta let you go.

2147
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
But have a good night, and thanks for calling.

2148
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Appreciate it.

2149
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Yeah, no problem.

2150
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Later.

2151
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Yes, you too. Okay, bye bye.

2152
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Oh my god, poor Inksfall on her from Ragnarok.

2153
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:11,000
It's gal gun! Gal gun!

2154
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Ah, now everybody in chat's just being dirty.

2155
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Ah, you're all being dirty. SSJ100Matt says, Fleshlight attachment coming in June 2012.

2156
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Well, since you all are being dirty, let me bring this up.

2157
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Have you all heard of that show My Strange Obsession that's on TLC, the network that brings you hoarders and intervention and all that?

2158
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:35,000
If it's got midgets or multiple kids, it's on our network.

2159
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:41,000
TLC now has the show My Strange Obsession where they like to show things like there was the chick that ate couch material.

2160
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Yes, I remember that.

2161
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,000
She ate the foam inside couches. A chick that slept with her blow dryer.

2162
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,000
I saw that.

2163
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Well, this week, or maybe it was this last week, I don't know, they are going to have a guy who is infatuated with his real doll.

2164
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
His love doll.

2165
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Good lord.

2166
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:00,000
That believes he is married to it or something like that. I don't know what the deal was.

2167
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:05,000
It was something like he treats the doll like it's a real person and sleeps with it at night.

2168
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Wasn't that a movie?

2169
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
More than one way.

2170
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:11,000
This is real life, apparently. This is not like Weekend at Bernie's. This is the real deal.

2171
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:15,000
No, it wasn't. They had a member of us with... I don't remember the guy's name.

2172
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Nah, I think I know what you're talking about. Was that Simone? About the virtual chick that comes to life?

2173
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
No, no, no, no.

2174
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
De Niro was in that, but that movie went straight to video.

2175
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Oh.

2176
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:29,000
No, there was a movie about this guy who had a love doll or something like that.

2177
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:35,000
And it was like him and the whole town kind of pretended it was real.

2178
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
For no reason. I don't know.

2179
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,000
That sounds like a dumbass movie.

2180
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:42,000
It was one of those fucking artsy films. I don't know what it is.

2181
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:46,000
It was one of those things where I was like, really? I'm not gonna go see that.

2182
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Something the wife made you watch?

2183
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Oh, I forgot to mention! Oh my god.

2184
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Gaming Week. Totally forgot.

2185
02:20:54,000 --> 02:21:01,000
This week we had this kind of a kickoff for the 2011 year type thing.

2186
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:07,000
They had people from different branches out and stuff and they were doing these team building events and stuff like that.

2187
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
From Salacious Pop, Lance and the Real Girl.

2188
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Yes, that's it. Thank you.

2189
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Anyways, because I'm too lazy to look that up.

2190
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:24,000
So they had a bunch of Connect Adventure games that we were competing in teams for high scores and we win stuff.

2191
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:32,000
And I'd like to say that two out of the three days we kicked the crap out of everybody.

2192
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:40,000
The third day, or actually I should say the first day, we would have won had we played together, both myself and my co-worker.

2193
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Instead we were on separate teams with other people, which is why we lost.

2194
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:49,000
We won like $80 worth of movie passes.

2195
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Nice! What movie are you taking me to?

2196
02:21:53,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Well, we don't go to see movies very often, so when we do go we're gonna get popcorn, hot dogs...

2197
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
$80 plus your kids.

2198
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
$60 in bulk candy.

2199
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:08,000
It's just a matter of time before your kids are gonna wanna go see every Disney movie, so you know.

2200
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I mean, maybe a couple years, but still.

2201
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Yeah, a couple years.

2202
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
I just thought it was funny that we kicked the crap out of them.

2203
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Well, yeah, you're the video game team. You're supposed to kick the crap out of them.

2204
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Yeah.

2205
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Alright.

2206
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,000
It was awesome.

2207
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Well, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.

2208
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Thank you guys who got through.

2209
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,000
If you didn't get through, you can always email us.

2210
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2211
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,000
But we're gonna go ahead and start to wrap up the show tonight.

2212
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:34,000
It's a little early, but I guess it wasn't outside of the NGP.

2213
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Not a whole lot to say.

2214
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2215
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
We can just have an extra long after birth.

2216
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Uh, Darth Saker, your final thought tonight?

2217
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Uh...

2218
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Alright.

2219
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,000
And by the way, the chat room is yelling. It's actually Lars and the real girl, not Lance.

2220
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:53,000
And Salacious Pop says, it's actually really good, thank you very much.

2221
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
I heard it was actually good.

2222
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Thank you very much.

2223
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
It just looked dumb.

2224
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,000
You know, sorry.

2225
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
I don't know.

2226
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Alright.

2227
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:06,000
My final thought tonight is, it's like I'm walking on sunshine.

2228
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2229
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:17,000
My final thought is, I never would have thought that Pandora would introduce me to a bunch of awesome music that I never would have heard of, thanks to Pandora.

2230
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Although it also introduced me to a lot of crappy music and music that I've heard of, you know, numerous times.

2231
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:31,000
But, you know, it's a little difficult to hit, you know, the thumbs up and thumbs down while driving my car.

2232
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Good point.

2233
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Alright, well thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.

2234
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:40,000
If you've enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask you guys, tell a couple people about our show.

2235
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Word of mouth is how we spread the word.

2236
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
That's how we've been doing it for the past nine years.

2237
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:50,000
We're not able to advertise in video game magazines or have E3 booths or, you know, have any of that.

2238
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,000
We don't have a full-fledged team bringing news to you.

2239
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
This isn't our day jobs.

2240
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,000
We work very hard with balancing our family lives and all that stuff in this show.

2241
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,000
And that's all we ask.

2242
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,000
It's not a pity story.

2243
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,000
It's just all we ask.

2244
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Help us spread the word about our little show.

2245
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
And that's all we really want.

2246
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Leave us nice reviews on iTunes.

2247
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,000
All that fun stuff.

2248
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,000
And if you didn't like our show, fine.

2249
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Don't listen to it ever again.

2250
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
But support other indie podcasters.

2251
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
They do a lot of hard work.

2252
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Especially, of course, you know, we're a little partial to the folks at AllGames.com and the varieties of shows that are there.

2253
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:24,000
But even if you're like, I hate every single show on AllGames, fine.

2254
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,000
You're a real picky bitch.

2255
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:28,000
But there's got to be something in the indie universe that's for you.

2256
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
So support independent podcasting.

2257
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Thank you very much, guys.

2258
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Have a wonderful week.

2259
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:36,000
We will see you back here next week for episode number 400 OMG.

2260
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Until then, good night.

02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:41,000
