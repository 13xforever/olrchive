26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	41000	This is episode number 399 for January 30th, 2011.
41000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games with the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48000	49000	Hi.
49000	50000	Hi, how are you?
50000	53000	I am doing better than I was.
53000	55000	Yeah, I've heard you've been kind of sick lately. I'm sorry to hear about it.
55000	58000	Yeah, but I has warm drink. Thank you.
58000	59000	Oh, you're welcome.
59000	62000	And I have my fuzzy blue binky.
62000	65000	Not a Snuggie, but it kind of looks like one from far away.
65000	73000	It's very soft fleece and I think that I got this as a freebie from somewhere, but it's been super soft and goes with me on trips.
73000	75000	And it's like my comfort blanket.
75000	77000	Have you ever thought about investing in a Snuggie?
77000	82000	I saw one once. It was a knockoff with Kingdom Hearts patterns all over it. It did make me think of you a little bit.
82000	92000	I don't know. I like my blanket. If it was the same softness as this blanket. See, my blanket's really soft.
92000	95000	Oh, this is great radio, me feeling the blanket. Yes, there you go.
95000	104000	If it was just like this blanket, then maybe I could be convinced. But I kind of like being shrouded in my warm blanket and being able to pull it over my head if I want to.
104000	108000	Is it like a Linus from the Peanuts thing where it's like your security blanket has to go with you everywhere?
108000	118000	Well, no. But it makes me feel comforted when I feel weak and sick. And then I can use my really low warm blanket.
118000	122000	I just realized I touched that blanket when you were sick. I really hope I don't get it.
122000	124000	It's been washed, Rob.
124000	127000	Alright, let's also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
127000	128000	Hi.
128000	129000	How are you, Loki?
129000	130000	Sick as well.
130000	131000	Oh, no.
131000	133000	I caught my son's cold.
133000	134000	Oh my gosh.
134000	135000	The plague.
135000	136000	That's alright.
136000	142000	I feel like I'm marked because I haven't been sick yet. Dot, dot, dot. I really hope I don't get anything.
142000	145000	Well, sorry to hear about you being sick as well. I hope you get over it.
145000	146000	Yeah, it's fine.
146000	158000	But I have to point out, just before the show started while Bobby's show was finishing up here live at All Games Radio, you were giggling like a schoolgirl over there playing, what was it, Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC?
158000	160000	Yeah, episodes of Liberty City.
160000	169000	And it was really funny because you were listening to some gay dance music or something in the game while you were just blowing up.
169000	190000	Yeah, I was listening to the Russian electronic station in the game and then I was playing, well, I was working on map edits and then I decided, because I still have the crazy car handling in place still, that I'd play around with that, so that's what I was doing.
190000	191000	Gotcha.
191000	195000	Well, it looked like you were having fun because you were giggling as your car was spinning around and around and around and around.
195000	206000	Yeah, you're not supposed to be able to get into those cars because they go crazy, but since I have the trainer, I can spawn cars and make it so I don't fall off of motorcycles and stuff. It's fun.
206000	214000	Alright, and also joining us tonight, of course, you guys, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, as they have over the past, what, nine years we've been doing this show.
214000	227000	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com if you are listening to us live because we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
227000	238000	And yes, we are doing a show next week, which is very brave because we are going to compete against Super Bowl Sunday in some ways. I don't know, I think most of it's wind down. I think they're in like the last quarter by the time this show starts.
238000	256000	But next week's kind of a big deal for us because it's episode number 400. I don't think we're going to do anything too special. We might have some surprises in store, little things, but you know, we don't want to do because then we could do, we could do a 400th special, then we could do a ninth anniversary special, then we could do a 10th anniversary, you know, we don't want to overdo it with the special.
256000	257000	I like 10 aversaries.
257000	265000	Every week is special. Dang it. So we appreciate you guys listening to us over the past few years. Really appreciate it.
265000	277000	We're going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com. Tigerclaw says, it's funny that Snuggies have taken off considering the Slanket was the first one to come up with the idea. And Jim Sally says, Snuggies now with 10% more Slanket.
277000	284000	So is Snuggie like the Zynga of the blanket making world? I don't know. Take with that what you will.
284000	296000	Alright, let's get into the show and talk about some video games and how is your gaming week and the types of video games you have been playing since you guys have been sick. I don't know if you guys have been playing some games, but let's see.
296000	297000	Dark Soccer, what have you been up to?
297000	316000	I've really just played World of Warcraft. Addicts. Dealer. Because I hate Icecrown. And I hated it so much that I was like, I just need to power level through it, need to get through with it, need to get through with it. I'm done.
316000	327000	And I have to thank Alan, by the way, for running me through that. I don't think it was a dungeon, but it was like some tournament area. And I think it was in Zildrak.
327000	330000	Oh yeah, the Ring of Blood or whatever it's called.
330000	353000	I could get the Slobberknocker. But it got me a crap ton of experience on top of it. So that saved me a couple hours of work and stupid quests to control water elementals, which sucked. And now I just did the joust thing.
353000	358000	Yeah, there's a little parody. And she's not talking like an actual joust thing, although that's in the game too.
358000	359000	You ride a griffin.
359000	366000	But there's like a make-believe 3D version of the old school 80s game, joust.
366000	384000	And you get a pet from it that's one of the little griffins with a dude on it with a lance. And you get to keep the lance. Although I'm gonna sell it for probably nothing that's worse. It's like a zero to one damage item, which makes me laugh.
384000	391000	And I'm actually having a really good time in the really pretty Cataclysm area. It's just really pretty.
391000	396000	Flowers and fairy dragons. I love fairy dragons. And I'll tell you why I love fairy dragons. From D&D.
396000	405000	My friend played a fairy dragon named Shimata Hentai. So I thought it was funny. And I'm done. I'm high on Sudafed.
405000	406000	It's gonna be a fun show!
406000	408000	Sudafed, Robitussin, and Benadryl.
408000	416000	Do you find that, wow, I'm still blown away every week this goes on. That you were a wow hater in 2010.
416000	417000	I wasn't a hater.
417000	420000	Yes you were. You turned it all around in 2011.
420000	421000	I wasn't a hater.
421000	423000	Okay, you were a disliker.
423000	425000	I was just bored by it.
425000	427000	Disliker's gonna dislike.
427000	440000	Well, you know me. I'm gonna give something a chance before I decide that I hate it. And enough, like I said enough, people said it's different that I had to give it a chance.
440000	444000	Speaking of MMOs, I gotta go to a comment from Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchrader.com.
444000	451000	He says his gaming week pretty much consisted of playing DC Universe online. Still haven't reached level 30. I think I'm around level 16 or 15.
451000	458000	So I've gotta kinda ask, are there any other MMOs? Cause I know you're a comic book, even though you're not so much DC. I know you're more of a Marvel girl.
458000	465000	Do any of these other MMOs interest you? And you've talked also about maybe I need to go back to Star Trek Online and check out what's going on there.
465000	472000	Well, I missed on Star Trek Online. And I do miss my fleet. They're cool guys.
472000	484000	I do want to go back to Star Trek Online for a month to see the new episodes. But I don't know. I mean, it really got to be super redundant.
484000	490000	And there's been enough different stuff going on in World of Warcraft that I think it's gonna keep my attention.
490000	497000	Cause I just get bored doing the same thing over and over again. Which is why I was really, really bored in Icecrown.
497000	507000	Except, I mean, once I got through all the cool Arthas stuff, I was like, ugh, boring. And I forgot to make him dance. See if I can make him dance.
507000	514000	But, um, I've liked all the little neat throwing stuff and I really haven't had enough of that in Star Trek Online.
514000	523000	I'm gonna give it another go. I mean, I love Star Trek Online. It was fun. I love everything about it. Except that I've run out of shit to do.
523000	525000	Except the endgame got old, basically.
525000	529000	Yeah, pretty much. And I don't like PVP. I hate PVP.
529000	533000	I'm kinda curious what you're gonna think of the endgame a while because I know you haven't done a lot of the grouping.
533000	542000	And to be honest, there's not a whole lot else to do. Well, I take that back. They've done a lot of stuff when it comes to reputations and crafting.
542000	548000	And there's kinda that to do. There's a lot of daily quests you can do. But I worry you're gonna find yourself a little bored when you get to the endgame.
548000	556000	Because even I'm getting a little bored at the endgame right now because our guild lost some people after the expansion just due to real life stuff.
556000	560000	And we haven't had enough to do any of the raiding, which is the big stuff you do.
560000	567000	Well, see, that's why I want you guys to show me the ropes. So that, you know, Wednesdays are gonna be bad.
567000	570000	It's the Rope Robot School of Warcraft!
570000	574000	Well, Wednesdays are gonna be bad for me because I have school until 1030.
574000	581000	But I wanna eventually get into it. You know, I got so wrapped up in questing and it was so much fun to me.
581000	583000	And I've got a Worgen now.
583000	590000	I gotta make my shopping list over here for WoW School. Okay, buy Sorting Hat for Jamie.
590000	597000	I have a Worgen now though. Because while I was feeling so sick and miserable, Dan decided to cheer me up by getting me Cataclysm.
597000	600000	And then promptly yelled at me for playing too much Warcraft.
600000	607000	But I named her Veruca Salt. With two A's. Veruca Salt.
607000	608000	Veruca! Alright.
608000	610000	Because I couldn't get Volkswagen.
610000	616000	Alright, enough MMO chat. Let's go over to Loki. I know he doesn't play any of them right now, so I'll ask him what he's been playing this week, Loki.
616000	622000	I've been playing, um, not a whole lot actually. Just, you know, mainly like Grand Theft Auto stuff because that's fun.
622000	628000	Just been dealing with... I had my JTAG system repaired and it died in five minutes when I got it back.
628000	634000	So I was like, uh, that sucks. So I sent it away to get it fixed again.
634000	639000	Um, I did play some stuff on the iPod yesterday actually. I played...
639000	644000	And you may remember this from when we were talking about it during one...
644000	646000	It was a news segment we brought up.
646000	656000	The game Hamlet. Or was it the last game not to feature MMO shading and some other elements or something like that?
656000	660000	I vaguely remember a story on this. So I remember making the comment like,
660000	662000	how in the hell are they gonna make a game out of that? That sounds...
662000	664000	It was actually pretty awesome.
664000	666000	Some college kids project gone pretty long.
666000	674000	Yes. Hamlet or the last game without MMO RPG features, shaders, and product placement. HD was the game that I played.
674000	681000	And, um, basically it's like a point and click adventure game, except really dumbed down. In a way.
681000	688000	Um, it's dumbed down the fact that you don't have an inventory. You don't have any real exploration or anything.
688000	694000	It's just okay. It's one level, and then the next room you're in, and the next room you're in, and you have to solve a puzzle in each one.
694000	697000	And there's about 20 some rooms.
697000	700000	So I was able to finish the game in like three to four hours.
700000	705000	But, um, it's really got a unique style to it. I mean, it's not...
705000	714000	It is Hamlet, and it's not. It's like, um, if the creators of Ren and Stimpy created a version of Hamlet, it's basically that.
714000	716000	It's just weird.
716000	719000	I love Ren and Stimpy. It's powdered toast, man!
719000	724000	No, seriously, the art style kind of reminds me of, like, Ren and Stimpy. It's just very weird.
724000	726000	Okay, now I'm interested.
726000	727000	Um, but it's...
727000	730000	Who from our generation didn't love Ren and Stimpy?
730000	735000	Yeah, you play this, like, um...
735000	740000	What rolls downstairs, hops over in pairs, runs over your neighbor's dog.
740000	752000	You play this, like, time traveler or whatever who comes back to, I guess, Hamlet and accidentally crushes Hamlet, and he, you know, he's injured, so you have to basically do all the things Hamlet would have had to do.
752000	755000	And they've already teased a sequel, which is gonna be Romeo and Juliet.
755000	756000	Hamlet 2?
756000	758000	There's gonna be Romeo and Juliet.
758000	759000	Hamlet 2, Electric Boogaloo.
759000	767000	Bummer, because the Hamlet 2 movie is one of those movies. I actually watched the movie. Do you know they have, like, a movie called Hamlet 2, and it's about a guy who's putting on stage? It's a comedy.
767000	774000	And, like, it's actually not very funny, but it's one of those things that's, like, so stupid, you kind of laugh in some parts.
774000	775000	Rock me, Rock me, Rock me, Jesus.
775000	784000	Yeah, Rock me, Sexy Jesus. Like, it's so absurd, you have to laugh, because this movie clearly was just set out to offend people. And that was kind of funny.
784000	790000	Uh, but yeah, the game's pretty awesome. The only problem I have is that it's short, and once you've beaten it, there's really no reason to play it again.
790000	791000	So...
791000	792000	Is it a free game, though?
792000	793000	No.
793000	794000	Oh.
794000	795000	But it's cheap.
795000	797000	Okay. Well, as long as you kind of get what you pay for, so to speak.
797000	808000	Yeah. But it was a good game. It's just, it's, um, and some of the puzzles are pretty hard. You have to think about it, and they give you a little hint, but that hint sometimes doesn't really help you.
808000	817000	Um, but you can usually figure it out pretty quick. I mean, I played the whole game through without using any sort of, you know, cheats or anything.
817000	822000	Is Telltale in trouble? I mean, they are the kings of the whole point-and-clicky games right now.
822000	823000	No, it's a little different than that.
823000	824000	Okay.
824000	835000	It's more of like, you know, someone that hasn't really played an adventure game. I mean, it's very, okay, you solve this puzzle in this stage, you move to the next stage, and you solve this next puzzle, and they have little boss fights and stuff like that.
835000	836000	Okay.
836000	840000	And the boss fights are just very, very odd. The whole game is very odd.
840000	855000	Spaznator's in our chatroom saying that he bought some Ren and Stimpy episodes via PSN. I had no idea. See, I wouldn't know what the hell was on the PSN video store if we didn't have Spaznator in our chatroom every week or on Twitter or wherever he's at, because I never pay attention to what's on it.
855000	864000	I had no idea you could get Ren and Stimpy episodes. Can you even get those on Netflix? I don't even know. Like, I'm sure they're all on DVD, but they're probably all over YouTube as well. I don't know.
864000	867000	All right. Anything else for your gaming week you want to share with us, Loki?
867000	871000	No, no, that would be it.
871000	884000	Okay. My gaming week. Didn't play a whole lot of new stuff. I'm kind of having to penny-pinch right now, so I don't have a lot of money to spend $60 on new games, so it's kind of playing the games I have, which is WoW and some of the, you know, Xbox Live Arcade games.
884000	895000	But this is funny that I'm going to talk about penny-pinch and then talk about what I just did this weekend. But I took, like, a real quick suicide trip to Disneyland. That's where I was the past couple days.
895000	902000	That's not why there wasn't a Hoard House this week, though. We had a plan, but unfortunately, Plan B fell through. We'll get to that on that show.
902000	914000	However, yeah, I went to Disneyland, and when I was there, part of the reason I wanted to go was to see this whole Electronica event that they had. They had a Tron-themed dance party rave that they turned a whole section of Disneyland into.
914000	924000	And yes, this is video game related because they have several little attractions going on. Most of it is to just kind of draw people into California Adventure before World of Color starts, which is their big, big thing.
924000	935000	And California Adventure is kind of the struggling Disney park right now. While it has a few big, big rides that people love, like Tower of Terror and California Screamin', there's not a lot of reason for people to, like, stay there like they do Disneyland.
935000	943000	So Electronica's kind of a way to bring them in there. And they have a couple neat things. Like, they have a nine-minute preview of Tron Legacy, which is, you know, what you would expect to see in, like, a...
943000	954000	They turn the Muppets Theater into the Tron Theater, which is kind of funny. But they do, like, lighting effects where when the recognizer comes out, the whole theater glows red. Kind of cute little things like that.
954000	964000	But I'll tell you what was awesome and what has to do with gaming is that they took one of the old buildings that I believe way back in the day used to be the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire experience that didn't last very long.
964000	976000	And that building's just been empty for the longest time. Well, guess what they turned it into? Flynn's Arcade. They have a replica of Flynn's Arcade complete with old-school 80s arcade games.
976000	988000	And get this, because it's Disney and because, you know, everything has to work at Disneyland, it all works. Like, it's a classic arcade game where all these games feel like they're in, like, mint freaking condition.
988000	989000	That's fantastic.
989000	995000	I know. Like, there's just not a lot like it. There's very few arcades that take good care of their retro machines like that.
995000	997000	Did they say how long it's gonna be there?
997000	1001000	It's guaranteed right now on the calendars through March 25th.
1001000	1003000	That means we should be there when we go...
1003000	1012000	But people are thinking, like, oh, maybe it's not gonna last through April when the Blu-ray's coming out. But my other thought is what are they gonna replace it with?
1012000	1019000	Electronica replaced what they called Glowfest, which was the same type of thing, really. It just didn't have a Tron theme to it.
1019000	1027000	And when you see the Tron stuff, it's pretty rad what they did. But there's not a whole lot else to see besides that classic arcade and everything.
1027000	1040000	But it's crazy because this arcade is full of people. There is a freaking line to play the Tron game, which they have perfectly placed in the back with a little subtle cutout in the wall.
1040000	1045000	Once in a while, you'll see things glowing behind. I mean, it's perfect, this replica they've set up.
1045000	1054000	And they even created... This is the thing that just freaked me out. They created a game called Space Paranoids that they have in an arcade machine.
1054000	1063000	And it's clearly running on a PC because it doesn't use tokens, but it's like in a cabinet. And it's like a 3D game where you go around and shoot recognizers, but you only have so many bullets.
1063000	1067000	It's pretty hot.
1067000	1070000	I think that's their browser. They had a browser game that was like that.
1070000	1075000	Yeah, it's probably just the browser game like as an arcade machine, so that's what that is.
1075000	1080000	And I played Dig Dug, which is one of my favorite classic games. Tease me if you will.
1080000	1083000	But I walked out of there with the number one score on the machine, thank you very much.
1083000	1084000	Nice.
1084000	1089000	So yeah, I don't know if it resets every night or what, but hey, I was happy for a minute.
1089000	1095000	So it's whatever makes you happy, I guess. Even some pinball! They had a Whirlwind machine. Or what is that called? The one that blows the air on you?
1095000	1097000	Yeah, that's Whirlwind.
1097000	1098000	Yeah, pinball machine.
1098000	1099000	That's Whirlwind.
1099000	1102000	Yeah, some of that too. And they play 80s music very loudly while you're in there.
1102000	1103000	Lots of journey.
1103000	1113000	Yes. Like I heard of Bananarama and some of the stuff. But every time they play Journey is when the arcade will start flickering and kind of doing that very Disney effect.
1113000	1119000	If you are anywhere near SoCal, you gotta see it. Like if you're an arcade enthusiast, you gotta see it.
1119000	1131000	Like just at least once. It's a pretty cool thing to behold. I mean I can't say like it's a loan worth the, what is it, $90 price it costs for a one day park hopper or whatever.
1131000	1138000	That's pushing it. But if you're gonna be going to Disneyland anyway, you gotta like make sure you're gonna see this somehow.
1138000	1146000	I really hope that they went to all this work, that they just keep it open. Like really, they weren't using that building for anything else.
1146000	1150000	Just keep the damn thing open until you have something really, really good to replace it.
1150000	1157000	Because it looks like they spent a lot of money converting that building into Flynn's arcade. Don't, I mean even if they're gonna end Electronica, keep the freaking arcade.
1157000	1160000	Don't get rid of it. Please Disney.
1160000	1165000	So, yeah. Folks in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchrader.com.
1165000	1169000	Shezro says, wow, Flynn's replica. Nice. Yeah, I agree. It was pretty awesome.
1169000	1176000	Let's see. Bochikawa says, that sounds awesome. It was pretty awesome. I mean it was crowded though. I mean, gosh.
1176000	1180000	I only had time to really play like the one game. So there you go.
1180000	1184000	Tigerclaw says, Skye, are they blasting the Daft Punk soundtrack all over the park?
1184000	1190000	Actually, no. They don't. They do some of it, especially during the pre-show leading up to it.
1190000	1195000	But you know, when the dance party's going on, it's mostly Top 40 remix stuff.
1195000	1199000	But they have people decked out in Tron outfits that are like up there dancing.
1199000	1203000	And I felt kind of cool because when I say cool, like this is like super nerdy.
1203000	1209000	But I actually bought a replica identity disc that glows up when you hit a button on it.
1209000	1212000	And I was like carrying that around with me and my friend Melody who I was there with.
1212000	1215000	Because this is kind of our makeup trip from her birthday.
1215000	1220000	When the, I don't know if you remember this episode of OLR, when the plane caught on fire before us. Yeah.
1220000	1224000	This is our makeup trip because we didn't get to go that weekend.
1224000	1229000	She had two of the discs. One blue and one orange and like everybody was coming up to her asking her like where she got the discs.
1229000	1233000	And it was just from the freaking souvenir stores. And you can get the blue ones at Target actually.
1233000	1235000	They have them at Toys R Us.
1235000	1237000	Yeah. So they're not hard to find but it's just kind of funny.
1237000	1242000	So Zeba wants to know if I took any pics. Yes I did. I actually took some video too.
1242000	1248000	So I'll try to kind of put that all into a compilation video and upload that to YouTube or something if you want to see.
1248000	1250000	I'll try to get that up later.
1250000	1256000	Alright. Anyhow. So that was really it. That was Tigerclaw in our chat says top 40 music. Yuck.
1256000	1262000	I actually, I might be misrepresenting a little bit. It's a lot of remixes of top 40 music.
1262000	1267000	But Tigerclaw I know you like the electric and trance stuff and I think you would be happy with the stuff that they played.
1267000	1269000	They played some cool stuff.
1269000	1275000	So I know my friend constantly had her phone out with SoundHound or whatever that program is that lets you identify songs.
1275000	1278000	Like what's this electronic song? What's this song? So it's kind of a mix.
1278000	1282000	Okay. Let's move on and actually get into the show itself.
1282000	1285000	First some housekeeping. Please follow us on Twitter.
1285000	1288000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R and also you can follow us on Facebook.
1288000	1291000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1291000	1294000	Next week is the 400th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
1294000	1298000	We'll be starting at 6 o'clock Pacific promptly 9 o'clock Eastern.
1298000	1300000	Bobby actually has the night off due to this.
1300000	1305000	There's some football game that people care about here that a lot of people are apparently going to be watching.
1305000	1307000	And we have the balls to go up against it.
1307000	1310000	But if you must listen on the podcast feed then I suppose you can join us there too.
1310000	1315000	But it'll be more fun I promise if you join us live next week for the 400th episode of O-L-R.
1315000	1318000	Alright let's get into tonight's gaming news.
1318000	1322000	There was some big stuff. Big conferences. Things to talk about right, Loki?
1322000	1327000	Yes. The big thing of course is talking about the NGP.
1327000	1335000	And the NGP is what I guess Sony is calling what everybody's pretty much dubbed the PSP2.
1335000	1340000	And it is one sexy looking piece of equipment there.
1340000	1347000	Of course they had a lot of the stuff that was rumored to be in there.
1347000	1353000	It's carrying a 5 inch OLED screen with pretty high resolution on it.
1353000	1355000	Four times the PSPs.
1355000	1357000	A front touch screen.
1357000	1359000	A rear touch pad.
1359000	1361000	3G Wi-Fi.
1361000	1362000	Bluetooth.
1362000	1363000	GPS.
1363000	1366000	Dual analog sticks.
1366000	1368000	And looks pretty awesome.
1368000	1373000	So yeah I've got to get one.
1373000	1376000	They didn't really give a price point.
1376000	1381000	It is supposed to be out at least in one region before the end of the year.
1381000	1387000	And I guess it looks like both the front and rear little touch pads are multi-touch.
1387000	1390000	It does have a front and rear camera as well.
1390000	1397000	Built in microphone. Of course it's also got 6 axis motion sensing.
1397000	1404000	Including a 3 axis gyroscope, 3 axis accelerometer, and 3 axis electronic compass.
1404000	1408000	Wait. You said something that I think I just totally missed during the press conference.
1408000	1409000	You said built in microphone?
1409000	1410000	Yes.
1410000	1412000	Is there a built in camera on this too?
1412000	1414000	Two. Front and back.
1414000	1417000	Oh this thing is going to have video conferencing then no question.
1417000	1420000	And that's something they didn't even really advertise.
1420000	1428000	Interesting. There's no other reason to put a front camera on the damn thing than to have some type of competing FaceTime technology or whatever you want to call it.
1428000	1430000	Something like that yeah.
1430000	1435000	And then Bluetooth and all sorts of other stuff.
1435000	1438000	But I'm pretty excited about it.
1438000	1447000	I mean a bunch of things I know they were mentioning of course it's going to be backwards compatible with PSP games like digital games so you can play PSP games on there.
1447000	1449000	PlayStation 1 games.
1449000	1453000	Yeah but wait a minute what if I have the games on UMD am I just kind of screwed?
1453000	1454000	Yep.
1454000	1457000	So it's compatible with PSP GO games?
1457000	1468000	But you'll be able to play that stuff on there and I would imagine that it's going to be fully compatible with the PlayStation 1 stuff now because now you have the dual analog sticks.
1468000	1476000	And they're saying that they're full analog sticks so I'm not sure if you can click down on them for the L3 and R3 stuff.
1476000	1487000	But as far as like the L2 buttons that right there is your back little touch pad you know you can just the right half is the right button the right the left half is the left button.
1487000	1500000	And then the shoulder buttons could be for everything else since I'd assume the multi touch stuff is probably going to be also pressure sensitive so that would be kind of sort of analog.
1500000	1508000	But that's pretty awesome and it looks very similar to what you know the normal PSP 3000 looks like right now.
1508000	1528000	They're going to also have I guess there's some some special slots for memory and games and stuff like that because obviously they're not using this type of rounds can be a proprietary format for both so it'll take just a little bit longer the crack I guess.
1528000	1534000	And then of course they were talking about some of the games that are going to be out for it as well.
1534000	1544000	Some of the games in the works Uncharted Killzone Resistance LittleBigPlanet and the game called Little Deviants which looks like the first kind of original game for the system.
1544000	1550000	Obviously you know most of their I'd say all of their big franchise games are going to be coming out there.
1550000	1560000	They did show Uncharted which is kind of interesting because Uncharted they had it where you could play it just like a normal PS3 game you know with the dual analog 6 and stuff like that.
1560000	1566000	Or you could actually play it with kind of like the touch panel like you could tap stuff and you know go to different spots.
1566000	1575000	So I guess trying to appeal to you know both hardcore gamer and casual you know phone gamer or whatever.
1575000	1586000	Other things that they were talking about coming out Call of Duty a game called Broken Gravity Days Hot Shots Golf Hustle Kings which is the billiards game.
1586000	1593000	Reality Fighters which is kind of an augmented reality fighting game which is kind of weird.
1593000	1597000	Resistance Smart As which sounds like a trivia game and Wipe Out.
1597000	1600000	That's not smart ass that's smart as.
1600000	1601000	Smart as.
1601000	1604000	Like smart as a 5th grader or something like that.
1604000	1605000	Gotcha.
1605000	1606000	I suppose.
1606000	1607000	Interesting.
1607000	1614000	Well they didn't name a price or a date but if you thought they were going to do that this early then you know you were kind of wishful thinking.
1614000	1622000	Because you know E3 is really the time to do that and let's face it when Nintendo first unveiled the 3DS they didn't say any of that either.
1622000	1628000	They just came out with the price and date what two months ago and now it's coming out in March.
1628000	1632000	So or no last month and it's coming out in March.
1632000	1634000	Are we talking about price and date for the 3DS?
1634000	1636000	Yeah it just came out a couple weeks ago.
1636000	1640000	Sorry I meant two months out of the actual release was when the dates came out.
1640000	1650000	So to think that Sony was going to release the release date of this and the price and everything now 11 months before release or whatever was a little bit no.
1650000	1652000	I bet they don't even know what it's going to cost yet.
1652000	1656000	They're probably trying to gauge the whole consumer reaction or also the price technology.
1656000	1659000	I mean it goes down so rapidly so who knows.
1659000	1667000	Price is kind of important obviously. I think it's too early to say if I really want to get one or not.
1667000	1670000	I think it really depends on what's all there when it comes out.
1670000	1675000	I'm definitely getting one just because I have store credit for the Sony store.
1675000	1678000	So $280 of that's already spoken for.
1678000	1688000	So as long as it's not like something stupid or ridiculous like $400 or even $400 might not be that bad with you know $280 taken out of the way.
1688000	1693000	I'm actually thinking $400 might not be completely out of the realm of possibility.
1693000	1700000	I don't think it's going to be $400 because it would be hard to justify a handheld system being more expensive than a console system.
1700000	1705000	Well here's the thing. You got to look at its competition.
1705000	1706000	I understand that.
1706000	1708000	I don't mean the 3DS.
1708000	1709000	I know what you're talking about.
1709000	1710000	The iPad.
1710000	1715000	And the iPad with 3G is what? $650 for the latest model?
1715000	1718000	Yeah but here's the thing.
1718000	1725000	Unless Sony wants to take the what I consider douchebaggy route of well you're paying for the Sony product.
1725000	1731000	The Sony name or level of you know wonderful that's in all of our products.
1731000	1732000	I'm sorry.
1732000	1737000	Apple may be able to get away with that because people have you know drank the Kool-Aid.
1737000	1743000	I mean honestly if I didn't get that iPod for free I would not be buying an iPod.
1743000	1747000	And I sure as hell am not buying an iPad.
1747000	1754000	I'm sorry but you know that may be if they want to play that gamble then go ahead.
1754000	1759000	But I think it's going to end up flopping on them just like you know the PSP Go.
1759000	1763000	Although this will be a little bit easier of an argument because it's you know a new system and stuff.
1763000	1767000	But you know they're talking that there's probably going to be multiple SKUs on it.
1767000	1769000	One for a 3G one for Wi-Fi.
1769000	1773000	Personally I'd just pick up the Wi-Fi one because I don't want a fucking another data plan.
1773000	1774000	Exactly.
1774000	1777000	Tethered to my fucking phone that's what I'm going to do.
1777000	1782000	I in dark he's gay in our chat room is dying for an educated guess from us gaming analysts.
1782000	1785000	Maha Maha Maha wants to know an educated guess for the price.
1785000	1787000	I'll give you my best guess.
1787000	1792000	I'm going to say three hundred dollars without 3G and four hundred dollars with it.
1792000	1801000	I think that's I think considering the level of technology they're trying to put in this thing and all these other little features and stuff.
1801000	1804000	I think that's not outside the realm of possibility.
1804000	1811000	However one big big wild card to keep in mind is Apple's next iPad.
1811000	1816000	Which they're going to have a big announcement and they're going to release it within the next couple months.
1816000	1820000	I mean that's you don't have to be an Apple psychic to know that.
1820000	1829000	So if they manage to really cut the cost of those things that could make Sony have to kind of do a counter move.
1829000	1833000	But seeing as I don't want to go too far out off base here.
1833000	1839000	But I believe those new iPads will probably have the same retina display that the iPhone 4's are using right now.
1839000	1842000	And it's going to make those things absolutely gorgeous.
1842000	1847000	They'll probably still be charging at least six hundred dollars if you want an iPad with 3GS.
1847000	1850000	So we'll see.
1850000	1853000	So Sony can still at least be cheaper than an iPad if they do that.
1853000	1858000	And I kind of think that's going to be where their niche could be.
1858000	1863000	Is that the Sony NGP could kind of be like cheaper than an iPad but does a lot of the same stuff.
1863000	1865000	At least as far as games are concerned.
1865000	1867000	So we'll see.
1867000	1871000	Rama Narachan says, can someone tell me what NGP stands for?
1871000	1873000	Next generation portable.
1873000	1878000	It is a working name like Natal was. Do not expect that to be the final name.
1878000	1883000	I would be very surprised if they really, I actually don't really care for that as a name.
1883000	1890000	Because, and somebody in the chat had said it earlier, by the time the NGP releases it's going to be the CGP.
1890000	1892000	The current generation portable.
1892000	1895000	So it would be a little silly for them to actually call it that.
1895000	1897000	Remember the Neptune.
1897000	1899000	That's right, huh?
1899000	1903000	The Dolphin was the Nintendo GameCube at one point.
1903000	1905000	Or the Revolution was the Wii.
1905000	1908000	So these code names, nothing new.
1908000	1911000	I'm very curious to see what they're going to name it.
1911000	1914000	I kind of don't think they would do PSP2.
1914000	1918000	It doesn't roll off the tongue as nicely as PSP.
1918000	1920000	You know what I mean?
1920000	1925000	I know that sounds really like nitpicky, but there's just something about, it's like all the extra syllables or something.
1925000	1931000	I know I'm being weird, but I just don't see PSP2 being it either.
1931000	1933000	I don't know. We'll see.
1933000	1938000	Let's talk a little more about what's going on with the new Sony system and it's this feature.
1938000	1946000	And I kind of like this, because I like to see what the systems are doing besides just remakes of the same old games now on a portable.
1946000	1949000	I like to know where are they going to be taking the games.
1949000	1953000	So I was very interested with this. Something called Live Area.
1953000	1956000	You might have seen some of the little promos, some of the arts.
1956000	1958000	This very bubbly sort of interface.
1958000	1963000	All these little bubbles. I don't know if they're taking a cue from Nintendo and making things a little bit cuter or whatever.
1963000	1966000	But one of the things in this interface is Live Area.
1966000	1970000	It's a game-oriented communication platform.
1970000	1973000	It's the name for the user interface that's built into the system.
1973000	1976000	That's what there will be instead of a cross-media bar.
1976000	1982000	And you're going to be able to get into the store, get into trophies, your friends list, a browser, and all this other stuff in there.
1982000	1986000	Every game is going to have Live Area presence as well.
1986000	1991000	Meaning that news can be fed right into the game and even other players that you're playing against.
1991000	1995000	Also, very interesting, there's going to be a Near Future.
1995000	2004000	It will track your location over time, create a map of where you've been, and I guess find other people that are playing games near you, physically.
2004000	2006000	So, could be interesting, could be scary.
2006000	2010000	You know, when I was first hearing about this, I don't know why, but something popped into my mind.
2010000	2017000	If they ever wanted to make Foursquare like an actual game, this might be the way to do it.
2017000	2019000	You know what I mean?
2019000	2021000	Yeah, that could...
2021000	2024000	I don't know. I mean, I don't know what the game is there.
2024000	2026000	Sounds so handy for stalkers.
2026000	2032000	Yeah, so the privacy things on this are going to have to be very, you know, whatever.
2032000	2037000	It's kind of interesting, some of the cute things they do with GPS sometimes in games.
2037000	2047000	For example, earlier I was talking about my trip to Disneyland and one of the things that you could do is that there's actually a Disney game for Toy Story Midway Mania that you can buy on the iPhone.
2047000	2057000	Well, if you happen to be in front of the ride and you launch the game, you get like a bonus feature that will unlock like, I don't know what it is, like a new background or a new gun or a new stage.
2057000	2065000	Something special that you can only get when the GPS knows you are at the damn ride at Disneyland or Disney World because they have it too.
2065000	2069000	So, it will be interesting to see kind of what the GPS technology kind of brings to games.
2069000	2071000	Very curious.
2071000	2073000	And people, you know what?
2073000	2077000	That Pokémon thing with the walking trainer and all that was really popular.
2077000	2085000	So, it's not outside the realm of possibility that people kind of like these ideas of being rewarded for going places.
2085000	2089000	3DS is doing something similar too with the whole coins thing, built-in pedometer.
2089000	2092000	So, it will be interesting.
2092000	2094000	Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
2094000	2097000	Well, news for our UK listeners.
2097000	2107000	The 3DS eShop is actually not going to, well, is not going to go live like they said it would with launch.
2107000	2110000	They actually said that it's going to go live in May.
2110000	2119000	Now, Nintendo UK said that it was going to be there with the launch, but Iwata basically said, nope, nope, nope.
2119000	2124000	The first system update is scheduled for late May, the same time around the world.
2124000	2127000	So, it's not just them. It's everybody.
2127000	2132000	I wish I'm glad Iwata came out and actually said something himself.
2132000	2137000	But, you know, they need to make sure that all of their reps are on the same page.
2137000	2139000	Don't you think?
2139000	2143000	Yeah, it kind of makes it sound like they don't even know when the damn thing is launching.
2143000	2145000	Kind of like, it'll be done when it's done.
2145000	2152000	It's going to be out in Europe on March 25th, but we won't have the eShop until the first system update.
2152000	2154000	It's just going to be in May.
2154000	2158000	Does it seem now that maybe they're rushing the 3DS a little bit?
2158000	2162000	Like, maybe they should have just waited to release it until summertime.
2162000	2168000	I mean, maybe there's something about May, like why you have to release it in that type of timeframe or something like that.
2168000	2176000	But, I'm sorry, March? I don't know why they couldn't have delayed this a little bit if it's not really ready.
2176000	2181000	I mean, they're going to sell most of these at Christmas time anyway, right?
2181000	2184000	That would be reasonable to me.
2184000	2186000	I don't know.
2186000	2190000	And I also say that because of the launch games.
2190000	2195000	You know, it kind of doesn't have the must-have title that's going to be out at launch.
2195000	2200000	I mean, probably the coolest stuff that's coming out of launch is what? The Street Fighter game?
2200000	2202000	The Dead or Alive game, maybe?
2202000	2206000	And maybe Nintendogs and Cats, if that's what you're into.
2206000	2210000	You know, but that's kind of a stretch for like a must-have launch title.
2210000	2212000	You know, that Kid Icarus game didn't make it.
2212000	2216000	You know, we haven't heard of the Zelda remake or any of that.
2216000	2218000	You know, none of that kind of made the launch.
2218000	2220000	So, I don't know.
2220000	2224000	What do you guys in our chat room think? chat.orangesoundsready.com
2224000	2229000	Well, I was going to say actually it does seem like that they're like,
2229000	2234000	Well, either we wait and put everything out together or we at least get the system out,
2234000	2236000	get some early sales going on.
2236000	2241000	And then once everyone sees what else is on the eShop, then we get another boost in sales come May.
2241000	2244000	That's sort of what I'm seeing of.
2244000	2246000	Go to our chat room at chat.orangesoundsready.com.
2246000	2249000	We're reading some comments from some of these other things we've been talking about.
2249000	2255000	Yizam says, The Pokewalker was awesome. Walk up to your fellow trainer and ask if they'd like to touch balls.
2255000	2258000	I saw a lot of that happening at PAX East last year when I went.
2258000	2262000	Spassinator says, I'm a bit paranoid about taking portable stuff out and about,
2262000	2265000	if only because I live in a rough neighborhood and I don't want to be jumped and robbed.
2265000	2268000	It's actually not a bad point.
2268000	2271000	Not everybody's going to want to find the players near them. You know what I mean?
2271000	2274000	That could be a little scary.
2274000	2277000	And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this name incorrectly.
2277000	2285000	Niparos says, It does seem Netflix has Ren and Stimpy.
2285000	2289000	Since we were wondering that earlier. Thanks for checking. Appreciate that.
2289000	2291000	Good to know.
2291000	2294000	Well, you know, the other thing too is that something like that actually might work in Japan.
2294000	2298000	Because you remember with all the stuff that was happening with Monster Hunter.
2298000	2302000	You know, that was such a big thing and people would just randomly challenge it.
2302000	2308000	It was a Nintendogs thing. That's something that I think would happen more often in Japan.
2308000	2311000	But not so much here.
2311000	2314000	Years ago, the barcode scanner.
2314000	2322000	You just got people that are more into it who will go to the cons and just walk through the street.
2322000	2324000	Oh god, I forgot about that game.
2324000	2327000	There was some type of battle game that was battle barcodes or something.
2327000	2329000	I remember that.
2329000	2332000	And they sold out of this one brand of ramen or something.
2332000	2335000	Because it created some uber monster.
2335000	2337000	And then there was the CD one.
2337000	2340000	What was the game that you put in your CD and you get a different monster based on the CD?
2340000	2344000	And you got this great monster by using Madonna?
2344000	2346000	Totally don't know.
2346000	2350000	But now it would be too easy to just burn your own CD.
2350000	2355000	Because obviously it was measuring track length and number of tracks or something. Interesting.
2355000	2360000	Alright, let's go to the next story then.
2360000	2364000	We'll chew on this 3DS news a little bit.
2364000	2366000	See what happens closer to launch.
2366000	2369000	And now back to more Sony news.
2369000	2376000	We talked about last week how the people figured out ways to load custom firmwares and stuff like that on their PS3.
2376000	2380000	So what's the first thing that happens when they do that?
2380000	2386000	Of course, release new PS3 firmware update or this could even go for the PSP.
2386000	2389000	And patch all that stuff out.
2389000	2391000	Or at least try to break it.
2391000	2393000	So that's what they did.
2393000	2395000	They released 3.56 firmware.
2395000	2400000	It adds no functionality whatsoever other than a security patch.
2400000	2406000	And it basically changed some of the keys on different things.
2406000	2415000	Kind of set everyone back a little bit in the hacking community because they don't have a way to modify the firmware yet.
2415000	2423000	Another thing it did is it banned people from playing black ops that were cheating.
2423000	2432000	Or were using modified game saves and other methods to cheat the game.
2432000	2439000	And they've permanently banned those people from playing black ops in multiplayer.
2439000	2442000	Yay! Cheaters get smacked down.
2442000	2445000	You just think about that future cheaters.
2445000	2449000	It's one thing if you want to cheat amongst people you know.
2449000	2454000	I don't care if you cheat in single player where you're not going online or any of that.
2454000	2456000	Or if you cheat with friends.
2456000	2461000	But going just to be power tripping in random online matches is a dick thing to do.
2461000	2465000	Dicks deserve to have dick things happen to them in return.
2465000	2467000	And you remember how they were saying,
2467000	2473000	Oh well there's no way for us to possibly stop these guys from cheating on our games.
2473000	2476000	There's no way. Oh poor us Activision.
2476000	2478000	Yeah I do remember that. That was funny.
2478000	2480000	Weren't they trying to use that as an excuse or something?
2480000	2484000	Well now that excuse is out of the way and hopefully they're going to fix everything.
2484000	2489000	I do believe there was a patch for the PS3 version as well to fix some stuff.
2489000	2493000	But now it's not an excuse.
2493000	2500000	Alright. Let me move on to what's coming in a future PS3 update if the rumors are to be believed.
2500000	2502000	And I would believe this actually.
2502000	2508000	Apparently there are some folks in the development community that are getting notices from Sony saying that in firmware 3.60
2508000	2512000	cloud storage for saved games will be available.
2512000	2515000	It's called online saving. They're not calling it cloud saving.
2515000	2518000	Maybe make everybody think of Final Fantasy 7. I don't know.
2518000	2520000	But they're calling it online saving.
2520000	2524000	This means that you could actually save files on a remote server.
2524000	2530000	So that way if I'm playing a game at home I could save to the online save and then access this at my friend's house.
2530000	2532000	That would be kind of cool.
2532000	2533000	There you go.
2533000	2539000	By the way this feature will only be available of course to PlayStation Plus subscribers.
2539000	2541000	Ha ha ha.
2541000	2542000	So there you go.
2542000	2543000	And this doesn't surprise me at all.
2543000	2548000	I seem to remember when they first announced the PlayStation Plus that this was one of the features they were touting.
2548000	2551000	So it's not too surprising that this is finally coming out.
2551000	2553000	Kind of a neat idea.
2553000	2555000	You know I kind of like that idea.
2555000	2558000	And if you go to your friend's houses and sometimes forget your save files.
2558000	2562000	Or hauling the memory cards around is too big of a bitch or whatever.
2562000	2565000	You know or you forget then it's a neat idea.
2565000	2570000	I kind of wish Microsoft had one too that didn't involve save cards.
2570000	2572000	So I think it's neat.
2572000	2574000	I don't know is this a feature you'd use?
2574000	2577000	I don't think anyone in here uses PlayStation Plus right now.
2577000	2579000	Is this something that might make you want to get it?
2579000	2580000	Nope.
2580000	2581000	No? Why not?
2581000	2588000	Because I don't ever take my game saves anywhere other than you know on my PS3.
2588000	2594000	And if I really was you know aching to do that I could just throw it on a jump drive.
2594000	2597000	Dark Sakura? Anything that would interest you?
2597000	2598000	It's a neat idea.
2598000	2604000	It's a fun concept but I don't I'd have to see it more in practice before I make a judgment on it.
2604000	2605000	Honestly.
2605000	2610000	This would have been perfect in like the college dorm where everybody had a video game system.
2610000	2611000	And you're going from like room to room.
2611000	2613000	That would have been great.
2613000	2618000	You know it would have been something like that would have been cool back in the the DVR edit days.
2618000	2620000	You know.
2620000	2622000	Let's see.
2622000	2624000	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.
2624000	2628000	Tigerclaw says so Sky is saying I don't care if you're autistic you're still a cheater.
2628000	2629000	Oh boy.
2629000	2631000	He's invoking a story which didn't make our show world tonight.
2631000	2632000	Maybe you've heard of it.
2632000	2639000	But Microsoft banned this kid and the mom was all over the media saying he's autistic and he's just really good at games.
2639000	2641000	And Microsoft's like no we caught him cheating.
2641000	2645000	He's banned from the network just like anybody else would be.
2645000	2647000	And turns out it came to light.
2647000	2653000	Yes he was doing that whole save file exploit thing where he could unlock achievements from opening up a save file.
2653000	2655000	And so yeah.
2655000	2657000	I don't care if you're autistic.
2657000	2660000	If you cheat you're a cheater and you should be dealt with appropriately.
2660000	2661000	I agree.
2661000	2663000	That has nothing to do with the end result.
2663000	2665000	Totally agree.
2665000	2671000	It doesn't matter the color of your skin, the sexuality, any type of handicap you might have.
2671000	2673000	Physical, mental.
2673000	2674000	Cheating is cheating.
2674000	2675000	Period.
2675000	2677000	You know what I mean.
2677000	2679000	It's just a little silly.
2679000	2684000	I like how, and this is all I'm going to say on it.
2684000	2697000	I like how when you know someone with a disability or you know some persecuted group will just come right out and say oh well you're doing it because of this this and this.
2697000	2702000	No you wanted to be treated like everybody else right?
2702000	2706000	How far do I want to go with this? How controversial do I want to be on the show?
2706000	2711000	There's a difference between actually singling somebody out and then treating somebody like everybody else.
2711000	2715000	Alright. Do you guys remember there was that burger joint in Town Town that was very popular.
2715000	2717000	It was all over the Food Network shows.
2717000	2727000	And they ended up getting sued by the American Disability Association or whatever because apparently the place was called the Squeeze In.
2727000	2733000	And it kind of made its whole little reputation off of being packed and crowded all of the time.
2733000	2738000	And some folks sued them based on disability needs and the damn place almost closed.
2738000	2740000	That's ridiculous.
2740000	2742000	And I kind of, I agree. And here's the thing.
2742000	2744000	Well technically it did close.
2744000	2746000	It did close and it had to reopen in a new location.
2746000	2754000	But they, and this is important to say, all you had to do was to honk your horn outside the restaurant and they would have served you whatever.
2754000	2757000	I mean they, you did not have to actually go into the restaurant.
2757000	2760000	So I don't think anyone was like totally being discriminated against or what have you.
2760000	2766000	You know? It just kind of struck me as, you know, ruining it for everyone. I don't know.
2766000	2768000	No, I agree.
2768000	2774000	It was a mess. But at the same time, that place never got more publicity than when that whole thing happened.
2774000	2776000	You know what I mean?
2776000	2778000	So, I don't care.
2778000	2781000	Alright. Let's see. Moving on to the chat room.
2781000	2785000	Spaznator in our chat room says, disability is no excuse to cheat.
2785000	2787000	I'm disabled myself and I refuse to cheat.
2787000	2792000	If I can do it just as good, if not better, at a game, I wear that fact as a badge of friggin' honor.
2792000	2795000	I agree. It's a good one.
2795000	2798000	I gotta read this comment from Derek H. Maybe lighten the mood a little bit too.
2798000	2801000	At our chatroom at chat.orangemantraded.com, Derek H says, confirmed.
2801000	2804000	Rob says, it's okay to cheat with friends.
2804000	2807000	I think a lot of bored housewives share the same philosophy.
2807000	2810000	So are you saying that the mailman is a friend?
2810000	2812000	I'm not sure quite what you're saying there.
2812000	2814000	Alright.
2814000	2816000	Well if you're fucking him, he is.
2816000	2818000	I think you know what I meant.
2818000	2822000	It's okay if you're a bored housewife cheating in...
2822000	2825000	What would bored housewives play? Final Fantasy XI?
2825000	2826000	Bunko.
2826000	2830000	Bunko. If you're all cheating in Bunko, you have...
2830000	2834000	Do they even have Bunko on Xbox Live Arcade or anything like that?
2834000	2835000	No.
2835000	2837000	That's a whole niche market they're missing out on.
2837000	2840000	If you have house rules for Bunko, then that's fine.
2840000	2842000	You know what I would actually compare it to?
2842000	2845000	And this is totally not what Derek meant by his comment, but too late.
2845000	2851000	You know in Monopoly, a lot of people say that every time you pay fines,
2851000	2853000	you're supposed to put it in the center of the board,
2853000	2856000	and if you land on free parking, you get the jackpot?
2856000	2857000	That's a house rule.
2857000	2860000	That's a house rule. That's not a rule. That's cheating.
2860000	2861000	You're cheating.
2861000	2865000	But you agree to house rules because it's kind of how you play with friends, right?
2865000	2868000	So, anyhow.
2868000	2870000	Let's move on.
2870000	2872000	More stories, Loki.
2872000	2879000	Okay, so this is kind of more about the whole firmware updates and whatnot.
2879000	2881000	It ties in to all that.
2881000	2888000	Sony, of course, was granted a temporary restraining order against GeoHot.
2888000	2896000	Basically preventing him from offering to the public, creating, posting online,
2896000	2899000	marketing, advertising, promoting, installing, distributing, providing,
2899000	2906000	or otherwise trafficking in any software or methods for circumventing PS3 protection methods.
2906000	2912000	No longer can he provide links from any websites to any other websites relating to such matters
2912000	2916000	or publish any information obtained by hacking the PS3,
2916000	2922000	and more to the point, he can no longer engage in acts of circumvention of the TPMS
2922000	2929000	in the PS3 system to access, obtain, remove, or traffic in copyrighted works.
2929000	2932000	Which I don't think he was doing anyways.
2932000	2940000	And then, of course, there's still issues about the whole jurisdiction issues
2940000	2943000	since, of course, he resides in a different state than Sony
2943000	2946000	and a different state from where the claim was filed.
2946000	2953000	And they're saying that because he purposefully directed his activities at the forum state of California,
2953000	2955000	they're letting it go through.
2955000	2960000	So that's kind of, that's not a good precedent to be setting by the courts,
2960000	2967000	saying, oh, well, because you conducted yourself on a website that was located in California,
2967000	2969000	we can try you in California.
2969000	2976000	So, you know, anybody who uses Facebook or Twitter or whatever can be tried in California,
2976000	2978000	no matter where you are in the world, I guess.
2978000	2980000	I find this comment from our chatroom interesting.
2980000	2982000	I have to ask Loki about it here.
2982000	2983000	It's from Napreos.
2983000	2984000	I finally figured out how to pronounce the name.
2984000	2986000	Napreos says, F-G-O-HOT.
2986000	2988000	He deserves it, cocky bastard.
2988000	2991000	Now, I haven't really seen this guy in action.
2991000	2995000	I realize he's been in the media and so forth, but is that, like, a legitimate claim?
2995000	2996000	Is he really cocky?
2996000	2997000	Like, did he kind of have it coming to him?
2997000	3004000	I don't know if he's cocky, but it all comes down to, I mean, this is just part of the discovery phase of the whole trial.
3004000	3008000	It's not like Sony is getting his equipment.
3008000	3015000	I mean, they'll have access to it along with the lawyers, you know, to kind of make sure no funny business is going on,
3015000	3019000	but it's not like this stuff gets shipped to Sony.
3019000	3023000	And even still, it doesn't even really matter.
3023000	3031000	Like I said, this whole trial isn't necessarily about, you know, what GeoHot's doing, because there's plenty of other people.
3031000	3034000	I mean, all he did was post the keys.
3034000	3036000	He didn't create the custom firmwares that are out there.
3036000	3040000	He didn't, you know, create the abilities to play backup games.
3040000	3042000	That was other people.
3042000	3050000	And they've actually gone and they've been doing cease and desists on different websites, hosting files and whatnot,
3050000	3057000	but now people have kind of diverted that stuff to a file hosting place off-sea, you know, in other countries.
3057000	3059000	So they can't be touched, I guess.
3059000	3061000	Let me play devil's advocate here for a minute.
3061000	3072000	Not that I necessarily feel this way, but wouldn't that sort of be the equivalent of you shut down a file sharing site such as Pirate Bay or whatever,
3072000	3077000	because they're enabling people to facilitate illegal downloads.
3077000	3082000	They're not posting the illegal downloads themselves, but because they facilitate it, they're the ones that get in trouble.
3082000	3090000	I would say that would make sense if you're basically... if he was releasing the backup creator for it.
3090000	3094000	Yes, this could be used for legitimate backups, but some people might not use it for that.
3094000	3096000	That's not what he's doing at all.
3096000	3109000	This is basically saying, I guess it would be the equivalent of a car salesman handing you the keys to a car and you go hit someone with that car.
3109000	3114000	They're enabling you to get in that car and murder someone with that car, so they should be held liable for it.
3114000	3117000	That's basically what the equivalent of it is.
3117000	3120000	Dealerships actually do have liability against that type of thing.
3120000	3127000	But it's retarded. I understand that they may get away with that in the laws in the United States because it's absolutely retarded,
3127000	3130000	but people can sue and win for hot coffee.
3130000	3143000	Granted, he posted stuff, keys, and I'm sure that they don't want people obviously giving them backdoor access to the entire PS3,
3143000	3152000	but what he's done, yes, may eventually lead to piracy or easier piracy on PlayStation 3,
3152000	3161000	because these tools allow people to run unsigned code and people can create unsigned programs for piracy purposes,
3161000	3164000	but also they can create code for other things.
3164000	3173000	So it's not necessarily that he's directly responsible for it, but yes, he plays a part of that, I guess.
3173000	3179000	But once again, this court case isn't about necessarily him hacking stuff.
3179000	3182000	It's about whether you own that console that you purchased.
3182000	3186000	I was going to say, and this is a great comment from Bob Coffey in our chat room here,
3186000	3191000	Hackers aren't cheaters. The trial isn't about hacking. The trial is about your rights as a consumer,
3191000	3195000	not about CFW or any shit at that. The real precedent this may set is,
3195000	3201000	do you own the computing product you buy, or is it a licensed product?
3201000	3204000	Interesting note to end it on. I guess we'll see what develops with this.
3204000	3210000	Any rumors about, or any rumbling about any pushback, appeals, things of that nature? What happens next?
3210000	3214000	Well, they've already filed an appeal to have the whole case, you know, dismissed,
3214000	3219000	but I don't think, it doesn't sound like that the judge is going for that.
3219000	3226000	So at this point, I don't know, it's going to be tough to prove that he did all this stuff, or he's actually doing it.
3226000	3229000	The problem is that somebody's claiming all these things that obviously aren't true.
3229000	3234000	Like they're saying, oh yes, he's pirating stuff, or he's enabled it for people to pirate stuff.
3234000	3239000	When they initially made that statement, that was not the case.
3239000	3245000	Now it may be the case, because now there's the ability to do that, but it wasn't anything he did.
3245000	3257000	So, I don't know, it's difficult to, it all depends on how intelligent the court, the judges and stuff like that,
3257000	3262000	and whether she's going to buy into this retarded nonsense.
3262000	3266000	Alright, well we will see what develops. I'm sure we have not said the last on this,
3266000	3273000	so let's go ahead and move on to some release dates, and travel the world and see what is coming out in a video game store near you this week.
3273000	3281000	Not a whole lot this week actually, it's pretty sad, but there will be some better stuff in the upcoming month.
3281000	3285000	This week, they've got a track pack for Rock Band.
3285000	3295000	If you're missing out on some country music, there's a second country track pack coming out this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3295000	3306000	Let's see, some other smaller games, Junior Brain Trainer 2 is making its way out on DS.
3306000	3314000	The Sims 3 Outdoor Living, it's kind of an expansion pack for The Sims 3, that's coming out on PC.
3314000	3320000	That's funny. On PC they have a game called The Ball.
3320000	3324000	Apparently someone took my advice and made a game about ball.
3324000	3327000	Wow!
3327000	3331000	That is coming out on PC.
3331000	3340000	And then of course, a week from today, sort of, Mario Sports Mix will be out on the Wii.
3340000	3342000	That's it?
3342000	3343000	Yeah.
3343000	3344000	Wow.
3344000	3346000	It's a really, really dead week.
3346000	3349000	Is there a reason for that? Is that just because of the 3DS?
3349000	3354000	Not yet into the middle of February. February is a pretty light month.
3354000	3358000	I mean, it's more games than there would be in January, but it's not March.
3358000	3363000	Alright. Well, let's move on and look at Japan and what they've got coming out.
3363000	3366000	I gotta tell you, it's kind of the same thing. They don't have a whole lot coming out.
3366000	3371000	There's a couple things to note. Dodonpachi Daifukutsu Black Label comes out.
3371000	3374000	That's a cave shooter coming out on the Xbox 360.
3374000	3385000	That is coming out on February the 3rd because they get a lot of those shooters over there where it's just pretty much that little center of the screen getting taken up with a shooter.
3385000	3388000	But quite an audience for the shmups over here too.
3388000	3390000	So you can check that out.
3390000	3396000	Also, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 gets its localized edition on the Xbox 360 this week.
3396000	3400000	That is also coming out on the PlayStation 3 and that's the only PS3 release this week in Japan.
3400000	3404000	Going to the Nintendo Wii real quick.
3404000	3405000	Nothing.
3405000	3412000	Things are dying down on the Nintendo front, of course, because of the 3DS's impending release on February 26th over there.
3412000	3415000	Although the Nintendo DS does have a couple things to note.
3415000	3420000	Dragon Ball Ultimate Butou 2 Den comes out this week from Namco Bandai.
3420000	3424000	Also, Gyakuten Kenji 2 comes out this week.
3424000	3428000	That is in a regular and a limited edition. It's coming out from Capcom.
3428000	3432000	I believe that is a Phoenix Wright spinoff game.
3432000	3435000	That comes out this week.
3435000	3438000	It definitely has some of the same characters in that series.
3438000	3448000	I think this looks to be a little more like walking around adventure-y type of game, but I'm sure still the whole courtroom scenes and objections that you know and love.
3448000	3450000	Moving on quickly to the PSP.
3450000	3453000	There's a release on there that some folks might be interested in.
3453000	3457000	White Knight Chronicles Episode Portable Dogma Wars comes out this week.
3457000	3461000	That's an official Sony product from Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan this week.
3461000	3465000	It'll be interesting to see what they improved on in the PS3 version, if anything.
3465000	3469000	Also on the PSP, Macross Triangle Frontier.
3469000	3471000	And that does it for your Japanese releases.
3471000	3473000	Wait, that's the Macross Frontier game?
3473000	3475000	Yeah, Macross Triangle Frontier.
3475000	3477000	Let me see, because Macross Frontier is the...
3477000	3479000	Yeah, that's for the new one that came out.
3479000	3481000	The new series it was out.
3481000	3485000	Which Dan and I watched all the way through. It's really good.
3485000	3487000	So this looks really cool.
3487000	3489000	Looks kind of like a 3D shooter game.
3489000	3493000	Not like a typical shmup. More of like a polygon-y shmup game.
3493000	3501000	We're big fans of the Macross games. I bet it's a lot like the VFR games.
3501000	3507000	Actually, we've got Macross M3 for Dreamcast, which is a really good game.
3507000	3509000	So yeah, I love the Macross games.
3509000	3511000	Was that Japan?
3511000	3513000	That's it for Japan.
3513000	3523000	In the UK, February 2nd, we have Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3523000	3525000	We have long cookies.
3525000	3529000	On the 4th, we have Earthrise, Lord of Arcana.
3529000	3533000	Mario vs. Donkey Kong Mini Land Mayhem. Nailed.
3533000	3539000	Sega Mega Drive Classics Volume 4 and Two Worlds 2.
3539000	3541000	That's it.
3541000	3545000	Let's move on with some more stories.
3545000	3547000	And the Classic Game of the Week is just ahead.
3547000	3549000	I don't know what's more ridiculous.
3549000	3554000	The whole lawsuit that this company is facing or the name of this game.
3554000	3559000	But Facebook game Blingville is getting the cease and desist from Zynga.
3559000	3565000	Apparently Zynga believes that they own the rights to the use of Ville in any product.
3565000	3567000	I guess it's out there.
3567000	3571000	Gosh, what are you, the new monster cables? Seriously.
3571000	3576000	I'm going to start suing everybody for using Ville or Doodle or Monster.
3576000	3581000	But apparently, they have a...
3581000	3585000	Send a cease and desist to Blingville LLC.
3585000	3588000	A unique company name, I suppose.
3588000	3592000	The creators of the Facebook game, of course, has the same name.
3592000	3601000	According to Zynga, the use of Ville in the game and the company's moniker infringes on its own collection of social gaming trademarks.
3601000	3617000	Blingville, of course, associated with Zynga in any way, has filed a letter to the West Virginia US District Court seeking a declaration from the court that the game does not actually infringe on Zynga's trademarks.
3617000	3623000	The studio also hopes to have Zynga foot the bill for any legal fees potentially accrued during the legal battle.
3623000	3631000	And I guess right now, it's just a matter of time to see what happens.
3631000	3638000	I love Breslull's comment in our chat room. Cruella de Vil? Will they be suing Disney?
3638000	3641000	I think that's possible.
3641000	3643000	Come on, Zynga.
3643000	3649000	I kind of find it to be a taste of their own medicine a little bit. Wasn't Farmville like a rip-off of Farm Town? Which of those two came first?
3649000	3650000	It was Farm Town.
3650000	3653000	Ah, so, I mean, come on, Zynga.
3653000	3658000	Whatever. Zynga's, like, evil, okay? And that's all it comes down to.
3658000	3664000	People hate Zynga. Like, they don't have any original content. It's just ripped off from stuff.
3664000	3675000	And now they're suing people out of the way because they may come in and start taking away some of the money that Farmville or Cityville or, I don't know, whatever.
3675000	3682000	Just because you have names of stuff that end with a Ville does not mean all of a sudden you own the trademark to Ville.
3682000	3683000	They're gonna sue Danville next.
3683000	3689000	I think the people that made Farm Town should sue them because they started farm games, honestly.
3689000	3691000	If that lawsuit didn't already happen.
3691000	3696000	Yeah, I'm looking at Wikipedia. I mean, I know it's not a definitive resource, but it's a pretty good place to start researching.
3696000	3703000	And I do notice it says Farmville started as a clone of the popular Farm Town, which also featured on Facebook in June 2009.
3703000	3705000	And there are some citations for that.
3705000	3710000	What's the other big Zynga game? Isn't Yeoville another big one? Do they even have that?
3710000	3715000	I don't know. Let me see. I thought that's what it was called. I don't see an article on that.
3715000	3718000	What are the other big Zynga games out there? I wanna know if they were not those two.
3718000	3719000	Texas Hold'em.
3719000	3720000	Really?
3720000	3721000	Dan plays that.
3721000	3727000	Ugh. Um. Let's see. I'm trying to see if they have like a list of games somewhere here. Oh, here we go.
3727000	3730000	Mafia Wars. Wasn't that a knockoff of a game, too?
3734000	3736000	I know this is a very exciting radio. Yeah.
3736000	3744000	The makers of a similar online game, Mob Wars, sued Zynga over the launch of Mafia Wars, accusing them of copyright infringement.
3744000	3746000	Frontierville. That's the other big one, too.
3746000	3752000	That's the one I always see on my stupid wall. I don't think that was necessarily a ripoff of anything, though.
3752000	3754000	Interesting.
3754000	3756000	Alright.
3756000	3759000	I just think all of thoseville games are a waste of time.
3759000	3764000	You know, I would sit here and criticize it, but then, again, I can't stop playing that stupid Knights of the Clicky.
3764000	3769000	Or, what is it really called? Knights of the Crystal is the real name of the game.
3769000	3774000	That Square Enix one. Can't stop playing it. It's the dumbest game ever, but I just keep clickin'.
3774000	3780000	Click, click, click. Keep doing quests. The artwork's really good, at least. I can say that. Get away with that.
3780000	3787000	Alright, here's a more respectable game I'm getting excited about. Portal 2. Of course, Portal 2 is coming out soon.
3787000	3792000	I guess that's really a relative term, but it's coming out within the next few months.
3792000	3797000	Portal 2 is going to be coming out, of course, on the PC and the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
3797000	3802000	But we had some news, of course, last week about how PlayStation 3 is supposed to be the definitive version.
3802000	3807000	Well, there's going to be a lot of cool stuff on the PC version as well, including mod tools.
3807000	3810000	You know, what is a Valve game that doesn't have some mod tools available for it?
3810000	3814000	And some mod tools will be available on the PC version of Portal 2.
3814000	3821000	Unfortunately, that content is not going to be available on the 360 or the PS3, meaning the mod tools.
3821000	3827000	However, what they're saying, and this is a quote from Chet Felizic, who is from Valve, saying,
3827000	3832000	The content that comes out is agnostic, and so we will be seeing that on all platforms.
3832000	3836000	Depending on the platform you're on, I should say, will depend on how we're delivering it.
3836000	3842000	Meaning that, you know, the content that you make, it could come out on the PS3 or it could come out on the 360.
3842000	3846000	Perhaps it's some type of download content, maybe a best of on the PC.
3846000	3853000	But if you are really into the user content, then maybe you ought to think about that when you decide which system you're going to purchase the game on.
3853000	3863000	By the way, they are also saying that each of the game's two campaign modes will have individual surprise rewards when you beat them.
3863000	3866000	So single player has one reward, co-op has another.
3866000	3871000	There are two sets of credits and two sets of endings. Interesting.
3871000	3876000	So if you really want to get the full game, you're going to have to play single and you're going to have to play co-op.
3876000	3878000	That should be very interesting.
3878000	3887000	So there you go, Portal 2 coming out whenever Valve's ready. I know there's a release date out there somewhere, but I refuse to believe anything final until the game is actually out on shelves.
3887000	3891000	If you need something to play in the meantime, how about the classic game of the week?
3891000	3899000	It's a chance for DarkSakura to dive into the gaming vault and pick a game that she thinks, hey, you kids ought to be playing this.
3899000	3901000	This is a true classic game.
3901000	3907000	And instead of all this newfangled Farmville crap, and I mean crap...
3907000	3909000	Get off my lawn.
3909000	3911000	Go play this game instead and get off my lawn.
3911000	3913000	Alright, what is the classic game of the week?
3913000	3914000	Pull up your pants.
3914000	3916000	What is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
3916000	3919000	I think that the chat room will be able to tell the moment the music plays.
3919000	3922000	Well then, let me pull up the little music here and...
3922000	3928000	And whoever guesses first in the chat room, I'm looking, gets a no prize.
3928000	3935000	Alright, I'm looking at you, chat room.
3935000	3940000	They're on to like a minute delay, so you might want to see it for a little bit.
3940000	3946000	Okay. Well, it is Final Fantasy VI, or as we got it over here, Final Fantasy III.
3946000	3951000	And it is one of my all-time favorite games because of this music.
3951000	3954000	This music is epic. It makes me want to climb a mountain.
3954000	3958000	It had a great, great, great story.
3958000	3966000	It had really amazing classic scenes, like the Opera House, which of course everyone knows.
3966000	3974000	This whole music plays when they're in their little machine walker things.
3974000	3977000	And Bojikawa gets the no prize, by the way.
3977000	3979000	It was just amazing.
3979000	3990000	This game came out in 1994 in Japan, and then it came out in 1999 on the PlayStation.
3990000	3995000	It was amazing, like I've said a bunch of times.
3995000	4001000	It's actually sort of based about the second industrial revolution,
4001000	4004000	meaning that it's got the sort of technical aspects into the game.
4004000	4009000	Character designs were done by Yoshitaka Amano,
4009000	4017000	and he did pretty much everything with that game as far as the character designs and whatnot.
4017000	4022000	Well, actually also he and Yoshinori Kitase,
4022000	4031000	and then of course the composer for the music was Nobuo Uematsu, so it was really good.
4031000	4035000	It had random encounters, and you had chocobos in your airship,
4035000	4038000	and it was just everything that one expects to be in a Final Fantasy game.
4038000	4043000	You had an active time battle system, you had four players per party,
4043000	4048000	and you could also change your main person walking around, I think by hitting one of the shoulder buttons.
4048000	4055000	You had your thief, you had the runic ability, which was absorbing magic attacks until the next turn.
4055000	4057000	That was Selle's.
4057000	4060000	All kinds of different stuff.
4060000	4067000	Then you had your special hidden characters like Gao, who was the monster mimic.
4067000	4074000	And you had a Moogle, who...
4074000	4076000	Why can't I remember the Moogle's name?
4076000	4078000	Anyway, Mog, yes, thank you, it was Mog.
4078000	4081000	Because Mog house.
4081000	4086000	But anyway, he had dances, which was always really fun.
4086000	4090000	Dude, it was all about Realm, who had the drawing attack.
4090000	4093000	That was really sick.
4093000	4096000	So yeah, it had all kinds of neat stuff.
4096000	4101000	It's very steampunky in ways too, combining technology and magic.
4101000	4109000	And it had the most insane bad guy ever, Kefka, who just had this funny, funny laugh.
4109000	4111000	And...
4111000	4113000	I know, right?
4113000	4115000	Oh, and don't forget, the man.
4115000	4118000	If you can find the music rub, you should play it. Shadow.
4118000	4120000	If I can find it.
4120000	4125000	Because he was freaking amazing.
4125000	4132000	But yeah, it actually had alterations made in some of the character sprites.
4132000	4141000	For example, there was this one character who you could see her naked butt, and they covered her butt up.
4141000	4148000	You know, some of the item names were changed here and there, especially for the PlayStation release.
4148000	4151000	Yo, you found it.
4151000	4154000	This is also the good music of the game.
4154000	4156000	Turn it up a little bit wrong.
4162000	4164000	What did you say?
4164000	4168000	Dan said he would slit his mama's throat for...
4168000	4171000	I know, but I forgot the line.
4171000	4175000	Wasn't Shadow, like, wasn't the whole thing that Shadow's a chick?
4175000	4176000	No.
4176000	4179000	I thought, isn't Shadow supposed to be, like, Realm's mom or something?
4179000	4182000	Realm's father. Oh, okay.
4182000	4183000	Hinted app, but never confirmed.
4183000	4185000	Dan's talking off mic.
4185000	4188000	That'll be confirmed in Final Fantasy VI, too.
4188000	4190000	When Square gets around to making that.
4190000	4199000	But, I mean, and keep in mind, you know, they used the characters from this for doing the Nintendo 64 demo, remember?
4199000	4203000	When they were gonna put Final Fantasy VII on the Nintendo 64.
4203000	4207000	Which the demo is kinda weird looking, but it was neat at the same time.
4207000	4209000	But this was seriously...
4209000	4212000	I think it has to be one of the highlights of the series.
4212000	4214000	Definitely one of the highlights of the series.
4214000	4221000	And there's also discussion about it being remade for the 3DS. I think that's pretty cool.
4221000	4222000	That'd be neat.
4222000	4223000	Yeah.
4223000	4226000	But, yeah. There we go.
4226000	4231000	There it is, folks. Your classic game of the week, Final Fantasy VI.
4231000	4234000	Or as you might call it, it's so good it's Final Fantasy sex.
4234000	4235000	I don't know. It's up to you.
4235000	4238000	Alright, that's gonna do it for Part A tonight of Orange Lounge Radio.
4238000	4240000	But don't go anywhere, guys. We're not done with the show yet.
4240000	4243000	Part B is coming up. We have more news for you guys.
4243000	4246000	We're gonna talk about an interesting funding program for independent video games.
4246000	4247000	We'll get into that.
4247000	4252000	Some clarity on the next wave of 3DS games, including Kid Icarus and some other things.
4252000	4256000	Some developments in that whole Sarian.net thing.
4256000	4258000	Remember how you could play like King's Quest on your iPad?
4258000	4259000	We have some updates on that.
4259000	4262000	We're gonna get into all that in Part B as well as your Twitter topics.
4262000	4264000	So get them in at OLR on Twitter.
4264000	4275000	Your emails and much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4275000	4278000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4278000	4285000	We are live on this Sunday, January the 30th of 2011 for the 399th episode of our show.
4285000	4287000	That's right. We hit a little bit of a milestone next week.
4287000	4290000	And then I get to start saying four a lot.
4290000	4292000	No plans of ending anytime soon.
4292000	4298000	We'll still be here until, I don't know, one of us is hospitalized for a long time or something.
4298000	4301000	I shouldn't say something like that. God, I hope nothing like that ever happens.
4301000	4304000	Anyhow, meanwhile, we also have side projects.
4304000	4308000	Like this thing's been going on so long that now everybody wants to do their side project.
4308000	4309000	Not everyone.
4309000	4313000	Not everyone. Well, Loki, your baby is your side project. That's kind of...
4313000	4314000	18 years worth of side projects.
4314000	4316000	Even if it wasn't.
4316000	4323000	That's right. Josh, the... I don't know. I would love to hear Nellie do a podcast about video games because she kind of hates them all.
4323000	4325000	Well, she's like, I have to always stay here and watch the baby.
4325000	4327000	I was like, well, you can go do the show. I'll stay here and watch the baby.
4327000	4329000	I was like, okay.
4329000	4332000	That would be fun. I think on April Fool's Day, you should send Nellie over.
4332000	4334000	We'll make her read stories and everything.
4334000	4337000	She'll be like, I don't even know what this says. This is just words.
4337000	4339000	What is this? You guys, what is this?
4339000	4341000	You guys care about this stuff?
4341000	4342000	She's welcome to bring Josh over.
4342000	4343000	That's right, yeah.
4343000	4346000	And then I'll watch the baby and she can read my stories.
4346000	4348000	He's sick right now. He can't come over.
4348000	4351000	All right. Anyhow.
4351000	4355000	Other things to talk about that's going on. Spinoff shows, sideshows.
4355000	4359000	Dark Sakura does a comic book one every week. Tell us about it.
4359000	4361000	It's called Comic Insanity.
4361000	4367000	And we basically just talk about, you know, what's coming out this week, every Wednesday.
4367000	4370000	And the show goes up on Tuesday, ideally.
4370000	4373000	And, you know, we talk about what we're reading, what we're looking forward to.
4373000	4375000	We all have a pick that all three of us are going to read.
4375000	4378000	And then we also review different things that we've read.
4378000	4387000	Like, for example, we all just read, excuse me, IDW's Infestation.
4387000	4389000	I think it was Infestation. Yeah.
4389000	4395000	Which, you know, we all gave our reviews on it. I hated it.
4395000	4397000	And, you know, talked about other comics that we read.
4397000	4402000	Next week, if you want to hear our review on a comic called Witchfinder,
4402000	4405000	then we will be reviewing that one next week.
4405000	4411000	We also have an app for Android, so you can listen to episodes and tweet us.
4411000	4413000	We have our iPhone app coming soon.
4413000	4415000	Want to know our app for Android? What the hey?
4415000	4417000	I'm working on this.
4417000	4419000	All right. I want to know more about this.
4419000	4421000	But I just found out about it.
4421000	4423000	Okay. That's fine.
4423000	4427000	So, yeah. And you can find us on Infamous.net and F-A-M-O-U-S.net.
4427000	4429000	Awesome.
4429000	4433000	Hoard House. The best little Hoard House in Azeroth if you want more Warcraft talk.
4433000	4435000	And how could you possibly want more after this show?
4435000	4440000	No, there's a whole show I have with my pal Xtaphir that we talk about Warcraft.
4440000	4442000	Didn't have a show this week, so I can't tell you what was going on.
4442000	4445000	Xtaphir had an emergency he had to deal with, so we didn't have a show this week.
4445000	4449000	But we are going to be back next week talking about, you know,
4449000	4451000	what's going on in the world of Warcraft.
4451000	4455000	And there's a new patch on the horizon that's likely to drop this week,
4455000	4459000	so I'm sure there's going to be a lot of talk about some of the changes they make this week.
4459000	4461000	They already put up a patch, didn't they?
4461000	4463000	Well, they patch that game all the time.
4463000	4467000	Oh, no, because I upgraded to Cataclysm and that's when mine patched.
4467000	4469000	Got it. Yeah, that's the patch you're thinking of.
4469000	4473000	But there is a new, it's the post-Cataclysm patch that fixes some of the problems.
4473000	4475000	That fixed the arcane?
4475000	4477000	Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'd go that far.
4477000	4480000	But we'll be talking about some of that next week on the show.
4480000	4486000	Also, Bresloul would slap me in the face if I did not mention what's going on with
4486000	4488000	U.S.L. Madness.
4488000	4492000	Understation Live's little tournament that they do where they try to find the best
4492000	4495000	video game of all time, time, time, time, time.
4495000	4498000	Vote now. All the links are in our forums at
4498000	4500000	orangesloudestrader.com. Check the U.S.L. Madness forum.
4500000	4503000	Which we know what's going to win, and I know it's not on any of the lists,
4503000	4505000	but it's going to be a write-in winner.
4505000	4507000	You watch Barbie Horse Adventures.
4507000	4509000	It's going to be a dark horse.
4509000	4514000	I'm not, literally, I'm not sure that there's a write-in thing you can do after
4514000	4517000	the beginning, but if there's a way to hack it, Loki will.
4517000	4521000	Loki will hack the results of U.S.L. Madness. Just watch.
4521000	4523000	They'll all be Barbie Horse Adventure.
4523000	4525000	It'll all be Barbie Horse Adventure.
4525000	4529000	And then I have to say this. Bobby, the gentleman who does the show before us,
4529000	4531000	the Bobby Black Wolf show, it's fantastic.
4531000	4534000	Live at All Games Radio. Look it up on iTunes. Subscribe.
4534000	4538000	He mentioned on his show tonight, he was reviewing the game Two Worlds 2,
4538000	4540000	and he talked for a long time about this game.
4540000	4542000	I haven't even touched the game yet.
4542000	4545000	The first one was so bad, from what I heard, that I had no interest in the
4545000	4548000	second one, but apparently the second one fixes a lot of problems.
4548000	4551000	There's a lot of funny references in it, and one of the screenshots she sent us
4551000	4555000	is a character saying, or you can choose between an option, saying,
4555000	4558000	I'll do it, and, well, I'm pleased to inform you that you can now ask
4558000	4561000	Mr. Mirage to die in a fire. That's right.
4561000	4564000	The die in a fire reference has made it into a video game.
4564000	4566000	There you go.
4566000	4569000	If you said die in a boat fire, then we know that they were listening to OLR,
4569000	4571000	because I don't think you hear that expression anywhere else.
4571000	4574000	But if you have never heard die in a boat fire before, Dark Soccer's eating,
4574000	4576000	so I'll have to explain it to you.
4576000	4578000	Oh, Dark Soccer's gonna chew, chew, chew.
4578000	4579000	Okay.
4579000	4580000	Okay, die in a boat fire.
4580000	4581000	Sorry, I'm eating unagi.
4581000	4583000	Why would you tell someone to die in a boat fire?
4583000	4587000	Because you'd either drown to death because you couldn't get back in the boat
4587000	4592000	because it was on fire, or you would burn to death out of fear of drowning.
4592000	4594000	There you go.
4594000	4597000	I think it should actually be an oil tanker fire.
4597000	4601000	Because then the water will be on fire, too.
4601000	4604000	That's the worst kind of fire. It's like, how do I put it out?
4604000	4606000	The water's on fire.
4606000	4607000	Exactly.
4607000	4608000	It's just more fire.
4608000	4611000	Wow. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.
4611000	4613000	We gotta get to some rapid news, a lot of quick stories.
4613000	4616000	We have a lot tonight between Logie and myself doing some quick news tonight.
4616000	4618000	Logie?
4618000	4625000	Yes, two great games from my childhood coming back on Facebook.
4625000	4628000	You know, I think it's awesome.
4628000	4632000	Oregon Trail and Carmen Sandiego are coming back.
4632000	4634000	They're making their return.
4634000	4637000	Of course, getting a little bit of a facelift as well.
4637000	4643000	I believe the Oregon Trail one is actually the one that's been on the phones for a while now.
4643000	4647000	Judging by the screenshots, it kind of resembles that.
4647000	4653000	I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate, but who cares?
4653000	4656000	It's awesome. Carmen Sandiego and Oregon Trail.
4656000	4659000	Seriously, kids need to grow up on that.
4659000	4666000	That should be required PC game playing as part of your curriculum in grade school.
4666000	4670000	And I hope to hell, I hope to hell this song is in it.
4670000	4679000	Because if they don't have this song in it, then seriously, fuck this game.
4679000	4685000	What about an alternative rock edition of that song?
4685000	4689000	I might be okay with that. Like a death metal version of this.
4689000	4694000	Tell me where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.
4694000	4701000	Gwar, now doing the theme to where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.
4701000	4703000	Oh, she's in my pants.
4703000	4706000	But yeah, that's going to be coming out very soon.
4706000	4710000	February 2nd, the Oregon Trail will be coming.
4710000	4714000	And then February 9th, very next week, Carmen Sandiego.
4714000	4717000	So that's pretty awesome.
4717000	4722000	So Rob, are you going to be playing these on Facebook?
4722000	4725000	I'll at least check them out at least once.
4725000	4729000	You know you have to try at least the Carmen Sandiego one, so I can post to my wall.
4729000	4735000	Rob has found Carmen Sandiego. She was under the mattress the whole time.
4735000	4737000	Click here to find her.
4737000	4747000	It's annoying because we had these giant posters in our computer lab with different country flags and stuff like that.
4747000	4752000	You have to know geography and stuff like that. I don't know geography. I'm good at the Oregon Trail.
4752000	4755000	I can shoot animals. That's fine.
4755000	4763000	I was always super good at where in time was Carmen Sandiego because I am a big history nerd.
4763000	4765000	I have been since I was a little kid.
4765000	4768000	You're just a big nerd, and you have been since you were a little kid.
4768000	4769000	Yeah, I am.
4769000	4771000	And that's why we love you.
4771000	4777000	I was going to say, the Oregon Trail, you know in this one, if it's not already out, in this one, you will be able to pick your friends,
4777000	4783000	like literally from your friends list that will go on the Oregon Trail with you, so I can post to your wall like,
4783000	4789000	Hi, Jamie. You just, Jamie, insert real last name here, you just died of dysentery on Rob's Oregon Trail.
4789000	4791000	Click here to find the cure.
4791000	4793000	I'm so going to play that.
4793000	4796000	It's called modern medicine.
4796000	4800000	Here, drink this. We don't know what's in it, but the snake oil lady said it would help.
4800000	4805000	Why can't we get like further expansions to the Oregon Trail like, you know, zombies.
4805000	4807000	Zombies have attacked your party.
4807000	4810000	Oregon Trail 2. Fuck it, we're going back.
4813000	4817000	Wagons East. Sorry, Chris Farley.
4817000	4821000	Or no, not Chris Farley, I'm sorry, that's even before Chris Farley.
4821000	4823000	That's John Candy.
4823000	4826000	That was Canadian Bacon was the other one, remember that?
4826000	4828000	Invading Canada.
4828000	4830000	Alright, anyhow.
4833000	4837000	So the Japanese folks are getting their hands on Scribblenauts,
4837000	4846000	and they're also getting their hands on a few additional characters and objects added in thanks to a translation from Konami.
4846000	4855000	The Japanese version will feature some wonderful Konami staples, including Old Snake from Metal Gear Solid 4,
4855000	4861000	Gradis' Vic Viper, and Love Plus' Manaka Tanake.
4861000	4863000	And where is Twinbee?
4863000	4865000	Where, may I ask, is Twinbee?
4865000	4869000	I don't know, well these are just the screenshots that were posted.
4869000	4872000	Maybe there are more things in there, maybe people haven't tried Twinbee.
4872000	4874000	Okay, alright, fair enough.
4874000	4876000	DDR machine.
4877000	4882000	That's kind of cool though, since a different company kind of works with it in another country,
4882000	4884000	it gets some extra easter eggs, it's kind of cool.
4884000	4890000	It's also rumored that if you type in failure, a version of Rock Revolution appears.
4892000	4895000	Miserable failure. Oh, it's a copy of Rock Revolution.
4898000	4909000	Thanks to a financial quarterly report from Nintendo, a new Kirby sequel is coming from the developer HAL,
4909000	4918000	and they have a teaser actually for it, and apparently it looks like a 3D Kirby game, just not all yarny.
4918000	4924000	So it is going to be a more traditional Kirby game, but still pretty cool looking.
4924000	4927000	Now with less yarn and more sucking.
4927000	4928000	Yes.
4928000	4930000	But that's a good thing, when you're talking about Kirby.
4930000	4935000	Pokémon Black and White are actually getting some PC connectivity.
4935000	4944000	Apparently using, of course they also have the Pokéwalker peripheral, which was from Heart and Gold,
4944000	4950000	but that won't be used in Black and White at all, but they're going to have the Pokémon Global Link.
4950000	4954000	It's a website launching this spring, I guess shortly after the game is released,
4954000	4960000	which allows players to sync their save files to an online profile, giving them an access to a wide range of tools,
4960000	4971000	including to network with fellow trainers, also check their battle statistics, assigning them worldwide rankings,
4971000	4977000	and granting them eligibility to participate in live regional, national, and global tournaments.
4977000	4983000	And it says the site will host mini-games which let players collect Pokémon items,
4983000	4986000	which they can transfer back to their cartridges as well,
4986000	4996000	and also let them sync a monster from their games to the website and explore their dreams online.
4996000	4998000	Nerds.
4998000	5000000	Interesting.
5000000	5006000	And then, let's see, last but not least, Rock Band, of course having more stuff coming out this week.
5006000	5011000	This week is actually going to be The Clash and their London Calling album.
5011000	5017000	You can buy the whole album for $20, or you can buy each individual track for $2 each,
5017000	5023000	or whatever in your preferred console's space bucks.
5023000	5031000	It includes the tracks London Calling, Brand New Cadillac, Jimmy Jazz, Hateful, Rudy Can't Fail,
5031000	5037000	Spanish Bombs to the Right Profile, Lost in the Supermarket, Clamp Down, The Guns of Brixton,
5037000	5046000	Rong M. Boyo, Death and Glory, Coca-Cola, the card sheet, Lever's Rock, Four Horsemen,
5046000	5049000	I'm Not Down, and Revolution Rock.
5049000	5059000	And of course, for what looks like London Calling, Rudy Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, Clamp Down,
5059000	5065000	and the card sheet, they do have the Pro Guitar and Bass expansions available for an additional dollar
5065000	5069000	if you're feeling like that.
5069000	5074000	So, look forward to that this week.
5074000	5081000	Alright, moving on to some other stories, and we're going to start off with some news on Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5081000	5087000	God, they have done such a good job keeping this game relevant, because they let a little bit of news out
5087000	5090000	every week about some new characters that are in the game, so pretty cool.
5090000	5096000	Cienco and Sentinel have been confirmed as characters that will be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3,
5096000	5099000	which is kind of funny, because I thought they had come out and said,
5099000	5103000	no more Darkstalkers players, but yet it was a lie.
5103000	5105000	So, yep, there it is.
5105000	5107000	That'll be fun. I don't know.
5107000	5111000	Cienco's pretty cool. I remember I used Cienco all the time in Puzzle Fighter.
5111000	5116000	Or, she had a different name, I thought.
5116000	5118000	No, in Puzzle Fighter.
5118000	5121000	Cienco's lay-light intercession was Mei Mei.
5121000	5126000	Ah, what about Sentinel? Are you excited about these characters coming to MVC 3, Dark Sakura?
5126000	5132000	Sentinel is badass. I just remember playing the Sentinel in the old X-Men Children of the Atom.
5132000	5134000	We actually talked about that this morning.
5134000	5138000	It came up in discussion on recording Comic Insanity.
5138000	5140000	Plug plug.
5140000	5144000	I think the consensus is that, yeah, cool characters.
5144000	5147000	I mean, there's still no Strider here, so what's up with that?
5147000	5151000	Alright, let's move on to some Sega Genesis stuff that's been added to Steam.
5151000	5154000	If you didn't know, you can buy old Sega Genesis games available on Steam,
5154000	5160000	and that way you can feel good about all those ROMs that you're playing that you're actually paying for them.
5160000	5162000	And, you know, it's all through Steam and all that good stuff.
5162000	5165000	You can talk to people using the Steam interface and all that.
5165000	5170000	Alien Soldier, Landstalker, Light Crusader, Shining Force, Shining Force 2, Shining in the Darkness,
5170000	5175000	Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic and Knuckles, Streets of Rage, Streets of Rage 2,
5175000	5180000	Toejam and Earl, Toejam and Earl in Panic on Frunkatron, and Wonder Boy 3 Monster Lair.
5180000	5181000	They are all there.
5181000	5183000	You did say Gunstar Heroes, didn't you?
5183000	5188000	Yeah, Gunstar Heroes was also recently released, so I think that might be what is already there.
5188000	5194000	But there is now a new collection that I think has some of that stuff, and new stuff as well.
5194000	5199000	I think those are all the sections with the old games.
5199000	5202000	Let me see, what is the new stuff here?
5202000	5203000	Ah, there we go.
5203000	5209000	Alien Soldier, Gunstar Heroes, Landstalker, Light Crusader, Shining Force, Shining Force 2,
5209000	5213000	Streets of Rage, Streets of Rage 2, Wonder Boy 3.
5213000	5218000	Lots of Genesis games. Go look at it on Steam.
5218000	5220000	QuakeCon.
5220000	5226000	If there's any fans of Quake in the house, QuakeCon 2011 is taking place August 4th through 7th this year.
5226000	5231000	It's going to be in Dallas, Texas at the Hilton Anatole.
5231000	5235000	So you could also bring in your PC and play some Quake there, LAN.
5235000	5236000	Have fun.
5236000	5239000	It'll be interesting to see what they're going to announce at this.
5239000	5244000	I don't know if there's maybe going to be some stuff on Rage.
5244000	5245000	That whole new...
5245000	5246000	Oh, I'm sure there will be.
5246000	5248000	Yeah, so take a look for that.
5248000	5254000	Also, there's a brand new iPad and iPhone app for Pac-Man Battle Royale.
5254000	5256000	Remember that? That's the arcade game that's coming out soon?
5256000	5262000	Well, there's actually like a little teaser or whatever you want to say that's available on the iPhone and the iPad.
5262000	5266000	It's, I guess, like an actual first level of the game.
5266000	5267000	That's kind of cool.
5267000	5272000	So you can actually play that and then check it out in the arcades near you.
5272000	5274000	It sucks that it's not a full game.
5274000	5276000	It does kind of suck that you can't buy the full game.
5276000	5280000	Maybe that's coming later after people play some of the arcades. Who knows?
5280000	5282000	Silent Hill Downpour.
5282000	5284000	We have some new stuff on Silent Hill Downpour.
5284000	5286000	It's music from the game.
5286000	5289000	But here's the thing. It's not by Akira Yamaoka.
5289000	5291000	Sad face.
5291000	5293000	Yeah, unfortunately, he's out of the picture.
5293000	5298000	Remember, he went over what the rumor is he's doing something with EA that maybe we'll see more about at E3 this year.
5298000	5300000	He is no longer with the Silent Hill team.
5300000	5301000	So who have they brought in?
5301000	5303000	Well, they've brought in Dan Licht.
5303000	5307000	He does Dexter, the music from Dexter on Showtime.
5307000	5309000	So I don't know if you know that show.
5309000	5312000	There's actually a little clip that's rolling around the internet.
5312000	5314000	We can play a little bit for you right now.
5315000	5317000	At least I can try.
5323000	5325000	See, it has an interesting sound to it.
5325000	5330000	But to me, it sounds a little more orchestra.
5330000	5338000	Whereas Akira Yamaoka felt a little more like dude in the basement banging random things together that made for an awesome soundtrack.
5338000	5342000	I don't know how to explain it.
5342000	5345000	This sounds like he's actually trying to emulate Yamaoka.
5345000	5351000	But, yeah, because it's got some of the same, like the mandolin in the background and some of the...
5351000	5354000	I really think he's trying to emulate Yamaoka's style.
5354000	5356000	Well, sure. Everybody loved him.
5356000	5360000	So it'll be interesting to see what this full thing looks like when it comes out.
5360000	5363000	Obviously, you can't tell from just a minute and a half clip.
5363000	5368000	Alright, that's going to do it for Rapid Fire News. Let's move into some Twitter topics tonight.
5368000	5372000	And see what you guys are tweeting us at twitter.com slash o-l-r.
5374000	5376000	Tweet, tweet, tweet.
5376000	5379000	Oh, a few tweets tonight.
5379000	5383000	Let's see, Spazinator wants to give us an update on what's going on in the video marketplace.
5383000	5392000	Not too much new in terms of freebies to announce aside from a preview episode of An Idiot Abroad on both PSN and XBL.
5392000	5395000	What the hell is An Idiot Abroad? I've never heard of that.
5395000	5400000	Surely that's not an anime. Is that a reality show?
5400000	5405000	I've never heard of this before. I'm Wikipedia-ing it right now.
5405000	5407000	An Idiot Abroad.
5407000	5414000	Let's see, an entertainment travel documentary on Sky One and Science Channel.
5414000	5416000	Starring Carl Plinkinton.
5416000	5420000	And Ricky Jervis is in it, too. Well, that's pretty cool, I guess, if you're a fan of him.
5420000	5422000	An Idiot Abroad.
5422000	5428000	Let's see, SHO 100 Matt is tweeting us, resident hockey fan here with some game-related news.
5428000	5434000	A minor league hockey team celebrates SNES NHL 94 style.
5434000	5436000	He gives us a link there.
5436000	5441000	And, let's see here, I guess, what is this?
5441000	5446000	I was playing on my old console, Super Nintendo, one day and I scored a spectacular goal.
5446000	5448000	And this is from one of the goaltenders of the Blazers.
5448000	5451000	Everyone just stopped and threw their sticks over their heads.
5451000	5453000	And I thought it was the funniest thing ever.
5453000	5460000	So it looks like when they actually scored a goal recently...
5460000	5467000	They started waving their sticks over their heads just like they did in the game. That's cute.
5467000	5469000	That's funny. I like that.
5469000	5471000	That guy doesn't even have a stick. Look at him.
5471000	5479000	What happened to that guy? He lost his stick. He's just waving his hands in the air.
5479000	5481000	I don't know why that's really funny, but it is.
5481000	5484000	And SHO 100 Matt continues with another tweet saying,
5484000	5491000	Also, two friends got me this awesome painting by 8-bit video game painter Adam Shub.
5491000	5493000	I guess is the name of the person that did that.
5493000	5495000	And I can't see the link that he put...
5495000	5496000	Oh, I see this one, though.
5496000	5498000	Oh, is that like the Earthbound?
5498000	5502000	I get linked to a DeviantArt page called Square Painter.
5502000	5507000	That's kind of cool. There's like a Ninja Gaiden picture and an Earthbound picture. That's pretty rad.
5507000	5509000	Very cool.
5509000	5511000	Dark Tetsuya tweets us and says,
5511000	5518000	On the topic of Daft Punk, any of you guys ever seen Interstellar 5-5-5 or Interstellar 4-5?
5518000	5521000	Freaking epic anime set to their Discovery album.
5521000	5525000	I've seen the one clip, like One More Time was a whole little anime thing.
5525000	5526000	They all are.
5526000	5529000	But I haven't seen the whole thing together. I've only seen that one song.
5529000	5535000	It's all by the anime artist. It's the guy that did Galaxy Express and that kind of stuff.
5535000	5538000	But yeah, I've watched the whole thing. I actually had the DVD at one point.
5538000	5541000	Might still have the DVD. I don't know.
5541000	5543000	But yeah, I've watched it. It's pretty awesome.
5543000	5544000	Gotcha.
5544000	5546000	Got a tweet as well from Leo Shen.
5546000	5551000	The MBC, Marvel vs. Capcom of course, 3 final boss has been leaked.
5551000	5557000	And we get to a YouTube here that says Galactus boss fight in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5557000	5559000	That apparently is the final boss.
5559000	5562000	There's this whole fighting going on on a TV.
5562000	5567000	This is probably very no-no that this is out here on the internet, but now it's out.
5567000	5571000	So there it is. They're fighting Galactus. That's the final boss.
5571000	5574000	He was awfully stunted for Galactus.
5574000	5576000	I think he's in the background.
5576000	5577000	Let me see. Yep, here he comes.
5577000	5578000	Oh yeah.
5578000	5579000	There you go.
5579000	5581000	Yeah, that's cool.
5581000	5583000	So what you're fighting is Pinky.
5583000	5585000	Mm-hmm.
5585000	5591000	Wasn't he the boss in like one of the other ones? Wasn't it 2 he also the boss in?
5591000	5593000	I thought it was Onslaught.
5593000	5596000	I think Onslaught was the boss in the first one.
5596000	5597000	Damn.
5597000	5598000	The second one, no I don't-
5598000	5600000	You suck.
5600000	5602000	I don't remember now actually.
5602000	5605000	I know it was in Galactus.
5605000	5612000	And everyone keeps picking on Galactus. All he wants is a sandwich made out of, you know, a planet.
5612000	5613000	Alright.
5613000	5619000	Tigerclaw sent us some links, but sadly they are stories that are coming up later, so I gotta save those for a little later.
5619000	5620000	That does it for Twitter tonight.
5620000	5624000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us some tweets in the future.
5624000	5626000	We'll get to those later on.
5626000	5628000	Alright, let's move on with some more stories.
5628000	5629000	Loki.
5629000	5630000	Yes.
5630000	5636000	So, this is kind of cool I guess if you're either lazy or you are disabled.
5636000	5640000	For me I'd say it's because I'm lazy.
5640000	5648000	But MLB 11, they are including a one button association for the signaled virtual athletes mode.
5648000	5652000	And basically what it'll allow you to do is play the game using one button.
5652000	5660000	And it's gonna have AI handling all the fielding and the player only needs to press one button in order to swing the bat or pitch.
5660000	5668000	And it allows gamers who might not be able to throw a baseball in real life or wield a dual shock controller ease of play.
5668000	5670000	So that's pretty awesome.
5670000	5683000	And apparently the mode was inspired by Hans Smith, a baseball superfan with cerebral palsy whose limited mobility made it impossible for him to play a real baseball game as well as a video game as well.
5683000	5689000	And Sony San Diego added him to last year's MLB game as an avatar.
5689000	5696000	And then this year they went one step further with the disability friendly gameplay mode.
5696000	5698000	So that's pretty sweet.
5698000	5702000	Well that's kind of cool. I like that they kind of did that, you know.
5702000	5710000	Do you get to play online in the one button mode? I don't know, I can see people that don't need to be using that mode using that.
5710000	5712000	But hopefully that's not the case.
5712000	5714000	Well if you think about it, if you could do that, you know.
5714000	5717000	Get matched up against other people who are using that mode or something, I don't know.
5717000	5719000	Well that's kind of cool.
5719000	5721000	Eat a pizza and play the game at the same time.
5721000	5730000	That's kind of like, some role playing games let you do that. Like, I remember, it was like Final Fantasy or something had the one hand mode where you could just, oh yeah, Bayonetta had it too.
5730000	5731000	Bayonetta had a one button mode.
5731000	5732000	That's right.
5732000	5734000	I'm not sure if that was for disability though.
5734000	5740000	It probably wasn't actually, so we shouldn't make a mockery of a good thing that they're trying to do here in this game.
5740000	5743000	I think that's kind of cool that they're making it more accessible.
5743000	5744000	One handed mode.
5744000	5749000	So, there's a big big difference between that one handed mode.
5749000	5761000	Alright, well if you think maybe there should be more games like this that are easily accessible to those folks, or maybe there's just a really cool idea you have for an indie game, maybe this site is something you want to take a look at.
5761000	5770000	It's kind of a spinoff of a site called Kickstarter, which honestly I had never heard of until this project kind of came across my path.
5770000	5773000	8BitFunding is the name of the site. 8BitFunding.com.
5773000	5776000	It's what they call crowd sourcing.
5776000	5783000	Basically, you can donate to different projects and you might get something or a perk in return.
5783000	5787000	So, there might be these games that need help.
5787000	5790000	They need money to fund the games or what have you.
5790000	5798000	And if you buy into it, maybe with a certain amount, maybe they'll promise you 10% of the gross receipts.
5798000	5801000	Or maybe you'll get a cameo in the game.
5801000	5806000	Or maybe the developer will come over to your house or something like that or develop something for you in exchange.
5806000	5813000	So, kind of an interesting little thing is when I was first reading this, I was like, okay, so this is basically like a PayPal donation button.
5813000	5816000	Donate to my game. What is the big deal about this?
5816000	5818000	But it's kind of some of the perks that they're offering.
5818000	5821000	In fact, I'm kind of looking at the site right now.
5821000	5825000	Unfortunately, a lot of these games have not really raised a whole lot of money.
5825000	5832000	They did the same type of thing with this. I think it was on the, not this 8-bit funding type, but the other one that was group sourcing.
5832000	5838000	It was for the Cthulhu, was it Cthulhu Saves the World or something like that?
5838000	5839000	Yeah, I remember that.
5839000	5846000	They were doing the PC version and having all these different things that you could donate and get a character in the game and stuff like that.
5846000	5854000	Right. You know, I'm looking at some of these projects and all of them are looking for like $20,000, which I'm imagining must be the cost of a dev kit or to get the game online.
5854000	5860000	I don't know. But let's see, like I notice the game that has the most money right now is The Boo Keeper.
5860000	5864000	$105 is how much they've raised towards their $20,000 goal.
5864000	5869000	But the site is still new, so who knows. I'm trying to look at some of these little perks they offer here.
5869000	5875000	They're trying to get this in 86 days. Oh, they have like a little video as well from the developer. That's kind of neat.
5875000	5884000	And they actually will give a game for a $5 project or two games for $20.
5884000	5891000	A thank you package for $50. That's kind of interesting. Give your voice to a character for $1,000.
5891000	5897000	So that's kind of neat that they have like little perks like that if you really believe in one of these games.
5897000	5902000	And I like how they have like the little video from the developer telling you a little more about the game. So that's pretty cool.
5902000	5910000	So check that out. Even if you don't have any money, it's kind of neat just to hear about some of the indie games and some indie developers and the trials and tribulations they go through.
5910000	5919000	8bitfunding.com. What I also noticed was here was a magazine was posted on here that they're trying to fund an actual magazine for $1,000.
5919000	5923000	It's an indie gaming magazine. Kind of neat.
5923000	5930000	Maybe we need to get some of these people on our show to hawk their products. Who knows? Could be interesting. I like hearing about new ideas.
5930000	5935000	Alright. So 8bitfunding.com. Let's move on to some more stories. Dark Soccer?
5935000	5937000	Well, how about something on Kid Icarus?
5937000	5938000	How about it?
5938000	5943000	Well, it's not going to be out until after E3. Or Zelda for that matter.
5943000	5950000	They're actually saying that, of course, we've mentioned earlier that neither of those are going to be launch titles for the 3DS.
5950000	5959000	That they are going to be out early June which is right after E3. So it's speculated.
5959000	5966000	Maybe that's going to be because they're going to be improved maybe? We could hope.
5966000	5972000	I don't know though. When you said the news, I couldn't help but feel like this.
5972000	5976000	Yeah.
5976000	5981000	But it's kind of the news I think we were all expecting, honestly. I mean, if the game wasn't coming out of launch.
5981000	5986000	I was convinced Kid Icarus was going to make it out of launch though. They made such a big deal out of that at E3.
5986000	5991000	So it's kind of, last year anyway. So it's kind of shocking that it is delayed, but again.
5991000	5993000	It's just teasing, Rob. Teasing.
5993000	5996000	Well, you've got to make sure the game is great. Don't release a mediocre game.
5996000	5998000	It's gaming foreplay.
5998000	6003000	I'm all for them taking more time to do it if they need the time to make the game great.
6003000	6012000	So, it's just a bummer they didn't have anything done, ready to go with the exception of, I guess, Nintendogs and, what is it, the submarine game or whatever other weird things they have.
6012000	6013000	Oh, they're doing Pilotwings.
6013000	6016000	That's true. Pilotwings might be interesting.
6016000	6022000	I don't know though. I didn't feel Pilotwings 64 the same way I did the original S&S version, which is still one of my favorites.
6022000	6024000	I love Pilotwings on the SNES.
6024000	6028000	So, there you go.
6028000	6032000	Anyhow, Loki, what do you have for us? The mailbag is coming up soon, by the way, you guys.
6032000	6037000	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and soon your calls, the FUs of the Week, and so much more. Loki?
6037000	6043000	There's a lot more disappointing Congressman coming from California. I swear to God, it's just...
6043000	6046000	What do we have? Idiots working in Congress over here?
6046000	6048000	No, I didn't vote for him.
6048000	6052000	This time it's not Lee, though, so it is a different Congressman.
6052000	6064000	Joe Baca. He introduced against legislation back in 2009 that required games to display labels of warnings between violent video games and aggressive behavior.
6064000	6068000	Now, apparently, he's come back and now he's trying to pitch a similar thing.
6068000	6074000	He's saying that he wants a warning to be put on these games.
6074000	6080000	So, warning, excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior.
6080000	6090000	And it says, I guess, the 2009 act failed to gain momentum, but he's now relabeled it the Video Game Health Labeling Act of 2011.
6090000	6096000	And it's basically the same act with the same goal, putting warning labels on games rated Teen and above.
6096000	6107000	And apparently now, I guess the only difference this time around is that he's gained support of Virginia Congressman Frank Wolf.
6107000	6115000	Which, I don't understand where a Virginia Congressman has any play in California, but whatever.
6115000	6130000	Anyways, it says, just as we warn smokers of health consequences of tobacco, we should warn parents and children about the growth and growing scientific evidence demonstrating a relationship between violent video games and violent behavior.
6130000	6141000	As a parent and grandparent, I think it's important to have people know everything they can about the extremely violent nature of some of these games.
6141000	6148000	Which is great, because that's what's on the ESRB label. It shows you what kind of content's in those games.
6148000	6153000	So you don't need to do this. I don't understand what the point is.
6153000	6160000	But apparently they are trying to move that forward.
6160000	6165000	I think we probably have a message for the Congress people involved in this.
6165000	6168000	Shut the fuck up!
6168000	6171000	That's how I feel.
6171000	6172000	Sounds good to me.
6172000	6184000	Like, you know, I mean, if you're gonna put warning labels on video games, you're gonna put warnings on movies, you're gonna put warnings on sugary candy, may it cause your kid to have a short attention span?
6184000	6194000	If you, I mean, I'm sorry, but first off, violent video games don't affect everybody the same way, and there hasn't been, there's been studies that go both ways with that. There's nothing definitive about it.
6194000	6203000	And we already have a label on the box that shows what kind of content's in the game. It shows if it's violent.
6203000	6207000	And if you read the back of the box, you can get a pretty good idea too.
6207000	6209000	You don't need, you know, another label.
6209000	6221000	You know, if you're gonna buy a game called Zombie Massacre, you know, 2011, the back of the box, you know, is probably gonna indicate to you that it's probably pretty violent, and that you will be massacring zombies in the game.
6221000	6229000	You know, you're not suddenly gonna get, you know, a game with puppets and rainbows and, I don't know, whatever. Stupid.
6229000	6231000	Puppet Rainbow Massacre.
6231000	6233000	That would be a little bit different.
6233000	6235000	They did that in an episode of Angel.
6235000	6240000	I mean, I'm sorry, but isn't there, like, a budget to be balanced? Aren't there jobs that need to be created?
6240000	6246000	Yeah, this stuff does cost money. I mean, and why are these congressmen, you know, like, wasting time on this stuff?
6246000	6247000	Seriously.
6247000	6249000	Especially California congressmen.
6249000	6251000	There's a word for it.
6251000	6253000	Two words, actually.
6253000	6255000	Budget allocation.
6255000	6257000	Funding.
6257000	6266000	In what? They're trying to get donations for their 2012 campaign by pleasing some moral superiority board?
6266000	6276000	It's the stuff like that that actually pulls in other funds for the different areas of, uh, the different committees and different stuff that they're trying to allocate money to.
6276000	6279000	They have the big problems because they need to go through and do a whole big audit.
6279000	6283000	And they need to have the audit done by someone not in government but by an outside party.
6283000	6288000	So, in other words, if this type of movement didn't exist, the committee might get folded?
6288000	6289000	Probably.
6289000	6291000	Then fold the fucking committee!
6291000	6293000	This is a waste of our goddamn time!
6293000	6295000	Everybody's goddamn time!
6295000	6297000	Agreed.
6297000	6301000	One more time, Congressman Joe Baca, I'm expressing my First Amendment right and telling you-
6301000	6303000	This is also Baca.
6303000	6304000	Whatever.
6304000	6305000	That's funny.
6305000	6306000	Moron.
6306000	6308000	Shut the fuck up!
6308000	6310000	Thank you, Pendlet.
6310000	6314000	But, that was funny because, never mind.
6314000	6316000	Anyhow.
6316000	6321000	If that's the best thing that committee can come up with, then it deserves to be folded.
6323000	6325000	Moving on.
6325000	6327000	I can hear it in my head now.
6327000	6328000	You mad?
6328000	6329000	Yes, I am mad.
6329000	6331000	Alright, let me move on. Sorry.
6331000	6340000	Sarian.net. Remember that website? That was the website where you could play action Sierra games, adventure games, like King's Quest and all this stuff.
6340000	6342000	You could play it on your iPad.
6342000	6346000	And we were all sitting here going, just a matter of time before this thing gets shut down.
6346000	6349000	Yep, we are waiting for this thing to get shut down.
6349000	6350000	Guess what happened, guys?
6350000	6352000	It got shut down this week. That's right.
6352000	6358000	And the letter from Activision's legal counsel got posted on the website for everybody to read.
6358000	6361000	And I liked how some of this email went.
6361000	6372000	While we appreciate your dedication to the Sierra Classic Library and understand that you are a fan of these games, Activision has not authorized the development or distribution of these games via your website.
6372000	6380000	Accordingly, we must demand that you immediately cease any further distribution or exploitation, I like that word, of the Sierra games on your website.
6380000	6387000	Now, as much as you want to paint Activision as the big bad evil people, I don't know.
6387000	6393000	They kind of do have a point. I mean, it is their games and this whole thing, posting them public, you know.
6393000	6397000	But if you're not going to do anything with it, then what the hell are you doing?
6397000	6403000	However, it could be argued that these games are available for sale on good old games and on Steam.
6403000	6407000	So if you're going to get these games, then you should do them the legitimate way.
6407000	6413000	And if Activision wanted to do an iPad release of the game, well, then this website is kind of getting in the way.
6413000	6423000	Well, there is another interesting development that happened this week that's worth mentioning, and that is that it wasn't totally shut down after the cease and desist.
6423000	6430000	It looks like Activision ended up giving Sarian approval to continue running in a limited capacity.
6430000	6438000	Sarian.net is now able to publish the first game of any series in its multiplayer HTML5 form.
6438000	6442000	So I guess this whole new little way of doing it is available.
6442000	6447000	However, the iPad versions are no longer there because they might want to develop it sometimes.
6447000	6453000	And Activision has allowed at least that, which I think is somewhat generous.
6453000	6456000	There are also links to buy the games on Steam on the website.
6456000	6458000	This is free advertising for retro titles.
6458000	6466000	It is. So, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like, as much as you want to hate Activision, you can't say they're not doing anything with this.
6466000	6478000	You are able to buy the games legitimately out there somewhere. So, I don't know, it's a little bit hard for me to get mad at Activision for cease and desisting, somebody trying to give that away for free.
6478000	6487000	It does pain me that Activision continues to do nothing new in this genre, but I guess at least we always have the silver lining.
6487000	6489000	Which, by the way, Episode 3 was delayed.
6489000	6493000	But it'll be coming out when it's ready.
6493000	6494000	I see what you did there.
6494000	6495000	That's right.
6495000	6500000	Let's go to the mailbag!
6500000	6504000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you can send us your emails every week.
6504000	6507000	And I gotta say, guys, the emailbag is still in a pretty sad state.
6507000	6514000	We got one email this week, and it's not signed, so I'll just say it's from Adam H.
6514000	6518000	Wanting us to talk about the PSP2 or the NGP.
6518000	6521000	And linking us to the blog where we can talk about that.
6521000	6523000	Well, I think we did go over pretty much the big stuff.
6523000	6524000	And done.
6524000	6526000	That's right, we did go over the big stuff in Part A.
6526000	6530000	I will give the courtesy of looking at this website here and see if there's anything we didn't cover.
6530000	6533000	Because you never know, there might be little stuff that falls through the crack or whatever.
6533000	6535000	Let's see.
6535000	6537000	Nope, screenshots, got those.
6537000	6540000	Uncharted Portable, yeah.
6540000	6544000	5-inch organic light-emitting display.
6544000	6545000	We already mentioned that.
6545000	6546000	Or did you use the word organic?
6546000	6548000	I did OLED.
6548000	6549000	Okay.
6549000	6552000	6-axis is in it, GPS.
6552000	6554000	Yeah, I think we covered all this, dude. Sorry.
6554000	6555000	But, hey.
6555000	6558000	There's some nice little pictures. I like the whole back touchpad.
6558000	6562000	Looks kind of funny with all the little PlayStation symbols over and over.
6562000	6566000	So yes, our mailbag is in kind of a sad state tonight, I'm sorry to say.
6566000	6569000	Mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you want to help us out for future weeks.
6569000	6571000	It'll fold your laundry, wash the cat.
6571000	6572000	That's right.
6572000	6575000	So meanwhile, let's get into some FUs, some angst.
6575000	6592000	I have three FUs, and I love you.
6592000	6594000	My FUs go to-
6594000	6595000	Aw, I love you too.
6595000	6599000	My FUs goes to being sick, because I hate it.
6599000	6609000	My second FU goes to the CW for playing Supernatural by a week, because dammit, I've been waiting for this damn episode.
6609000	6612000	It's like, stop teasing me.
6612000	6625000	And then FU to all of the people in the torrent community who decided to capitalize on the fact that certain people don't actually watch active TV and download the episodes as a torrent and decide to put out a virus torrent.
6625000	6634000	Which, thankfully, the moment you see the Windows error, you know, codec thing, you have to stop it before it goes to whatever site to update the codec.
6634000	6637000	So it doesn't, you know, actually virus you.
6637000	6638000	So yeah, stupid.
6638000	6642000	And my love you goes to Dan, because he's been taking good care of me.
6642000	6646000	Aw.
6646000	6648000	You're a little sick there, Rob.
6648000	6650000	Yeah, I mean, I think I caught whatever you guys have.
6650000	6651000	Rob's got our plague.
6651000	6652000	All right.
6652000	6655000	Loki, you have an FU of the week.
6655000	6664000	Mainly just to Xbox 360s being so delicate and fragile that they'll break within five minutes.
6664000	6665000	What, did you drop one?
6665000	6666000	I didn't drop one.
6666000	6667000	I didn't have to drop one.
6667000	6669000	I turned it on.
6669000	6675000	And then I switched the monitor resolution and it went ehhh and died.
6675000	6677000	So no.
6677000	6678000	The original consoles, man.
6678000	6681000	I swear, if you have a Xenon console, it's going to die.
6681000	6686000	It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.
6686000	6689000	That sucks.
6689000	6690000	I don't have a lot of FUs.
6690000	6692000	Things are relatively well right now.
6692000	6695000	So I'll just say FU to money or lack thereof.
6695000	6697000	Never having enough of it.
6697000	6700000	FU to Disneyland being crowded yesterday.
6700000	6702000	That's never fun to go on a crowded day.
6702000	6704000	Everybody else needs to go somewhere else when I'm there.
6704000	6707000	And I guess FU to the fact that I didn't get to spend enough time there.
6707000	6709000	It really was just like a fast, fast trip.
6709000	6711000	So, yeah.
6711000	6713000	That's really it.
6713000	6714000	Otherwise, things are pretty good.
6714000	6718000	If those are my FUs, then things are pretty well in my world.
6718000	6719000	Let's move on.
6719000	6720000	A couple more stories for you guys.
6720000	6724000	And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,
6724000	6726000	OrangeLoungeRadio.
6726000	6728000	Please make sure before you call us,
6728000	6732000	Echo123, if you are on Skype, you must, must, must test yourself first.
6732000	6734000	I think even Skype puts in there now,
6734000	6736000	click this button to make a test call.
6736000	6738000	You need to do that before you go on the radio.
6738000	6740000	Yes, listen to the nice lady that says, you know,
6740000	6744000	Hello, welcome to the Skype call testing service.
6744000	6747000	You need to hear her before you hear us, so please do that now.
6747000	6749000	But if you're using the phone, that's easy.
6749000	6750000	You can just pick it up and call.
6750000	6752000	All right, but we're not taking the calls just yet.
6752000	6754000	We got a couple more stories for you first.
6754000	6755000	Loki.
6755000	6760000	One other thing that was announced during the PlayStation conference,
6760000	6762000	and it wasn't necessarily the PlayStation phone,
6762000	6764000	it was the PlayStation Suite.
6764000	6769000	And what the PlayStation Suite is, is actually a couple things.
6769000	6775000	First off, it's gonna be a PlayStation store that's gonna be available for Android phones.
6775000	6783000	They'll allow you to purchase different PlayStation, you know, things,
6783000	6788000	whether it be PlayStation 1 games or other, you know, PSP minis or whatever.
6788000	6790000	Those are gonna be available as well.
6790000	6796000	But you may remember when there were some of the leaked videos of, like, the PlayStation phone out,
6796000	6799000	this was actually one of the things they could have been running on.
6799000	6804000	Of course, they were running a third-party homebrew PlayStation emulator,
6804000	6807000	but I mean, assuming that works, and obviously this works just fine.
6807000	6812000	And of course, some of the games that they're mentioning that are gonna be available
6812000	6815000	are actually early PlayStation 1 games.
6815000	6821000	Cool Borders 2, Syphon Filter, and Rallycross, Wild Arms, and MIDI Evil.
6821000	6827000	Yay, the same fucking PS1 games I already played on the PS3 again.
6827000	6829000	How about PS2 games?
6829000	6831000	Come on, there's a huge market.
6831000	6834000	You know, PS2 is like ten years old, some of the early games at this point.
6834000	6837000	The oomph to be able to do PlayStation 2.
6837000	6842000	Well, I thought the NGP is gonna bring the PS3 experience in your pocket,
6842000	6844000	and it's a powerful fucking little thing.
6844000	6846000	It can't play a PS2 game? Really?
6846000	6849000	Well, this isn't for the NGP, this is for phones.
6849000	6850000	Oh, my bad.
6850000	6852000	This is for Android phones.
6852000	6853000	Or the Android iOS.
6853000	6855000	Because we can't really say it's just for phones now,
6855000	6857000	since they do have tablets now with the Android iOS.
6857000	6861000	Oh, I remember something about this is all gonna tie into the NGP as well, too, right?
6861000	6864000	Android OS, not iOS, what am I saying?
6864000	6871000	Yeah, so it's a way to get PlayStation content out there on more than just the PlayStation phone.
6871000	6874000	So, neat.
6874000	6877000	But honestly, though, I mean, just looking at...
6877000	6881000	Unless you have that PlayStation phone, I can imagine this is gonna suck,
6881000	6884000	just because, I mean, just look at the controls.
6884000	6887000	It takes up, like, so much screen space, it's just ridiculous.
6887000	6889000	Yeah, touch controls are ridiculous, too.
6889000	6892000	You need tangible buttons. Forget it otherwise, honestly.
6892000	6893000	Yeah.
6893000	6895000	That's the one thing we've learned from iPhone gaming.
6895000	6898000	Very few iPhone games really, really work.
6898000	6900000	They have to be designed for that touch.
6900000	6904000	Things like Cut the Rope work, because it's very easy.
6904000	6907000	Things like, I guess, Angry Birds, although I've never played it, work,
6907000	6909000	because it's based around the touch controls.
6909000	6912000	Things like a port of Mega Man fail,
6912000	6915000	because you need tangible controls in order to be able to play it.
6915000	6919000	I will say that Espagaluda worked very well with touch controls.
6919000	6920000	Really?
6920000	6922000	Yeah, but that's because it has auto-fire and stuff.
6922000	6924000	I did it without auto-fire.
6924000	6926000	It actually plays really well.
6926000	6928000	And Mushihime-sama was really fun.
6928000	6931000	I don't know. I just, I need tangible buttons.
6931000	6933000	I thought that was all Sony's thing with the move.
6933000	6935000	Don't you like buttons?
6935000	6937000	Whatever.
6937000	6940000	Alright, one more story for you guys before the Skype line tonight,
6940000	6944000	and it has to do with World of Warcraft, but it's kind of an interesting one,
6944000	6947000	because you know where WoW goes, other MMOs tend to follow.
6947000	6949000	This is kind of interesting.
6949000	6953000	WoW has gone after gold sellers in a whole new way.
6953000	6956000	They have successfully petitioned PayPal
6956000	6960000	to issue notices to all the big gold selling companies that are out there,
6960000	6964000	that if they don't stop WoW's virtual currency selling,
6964000	6968000	then their accounts will be suspended permanently.
6968000	6972000	Very interesting, because these places are in other countries and so forth,
6972000	6975000	and they accept PayPal as a method of payment,
6975000	6977000	which a lot of folks don't want to give companies,
6977000	6980000	well, folks shouldn't be using these fucking things in the first place,
6980000	6982000	but on the other hand, when they do use them,
6982000	6984000	they don't want to use their real credit card info,
6984000	6985000	so they'll often use PayPal.
6985000	6988000	Well, now they've kind of cut off that bridge,
6988000	6990000	so I think that's kind of cool that they did that.
6990000	6992000	That was a smart way to go about doing it.
6992000	6995000	So yeah, that's how they're going after it.
6995000	6998000	Cut out the middle man.
6998000	7001000	And they could kind of strong arm PayPal too,
7001000	7005000	because I'm pretty sure they take PayPal as a method of payment for the game itself,
7005000	7007000	so they could tell PayPal either do this
7007000	7010000	or we're going to stop taking your thing as a form of payment.
7010000	7012000	They could kind of strong arm it like that.
7012000	7017000	I'm not saying that's what they did, but I could imagine that being part of the conversation.
7017000	7018000	Why not?
7018000	7019000	Makes sense.
7019000	7020000	Play hardball.
7020000	7025000	But I did like having PayPal for like for Star Trek Online,
7025000	7028000	because I would buy Cryptic Points to get my unlocks.
7028000	7029000	Right, but those are official.
7029000	7031000	That's not like buying gold.
7031000	7035000	No, but I mean, I think it's convenient to have it there,
7035000	7038000	like if you want to get like a little thing here or there.
7038000	7043000	And certainly, you pay 10 bucks and get 1200 points,
7043000	7047000	which I bought tons of stuff with my points.
7047000	7055000	So I think that they need to be a little bit more judicious with what they will and won't accept via PayPal.
7055000	7059000	Yeah, and honestly, if you buy gold online for WoW,
7059000	7061000	your own account is going to get hacked inevitably,
7061000	7064000	and you're just encouraging those people to continue to hack accounts,
7064000	7066000	because where do you think that gold comes from?
7066000	7068000	Hardworking players, you know?
7068000	7071000	So if you buy gold, you suck.
7071000	7075000	There are people that will help you out if there's something you really need to buy.
7075000	7076000	Get a guild.
7076000	7078000	Don't buy gold online.
7078000	7080000	I heart the guild.
7080000	7082000	Oh yeah, because they've helped you out.
7082000	7083000	Yeah, I know.
7083000	7084000	Find a guild.
7084000	7085000	You don't need to buy gold.
7085000	7086000	Find a guild of nice people.
7086000	7088000	And don't steal from your guild.
7088000	7090000	Yeah, don't steal from your guild.
7090000	7093000	If you're in the game to just profit profit and steal everything from your guild,
7093000	7095000	then you're in the game for the wrong reasons.
7095000	7099000	Play the auction house game if money making is what you want.
7099000	7101000	Buy out a certain item and then sell it for triple.
7101000	7102000	I don't know.
7102000	7104000	All right, let's open up the Skype line right now.
7104000	7108000	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7108000	7109000	The phones are open.
7109000	7111000	Take your calls on any topic we've talked about tonight.
7111000	7113000	Maybe you have a comment on the NGP itself.
7113000	7115000	Maybe you want to talk 3DS.
7115000	7118000	Maybe you want to talk about that whole PS3 hacking mess,
7118000	7120000	or something we haven't brought up yet.
7120000	7121000	Whenever you want to talk about the phones are open,
7121000	7127000	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
7127000	7128000	While we wait for those calls to come in,
7128000	7132000	Loki, do you have any quick last minute stories for us?
7132000	7134000	No, not really.
7134000	7136000	Well, not yet.
7136000	7142000	Actually, that Galactus video, that was someone that was playing on a pirated Xbox 360 version.
7142000	7144000	Naughty, naughty.
7144000	7146000	Naughty, naughty.
7146000	7148000	Because you can see the 360 in the background there.
7148000	7150000	Uh-oh.
7150000	7152000	Uh, let's see.
7152000	7154000	Some other fun stuff we could talk about here.
7154000	7157000	Um, this is kind of neat.
7157000	7158000	We haven't mentioned this yet.
7158000	7161000	Platinum's new game that's coming out, Max Anarchy.
7161000	7164000	Well, at least it's how it's known in other places.
7164000	7166000	It's coming over as Anarchy Reigns.
7166000	7168000	It's kind of an MMO brawler game,
7168000	7172000	and it also features the main character from Madworld,
7172000	7174000	but in full color this time.
7174000	7177000	And he's actually kind of in all the trailers and stuff.
7177000	7181000	Honestly, though, I kind of like him better black and white.
7181000	7185000	He doesn't look that cool when he's not in black and white.
7185000	7187000	I don't know. That's just my opinion.
7187000	7189000	Alright, let's go to the phones and take some calls.
7189000	7191000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
7191000	7193000	Hi, this is Bazinator.
7193000	7195000	Hey, Spazinator. What's on your mind, buddy?
7195000	7199000	Well, since it's too much the topic of the night,
7199000	7203000	I just want to chime in on the NGP or whatever it's called.
7203000	7206000	Whatever they end up calling it, sure. What are your thoughts?
7206000	7210000	Well, even though some people within the dial game community
7210000	7214000	would like to pick me as Sony fanboy,
7214000	7219000	I'm a little hesitant to even consider getting the NGP.
7219000	7226000	Although the system does sound nice on paper,
7226000	7233000	but the truth is, even with my PSP, I very rarely touch it.
7233000	7240000	Hell, nowadays I will use it for downloading podcasts and whatnot,
7240000	7241000	and that's about it.
7241000	7244000	Let me back up. Why did you abandon your PSP?
7244000	7247000	Was it a lack of the games that you have to play,
7247000	7251000	or what caused you, I don't know, are you a DS player now,
7251000	7254000	or what caused you to abandon the PSP?
7254000	7258000	Well, I was a DS player for a while, too.
7258000	7261000	I had both systems, but truth be told,
7261000	7270000	there's more games on the PS3 and the 360 that I would much rather play.
7270000	7276000	For example, on the 360, I constantly play Game Room,
7276000	7282000	and on PS3, I play a lot of Super Stardust HD, so on and so forth,
7282000	7285000	and between the two main consoles,
7285000	7287000	there's more games on there that I'm interested in,
7287000	7290000	as opposed to handheld.
7290000	7293000	Considering that I'm on the budget,
7293000	7296000	I have to watch how much I spend on games,
7296000	7300000	and don't really have enough money to go all the way around,
7300000	7304000	I would rather play my games on consoles, as opposed to handheld,
7304000	7309000	because really, isn't the point of handhelds to go out and about
7309000	7312000	and play them when you're not at home?
7312000	7319000	And I'm usually home pretty much 24-7.
7319000	7324000	Well, at first, yeah, I did play my PSP a lot initially,
7324000	7328000	playing the Darkstalkers games and the ports of PS2 games,
7328000	7334000	but I just generally find myself playing the system less and less.
7334000	7337000	So it's kind of the price that freaks you out, too, though,
7337000	7342000	because you mentioned that you have a very limited budget,
7342000	7343000	kind of like I mentioned earlier.
7343000	7346000	There's just certain people, especially in this economy this day and age,
7346000	7348000	that don't have a lot of the extra money,
7348000	7350000	and they kind of know this is going to be expensive.
7350000	7354000	So is it kind of like the price that scares you, too?
7354000	7357000	Yeah, basically, yeah.
7357000	7363000	I live under $800 a month, and that basically,
7363000	7371000	that $800 a month not even has to go towards rent, food,
7371000	7375000	my time order bill, so on and so forth.
7375000	7378000	There's not a lot of room for entertainment out there.
7378000	7379000	Yeah.
7379000	7382000	Granted, I managed to keep my expenses low
7382000	7386000	because the cost of living in Buffalo, New York is pretty low,
7386000	7388000	but still, even with that,
7388000	7394000	that leaves me with roughly $200 a month that if I'm lucky,
7394000	7397000	I'm able to save and whatnot.
7397000	7401000	In fact, it took me like a year just to save up for this netbook
7401000	7404000	that I just recently got.
7404000	7405000	Well, let me ask you this.
7405000	7407000	Let me ask you this, though, because obviously,
7407000	7410000	the system is expensive.
7410000	7413000	Do you think you would use or try to save up anyway
7413000	7416000	for one of the competitors to a PSP2?
7416000	7420000	Is there something that maybe interests you more about the 3DS
7420000	7422000	or maybe even the iPad, you could say,
7422000	7425000	as a competitor of the NGP, whatever it's called?
7425000	7428000	Is there either of those that maybe interest you more
7428000	7430000	that you would save up for, or no,
7430000	7433000	I'm not interested in this wave of technology at all?
7433000	7436000	It's kind of hard to say just now
7436000	7440000	because obviously, all those systems aren't quite out yet.
7440000	7445000	If I do consider going out and buying any handheld,
7445000	7450000	whatever, whether it be 3DS or PSP2 or what have you,
7450000	7455000	I would have to wait just to pull a figure out,
7455000	7459000	but let's say a year, year and a half,
7459000	7462000	wait to see what comes out for whatever system
7462000	7465000	and see if those games would interest me.
7465000	7468000	Then maybe, yeah, I'll consider getting them,
7468000	7471000	but if nothing of interest comes out for me,
7471000	7476000	like at least bare minimum, I don't know, 15 games at least,
7476000	7479000	then I'd just say forget it.
7479000	7483000	So in other words, it's the games that are on the system
7483000	7485000	that are going to make it or break it for you.
7485000	7488000	Yeah, and they would have to be like exclusive games,
7488000	7496000	not found on the home systems, no ports of any kind,
7496000	7500000	I mean truly exclusive stuff or interoperability.
7500000	7501000	I hear you, buddy.
7501000	7503000	It's our golden rule of gaming,
7503000	7505000	a system is only as good as the games that are on it,
7505000	7510000	so I think it's a smart approach for a budget gamer to wait and see.
7510000	7512000	Let the people that have more disposable income
7512000	7514000	kind of beta test everything for you, I suppose.
7514000	7516000	So Spazinator, I've got to let you go to get more calls,
7516000	7519000	but thank you as always, and who knows,
7519000	7521000	maybe you'll win a contest at a local store,
7521000	7523000	maybe win one of these guys for free.
7523000	7524000	I'll be hoping for you.
7524000	7525000	All right.
7525000	7526000	Yeah.
7526000	7527000	Have a good one, buddy.
7527000	7530000	All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR is our number,
7530000	7532000	or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
7532000	7533000	if you want to give us a call.
7533000	7536000	SSG100Matt agrees in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
7536000	7538000	The price will be key.
7538000	7542000	Bonds006 says, I am PC till death.
7542000	7544000	That's an interesting way of looking at it,
7544000	7546000	especially from the whole budget perspective,
7546000	7549000	is that, well, I have this PC anyway.
7549000	7551000	There's tons and tons of games available on PC.
7551000	7556000	Why even bother with a handheld or even a console?
7556000	7558000	I've got everything I need right in my PC.
7558000	7560000	That's the way a lot of people look at it, surprisingly enough.
7560000	7563000	877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7563000	7566000	Do we have any other last-minute stories, Loki, to hold us over?
7566000	7569000	Do we get more ringy rings?
7569000	7573000	Let's just see here what I've got here.
7573000	7574000	What can you pull out of your butt, Loki?
7574000	7579000	What can I pull out of my butt?
7579000	7582000	Let's see, can I have this all pulled up, too?
7582000	7584000	I don't want to know what Loki can pull out of his butt.
7584000	7587000	I meant, like, story-wise.
7587000	7589000	Not actual.
7589000	7591000	Yes.
7591000	7593000	There was a whole lot, actually.
7593000	7596000	It's funny, this week, I was surprised that there wasn't a whole lot of news
7596000	7598000	other than the PSP stuff.
7598000	7601000	Sure, other than that big press conference, that's really it, I guess.
7601000	7606000	It was just kind of like, wow, isn't that P or NGP awesome?
7606000	7609000	It's so awesome.
7609000	7611000	I wonder how much it's going to be.
7611000	7615000	And then, you know, 3DS was like, anyone remember about me?
7615000	7617000	I just got announced last week.
7617000	7620000	Oh, I think by the time the 3DS comes out, that will change quite a bit.
7620000	7622000	Yeah.
7622000	7623000	Well, we got another call.
7623000	7624000	You're saved.
7624000	7625000	You can find something else for after this.
7625000	7626000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
7626000	7627000	Who's this?
7627000	7629000	Hi, this is us for show on demand.
7629000	7631000	Well, hey, I haven't heard from you in a while.
7631000	7632000	How you doing?
7632000	7633000	I'm doing good.
7633000	7635000	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
7635000	7641000	I actually wanted to kind of give a mini review on a game that no one's really talked about.
7641000	7642000	Let's hear it.
7642000	7644000	But it's gotten a lot of controversy.
7644000	7647000	I played Galgun for the Xbox 360.
7647000	7649000	Galgun, okay, okay.
7649000	7650000	Set the stage.
7650000	7653000	What type of game is Galgun?
7653000	7658000	Galgun is a very perverted shooter.
7658000	7660000	It's a dating sim shooter, I should say.
7660000	7662000	All dating sims should be shooters.
7662000	7663000	Okay.
7663000	7666000	I'm interested so far.
7666000	7671000	So it's gotten a lot of controversy in it because Microsoft...
7671000	7675000	I posted a video in the chat room.
7675000	7680000	There's a lot of panty shots and a lot of questionable material in it.
7680000	7686000	So a friend of mine has a Japanese 360, so we bought it.
7686000	7694000	And we played it, and I felt immediately dirty afterwards.
7694000	7700000	You spray your love on them, by the way.
7700000	7702000	This game looks disgusting.
7702000	7706000	This looks like Elibits, but with girls.
7706000	7708000	Little school girls.
7708000	7711000	I'm sure they're all 18 or over, I'm sure.
7711000	7717000	Yeah, of course, of course. And you also get to shoot at teachers and all that, so...
7717000	7720000	This looks like Elibits. Is this like Elibits?
7720000	7722000	Remember that game on the Wii?
7722000	7724000	Yeah, well, you know what the funny thing when you mention that is?
7724000	7729000	The whole game has the feeling of a Wii game that was rejected,
7729000	7733000	but it was ended up cut out on the 360.
7733000	7735000	They wouldn't give up.
7735000	7739000	All right, so usually games like this end up being crappy,
7739000	7741000	but you felt dirty afterwards.
7741000	7743000	Was she tied up by a plant? What the hell was that?
7743000	7745000	A tentacle.
7745000	7747000	There's a boss battle in it.
7747000	7751000	Well, the whole thing is centered around when you start the game,
7751000	7753000	you have to choose a girl that you're interested in.
7753000	7756000	Now, the whole thing is you're trying to go through your high school and all that
7756000	7758000	to try to get with this girl.
7758000	7761000	And you have to go through all these women who are going after you,
7761000	7765000	hitting you with postcards and, you know, typical anime stuff.
7765000	7768000	Oh my goodness, postcards.
7768000	7770000	He might get a paper cut.
7770000	7772000	Yeah.
7772000	7775000	So what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to use a gun
7775000	7780000	that shoots pheromones at the teenage girls
7780000	7783000	that makes them drop down in ecstasy.
7783000	7785000	So it's like your love gun.
7785000	7787000	Yeah, it's a love gun.
7787000	7788000	I see.
7788000	7791000	And, you know, there's a special mode where you can zero in on a girl
7791000	7795000	and shoot her at specific parts of her body, like her legs.
7795000	7798000	So there's like a Fallout 3 mode?
7798000	7800000	Yeah, there is.
7800000	7803000	They're in the back.
7803000	7806000	And, you know, there'll be parts where she'll try to stop you
7806000	7808000	with her earring and, you know, certain things.
7808000	7811000	Are you allowed to shoot these girls in the butt or do they not like that?
7811000	7813000	Yes, you can shoot them in the butt.
7813000	7814000	Wow.
7814000	7816000	And, you know, it's funny because, you know, the game's so dynamic
7816000	7822000	that, you know, different girls have different hot spots, I should say.
7822000	7827000	Where you get an ecstasy bonus, as it's called.
7827000	7828000	Okay.
7828000	7832000	So, Matt, this is either like the best game ever or the worst game ever.
7832000	7833000	So where does it fall?
7833000	7834000	It's both.
7834000	7835000	It's both.
7835000	7837000	Because it's just so fucked up.
7837000	7838000	And you know what?
7838000	7840000	I was looking at it.
7840000	7844000	The people who made this game made a lot of kids' games.
7844000	7846000	They made, you know, the X-Men Zero series.
7846000	7849000	They actually made Mega Man 9 and 10.
7849000	7853000	So this is their chance to release some steam, so to speak.
7853000	7855000	Yeah, I guess so.
7855000	7858000	But, you know, the whole thing is, you know, it's very ridiculous.
7858000	7861000	And, you know, it's kind of tough to play because it's a dating statement.
7861000	7862000	It's all in Japanese.
7862000	7863000	There's no English.
7863000	7865000	And it's never going to come in America.
7865000	7868000	So we're kind of guessing through the whole thing.
7868000	7871000	But, you know, there's a lot of minigames and bonus stages.
7871000	7872000	You know, they're ridiculous.
7872000	7875000	But it's a ridiculous game.
7875000	7879000	Ikuma JP is in our chat room and he actually lives in Japan and he says,
7879000	7881000	I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
7881000	7883000	This game does not exist.
7883000	7890000	You might have to check, like, the back room of a store.
7890000	7892000	Like, I don't know how they have it set up in Japan.
7892000	7894000	But I'm looking at this on YouTube.
7894000	7898000	This looks real and I've heard of this before.
7898000	7900000	I just want to see the tentacle monster one more time.
7900000	7901000	Wait, was that sheep?
7901000	7904000	What the fuck?
7904000	7911000	I would say if Loki has a Japanese 360, you should get it.
7911000	7912000	Just for the last.
7912000	7914000	Loki, I think you need to bring a copy of this to the show one night.
7914000	7916000	Come on, it's episode 400 next week.
7916000	7917000	What do you say?
7917000	7918000	You need to figure this out.
7918000	7919000	You need to get one of these.
7919000	7922000	You need to import one of these real quick and get it over here to the show.
7922000	7924000	Expedite the shipping.
7924000	7926000	All right.
7926000	7927000	So anyhow.
7927000	7930000	That's bad.
7930000	7932000	You know, I had to take a long bath after this.
7932000	7934000	It just felt so terrible.
7934000	7937000	I'm sure those girls have to take a long bath too to wash what they got off.
7937000	7939000	I'm watching him shoot the teachers.
7939000	7940000	All right.
7940000	7941000	All right, Matt.
7941000	7942000	I want this game.
7942000	7943000	Thank you for bringing this into our lives.
7943000	7945000	How can we ever repay you?
7945000	7948000	I totally want this game.
7948000	7950000	I totally think you should get a game.
7950000	7951000	All right.
7951000	7955000	Thank you for the call, Matt, and bringing this game into our lives.
7955000	7956000	Take care, buddy.
7956000	7958000	Bye.
7958000	7959000	Oops, I missed.
7959000	7960000	Oops, I accidentally hung up on him early.
7960000	7961000	Sorry, Matt.
7961000	7962000	All right.
7962000	7963000	1877 game OLR.
7963000	7964000	Our username on Skype.
7964000	7965000	Orange on the radio.
7965000	7966000	AkumaJP says, just kidding.
7966000	7967000	I have seen it.
7967000	7968000	Estacy shot.
7968000	7969000	That's funny.
7969000	7971000	It does totally look like a rejected Wii game.
7971000	7972000	All right.
7972000	7976000	We've got time for a couple more calls, I suppose.
7976000	7979000	I don't know if you had another story for us, Loki?
7979000	7981000	Just real quick stuff.
7981000	7983000	No Kid Icarus or Zelda until after E3.
7983000	7984000	Yeah.
7984000	7985000	DarkSaga did report on that.
7985000	7987000	You were probably playing Grand Theft Auto.
7987000	7989000	No, I wasn't playing Grand Theft Auto.
7989000	7990000	You were playing Galgun.
7990000	7993000	I was not playing Galgun.
7993000	7997000	Of course, let's see here.
7997000	8002000	Seriously, we have like, Atlas is bringing out Divinity II, the Dragon Knight saga, which
8002000	8006000	is kind of an update to Divinity II with all the extra bonuses.
8006000	8010000	That's coming out in May or April.
8010000	8015000	By the way, there was some chatter earlier that accused me of never listening to Loki.
8015000	8018000	I just want to point out it's been proven it goes both ways.
8018000	8022000	Oh, I never listen to anybody.
8022000	8023000	It's called multitasking.
8023000	8028000	That's how we do this live show where we interact with the chat room, talk to each other, and
8028000	8030000	take calls, like the call we have on the line right now.
8030000	8031000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8031000	8034000	Who's this?
8034000	8036000	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
8036000	8037000	Hey, this is excellent.
8037000	8040000	Hi, how are you, buddy?
8040000	8041000	Doing good.
8041000	8044000	I don't know how I'm going to, I don't know what to say now.
8044000	8046000	I'm flabbergasted compared to that last caller.
8046000	8047000	That's all right.
8047000	8048000	That's the one update.
8048000	8050000	I don't know if I can do that.
8050000	8053000	You're becoming like the Ranma of the new year.
8053000	8055000	You're getting on this show every week.
8055000	8056000	That's interesting.
8056000	8058000	But hey, if no one else is calling in.
8058000	8059000	No, I try not to.
8059000	8060000	It's all you, buddy.
8060000	8061000	I try not.
8061000	8065000	I don't try to call unless one, you need the calls, or two, I have something to call in
8065000	8066000	about.
8066000	8067000	All right.
8067000	8068000	Well, what does it happen to be tonight?
8068000	8069000	One or two?
8069000	8070000	Two, actually.
8070000	8071000	All right.
8071000	8072000	What do you have to talk about tonight?
8072000	8074000	I want to talk about the next gen.
8074000	8075000	Yes, please.
8075000	8076000	A lot of people talk about that tonight.
8076000	8078000	I think the price point is even scaring me.
8078000	8083000	I liked what they were... Well, I was going to say, a lot of the things I liked when I
8083000	8088000	saw... I was watching the coverage as it came out, and I liked the little bit that
8088000	8095000	I saw, and the fact that I could actually have a handheld that plays quality games of
8095000	8100000	that of the PS3 would be absolutely amazing, but the price point, the fact that I know
8100000	8104000	it's going to come out, it's going to be like, oh, it's $799 or $800.
8104000	8107000	So that's what's going to scare me more than anything.
8107000	8110000	That one will be like, okay, I'm going to have to put that in the back burner for like
8110000	8114000	three years before getting in and trying to catch up with everybody else, so...
8114000	8117000	It will never sell if it's over $500.
8117000	8123000	Sorry, I just... This is the perfect time for us to kind of take a step back.
8123000	8128000	Let's hop in the time machine and go back to five years ago, 2006.
8128000	8129000	You ready?
8129000	8133000	Back in 2006, it was the Sony E3 press conference.
8133000	8134000	You ready?
8134000	8136000	Here you go.
8136000	8139000	Ridge Racer.
8139000	8145000	The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change, and the consumers are ready.
8145000	8150000	Genji 2 is an action game which is based on Japanese history.
8150000	8152000	Ridge Racer.
8152000	8159000	Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles
8159000	8162000	which actually took place in ancient Japan.
8162000	8165000	So here's this giant enemy crab.
8165000	8168000	Ridge Racer.
8168000	8172000	And you attack its weak point for massive damage.
8172000	8174000	It's Ridge Racer.
8174000	8176000	Ridge Racer.
8176000	8180000	PlayStation 3 will retail for $599.
8180000	8182000	$599.
8182000	8184000	$599.
8184000	8186000	Giant enemy crab.
8186000	8187000	$599.
8187000	8188000	$599.
8188000	8190000	$599.
8190000	8192000	It's Ridge Racer.
8192000	8194000	Ridge Racer.
8194000	8196000	Can't wait for E3 this year.
8196000	8199000	Sony always brings the lols.
8199000	8202000	By the way, that's one of my favorite YouTubes ever.
8202000	8204000	Ridge Racer.
8204000	8207000	That's one of my favorite YouTubes on the entirety of YouTube.
8207000	8210000	It's the Sony press conference in one minute.
8210000	8214000	For the love of God, make a new Ridge Racer game.
8214000	8216000	Ridge Racer.
8216000	8224000	Let's see here. Ridge Racer for the Xbox was the same as Ridge Racer 7.
8224000	8227000	Was the same as Ridge Racer on the PSP.
8227000	8232000	Was the same as Ridge Racer on, well actually the PSP version was like 4.
8232000	8237000	But the 3DS version is basically the same as Ridge Racer 7 and Ridge Racer 6.
8237000	8240000	All they're doing, they're not even putting any new effort into it.
8240000	8244000	It's like, eh, let's put the game over.
8244000	8246000	New cars, eh, let's port the game over.
8246000	8250000	X-ominor think that'll cost 599 US Crabs.
8250000	8252000	Alright.
8252000	8254000	Those are historically accurate crabs.
8254000	8260000	Alright, I'm sorry X-Link. We're getting away from what you wanted to talk about.
8260000	8261000	Did he, X-Link?
8261000	8263000	No, no, it's quite alright. I'm not gonna keep it too long.
8263000	8266000	It sounds like our connections seem pretty bad here, so.
8266000	8267000	Uh, well so, so-
8267000	8271000	But no, I just wanted to say that though, because you know, a lot of people, you know, like, I'm in between jobs right now.
8271000	8275000	I don't have 599 dollars to spend.
8275000	8281000	I don't, I do have a job and I don't have 599 US dollars to spend.
8281000	8285000	Uh, I'm a little freaked out with the price.
8285000	8289000	This thing better blow me if it's gonna be that much money.
8289000	8293000	I better just do more than that. My god.
8293000	8298000	This thing better come with a love gun or something, I don't know.
8298000	8301000	Alright. If they do, if they port gal gun-
8301000	8303000	Start talking to you sexually?
8303000	8306000	To the NGP. Yeah, I wanted to talk dirty to me for 599 US dollars.
8306000	8307000	I know, Rob.
8307000	8312000	If there's a gal gun on the NGP, then I might be able to be talked into it. I don't know.
8312000	8317000	Well, you know, this is gonna be a fun year nonetheless for E3.
8317000	8324000	And it's gonna be a lot of fun because this is gonna be probably the year of let's see who wound up who and what category and what area.
8324000	8327000	So, yeah, this is gonna be a lot of fun, I have to say.
8327000	8330000	He's shooting his love pheromones into that plant's mouth.
8330000	8332000	I can't, alright.
8332000	8336000	XLink, I'm sorry, they're still fascinated with gal guns, so I gotta let you go.
8336000	8338000	But have a good night, and thanks for calling.
8338000	8339000	Appreciate it.
8339000	8340000	Yeah, no problem.
8340000	8341000	Later.
8341000	8343000	Yes, you too. Okay, bye bye.
8343000	8345000	Oh my god, poor Inksfall on her from Ragnarok.
8345000	8351000	It's gal gun! Gal gun!
8351000	8354000	Ah, now everybody in chat's just being dirty.
8354000	8359000	Ah, you're all being dirty. SSJ100Matt says, Fleshlight attachment coming in June 2012.
8359000	8362000	Well, since you all are being dirty, let me bring this up.
8362000	8371000	Have you all heard of that show My Strange Obsession that's on TLC, the network that brings you hoarders and intervention and all that?
8371000	8375000	If it's got midgets or multiple kids, it's on our network.
8375000	8381000	TLC now has the show My Strange Obsession where they like to show things like there was the chick that ate couch material.
8381000	8382000	Yes, I remember that.
8382000	8385000	She ate the foam inside couches. A chick that slept with her blow dryer.
8385000	8386000	I saw that.
8386000	8394000	Well, this week, or maybe it was this last week, I don't know, they are going to have a guy who is infatuated with his real doll.
8394000	8395000	His love doll.
8395000	8396000	Good lord.
8396000	8400000	That believes he is married to it or something like that. I don't know what the deal was.
8400000	8405000	It was something like he treats the doll like it's a real person and sleeps with it at night.
8405000	8406000	Wasn't that a movie?
8406000	8407000	More than one way.
8407000	8411000	This is real life, apparently. This is not like Weekend at Bernie's. This is the real deal.
8411000	8415000	No, it wasn't. They had a member of us with... I don't remember the guy's name.
8415000	8420000	Nah, I think I know what you're talking about. Was that Simone? About the virtual chick that comes to life?
8420000	8421000	No, no, no, no.
8421000	8423000	De Niro was in that, but that movie went straight to video.
8423000	8424000	Oh.
8424000	8429000	No, there was a movie about this guy who had a love doll or something like that.
8429000	8435000	And it was like him and the whole town kind of pretended it was real.
8435000	8437000	For no reason. I don't know.
8437000	8438000	That sounds like a dumbass movie.
8438000	8442000	It was one of those fucking artsy films. I don't know what it is.
8442000	8446000	It was one of those things where I was like, really? I'm not gonna go see that.
8446000	8448000	Something the wife made you watch?
8448000	8451000	Oh, I forgot to mention! Oh my god.
8451000	8454000	Gaming Week. Totally forgot.
8454000	8461000	This week we had this kind of a kickoff for the 2011 year type thing.
8461000	8467000	They had people from different branches out and stuff and they were doing these team building events and stuff like that.
8467000	8470000	From Salacious Pop, Lance and the Real Girl.
8470000	8472000	Yes, that's it. Thank you.
8472000	8475000	Anyways, because I'm too lazy to look that up.
8475000	8484000	So they had a bunch of Connect Adventure games that we were competing in teams for high scores and we win stuff.
8484000	8492000	And I'd like to say that two out of the three days we kicked the crap out of everybody.
8492000	8500000	The third day, or actually I should say the first day, we would have won had we played together, both myself and my co-worker.
8500000	8504000	Instead we were on separate teams with other people, which is why we lost.
8504000	8509000	We won like $80 worth of movie passes.
8509000	8513000	Nice! What movie are you taking me to?
8513000	8521000	Well, we don't go to see movies very often, so when we do go we're gonna get popcorn, hot dogs...
8521000	8522000	$80 plus your kids.
8522000	8524000	$60 in bulk candy.
8524000	8528000	It's just a matter of time before your kids are gonna wanna go see every Disney movie, so you know.
8528000	8530000	I mean, maybe a couple years, but still.
8530000	8532000	Yeah, a couple years.
8532000	8534000	I just thought it was funny that we kicked the crap out of them.
8534000	8537000	Well, yeah, you're the video game team. You're supposed to kick the crap out of them.
8537000	8538000	Yeah.
8538000	8539000	Alright.
8539000	8540000	It was awesome.
8540000	8541000	Well, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.
8541000	8542000	Thank you guys who got through.
8542000	8545000	If you didn't get through, you can always email us.
8545000	8547000	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
8547000	8550000	But we're gonna go ahead and start to wrap up the show tonight.
8550000	8554000	It's a little early, but I guess it wasn't outside of the NGP.
8554000	8556000	Not a whole lot to say.
8556000	8558000	So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
8558000	8560000	We can just have an extra long after birth.
8560000	8562000	Uh, Darth Saker, your final thought tonight?
8562000	8565000	Uh...
8565000	8566000	Alright.
8566000	8569000	And by the way, the chat room is yelling. It's actually Lars and the real girl, not Lance.
8569000	8573000	And Salacious Pop says, it's actually really good, thank you very much.
8573000	8574000	I heard it was actually good.
8574000	8575000	Thank you very much.
8575000	8576000	It just looked dumb.
8576000	8579000	You know, sorry.
8579000	8581000	I don't know.
8581000	8582000	Alright.
8582000	8586000	My final thought tonight is, it's like I'm walking on sunshine.
8586000	8588000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
8588000	8597000	My final thought is, I never would have thought that Pandora would introduce me to a bunch of awesome music that I never would have heard of, thanks to Pandora.
8597000	8603000	Although it also introduced me to a lot of crappy music and music that I've heard of, you know, numerous times.
8603000	8611000	But, you know, it's a little difficult to hit, you know, the thumbs up and thumbs down while driving my car.
8611000	8612000	Good point.
8612000	8615000	Alright, well thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.
8615000	8620000	If you've enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask you guys, tell a couple people about our show.
8620000	8622000	Word of mouth is how we spread the word.
8622000	8624000	That's how we've been doing it for the past nine years.
8624000	8630000	We're not able to advertise in video game magazines or have E3 booths or, you know, have any of that.
8630000	8633000	We don't have a full-fledged team bringing news to you.
8633000	8634000	This isn't our day jobs.
8634000	8638000	We work very hard with balancing our family lives and all that stuff in this show.
8638000	8639000	And that's all we ask.
8639000	8640000	It's not a pity story.
8640000	8641000	It's just all we ask.
8641000	8643000	Help us spread the word about our little show.
8643000	8645000	And that's all we really want.
8645000	8646000	Leave us nice reviews on iTunes.
8646000	8647000	All that fun stuff.
8647000	8650000	And if you didn't like our show, fine.
8650000	8651000	Don't listen to it ever again.
8651000	8653000	But support other indie podcasters.
8653000	8655000	They do a lot of hard work.
8655000	8660000	Especially, of course, you know, we're a little partial to the folks at AllGames.com and the varieties of shows that are there.
8660000	8664000	But even if you're like, I hate every single show on AllGames, fine.
8664000	8665000	You're a real picky bitch.
8665000	8668000	But there's got to be something in the indie universe that's for you.
8668000	8670000	So support independent podcasting.
8670000	8671000	Thank you very much, guys.
8671000	8672000	Have a wonderful week.
8672000	8676000	We will see you back here next week for episode number 400 OMG.
8676000	8677000	Until then, good night.
