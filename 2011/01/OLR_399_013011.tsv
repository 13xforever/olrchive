10105	25818	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, January 30th, 2011, Sony unveils Project NGP, Portal 2 promises user-generated content, and could cloud save soon beyond the... Hi friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week...
31240	36164	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36265	40388	This is episode number 399 for January the 30th of 2011.
41750	48536	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games with the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
48976	49296	Hi.
49696	50356	Hi, how are you?
51217	53177	I am doing better than I was.
53197	54638	Yeah, I've heard you've been kind of sick lately.
54678	55538	I'm sorry to hear about it.
55698	57499	Yeah, but I have some warm drink.
57779	58179	Thank you.
58439	58979	No, you're welcome.
59520	62481	And I have my fuzzy blue binky.
62741	65442	Not a snuggie, but it kind of looks like one from far away.
65682	69683	It's very soft fleece, and I think that I got this as a freebie from somewhere.
70263	72824	But it's been super soft and goes with me on trips.
73824	75605	And it's like my comfort blanket.
75865	76366	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
93291	97835	If it was just like this blanket, then maybe I could be convinced.
97875	103960	But I kind of like being shrouded in my warm blanket and being able to pull it over my head if I want to.
104020	108224	Is it like a Linus from the Peanuts thing where it's like your security blanket has to go with you everywhere?
108717	109277	Well, no.
109537	109778	Okay.
109898	112939	But it makes me feel comforted when I feel weak and sick.
113239	113600	Okay.
113880	120503	And then I can use my really low... I just realized I touched that blanket when you were sick.
120583	121504	I really hope I don't get it.
122124	123385	It's been washed, Rob.
124185	127108	Alright, let's also say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki!
127128	127648	Hi.
128009	128809	How are you, Loki?
129550	130211	Sick as well.
130571	131131	Oh no!
131291	133113	I caught my son's cold.
133253	134154	Oh my gosh.
134294	135055	The plague.
135115	139158	That's alright, it's just... I feel like I'm marked because I haven't been sick yet.
139539	140199	Dot dot dot.
140279	141521	I really hope I don't get anything.
142201	143723	Well, sorry to hear about you being sick as well.
144063	145224	I hope you get over it.
145484	146605	Yeah, that's fine.
146685	158415	But I have to point out, just before the show started, while Bobby's show was finishing up here live at All Games Radio, you were giggling like a schoolgirl over there playing, what was it, Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC?
158515	159896	Yeah, episodes of Liberty City.
160356	167542	And it was really funny because you were listening to some gay dance music or something in the game while you were just blowing up
168917	174459	It was listening to the Russian electronic station in the game.
174739	175099	I see.
175199	189505	And then I was playing, well, I was working on map edits, and then I decided, because I still have the crazy car handling in place still, that I'd play around with that, so that's what I was doing.
190014	190354	Gotcha.
190935	194377	Well, it looked like you were having fun because you were giggling as your car was spinning around and around and around.
194397	198940	Yeah, because you're not supposed to be able to get in those cars because they go crazy.
199140	205344	But since I have the trainer, I can spawn cars and make it so I don't fall off of motorcycles and stuff.
205564	205864	It's fun.
206584	213768	Alright, and also joining us tonight, of course, you guys, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, as they have over the past, what, nine years we've been doing this show.
214188	226594	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you are listening to us live, because we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.AllGames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
227074	254376	and yes we are doing a show next week which is very brave because we are going to compete against Super Bowl Sunday in some ways I don't know I think most of it's wind down I think they're in like the last quarter by the time this show starts but next week's kind of a big deal for us because it's episode number 400 I don't think we're going to do anything too special we might have some surprises in store little things but you know we don't want to do because then we could do we could do a 400th special then we could do a 9th anniversary special then we could do a 10th anniversary you know
254716	256297	We don't want to overdo it with the special.
256317	257337	I like teniversaries.
257637	258818	Every week is special.
259298	259658	Dang it.
260218	263000	So we appreciate you guys listening to us over the past few years.
263500	264060	Really appreciate it.
265661	273264	Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Tiger Claw says, It's funny that Snuggies have taken off considering the Slanket was the first one to come up with the idea.
273784	277126	And Jim Sally says, Snuggies, now with 10% more Slanket.
277866	281768	So is Snuggie like the Zynga of the blanket making world?
281988	282368	I don't know.
283329	284029	Take with that what you will.
284409	293593	Alright, let's get into the show and talk about some video games and how is your gaming week and the types of video games you have been playing since you guys have been sick.
293653	295953	I don't know if you guys have been playing some games, but let's see.
296314	297294	DarkSakura, what have you been up to?
298594	300395	I've really just played World of Warcraft.
301936	302236	Addict?
303436	303776	Dealer.
305797	307718	Because I hate Icecrown.
309684	312806	And I hated it so much that I was like, I just need to power level through it.
313266	313966	Need to get through with it.
314006	314706	Need to get through with it.
315267	315987	I'm done.
316407	319368	And I have to thank Alan, by the way, for running me through that.
319529	324791	I don't think it was a dungeon, but it was like some tournament area.
325851	327252	And I think it was in Zul'Drak.
327837	329959	Oh yeah, the Ring of Blood or whatever it's called.
329979	331920	So I could get the Slobberknocker.
334622	337083	But it got me a crap ton of experience on top of it.
337223	337443	Nice.
337964	347650	So that saved me a couple hours of work and stupid quests to control water elementals, which sucked.
349151	352133	And now I just did the joust thing.
353273	354314	Yeah, there's a little parody.
354354	357955	And she's not talking like an actual joust thing, although that's in the game too.
357975	358775	You ride a griffin.
359055	365117	But there's like a make-believe 3D version of the old school 80s game, Joust.
366158	371039	And you get a pet from it that's one of the little griffins with a dude on it with a lance.
371859	372860	And you get to keep the lance.
373320	377661	Although I'm going to sell it for probably nothing.
377701	378162	It's worse.
378262	381663	It's like a zero to one damage item, which makes me laugh.
383805	389472	But I'm actually having a really good time in the really pretty Cataclysm area.
389532	390233	It's just really pretty.
391214	392336	Flowers and fairy dragons.
392476	393297	I love fairy dragons.
393317	395360	And I'll tell you why I love fairy dragons from D&D.
396561	398884	My friend played a fairy dragon named Shimata Hentai.
399004	399265	Mm-hmm.
400416	401257	So I thought it was funny.
402037	402477	And I'm done.
403338	404438	I'm high on Sudafed.
405279	406340	It's going to be a fun show.
406740	408301	Sudafed, Robitussin, and Benadryl.
408561	409541	Do you find that wow?
410682	413324	I'm still blown away every week this goes on.
413724	415745	That you were a wow hater in 2010.
415785	417346	I wasn't a hater.
417466	417946	Yes, you were.
417986	419848	You turned it all around in 2011.
420268	421268	I wasn't a hater.
421609	422829	Okay, you were a disliker.
423910	425191	I was just bored by it.
425671	427052	Disliker's going to dislike.
428860	439754	well you know me I'm gonna give something a chance before I decide that I hate it and enough like I said enough people said it's different that I had to give it a chance
440109	444611	Speaking of MMOs, I've got to go to a comment from TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
444631	448333	He says his gaming week pretty much consisted of playing DC Universe Online.
448673	449573	Still haven't reached level 30.
449993	451254	I think I'm around level 16 or 15.
452054	454655	So I've got to kind of ask, are there any other MMOs?
454675	457117	Because I know you're a comic book, even though you're not so much DC.
457177	458437	I know you're more of a Marvel girl.
459318	460818	Do any of these other MMOs interest you?
460858	464820	And you've talked also about maybe, maybe I need to go back to Star Trek Online and check out what's going on there.
465436	467978	Well, I'm missed on Star Trek Online.
468178	469859	And I do miss my fleet.
470099	471540	They're cool guys.
475562	479585	I do want to go back to Star Trek Online for a month to see the new episodes.
480625	481746	But I don't know.
481886	484708	I mean, it really got to be super redundant.
484788	490191	And there's been enough different stuff going on in World of Warcraft that I think it's going to keep my attention.
490992	491252	Because...
491892	492332	and DarkSakura.com.
509902	514247	I've liked all the little neat throw-in stuff, and I really haven't had enough of that in Star Trek Online.
514827	515788	I'm gonna give it another go.
515828	517690	I mean, I love Star Trek Online.
517870	518451	It's fun.
518691	522775	I love everything about it, except that I've run out of shit to do.
523396	525338	Except the endgame got old, basically.
525871	528572	Yeah, pretty much, and I hate PvP.
529192	536094	I'm kind of curious what you're going to think of the endgame of WoW, because I know you haven't done a lot of the grouping, and to be honest, there's not a whole lot else to do.
536174	537094	Well, I take that back.
537134	543076	They've done a lot of stuff when it comes to reputations and crafting, and there's kind of that to do.
543096	547557	There's a lot of daily quests you can do, but I worry you're going to find yourself a little bored when you get to the endgame.
548257	549037	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
574567	576990	But I want to eventually get into it.
577010	580935	I got so wrapped up in questing and it was so much fun to me.
581136	582878	And I've got a worgen now.
582998	585722	I've got to make my shopping list over here for WoW School.
585742	588947	Okay, buy Sorting Hat for Jaimee.
591026	592307	I have a worgen now, though.
592967	597069	Because while I was feeling so sick and miserable, Dan decided to cheer me up by getting me Cataclysm.
597089	599310	And then promptly yelled at me for playing too much Warcraft.
601311	603352	But I named her Veruca Salt.
604552	605072	With two A's.
605553	606373	Veruca Salt.
606693	607333	Veruca!
607834	608114	Alright.
608214	609494	Because I couldn't get Volk's worgen.
609934	611235	Alright, enough MMO chat.
611275	612175	Let's go over to Loki.
612215	615537	I know he doesn't play any of them right now, so I'll ask him what has he been playing this week, Loki.
615939	621726	I've been playing, um, not a whole lot actually, just, you know, mainly like Grand Theft Auto stuff, cause that's fun.
622066	633500	Just been dealing with, I had my JTAG system repaired, and it died in five minutes when I got it back, so I was like, um, that sucks, so I sent it away to get fixed again.
635141	639004	I did play some stuff on the iPod yesterday, actually.
640264	644027	You may remember this from when we were talking about it.
644367	646188	It was a news segment we brought up.
646849	649431	The game Hamlet, or was it the...
650131	655753	The Last Game Without MMORPG Features, Shaders, and Product Placement HD
674200	699117	and basically it's like a point and click adventure game except really dumbed down in a way it's dumbed down the fact that you don't have an inventory you don't have any real exploration or anything it's just okay it's one level and then the next room you're in and the next room you're in and you have to solve a puzzle in each one and there's about 20 some rooms so I was able to finish the game in like 3-4 hours but um
701158	701958	It's just very weird.
724429	727093	Okay, now I'm interested.
727413	729797	Who from our generation didn't love Ren and Stimpy?
730258	733602	Yeah, you play this like... Rubber Nipples!
735766	738910	What rolls downstairs, hops over in pairs, runs over your neighbor's dog.
739898	751470	You play this time traveler or whatever who comes back to, I guess, Hamlet and accidentally crushes Hamlet and he's injured, so you have to basically do all the things Hamlet would have had to do.
752191	755114	And they've already teased a sequel, which is going to be Romeo and Juliet.
755234	755574	Hamlet 2?
756315	757756	There's going to be Romeo and Juliet.
757836	759597	Hamlet 2, Electric Boogaloo.
759637	762178	Bummer, because the Hamlet 2 movie is one of those movies.
762238	763178	I actually watched the movie.
763218	766079	Do you know they have a movie called Hamlet 2, and it's about a guy who's putting on a stage play?
766099	773843	It's a comedy, and it's actually not very funny, but it's one of those things that's so stupid, you kind of laugh in some parts.
774163	774923	Rock me, rock me.
774963	776444	Yeah, rock me, sexy Jesus.
776804	783267	It's so absurd, you have to laugh, because this movie clearly was just set out to offend people, and that was kind of funny.
784336	785557	But yeah, the game's pretty awesome.
785577	786998	The only problem I have is that it's short.
787038	789620	And once you've beaten it, there's really no reason to play it again.
790561	791481	Is it a free game, though?
791842	791962	No.
792262	792422	No.
792742	793243	But it's cheap.
793463	793703	Okay.
794424	796625	Well, as long as you kind of get what you pay for, so to speak.
796745	796905	Yeah.
797266	798346	But it was a good game.
799948	801389	And some of the puzzles are pretty hard.
802449	804631	You have to think about it, and they give you a little hint.
805031	807133	But that hint sometimes doesn't really help you.
809034	810856	But you can usually figure it out pretty quick.
810876	811336	Yeah.
811616	816999	I mean, I played the whole game through without using any sort of, you know, cheats or anything.
817119	818199	Is Telltale in trouble?
818540	822101	I mean, they are the kings of the whole point-and-clicky games right now.
822121	823162	It's a little different than that.
823262	827344	It's more of like, you know, someone that hasn't really played an adventure game.
827584	835268	It's very, okay, you solve this puzzle on this stage, you move to the next stage, and you solve this next puzzle, and they have little boss fights and stuff like that.
835328	838170	But the boss fights are just very, very odd.
838970	839830	The whole game is very odd.
841051	866882	uh Spazinator's in our chat room saying that he bought some Ren and Stimpy episodes via PSN I had no idea see I wouldn't know what the hell was on the PSN video store if we didn't have Spazinator in our chat room every week or on Twitter or wherever he's at because I never pay attention to what's on I had no idea he had Ren and Stimpy episodes can you even get those on Netflix I don't even know like I'm sure they're all on DVD but they're probably all over YouTube as well I don't know all right anything else uh for your gaming week you want to share with us Loki
869281	870742	No, no, that would be it
893301	894462	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
915922	916602	Thanks for watching!
937791	953778	and they have a couple neat things like they have a 9 minute preview of Tron Legacy which is you know what you would expect to see they turn the Muppets theater into the Tron theater which is kind of funny but they do like lighting effects where when the recognizer comes out the whole theater glows red kind of cute little things like that
954238	954758	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
983464	983785	DarkSakura.com
997811	1000795	It's guaranteed right now on the calendars through March 25th.
1001415	1002837	That means we should be there when we go.
1003418	1009164	But people are thinking like, oh, maybe it's not going to last through April when the Blu-ray is coming out.
1009465	1011807	But my other thought is, what are they going to replace it with?
1012108	1016553	Electronica replaced what they called Glowfest, which was the same type of thing, really.
1016693	1018355	It just didn't have a Tron theme to it.
1019496	1022819	And when you see the Tron stuff, it's pretty rad what they did.
1022879	1026882	But there's not a whole lot else to see besides that classic arcade and everything.
1027142	1030045	But it's crazy because this arcade is full of people.
1030365	1039773	There is a freaking line to play the Tron game, which they have perfectly placed in the back with a little subtle cutout in the wall.
1040453	1042475	Once in a while, you'll see things glowing behind.
1042495	1044797	I mean, it is perfect, this replica they've set up.
1045297	1070133	and they even created this is the thing that just freaked me out they created a game called Space Paranoids that they have in an arcade machine and it's clearly running on a PC because it doesn't use tokens but it's like in a cabinet and it's like a 3D game where you go around and shoot recognizers but you only have so many bullets it's pretty hot I think that's their browser they had a browser game that was like that
1070518	1073340	Yeah, it's probably just a browser game like as an arcade machine.
1073400	1074740	So that's what that is.
1074920	1079103	And I played Dig Dug, which is one of my favorite classic games.
1079163	1082304	Tease me if you will, but I walked out of there with the number one score on the machine.
1082344	1082925	Thank you very much.
1083565	1088488	So yeah, I don't know if it resets every night or what, but hey, I was happy for a minute.
1089088	1090069	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1113970	1116811	If you are anywhere near SoCal, you gotta see it.
1117171	1119433	If you're an arcade enthusiast, you gotta see it.
1120473	1121114	At least once.
1122194	1123775	It's a pretty cool thing to behold.
1123815	1131039	I can't say it's alone worth the $90 price it costs for a one-day park hopper or whatever.
1131359	1132340	That's pushing it.
1133080	1137643	But if you're gonna be going to Disneyland anyway, you gotta make sure you're gonna see this somehow.
1138443	1139304	I really hope...
1140253	1161126	that they went to all this work that they just keep it open like really they weren't using that building for anything else just keep the damn thing open until you have something really really good to replace it because it looks like they spent a lot of money converting that building into Flynn's Arcade don't I mean even if they're going to end Electronica keep the freaking arcade don't get rid of it please Disney so
1161926	1165310	Yeah, folks in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1165371	1167433	Shezro says, wow, Flynn's replica.
1167533	1167814	Nice.
1167954	1168374	Yeah, I agree.
1168394	1169115	It was pretty awesome.
1170077	1170477	Let's see.
1170617	1172139	Bochikawa says, that sounds awesome.
1172520	1173441	It was pretty awesome.
1173461	1174582	I mean, it was crowded, though.
1174622	1178247	I mean, gosh, I only had time to really play like the one game.
1179208	1179669	So there you go.
1180269	1183832	Tiger Claw says, Sky, are they blasting the Daft Punk soundtrack all over the park?
1184393	1185013	Actually, no.
1185454	1186394	They don't.
1186555	1189977	They do some of it, especially during the pre-show leading up to it.
1190378	1195021	But when the dance party's going on, it's mostly Top 40 remix stuff.
1195322	1198544	But they have people decked out in Tron outfits that are up there dancing.
1198945	1200046	And I felt kind of cool because...
1200606	1201287	DarkSakura.com
1220109	1249485	this is our makeup trip because we didn't get to go that weekend she had two of the discs one blue and one orange and like everybody was coming up to her asking her like where she got the discs and it was just from the freaking souvenir stores and you can get the blue ones at Target actually they have them at Toys R Us yeah so they're not hard to find but it's just kind of funny so Ziba wants to know if I took any pics yes I did I actually took some video too so I'll try to kind of put that all into a compilation video and upload that to YouTube or something if you want to see I'll try to get that up later
1250407	1251707	Alright, anyhow, so that was really it.
1251767	1255809	That was, uh, TigerClaw in our chat says, top 40 music, yuck.
1256649	1258750	Actually, I might be misrepresenting a little bit.
1258830	1266992	It's a lot of remixes of top 40 music, but TigerClaw, I know you like the electric and trance stuff, and I think you would be happy with the stuff that they played.
1267052	1268153	They played some cool stuff.
1268853	1274755	So, um, I know my friend constantly had her phone out with SoundHound or whatever that program is that lets you identify songs.
1274775	1275815	Like, what's this electronic song?
1275835	1276356	What's this song?
1276756	1277456	So, it's kind of a mix.
1278757	1282579	Okay, let's move on and actually get into the show itself.
1282639	1286721	For some housekeeping, please follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1287061	1291103	And also you can follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1291583	1294344	Next week is the 400th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
1294384	1298186	We'll be starting at 6 o'clock Pacific, promptly 9 o'clock Eastern.
1298206	1299967	Bobby actually has the night off due to this.
1300287	1304769	There's some football game that people care about here that a lot of people apparently are going to be watching.
1305289	1321830	and we have the balls to go up against it but if you must listen on the podcast feed then I suppose you can join us there too but it'll be more fun I promise if you join us live next week for the 400th episode of OLR all right let's get into tonight's gaming news there was some big stuff big conferences things to talk about right Loki
1322461	1327007	Yes, the big thing of course is talking about the NGP.
1327748	1335076	And the NGP is what I guess Sony is calling, what everybody's pretty much dubbed the PSP2.
1336038	1340082	And it is one sexy looking piece of equipment there.
1340803	1347447	Um, of course, they, um, had a lot of the stuff that was rumored to be in there.
1347707	1368157	It's a, you know, carrying a 5-inch OLED screen, uh, with pretty high resolution on it, four times the PSPs, a front touch screen, a rear touch pad, uh, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, dual analog sticks, um, and it looks pretty awesome.
1368678	1369158	So, uh,
1371301	1372126	Yeah, I've gotta get one.
1374425	1376166	They didn't really give a price point.
1376727	1380469	It is supposed to be out at least in one region before the end of the year.
1381350	1387434	And I guess it looks like both the front and rear little touchpads are multi-touch.
1387734	1389916	It does have a front and rear camera as well.
1390756	1392337	Built-in microphone, of course.
1393258	1403204	It's also got six-axis motion sensing, including a three-axis gyroscope, three-axis accelerometer, and three-axis electronic compass.
1404365	1408207	Wait, you said something that I think I just totally missed during the press conference.
1408227	1409487	You said built-in microphone?
1409727	1409887	Yes.
1410007	1411468	Is there a built-in camera on this too?
1411988	1412208	Two.
1413028	1413569	Front and back.
1414149	1416950	Oh, this thing's going to have video conferencing then, no question.
1416970	1417490	Yeah.
1417510	1419371	And that's something they didn't even really advertise.
1420311	1420731	Interesting.
1420771	1427954	There's no other reason to put a front camera on the damn thing than to have some type of competing FaceTime technology or whatever you want to call it.
1427974	1428815	Something like that, yeah.
1428835	1429675	Interesting.
1430795	1434876	and then Bluetooth and all sorts of other stuff.
1436156	1438077	But I'm pretty excited about it.
1438237	1440517	I mean, a bunch of things I know.
1441197	1449119	They were mentioning, of course, it's going to be backwards compatible with PSP games, like digital games, so you can play PSP games on there, PlayStation 1 games.
1449579	1450319	Yeah, but wait a minute.
1450339	1451800	What if I have the games on UMD?
1451860	1452900	Am I just kind of screwed?
1453060	1453260	Yep.
1454240	1456401	So it's compatible with PSP Go games.
1456981	1457201	Well...
1458896	1487059	but you'll be able to play that stuff on there and I would imagine that it's going to be fully compatible with the Playstation 1 stuff now because now you have the dual analog sticks and they're saying that they're full analog sticks so I'm not sure if you can click down on them for the L3 and R3 stuff but as far as like the L2 buttons that right there is your back little touchpad you know you can just the right half is the right button the left half is the left button
1487739	1509804	and then the shoulder buttons could be for everything else since I assume the multi-touch stuff is probably going to be also pressure sensitive so that would be kind of sort of analog but that's pretty awesome and it looks very similar to what you know the normal PSP 3000 looks like right now they're gonna also have I guess there's some
1513089	1520857	Some special slots for memory and games and stuff like that, because obviously they're not using disks this time around.
1520877	1527603	It's going to be a proprietary format for both, so it'll take just a little bit longer to crack, I guess.
1528704	1533908	and of course they were talking about some of the games that are going to be out for it as well.
1535029	1544055	Some of the games in the works, Uncharted, Killzone, Resistance, LittleBigPlanet and a game called Little Deviants which looks like the first kind of original game for the system.
1544495	1550339	Obviously most of their, I'd say all of their big franchise games are going to be coming out there.
1550720	1553782	They did show Uncharted which is
1553942	1554923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1577435	1581537	Call of Duty, Broken, Gravity Days, Hot Shots Golf, Hustle Kings, Reality Fighters, Resistance, Smart Ass, and Wipeout.
1607054	1607474	Interesting.
1608315	1614617	Well, they didn't name a price or a date, but if you thought they were going to do that this early, then you were kind of wishful thinking.
1614757	1622620	Because E3 is really the time to do that, and let's face it, when Nintendo first unveiled the 3DS, they didn't say any of that either.
1622680	1625981	They just came out with the price and date, what, two months ago?
1626141	1627922	And now it's coming out in March.
1628822	1632083	Or no, last month, and it's coming out in March.
1632103	1633504	Are we talking about price and date for the 3DS?
1633544	1633644	Yes.
1634767	1636307	Yeah, it just came out a couple weeks ago.
1636387	1639628	Sorry, I meant two months out of the actual release was when the dates came out.
1640188	1652272	So to think that Sony was going to release the release date of this and the price and everything now, 11 months before release or whatever, was a little bit... No, I bet they don't even know what it's going to cost yet.
1652612	1656633	They're probably trying to gauge the whole consumer reaction or also the price technology.
1656693	1658273	I mean, it goes down so rapidly.
1658773	1659234	So who knows?
1660774	1664057	Price is kind of important, obviously.
1664257	1666740	I think it's too early to say if I really want to get one or not.
1667480	1670023	I think it really depends on what's all there when it comes out.
1670623	1675027	I'm definitely getting one just because I have store credit for the Sony store.
1675047	1678050	$280 of that's already spoken for.
1678070	1682414	As long as it's not something stupid or ridiculous like $400 or...
1684586	1688167	Even $400 might not be that bad with $280 taken out of the way.
1689168	1693709	I'm actually thinking $400 might not be completely out of the realm of possibility.
1693749	1699951	I don't think it's going to be $400 because it would be hard to justify a handheld system being more expensive than a console system.
1701011	1702752	Well, here's the thing.
1703272	1705273	Look at its competition.
1705654	1706434	I understand that.
1706734	1707755	I don't mean the 3DS.
1708135	1709095	I know what you're talking about.
1709115	1709656	The iPad.
1710116	1712957	And the iPad with 3G is what?
1712977	1714198	$650 for the lowest model?
1714218	1714658	But here's the thing.
1718260	1718761	and DarkSakura.com
1743641	1746968	and I sure as hell am not buying an iPad.
1747909	1749653	I'm sorry, but you know.
1751201	1776646	that may be if they want to play that gamble then go ahead but I think it's going to end up flopping on them just like you know the PSP Go although this will be a little bit easier of an argument because it's you know a new system and stuff but you know they're talking that there's probably going to be multiple SKUs on it one for 3G one for Wi-Fi personally I'd just pick up the Wi-Fi one because I don't want to fucking another data plan exactly tethered to my fucking phone that's what I'm going to do
1778287	1789219	DarkKisuke in our chatroom is dying for an educated guess from us gaming analysts wants to know an educated guess for the price I'll give you my best guess I'm going to say $300 without 3G and $400 with it
1793562	1804208	I think that's... Considering the level of technology they're trying to put in this thing and all these other little features and stuff, I think that's not outside the realm of possibility.
1804748	1815913	However, one big, big wild card to keep in mind is Apple's next iPad, which they're going to have a big announcement and they're going to release it within the next couple months.
1817014	1819475	You don't have to be an Apple psychic to know that.
1820616	1846317	so if they manage to really cut the cost of those things that could make Sony have to kind of do a counter move but seeing as I don't want to go too far off base here but I believe those new iPads will probably have the same retina display that the iPhone 4s are using right now and it's going to make those things absolutely gorgeous they'll probably still be charging at least $600 if you want an iPad with 3GS
1847978	1864288	so we'll see so Sony can still at least be cheaper than an iPad if they do that and I kind of think that's going to be where their niche could be is that the Sony NGP could kind of be like cheaper than an iPad but does a lot of the same stuff at least as far as games are concerned
1865288	1870451	so, we'll see Ranma on our chatroom says, can someone tell me what NGP stands for?
1870891	1893783	Next Generation Portable it is a working name, like Natal was, do not expect that to be the final name, I would be very surprised if they really, I actually don't really care for that as a name because, and somebody in the chat had said it earlier, by the time the NGP releases, it's going to be the CGP, the current generation portable, so it would be a little silly for them to actually call it that
1894944	1896005	Remember the Neptune.
1897386	1898066	That's right, huh?
1898867	1902810	Or the Dolphin was the Nintendo GameCube at one point.
1903611	1905052	Or the Revolution was the Wii.
1905332	1907393	So these code names, nothing new.
1909315	1911276	I'm very curious to see what they're going to name it.
1911496	1914359	I kind of don't think they would do PSP2.
1914899	1917481	It doesn't roll off the tongue as nicely as PSP.
1918302	1918742	You know what I mean?
1921024	1925449	I know that sounds really nitpicky, but it's like all the extra syllables or something.
1925689	1929513	I know I'm being weird, but I just don't see PSP2 being it either.
1931112	1931392	I don't know.
1931553	1931893	We'll see.
1932954	1937138	Let's talk a little more about what's going on with the new Sony system and its feature.
1938179	1945826	I kind of like this because I like to see what the systems are doing besides just remakes of the same old games now on a portable.
1945886	1949029	I like to know where are they going to be taking the games.
1949510	1950731	So I was very interested with this.
1950791	1952493	Something called Live Area.
1953093	1955756	You might have seen some of the little promos, some of the art's
1956096	1958698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1982276	1983717	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2006713	2007234	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2021263	2021643	I don't know.
2043110	2043950	Very curious.
2071562	2085208	and people, you know what, that Pokemon thing with the walking trainer and all that was really popular so it's not outside the realm of possibility that people kind of like these ideas of being rewarded for going places.
2085228	2088750	3DS is doing something similar too with the whole coins thing, built-in pedometer.
2089250	2091331	So, hmm, will be interesting.
2092151	2093612	Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
2094412	2097055	Well, news for our UK listeners.
2097896	2107485	The 3DS eShop is actually not going to go live like they said it would with launch.
2107525	2109607	They actually said that it's going to go live in May.
2110949	2115171	Now, Nintendo UK said that it was going to be there with the launch.
2116012	2119434	But Iwata basically said, nope, nope, nope.
2119534	2123817	The first system update is scheduled for late May, the same time around the world.
2124337	2125177	So it's not just them.
2125618	2126198	It's everybody.
2128800	2131822	Which I'm glad Iwata came out and actually said something himself.
2132082	2136925	But, you know, they need to make sure that all of their reps are on the same page.
2138306	2138686	Don't you think?
2139665	2143126	Yeah, it kind of makes it sound like they don't even know when the damn thing is launching.
2143146	2144627	Kind of like, it'll be done when it's done.
2144727	2150689	It's going to be out in Europe on March 25th, but we won't have the eShop until the first system update.
2151890	2152190	I don't know.
2152210	2153471	Which is going to be in May.
2154211	2157572	Does it seem now that maybe they're rushing the 3DS a little bit?
2158313	2158693	A bit.
2158913	2161614	Maybe they should have just waited to release it until summertime.
2161734	2167316	I mean, maybe there's something about May, like why you have to release it in that type of time frame or something like that.
2167876	2168036	But...
2170178	2170839	I'm sorry, March.
2171741	2175787	I don't know why they couldn't have delayed this a little bit if it's not really ready.
2176268	2180254	I mean, they're going to sell most of these at Christmastime anyway, right?
2181556	2182998	That would be reasonable to me.
2185031	2185411	I don't know.
2186692	2190112	And I also say that because of the launch games.
2190152	2195194	It kind of doesn't have the must-have title that's going to be out at launch.
2196154	2206276	Probably the coolest stuff that's coming out at launch is the Street Fighter game, the Dead or Alive game maybe, and maybe Nintendogs and Cats if that's what you're into.
2206956	2209857	But that's kind of a stretch for a must-have launch title.
2210538	2212139	That Kid Icarus game didn't make it.
2213321	2215903	We haven't heard of the Zelda remake or any of that.
2216104	2218947	None of that kind of made the launch, so I don't know.
2221343	2222544	What do you guys in our chat room think?
2222564	2235449	Chat.orangeonsradio.com Well, I was going to say, actually, it does seem like that they're like, well, either we wait and put everything out together or we at least get the system out, get some early sales going on.
2236089	2240631	And then once everyone sees what else is on the eShop, then we get another boost in sales come May.
2241611	2242752	That's sort of what I'm seeing of.
2243908	2245450	I saw a lot of that happening at PAX East last year when I went.
2245470	2250715	Spazinator says, I'm a bit paranoid about taking portable stuff out and about, if only because I live in a rough neighborhood and I don't want to be jumped and robbed.
2265169	2266610	That's actually not a bad point.
2267791	2269953	Not everybody's going to want to find the players near them.
2269973	2270433	You know what I mean?
2270454	2271995	That could be a little scary.
2274177	2276378	And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this name incorrectly.
2276919	2284505	Nipros says, it does seem Netflix has Ren and Stimpy.
2285786	2286987	Since we were wondering that earlier.
2287027	2287728	Thanks for checking.
2288208	2288809	Appreciate that.
2289669	2290030	Good to know.
2291365	2301972	Well, you know, the other thing, too, is that something like that actually might work in Japan, because you remember with all the stuff that was happening with Monster Hunter, you know, that was such a big thing, and people would just randomly challenge it.
2301992	2310437	The Nintendogs thing, you know, that's something that I think would happen more often in Japan, but not so much here, you know.
2311337	2313419	Oh, years ago, the barcode scanner.
2314540	2321864	You just got people that are more into it who will go to the cons and just walk through the street.
2321924	2323685	God, I forgot about that game.
2323725	2327288	There was some type of battle game that was battle barcodes or something.
2327508	2328088	I remember that.
2328168	2334573	And they sold out of this one brand of ramen or something because it created some uber monster.
2334953	2336094	And then there was the CD one.
2337134	2365602	what was the game that you put in your CD and you get a different monster based on the CD and you got like this great monster by using Madonna totally don't know but well now it would be too easy to just burn your own CD yeah because obviously it was measuring track length and number of tracks or something interesting hmm all right let's go to the next story then we'll chew on this 3DS news a little bit see what happens closer to launch mm-hmm
2366482	2368583	And now back to more Sony news.
2369123	2376125	We talked about last week how the people figured out ways to load custom firmwares and stuff like that on their PS3.
2376465	2380026	So what's the first thing that happens when they do that?
2380106	2385848	Of course, release new PS3 firmware update, or this could even go for the PSP.
2386989	2389952	and patch all that stuff out or at least try to break it.
2390553	2391394	So that's what they did.
2391754	2394197	They released 3.56 firmware.
2394517	2399683	It adds no functionality whatsoever other than a security patch.
2400384	2405710	And it basically changed some of the keys on different things and...
2407645	2408626	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2428732	2432074	Other methods to, I guess, cheat the game.
2432634	2438537	And they've permanently banned those people from playing Black Ops in multiplayer.
2440000	2442340	Yay, cheaters get smackdowned.
2443581	2445181	You just think about that, future cheaters.
2445821	2448742	It's one thing if you want to cheat amongst people you know.
2449622	2455423	I don't care if you cheat in single player where you're not going online or any of that, or if you cheat with friends.
2456003	2461064	But going just to be power tripping in random online matches is a dick thing to do.
2462805	2464885	Dicks deserve to have dick things happen to them in return.
2465405	2472771	And you remember how they were saying, oh, well, there's no way for us to possibly stop these guys from cheating on our games.
2472791	2473591	There's no way.
2474252	2476073	Oh, poor us, Activision.
2476713	2477654	Yeah, I do remember that.
2477674	2478174	That was funny.
2478195	2480116	Weren't they trying to use that as an excuse or something?
2480236	2484619	Yeah, well, now the excuse is out of the way, and hopefully they're going to fix everything.
2484679	2490924	I do believe there was a patch for the PS3 version as well to fix some stuff, but now it's not an excuse.
2490944	2491084	Yes.
2493254	2493554	All right.
2494974	2499936	Let me move on to what's coming in a future PS3 update, if the rumors are to be believed.
2499976	2501296	And I would believe this, actually.
2502016	2512019	Apparently, there are some folks in the development community that are getting notices from Sony saying that in firmware 3.60, cloud storage for saved games will be available.
2512340	2513960	It's called online saving.
2513980	2515200	They're not calling it cloud saving.
2515741	2517761	Maybe make everybody think of Final Fantasy VII.
2517801	2518121	I don't know.
2518401	2520002	But they're calling it online saving.
2520682	2524146	This means that you could actually save files on a remote server.
2524186	2530271	So that way, if I'm playing a game at home, I could save to the online save and then access this at my friend's house.
2530291	2531032	That would be kind of cool.
2532073	2532514	There you go.
2533434	2538840	By the way, this feature will only be available, of course, to PlayStation Plus subscribers.
2539480	2540021	Ha ha ha.
2541061	2541622	So there you go.
2541902	2543403	And this doesn't surprise me at all.
2543443	2547846	I seem to remember when they first announced the PlayStation Plus that this was one of the features they were touting.
2548266	2551368	So it's not too surprising this is finally coming out.
2551709	2552669	Kind of a neat idea.
2553410	2554691	You know, I kind of like that idea.
2555031	2565458	And if you go to your friends' houses and sometimes forget your save files or hauling the memory cards around is too big of a bitch or whatever, you know, or you forget, then it's a neat idea.
2565478	2569901	I kind of wish Microsoft had one too that didn't involve save cards.
2570641	2572222	So, I think it's neat.
2572662	2573943	I don't know, is this a feature you'd use?
2574363	2576945	I don't think anyone in here uses PlayStation Plus right now.
2577365	2579506	Is this something that might make you want to get it?
2580087	2580287	Nope.
2580767	2580927	No?
2580987	2581328	Why not?
2581988	2588412	Because I'll never take my game saves anywhere other than, you know, on my PS3.
2588672	2593775	And if I really was, you know, aching to do that, I can just throw it on a jump drive.
2595056	2596837	DarkSakura, anything that would interest you?
2597702	2598523	It's a neat idea.
2598623	2605528	It's a fun concept, but I'd have to see it more in practice before I make a judgment on it, honestly.
2605929	2611373	This would have been perfect in the college dorm where everybody had a video game system and you're going from room to room.
2611833	2614055	That would have been great.
2614295	2617778	Something like that would have been cool back in the DDR edit days.
2619602	2619882	You know.
2635625	2662531	and the mom was all over the media saying he's autistic and he's just really good at games and Microsoft's like no we caught him cheating he's banned from the network just like anybody else would be and turns out it came to light yes he was doing that whole save file exploit thing where he can unlock achievements from opening up a save file and so yeah I don't care if you're autistic if you cheat you're a cheater and you should be dealt with appropriately that has nothing to do with the end result
2663636	2664257	Totally agree.
2665158	2673686	It doesn't matter the color of your skin, the sexuality, any type of handicap you might have, physical, mental, cheating is cheating.
2674427	2674867	Period.
2675468	2675968	You know what I mean?
2677610	2678531	It's just a little silly.
2680452	2697062	I like how when someone with a disability or some persecuted group will just come right out and say, oh, well, you're doing it because of this, this, and this.
2697903	2700745	No, you wanted to be treated like everybody else, right?
2702206	2703807	How far do I want to go with this?
2703887	2705608	How controversial do I want to be on the show?
2706187	2710809	There's a difference between actually singling somebody out and then treating somebody like everybody else.
2711029	2711289	All right.
2711809	2715390	Do you guys remember there was that burger joint in town that was very popular?
2715410	2716771	It was all over the Food Network shows.
2717111	2727155	And they ended up getting sued by the American Disability Association or whatever because apparently the place was called the Squeeze Inn.
2727815	2732957	And it kind of made its whole little reputation off of being packed and crowded all of the time.
2733737	2745965	and some folks sued them based on disability needs and the damn place almost closed that's ridiculous and I kind of I agree and here's the thing well technically it did close it did close and had to reopen in a new location
2746846	2766168	but they and this is important to say all you had to do was to honk your horn outside the restaurant and they would have served you whatever I mean they they you did not have to actually go into the restaurant so I don't think anyone was like totally being discriminated against or what have you you know it just it just kind of struck me as you know ruining it for everyone I don't know
2767153	2767734	No, I agree.
2768894	2769435	It was a mess.
2769535	2773939	But at the same time, that place never got more publicity than when that whole thing happened.
2774899	2775460	You know what I mean?
2776120	2777601	So, I don't care.
2778802	2779103	All right.
2779723	2780023	Let's see.
2780043	2780884	Moving on to the chat room.
2781365	2783166	Spazinator in our chat room says, I agree.
2793718	2794338	I think it's a good one.
2794978	2797659	I gotta read this comment from Derek H. Maybe lighten the mood a little bit too.
2798219	2801280	At our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com, Derek H. says, Confirmed.
2801660	2803540	Rob says it's okay to cheat with friends.
2803940	2806741	I think a lot of bored housewives share the same philosophy.
2807781	2810062	So are you saying that the mailman is a friend?
2810842	2812082	I'm not sure quite what you're saying there.
2812582	2812842	All right.
2813602	2814763	Well, if you're fucking him, he is.
2816884	2817826	I think you know what I meant.
2818807	2823475	It's okay if you're a bored housewife cheating in... What would bored housewives play?
2823555	2824557	Final Fantasy XI?
2824918	2825439	Bunko.
2825799	2826300	Bunko.
2826641	2828304	If you're all cheating in Bunko, you have...
2830595	2832396	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2856229	2856909	That's a house rule.
2856929	2857750	That's a house rule.
2857770	2858550	That's not a rule.
2858590	2859330	That's cheating.
2859790	2860411	You're cheating.
2861071	2863952	But you agree to house rules because it's kind of how you play with friends, right?
2864892	2866413	So, anyhow.
2868614	2869354	Let's move on.
2869935	2870855	More stories, Loki.
2873427	2879770	Okay, so this is kind of more about the whole firmware updates and whatnot.
2879790	2880770	It ties in all that.
2881611	2887894	Sony, of course, was granted a temporary restraining order against Geohot.
2889234	2889894	Basically...
2891095	2891856	Thank you for watching.
2913989	2930175	Obtained by hacking the PS3 and more to the point, he can no longer engage in acts of circumvention of the TPMS in the PS3 system to access, obtain, remove, or traffic in copyrighted works, which I don't think he was doing anyways.
2931135	2954626	and then of course there's still issues about the whole jurisdiction issues since of course he resides in a different state than Sony and a different state from where the claim was filed and they're saying that because he purposefully directed his activities at the Forum State of California they're letting it go through
2955847	2969447	So that's kind of, that's not a good precedent to be setting by the courts, saying, oh, well, because you conducted yourself on a website that was located in California, we can try you in California.
2972205	2978090	Anybody who uses Facebook or Twitter or whatever can be tried in California, no matter where you are in the world, I guess.
2978930	2980872	I find this comment from our chatroom interesting.
2980912	2982293	I have to ask Loki about it here.
2982333	2983274	It's from Napreos.
2983334	2984615	I finally figured out how to pronounce the name.
2984955	2986677	Napreos says, FGO hot.
2986737	2987457	He deserves it.
2987557	2988418	Cocky bastard.
2989079	2991320	Now, I haven't really seen this guy in action.
2991560	2995043	I realize he's been in the media and so forth, but is that a legitimate claim?
2995083	2995884	Is he really cocky?
2996244	2997465	Did he kind of have it coming to him?
2997725	2998986	I don't know if he's cocky, but...
2999967	3004071	It all comes down to... I mean, this is just part of the discovery phase of the whole trial.
3004812	3008055	It's not like Sony is getting his equipment.
3008876	3018846	I mean, they'll have access to it along with the lawyers to kind of make sure no funny business is going on, but it's not like this stuff gets shipped to Sony.
3019406	3020107	And even still...
3021644	3022184	Thanks for watching!
3041603	3059206	um and they've actually gone and they've been um doing ceases and desists on different um websites hosting files and whatnot but now people have kind of diverted that stuff to um a file hosting place off sea you know in other countries so they can't be touched I guess
3059486	3061167	Let me play devil's advocate here for a minute.
3061807	3077375	Not that I necessarily feel this way, but wouldn't that sort of be the equivalent of you shut down a file sharing site such as Pirate Bay or whatever because they're enabling people to facilitate illegal downloads.
3077415	3082017	They're not posting the illegal downloads themselves, but because they facilitate it, they're the ones that get in trouble.
3082677	3090463	I would say that makes sense if you're basically... If he was releasing the backup creator for it.
3090763	3094686	Yes, this could be used for legitimate backups, but some people might not use it for that.
3094826	3095927	That's not what he's doing at all.
3096267	3102332	This is basically saying... I guess it would be the equivalent of... I don't know...
3104818	3129773	A car salesman handing you the keys to a car And you go hit someone with that car They're enabling you to get in that car And murder someone with that car So they should be held liable for it That's basically what the equivalent of it is Dealerships actually do have liability Against that type of thing It's retarded I understand that they may get away with that In the laws of the United States Because it's absolutely retarded But people can sue and win for hot coffee It's
3134375	3144178	And granted, he posted stuff, and I'm sure they don't want people giving them backdoor access to the entire PS3.
3145118	3152780	And what he's done, yes, may eventually lead to piracy or easier piracy on PlayStation 3 because...
3153400	3163843	These tools allow people to run unsigned code and people can create unsigned programs for piracy purposes, but also they can create code for other things.
3165303	3172685	So it's not necessarily that he's directly responsible for it, but yes, he plays a part of that, I guess.
3173185	3176526	But once again, this court case isn't about necessarily...
3179329	3185491	I was going to say, and this is a great comment from Bob Coffey in our chatroom here.
3185971	3187031	Hackers aren't cheaters.
3187231	3188591	The trial isn't about hacking.
3188651	3193013	The trial is about your rights as a consumer, not about CFW or any shit at that.
3193293	3199254	The real precedent this may set is, do you own the computing product you buy or is it a licensed product?
3201161	3202122	Interesting note to end it on.
3202342	3203824	I guess we'll see what develops with this.
3222702	3225924	To prove that he did all this stuff, or he's actually doing it.
3226224	3229165	The problem is that Sony's claiming all these things that obviously aren't true.
3229585	3233927	Like they're saying, oh yes, he's pirating stuff, or he's enabling people to pirate stuff.
3234648	3238470	When they initially made that statement, that was not the case.
3239470	3244132	Now it may be the case, because now there's the ability to do that, but it wasn't anything he did.
3245113	3247194	So, I don't know, it...
3249887	3272572	it's difficult to it all depends on how intelligent the court the judges and stuff like that whether she's going to buy into this retarded nonsense alright well we will see what develops I'm sure we have not said the last on this so let's go ahead and move on to some release dates and travel the world and see what is coming out in a video game store near you this week
3274192	3275913	Not a whole lot this week, actually.
3276213	3277794	It's pretty sad.
3278434	3280855	But there will be some better stuff in the upcoming month.
3281575	3285056	This week, they've got a track pack for Rock Band.
3285856	3293839	If you're missing out on some country music, there's a second country track pack coming out this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3293859	3293899	Um...
3298194	3298794	Let's see.
3299194	3301035	Some other smaller games.
3301755	3305437	Junior Brain Trainer 2 is making its way out on DS.
3306337	3308018	The Sims 3 Outdoor Living.
3310098	3312799	It's kind of an expansion pack for The Sims 3 that's coming out on PC.
3316254	3316834	That's funny.
3318095	3319875	On PC, they have a game called The Ball.
3320216	3323217	Apparently someone took my advice and made a game about ball.
3324697	3325077	Wow.
3327458	3329559	That is coming out on PC.
3331720	3338583	And then, of course, a week from today, sort of, Mario Sports Mix will be out on the Wii.
3340723	3341084	That's it?
3342104	3342204	Yeah.
3342881	3343862	Wow.
3343983	3346085	It's a really, really dead week.
3346646	3347387	Is there a reason for that?
3347427	3348429	Is that just because of the 3DS?
3348669	3351873	It's just not yet into the middle of February.
3351894	3353516	February is a pretty light month.
3353656	3357321	I mean, it's more games than there would be in January, but it's not March.
3359043	3362507	Alright, well let's move on and look at Japan and what they've got coming out.
3362527	3364108	And I gotta tell you, it's kind of the same thing.
3364148	3365249	They don't have a whole lot coming out.
3365830	3366971	But there's a couple things to note.
3367151	3370755	Dodonpachi Daifukutsu Black Label comes out.
3370775	3373237	That's a cave shooter coming out on the Xbox 360.
3373277	3376340	That is coming out on February the 3rd.
3376621	3381486	And, you know, because they get a lot of those shooters over there where it's just pretty much...
3382006	3388070	That little center of the screen getting taken up with a shooter, but quite an audience for the shmups over here, too.
3388871	3389571	So you can check that out.
3389711	3395595	Also, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 gets its localized edition on the Xbox 360 this week.
3396035	3399938	That is also coming out on the PlayStation 3, and that's the only PS3 release this week in Japan.
3400919	3403801	Going to the Nintendo Wii real quick.
3404521	3404841	Nothing.
3406002	3411186	Things are dying down on the Nintendo front, of course, because of the 3DS's impending release on February 26th over there.
3412866	3415267	Although the Nintendo DS does have a couple things to note.
3415988	3420089	Dragon Ball Ultimate Butoh Tuden comes out this week from Namco Bandai.
3420530	3424411	Also, Gyakuten Kenji 2 comes out this week.
3424831	3427652	That is in a regular and a limited edition.
3427712	3428793	It's coming out from Capcom.
3428893	3431854	I believe that is a Phoenix Wright spin-off game.
3433635	3434535	That comes out this week.
3435836	3438037	It definitely has some of the same characters from that series.
3439057	3447785	I think this looks to be a little more like walking around adventure-y type of game, but I'm sure still the whole courtroom scenes and objections that you know and love.
3449126	3453209	Moving on quickly to the PSP, there's a release on there that some folks might be interested in.
3453310	3457233	White Knight Chronicles Episode Portable, Dogma Wars, comes out this week.
3457273	3460996	That's an official Sony product from Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan this week.
3461497	3465300	It'll be interesting to see what they improved on in the PS3 version, if anything.
3465760	3469121	Also on the PSP, Macross Triangle Frontier.
3469701	3471401	And that does it for your Japanese releases.
3471421	3472782	Wait, that's a Macross Frontier game?
3473302	3474882	Yeah, Macross Triangle Frontier.
3475162	3479243	Let me see, because Macross Frontier is the... Yeah, that's for the new one that came out.
3479484	3480544	The new series that was out.
3481384	3483805	Which Dan and I watched all the way through.
3483885	3484725	It's really good.
3485605	3486765	So this looks really cool.
3486805	3488406	Looks kind of like a 3D shooter game.
3489646	3510585	Not like a typical shmup, more like a polygony shmup game We're big fans of the Macross games, I bet it's a lot like the VFR games Actually, we've got Macross M3 for Dreamcast, which is a really good game So yeah, I love the Macross games Was that Japan?
3511075	3540446	that's it for Japan in the UK on February 2nd we have Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 we have long cookies on the 4th we have Earthrise Lord of Arcana Mario vs. Donkey Kong Miniland Mayhem Nailed Sega Mega Drive Classics Volume 4 and Two Worlds 2 that's it alright
3542914	3545976	Let's move on with some more stories in the Classic Game of the Week.
3546016	3546517	It's just ahead.
3547237	3554081	I don't know what's more ridiculous, the whole lawsuit that this company is facing or the name of this game.
3554922	3559205	But Facebook game Blingville is getting the cease and desist from Zynga.
3559265	3565329	Apparently Zynga believes that they own the rights to the use of Ville in any product.
3565389	3566149	I guess it's out there.
3567350	3569412	Gosh, what are you, the new monster cables?
3569472	3570353	I mean, seriously.
3570773	3575238	I'm going to start suing everybody for using Ville, or Doodle, or Monster.
3576579	3584347	But apparently, they have sent a cease and desist to Blingville LLC.
3584687	3587289	Well, a unique company name, I suppose.
3588551	3590753	The creators of the Facebook game, of course, that
3591033	3591774	has the same name.
3591995	3601288	According to Zynga, the use of vil in the game and the company's moniker infringes on its own collection of social gaming trademarks.
3601448	3607437	Blingvil, of course, not associated with Zynga in any way.
3607717	3608977	Thank you for watching!
3631582	3633544	I love Bress Lowell's comment in our chat room.
3633824	3634725	Cruella DeVille?
3635766	3637067	Will they be suing Disney?
3637928	3639769	I think that's possible.
3641151	3642071	Come on, Zynga.
3643052	3645635	I kind of find it to be a taste of their own medicine a little bit.
3645695	3647877	Wasn't Farmville like a ripoff of Farmtown?
3647917	3649058	Which of those two came first?
3649338	3650119	It was Farmtown.
3650559	3652661	Ah, so, I mean, come on, Zynga.
3653325	3657647	Whatever, Zynga's, like, evil, okay, and that's all it comes down to.
3657707	3674853	People hate Zynga, like, they don't have any original content, it's just ripped off from stuff, and they just, now they're suing people out of the way, because they're, they may, you know, come in and start taking away some of the money that Farmville or Cityville or, I don't know, whatever...
3675794	3681580	Just because you have names of stuff that end with VIL does not mean all of a sudden you own the trademark to VIL.
3681620	3682962	They're going to sue Danville next.
3683402	3688729	I think the people that made Farm Town should sue them because they started farm games, honestly.
3689249	3690611	If that lawsuit didn't already happen.
3690951	3692052	Yeah, I'm looking at Wikipedia.
3692152	3696694	I mean, I know it's not a definitive resource, but it's a pretty good place to start researching.
3696714	3702617	And I do notice it says Farmville started as a clone of the popular Farm Town, which also featured on Facebook in June 2009.
3702997	3705158	And there are some citations for that.
3705519	3706679	What's the other big Zynga game?
3706719	3708280	Isn't YoVille another big one?
3709261	3710081	Do they even have that?
3710761	3711142	I don't know.
3711382	3711802	Let me see.
3712522	3713402	I thought that's what it was called.
3713462	3714543	I don't see an article on that.
3715463	3717784	What are the other big Zynga games out there?
3717804	3719044	I want to know if they were knockoffs too.
3719725	3720065	Really?
3720325	3721165	Dan plays that.
3724206	3724646	Let's see.
3724706	3727047	I'm trying to see if they have a list of games somewhere here.
3727107	3727507	Oh, here we go.
3727547	3728287	Mafia Wars.
3728327	3729648	Wasn't that a knockoff of a game too?
3733942	3753336	I know this is very exciting radio yeah the makers of a similar online game Mob Wars sued Zynga over the launch of Mafia Wars accusing them of copyright infringement Frontierville that's the other big one too that's the one I always see on my stupid wall I don't think that was necessarily a rip off of anything though interesting
3755183	3755503	Alright.
3756263	3758604	I just think all of those Bill games are a waste of time.
3759164	3765826	You know, I would sit here and criticize it, but then, again, I can't stop playing that stupid Knights of the Clicky, or what is it really called?
3765886	3768827	Knights of the Crystal is the real name of the game.
3768847	3769908	That Square Enix one.
3770268	3771388	Can't stop playing it.
3771428	3773889	It's the dumbest game ever, but I just keep clicking.
3774469	3775089	Click, click, click.
3775789	3776550	Keep doing quests.
3776830	3779231	The artwork's really good, at least I can say that.
3779331	3779871	Get away with that.
3780911	3782433	Portal 2 is coming out on the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360
3802354	3807478	There's going to be a lot of cool stuff on the PC version as well, including mod tools.
3807538	3810220	What is a Valve game that doesn't have some mod tools available for it?
3810700	3813201	Some mod tools will be available on the PC version of Portal 2.
3815063	3820747	Unfortunately, that content is not going to be available on the 360 or the PS3, meaning the mod tools.
3821207	3831854	However, what they're saying, and this is a quote from Chet Felizik, who is from Valve, saying, the content that comes out is agnostic, and so we will be seeing that on all platforms.
3832234	3832634	and many more.
3855017	3877402	by the way, they are also saying that each of the game's two campaign modes will have individual surprise rewards when you beat them, so single player has one reward co-op has another there are two sets of credits and two sets of endings interesting, so if you really want to get the full game, you're going to have to play single and you're going to have to play co-op that should be very interesting
3878578	3890680	there you go Portal 2 coming out whenever Valve's ready I know there's a release date out there somewhere but I refuse to believe anything final until the game is actually out on shelves if you need something to play in the meantime how about the classic game of the week
3893422	3899564	It's a chance for DarkSakura to dive into the gaming vault and pick a game that she thinks, hey, you kids ought to be playing this.
3899604	3901244	This is a true classic game.
3901964	3906706	Instead of all this newfangled Farmville crap, and I mean crap.
3907206	3908166	Get off my lawn.
3908846	3910827	Go play this game instead and get off my lawn.
3911887	3913067	All right, what is the classic game of the week?
3913087	3913488	Pull up your pants.
3914548	3915948	What is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
3916028	3919369	I think that the chat room will be able to tell the moment the music plays.
3919529	3921670	Well, then let me pull up the little music here and...
3922768	3927677	And whoever guesses first in the chatroom, I'm looking, gets a no prize.
3929861	3931825	Alright, I'm looking at you, chatroom.
3937878	3940181	They're on a minute delay, so you might want to see it for a little bit.
3940422	3940742	Okay.
3941443	3946530	Well, it is Final Fantasy VI, or as we got it over here, Final Fantasy III.
3947812	3951697	And it is one of my all-time favorite games because of this music.
3951737	3952638	This music is epic.
3952678	3953780	It makes me want to climb a mountain.
3955021	3958083	Um, had a great, great, great story.
3958644	3965668	Had really amazing classic scenes, like the opera house, which of course everyone knows.
3966669	3974074	You know, the great, you know, this whole music plays when they're in their little, um, machine walker things.
3974154	3975855	And Bolchikawa gets the no prize, by the way.
3977456	3978657	Um, it was just amazing.
3980021	3987331	This game came out in 1994 in Japan, and then it came out in 1999 on the PlayStation.
3991238	3994721	It was amazing, like I've said a bunch of times.
3994801	4004068	It's actually sort of based about the second Industrial Revolution, meaning that it's got the sort of technical aspects into the game.
4004748	4016617	Character designs were done by Yoshitaka Amano, and he did pretty much everything with that game as far as the character designs and whatnot.
4017357	4027321	and, well, actually also he and Yoshinori Kitase and then, of course, the composer for the music was Nobuo Uematsu.
4027762	4028622	So it was really good.
4031003	4037826	It had, you know, random encounters and you had chocobos in your airship and it was just everything that one expects to be in a Final Fantasy game.
4038308	4040069	You had an active time battle system.
4040289	4042391	You had four players per party.
4043411	4049175	And you could also change your main person walking around, I think, by hitting one of the shoulder buttons.
4049976	4050716	You had your thief.
4050756	4054519	You had the runic ability, which was absorbing magic attacks until the next turn.
4054539	4055600	That was Selly's.
4057301	4058642	All kinds of different stuff.
4059822	4065566	And then you had your special hidden characters like Gal, who was the monster mimic.
4066827	4067287	And you had...
4069409	4070430	A Moogle.
4072232	4075055	Who, um... God, why can't I remember Moogle's name?
4075555	4075996	Anyway.
4076436	4077677	Mog, yes, thank you, it was Mog.
4077898	4079179	Because, because, Mog House.
4079800	4080120	Mm-hmm.
4080901	4084664	But anyway, um... And he had dances, which was always really fun.
4085805	4087627	The dude, it was all about Realm.
4088228	4089689	Who had the drawing attack.
4090210	4091511	That was really sick.
4091551	4091952	But anyway...
4093127	4096349	So yeah, it had all kinds of neat stuff.
4096549	4098630	It's very steampunk-y in ways, too.
4099151	4101052	Combining technology and magic.
4101212	4108096	And it had the most insane bad guy ever, Kefka, who just had this funny, funny laugh.
4111517	4112218	I know, right?
4112938	4114619	Oh, and don't forget the man.
4115260	4116740	If you can find the music, Rob, you should play it.
4117341	4117701	Shadow.
4118782	4119422	If I can find it.
4120575	4123411	because he was freaking amazing.
4125953	4130655	But yeah, it actually had alterations made in some of the character sprites.
4130895	4139619	Like, for example, there was this one character who you could see her naked butt, and they covered her butt up.
4141280	4147502	You know, some of the item names were changed here and there, especially for the PlayStation release.
4148903	4149663	Yo, you found it.
4151024	4152965	This is also the good music in the game.
4154767	4159468	Turn it up a little bit, Robin.
4159508	4163270	What did you say?
4164670	4170512	Dan said he would slit his mama's throat for... I know, but I forgot the line.
4171572	4175073	Wasn't Shadow... Like, wasn't the whole thing that Shadow's a chick?
4175833	4176053	No.
4176294	4178574	I thought... Isn't Shadow supposed to be, like, Realm's mom or something?
4179695	4180395	Realm's father.
4180495	4180735	Oh, okay.
4180755	4180915	Okay.
4182483	4190082	hinted at but never confirmed Dan's talking off mic that'll be confirmed in Final Fantasy 6 too when Square gets around to making that
4190788	4198494	But I mean, and keep in mind, you know, they used the characters from this for doing the Nintendo 64 demo, remember?
4199615	4202737	When they were going to put Final Fantasy 7 on the Nintendo 64.
4203658	4207341	Which the demo is kind of weird looking, but it was neat at the same time.
4207421	4211764	But this was seriously, I think it has to be one of the highlights of the series.
4212365	4213806	Definitely one of the highlights of the series.
4214927	4217629	And there's also discussion about it being remade for the 3DS version.
4220071	4220792	I think that's pretty cool.
4220992	4222374	That'd be neat.
4223816	4225398	But yeah, there we go.
4226752	4229855	There it is, folks, your classic game of the week, Final Fantasy VI.
4231236	4233578	Or as you might call it, it's so good, it's Final Fantasy VI.
4234179	4234919	I don't know, it's up to you.
4235340	4238382	Alright, that's going to do it for Part A tonight of Orange Lounge Radio.
4238402	4239303	But don't go anywhere, guys.
4239323	4240324	We're not done with the show yet.
4240364	4241405	Part B is coming up.
4241445	4242686	We have more news for you guys.
4243087	4246310	We're going to talk about an interesting funding program for independent video games.
4246330	4246930	We'll get into that.
4247310	4252135	Some clarity on the next wave of 3DS games, including Kid Icarus and some other things.
4253275	4256417	Some developments in that whole Sarian.net thing.
4256457	4258558	Remember how you could play like King's Quest on your iPad?
4258598	4259358	We have some updates on that.
4259678	4262400	We're going to get into all that in Part B as well as your Twitter topics.
4262460	4264241	So get them in at OLR on Twitter.
4264621	4269003	Your emails and much more when we come back of more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4275322	4277946	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4277986	4285036	We are live on this Sunday, January the 30th of 2011 for the 399th episode of our show.
4285076	4285517	That's right.
4285677	4289362	We hit a little bit of a milestone next week and then I get to start saying for a lot.
4290310	4292571	No plans of ending anytime soon.
4292651	4298293	We'll still be here until, I don't know, one of us is hospitalized for a long time or something.
4298333	4299254	I shouldn't say something like that.
4299294	4300614	God, I hope nothing like that ever happens.
4302455	4304356	Meanwhile, we also have side projects.
4304556	4307817	This thing's been going on so long that now everybody wants to do their side project.
4308517	4309077	Not everyone.
4309177	4309738	Not everyone.
4309778	4311658	Well, Loki, your baby is your side project.
4311678	4314779	That's kind of... 18 years worth of side projects.
4314799	4315519	Even if it wasn't.
4317280	4319201	Josh, the... I don't know.
4319261	4322442	I would love to hear Nellie do a podcast about video games because she kind of hates them all.
4322702	4324842	Well, she's like, I have to always stay here and watch the baby.
4324862	4326223	I was like, well, you can go do the show.
4326263	4327263	I'll stay here and watch the baby.
4327283	4328324	She's like, okay.
4329784	4330405	That would be fun.
4330445	4332366	I think on April Fool's Day you should send Nellie over.
4332626	4334087	We'll make her read stories and everything.
4334127	4335908	She'll be like, I don't even know what this says.
4335989	4336909	This is just words.
4337049	4337510	What is this?
4337750	4338891	You guys, what is this?
4339391	4340632	You guys care about this stuff?
4340652	4342013	She's welcome to bring Josh over.
4342213	4343654	That's right, yeah.
4343694	4345956	I'll watch the baby and she can read my stories.
4346256	4346976	He can't come over.
4348257	4348578	Alright.
4349278	4349558	Anyhow.
4351900	4353341	Other things to talk about that's going on.
4353401	4354622	Spinoff shows, side shows.
4355122	4357624	Dark Sakura does a comic book one every week.
4358164	4358705	Tell us about it.
4359031	4360172	It's called Comic Insanity.
4362575	4366759	We basically just talk about what's coming out this week, every Wednesday.
4367680	4370282	The show goes up on Tuesday, ideally.
4371183	4373065	We talk about what we're reading, what we're looking forward to.
4373085	4377369	We all have a pick that all three of us are going to read, and then we also review different things that we've read.
4377870	4381353	Like, for example, we all just read...
4383475	4404583	IDW's Infestation which I'll give our reviews on it I hated it and talked about other comics that we read and next week if you want to hear our review on a comic called Witchfinder then we will be reviewing that one next week
4405043	4411366	We also have an app for Android, so you can listen to episodes and tweet us.
4411446	4412846	We have our iPhone app coming soon.
4412926	4414547	Want to know our app for Android?
4414567	4415147	What the hey?
4415467	4417328	I'm working on this.
4417348	4417908	Yeah, all right.
4418068	4419129	I want to know more about this.
4420189	4421490	But I just found out about it.
4421690	4422490	Okay, that's fine.
4423090	4427352	So yeah, and you can find us on Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net.
4427839	4428119	Awesome.
4429300	4431581	Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth.
4431622	4435584	If you want more Warcraft talk, and how could you possibly want more after this show?
4435704	4440127	No, there's a whole show I have with my pal Extifer that we talk about Warcraft.
4440427	4442509	Didn't have a show this week, so I can't tell you what was going on.
4442869	4450934	Extifer had an emergency he had to deal with, so we didn't have a show this week, but we are going to be back next week talking about what's going on in the world of Warcraft.
4452515	4459041	There's a new patch on the horizon that's likely to drop this week, so I'm sure there's going to be a lot of talk about some of the changes they make.
4459221	4460562	They already put up a patch, didn't they?
4461583	4462844	Well, they patch that game all the time.
4463504	4467148	Oh, no, because I upgraded to Cataclysm, and that's when mine patched.
4467448	4467728	Got it.
4467768	4469830	Yeah, that's the patch you're thinking of.
4469910	4473953	But there is a new... It's the post-Cataclysm patch that fixes some of the problems.
4473973	4474554	The Fix the Arcane?
4474774	4475195	Yeah.
4475295	4476996	Well, I don't know if I'd go that far.
4478217	4479819	But we'll be talking about some of that next week on the show.
4480220	4487549	Also, Breslow would slap me in the face if I did not mention what's going on with USL Madness.
4488490	4493396	Under Station Live's little tournament that they do where they try to find the best video game of all time.
4493456	4494598	Time, time, time, time.

4541425	4542385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4560510	4563572	That's right, the Die in a Fire reference has made it into a video game.
4564332	4564773	There you go.
4565673	4570997	If it had said Die in a Boat Fire, then we'd know that they were listening to OLR, because I don't think you hear that expression anywhere else.
4571377	4575700	But if you have never heard Die in a Boat Fire before, DarkSakura's eating, so I'll have to explain it to you.
4576700	4578201	Oh, DarkSakura's gonna chew, chew, chew.
4578942	4579842	Okay, Die in a Boat Fire.
4581103	4582624	Why would you tell someone to Die in a Boat Fire?
4583192	4585234	I think it should actually be an oil tanker fire.
4597796	4600018	because then the water will be on fire too.
4601600	4602721	That's the worst kind of fire.
4603001	4604362	It's like, how do I put it out?
4604402	4605563	The water's on fire.
4605784	4606244	Exactly.
4606284	4607245	It's just more fire.
4607445	4607745	Wow.
4608566	4608927	All right.
4609507	4610748	Anyhow, let's move on.

4666035	4669478	And I hope to hell, I hope to hell this song is in it.

4753667	4754768	That's fine.
4754949	4762598	See, I was always super good at wearing... Actually, I was really good at wearing timeless Carmen Sandiego because I am a big history nerd.
4763018	4764500	I have been since I was a little kid.
4765241	4766222	You're just a big nerd.
4766482	4767804	And you have been since you were a little kid.
4768845	4769366	Yeah, and?

4797672	4800295	We don't know what's in it, but the snake oil lady said it would help.
4800395	4803277	Why can't we get further expansions to the Oregon Trail?
4803337	4804919	Like, you know, zombies.
4805580	4806981	Zombies have attacked your party.
4807822	4808883	Oregon Trail 2.
4809083	4810104	Fuck it, we're going back.
4813246	4818830	Wagon's East, Chris Farley, John Candy, Canadian Bacon, Invading Canada
4828871	4831932	All right, anyhow.
4832932	4845356	So the Japanese folks are getting their hands on Scribblenauts, and they're also getting their hands on a few additional characters and objects added in thanks to a translation from Konami.
4846836	4854639	The Japanese version will feature some wonderful Konami staples, including Old Snake from Metal Gear Solid 4,
4857420	4862561	And where is Twinby?
4863401	4864561	Where may I ask is Twinby?
4865081	4865742	I don't know.
4866222	4867182	Translation fail.
4867222	4869142	These are just the screenshots that were posted.
4869182	4870523	Maybe there are more things in there.
4870563	4872023	Maybe people haven't tried Twinby.
4872043	4872703	Okay, alright.
4872903	4873303	Fair enough.
4873323	4873924	So you never know.
4874264	4875184	DDR machine.
4877677	4883659	That's kind of cool, though, that since a different company kind of works with it in another country, it gets some extra Easter eggs.
4883679	4884200	That's kind of cool.
4884400	4890162	It's also rumored that if you type in failure, a version of Rock Revolution appears.
4892243	4893103	Miserable failure.
4893383	4894524	Oh, it's a copy of Rock Revolution.
4898188	4917695	Thanks to a financial quarterly report from Nintendo, a new Kirby sequel is coming from the developer HAL, and they have a teaser actually for it, and apparently it looks like a 3D Kirby game, just not all yarny.
4918336	4923798	So it is going to be a more traditional Kirby game, but still pretty cool looking.
4924478	4926799	Now with less yarn and more sucking.
4927560	4927760	Yes.
4927780	4929841	But that's a good thing when you're talking about Kirby.
4931401	4935143	Pokemon Black and White are actually getting some PC connectivity.
4936144	4947629	Apparently using, of course, they also have the PokeWalker peripheral, which was from Heart and Gold, but that won't be used in Black and White at all.
4947729	4949850	But they're going to have the Pokemon Global Link.
4950250	4953992	It's a website launching this spring, I guess shortly after the game is released.
4954232	4960917	which allow players to sync their save files to an online profile giving them an access to a wide range of tools including
4963508	4965149	to network with fellow trainers.
4965989	4976474	Also, check their battle statistics, assigning them worldwide rankings and granting them eligibility to participate in live regional, national, and global tournaments.
4977994	4985637	The site will host mini-games which let players collect Pokemon items which they can transfer back to their cartridges as well.
4986478	4991520	We'll also let them sync a monster from their games to the website and explore their
4992080	4996666	Explore their dreams online Nerds
4998371	4998811	Interesting.
4999671	5005692	And then, let's see, last but not least, Rock Band, of course, having more stuff coming out this week.
5006233	5010673	This week is actually going to be The Clash and their London Calling album.
5011434	5022956	You can buy the whole album for $20, or you can buy each individual track for $2 each, or whatever in your preferred console's space bucks.
5023796	5044002	Includes tracks London Calling, Brand New Cadillac, Jimmy Jazz, Hateful, Rudy Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, The Right Profile, Lost in the Supermarket, Clampdown, The Guns of Brixton, Wrong and Boyo, Death and Glory, Coca-Cola, Card Cheat
5044602	5048465	Lovers Rock, Four Horsemen, I'm Not Down, and Revolution Rock.
5048866	5060736	Of course, for it looks like London Calling, Rudy Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, Clampdown, and The Card Sheet.
5060816	5067161	They do have the pro guitar and bass expansions available for an additional dollar if you're feeling like that.
5069543	5071285	So look forward to that this week.
5074168	5074552	All right.
5076676	5080978	Moving on to some other stories, and we're going to start off with some news on Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5081318	5089841	God, they have done such a good job keeping this game relevant, because they let a little bit of news out every week about some new characters that are in the game, so pretty cool.
5090541	5102046	Sienko and Sentinel have been confirmed as characters that will be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, which is kind of funny, because I thought they had come out and said, no more Darkstalkers players, but yet it was a lie.
5102626	5103887	So, yep, there it is.
5105147	5105888	That would be fun.
5106068	5106388	I don't know.
5106888	5107969	Sienko is pretty cool.
5108229	5110650	I remember I used Sienko all the time in Puzzle Fighter.
5113112	5115973	She had a different name, I thought.
5116514	5117334	No, in Puzzle Fighter.
5117735	5120136	She was Lele and her sister was Mei Mei.
5121351	5122452	What about Sentinel?
5122533	5125476	Are you excited about these characters coming to MVC3, DarkSakura?
5126297	5127318	Sentinel is badass.
5127839	5131703	I just remember playing the Sentinel in the old X-Men Children of the Atom.
5131723	5133625	We actually talked about that this morning.
5134166	5137410	It came up in discussion on recording Comic Insanity.
5138111	5138491	Plug, plug.
5140914	5142675	Saga Genesis Steam

5180342	5181223	They are all there.
5181323	5182724	You did say Gunstar Heroes, didn't you?
5183444	5210897	Gunstar Heroes was also recently released so I think that might be what is already there but there is now a new collection that I think has some of that stuff and new stuff as well I think those are all the sections with the old games let me see what is the new stuff here ah there we go Alien Soldier, Gunstar Heroes, Landstalker Light Crusader, Shining Force Shining Force 2, Streets of Rage Streets of Rage 2, Wonder Boy 3
5213427	5213748	QuakeCon
5220273	5226416	If there's any fans of Quake in the house, QuakeCon 2011 is taking place August 4th through 7th this year.
5226476	5230438	It's going to be in Dallas, Texas at the Hilton Anatol.
5231198	5234480	So you could also bring in your PC and play some Quake there.
5234660	5235921	Lan, have fun.
5236361	5238522	It'll be interesting to see what they're going to announce at this.
5239342	5246406	I don't know if there's maybe going to be some stuff on Rage, that whole new... Oh, I'm sure there will be.
5246546	5248027	Yeah, so take a look for that.
5249127	5253690	Also, there's a brand new iPad and iPhone app for Pac-Man Battle Royale.
5254050	5254490	Remember that?
5254530	5256131	That's the arcade game that's coming out soon.
5256151	5261894	Well, there's actually like a little teaser or whatever you want to say that's available on the iPhone and the iPad.
5262354	5265936	It's, I guess, like an actual first level of the game.
5266196	5266857	That's kind of cool.
5267337	5271279	So you can actually play that and then check it out in the arcades near you.
5272992	5274953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5300439	5301619	So who have they brought in?
5301739	5303560	Well, they've brought in Dan Licht.
5304080	5307721	He does Dexter, the music from Dexter on Showtime.
5307841	5308902	So I don't know if you know that show.
5309782	5312123	There's actually a little clip that's rolling around the internet.
5312223	5313783	We can play a little bit for you right now.
5315404	5315964	At least I can try.
5315984	5316364	Here we go.
5323044	5338635	See, it has an interesting sound to it, but to me it sounds a little more orchestra, whereas Akira Yamaoka felt a little more like dude in the basement banging random things together that made for an awesome soundtrack.
5338675	5339756	I don't know how to explain it.
5342083	5344646	This sounds like he's actually trying to emulate Yamoga.
5344666	5350633	Yeah, because it's got some of the same, like the mandolin in the background.
5351834	5354317	I really think he's trying to emulate Yamoga style.
5354337	5354718	Well, sure.
5354778	5355499	Everybody loved him.
5356259	5359463	It'll be interesting to see what this full thing looks like when it comes out.
5360104	5362166	Obviously, you can't tell from just a minute and a half clip.
5364190	5366076	Alright, that's going to do it for Rapid Fire News.
5366176	5372213	Let's move into some Twitter topics tonight and see what you guys are tweeting us at twitter.com slash OLR.
5374366	5393932	Tweet, tweet, tweet Oh, a few tweets tonight Let's see, Spazinator wants to give us an update on what's going on in the video marketplace Not too much new in terms of freebies to announce aside from a preview episode of An Idiot Abroad on both PSN and XBL What the hell is An Idiot Abroad?
5393972	5398494	I've never heard of that Surely that's not an anime Is that a reality show?
5400819	5401840	I've never heard of this before.
5401880	5403580	I'm Wikipedia-ing it right now.
5405481	5406542	An Idiot Abroad.
5407342	5412145	Let's see, an entertainment travel documentary on Sky One and Science Channel.
5414264	5416045	Starring Carl Plinkington.
5416525	5417886	And Ricky Jervis is in it too.
5417906	5419607	Well, that's pretty cool, I guess, if you're a fan of him.
5420967	5421748	An idiot abroad.
5423349	5423909	Let's see.
5423929	5425990	SSJ100Matt is tweeting us.
5426090	5428511	Resident hockey fan here with some game-related news.
5428951	5434534	A minor league hockey team celebrates SNES NHL 94 style.
5434554	5435635	And he gives us a link there.
5436455	5438936	And let's see here.
5439556	5440437	I guess, what is this?
5441849	5446031	I was playing on my old console Super Nintendo one day and I scored a spectacular goal.
5446091	5448332	And this is from one of the goaltenders of the Blazers.
5448872	5453394	Everyone just stopped and threw their sticks over their heads and I thought it was the funniest thing ever.
5453874	5464159	So it looks like when they actually scored a goal recently... They started waving their sticks over their heads just like they did in the game.
5464199	5464659	That's cute.
5467659	5468119	That's funny.
5468179	5468640	I like that.
5469240	5470521	That guy doesn't even have a stick.
5470601	5471081	Look at him.
5471942	5473663	What happened to that guy?
5473723	5474644	He lost his stick.
5474684	5476185	He's just waving his hands in the air.
5479025	5480606	I don't know why that's really funny, but it is.
5481566	5490330	And SSJ100Matt continues with another tweet saying, Also, two friends got me this awesome painting by 8-bit video game painter Adam Shub.
5490990	5493311	I guess is the name of the person that did that.
5493811	5495392	And I can't see the link that he put.
5495492	5496372	Oh, I see this one though.
5496452	5497773	Oh, is that like the Earthbound?
5498373	5501554	I get linked to a DeviantArt page called Square Painter.
5502034	5502514	That's kind of cool.
5502534	5505796	There's like a Ninja Gaiden picture and an Earthbound picture.
5505816	5506356	That's pretty rad.
5509486	5516932	Dark Tetsuya tweets us and says, on the topic of Daft Punk, any of you guys ever seen Interstellar 555 or Interstellar 45?
5516992	5520834	Freaking epic anime set to their Discovery album.
5521155	5524937	I've seen the one clip, like One More Time was a whole little anime thing.
5525017	5525598	They all are.
5525818	5527679	But I haven't seen the whole thing together.
5527699	5528660	I've only seen that one song.
5528880	5531402	It's all by the same, I don't remember, the anime artist.
5531462	5534204	It's the guy that did Galaxy Express and that kind of stuff.
5534704	5535945	But yeah, I've watched the whole thing.
5535965	5537206	I actually had the DVD at one point.
5538226	5539387	Might still have the DVD.
5539467	5540528	I don't know.
5540848	5541528	But yeah, I've watched it.
5541549	5542069	It's pretty awesome.
5542589	5542889	Gotcha.
5543950	5545571	Got a tweet as well from Leo Shen.
5546032	5550514	The NBC, Marvel vs. Capcom, of course, 3 final boss has been leaked.
5550995	5557259	And we get to a YouTube here that says Galactus boss fight in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5557319	5558540	That apparently is the final boss.
5559140	5561962	And there's this whole fighting going on on a TV.
5562903	5566686	This is probably very no-no that this is out here on the internet, but now it's out.
5567847	5568387	So there it is.
5568407	5569388	They're fighting Galactus.
5569548	5570368	That's the final boss.
5571429	5573331	He was awfully stunted for Galactus.
5574431	5575592	I think he's in the background.
5575732	5576133	Let me see.
5576153	5576873	Yep, here he comes.
5576933	5577313	Oh, yeah.
5578414	5578835	There you go.
5578855	5580656	Okay, that's cool.
5581597	5582537	So what you're fighting is Pinky.
5583178	5583438	Mm-hmm.
5584778	5585459	Thank you for watching!
5600871	5601991	I don't remember now, actually.
5602511	5603812	I know it was in Galactus.
5605932	5607273	And everyone keeps picking on Galactus.
5607353	5609533	All he wants is a sandwich made out of, you know, a planet.
5612814	5613194	Alright.
5614375	5618956	TigerClaw sent us some links, but sadly they are stories that are coming up later, so I gotta save those for a little later.
5619516	5620536	That does it for Twitter tonight.
5620617	5624157	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets in the future.
5624738	5626278	Get to those later on.
5627038	5628779	Alright, let's move on with some more stories.
5628939	5629239	Loki...
5629997	5636463	Yes, so this is kind of cool, I guess if you're either lazy or you are disabled.
5638685	5640166	For me, I'd say it's because I'm lazy.
5640846	5647953	But MLB 11, they are including a one-button association for disabled virtual athletes mode.
5648553	5652537	And basically what it will allow you to do is play the game using one button.
5654377	5668481	and it's going to have AI handling all the fielding and the player only needs to press one button in order to swing the bat or pitch and allows gamers who might not be able to throw a baseball in real life or wield a dual shock controller ease of play.
5669202	5670182	So that's pretty awesome.
5670962	5683307	Apparently, the mode was inspired by Hans Smith, a baseball superfan with cerebral palsy, whose limited mobility made it impossible for him to play a real baseball game as well as a video game as well.
5684187	5695651	And Sony San Diego added him to last year's MLB game as an avatar, and then this year they went one step further with the disability-friendly gameplay mode.
5697429	5698110	That's pretty sweet.
5698490	5699410	Well, that's kind of cool.
5699691	5701912	I like that they kind of did that, you know.
5703553	5705915	Do you get to play online in the one-button mode?
5706415	5706735	I don't know.
5706755	5711839	I can see people that don't need to be using that mode using that, but hopefully that's not the case.
5711859	5713680	Well, if you think about it, no, if you do that, just, you know.
5714560	5715141	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5744483	5773002	so there's a big big difference between that one handed mode alright well if you think maybe there should be more games like this that are easily accessible to those folks or maybe there's just a really cool idea you have for an indie game maybe this site is something you want to take a look at it's kind of a spin off of a site called Kickstarter which honestly I had never heard of until this project kind of came across my path 8bitfunding is the name of the site 8bitfunding.com
5773894	5775936	It's what they call crowdsourcing.
5776356	5782981	Basically, you can donate to different projects and you might get something or a perk in return.
5783481	5786664	So there might be these games that need help.
5787024	5789626	They need money to fund the games or what have you.
5790087	5798153	And if you buy into it, maybe with a certain amount, maybe they'll promise you 10% of the gross receipts.
5798773	5825030	or maybe you'll get a cameo in the game or maybe the developer will come over to your house or something like that or develop something for you in exchange um so kind of an interesting little thing is when i was first reading this i was like okay so this is basically like a paypal donation button donate to my game now what what is the big deal about this but it's kind of some of the perks that they're offering in fact i'm kind of looking at the site right now unfortunately a lot of these games have not really raised a whole lot of money uh
5825612	5827213	They did the same type of thing with this.
5827353	5832295	I think it was on the, not this 8-bit funding site, but the other one that was group sourcing.
5832375	5838478	It was for the Cthulhu, was it Cthulhu Saves the World or something like that?
5838558	5839278	Yeah, I remember that.
5839458	5845841	They were doing the PC version and having all these different things that you could donate and get a character in the game and stuff like that.
5846121	5847041	Right.
5847121	5854524	You know, I'm looking at some of these projects and all of them are looking for like $20,000, which, you know, I'm imagining must be the cost of a dev kit or to get the game online.
5854625	5854945	I don't know.
5855405	5856345	But let's see.
5856405	5860507	Like I notice the game that has the most money right now is The Boo Keeper.
5860927	5864048	$105 is how much they've raised towards their $20,000 goal.
5864329	5865409	But the site is still new.
5866009	5866589	So who knows?
5866930	5869150	I'm trying to look at some of the little like perks they offer here.
5869531	5871311	They're trying to get this in 86 days.
5871451	5874373	Oh, they have like a little video as well from the developer.
5874453	5875033	That's kind of neat.
5877056	5885593	and they actually will give a game for a $5 project or two games for $20 a thank you package for $50
5888660	5890301	Give Your Voice to a Character for $1000
5908173	5934661	uh trials and tribulations they go through 8bitfunding.com what I also noticed was here was a magazine was posted on here that they're trying to fund an actual magazine for a thousand dollars it's an indie gaming magazine kind of neat maybe we need to get some of these people on our show to hock their products who knows could be interesting I like hearing about new ideas all right so 8bitfunding.com let's move on to some more stories DarkSakura
5935217	5936838	How about something on Kid Icarus?
5937298	5937698	How about it?
5938278	5940519	Well, it's not going to be out until after E3.
5941599	5943079	Or Zelda, for that matter.
5943960	5958844	They're actually saying that, of course, we've mentioned earlier that neither of those are going to be launch titles for the 3DS, that they are going to be out early June, which is right after E3, so it's speculated.
5959364	5959865	I don't know, though.
5959885	5961966	When you said the news, I couldn't help but feel like this.
5977176	5979937	But it's kind of the news I think we were all expecting, honestly.
5979997	5981558	I mean, if the game wasn't coming out at launch.
5981758	5984179	I was convinced Kid Icarus was going to make it out at launch, though.
5984219	5986360	They made such a big deal out of that at E3.
5986821	5988021	So it's kind of, last year anyway.
5988281	5990002	So it's kind of shocking that it is delayed.
5990062	5990662	But again.
5991022	5992663	It's just teasing, Rob, teasing.
5992743	5994404	And you've got to make sure the game is great.
5994724	5995985	Don't release a mediocre game.
5996005	5996885	It's gaming foreplay.
5999026	6025989	I'm all for them taking more time to do it if they need the time to make the game great so it's just a bummer they didn't have anything done ready to go with the exception of I guess Nintendogs and what is it the submarine game or whatever that's true Pilotwings might be interesting I don't know though I didn't feel Pilotwings 64 the same way I did the original SNES version which is still one of my favorites I love Pilotwings on the SNES so there you go
6028504	6030146	Anyhow, Loki, what do you have for us?
6030186	6031788	The mailbag's coming up soon, by the way, you guys.
6031808	6034470	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and soon your calls.
6034991	6036192	You have to use the week and so much more.
6036332	6036573	Loki?
6037093	6040717	More disappointing congressmen coming from California.
6040837	6043340	I swear to God, it's just... What do we have?
6043520	6045402	Idiots working in Congress over here?
6045642	6046323	I didn't vote for them.
6046763	6046884	It's...
6047611	6051834	This time it's not Lee though, so it is a different Congressman.
6052095	6063764	Joe Baca, he introduced against legislation back in 2009 that required games to display labels of warnings between link of violent video games and aggressive behavior.
6064364	6068168	Now apparently he's come back and now he's trying to pitch a similar thing.
6070070	6073994	He's saying that he wants a warning to be put on these games.
6074014	6080320	So warning, excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior.
6081000	6089122	And it says, I guess the 2009 act failed to gain momentum, but he's now relabeled it the Video Game Health Labeling Act of 2011.
6089562	6096304	And it's basically the same act with the same goal, putting warning labels on games rated teen and above.
6097064	6106586	And apparently now, I guess the only difference this time around is that he's gained support of Virginia Congressman Frank Wolf.
6117788	6130175	Just as we warn smokers of health consequences of tobacco, we should warn parents and children about the growing scientific evidence demonstrating a relationship between violent video games and violent behavior.
6130795	6141038	As a parent and grandparent, I think it's important to have people know everything they can about the extremely violent nature of some of these games.
6142338	6145579	Which is great, because that's what's on the ESRB label.
6145919	6148080	It shows you what kind of content's in those games.
6149520	6150760	So you don't need to do this.
6151561	6152841	I don't understand what the point is.
6154681	6156222	But apparently they are...
6158700	6159382	Thanks for watching!
6169645	6170445	That's how I feel.
6171306	6171946	Sounds good to me.
6172986	6178969	Like, you know, I mean, if you're going to put warning labels on video games, you're going to put warnings on movies.
6178989	6181210	You're going to put warnings on sugary candy.
6181891	6184332	May cause your kid to have a short attention span.
6185012	6189634	If you, I mean, I'm sorry, but first off, violent video games don't affect everybody the same way.
6189775	6193176	And there hasn't been, there's been studies that go both ways with that.
6193196	6194657	There's nothing definitive about it.
6195305	6201848	And we already have a label on the box that shows what kind of content's in the game.
6202028	6202968	It shows if it's violent.
6202988	6203528	It shows if there's nudity.
6203548	6206769	And if you read the back of the box, you can get a pretty good idea, too.
6207010	6209190	You don't need another label saying that there's nudity.
6209210	6220995	If you're going to buy a game called Zombie Massacre 2011, the back of the box is probably going to indicate to you that it's probably pretty violent and that you will be massacring zombies in the game.
6221235	6222235	You're not suddenly going to get...
6224176	6227879	A game with puppets and rainbows and whatever.
6228379	6228799	Stupid.
6229079	6230160	Puppet Rainbow Massacre.
6232021	6232962	That would be a little bit different.
6232982	6234603	They did that in an episode of Angel.
6234743	6237705	I mean, I'm sorry, but isn't there like a budget to be balanced?
6238046	6239687	Aren't there jobs that need to be created?
6239707	6241448	Yeah, this stuff does cost money.
6241628	6245771	And why are these congressmen wasting time on this stuff?
6245911	6246471	Seriously.
6246491	6248753	Especially California congressmen.
6248773	6249673	There's a word for it.
6251134	6251795	Two words, actually.
6252495	6253216	Budget allocation.
6255407	6257489	Funding.
6257529	6265176	They're trying to get donations for their 2012 campaign by pleasing some moral superiority board?
6265776	6271581	It's the stuff like that that actually pulls in other funds for the different areas of...
6273294	6275535	The different committees and different stuff that they're trying to allocate money to.
6275555	6278955	That's why we have the big problems, because they need to go through and do a whole big audit.
6279295	6282696	And they need to have the audit done by someone not in government, but by an outside party.
6283336	6287377	So in other words, if this type of movement didn't exist, the committee might get folded?
6288958	6289398	Probably.
6289478	6290958	Then fold the fucking committee!
6291158	6293119	This is a waste of our goddamn time!
6293399	6294899	Everybody's goddamn time!
6295239	6295479	Agreed.
6297260	6301681	One more time, Congressman Joe Baca, I'm expressing my First Amendment right in telling you...
6302759	6303240	Whatever.
6303820	6304361	That's funny.
6304561	6305562	Joe Moron.
6305942	6307804	Shut the fuck up.
6307964	6308945	Thank you, Pendulet.
6310647	6313490	But I was funny because... Never mind.
6314971	6315332	Anyhow.
6317374	6320877	If that's the best thing that committee can come up with, then it deserves to be folded.
6323159	6323720	Moving on.
6325542	6325622	Ugh.
6326047	6327208	I can hear it in my head now.
6327268	6327749	You mad?
6328289	6329110	Yes, I am mad.
6329610	6330291	Alright, let me move on.
6330331	6330531	Sorry.
6331292	6333414	Sarian.net Remember that website?
6333434	6340640	That was the website where you could play action Sierra games, adventure games like King's Quest and all this stuff.
6340660	6341721	You could play it on your iPad.
6342021	6346145	And we were all sitting here going, just a matter of time before this thing gets shut down.
6346585	6348787	Yep, we are waiting for this thing to get shut down.
6349088	6349908	Guess what happened, guys?
6350709	6351610	It got shut down this week.
6351650	6352050	That's right.
6352871	6358534	And a letter from Activision's legal counsel got posted on the website for everybody to read.
6358634	6360796	And I liked how some of this email went.
6361476	6372624	While we appreciate your dedication to the Sierra Classic Library and understand that you are a fan of these games, Activision has not authorized the development or distribution of these games via your website.
6373024	6380489	Accordingly, we must demand that you immediately cease any further distribution or exploitation, I like that word, of the Sierra games on your website.
6381089	6386974	Now, as much as you want to paint Activision as the big bad evil people, I don't know.
6386994	6388515	They kind of do have a point.
6388675	6392198	I mean, it is their games and this whole thing, posting them public, you know.
6393298	6396501	But if you're not going to do anything with it, then what the hell are you doing?
6397554	6397854	and so on.
6415767	6422855	There is another interesting development that happened this week that's worth mentioning, and that is that it wasn't totally shut down after the cease and desist.
6423616	6430002	It looks like Activision ended up giving Sarian approval to continue running in a limited capacity.
6430723	6437050	Sarian.net is now able to publish the first game of any series in its multiplayer HTML5 form.
6438291	6441894	So I guess this whole new little way of doing it is available.
6442334	6446737	However, the iPad versions are no longer there because they might want to develop it sometimes.
6447278	6452642	And Activision has allowed at least that, which I think is somewhat generous.
6453162	6455204	There are also links to buy the games on Steam.
6455824	6457706	That's free advertising for retro titles.
6458586	6458827	It is.
6459347	6462669	So, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like as much as you want to hate Activision...
6464030	6492647	you can't say they're not doing anything with this you are able to buy the games legitimately out there somewhere so I don't know it's a little bit hard for me to get mad at Activision for cease and desisting somebody trying to give that away for free it does pain me that Activision continues to do nothing new in this genre but I guess at least we always have the silver lining which by the way episode 3 was delayed but it will be coming out when it's ready
6493362	6494182	I see what you did there.
6494402	6494822	That's right.
6495682	6496803	Let's go to the mailbag.
6500423	6504164	Mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com is where you can send us your emails every week.
6504704	6507685	And I got to say, guys, the email bag is still in a pretty sad state.
6507745	6511286	We got one email this week and it's not signed.
6511426	6517407	So I'll just say it's from Adam H. Wanting us to talk about the PSP2 or the NGP.
6518767	6521088	and linking us to the blog where we could talk about that.
6521588	6524010	Well, I think we did go over pretty much the big stuff.
6524030	6524350	That's right.
6524370	6530212	We did go over the big stuff in part A. I will give the courtesy of looking at this website here and see if there's anything we didn't cover because you never know.
6530232	6532774	There might be little stuff that falls through the crack or whatever.
6533754	6534194	Let's see.
6535555	6535775	Nope.
6535795	6536375	Screenshots.
6536415	6537016	Got those.
6537656	6538656	Uncharted Portable.
6538776	6540497	Yeah.
6540517	6543379	5-inch organic light-emitting display.
6543579	6544439	We already mentioned that.
6544719	6546080	Or did you use the word organic?
6546100	6546180	Yeah.
6546600	6547701	I did OLED.
6547921	6548201	Okay.
6549022	6550323	Sixaxis is in it.
6550403	6551063	GPS.
6552104	6553545	Yeah, I think we covered all this, dude.
6553565	6553886	Sorry.
6554426	6555026	But, hey.
6555487	6556628	There's some nice little pictures.
6556688	6558109	I like the whole back touchpad.
6558149	6560611	Looks kind of funny with all the little PlayStation symbols over and over.
6562132	6564794	So, yes, our mailbag is in kind of a sad state tonight, I'm sorry to say.
6566155	6568656	Mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com if you want to help us out for future weeks.
6568676	6570978	It'll fold your laundry, wash the cat.
6571258	6571619	That's right.
6572139	6574581	So, meanwhile, let's get into some FUs, some angst.
6589693	6591554	I have three FUs, and I love you.
6593095	6595377	My FUs... Aw, I love you too!
6595817	6600460	My FU goes to being sick, because I hate it.
6600860	6607945	My second FU goes to the CW for playing Supernatural by week, because damn it, I've been waiting for this damn episode.
6609190	6611491	It's like, stop teasing me.
6612191	6623876	And then F you to all of the people in the torrent community who decided to capitalize on the fact that certain people don't actually watch active TV and download the episodes as a torrent and decide to put out a virus torrent.
6625245	6634191	Which thankfully, the moment you see the Windows error, you know, codec thing, you have to stop it before it goes to whatever site to update the codec.
6634331	6636953	So it doesn't, you know, accidentally virus you.
6637393	6638454	So yeah, stupid.
6638574	6641636	And my love goes to Dan, because he's been taking good care of me.
6642977	6643137	Aww.
6643217	6643497	Hey.
6643577	6647860	You're a little sick there, Rob.
6647940	6649922	Yeah, I mean, I think I caught whatever you guys have.
6649942	6650742	Rob's got our plague.
6650762	6651463	Alright.
6652263	6653304	Loki, you have an FU of the week.
6655203	6663572	mainly just to Xbox 360s being so delicate and fragile that they'll break within five minutes.
6663832	6665093	What, did you drop one?
6665393	6666414	I didn't drop one.
6666434	6667676	I didn't have to drop one.
6667696	6668517	I turned it on.
6669097	6674563	And then I switched the monitor resolution and it went and died.
6675844	6680971	So no, the original consoles, man, I swear, if you have a Xenon console, it's gonna die.
6681231	6684075	It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.
6689124	6690244	I don't have a lot of FUs.
6690404	6692345	Things are relatively well right now.
6692445	6695405	So I'll just say FU to money or lack thereof.
6695425	6696285	Never having enough of it.
6697806	6700386	FU to Disneyland being crowded yesterday.
6700486	6701927	That's never fun to go on a crowded day.
6702327	6703987	Everybody else needs to go somewhere else when I'm there.
6704627	6707828	And I guess FU to the fact that I didn't get to spend enough time there.
6707848	6709308	It really was just like a fast, fast trip.
6709428	6711669	So yeah, that's really it.
6713263	6714224	Otherwise, things are pretty good.
6714624	6717767	If those are my FUs, then things are pretty well in my world.
6718487	6719188	Let's move on.
6719428	6720529	A couple more stories for you guys.
6720549	6725733	And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
6726133	6730517	Please make sure before you call us, echo 123 if you are on Skype.
6730557	6732418	You must, must, must test yourself first.
6732798	6736561	I think even Skype puts in there now, click this button to make a test call.
6736882	6738523	You need to do that before you go on the radio.
6738823	6740604	Yes, listen to the nice lady that says, you know,
6741405	6744568	Hello, welcome to the Skype call testing service.
6744948	6747270	You need to hear her before you hear us, so please do that now.
6747910	6749351	But if you're using the phone, that's easy.
6749592	6750492	You can just pick it up and call.
6750833	6752534	All right, but we're not taking the calls just yet.
6752594	6754135	We got a couple more stories for you first.
6754215	6754475	Loki.
6755756	6762382	One other thing that was announced during the PlayStation conference, and it wasn't necessarily the PlayStation phone...
6762922	6764443	It was the PlayStation Suite.
6764643	6769006	And what the PlayStation Suite is, is actually a couple things.
6769106	6775270	First off, it's going to be a PlayStation store that's going to be available for Android phones.
6776710	6782214	They'll allow you to purchase different PlayStation games.
6782654	6783515	Thanks for watching!
6809181	6814789	and of course some of the games that they're mentioning that are going to be available are actually early PlayStation 1 games.
6815070	6820418	Cold Borders 2, Syphon Filter and Rallycross, Wild Arms and Medieval.
6821437	6821977	Oh, my bad.
6852116	6853237	or the Android iOS.
6853457	6857519	Because we can't really say it's just for phones now since they do have tablets now with the Android iOS.
6857679	6861342	Oh, I remember something about this is all going to tie into the NGP as well too, right?
6861802	6870227	Yeah, so it's a way to get PlayStation content out there on more than just the PlayStation phone.
6871937	6873358	Oh, neat.
6873918	6883745	But honestly though, I mean, just looking at, unless you have that PlayStation phone, I can imagine this is going to suck just because, I mean, just look at the controls.
6883826	6886127	It takes up like so much screen space.
6886227	6886948	It's just ridiculous.
6886968	6888589	Yeah, touch controls are ridiculous too.
6888689	6889970	You need tangible buttons.
6890450	6891951	Forget it otherwise, honestly.
6892212	6892372	Yeah.
6893032	6895354	That's one thing we've learned from iPhone gaming.
6895454	6897875	Very few iPhone games really, really work.
6898275	6900237	They have to be designed for that touch.
6900597	6904319	Things like Cut the Rope work because it's very easy.
6904459	6908982	Things like, I guess, Angry Birds, although I've never played it, work because it's based around the touch controls.
6909423	6914806	Things like a port of Mega Man fail because you need tangible controls in order to be able to play it.
6915703	6918984	I will say that Escaluda worked very well with touch controls.
6919084	6919404	Really?
6919704	6921865	Yeah, but that's because it has auto-fire and stuff.
6922705	6923645	I did it without auto-fire.
6923865	6924085	Really?
6924105	6924986	It actually plays really well.
6925266	6927306	And Mushihime-sama was really fun.
6928547	6928907	I don't know.
6929027	6930947	I need tangible buttons.
6931387	6933268	I thought that was all Sony's thing with the move.
6933688	6934608	Don't you like buttons?
6936389	6936669	Whatever.
6938061	6947487	All right, one more story for you guys before the Skype line tonight, and it has to do with World of Warcraft, but it's kind of an interesting one because you know where WoW goes, other MMOs tend to follow.
6947887	6948968	This is kind of interesting.
6949428	6952751	WoW has gone after gold sellers in a whole new way.
6953351	6954552	Paypal Paypal Paypal Paypal
6968488	6996244	very interesting because you know these places are in other countries and so forth and they accept PayPal as a method of payment which you know a lot of folks don't want to give companies well folks shouldn't be using these fucking things in the first place but on the other hand you know when they do use them they don't want to use their real credit card info so they'll often use PayPal well now they've kind of cut off that bridge so I think that's kind of cool that they did that that was a smart way to go about doing it so yeah that's how they're going after it cut out the middleman
6998407	7016293	and they could kind of strong arm PayPal too because I'm pretty sure they take PayPal as a method of payment for the game itself so they could tell PayPal either do this or we're going to stop taking your thing as a form of payment you know they could kind of strong arm them like that I'm not saying that's what they did but I could imagine that being part of the conversation
7017054	7018836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7030979	7038266	No, but I mean, I think it's convenient to have it there if you want to get a little thing here or there.
7038487	7046074	And certainly, you pay $10 and get 1,200 points, which I bought tons of stuff with my points.
7046855	7053822	So I think that they need to be a little bit more judicious with what they will and won't accept via PayPal.
7053842	7053922	Yeah.
7054833	7055233	I heart the guild.
7080512	7081793	Oh yeah, because they've helped you out.
7081913	7082274	Yeah, I know.
7082334	7082995	Find a guild.
7083035	7084576	You don't need to buy gold.
7084696	7085898	Find a guild of nice people.
7085918	7086999	And don't steal from your guild.
7087539	7088620	Yeah, don't steal from your guild.
7089862	7095067	If you're in the game to just profit profit and steal everything from your guild, then you're in the game for the wrong reasons.
7095788	7098330	Play the auction house game if money making is what you want.
7099371	7101313	Buy out a certain item and then sell it for triple.
7101353	7101674	I don't know.
7102688	7104830	All right, let's open up the Skype line right now.
7104850	7108513	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7108553	7109373	The phones are open.
7109734	7111876	Take your calls on any topic we've talked about tonight.
7111916	7113757	Maybe you have a comment on the NGP itself.
7113817	7114878	Maybe you want to talk 3DS.
7115559	7119722	Maybe you want to talk about that whole PS3 hacking mess or something we haven't brought up yet.
7120122	7121764	Whatever you want to talk about, the phones are open.
7121784	7127048	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
7127508	7130631	While we wait for those calls to come in, Loki, do you have any quick last minute stories for us?
7133169	7134070	No, not really.
7134270	7135130	Well, not yet.
7136090	7142512	Actually, that Galactus video, that was someone that was playing on a pirated Xbox 360 version.
7142853	7144133	Naughty, naughty.
7144773	7145674	Naughty, naughty.
7146514	7148655	Because you can see the 360 in the background there.
7148975	7149455	Uh-oh.
7151745	7154587	Let's see, some other fun stuff we could talk about here.
7157128	7158648	This is kind of neat, we haven't mentioned this yet.
7159008	7166432	Platinum's new game that's coming out, Max Anarchy, well at least that's how it's known in other places, is coming over as Anarchy Reigns.
7166792	7174015	It's kind of an MMO brawler game, and it also features the main character from Mad World, but in full color this time.
7174235	7177136	And he's actually kind of in all the trailers and stuff.
7177296	7178357	Honestly though, I kind of...
7179497	7180817	I kind of like him better black and white.
7181778	7184339	He doesn't look that cool when he's non-black and white.
7185279	7185579	I don't know.
7185679	7186519	That's just my opinion.
7186880	7189060	All right, let's go to the phones and take some calls.
7189120	7190161	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7190181	7190541	Who's this?
7191581	7193122	Hi, this is Spazinator.
7193182	7193822	Hey, Spazinator.
7193842	7194482	What's on your mind, buddy?
7195983	7203465	Well, since it's pretty much the topic of the night, I just want to chime in on the NGP or whatever it's called.
7203585	7204566	Whatever they end up calling it.
7204606	7204806	Sure.
7204846	7205386	What are your thoughts?
7206741	7218909	Well, even though some people within the Dialgames community would like to pick me as a Sony fanboy, I'm a little hesitant to even consider getting the NGP.
7221211	7233959	Although the system does sound nice on paper, but the truth is, even with my PSP, I very rarely touch it.
7234780	7234920	And
7236356	7241217	Hell, nowadays, I only use it for downloading podcasts and whatnot, and that's about it.
7241657	7242297	Let me back up.
7242497	7244718	Why did you abandon your PSP?
7244798	7253320	Was it a lack of the games that you have to play, or what caused you, you think, to abandon... Or, I don't know, are you a DS player now, or what caused you to abandon the PSP?
7254380	7257981	Well, I was a DS player for a while, too.
7258181	7263342	I had both systems, but truth be told, you know, there's more games on...
7264520	7268762	The PS3 and the 360 that I would much rather play.
7271924	7276187	For example, on the 360, I constantly play Game Room.
7276687	7281890	And on PS3, I play a lot of Super Stardust, HD, so on and so forth.
7282750	7289294	And between the two main consoles, there's more games on there that I'm interested in as opposed to handhelds.
7289734	7294157	And considering that I'm on the budget, I have to watch...
7295569	7300473	How much I spend on games and don't really have enough money to go all the way around.
7300593	7311121	I would rather play my games on consoles as opposed to handhelds because really, isn't the point of handhelds to go out and buy a Play-Doh when you're not at home?
7311481	7314804	And I'm usually home pretty much 24-7.
7319677	7333902	Well, at first, yeah, I did play my PSP a lot initially, playing out like the Darkstalkers games and the ports of PS2 games, but I just generally found myself playing the system less and less.
7334375	7336696	So it's kind of the price that freaks you out, too, though.
7336776	7343357	I mean, because you mentioned that you have a very limited budget, kind of like I mentioned earlier.
7343617	7350479	There's just certain people, especially in this economy, this day and age, that don't have a lot of the extra money, and they kind of know this is going to be expensive.
7350559	7354220	So is it kind of like the price that scares you, too?
7354740	7356741	Yeah, basically, in a nutshell, yeah.
7356761	7357981	I live under $800 a month.
7358001	7358161	Wow.
7358201	7359281	And that basically...
7362489	7375499	That basically, that $800 a month not even has to go towards rent, food, my time order bill, so on and so forth.
7375519	7377401	There's not a lot of room for entertainment there.
7378341	7379742	Yeah.
7379782	7389190	Granted, I can manage to keep my expenses low because the cost of living in Buffalo, New York is pretty low, but still, even with that, that leaves me with...
7391576	7396863	roughly $200 a month that if I'm lucky I'm able to save and whatnot.
7397463	7397804	In fact,
7398685	7403189	It took me like a year just to save up for this netbook that I just recently got.
7404630	7409474	Let me ask you this, though, because obviously the system is expensive.
7410554	7416719	Do you think you would use or try to save up anyway for one of the competitors to a PSP2?
7416759	7425386	Is there something that maybe interests you more about the 3DS or maybe even the iPad, you could say, as a competitor of the NGP, whatever it's called?
7425986	7432592	Is there either of those that maybe interest you more that you would save up for or no, I'm not interested in this wave of technology at all?
7433172	7439738	It's kind of hard to say just now because obviously all those systems aren't quite out yet.
7440919	7452028	If I do consider going out and buying any handheld whatsoever, whether it be 3DS or PSP2 or what have you, I would have to wait like...
7453669	7458252	Just to pull a figure out, but let's say a year, year and a half.
7458933	7464496	Wait to see what comes up for whatever system and see if those games would interest me.
7465097	7467498	Then maybe, yeah, I'll consider getting them.
7467598	7475864	But if nothing of interest comes up for me, like at least bare minimum, I don't know, 15 games at least.
7477111	7479273	Just say forget it.
7480194	7484319	So in other words, it's the games that are on the system that are going to make it or break it for you.
7485240	7492588	Yeah, and they would have to be like exclusive games, not found on the home systems.
7493809	7495311	No ports of any kind.
7495951	7497994	I mean, truly exclusive stuff or...
7500430	7526390	I hear you buddy it's you know our golden rule of gaming a system is only as good as the games that are on it so I think it's a smart approach for you know a budget gamer to wait and see you know let the people that have more disposable income kind of beta test everything for you I suppose so Spazinator I gotta let you go to get more calls but thank you as always and who knows maybe you'll win a contest at a local store maybe win one of these guys for free I'll be hoping for you alright have a good one buddy
7527662	7532868	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR is our number or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
7533949	7536812	SSJ100Matt agrees in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
7536832	7537953	The price will be key.
7538554	7541837	Bonds006 says, I am PC till death.
7542598	7547964	That's an interesting way of looking at it, especially from the whole budget perspective is that, well, I have this PC anyway.
7549039	7551121	There's tons and tons of games available on PC.
7551201	7554664	Why even bother with a handheld or even a console?
7555684	7557266	I've got everything I need right in my PC.
7557646	7559548	That's the way a lot of people look at it, surprisingly enough.
7559568	7563010	877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
7563030	7564952	Do we have any other last-minute stories, Loki, to hold us over?
7564972	7566994	Do we get more ringing rings?
7569356	7571758	Let's just see here what I've got here.
7572858	7574180	What can you pull out of your butt, Loki?
7574220	7575421	What can I pull out of my butt?
7579922	7584070	I don't want to know what Loki can pull out of his butt.
7584170	7586194	I meant like story-wise.
7587316	7589220	Not actual.
7589721	7589941	Yes.
7591786	7593087	There wasn't a whole lot, actually.
7593227	7598111	It's funny, this week I was surprised that there wasn't a whole lot of news other than the PSP stuff.
7598131	7600853	Sure, other than that big press conference, that's really it, I guess.
7601133	7605336	It was just kind of like, wow, isn't that NGP awesome?
7605876	7608158	It's so awesome.
7608798	7610159	I wonder how much it's going to be.
7610279	7612321	And then 3DS was like,
7613334	7614475	Anyone remember about me?
7615415	7619857	Oh, I think by the time the 3DS comes out, that will change quite a bit.
7621958	7622698	Oh, we got another call.
7622878	7623319	You're saved.
7623419	7624619	You can find something else for after this.
7624659	7625540	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7625560	7625900	Who's this?
7628841	7629381	Well, hey!
7629461	7630382	I haven't heard from you in a while.
7630402	7632763	How are you doing?
7633123	7633944	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
7635384	7636365	Let's hear it.
7641803	7643764	but it's gotten a lot of controversy.
7644164	7646486	I played Gal Gun for the Xbox 360.
7647326	7649247	Gal Gun, okay, okay.
7649267	7649907	Set the stage.
7649968	7651468	What type of game is Gal Gun?
7653069	7657151	Gal Gun is a very perverted shooter.
7657552	7660233	It's kind of like a dating sim shooter, I should say.
7660473	7661914	All dating sims should be shooters.
7662414	7663595	Okay.
7663895	7665056	I'm interested so far.
7666437	7670639	So, it's gotten a lot of controversy because Microsoft
7672032	7675414	I posted a video in the chat room.
7675434	7679377	There's a lot of panty shots and a lot of questionable material in it.
7680437	7684900	So a friend of mine has a Japanese 360, so he bought it.
7686241	7690384	And we played it, and I felt immediately dirty afterwards.
7694275	7695956	You spray your love on them, by the way.
7700198	7701799	This game looks disgusting.
7702099	7704880	This looks like Elebits, but with girls.
7705881	7706761	Little school girls.
7708622	7710323	I'm sure they're all 18 or over, I'm sure.
7710363	7711964	Yeah, of course, of course.
7712084	7718107	And you also get to shoot teachers and all that, so... This looks like Elebits.
7718187	7719147	Is this like Elebits?
7719767	7720588	Remember that game on the Wii?
7722476	7724457	Well, you know what the funny thing when you mention that is?
7724477	7733342	The whole game has the feeling of a Wii game that was rejected, but it was put out on the 360.
7733803	7734523	They wouldn't give up.
7734883	7740426	Alright, so usually games like this end up being crappy, and you said you felt dirty afterwards.
7740666	7742267	Was she tied up by a plant?
7742367	7743288	What the hell was that?
7743308	7744008	Tentacles!
7745389	7747370	There's a boss battle in it.
7747410	7748831	Well, the whole thing is centered around
7749890	7752731	When you start the game, you have to choose a girl that you're interested in.
7753251	7757692	Now the whole thing is you're trying to go through your high school and all that to try to get with this girl.
7758592	7765134	And you have to go through all these women who are going after you, hitting you with postcards, fans, you know, typical anime stuff.
7765634	7767175	Oh my goodness, postcards.
7768255	7769575	He might get a paper cut.
7770536	7770816	Yeah.
7771656	7779598	So what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to use a gun that shoots pheromones at the teenage girls
7780359	7782781	that makes them drop down in ecstasy.
7783521	7784722	So it's like your love gun.
7785843	7786804	Yeah, it's a love gun.
7787104	7787424	I see.
7787624	7795250	And you know, there's a special mode where you can zero in on a girl and shoot her at specific parts of her body.
7795350	7797691	So there's like a Fallout 3 mode?
7799012	7800754	Yeah, there is.
7800814	7808319	And you know, there'll be parts where she'll try to stop you if you're zeroing in on certain things and
7808618	7811380	Are you allowed to shoot these girls in the butt or do they not like that?
7811940	7813121	Yes, you can shoot them in the butt.
7813241	7819105	And you know, it's funny because the game is so dynamic that different girls have different hot spots, I should say.
7822347	7826250	Where you get an ecstasy bonus, as it's called.
7829110	7829610	It's both.
7829770	7831090	It's both.
7831211	7837093	It's essentially both because it's just so fucked up.
7837113	7837993	And you know what?
7838293	7839434	I was looking at it.
7840134	7843836	The people who made this game made a lot of kids' games.
7843876	7845156	They made, you know, the X-Men Zero series.
7845176	7845876	They actually made Mega Man 9 and 10.
7845916	7846317	Yeah, I guess so.
7846337	7847817	But, you know, the whole thing is, you know, it's very...
7857731	7858152	Ridiculous.
7858192	7862438	And you know, it's kind of tough to play because it's a dating sim and it's all in Japanese.
7862458	7864621	There's no English and it's never going to come in America.
7864661	7869067	So we're kind of guessing through the whole thing.
7869087	7872352	There's a lot of mini-games and bonus stages that are ridiculous, but
7873157	7873877	Wait, was that sheep?
7873937	7875258	What the fuck?
7912331	7914653	Loki, I think you need to bring a copy of this to the show one night.
7914713	7916214	Come on, it's episode 400 next week.
7916234	7916734	What do you say?
7918115	7922097	You need to import one of these real quick and get it over here to the show.
7923138	7923959	Expedite the shipping.
7925680	7926640	Alright, so anyhow.
7929482	7932124	That's bad, you know, I had to take a long bath after this just to
7934287	7941450	I'm sure those girls have to take a long bath too to wash what they got off I'm watching them shoot the teachers I want this game I totally want this game I totally think you should get a game
7950248	7950568	All right.
7950969	7954911	Thank you for the call, Matt, and bringing this game into our lives.
7955171	7955652	Take care, buddy.
7955912	7956132	Bye.
7957713	7957893	Oops.
7958113	7958473	I missed.
7958533	7958693	Oops.
7958734	7959754	I accidentally hung up on him early.
7959794	7960275	Sorry, Matt.
7960395	7960835	Didn't mean to.
7961355	7961635	All right.
7961655	7964517	1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange National Radio.
7964557	7965938	Akuma JP says, just kidding.
7965998	7966959	I have seen it.
7968100	7968640	That's funny.
7969180	7970921	It does totally look like a rejected Wii game.
7971522	7971902	All right.
7972442	7974063	We got time for a couple more calls, I suppose.
7976625	7978046	I don't know if you had another story for us, Loki?
7978066	7978146	Okay.
7978937	7994038	uh just real quick stuff uh no Kid Icarus or Zelda until after E3 yeah DarkSakura did report on that you were probably playing Grand Theft Auto no I wasn't playing Grand Theft Auto you were playing Gal Gun I was not playing Gal Gun um
7996195	7997536	Of course, let's see here.
7998117	8005983	Seriously, we have like, Atlas is bringing out Divinity 2, the Dragon Knight Saga, which is kind of an update to Divinity 2 with all the extra bonuses.
8006003	8009807	That's coming out in May or April.
8010407	8014791	By the way, there was some chatter earlier that accused me of never listening to Loki.
8015251	8017813	I just want to point out it's been proven it goes both ways.
8018454	8019535	Oh, I never listen to any of them.
8022657	8023778	It's called multitasking.
8023798	8030403	That's how we do this live show where we interact with the chat room, talk to each other, and take calls like the call we have on the line right now.
8030463	8031344	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8031364	8031704	Who's this?
8031724	8036527	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
8036567	8037408	Hey, this is excellent.
8037448	8038429	Hi, how are you, buddy?
8040478	8041098	Doing good.
8041258	8044119	I don't know what to say now.
8044219	8046439	I'm flabbergasted compared to that last caller.
8046459	8048960	Now it's just a one-up that I don't know if I can do that.
8050440	8052800	You're becoming like the Ranma of the new year.
8052860	8054241	You're getting on the show every week.
8054921	8055521	That's interesting.
8055561	8058341	But hey, if no one else is calling in... No, I try not to.
8060602	8065003	I don't try to call unless one, you need to call, or two, I have something to call in about.
8065083	8065343	All right.
8065383	8066683	Well, what does it happen to be tonight?
8066783	8067123	One or two?
8070141	8071163	Uh, two actually.
8071283	8072784	Alright, what do you have to talk about today?
8072804	8073906	I want to talk about the, uh, next gen.
8074046	8074567	Yes, please.
8074647	8075768	A lot of people talking about that today.
8075788	8078231	Yeah, the fact that, I think the price point's even scaring me.
8078431	8079052	I like what they...
8080606	8106804	Well, I was going to say, a lot of the things I liked when I saw, when I was watching the coverage as it came out, and I liked a little bit that I saw, and the fact that I could actually have a handheld that plays quality games of that of, like, the PS3, would be absolutely amazing, but the price point, the fact that I know it's going to come out, it's going to be like, oh, it's $799 or $800, so that's what's going to scare me more than anything.
8106844	8107425	That one would be like...
8107965	8113569	Okay, I'm going to have to put that on the back burner for like three years before getting in and trying to catch up with everybody else.
8114270	8116371	It will never sell if it's over $500.
8118533	8122676	Sorry, this is the perfect time for us to kind of take a step back.
8123056	8127079	Let's hop in the time machine and go back to five years ago, 2006.
8127259	8129000	You ready?
8129601	8133163	Back in 2006, it was the Sony E3 press conference.
8133203	8133483	You ready?
8133523	8133904	Here you go.
8135305	8144573	Kaz Harai Ridge Racer The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change and the consumers are ready.
8145814	8150078	Genji 2 is an action game which is based on Japanese history.
8150558	8161808	Ridge Racer Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.
8162566	8164847	So here's this giant enemy crab.
8165447	8166907	Ridge Racer.
8167988	8171809	And you attack its weak point for massive damage.
8172089	8173009	It's Ridge Racer.
8174229	8175670	Ridge Racer.
8175830	8178510	PlayStation 3 will retail for 599 US dollars, 599 US dollars, 599 US dollars.
8178530	8179031	Giant enemy crab.
8179051	8179751	599, 599, 599 US dollars.
8179771	8180371	It's Ridge Racer.
8192205	8194126	Ridge Racer Ridge Racer
8217376	8217896	Let's see here.
8218016	8230619	Ridge Racer for the Xbox was the same as Ridge Racer 7, was the same as Ridge Racer on the PSP, was the same as Ridge Racer on... Well, actually, the PSP version was like 4.
8232200	8236201	But the 3DS version is basically the same as Ridge Racer 7 and Ridge Racer 6.
8237381	8239641	They're not even putting any new effort into it.
8239661	8241922	It's like, eh, let's put the game over.
8244204	8244604	New cars?
8244724	8244984	Nah.
8245204	8246065	Let's port the game over.
8246285	8249526	Exometer Charm thinks that'll cost 599 US crabs.
8251766	8251966	Alright.
8251986	8254007	Those are historically accurate crabs.
8254087	8255487	Alright, I'm sorry, X-Link.
8255507	8257048	We're getting away from what you wanted to talk about.
8260409	8261209	Did he hang... X-Link?
8261229	8262089	No, no, it's better right.
8262109	8271152	I'm not going to keep it too long because it sounds like our connection is getting pretty bad here, so... Uh, well, so... No, I just wanted to say that, though, because, you know, a lot of people, you know, like, I'm in between jobs right now.
8271272	8272533	I don't have $599 to spend.
8276067	8280810	I do have a job and I don't have $599 US dollars to spend.
8281590	8284912	I'm a little freaked out.
8285252	8287873	This thing better blow me if it's going to be that much money.
8287993	8290775	I better just do more than that.
8291695	8292276	My God.
8293596	8295858	This thing better come with a love gun or something.
8295938	8296378	I don't know.
8298490	8305540	Alright, if they port Gal Gun to the NGP, yeah, I want it to talk dirty to me for $590.
8307102	8311088	If there's a Gal Gun on the NGP, then I might be able to be talked into it.
8311248	8311569	I don't know.
8313476	8339369	this is going to be a fun year nonetheless for E3 and it's going to be a lot of fun because this is going to be probably the year of let's see who won the up to and what category and what area so yeah this is going to be a lot of fun is he shooting his love pheromones into that plant's mouth alright X-Link I'm sorry they're still fascinated with Gal Gun so I gotta let you go but have a good night and thanks for calling no problem
8342751	8344992	Oh my god, poor Inks fall on her from Ragnarok.
8345212	8346253	It's Gal Gun!
8346653	8348134	Gal Gun!
8351615	8353716	Now everybody in chat's just being dirty.
8354437	8355437	You're all being dirty.
8356057	8359359	SSJ100Matt says, Fleshlight attachment coming in June 2012.
8359879	8362220	Well, since you all are being dirty, let me bring this up.
8362300	8362861	Have you, um...
8363820	8371346	Have you all heard of that show, My Strange Obsession, that's on TLC, the network that brings you hoarders and intervention?
8371366	8374308	If it's got midgets or multiple kids, it's on our network.
8375390	8381235	TLC now has the show My Strange Obsession where they like to show things like there was the chick that ate couch material.
8381335	8381555	Yes.
8381715	8383316	She had to eat the foam inside couches.
8383877	8385378	A chick that slept with her blow dryer.
8385418	8385778	Saw that.
8386118	8393985	Well, this week, or maybe it was this last week, I don't know, they are going to have a guy who is infatuated with his real doll.
8394965	8398847	his love doll that believes he is married to it or something like that.
8398907	8400168	I don't know what the deal was.
8400308	8405030	It was something like he treats the doll like it's a real person and sleeps with it at night.
8405170	8406171	Wasn't that a movie?
8407051	8408752	This is real life, apparently.
8408952	8410413	This is not like Weekend at Bernie's.
8410433	8411053	This is the real deal.
8411073	8411413	No, it wasn't.
8411573	8415315	They had a, remember it was with, I don't remember the guy's name.
8415415	8417116	Nah, I think I know which one.
8417396	8420517	Was that Simone about the virtual chick that comes to life?
8420737	8421518	No, no, no, no.
8421538	8423439	De Niro was in that, but that movie went straight to video.
8423679	8423779	Oh.
8424011	8428892	No, there was a movie about this guy who had a love doll or something like that.
8429592	8434373	And it was him and the whole town kind of pretended it was real.
8435914	8436574	For no reason.
8436694	8438454	That sounds like a dumbass movie.
8438494	8439635	One of those fucking artsy films.
8439655	8442355	I don't know.
8442375	8444096	It was one of those things I was like, really?
8444436	8445576	I'm not going to go see that.
8446519	8447640	Something the wife made you watch?
8447961	8449683	Oh, I forgot to mention!
8450143	8450624	Oh my god.
8451865	8453648	Gaming Week, totally forgot.
8455670	8461517	This week we had this kind of a kickoff for the 2011 year type thing.
8461557	8462098	They do like a
8463827	8468210	People from different branches out and stuff, and they're doing these team-building events and stuff like that.
8468330	8470691	From Salacious Pop, Lance and the Real Girl.
8470931	8471671	Yes, that's it.
8471711	8472032	Thank you.
8472972	8475473	Anyways, because I'm too lazy to look that up.
8475894	8483778	So they had a bunch of Connect Adventure games that we were competing in teams for high scores, and we win stuff.
8485239	8486119	And I'd like to say...
8487600	8491902	That two out of the three days, we kicked the crap out of everybody.
8492422	8499445	The third day, or actually I should say the first day, we would have won had we played together, both myself and my co-worker.
8500265	8503446	Instead, we were on separate teams with other people, which is why we lost.
8503546	8507468	But we won like $80 worth of movie passes.
8509173	8511995	Nice, what movie are you taking me to?
8512015	8523443	Well, we don't go to see movies very often, so when we do go, we're going to get popcorn, hot dogs, $60 in bulk candy.
8523964	8527226	It's just a matter of time before your kid's going to want to go see every Disney movie.
8527486	8529708	I mean, maybe a couple years, but still.
8529748	8530248	Yeah, a couple years.
8531869	8534091	I just thought it was funny that we kicked the crap out of you.
8534111	8535652	Well, yeah, you're the video game team.
8535672	8537093	You're supposed to kick the crap out of them.
8538334	8538594	All right.
8538674	8539114	It was awesome.
8539455	8541135	Well, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
8541175	8542356	Thank you guys who got through.
8542396	8547778	If you didn't get through, you can always email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
8547838	8549979	But we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show tonight.
8550559	8554160	It's a little early, but I guess it wasn't outside of the NGP.
8554861	8555801	Not a whole lot to say.
8556221	8558482	So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
8558722	8559983	We can just have an extra long afterbirth.
8560523	8561824	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
8565734	8569619	Alright, and by the way, the chat room is yelling it's actually Lars and the real girl, not Lance.
8569899	8572702	And SalaciousPop says, it's actually really good, thank you very much.
8573343	8574324	I heard it was actually good.
8574364	8574885	Thank you very much.
8574905	8575626	I just looked dumb.
8576647	8576987	Sorry.
8579610	8579931	I don't know.
8580932	8581252	Alright.
8582594	8585918	My final thought tonight is, it's like I'm walking on sunshine.
8586636	8587616	Loki, your final thought tonight.
8588056	8596678	My final thought is I never would have thought that Pandora would introduce me to a bunch of awesome music that I never would have heard of thanks to Pandora.
8597198	8602980	Although it also introduced me to a lot of crappy music and music that I've heard of numerous times.
8603060	8611082	But it's a little difficult to hit the thumbs up and thumbs down while driving my car.
8611562	8611922	Good point.
8612762	8612962	All right.
8612982	8615464	Well, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.
8615544	8620406	If you've enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask you guys, tell a couple people about our show.
8620607	8622227	Word of mouth is how we spread the word.
8622247	8623908	That's how we've been doing it for the past nine years.
8624229	8630172	We're not able to advertise in video game magazines or have E3 booths or have any of that.
8630192	8633194	We don't have a full-fledged team bringing news to you.
8633254	8634434	This isn't our day jobs.
8634875	8638697	We work very hard with balancing our family lives and all that stuff in this show.
8638757	8639537	And that's all we ask.
8639577	8640378	It's not a pity story.
8640678	8641058	DarkSakura.com
8660703	8663026	Even if you're like, I hate every single show on all games.
8663246	8663627	Fine.
8664087	8665148	You're a real picky bitch.
8665469	8668292	But there's got to be something in the indie universe that's for you.
8668312	8669674	So support independent podcasting.
8670054	8670835	Thank you very much, guys.
8671096	8671816	Have a wonderful week.
8671876	8673879	We will see you back here next week for episode number...
8674923	8675804	400 OMG.
8676364	8677064	Until then, good night.
8701733	8705635	or AllGames.com, but we're probably right anyway.
8706216	8707036	See you next week!
