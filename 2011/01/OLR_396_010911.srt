1
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:26,688
[SPEAKER_06]: A popular PC game prepares for release on Xbox Live, more details come out about the next Elder Scrolls game, and EA prepares to disconnect the servers for several old games.

2
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:38,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:47,805
[SPEAKER_08]: We do tape live at All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern-ish, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show wraps up.

4
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:52,608
[SPEAKER_08]: We really like Bobby because he always has us on our show and does this nice little transition and

5
00:00:52,848 --> 00:01:01,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight we were talking about light-up cereal boxes, but before we get to yummy, delicious electrical cereal, let me introduce the cast and crew here at Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:01:01,777 --> 00:01:06,281
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:07,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

8
00:01:07,342 --> 00:01:07,743
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

9
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:08,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hungry.

10
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:11,987
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you prefer, electric Trix or electric Honey Nut Cheerios?

11
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:12,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither.

12
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:13,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

13
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:14,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I hate both of them.

14
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what electric cereal would you like?

15
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:19,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosted Mini Wheats.

16
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:21,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Grape Nuts.

17
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I adore Grape Nuts, but I'd have to say my favorite cereal of all time is Frosted Mini Wheats.

18
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:30,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get to my favorite cereal in a minute.

19
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:32,299
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, we'll talk about games too.

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,042
[SPEAKER_08]: But say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

21
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:36,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

22
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:37,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, how are you, Loki?

23
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:38,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine.

24
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:41,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm finishing my last piece of Honey Barbecue Chicken.

25
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,190
[SPEAKER_08]: What was your favorite cereal growing up?

26
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Honey Barbecue Chicken Nuggets?

27
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:45,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell no.

28
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:47,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you know, it's kind of funny.

29
00:01:47,294 --> 00:01:49,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I like both extremes of cereal.

30
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:52,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, really bad for me cereal and really good for me cereal.

31
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:53,177
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird.

32
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:59,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I used to, and I still do, like Special K. Yes, the chick cereal.

33
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot about that.

34
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:09,845
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of the greatest moments of this show's history was when it came out that you enjoyed Special K. It's pretty good, actually.

35
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:10,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not bad.

36
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:13,267
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Special K, I actually...

37
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Captain Crunch

38
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:39,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

39
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:42,103
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that is always last in the package for me is Lucky Charms.

40
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:43,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate Lucky Charms.

41
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And, well, Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

42
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:48,286
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing about Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

43
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:49,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate it with milk.

44
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:50,847
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to eat it dry.

45
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:54,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just really, because all the cinnamon falls off.

46
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like cereal with milk at all.

47
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,191
[SPEAKER_08]: I eat all my cereal dry.

48
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I know that's really weird to some people.

49
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:00,172
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not weird at all.

50
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:01,312
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's how I do it.

51
00:03:01,592 --> 00:03:03,173
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what the other one is really addicting?

52
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:05,654
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?

53
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:06,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Golden Grahams.

54
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:07,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

55
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:09,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't stop eating that stuff.

56
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:14,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you can't have a video game show and talk about cereal without bringing up Nintendo cereal.

57
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:16,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Did anyone ever try that when they were younger?

58
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:16,959
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked it.

59
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:17,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was hideous.

60
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:18,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

61
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't mind it.

62
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:19,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was pretty good.

63
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like kid cereals.

64
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated marshmallows.

65
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:24,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I still hate marshmallows.

66
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:28,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo cereal was closest probably to Froot Loops because I've soon remembered it was more like fruity and sugary.

67
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would be the taste it was close to.

68
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:32,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Froot Loops weren't really big on my plate either.

69
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:33,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean they were okay.

70
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:34,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't like it.

71
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember Nintendo cereal having marshmallows.

72
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:37,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it did.

73
00:03:37,423 --> 00:03:38,486
[SPEAKER_04]: break into the shredded wheat.

74
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say my favorite breakfast cereal of all time, and this might surprise some people, is Crispix.

75
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:45,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Crispix is good.

76
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:47,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I fucking love Crispix.

77
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,681
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like half rice on one side, half corn on the other.

78
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:50,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that stuff is good.

79
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:51,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And gluten-free.

80
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:52,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what it is.

81
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:53,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing.

82
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:54,544
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my favorite cereal.

83
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:55,805
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even a sugar candy cereal.

84
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:56,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, I need to get a box of that.

85
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:57,927
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so good.

86
00:03:58,607 --> 00:03:59,468
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the texture.

87
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:02,570
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so gross, but it's the truth.

88
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:06,333
[SPEAKER_08]: I love putting Crispix and using my tongue to smash it to little bits.

89
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:08,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to do that too.

90
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:09,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody does it.

91
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,137
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just no one talks about it.

92
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:22,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I would eat one half of one side And then eat the other half It's like eating an Oreo with no cream filling It's with milk filling I remember when they first brought Crispix out I mean, that was something that came out later on in my life

93
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:27,733
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkTetsuya in our chat room.

94
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:29,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, we have to introduce the chat room.

95
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:30,113
[SPEAKER_08]: We love the chatters.

96
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:32,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

97
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:35,716
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya wants to know, are there any cereal podcasts out there?

98
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:38,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but maybe we need to start one.

99
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:41,158
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have to look for one.

100
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:41,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

101
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:43,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And many folks in our chat room agree.

102
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there's one called the Ethereal Cereal Podcast.

103
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

104
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

105
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I just found it.

106
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it really about breakfast cereal?

107
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,082
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm going to find out.

108
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:53,082
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

109
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:56,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anyhow, we will talk plenty more about breakfast cereal.

110
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:57,704
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one called Get Cereal.

111
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:58,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Food and everything.

112
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:00,605
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have to talk about our gaming weeks.

113
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,866
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to bring it back to video games.

114
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:02,966
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a new year.

115
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:03,146
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 2011.

116
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:11,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of a tiny, tiny lull in new games right now because everyone, I think, is catching up from last year's games.

117
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,091
[SPEAKER_08]: But things are going to hit the ground fast.

118
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:16,412
[SPEAKER_08]: LittleBigPlanet 2, I believe, is this week.

119
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:19,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just going to be the first in several huge, huge releases.

120
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:20,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, next week.

121
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:21,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki's correcting me.

122
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:22,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew it was January mid-somewhere.

123
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:51,752
[SPEAKER_08]: But very soon that's going to come out and that's kind of the first of several bing bing bing big stuff coming up Oh yeah, DC Universe is this week, thank you Loki So I'm going to be quitting World of Warcraft When I played the beta on PC I had a good time with it So I never did get around to playing the PS3 one and they pulled the plug on it So I'm torn, I don't know if I really want to get into DC Universe or not But anyway, I guess we can talk about that later Let's talk about what's going on right now in your gaming week Dark Sakura, start us off

124
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I hit level 63 right before the show.

125
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:18,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but this whole, like, like if you go listen to the last show on the feed right now, I'm pretty sure you were still hating on World of Warcraft and Razami for playing it.

126
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:24,738
[SPEAKER_08]: So like podcaster only people have no idea that you have now leveled to 63.

127
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:25,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Not last week.

128
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:27,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause last week was after I got back from Washington.

129
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:30,179
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the last show on the archives was.

130
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, on the archives.

131
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:31,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

132
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:31,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

133
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:32,339
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

134
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they, they changed enough in it that I was like, okay, I got it.

135
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to give it a try.

136
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know me, I'm not gonna bitch about something without having tried it myself.

137
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:44,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

138
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:46,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a good thing to do.

139
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:49,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and besides that, I just like fucking with you guys, you know?

140
00:06:49,064 --> 00:06:49,985
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I know, I know.

141
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:54,066
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like I mess with you for some of the things you like, but secretly it's alright.

142
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:58,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, for the record, I haven't touched Second Life since the last time I said I haven't touched Second Life.

143
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the record, Grape Nuts aren't so bad.

144
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:02,613
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually pretty good.

145
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:03,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Grape Nuts are great.

146
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:04,455
[SPEAKER_04]: They're great!

147
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:05,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

148
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:09,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I, on the other hand, think Grape Nuts are nasty and you really shouldn't touch Second Life ever.

149
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Some things never change on this program.

150
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:15,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, anyway.

151
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:18,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I, well, okay.

152
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:24,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I know last week live I, you know, mentioned that I had really hurt my lower back.

153
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,532
[SPEAKER_04]: It's technically my right hip.

154
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:27,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Really bad.

155
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:28,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I sprained my hip.

156
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:31,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's more funny to say I sprained my butt because really it's,

157
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:32,776
[SPEAKER_00]: You broke your butt.

158
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:37,679
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've been seeing my chiropractor.

159
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:43,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one more appointment to go to and it still hurts but it's not nearly as the debilitating pain I was in before.

160
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:50,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So all I could do is just sit here on an ice pack and play World of Warcraft because what else was there for me to do?

161
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:56,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done everything in Star Trek Online and I still love Star Trek Online so much but all I was doing was freaking playing Dabo.

162
00:07:57,632 --> 00:07:59,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's only so much gambling one can do.

163
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like this point in our chatroom here from Salacious Pop.

164
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:09,380
[SPEAKER_08]: In my opinion, this just proves that Blizzard properly redid the experience in Kata, which was the point.

165
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,182
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-60 was still from 2004 and shitty.

166
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:14,524
[SPEAKER_08]: If Jamie likes it now, then they really gave it an overhaul.

167
00:08:15,205 --> 00:08:22,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, and now Dan was like, oh, they dumbed it down for people so that people can, you know, have a more rewarding experience and blah, blah, blah.

168
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:30,065
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, you know, when I first, when I first, first started playing, this was, you know, when I got Burning Crusade, when it was new, ooh.

169
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,048
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, okay, I've done everything.

170
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going anywhere.

171
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:35,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done all this.

172
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going anywhere.

173
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:38,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking boring.

174
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:43,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Same gameplay over and over and over and over and nothing interesting.

175
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:44,876
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's a big part of the change, too.

176
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:50,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to go too far into this because, again, we have the separate Warcraft show now because we talk too much about it on this show.

177
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,464
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's important because where Warcraft goes, like it or not, it is the biggest MMO right now.

178
00:08:55,564 --> 00:08:58,086
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of the industry will follow Warcraft.

179
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:01,008
[SPEAKER_08]: with some exceptions, which we'll get into even later in the show.

180
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:09,736
[SPEAKER_08]: But my point, in old Vanilla WoW, a lot of the quests were fetch me animal pelts, kill X number of monsters.

181
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:10,797
[SPEAKER_04]: And they still have a lot of that.

182
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:18,523
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is a lot of that, but they've also mixed in a lot of more interesting technology from the newer expansions, like vehicle stuff from Rapid Lich King.

183
00:09:18,563 --> 00:09:21,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Use this item to scrape tar off this creature's ass.

184
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:22,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, things like that.

185
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:23,948
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm talking about too, don't you?

186
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:25,650
[SPEAKER_08]: No one, because I haven't done that quest.

187
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,391
[SPEAKER_08]: But did you get to dig through the poop for the key?

188
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:28,052
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

189
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:28,712
[SPEAKER_08]: That quest I did.

190
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:30,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I did see the one.

191
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:31,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now Tiara showed me this one.

192
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:38,781
[SPEAKER_04]: It was where you go to, oh crap, what's the, not the Outlands, but the place where everything's red?

193
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:40,703
[SPEAKER_04]: That has the big scar?

194
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:42,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Baron's?

195
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:43,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Badlands.

196
00:09:44,253 --> 00:09:44,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

197
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:47,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Because keep in mind, I'm still learning what everything's called.

198
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:56,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And you run into a gnome, a dwarf, and something else.

199
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,820
[SPEAKER_05]: A pizza place?

200
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:58,341
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

201
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:00,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what you did there.

202
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:03,243
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a setup for a bad joke.

203
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:07,385
[SPEAKER_04]: The dwarf is like, I went up to Deathwing and I punched him in the face!

204
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I got on my motorcycle and picked up some hot babes, and we had a tender moment.

205
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:33,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's the one where one of the hot babes is a blood elf male.

206
00:10:33,862 --> 00:10:34,543
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that.

207
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:35,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I've seen that.

208
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:36,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

209
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:42,530
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically they were all telling tall tales and it was really funny.

210
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,090
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cute.

211
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:46,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I like is that there's a lot more comedy thrown in there.

212
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:51,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the quests have names that make me laugh my ass off.

213
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:56,983
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm still pissed off at that stupid dragon for setting the world on fire and not setting me on fire.

214
00:10:57,743 --> 00:10:58,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid fucking dragon.

215
00:10:59,865 --> 00:11:00,986
[SPEAKER_04]: You were online with me for this.

216
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:01,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I was.

217
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:04,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're like, I'm standing in the fire and not dying.

218
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:04,928
[SPEAKER_08]: What is wrong?

219
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:07,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a screen capture of me in the fire not dying.

220
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:11,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted the damn achievement.

221
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:13,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I got achievements that you don't have.

222
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:15,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

223
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:15,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to X-Link.

224
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:16,597
[SPEAKER_08]: No one, Kerr.

225
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:17,197
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

226
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:19,639
[SPEAKER_08]: What else besides WoW have you been playing?

227
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:22,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, also, thank you for the thing that you sort of were in on.

228
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:23,602
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

229
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:25,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I got 800 gold.

230
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna go buy me a bird.

231
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:30,854
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was playing other stuff, though it was really solitaire.

232
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:33,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mushihime-sama!

233
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:35,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that game is crack.

234
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you, cave fans, if you want a little fun, it's still bullet hell.

235
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:41,882
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just bullet hell with running.

236
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:47,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, you target stuff, and then you let your things fall, but you still have to avoid the bullet.

237
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,267
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bullet hell.

238
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,468
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bullet hell on feet.

239
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hell.

240
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:52,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

241
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

242
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:56,191
[SPEAKER_05]: It was okay.

243
00:11:56,852 --> 00:11:58,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a few different things this week.

244
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:03,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I played The Flying Hamster, which is pretty awesome.

245
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:21,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a game that was a PSP Mini at one point, and they just brought it over to the iOS platform, and it's kind of a shooter game where you play a chibi flying hamster who has to save his hamster girlfriend or something like that, and it's a shooter, and it's really hard, actually, but it's all chibi, and it's kind of cool.

246
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:23,203
[SPEAKER_05]: So I played that.

247
00:12:23,884 --> 00:12:26,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, uh, more Sword and Poker 2.

248
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually almost done with that game.

249
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:35,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in the last dungeon, and I'm maybe six floors in, so that's pretty cool.

250
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, what else did I play?

251
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:42,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I played a little bit more, uh, Cannonbolt, which is fun.

252
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:43,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

253
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:46,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.

254
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, more Grand Theft Auto.

255
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:55,374
[SPEAKER_05]: But finally, after working on it for six months, we got our new modded games running again.

256
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:57,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tell you, that first game...

257
00:12:58,769 --> 00:12:59,490
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

258
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:24,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't having as much fun as they could be having because I usually am kicking the crap out of them.

259
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:29,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the mod games, everybody has fun and it's just so over the top.

260
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:35,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hysterically laughing throughout the whole game because all this crazy shit was happening.

261
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,924
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.

262
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to playing more of that.

263
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:46,269
[SPEAKER_05]: This time though, we hot swapped all of our drives so we don't get banned.

264
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,571
[SPEAKER_05]: So our consoles don't get banned this time.

265
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:52,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty fast at it now.

266
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:55,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hot swap a console in about 15 minutes.

267
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:57,174
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like field stripping a gun or something.

268
00:13:57,194 --> 00:13:58,534
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty quick.

269
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:01,835
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I played that.

270
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:05,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually looking forward to playing some new games soon.

271
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:07,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pick up LittleBigPlanet.

272
00:14:08,218 --> 00:14:16,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the collector's edition on order because I want those bookends and the little stuffed plush sack boy for my desk.

273
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:16,821
[SPEAKER_05]: And then...

274
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that's probably going to be the newest thing I'm going to play for a while.

275
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:29,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to actually finally update my console now that certain hacks have come out that allow custom firmwares and whatnot.

276
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,615
[SPEAKER_05]: On any firmware console.

277
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,472
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to get Linux on your good old PS3 again, huh?

278
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:41,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really want even Linux.

279
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:47,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the thing is I had the opportunity to actually mod my console to where I could pirate games on it.

280
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:51,904
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just didn't want to pirate games on the PS3.

281
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:54,687
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's saying something.

282
00:14:56,468 --> 00:15:22,260
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's not a good something alright let's see moving on to my gaming week sadly I don't have a lot of new new stuff to report I haven't had a lot of money to buy a lot of extra games lately so it's mostly the same stuff I was talking about last week with Fallout 3 and continuing on White Knight Chronicles a little more although I have to admit the online stuff still doesn't make sense to me but whatever at least my internet is somewhat cooperating so I can keep a connection to PlayStation Network now

283
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:48,563
[SPEAKER_08]: so that's nice so I guess I'll dip in a little bit and talk about some iPhone games that I've checked out recently one of them that I think you guys would like and this was something that was somebody had shouted out to me on Twitter and I so apologize because I forgot who sent this to me on Twitter but it's a game called VGMC or Video Game Music Challenge and it's free on the App Store and all it is is it plays like theme songs from old school video games and you're given like

284
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:50,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try Paperboy.

285
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:50,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct!

286
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:50,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's another one.

287
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario 3, right?

288
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:24,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

289
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:26,933
[SPEAKER_08]: So that probably doesn't pick up on the speed review, so I apologize.

290
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all kind of mid-ied.

291
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:30,014
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit, yeah.

292
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:31,975
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like the original, original stuff, but it's all mid-ied.

293
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,876
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, it was free, so I think that's kind of cool.

294
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:35,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play that too, I forgot.

295
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:35,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you?

296
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:36,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

297
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:36,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's cute.

298
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:37,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

299
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:38,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a fun one.

300
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:44,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a little bit of Cut the Rope, the holiday edition, which is this really popular iPhone game, is Cut the Rope.

301
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:50,504
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm cheap, and I like to have a lot of the free demos before I buy games, and so they have this holiday edition that's free.

302
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:52,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's basically a puzzle game.

303
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:53,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

304
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:20,236
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

305
00:17:39,565 --> 00:18:07,638
[SPEAKER_08]: for money and it's like it's too hard to just get in there and like play a game the interface is shit I'm sorry I don't have a nice way of saying it like they have just destroyed the game because they're trying too hard to build this music store around it and I don't need all this I don't really like all this other bullshit like OpenFaint and I don't even like Game Center and some of this other stuff like I really wish there was just one for all of it and to be honest I honestly

306
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:15,001
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as I like OpenFaint and what it's trying to do, we need one standard across all the iPhone games.

307
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:20,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Apple ought to just step in and say, it's Game Center and get the fuck out.

308
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:23,284
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to stop approving your apps if it has any other shit in it.

309
00:18:23,384 --> 00:18:30,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's a terrible thing to say because Game Center is the worst of all of them, but maybe they can work with the OpenFaint people.

310
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:31,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

311
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:35,490
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's ridiculous that you have all these different games and they have all these different add-ons.

312
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,610
[SPEAKER_04]: They should just buy and absorb OpenFaint.

313
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,331
[SPEAKER_08]: or something.

314
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:37,891
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

315
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:42,116
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of people that are going to really hate that I said that but it's just annoying.

316
00:18:42,276 --> 00:18:43,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of don't like either of them though.

317
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:46,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate all these freaking pop-ups when I start games.

318
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:48,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Sign up for OpenFaint.

319
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:49,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Sign up for this network.

320
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:50,345
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

321
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an iPhone so I don't have to play with other people.

322
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:54,389
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?

323
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:55,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

324
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:56,111
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

325
00:18:56,724 --> 00:19:00,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, let your friends on Twitter and Facebook know that you're playing another fake game.

326
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:04,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I will post on Facebook if I want them to know I'm playing this game.

327
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:05,928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting to be too much.

328
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:08,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a Facebook update every time I score a point.

329
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,675
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no.

330
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:15,739
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, believe it or not, I downloaded Smurf Village on the iPhone.

331
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,601
[SPEAKER_08]: It's stupid.

332
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:18,562
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Facebook game.

333
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:21,285
[SPEAKER_08]: If you like those Facebook grindy games, then have fun.

334
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:27,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I prefer Knights of the Clicky on Facebook, which, by the way, I got Extover to play, or he played it.

335
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:31,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, because he heard one of us talking about it, and he said it was the worst thing he'd ever played in his life.

336
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:33,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Night of the Crystal

337
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:52,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you kind of echo a lot of people that are kind of done with Knights of the Clicky.

338
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, once you beat that final boss, you can kind of grind old quests and stuff, but there's not a lot else to do.

339
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:01,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, they did just recently release... I can't believe I'm talking about a Facebook game.

340
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,362
[SPEAKER_08]: We really do need... They released some new levels.

341
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: We really do need an official Knights of the Clicky starring Clicky the Pen.

342
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:08,768
Yeah.

343
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,314
[SPEAKER_08]: A different show on the network owns the rights to that character.

344
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:16,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll have to get agreements and contracts.

345
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,265
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I haven't gotten to the last boss because I actually have been going through for gold mastery on other levels.

346
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:21,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

347
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:23,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm like, this is boring.

348
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,449
[SPEAKER_04]: What the crap am I doing?

349
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:25,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

350
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Some comments in our chat room.

351
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:29,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Some talk about Steam and Apple.

352
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:33,139
[SPEAKER_08]: William Murderface says Apple needs to get in bed with Steam already.

353
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:33,759
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

354
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft says Apple kind of already did that.

355
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:37,163
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when Portal came out for free.

356
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:38,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's true.

357
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Steam is on the Apple system now.

358
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:43,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's good for them, but I mean, no.

359
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Apple doesn't need to buy Steam.

360
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:46,692
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some other big news in the

361
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:14,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's move on into some housekeeping tonight.

362
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:25,797
[SPEAKER_08]: No show stuff as far as I know, although I will say it looks like we can kind of project now when episode number 400 will be, although we have yet to plan anything special for it.

363
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:38,344
[SPEAKER_08]: But if tonight is episode 396, then 397, 398, 399, episode number 400 of Orange Launch Radio will be February 6th of this year, assuming we do not miss any shows between now and then.

364
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do not have a show at 3.99 and a half

365
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:05,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure some daily ones have, but I don't know about any other weekly shows.

366
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:13,029
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there are, I don't know of them, which would be a surprise at this point because that means you have to be doing a show for at least eight, nine years like we have.

367
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:17,171
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we'll be kind of doing something a little special for episode 400.

368
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,352
[SPEAKER_08]: We just don't know what yet.

369
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,133
[SPEAKER_08]: In good OLR fashion, we're procrastinating.

370
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:24,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, you can join us on Facebook.

371
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:27,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

372
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:28,999
[SPEAKER_08]: How about another marathon episode?

373
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:29,799
[SPEAKER_08]: You like those, right?

374
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,220
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not working.

375
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.

376
00:22:35,603 --> 00:22:37,545
[SPEAKER_08]: How about we get into some gaming news?

377
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:40,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, start us off tonight with some gaming news.

378
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:55,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so of course there's some information, I mean, slightly before when the US announcement and stuff comes out on the 19th, but some stuff about the 3DS launch in Japan.

379
00:22:56,032 --> 00:23:01,754
[SPEAKER_05]: They've announced 10 titles that are going to be expected for launch.

380
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:04,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the Japanese launch date will be February 26th.

381
00:23:05,455 --> 00:23:06,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And the titles you can expect...

382
00:23:07,616 --> 00:23:26,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Winnie11 3DS, Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition, Samurai Warriors Chronicle, Tobidasu Puzzle Bobble 3D, Nintendogs Plus Cats,

383
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:51,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, they're going to do three versions of that too Toy Poodle and New Friends French Bulldog and New Friends and Sheba and New Friends Yes, I will not be stupid this time and buy all three versions Actually, I'll be smart this time and not buy any version Ridge Racer 3 I don't know, I kind of want the kitties I want the kitties too

384
00:23:53,291 --> 00:24:01,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Ridge Racer 3D, Combat of Giants, Dinosaur 3D, and Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle.

385
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:04,700
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are expected out.

386
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:12,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Also it says there's supposed to be some new titles announced as well, including BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2.

387
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:23,393
[SPEAKER_05]: and ports of Tales of the Abyss and Raving Rabbids Travel in Time, as well as the third game in the Tank Beat series.

388
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:27,476
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are going to be some launch titles.

389
00:24:28,357 --> 00:24:36,002
[SPEAKER_05]: No real word on what the pricing is going to be over here yet, but in Japan it looks like they're kind of ranging around, looks like 4,980 yen to say about...

390
00:24:41,886 --> 00:24:42,246
[SPEAKER_05]: 6,090 yen.

391
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:43,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So between, say, $60 and $73.

392
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:47,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, it's a lot more expensive over there.

393
00:24:54,938 --> 00:24:57,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, there's got to be... They're not going to be $70 games.

394
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,560
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to be $70 games here.

395
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,201
[SPEAKER_08]: But they'll be more expensive than DS games, won't they?

396
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:05,463
[SPEAKER_08]: They will be more... They'll use the 3D thing as an excuse to charge a $10 premium.

397
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:06,664
[SPEAKER_05]: They will.

398
00:25:06,804 --> 00:25:14,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already said before that one of the launch titles I've seen actually have an actual price to it is $40 retail.

399
00:25:14,828 --> 00:25:14,928
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

400
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:17,069
[SPEAKER_05]: D.S.

401
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:17,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Games

402
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:41,568
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been one or two $40 retail games, but I'm expecting probably a $10 increase.

403
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:46,471
[SPEAKER_05]: You're probably going to see everything from $40 to a $50 as a high-end game, would be my guess.

404
00:25:51,735 --> 00:26:17,555
[SPEAKER_05]: and then of course there's some more information regarding the battery life for the 3DS they're saying that the 3DS has a 3-5 hour battery life for playing 3DS games of course it's going to be a little bit longer if you're playing regular DS games which is going to be 5-8 hours and they're saying that's probably because it doesn't have to run the third display since the two displays are interlaced on the top screen um

405
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,317
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

406
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:43,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Samurai Warriors Chronicles Dead or Alive Super Monkey Ball

407
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:08,276
[SPEAKER_08]: So where's the hype at right now?

408
00:27:08,296 --> 00:27:17,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Because let me go to a comment in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Defective Candy in our chatroom says, I love Nintendo, but I'm just not going to invest in a 3DS when it comes out.

409
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:21,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to wait until they release a second version just to make sure all the bugs are worked out.

410
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:23,666
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's a good question to ask.

411
00:27:23,846 --> 00:27:25,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the hype meter now for the 3DS?

412
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:28,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Because are you guys interested in buying one now?

413
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:30,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are you kind of where Defective Candy's at?

414
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:31,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Where you're like, you know what?

415
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:39,872
[SPEAKER_08]: There is always inevitably the GBA with the backlight, the DS Lite, the second iteration of the handheld that comes out later.

416
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but here's the thing with me and the DS Lite and all that stuff.

417
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:45,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really care about the DS Lite.

418
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:56,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the only iteration would be the DSi that was slightly different where they actually had SD storage and the cameras on it and stuff like that.

419
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,320
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little different.

420
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:04,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you'd even consider that a different system almost, but it pretty much was.

421
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:20,364
[SPEAKER_05]: um sadly it won't ever be utilized and remember they're going to be having dsi only games and there was a handful of those but they're kind of crap a lot of them were crap it was just unlock extra stuff that there's really no reason we shut out of the regular ds version exactly um so

422
00:28:21,485 --> 00:28:22,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

423
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:27,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually planning on getting one at launch.

424
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:37,415
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't announced any launch titles yet, but I know one of the titles that they were working on that was supposed to be for the 3DS was the new Excite Truck game.

425
00:28:38,796 --> 00:28:43,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, if they have a new Excite Truck game at launch, I will not be able to resist.

426
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:46,480
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I am planning on getting one at launch.

427
00:28:46,700 --> 00:29:04,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And just because I don't really care about the reiterations that come out later on, unless they add major features to them, it doesn't really matter to me that they shrink down the size of the system, or they make the system bigger, or they have a different color.

428
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

429
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,601
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

430
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:38,001
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's and I'm really gonna make myself sound like an a-hole by saying this but here's where I'm coming from that a lot of you aren't coming from.

431
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:54,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen the 3DS and I've played the 3DS and like I swear I'm not saying that to be a jerk but I'm telling you I'm saying that because when you see this technology for the first time and you're like I'm looking at 3D with no glasses and

432
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:55,667
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com

433
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta say, I really want one.

434
00:30:40,976 --> 00:30:41,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

435
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:02,629
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

436
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:22,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, touchpad.

437
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:25,495
[SPEAKER_05]: You're really catching up with everybody.

438
00:31:26,396 --> 00:31:35,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't want to sound like a broken record on this show, but I always think the PSP's strength was not just as a gaming system, but as a comprehensive multimedia device.

439
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:36,839
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're really kind of expensive.

440
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:38,299
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what the 3DS doesn't have.

441
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't look at the 3DS going, I'm going to be able to browse the web in 3D.

442
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:42,641
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not.

443
00:31:42,941 --> 00:32:10,915
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're saying though that for example they were talking at CES during their keynote that they're having Sony tablets they didn't really come out and say the PSP phone but they're going to have the PSP phone they're going to have the PSP 2 probably at some point soon so I don't think they really care too much the fact that they can do all this stuff because pretty much everything now is doing all that stuff you can browse the web with any device almost

444
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:12,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Except the DS.

445
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:14,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess you can.

446
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Just not well.

447
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:16,315
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

448
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:20,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go to the chat room at chat.orangelearn.com because there's some interesting discussion going on here that I want to bring up.

449
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:23,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Gamer Girl kind of started the thing off by saying, I hate 3D.

450
00:32:23,921 --> 00:32:25,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't watch that shit.

451
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:27,544
[SPEAKER_08]: And Solar Flare says, 3D is a fad.

452
00:32:28,745 --> 00:32:35,331
[SPEAKER_08]: And CSCRSMAT454, sorry, I don't know what the preferred name is there, wait for a price drop.

453
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:36,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

454
00:32:37,401 --> 00:32:38,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the thing.

455
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:39,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I say this real quick, though?

456
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:47,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I also think I'm getting a little sick of the whole 3Ds in the movie thing because I think most movies don't benefit from it.

457
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:48,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Tron sure did.

458
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:51,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but then I'm like, but Tron was actually really awesome in 3D.

459
00:32:51,107 --> 00:32:52,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought Avatar was great in 3D.

460
00:32:53,648 --> 00:32:55,769
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and it's so difficult.

461
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,750
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think there's too much.

462
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Gulliver's Travels 3D, no thanks.

463
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Not gonna bother.

464
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:01,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not want.

465
00:33:02,452 --> 00:33:04,074
[SPEAKER_08]: But even something like Tangled was really cute.

466
00:33:04,094 --> 00:33:08,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing though, Gulliver's Travel is not a movie targeted at you, Rob.

467
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:10,579
[SPEAKER_05]: It's targeted at little kids that like Jack Black.

468
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:14,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it missed its target because it didn't do very well at the box office.

469
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:15,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the thing.

470
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:16,544
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a gamble.

471
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:22,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's something... Jack Black does not put people in the seats anymore.

472
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but it's...

473
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:30,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of which, I am going to sneak out to the theaters to see Tron one last time.

474
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:31,884
[SPEAKER_05]: In D-Box.

475
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:32,825
[SPEAKER_05]: In D-Box.

476
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:33,485
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to go.

477
00:33:33,505 --> 00:33:42,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Friday, the 14th, is the last day that they will have... Actually, no, that will be the cutoff because they're going to be getting the new D-Box movie, which is...

478
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:46,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

479
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:10,372
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was very skeptical going into the 3DS, but seeing that technology for the first time without the glasses was pretty amazing.

480
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:19,274
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to admit, my favorite part, and this is something the movies don't give you, my favorite part was that there's a little slider where you can adjust the intensity of the 3D.

481
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:23,996
[SPEAKER_08]: So it can be like, you know, kind of pulling on the eyes to, forget it, 2D.

482
00:34:24,756 --> 00:34:26,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Just throw the 3D out and have 2D.

483
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:31,538
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's interesting to me that developers are going to have to consider that, that some people are going to want to play 3D, some want to play 2D.

484
00:34:32,678 --> 00:34:57,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I the reason why I'm excited about the 3D I want to see where it's going to take games because you know things like Doom, Quake, even things like Zelda when they first came out they were called 3D games this whole virtual reality and I think now that we have real 3D technology I'm really curious to see where that's going to take the gaming and interaction technology that's where I'm at

485
00:34:57,392 --> 00:34:58,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Loki, I cut you off like five minutes.

486
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:04,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and then on the other thing is they don't have to necessarily use the 3DS top screen as a 3D screen.

487
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:10,057
[SPEAKER_05]: They can use it as an HD 2D screen because you have twice the resolution now to play around with.

488
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:13,039
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have to actually interlace it to do 3D.

489
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:17,701
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's a lot of potential to do some really good looking games.

490
00:35:17,861 --> 00:35:19,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And the games on it look really good.

491
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:20,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like the...

492
00:35:46,564 --> 00:35:47,345
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

493
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious to know more details about what the US is getting.

494
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:55,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I was very surprised to hear that there is no pack-in at all.

495
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And we haven't heard what the new Mario game is going to be.

496
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine a new Mario game on this?

497
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:01,754
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be sexy.

498
00:36:02,155 --> 00:36:10,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I also do have to mention that for the people in the chat room who are pissing about 3D, if you don't like it, don't see it.

499
00:36:11,823 --> 00:36:12,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, true.

500
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:15,466
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I did ask the question, who's going to buy this and who's not?

501
00:36:15,646 --> 00:36:16,947
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, if they're not, that's fine.

502
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:21,910
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm saying, you know, for the people who are just saying 3D is overdone, 3D is overdone, if you don't like it, fine.

503
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ruin it for the people that like it.

504
00:36:24,072 --> 00:36:26,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, you know, that's this thing.

505
00:36:27,174 --> 00:36:30,316
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't want your games in 3D, don't buy a 3DS.

506
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:34,559
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't want your movies in 3D, don't go see them in 3D.

507
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:38,221
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't want to watch TV in 3D, don't get a 3D TV.

508
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:39,482
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that easy.

509
00:36:39,642 --> 00:36:40,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop bitching.

510
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,955
[SPEAKER_08]: 3D is slowly becoming the norm

511
00:37:01,494 --> 00:37:07,804
[SPEAKER_08]: But otherwise, everybody's talking about 3D, 3D, 3D TVs, 3D TVs without glasses, 3D... 3D's not going anywhere.

512
00:37:07,944 --> 00:37:12,350
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be around for a while, and it will become the norm, and people will just stop bitching about it.

513
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a fad, but yes, just like... So I can see where people are concerned about that.

514
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:30,699
[SPEAKER_05]: But just like any emerging technology, just like with, you know, the Wii and stuff like that, the first, you know, the first games you have on the Wii or whatever are gonna be really cheesy and they're gonna be just some cheap ideas to utilize the technology.

515
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:39,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like the first 3D movies, you know, there's a couple good ones and a lot of them were just tacked on 3D to get people in the seats because it's a 3D movie.

516
00:37:39,963 --> 00:37:43,485
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of stuff now, a lot of movies are being filmed in 3D.

517
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:45,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, you're not gonna see, you know,

518
00:37:46,835 --> 00:38:03,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, Sister of the Traveling Pants 3 in 3D God, let's hope not But I think eventually everything will be in 3D And that's just going to be the way it is And then when you're talking to your kids about how you used to see the 2D movies They're like, 2D?

519
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:05,902
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about?

520
00:38:05,942 --> 00:38:06,842
[SPEAKER_05]: What is 2D?

521
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:11,384
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the time when the 4D dimension will be coming out And you can watch movies in an alternate time

522
00:38:12,385 --> 00:38:17,126
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my issue is that people bitched about TV when it was new.

523
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:20,707
[SPEAKER_04]: People bitched about HDTV.

524
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:24,308
[SPEAKER_04]: People bitched when it was time to go from 8-track to cassette.

525
00:38:24,988 --> 00:38:26,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Or VHS to DVD.

526
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:27,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

527
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:30,049
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing over and over.

528
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just sort of like a big inevitability.

529
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Technology is going to progress.

530
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:38,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta play devil's advocate.

531
00:38:39,271 --> 00:38:41,532
[SPEAKER_08]: None of those technologies hurt my eyes.

532
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,233
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one downside I can see to this 3D.

533
00:38:46,453 --> 00:38:46,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

534
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:51,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, even when I go to do the 3D movies and so forth, like, I can't wear the glasses for the whole two hours consecutively.

535
00:38:51,676 --> 00:38:52,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you know why, though?

536
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:57,280
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because the technology that they have right now, there's a lot of flicker and just... But they're gonna catch up.

537
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:01,143
[SPEAKER_05]: It's... The technology will get better and it'll be less harsh on your eyes.

538
00:39:01,183 --> 00:39:01,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's fair.

539
00:39:01,603 --> 00:39:02,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, think about this.

540
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:05,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, look at televisions in the 80s.

541
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:05,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

542
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:12,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember those big, you know, cabinet televisions that would have that, you know, look like, oh, they're supposed to be nice furniture and shit.

543
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,730
[SPEAKER_04]: A really blurry screen quality.

544
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:21,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've got TVs that are three times those size in perfect crystal clear HD quality.

545
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:23,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're talking about a span of 25 years.

546
00:39:25,135 --> 00:39:29,216
[SPEAKER_08]: So... So by the time I'm 50, the holodeck should be out, right?

547
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:30,697
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not saying that.

548
00:39:30,857 --> 00:39:32,297
[SPEAKER_04]: But now also...

549
00:39:34,398 --> 00:39:38,283
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you think about it too, the growth of technology is also exponential.

550
00:39:41,366 --> 00:39:48,595
[SPEAKER_04]: The more technological advancement you get in the different fields, they're going to speed up the new rate of research.

551
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:50,657
[SPEAKER_04]: The more you learn, the more you're going to learn.

552
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:51,839
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I see it.

553
00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:54,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Two very interesting comments in chat.

554
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:54,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta bring up.

555
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Bochikawa in our chatroom says, Besides, we're still playing games on the NES.

556
00:39:59,672 --> 00:40:01,032
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want new, then get new.

557
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:02,613
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want old, play old.

558
00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:03,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

559
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:04,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

560
00:40:04,753 --> 00:40:05,994
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we do.

561
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:07,614
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a whole room full of old.

562
00:40:07,914 --> 00:40:10,996
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not to say that all technologies end up taking off.

563
00:40:11,156 --> 00:40:11,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Old is new.

564
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at how much retro crap gets repackaged and comes out.

565
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:15,897
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

566
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,618
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because all the kids have grown up and are making the games.

567
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:19,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Fascinating.

568
00:40:19,438 --> 00:40:20,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you believe...

569
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:34,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if this is on our show or not, but can you believe that copies of Super Mario All-Stars, the reprint that was on the Wii, are selling for $75 and $80 on eBay?

570
00:40:35,288 --> 00:40:35,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

571
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:37,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you people fucking nuts?

572
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me bring this up in chat as well because this is another good comment.

573
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:42,912
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I promise we can change the topic.

574
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:47,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor in our chatroom says, why now versus the last 3D?

575
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:50,134
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's a very legitimate question.

576
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:53,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm guessing a lot of it has to do with the technology.

577
00:40:54,015 --> 00:41:00,757
[SPEAKER_08]: The last time 3D was big was the mid-early 80s when JAWS 3D was out and that stuff.

578
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:02,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm thinking...

579
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,040
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two reasons for it.

580
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:09,243
[SPEAKER_08]: A, that technology wasn't as good, period.

581
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:21,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, when you're talking to 3DS, again, I'm telling you guys, the first time you see it without glasses, you do have that moment of, whoa, everybody's going to have that moment of, whoa, I'm playing this and I'm not wearing glasses and I'm seeing the 3D.

582
00:41:22,373 --> 00:41:25,915
[SPEAKER_08]: And then B, Jaws 3D was not Avatar.

583
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:31,499
[SPEAKER_08]: And love Avatar or hate it, the fact is it's the highest grossing movie ever.

584
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,361
[SPEAKER_08]: And now everybody wants to be it.

585
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:37,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the two big differences to me.

586
00:41:37,984 --> 00:41:44,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Technology has come a long way and a movie got to be extremely successful with the technology.

587
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:48,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you that Avatar didn't make its money because people liked the plot.

588
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:49,977
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted to see the pretty 3D.

589
00:41:51,201 --> 00:42:06,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but if you also look into the actual technology that went into it, it's basically, and I think they applied some of it to a lesser extent in Tron, remember, with having the 3D modeled younger face, even though he looked like plastic.

590
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:08,978
[SPEAKER_08]: That technology still needs some work.

591
00:42:09,939 --> 00:42:14,403
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think what they needed was better animation.

592
00:42:15,044 --> 00:42:16,105
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think that that needed.

593
00:42:16,445 --> 00:42:18,446
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

594
00:42:33,915 --> 00:42:35,897
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, I'll use Tron since I was already on it.

595
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:42,042
[SPEAKER_04]: In the first Tron movie, when he walks into the cubicle area and there's cubicles going on for miles, that was on matte painting.

596
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:54,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Or remember V when they walked into the ship and it's the whole lines of the storage pods going on in the back in the old one.

597
00:42:54,813 --> 00:42:55,774
[SPEAKER_04]: That was on matte painting.

598
00:42:56,154 --> 00:42:58,897
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite was always rear projection for driving scenes.

599
00:42:59,077 --> 00:42:59,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

600
00:42:59,591 --> 00:43:27,614
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah but now if you look at that you're gonna I don't think that the craftsmanship is going anywhere it's just moving to a different medium you're still gonna have to have animators you're still gonna have to have artists that are gonna be able to make all of this and yeah maybe you're saving in resources and paint and that type of thing and keep in mind I still think nothing will replace painting nothing will replace physical art you know what I mean

601
00:43:28,474 --> 00:43:46,819
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I think that if you're looking in terms of pushing the envelope as far as the experience that you can deliver in technology, in a cinematic experience, or in games or movies, anything like that, that you're going to have to start making situations where it's cheaper to produce.

602
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:53,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's going to be the advantage of going with the same type of innovations that they made with Avatar.

603
00:43:53,181 --> 00:43:56,022
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what my point was, is the fact that you could have...

604
00:43:57,422 --> 00:44:09,606
[SPEAKER_04]: and then send it off to a team of animators and have this high quality product produced with some time and effort but you're not paying for a set.

605
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,547
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not paying for makeup.

606
00:44:11,927 --> 00:44:12,848
[SPEAKER_04]: None of that.

607
00:44:14,428 --> 00:44:15,108
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my point.

608
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:19,609
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I see everything going with the technology developed with that.

609
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:21,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, cool movie.

610
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:25,531
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that they need to take the same things.

611
00:44:25,691 --> 00:44:28,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, they could even do the same thing with video games.

612
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:30,132
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had motion capture in video games before.

613
00:44:31,192 --> 00:44:33,813
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep in mind taking that same sort of...

614
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:49,274
[SPEAKER_04]: you know the blank set you can actually do all of your cinematic cutscenes with like actual actors and record them real time have them you know the layers and everything put over it for a game and boom there you go

615
00:44:50,765 --> 00:44:53,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me try to wrap up this topic by going back to one other thought.

616
00:45:19,331 --> 00:45:20,672
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

617
00:45:49,627 --> 00:45:56,091
[SPEAKER_08]: All these launch games are kind of like that obvious thing to do the technology.

618
00:45:56,471 --> 00:46:00,694
[SPEAKER_08]: All the Kinect launch games were essentially Wii knockoffs and Dance Central.

619
00:46:01,975 --> 00:46:09,019
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, all the 3DS things are these, you know, Nintendo upgrades and sort of like, you know, finally Kid Icarus coming back and so forth.

620
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:36,438
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really curious now what is going to be next now that these technologies are established how are you going to take it to the next level what is that must have game going to have in it that implements that technology that just blows us away so I'm really interested in what's going to be brought to the table this year at E3 and it's either going to be great or it's going to show that you know what we should have never left where we were last year

621
00:46:38,103 --> 00:46:38,464
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

622
00:46:50,422 --> 00:46:52,123
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

623
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:20,199
[SPEAKER_04]: They are now doing the whole, I hate the word term, microtransaction, because a transaction is a transaction.

624
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck putting a size on it.

625
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:28,644
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're using this little, you know, and I can see doing it.

626
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:31,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing some of them in Star Trek Online when I was playing.

627
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:36,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought outfits and shit packs and stuff, even with my subscription fee.

628
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:48,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can see that if someone wants to, you know, make, you know, a character look a certain way, they're going to spend all the little bits and pieces and not even see that they're nickel-diming their money right into their pocket.

629
00:47:49,986 --> 00:47:55,348
[SPEAKER_08]: and I've always said the minute this technology comes out for World of Warcraft, Horde House is over, I'm quitting WoW.

630
00:47:55,988 --> 00:48:02,510
[SPEAKER_08]: The minute this type of stuff, and you might already say, oh Rob, you can already do it, the mounts, that's all superficial crap.

631
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,411
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, it does not affect the base game.

632
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:05,691
[SPEAKER_04]: When this becomes their model.

633
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:06,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

634
00:48:06,932 --> 00:48:16,775
[SPEAKER_08]: If Warcraft ever implements this stuff where the stats change or you're getting things that otherwise you'd grind dungeons for or whatever, Horde House is cancelled and WoW is done.

635
00:48:17,915 --> 00:48:25,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I like playing a game where everybody's on an equal playing field.

636
00:48:25,818 --> 00:48:27,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's paying $15 a month.

637
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:36,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody is on that same playing field when it comes to the quests that you're grinding and so forth, and those that get the super awesome items really worked for it.

638
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:48,206
[SPEAKER_08]: However, that's not to slam this other idea because, you know, not everything can be wow and not everything can kind of command the $15 up front.

639
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:53,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we've seen a lot of the same model, oddly enough, in Facebook games and it's worked really well.

640
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:56,720
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

641
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:02,921
[SPEAKER_08]: These games, I'm okay with the way they do it because it's sort of like, well, you know nothing in this world is really free.

642
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:06,802
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's how they choose to nickel and dime you instead of the cost of the game.

643
00:49:07,222 --> 00:49:10,463
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, I don't know, for some reason, I'm okay with it.

644
00:49:10,503 --> 00:49:18,644
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, I can't think of any free-to-play games that I really play with any regularity except one or two Facebook games.

645
00:49:19,264 --> 00:49:23,865
[SPEAKER_08]: That even then, if they were to disappear and delete tomorrow, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

646
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:48,065
[SPEAKER_04]: well you keep in mind too that a lot of like remember when I was playing Ragnarok online a lot of the free servers that I would play on they would actually make the money to run the servers by offering special items for people who donated and you know that's been going on for years Second Life that's how they run you know you pay real money for stuff that people have made and

647
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:50,945
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you do your thing there.

648
00:49:51,505 --> 00:50:00,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's just now they're saying that when you don't notice how much you're spending, that it's easier to spend a lot more.

649
00:50:01,948 --> 00:50:02,648
[SPEAKER_04]: If that makes sense.

650
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:04,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

651
00:50:04,509 --> 00:50:05,969
[SPEAKER_08]: That's gambling.

652
00:50:06,189 --> 00:50:06,929
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of that.

653
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:10,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, you're not dealing with actual physical money.

654
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,611
[SPEAKER_04]: You're dealing with a click yes.

655
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:16,232
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no money leaving your hand, but it's relieving your bank account.

656
00:50:16,252 --> 00:50:17,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

657
00:50:18,396 --> 00:50:19,117
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be dangerous.

658
00:50:19,237 --> 00:50:21,959
[SPEAKER_08]: When Xbox Live first came out, I bought every single arcade game that came out.

659
00:50:21,979 --> 00:50:22,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Freaking iTunes.

660
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, iTunes is easy to fall into that too.

661
00:50:25,882 --> 00:50:26,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.

662
00:50:26,442 --> 00:50:26,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.

663
00:50:27,603 --> 00:50:28,284
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway.

664
00:50:30,202 --> 00:50:31,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Good talks tonight.

665
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Xbox Live... Keep a ledger by your desk when you play.

666
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:35,986
[SPEAKER_08]: For real.

667
00:50:36,486 --> 00:50:38,387
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki, what's up next in the news for us?

668
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:39,207
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

669
00:50:39,908 --> 00:50:41,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

670
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:44,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, this is kind of cool.

671
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:46,572
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing a new promotion.

672
00:50:46,612 --> 00:50:51,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's kind of something that they've been doing each year for Xbox Live Arcade, the house party.

673
00:50:52,936 --> 00:50:55,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this time they've got a lineup of games coming up.

674
00:50:55,197 --> 00:50:55,998
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually pretty cool.

675
00:50:56,738 --> 00:51:01,443
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be five games that will start coming out on February 18th each week.

676
00:51:02,164 --> 00:51:04,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to include the following titles.

677
00:51:04,566 --> 00:51:06,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Beyond Good and Evil HD.

678
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:11,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Hardcore Uprising.

679
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,495
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that Contra game that's kind of anime style now.

680
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:15,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Bejeweled Blitz Live.

681
00:51:16,078 --> 00:51:17,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Full House Poker Torchlight Xbox Live Arcade

682
00:51:45,962 --> 00:51:48,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I am so excited about Torchlight coming.

683
00:51:50,463 --> 00:51:51,063
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be sweet.

684
00:51:51,444 --> 00:51:55,805
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's going to be weird because Torchlight is very PC.

685
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:57,325
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

686
00:51:57,465 --> 00:52:00,066
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you've never played it, it's basically Diablo 2.

687
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:03,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how else to explain it.

688
00:52:03,947 --> 00:52:09,448
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of that same kind of like dungeon crawl and lots of keys do different things.

689
00:52:09,788 --> 00:52:14,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think they've talked about with this coming Xbox Live Arcade, they've practically revamped the whole battle system.

690
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:16,170
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

691
00:52:44,878 --> 00:52:51,502
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, they're going to kind of trick me into buying the same game twice because I have it on PC and now I kind of want it on Xbox Live Arcade.

692
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:51,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it!

693
00:52:52,243 --> 00:52:52,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it!

694
00:52:53,023 --> 00:52:53,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

695
00:52:53,544 --> 00:52:55,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been tricked into buying this game twice.

696
00:52:55,945 --> 00:52:56,826
[SPEAKER_08]: What about you, chatters?

697
00:52:57,106 --> 00:53:02,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of you guys play Torchlight on your PC and yet you think you're going to buy this on Xbox Live Arcade as well?

698
00:53:02,589 --> 00:53:04,851
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm curious about.

699
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:08,071
[SPEAKER_08]: What were some of the other games that were coming out?

700
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:09,893
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all Torchlight Torchlight to me.

701
00:53:10,293 --> 00:53:12,855
[SPEAKER_08]: But Jewel Blitz Live.

702
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:14,056
[SPEAKER_05]: They have that.

703
00:53:14,597 --> 00:53:16,198
[SPEAKER_05]: That game's free to play on Facebook.

704
00:53:16,218 --> 00:53:17,859
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to charge me to play it on Xbox Live?

705
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:18,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

706
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Bastards.

707
00:53:20,441 --> 00:53:21,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Beyond Good and Evil HD.

708
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people are Beyond Good and Evil fans.

709
00:53:24,044 --> 00:53:24,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'll be a big one.

710
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:27,507
[SPEAKER_05]: What else?

711
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's that new poker game.

712
00:53:29,268 --> 00:53:30,870
[SPEAKER_05]: That was from Microsoft.

713
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's the one versus 100 replacement, isn't it?

714
00:53:33,232 --> 00:53:33,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

715
00:53:33,492 --> 00:53:33,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

716
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:38,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Bochikawa in our chatroom says, Torchlight with Kinect support?

717
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:40,240
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be really fun.

718
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it uses Kinect.

719
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so either.

720
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,722
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an interesting thought, though, is that what if instead of a mouse, it was your hand?

721
00:53:47,242 --> 00:53:52,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could just move your hand around and click by, like, just thrusting your hand forward or something?

722
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:52,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

723
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:53,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be interesting.

724
00:53:54,504 --> 00:53:57,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Dartetsuya reminded us that Diablo was on the PlayStation.

725
00:53:57,665 --> 00:53:59,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at how Diablo worked on the PlayStation.

726
00:53:59,225 --> 00:54:01,006
[SPEAKER_08]: They just changed the controls to work with a controller.

727
00:54:01,431 --> 00:54:03,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Activision Blizzard, and Zynga

728
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,572
[SPEAKER_08]: What do these two companies possibly have in common where they're both being sued?

729
00:54:37,933 --> 00:54:45,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Walker Digital, which was founded by Jay Walker, who also made Priceline.com, is behind this suit.

730
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:46,997
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe it's not just any old troll.

731
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:49,338
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a troll with a big website.

732
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:57,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Zynga and Activision violate the patent, which is a database-driven online distributed tournament system.

733
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:24,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Walker is saying that the part of this that has been violated is the part of the patent that says there is a quote method of conducting a distributed electronic tournament for a plurality of players and World of Warcraft, Call of Duty Black Ops which is Activision which is part of Blizzard, Mafia Wars and all these games have these tournaments in them

734
00:55:25,598 --> 00:55:30,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of odd that StarCraft isn't mentioned because when I think tournaments, I don't think WoW, I think StarCraft, but whatever.

735
00:55:32,564 --> 00:55:34,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess violates this patent.

736
00:55:36,863 --> 00:55:41,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I'm starting to think with all these stories I read that patent stuff is a need for reform.

737
00:55:41,526 --> 00:55:44,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I think whatever judge reviews that needs to just tell him to bite his ass.

738
00:55:44,347 --> 00:55:47,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and it probably will get laughed out of court, as a lot of these recent ones have.

739
00:55:47,489 --> 00:55:49,691
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're asking for a full trial or whatever.

740
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:50,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

741
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:53,733
[SPEAKER_08]: If this guy had the technology years ago or whatever, that's fine.

742
00:55:53,793 --> 00:55:59,636
[SPEAKER_08]: If you were the one that thought of it, I guess, although I somehow don't think these companies have implemented it quite the same way.

743
00:56:00,397 --> 00:56:01,558
[SPEAKER_08]: And just the fact that...

744
00:56:02,538 --> 00:56:04,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you patent something and then do nothing with it?

745
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:05,759
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what bothers.

746
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:13,682
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what makes you look like a troll, is you're just waiting for someone to actually put a good idea to use, and then you get to sue the pants off of them.

747
00:56:14,842 --> 00:56:15,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

748
00:56:15,983 --> 00:56:20,184
[SPEAKER_08]: A little silly to me, and I'm sure it's a little silly to all of you as well.

749
00:56:21,605 --> 00:56:22,825
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

750
00:56:24,186 --> 00:56:25,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've got a few other things.

751
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:27,687
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Mario All-Stars?

752
00:56:29,858 --> 00:56:31,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it sold out.

753
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:33,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And copies are going for $80 on eBay.

754
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:36,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're talking about more reprints.

755
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So we might be seeing it going.

756
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,700
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they have not sold out in the UK.

757
00:56:41,141 --> 00:56:45,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can still get your copy on Amazon UK for $17.99.

758
00:56:47,402 --> 00:56:49,383
[SPEAKER_04]: So people in Europe, stockpile.

759
00:56:50,743 --> 00:56:52,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're coming after your supply.

760
00:56:52,724 --> 00:56:58,665
[SPEAKER_08]: And people here in the US, you're going to be really sorry buying these for $80 on eBay if they end up reprinting them, which they probably will.

761
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:11,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I mean, basically, Mark Franklin, who's the head of Nintendo PR, said that they're thinking about bringing it back in reprints.

762
00:57:12,931 --> 00:57:15,092
[SPEAKER_04]: So they definitely want to make more money, and people will buy them.

763
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:16,712
[SPEAKER_04]: The market's there.

764
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:21,694
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure there's got to be a lot of us sitting here going, who is buying this?

765
00:57:21,854 --> 00:57:26,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Because seriously... It's a port of a game that was out on the SNES.

766
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:26,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

767
00:57:27,369 --> 00:57:28,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's this.

768
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:32,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan turned to me a while back and said, Hey, you want this game?

769
00:57:32,654 --> 00:57:32,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

770
00:57:32,894 --> 00:57:33,875
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got it on the SNES.

771
00:57:35,136 --> 00:57:40,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think we were talking about wanting the special edition or something because it came with shit, but why?

772
00:57:41,451 --> 00:57:44,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I guarantee that you can buy a Super Nintendo and the game for less than $80.

773
00:57:44,352 --> 00:57:45,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, I'm sure you can.

774
00:58:11,356 --> 00:58:12,877
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is easy to find.

775
00:58:13,077 --> 00:58:17,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it wasn't like of super limited production or anything, but you can find them.

776
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people don't understand that.

777
00:58:20,241 --> 00:58:21,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've got two copies.

778
00:58:21,262 --> 00:58:21,962
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Wii.

779
00:58:22,382 --> 00:58:23,983
[SPEAKER_04]: If I have another copy, I'll send it to somebody.

780
00:58:24,643 --> 00:58:30,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is hard for people that listen to this show to understand because you all are very gaming aware.

781
00:58:30,387 --> 00:58:32,308
[SPEAKER_08]: You're culturally aware of the gaming community.

782
00:58:32,768 --> 00:58:36,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot of people out there that honestly don't understand that.

783
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:46,717
[SPEAKER_08]: they don't think you can buy Super Nintendos anymore or they think that well it's on the Wii it's a Wii version it's different no it's not they don't know that

784
00:58:48,226 --> 00:58:49,887
[SPEAKER_08]: All they know is that the game is on the Wii now.

785
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:52,688
[SPEAKER_04]: We are expert analysts of video games.

786
00:58:53,168 --> 00:58:53,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust us.

787
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:55,289
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing.

788
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:59,831
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like when they re-released The Wizard of Oz into theaters for a limited run.

789
00:59:00,531 --> 00:59:03,232
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same damn movie.

790
00:59:03,432 --> 00:59:04,573
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't put anything back.

791
00:59:05,093 --> 00:59:07,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Dorothy suddenly does not go home.

792
00:59:07,934 --> 00:59:08,474
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

793
00:59:08,514 --> 00:59:10,015
[SPEAKER_08]: She still clicks her heels three times.

794
00:59:10,035 --> 00:59:11,135
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be fucking hilarious.

795
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:12,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Change the ending.

796
00:59:12,936 --> 00:59:14,597
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, the movie is still the same.

797
00:59:14,957 --> 00:59:15,477
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

798
00:59:15,837 --> 00:59:16,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing's changed.

799
00:59:17,738 --> 00:59:22,861
[SPEAKER_04]: They changed the ending and she's actually in the insane asylum like in the second movie.

800
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:26,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly truly think people don't know that you can go out and still buy the game.

801
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:30,185
[SPEAKER_08]: They think that, oh, they've re-released this now and I can get it on my Wii for my kids.

802
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:32,186
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be listening to our podcast.

803
00:59:33,287 --> 00:59:33,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't they?

804
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:36,950
[SPEAKER_08]: and some folks in the chat room seem to agree with me.

805
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:42,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Tigerclaw says, true, and people who never bought a Mario game in their life, this will be their first entry to Mario.

806
00:59:42,632 --> 00:59:47,654
[SPEAKER_08]: DDRDollarBill says, here's the thing, casual players aren't going to go out and find a Super Nintendo and then find the games.

807
00:59:48,774 --> 00:59:50,475
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't know how to hunt at a free market.

808
00:59:50,895 --> 00:59:51,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

809
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:51,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Lazy.

810
00:59:51,895 --> 00:59:53,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo is taking advantage of lazy people.

811
00:59:56,822 --> 01:00:00,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Every industry out there takes advantage of people being lazy.

812
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:03,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Infomercials exist.

813
01:00:04,205 --> 01:00:11,489
[SPEAKER_04]: They create problems for people that people didn't have before so that they can sell them a product for a problem they didn't have.

814
01:00:12,028 --> 01:00:18,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for reminding me because I actually have a problem with my cat not being able to get high enough on our windows so I had to go buy a sunny seat for it.

815
01:00:20,154 --> 01:00:20,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Your cat can live.

816
01:00:21,055 --> 01:00:21,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cat.

817
01:00:22,296 --> 01:00:24,077
[SPEAKER_05]: She needs to be higher up on the window.

818
01:00:24,237 --> 01:00:26,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Shermie sits on the damn floor.

819
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:27,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Cats desire height.

820
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,982
[SPEAKER_04]: When she wants sunlight, she goes and sits in front of the door.

821
01:00:30,653 --> 01:00:59,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I think some of the greatest company ideas out there are formed on how can I allow people to be more lazy like let me give you an example there's companies out there that will do takeout for any type of food and they just charge like a surcharge we have something called takeout taxi yeah any restaurant in the world and get you takeout food now here's the thing not everybody who uses that is lazy because certainly you have homebound people sick people people who don't have driver's license people who are studying for their finals yeah exactly

822
01:00:59,716 --> 01:01:02,718
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll betcha that's 10% of who's using it.

823
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:03,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

824
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,140
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I understand.

825
01:01:06,922 --> 01:01:11,085
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, I don't want to start ranting again.

826
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:11,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

827
01:01:11,726 --> 01:01:12,766
[SPEAKER_08]: No, please, rant.

828
01:01:12,806 --> 01:01:14,948
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't had good rants in a long time on this show.

829
01:01:15,028 --> 01:01:19,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't people just get off their asses and just put effort into shit, you know?

830
01:01:20,012 --> 01:01:26,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Because then I have to look away from my farm and my plants on my farmville will die.

831
01:01:26,537 --> 01:01:28,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just ranting, Rob.

832
01:01:31,364 --> 01:01:38,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing is going to equal the experience of sitting down and playing the game on the Super Nintendo with the right controller.

833
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:40,872
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not going to be the same.

834
01:01:43,774 --> 01:01:46,156
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole reason why we didn't get the new Donkey Kong, Rob.

835
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,037
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because you can't play it with a classic controller.

836
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:50,279
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Donkey Kong.

837
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,361
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do the little shaky thing.

838
01:01:54,042 --> 01:01:55,583
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want to put motion control in it.

839
01:01:55,643 --> 01:01:56,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Miyamoto made them.

840
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,118
[SPEAKER_04]: That's retarded.

841
01:02:00,298 --> 01:02:02,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to sit down and play a game that doesn't have motion control.

842
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,163
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to wear my pajamas while I'm doing it so I can be lazy playing it the way it's meant to be played.

843
01:02:09,964 --> 01:02:11,365
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll go to effort to be lazy.

844
01:02:12,085 --> 01:02:15,827
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's a really interesting comment here from Xlink in our chat room?

845
01:02:16,348 --> 01:02:17,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Netflix is another company.

846
01:02:18,589 --> 01:02:24,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And he didn't really put context to that, so I'm assuming it means Netflix kind of made their money off lazy things.

847
01:02:25,113 --> 01:02:25,713
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

848
01:02:25,793 --> 01:02:25,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

849
01:02:27,194 --> 01:02:32,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I can definitely see that end of it, but I don't know if I'd necessarily call it lazy as much as it is damn convenient.

850
01:02:33,939 --> 01:02:36,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Because what did we have to do before?

851
01:02:36,481 --> 01:02:39,444
[SPEAKER_08]: You had to get out, get in your car, go to the video store, and so forth.

852
01:02:40,064 --> 01:02:43,127
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more convenience, in my opinion.

853
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:45,909
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also kind of the subscriber fee.

854
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:53,455
[SPEAKER_08]: When Blockbuster had their stores, not until the end, after Netflix was out, did they have these monthly fees where you could rent all the movies you wanted.

855
01:02:55,136 --> 01:02:57,358
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why people like Netflix from what I understood.

856
01:02:57,378 --> 01:03:00,321
[SPEAKER_08]: They could send one movie away and there'd be another one waiting for them.

857
01:03:00,461 --> 01:03:06,607
[SPEAKER_08]: I can kind of take that going to Blockbuster out of my daily routine and watch more movies.

858
01:03:07,187 --> 01:03:09,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I would call that lazy, though.

859
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:12,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess it is in a way.

860
01:03:13,673 --> 01:03:15,715
[SPEAKER_04]: People are convenience-centric.

861
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:18,638
[SPEAKER_04]: They're focused on convenience.

862
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:19,478
[SPEAKER_04]: And

863
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:32,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of miss going to Blockbuster and looking at the movies and reading the backs of them and everything and going to rent my games and the special rental only versions of stuff.

864
01:03:32,452 --> 01:03:37,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's still like one Blockbuster in every town if you want to do that.

865
01:03:37,658 --> 01:03:38,859
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just farther away now.

866
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:40,676
[SPEAKER_04]: and the fucking Redbox thing.

867
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:42,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate the Redbox.

868
01:03:43,638 --> 01:03:47,120
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why my husband doesn't have a job as a freaking Redbox.

869
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:48,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Hate it.

870
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:50,582
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not really a big fan of Redbox either.

871
01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:58,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, in my opinion, you should go out to a blockbuster if you're going to use something like Redbox.

872
01:03:58,318 --> 01:03:59,358
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that different.

873
01:03:59,658 --> 01:04:06,323
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what the other problem is, too, is that I think that there's a sort of forced isolation going on people, you know?

874
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:16,090
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be you had to get out and be in society and be a part of things, but now it's like, everyone's an individual and we have to cater to everybody and...

875
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Political Correct, and blah, blah, blah.

876
01:04:19,032 --> 01:04:24,255
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it's a matter of you're removing the human element from the equation.

877
01:04:25,276 --> 01:04:26,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, good point from Frisbee in our chat room.

878
01:04:27,057 --> 01:04:28,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Netflix eliminated the late fees.

879
01:04:28,878 --> 01:04:30,219
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why it got so popular.

880
01:04:30,339 --> 01:04:31,259
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very good point.

881
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,601
[SPEAKER_04]: But do you see what I mean?

882
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:34,101
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I do.

883
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:35,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

884
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to make sure our chatters.

885
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:37,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Every gamer has a voice.

886
01:04:37,203 --> 01:04:37,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta get their voice.

887
01:04:37,823 --> 01:04:41,446
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, even with World of Warcraft, going back to that, you're...

888
01:04:43,072 --> 01:04:44,113
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

889
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:01,771
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I like to do both, but sometimes it's not practical.

890
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:02,632
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

891
01:05:02,652 --> 01:05:06,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Like sometimes I'm playing these games with people that live halfway across the country, all the way across the country.

892
01:05:06,453 --> 01:05:07,034
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

893
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:07,694
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one thing.

894
01:05:07,734 --> 01:05:11,896
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm saying how many people in the guild live in town or near town?

895
01:05:12,616 --> 01:05:15,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's, you know, one point.

896
01:05:15,777 --> 01:05:21,400
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be that we would, all of us would get together like twice a week and play DDR or go to the arcade and something.

897
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:22,580
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's just like, oh, I'll see you online.

898
01:05:23,661 --> 01:05:24,541
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened to hanging out?

899
01:05:25,481 --> 01:05:26,742
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened to good old fashioned hanging out?

900
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:34,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the other thing with all of this is just that it's removing the personal element from everything.

901
01:05:34,552 --> 01:05:39,342
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a convenience-driven society and we also don't like dealing with people because it's inconvenient.

902
01:05:41,846 --> 01:05:42,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, more ranting.

903
01:05:43,848 --> 01:05:50,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet, yet, there's a stigma in our society that we all need to be skinny and beautiful because only skinny is beautiful.

904
01:05:50,533 --> 01:06:02,382
[SPEAKER_08]: But the realistic end of it is that with how much we are lazy and convenience-driven, it ought to be that sitting at home all day getting really, really...

905
01:06:03,823 --> 01:06:05,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when Big Betts were in?

906
01:06:05,624 --> 01:06:06,624
[SPEAKER_08]: You have that magnet.

907
01:06:34,211 --> 01:06:35,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I like big butts and I cannot lie.

908
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:37,494
[SPEAKER_08]: You other brothers can't deny.

909
01:06:37,534 --> 01:06:38,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you liked boobs.

910
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:39,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on.

911
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:40,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Release dates.

912
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:43,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's travel around the world and see what is conveniently coming out to a store near you.

913
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:48,314
[SPEAKER_05]: PC, Playstation 3, Xbox 360 Ghost Trick Phantom Detective Nintendo DS Ace Attorney

914
01:07:08,714 --> 01:07:22,367
[SPEAKER_05]: DC Universe, they're going to have that available on PlayStation 3 and PC, both the regular and collector's editions of those Prinny 2, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude, on PSP What?

915
01:07:24,289 --> 01:07:28,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Say that again Prinny 2, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude

916
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:34,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Prinnies are the little guys in the Disgaea, little penguin dudes, right?

917
01:07:35,003 --> 01:07:35,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

918
01:07:35,443 --> 01:07:37,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is about Operation Panties?

919
01:07:38,204 --> 01:07:41,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.

920
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:46,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, like what the fuck happened to this series when I wasn't watching it?

921
01:07:46,449 --> 01:07:50,271
[SPEAKER_08]: So like now there's a game coming out where the little penguins are going on a panty raid.

922
01:07:50,471 --> 01:07:51,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I correct?

923
01:07:52,433 --> 01:07:53,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

924
01:07:53,953 --> 01:07:55,554
[SPEAKER_08]: What is Operation Panties?

925
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:56,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea.

926
01:07:56,575 --> 01:07:56,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

927
01:07:59,147 --> 01:07:59,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, keep going.

928
01:08:00,348 --> 01:08:01,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to do some research.

929
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:03,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Kingdom Hearts Recoded.

930
01:08:03,471 --> 01:08:05,532
[SPEAKER_05]: That's coming out on Nintendo DS this week.

931
01:08:09,496 --> 01:08:15,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Spellforce 2, Faith and Destiny on PC.

932
01:08:17,142 --> 01:08:17,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see...

933
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,401
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's basically it.

934
01:08:23,461 --> 01:08:24,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week, lots of good stuff.

935
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:26,623
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's for next week.

936
01:08:26,923 --> 01:08:28,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the week after next, I should say.

937
01:08:29,504 --> 01:08:31,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I want me some LittleBigPlanet 2.

938
01:08:32,045 --> 01:08:36,147
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no wiki entry on Prinny 2, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.

939
01:08:36,888 --> 01:08:39,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to find more information on this.

940
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:40,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing Google.

941
01:08:40,489 --> 01:08:41,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a minute.

942
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:42,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

943
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:44,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, there's something on the PlayStation blog.

944
01:08:44,991 --> 01:08:45,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what this is all about.

945
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:52,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Printy 2 is a side-scrolling hack-and-slash action game and you can play as Printy.

946
01:08:52,572 --> 01:08:56,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Your mission this time is to find the precious panties of Demon Lord Etna.

947
01:08:57,535 --> 01:09:04,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you have to search for Etna's panties, or Etna swears that she will skin all printies and make them into panties.

948
01:09:05,179 --> 01:09:08,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now that I think of that, pretty panties would be kind of cool, but not for the printies.

949
01:09:09,761 --> 01:09:15,864
[SPEAKER_08]: You must find her panties by following morning in the game so you don't have any time to dilly-dally.

950
01:09:15,924 --> 01:09:16,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to it, dude.

951
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:22,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Words escape me, folks.

952
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,510
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what gaming has become.

953
01:09:25,651 --> 01:09:26,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at your life.

954
01:09:26,591 --> 01:09:31,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at your choices.

955
01:09:31,253 --> 01:09:31,973
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing?

956
01:09:37,275 --> 01:09:39,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Insolacious Pop is chiming in there.

957
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:42,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Etna, the demon girl, was in Disgaea.

958
01:09:42,117 --> 01:09:45,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Her panties are missing and you fight an action platformer to find them.

959
01:09:45,579 --> 01:09:47,559
[SPEAKER_08]: But with panties, like in Ghosts and Goblins.

960
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Ghosts and Goblins and panties.

961
01:09:52,236 --> 01:09:53,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I can't.

962
01:09:57,018 --> 01:10:02,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, you know what, this game probably deserves to sell more copies than a lot of the stuff out there.

963
01:10:02,461 --> 01:10:05,082
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, hooray for them for giving gamers what they really want.

964
01:10:05,162 --> 01:10:05,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Panties.

965
01:10:06,963 --> 01:10:10,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on to Japan and talk about some of the crazy games coming out over there.

966
01:10:11,385 --> 01:10:15,307
[SPEAKER_08]: On the Xbox 360, Arcana Heart 3 is making its way out this week.

967
01:10:15,367 --> 01:10:17,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Arcana Heart, that's the all chick fighters, right?

968
01:10:18,852 --> 01:10:20,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, number three is coming out.

969
01:10:21,273 --> 01:10:22,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Panties will fly!

970
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:26,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Or at least they will in my brain.

971
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:31,757
[SPEAKER_08]: James Bond Bloodstone comes out on 360 this week as well as Mass Effect 2, the Japanese edition.

972
01:10:32,417 --> 01:10:34,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Took them a little while to localize it for those guys.

973
01:10:34,878 --> 01:10:38,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Stoked, Big Air edition also on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

974
01:10:38,999 --> 01:10:44,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And a very limited edition Arcana Heart 3 arcade stick coming out as well.

975
01:10:46,589 --> 01:10:49,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming out on the PlayStation 3.

976
01:10:50,452 --> 01:10:53,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Arcana Heart 3 gets a version there as well, and a joystick.

977
01:10:54,074 --> 01:10:58,176
[SPEAKER_08]: And James Bond Bloodstone also coming out on the PlayStation 3 in Japan.

978
01:10:58,677 --> 01:11:00,378
[SPEAKER_08]: So the releases kind of mirror each other there.

979
01:11:00,838 --> 01:11:02,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing on the Wii this week.

980
01:11:02,219 --> 01:11:08,103
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, things are kind of quiet from Nintendo until we get to the last story in a couple weeks.

981
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:11,725
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, Nintendo's going to be all about the 3DS in Japan in just a little bit.

982
01:11:12,065 --> 01:11:12,545
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

983
01:11:38,813 --> 01:11:53,338
[SPEAKER_08]: This game is like that old game Go, but with one of the world's experts, who's this kind of cute chick in her cyber form helping you to play that old game.

984
01:11:54,558 --> 01:11:56,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Does she strip down naked if I do well?

985
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:57,619
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not strip Go.

986
01:11:57,759 --> 01:11:58,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Get your mind out of the gutter.

987
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Not interested.

988
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:06,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Black Robina comes out this week from one of my favorite named companies over there.

989
01:12:06,182 --> 01:12:06,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Broccoli.

990
01:12:06,482 --> 01:12:06,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Broccoli.

991
01:12:09,011 --> 01:12:09,491
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what else?

992
01:12:09,532 --> 01:12:10,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Broccoli did.

993
01:12:10,232 --> 01:12:10,592
[SPEAKER_08]: What else?

994
01:12:10,773 --> 01:12:11,273
[SPEAKER_04]: DigiCarrot.

995
01:12:12,154 --> 01:12:12,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah.

996
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're doing Black Robina on the PSP this week.

997
01:12:15,797 --> 01:12:17,018
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for Japanese releases.

998
01:12:18,099 --> 01:12:20,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for Europe, there's a few.

999
01:12:20,881 --> 01:12:24,825
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Zite on Xbox 360 for the 12th.

1000
01:12:25,285 --> 01:12:28,548
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 14th is DC Universe Online and Ghost Trick.

1001
01:12:29,129 --> 01:12:30,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And also Kingdom Hearts Recoded.

1002
01:12:31,691 --> 01:12:32,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

1003
01:12:34,775 --> 01:12:38,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're almost to the classic game of the week, but first, a couple more stories for you guys.

1004
01:12:39,224 --> 01:12:42,852
[SPEAKER_08]: And this next story, you're going to want to remember this when we get into Part B tonight.

1005
01:12:43,513 --> 01:12:52,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, THQ has partnered with Mattel and they're going to be doing some brand new licensed games based on their properties.

1006
01:12:53,403 --> 01:13:02,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, some of the deals that they have in place already, well, they've already got some stuff, I guess.

1007
01:13:03,934 --> 01:13:06,197
[SPEAKER_05]: He-Man by the power of Greyskull.

1008
01:13:07,927 --> 01:13:09,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of cool.

1009
01:13:10,132 --> 01:13:15,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they haven't really said what other rights they're also going to be working with.

1010
01:13:15,463 --> 01:13:15,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess...

1011
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:45,067
[SPEAKER_05]: let's see here they said Barbie, Hot Wheels it's kind of odd because Barbie and Hot Wheels right now Activision kind of has the rights to those because they've been making games for them for a while now mainly the Barbie stuff off of the DVD movies if you believe it or not they keep releasing DVD movies for Barbie stuff Fisher Price, Rock'em Sock'em Robots Masters of the Universe and Polly Pocket um

1012
01:13:46,880 --> 01:14:08,889
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course, you know, people are wondering also, they're gonna be maybe doing some tie-ins with the U-Draw game tablet, because they do have that by the way so I don't know, it's interesting I wonder if they're gonna be doing any off the new Masters of the Universe series is that even still around?

1013
01:14:10,789 --> 01:14:12,150
[SPEAKER_05]: do they show it in reruns?

1014
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,871
[SPEAKER_08]: weren't they supposed to be opting a new movie or something for that?

1015
01:14:15,987 --> 01:14:17,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Dolph Lundgren needs more work.

1016
01:14:19,495 --> 01:14:20,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm serious, man.

1017
01:14:20,979 --> 01:14:22,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't he like senile by now?

1018
01:14:22,362 --> 01:14:23,464
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got to be getting pretty old.

1019
01:14:24,066 --> 01:14:25,349
[SPEAKER_08]: He was in Expendables.

1020
01:14:25,489 --> 01:14:26,271
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not that old.

1021
01:14:26,638 --> 01:14:28,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Expendables was different though.

1022
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,201
[SPEAKER_08]: It brought back everybody for that movie.

1023
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:32,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're all pretty old.

1024
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:32,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1025
01:14:33,563 --> 01:14:35,485
[SPEAKER_08]: One more story for you guys, then the classic game of the week.

1026
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:47,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And this has to do with some big announcements at Consumer Electronics Show this week, which usually isn't a gaming show per se, but a few things will always get slipped in there because of course gaming consoles are what's in your living room.

1027
01:14:48,214 --> 01:15:15,928
[SPEAKER_08]: and one place that gaming consoles have really expanded beyond just the place you play video games is being an entertainment device letting you watch movies and Netflix on them and Microsoft talked a little bit about Netflix expansion coming this spring Netflix will get Kinect enabled so you'll be able to flail your arms to queue up episodes of Veronica Mars if that's how you choose to do it I bet this will be one of those things where you use it a couple times to impress your friends and then you're done with it

1028
01:15:16,348 --> 01:15:17,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1029
01:15:41,153 --> 01:15:42,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe next year's CES.

1030
01:15:42,434 --> 01:15:42,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1031
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:46,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Also announced, though, is that Hulu will be coming to Xbox.

1032
01:15:46,758 --> 01:15:52,764
[SPEAKER_08]: It's out on the PlayStation, but Hulu Plus will be coming to the Xbox 360 at the same time later this spring.

1033
01:15:53,284 --> 01:15:53,985
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

1034
01:15:54,806 --> 01:15:56,988
[SPEAKER_08]: One other little tidbit that was dropped in the press conference.

1035
01:15:57,668 --> 01:16:02,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember how Microsoft had a goal of selling 5 million Kinect units by Christmas?

1036
01:16:03,273 --> 01:16:07,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they came out at CES and said they sold 8 million units.

1037
01:16:07,637 --> 01:16:15,722
[SPEAKER_08]: But some people have said, wait a minute, did you really sell 8 million units or did you push 8 million units out there to retailers?

1038
01:16:16,383 --> 01:16:16,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1039
01:16:17,563 --> 01:16:21,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, regardless of however the numbers are being skewed, it still is a fairly impressive amount.

1040
01:16:21,986 --> 01:16:27,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I guarantee if they, I think those are sold numbers because they haven't been sitting on shelves.

1041
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:28,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it that way.

1042
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:29,371
[SPEAKER_05]: They're hard to find.

1043
01:16:30,842 --> 01:16:33,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, and who knew?

1044
01:16:33,985 --> 01:16:41,391
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people thought that that was going to be a high number for them to break because that's way more than they sold 360s in the first year.

1045
01:16:41,411 --> 01:16:45,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, 360s were really hard to get at that time, so I don't know.

1046
01:16:45,374 --> 01:16:46,395
[SPEAKER_05]: These are still hard to get.

1047
01:16:47,335 --> 01:16:47,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they really?

1048
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:49,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm spoiled.

1049
01:16:49,597 --> 01:16:50,838
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems that way at least.

1050
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:52,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not for retailers.

1051
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:55,862
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty easy to get for them.

1052
01:16:55,882 --> 01:16:56,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1053
01:16:56,903 --> 01:17:04,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how everybody in our chatroom at chat.orangenetradio.com is coming out with their own ideas for what Kinect should do on voice command.

1054
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:07,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Like DDR Dollar Bill says, Kinect, get me a beer.

1055
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:11,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Frisbee in our chatroom says, computer, end holodeck.

1056
01:17:13,998 --> 01:17:18,422
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Dollar Bill says, Kinect, ban this douchebag who called me a racial slur.

1057
01:17:21,165 --> 01:17:22,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Someday, someday.

1058
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,596
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw, Xbox, play Tron.

1059
01:17:27,117 --> 01:17:27,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Tron.

1060
01:17:27,878 --> 01:17:28,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Tron.

1061
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:29,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I said Tron, damn it.

1062
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:31,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it would be like the voice recognition on the DS.

1063
01:17:32,043 --> 01:17:32,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue.

1064
01:17:33,665 --> 01:17:34,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue.

1065
01:17:35,247 --> 01:17:35,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Brew.

1066
01:17:38,772 --> 01:17:39,673
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1067
01:17:58,072 --> 01:18:16,708
[SPEAKER_08]: you should put down all those newfangled holiday toys and your 3DSs and play games the way we used to when we had to walk barefoot through the snow both ways 20 miles up the river and eat our grape nuts to play these games I'm still hungry Rob, all I've had is pizza

1068
01:18:17,816 --> 01:18:20,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?

1069
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Fury.

1070
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:24,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically, Space Fury on the ColecoVision.

1071
01:18:25,978 --> 01:18:28,539
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to play a little bit of, you have to play the opening taunt.

1072
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:29,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that music.

1073
01:18:29,779 --> 01:18:30,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1074
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the screen where you select your difficulty.

1075
01:18:45,336 --> 01:18:45,616
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1076
01:19:00,996 --> 01:19:03,858
[SPEAKER_04]: It was put out by Sega on June 17th, 1981.

1077
01:19:03,978 --> 01:19:09,261
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a rotate left, rotate right, and thrust and fire.

1078
01:19:09,921 --> 01:19:20,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, it kind of plays like Asteroids, but as you go through the game, you actually can get a little armored unit that takes you into different levels of different things you can shoot.

1079
01:19:20,487 --> 01:19:29,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Except that these little segments combine into a bigger segment, and then you have to blow up the smaller segments and stuff, but they can blow you up.

1080
01:19:29,992 --> 01:19:33,613
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like a little bit Time Pilot, which kind of was Asteroids-inspired, too.

1081
01:19:33,633 --> 01:19:36,014
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like between the two.

1082
01:19:36,394 --> 01:19:38,634
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as the arcade, the arcade version was Vector.

1083
01:19:39,054 --> 01:19:40,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, this one's not Vector.

1084
01:19:42,075 --> 01:19:49,217
[SPEAKER_04]: But the arcade version, it was Vector on an XY monitor, and it ran on the Sega G80 arcade system.

1085
01:19:49,237 --> 01:19:54,779
[SPEAKER_04]: It had some of the best lines in it, like, So, a creature for my amusement, prepare for battle!

1086
01:19:56,819 --> 01:20:00,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And my favorite one is... And I keep in mind, my mother was great at this game.

1087
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:02,802
[SPEAKER_04]: She played a lot of freaking Space Fury.

1088
01:20:04,283 --> 01:20:10,226
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, when you win the game, basically the last thing that you get is, Our battle has concluded, warrior.

1089
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,327
[SPEAKER_04]: You were a stimulating opponent.

1090
01:20:13,848 --> 01:20:18,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And the alien in this also appears in a video game called Zector.

1091
01:20:19,131 --> 01:20:24,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, for the Clicovision version, of course, it's sprite-based.

1092
01:20:24,214 --> 01:20:24,874
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know...

1093
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:29,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really early video game system.

1094
01:20:29,164 --> 01:20:30,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what else I can say about that.

1095
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:40,571
[SPEAKER_04]: But you use the little... Because it had the keypad controller, so you'd actually thrust and go with your little side shoulders and fire that the same way.

1096
01:20:41,632 --> 01:20:43,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And move around.

1097
01:20:43,353 --> 01:20:44,853
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually kind of hard to control.

1098
01:20:45,394 --> 01:20:50,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I was not good at this game, but like I said, a lot of this game happened in my house.

1099
01:20:51,077 --> 01:20:54,659
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can get power-ups for shooting and get extra...

1100
01:21:01,644 --> 01:21:07,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this game and I played it on the ColecoVision actually.

1101
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:10,307
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the games I really enjoyed playing.

1102
01:21:10,327 --> 01:21:12,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I never had a ColecoVision growing up.

1103
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:13,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got two.

1104
01:21:13,748 --> 01:21:14,448
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to borrow one?

1105
01:21:15,248 --> 01:21:16,429
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not growing up anymore.

1106
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:18,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, come on, Rob.

1107
01:21:18,169 --> 01:21:19,349
[SPEAKER_04]: We know you're still growing up.

1108
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:20,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I am.

1109
01:21:23,371 --> 01:21:24,471
[SPEAKER_04]: This is when it talked to you.

1110
01:21:26,492 --> 01:21:27,672
[SPEAKER_08]: The voice is so realistic.

1111
01:21:30,936 --> 01:21:32,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep

1112
01:21:41,303 --> 01:21:45,284
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, your classic game of the week this week is Space Fury.

1113
01:21:46,124 --> 01:21:49,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Good pick, even if it's not one I'm super familiar with.

1114
01:21:49,165 --> 01:21:52,226
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked very interesting, so I will have to check it out this week.

1115
01:21:52,246 --> 01:21:53,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've already done GORF, haven't I?

1116
01:21:54,027 --> 01:21:54,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you have.

1117
01:21:54,787 --> 01:21:55,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you have.

1118
01:21:55,587 --> 01:21:57,708
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we're going to take a quick break, guys, but don't go anywhere.

1119
01:21:57,728 --> 01:22:00,689
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio in Part B tonight.

1120
01:22:01,009 --> 01:22:09,351
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do some quick, quick news, including some news on what's going on with APB, Bionic Commando Rearm 2 we got some news on,

1121
01:22:09,851 --> 01:22:21,396
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get some other news stories tonight about the Mac App Store, of course, your Twitter topics, the mailbag, and because DarkSakura specifically asked for it before the show started tonight, we're going to do a list list tonight.

1122
01:22:21,817 --> 01:22:25,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you were paying attention in part A because it has to do with what our list list is about.

1123
01:22:25,478 --> 01:22:29,160
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll tell you all about that when we come right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1124
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:38,202
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

1125
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:57,501
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1126
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:20,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not soon, but it will come out and that will be a must-have.

1127
01:23:20,551 --> 01:23:23,593
[SPEAKER_08]: But Blu-rays that came out recently that I need to see.

1128
01:23:23,733 --> 01:23:24,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have not seen this movie.

1129
01:23:24,853 --> 01:23:25,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you believe it?

1130
01:23:25,473 --> 01:23:25,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Inception?

1131
01:23:26,914 --> 01:23:28,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I still haven't seen it and I need to.

1132
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:29,575
[SPEAKER_05]: You do need to see that.

1133
01:23:29,595 --> 01:23:30,456
[SPEAKER_05]: That is pretty awesome.

1134
01:23:30,496 --> 01:23:32,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard nothing but great things about that movie.

1135
01:23:32,356 --> 01:23:35,097
[SPEAKER_08]: And now that the Blu-ray is out, I'm going to need to see that.

1136
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:38,019
[SPEAKER_05]: It is absolutely something you should see.

1137
01:23:38,839 --> 01:23:41,540
[SPEAKER_05]: That was something else I missed in D-Box.

1138
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,341
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been a good movie in D-Box.

1139
01:23:45,955 --> 01:23:46,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

1140
01:23:47,376 --> 01:23:49,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, D-Box is kind of really, really new, isn't it?

1141
01:23:49,799 --> 01:23:50,799
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really, really new, yeah.

1142
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,422
[SPEAKER_08]: The theater out here that has it is brand spanking new.

1143
01:23:53,702 --> 01:23:58,687
[SPEAKER_05]: It's brand spanking new, and it's only in one theater, and it's only one row of seats.

1144
01:23:59,247 --> 01:24:01,730
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two rows of seats in the theater I was in.

1145
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:03,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, then maybe it is two rows.

1146
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:04,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was just one.

1147
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:07,215
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's only one theater that they have it in.

1148
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:08,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Very limited.

1149
01:24:09,597 --> 01:24:09,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun.

1150
01:24:10,117 --> 01:24:11,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of 30 theaters that has it.

1151
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:15,360
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's, of course, the seats that move, the little motion seats that, you know.

1152
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:17,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's fun.

1153
01:24:17,741 --> 01:24:19,861
[SPEAKER_05]: It's completely unnecessary for a lot of movies.

1154
01:24:20,062 --> 01:24:23,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the only movie I've seen in D-Box was the Resident Evil movie.

1155
01:24:23,643 --> 01:24:30,246
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I'm not a fan of the Resident Evil series and stuff, but that movie is so far away from the Resident Evil game series.

1156
01:24:30,306 --> 01:24:31,807
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of, like, The Matrix now.

1157
01:24:32,027 --> 01:24:32,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1158
01:24:33,087 --> 01:24:34,028
[SPEAKER_05]: It was still pretty cool.

1159
01:24:34,408 --> 01:24:39,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think with Tron, though, just even watching Tron the first time around, it's going to be awesome with the D-Box stuff.

1160
01:24:40,312 --> 01:24:41,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really looking forward to it.

1161
01:24:41,473 --> 01:24:42,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us know when you're going.

1162
01:24:42,913 --> 01:24:45,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I even think, though... Probably Wednesday during the day.

1163
01:24:45,415 --> 01:24:48,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I did the D-Box thing, but it was a little silly.

1164
01:24:48,897 --> 01:24:49,858
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a little silly.

1165
01:24:50,598 --> 01:24:51,919
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's cool to say you did it.

1166
01:24:51,939 --> 01:24:52,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Which movie did you do it for?

1167
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Tron.

1168
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:53,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you did?

1169
01:24:54,061 --> 01:24:54,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1170
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:55,542
[SPEAKER_08]: When's Hot Christmas Eve?

1171
01:24:55,862 --> 01:24:56,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, did you like it?

1172
01:24:57,223 --> 01:24:57,423
[SPEAKER_03]: It was...

1173
01:24:59,404 --> 01:25:03,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I really like Tron, yes, but it was a little unnecessary and it was kind of expensive.

1174
01:25:05,068 --> 01:25:08,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't expect to get just thrown around in the seats because that ain't happening.

1175
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:15,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can adjust the intensity of it, but I would compare it a little more to Captain EO where the movements in the seat are very subtle.

1176
01:25:15,476 --> 01:25:17,557
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of the flying stuff in there.

1177
01:25:17,577 --> 01:25:18,578
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that would be pretty cool.

1178
01:25:19,258 --> 01:25:20,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of it's kind of neat.

1179
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:21,640
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1180
01:25:44,594 --> 01:26:09,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I think yeah or that they have to make it like pitch pitch black in there which they can't you know that's what they do on things like star tours and stuff to kind of take you out of that but uh yeah you know they can't do that for emergency reasons and for people want to leave to go to the bathroom so uh yeah I think D-Box still has some tweaking that they need to do but it was you know what it was fun save up save up like the eight grand or whatever get a home unit

1181
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:14,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Defective Candy in our chatroom says So a D-Box is like Honey I Shrunk the Audience at Disney

1182
01:26:30,971 --> 01:26:32,592
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because those chairs don't move.

1183
01:26:32,612 --> 01:26:33,733
[SPEAKER_08]: The movie's a lot better, too.

1184
01:26:34,634 --> 01:26:36,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Honey, I Shrunk the Audience was terrible.

1185
01:26:36,235 --> 01:26:39,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, those seats don't move, though, in Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

1186
01:26:39,157 --> 01:26:39,577
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit.

1187
01:26:39,697 --> 01:26:41,218
[SPEAKER_08]: They do a little bit.

1188
01:26:41,318 --> 01:26:43,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And I liked that because Eric Idle was in it.

1189
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:47,823
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a part when the baby picks up the audience and does this thing.

1190
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:49,664
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta admit, that part was pretty cool.

1191
01:26:50,273 --> 01:26:51,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the movie itself was dopey.

1192
01:26:52,474 --> 01:26:53,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was.

1193
01:26:53,594 --> 01:26:55,095
[SPEAKER_08]: It really outstayed its welcome.

1194
01:26:55,135 --> 01:26:57,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, when was the last time they made a honey-eye blank the kids?

1195
01:26:57,756 --> 01:27:00,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I had to say because Eric Idle was in it.

1196
01:27:01,018 --> 01:27:03,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I am really sad that Rick Moranis is not getting more work.

1197
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:04,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

1198
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,280
[SPEAKER_05]: That was by his choice, I believe.

1199
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe he retired to raise his children.

1200
01:27:09,281 --> 01:27:10,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, then props to him.

1201
01:27:10,802 --> 01:27:12,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you make Strange Brew, you can retire.

1202
01:27:13,123 --> 01:27:14,483
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it is, I guess.

1203
01:27:15,283 --> 01:27:17,084
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1204
01:27:17,104 --> 01:27:18,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think his best movie was My Blue Heaven.

1205
01:27:19,844 --> 01:27:22,205
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura does a side podcast with her friends Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.

1206
01:27:47,858 --> 01:27:48,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Comic Insanity

1207
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:12,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1208
01:28:12,946 --> 01:28:14,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to listen to it.

1209
01:28:14,527 --> 01:28:17,068
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a loyal OLR listener, you have to listen to that too.

1210
01:28:17,868 --> 01:28:19,189
[SPEAKER_08]: And you should also listen to Horde House.

1211
01:28:19,589 --> 01:28:22,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if you don't play WoW, you can hear Extover make dick and fart jokes.

1212
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:27,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth, tapes on Thursdays typically.

1213
01:28:27,472 --> 01:28:30,513
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to be held to that, but usually if we don't do Thursday, we'll do Friday.

1214
01:28:31,093 --> 01:28:35,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So later in the week is when we do our show and we put it right up on iTunes so you folks can grab that.

1215
01:28:35,575 --> 01:28:36,755
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it's a fun show.

1216
01:28:36,775 --> 01:28:41,057
[SPEAKER_08]: We always have a third random guest and DarkSakura has made it known she wants to come on and be that guest.

1217
01:28:41,477 --> 01:28:43,077
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to work her into a future episode.

1218
01:28:43,437 --> 01:28:44,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, won't happen this week.

1219
01:28:45,058 --> 01:28:48,159
[SPEAKER_08]: We're having our gala 10th episode special this week.

1220
01:28:48,419 --> 01:28:48,979
[SPEAKER_08]: A look back.

1221
01:28:48,999 --> 01:28:49,659
[SPEAKER_08]: 10th anniversary?

1222
01:28:49,859 --> 01:28:53,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, a look back at 10 hilarious episodes of The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.

1223
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,220
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be a good time.

1224
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,501
[SPEAKER_08]: And very self-serving because that's what anniversary podcasts should be.

1225
01:28:57,741 --> 01:28:59,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're making a big, big deal for our team.

1226
01:28:59,401 --> 01:29:03,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm telling you, the 10th episode of Horde House is a much bigger deal than 400 episodes of OLR.

1227
01:29:03,682 --> 01:29:08,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm sorry, but that's just... It's a joke, DarkSakura.

1228
01:29:08,423 --> 01:29:08,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it?

1229
01:29:09,153 --> 01:29:36,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm eating Alright, let's get to some rapid fire news I can't make weird faces at you when I'm doing chipmunk cheeks We don't have a website by the way We're not on Infamous.net and we're not even on OrangeLaunchRadio.com We have a blog spot and really that's just the shell for the podcast feed Also We don't have a website right now Before we forget, Geek Life Go to geek-life.com, we're having a comic book giveaway So go in there and read about it

1230
01:29:37,625 --> 01:29:45,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, speaking of Geek Life, Maren Marvel, who runs that and who has filled in for me on this very program, she was on episode 8 of Horde House, not this week's, but last week's episode.

1231
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:46,842
[SPEAKER_08]: She did a phenomenal job.

1232
01:29:47,163 --> 01:29:49,086
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you haven't heard that episode of Horde House, you should go listen to it.

1233
01:29:49,507 --> 01:29:50,308
[SPEAKER_08]: She did a very good job.

1234
01:29:51,621 --> 01:30:02,565
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's go to some rapid-fire news, some of the news stories that we just didn't find the long amounts of time to talk about in other parts of the show, but we wanted to talk about them anyway.

1235
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:05,246
[SPEAKER_05]: APB reloaded.

1236
01:30:05,706 --> 01:30:06,927
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing a beta for it.

1237
01:30:07,007 --> 01:30:10,388
[SPEAKER_05]: How ironic, because I actually participated in the original APB beta.

1238
01:30:11,829 --> 01:30:16,194
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're interested in that, they're going to be starting the closed beta in February.

1239
01:30:16,695 --> 01:30:22,721
[SPEAKER_05]: The official Twitter account, APB Reloaded, has more information on that.

1240
01:30:23,422 --> 01:30:28,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, you can sign up on the official website.

1241
01:30:32,285 --> 01:30:39,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, of course, going to be free to play when it finally launches, unlike the original APB.

1242
01:30:39,693 --> 01:30:41,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't think APB was that bad of a game.

1243
01:30:42,957 --> 01:30:47,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was actually pretty cool, but unfortunately it didn't last too long.

1244
01:30:47,982 --> 01:30:50,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely worth checking out, especially since it's going to be free to play.

1245
01:30:52,189 --> 01:30:55,432
[SPEAKER_05]: The PSP Go has been hacked, not surprisingly.

1246
01:30:56,913 --> 01:31:05,860
[SPEAKER_05]: The brand new, I guess, firmware 6.31 and 6.35 have a new homebrew enabler for them.

1247
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:18,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And using this homebrew enabler, you're actually able to load the Prometheus ISO loader, which for those who don't know, it loads dumps of different PSP games.

1248
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:36,535
[SPEAKER_05]: and, of course, the PSP game to show off your hack would be Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, the PSP game that does not have a digital version of it on the PlayStation Network store, pissing off people that own a PSP Go.

1249
01:31:37,355 --> 01:31:46,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, this homebrew enabler doesn't really require any sort of tricks to get it to work, so that's...

1250
01:31:46,718 --> 01:31:49,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Not good news for Sony, but I'm sure they'll try to find a way to patch that out.

1251
01:31:52,242 --> 01:32:00,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, there's a couple games in this series that have been available on the iOS store.

1252
01:32:02,269 --> 01:32:10,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the Japanese App Store, or if you have a jailbroken iPhone or iPod, you can also find these available as well.

1253
01:32:11,516 --> 01:32:15,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's a game dev story, and of course there's game dev story 2.

1254
01:32:16,264 --> 01:32:22,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Well now there's a brand new game that they have coming out called, uh, Why Why the Game Dealer.

1255
01:32:22,674 --> 01:32:24,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's basically, um...

1256
01:32:25,916 --> 01:32:52,149
[SPEAKER_05]: a game retail store sim and the game dealer you assume the role of a game store boss who must manage employees and please customers all while balancing the stock portfolio of game development studios and apparently also be able to offer customers food and shoo away mall rats from the free food mini games that's funny um

1257
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:58,349
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game Dealer is available on the Japanese App Store right now.

1258
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:01,151
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like fun.

1259
01:33:02,171 --> 01:33:04,753
[SPEAKER_08]: That's real life for a lot of people that listen to this show, I'm sure.

1260
01:33:05,113 --> 01:33:05,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1261
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:06,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1262
01:33:07,195 --> 01:33:11,377
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's go to Rock Band and what is coming out this week in Rock Band.

1263
01:33:11,397 --> 01:33:12,938
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still kicking along with new releases.

1264
01:33:13,539 --> 01:33:19,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Although this is a new release, I'm going to take a big fat pass on, but maybe some of you out there are into this.

1265
01:33:20,063 --> 01:33:23,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Linkin Park Pack comes out this week, January 11th.

1266
01:33:23,505 --> 01:33:25,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Crawling, In the End, Numb...

1267
01:33:26,107 --> 01:33:29,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Somewhere I Belong, Waiting for the End, and What I've Done.

1268
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:35,951
[SPEAKER_08]: All those songs are coming out for either 160 Microsoft points, 200 Wii points, or $1.99 on the PlayStation Store.

1269
01:33:36,431 --> 01:33:41,953
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also get some pro guitar or bass expansions for the song In the End and What I've Done.

1270
01:33:42,353 --> 01:33:44,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, if you like Linkin Park, that is.

1271
01:33:45,994 --> 01:33:54,139
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are a fan of Elder Scrolls and you're just sitting there tapping your fingers waiting for Skyrim to come out, well, maybe now is a good time to go back and visit Morrowind.

1272
01:33:54,499 --> 01:33:56,980
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a brand new mod that just came out called Morrowind 2011.

1273
01:33:58,581 --> 01:34:07,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Morrowind 2011 was a mod that was released last week, and it basically makes Morrowind just even more gorgeous than it was originally.

1274
01:34:07,226 --> 01:34:10,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember Morrowind, I mean, for the time it was awesome graphics, but

1275
01:34:10,928 --> 01:34:12,249
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1276
01:34:38,105 --> 01:34:45,448
[SPEAKER_08]: The author who originally made this whole expansion, he talked about it on his blog, which is at morowind2011.wordpress.com.

1277
01:34:46,008 --> 01:34:54,652
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, quote, In the end, I'm just very disappointed that I wasn't given a chance to correct the issues with the package, as I knew there were issues that were in the process of being fixed or updated.

1278
01:34:54,952 --> 01:34:58,974
[SPEAKER_08]: But the file is out on the internet, and it will be very hard for anyone to remove it from all the sites.

1279
01:35:00,835 --> 01:35:05,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, one other thing, and I'm very excited about this, the Facebook Civilization game.

1280
01:35:05,517 --> 01:35:07,318
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, I'm getting excited about a Facebook game.

1281
01:35:07,338 --> 01:35:08,239
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you going to do about it?

1282
01:35:08,259 --> 01:35:12,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Civilization World starts its alpha testing phase on January 12th.

1283
01:35:12,561 --> 01:35:20,085
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go sign up for it now, but it was a little weird because I guess you need to have a team name and all this other stuff.

1284
01:35:20,345 --> 01:35:21,565
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1285
01:35:45,484 --> 01:35:50,826
[SPEAKER_04]: More stuff, and some weird stuff among it, but including this weird-ass mustache.

1286
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:52,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll get into that.

1287
01:35:53,207 --> 01:36:01,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 is coming out, along with an extra mustache on the dude, and jumping!

1288
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:05,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be on PlayStation Network on Tuesday, February 1st.

1289
01:36:05,392 --> 01:36:05,632
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be $15.

1290
01:36:06,012 --> 01:36:10,233
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next day it will be on Xbox Live Arcade for 1,200 Microsoft points.

1291
01:36:12,815 --> 01:36:16,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Challenge Rooms, and Mustache Sailor Moon

1292
01:36:29,364 --> 01:36:34,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Sailor Moon is having a new DS game come out in Italy.

1293
01:36:36,288 --> 01:36:39,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Namco Bandai Europe is bringing the first Sailor Moon DS game.

1294
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:45,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the second Sailor Moon game that's being released outside of Japan.

1295
01:36:46,033 --> 01:36:52,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's called La Luna Splenda, which, yeah, very Sailor Mooney.

1296
01:36:53,917 --> 01:37:05,066
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're saying it's adventure, fantasy, fun, action these are the watchwords for next spring yeah the last Sailor Moon game that I had was on the Super Nintendo

1297
01:37:06,668 --> 01:37:12,270
[SPEAKER_04]: and trailers for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 reveal two more characters.

1298
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:16,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them, I saw coming.

1299
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:17,351
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one, I'm like, why?

1300
01:37:18,211 --> 01:37:19,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it is cool.

1301
01:37:19,272 --> 01:37:20,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely cool.

1302
01:37:20,872 --> 01:37:27,914
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one we get is Hagar from Final Fight and Saturday Night Slam Masters.

1303
01:37:28,714 --> 01:37:29,814
[SPEAKER_08]: That game was so awesome.

1304
01:37:30,095 --> 01:37:31,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish we could get that on the Xbox Live Arcade.

1305
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:33,561
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1306
01:37:58,118 --> 01:37:59,919
[SPEAKER_08]: This game is out, what, next month, is it?

1307
01:38:00,039 --> 01:38:00,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember.

1308
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,860
[SPEAKER_08]: I get my release dates all mixed up.

1309
01:38:03,001 --> 01:38:03,761
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be exciting.

1310
01:38:03,781 --> 01:38:04,381
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

1311
01:38:04,841 --> 01:38:05,202
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1312
01:38:05,942 --> 01:38:07,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, is that it for the Rapid Fire News?

1313
01:38:07,603 --> 01:38:07,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Yarp.

1314
01:38:07,943 --> 01:38:11,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we will get into the Twitter topics for tonight.

1315
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:18,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go to the tweeters, twitter.com slash OLR, where you show us your tweets every Sunday night here on this program.

1316
01:38:20,157 --> 01:38:21,338
[SPEAKER_08]: www.streetfighter.com

1317
01:38:35,815 --> 01:38:43,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they have actually kind of used the editor mode to make like Ken and Vega and Blanca, Dhalsim.

1318
01:38:44,541 --> 01:38:46,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody having fun with the editor mode there.

1319
01:38:46,662 --> 01:38:47,383
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of cute.

1320
01:38:48,163 --> 01:38:50,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how you can get the interview with M. Bison and everything.

1321
01:38:50,685 --> 01:38:51,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of funny.

1322
01:38:52,906 --> 01:38:54,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we were talking about that on the show earlier.

1323
01:38:54,888 --> 01:38:55,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, were you?

1324
01:38:55,428 --> 01:38:55,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1325
01:38:55,948 --> 01:38:56,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, awesome.

1326
01:38:56,929 --> 01:38:58,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's very well done.

1327
01:38:58,310 --> 01:39:01,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And the moves are pretty much what you'd expect out of them.

1328
01:39:02,625 --> 01:39:06,047
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't really play a lot of these wrestling games, but that's pretty cool.

1329
01:39:06,067 --> 01:39:06,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Dudley.

1330
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:07,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1331
01:39:07,949 --> 01:39:08,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this, too.

1332
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:10,551
[SPEAKER_08]: In the side, like, what's recommended.

1333
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:12,692
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like there's a Felicia in one of these.

1334
01:39:12,732 --> 01:39:13,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, somebody did that.

1335
01:39:13,933 --> 01:39:14,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1336
01:39:15,934 --> 01:39:17,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Big boobies on Felicia.

1337
01:39:18,016 --> 01:39:18,556
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyway.

1338
01:39:19,477 --> 01:39:19,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

1339
01:39:20,618 --> 01:39:22,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to SSJ100Matt on Twitter.

1340
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:24,820
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya

1341
01:39:52,358 --> 01:39:52,759
[SPEAKER_08]: to Milpitas.

1342
01:39:52,859 --> 01:39:52,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye!

1343
01:40:04,346 --> 01:40:04,946
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1344
01:40:22,777 --> 01:40:30,244
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw says Ion and Atari is teaming up for the iCade, a classic arcade machine set up for your iPad.

1345
01:40:30,645 --> 01:40:31,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's adorable.

1346
01:40:31,606 --> 01:40:41,495
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this cute little machine with tangible joystick and buttons that you can put your iPad in and, like, play old games with.

1347
01:40:41,775 --> 01:40:42,436
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.

1348
01:40:43,056 --> 01:40:43,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

1349
01:40:43,697 --> 01:40:45,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Except the fact that you can buy a...

1350
01:40:46,039 --> 01:41:03,022
[SPEAKER_08]: you know I know it's a really expensive way of playing something that you can get a million other ways but it's still cute I say it was cute and one more tweet for us from Tiger Claw Microsoft confirms that Kinect PC support is coming

1351
01:41:05,049 --> 01:41:05,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, good.

1352
01:41:06,391 --> 01:41:11,396
[SPEAKER_08]: As it should be, because if the modding community is so far ahead of them, it's almost a little bit embarrassing.

1353
01:41:11,416 --> 01:41:12,057
[SPEAKER_05]: It is coming.

1354
01:41:12,117 --> 01:41:13,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It already is here, basically.

1355
01:41:13,518 --> 01:41:17,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my official Kinect PC support is coming.

1356
01:41:17,743 --> 01:41:22,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Steve Ballmer hinted at this support in his keynote speech there.

1357
01:41:22,548 --> 01:41:24,230
[SPEAKER_08]: It is part of the company's larger plan.

1358
01:41:24,270 --> 01:41:24,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote,

1359
01:41:25,131 --> 01:41:28,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we certainly started out on Xbox and we're very focused in on gaming.

1360
01:41:28,973 --> 01:41:32,395
[SPEAKER_08]: We're the number one game console in a lot of countries and we're very happy about that.

1361
01:41:32,835 --> 01:41:35,956
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to do two major things, though.

1362
01:41:36,196 --> 01:41:42,079
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to move beyond gaming to include the world of socialization, movies, TV, and music.

1363
01:41:42,459 --> 01:41:47,542
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're trying to make the whole experience accessible to everybody in the family, not just the traditional gamer.

1364
01:41:48,002 --> 01:41:54,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So just expect this whole Kinect craze to grow, at least if Microsoft's keynote is to be taken at face value.

1365
01:41:54,585 --> 01:41:54,905
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1366
01:42:24,206 --> 01:42:28,749
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is kind of interesting and not too different than what they were doing.

1367
01:42:28,769 --> 01:42:32,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's an improvement maybe.

1368
01:42:32,892 --> 01:42:37,175
[SPEAKER_05]: But THQ for Homefronts, they're doing the online pass thing again.

1369
01:42:37,615 --> 01:42:46,161
[SPEAKER_05]: But this time instead of just saying, hey, you know what, you better buy the game new or pay the $10 and have no online play.

1370
01:42:46,521 --> 01:42:50,223
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying, hey, you know what, you better buy the game new or pay $10 or have,

1371
01:42:53,815 --> 01:42:55,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1372
01:43:23,334 --> 01:43:23,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1373
01:43:24,175 --> 01:43:30,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still kind of a crappy way of doing things, but it's slightly better than not offering any online component at all.

1374
01:43:30,761 --> 01:43:33,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you get a demo of the online component.

1375
01:43:33,744 --> 01:43:35,606
[SPEAKER_08]: That's basically what this boils down to.

1376
01:43:35,666 --> 01:43:36,587
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of weird.

1377
01:43:40,711 --> 01:43:42,933
[SPEAKER_05]: That's them combating the use sales.

1378
01:43:43,113 --> 01:43:46,777
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, I don't know if this is a game I'm particularly interested in, so we'll see.

1379
01:43:48,126 --> 01:43:48,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1380
01:43:48,627 --> 01:43:48,987
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked cool.

1381
01:44:08,169 --> 01:44:36,517
[SPEAKER_08]: But some of the early leaders were Flight Control HD and Chopper 2 That's right, some of the same crap that you see on the iPhone and iPad Is also dominating the Mac App Store Now if you don't know what the Mac App Store is It's basically Imagine Steam and Apple kind of combined It's selling, I don't want to say PC games But Mac games, like for your actual Mac In the same vein that you buy iPad and iPod stuff right now I think it's a great idea

1382
01:44:37,287 --> 01:44:40,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's a very logical and idea that makes sense.

1383
01:44:40,409 --> 01:44:43,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially because, you know, a lot of these games are kind of cheaper this way.

1384
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Like games like Chopper 2, 99 cents.

1385
01:44:46,954 --> 01:44:48,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Angry Birds, five bucks.

1386
01:44:49,696 --> 01:44:54,840
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, that's much cheaper than going into an actual store and paying 20 or even 40 bucks for one of these.

1387
01:44:55,621 --> 01:44:57,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, not everything is so cheap.

1388
01:44:57,482 --> 01:45:01,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, some programs like iMovie is 15 bucks.

1389
01:45:01,225 --> 01:45:02,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Aperture, 80 bucks.

1390
01:45:03,206 --> 01:45:05,728
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, but it's a way for them to sell, you know.

1391
01:45:07,239 --> 01:45:31,493
[SPEAKER_08]: so uh interesting uh but what also is notable about this hackers you know the old saying hackers gonna hack so actually i just made up that saying so now we have haters gonna hate and hackers gonna hack well hackers gonna hack and they uh found the loophole in the mac app store they pirated angry birds already it took less than just a couple of days uh yep that's it

1392
01:45:33,041 --> 01:45:39,745
[SPEAKER_08]: All you have to do is copy and paste this in-store purchase code and you can get the games for free.

1393
01:45:40,265 --> 01:45:41,205
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, I love this.

1394
01:45:41,265 --> 01:45:44,287
[SPEAKER_08]: The name of the group that hacked the games, Hackulous.

1395
01:45:45,127 --> 01:45:45,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it?

1396
01:45:45,407 --> 01:45:46,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, tapulous?

1397
01:45:46,288 --> 01:45:55,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Hackulous, actually, they're responsible for the program Instalus, which is what people use to download pirated games on the iPod.

1398
01:45:57,436 --> 01:45:57,817
[SPEAKER_08]: and iPad.

1399
01:45:57,897 --> 01:46:01,484
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep thinking of Tapulous who makes Tap Tap Revenge.

1400
01:46:03,167 --> 01:46:03,708
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be fun.

1401
01:46:04,229 --> 01:46:07,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on with some more stories.

1402
01:46:07,675 --> 01:46:08,176
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

1403
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:15,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster Hunter 3 event go on because the town itself was similar to the one used in the game.

1404
01:46:40,009 --> 01:46:58,860
[SPEAKER_04]: and they had a lot of people go up including people who said that they probably would have never gone had you know they're not been the Monster Hunter event and I've got a couple of friends that live overseas who were totally in the Monster Hunter and like will go to the special Capcom events and camp out outside their offices and stuff so pretty crazy stuff

1405
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:04,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami did something similar for Love Plus at the Atami Onsen.

1406
01:47:05,345 --> 01:47:07,407
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did the same thing.

1407
01:47:07,668 --> 01:47:11,751
[SPEAKER_04]: And one was done at... Let me see if I can pronounce this right.

1408
01:47:12,332 --> 01:47:20,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Shakunage no Mori Botanical Park in Mimata.

1409
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:22,621
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did something too.

1410
01:47:23,162 --> 01:47:25,184
[SPEAKER_04]: That was for Colony Nasekatsu Plus.

1411
01:47:27,992 --> 01:47:28,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1412
01:47:43,374 --> 01:47:45,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we get like Angry Birds the ride?

1413
01:47:45,557 --> 01:47:55,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you imagine if you could go on like a Mario Brothers roller coaster where like as you're going up, like imagine, can you know that part of California Screamin' where it goes up, down, up, down, up, down?

1414
01:47:55,448 --> 01:47:56,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That my favorite part?

1415
01:47:56,389 --> 01:47:57,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, a bunch of hills really fast.

1416
01:47:57,791 --> 01:48:02,536
[SPEAKER_08]: What should happen is at the top of every hill on the Mario coaster, ba-ding, ba-ding, ba-ding.

1417
01:48:02,556 --> 01:48:03,197
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

1418
01:48:04,258 --> 01:48:06,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me they could not make an awesome theme park out of a video game.

1419
01:48:06,959 --> 01:48:07,439
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do it.

1420
01:48:07,559 --> 01:48:10,220
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess it would be all the licensing and so forth.

1421
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:11,300
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a pain in the ass.

1422
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:13,160
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, make it happen.

1423
01:48:14,301 --> 01:48:15,641
[SPEAKER_04]: They made a game in a theme park.

1424
01:48:16,421 --> 01:48:17,482
[SPEAKER_04]: The Toy Story game.

1425
01:48:17,822 --> 01:48:18,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's true.

1426
01:48:18,522 --> 01:48:19,082
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.

1427
01:48:19,322 --> 01:48:20,462
[SPEAKER_08]: That Toy Story game is awesome.

1428
01:48:20,482 --> 01:48:26,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are actually able to update it like an iPhone game or something with new levels and things like that.

1429
01:48:26,544 --> 01:48:30,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't ridden it since Toy Story 3 came out, but I heard there's some newer stuff in there.

1430
01:48:30,669 --> 01:48:31,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was really fun.

1431
01:48:31,629 --> 01:48:32,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep surprises going.

1432
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:33,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the game came out.

1433
01:48:34,971 --> 01:48:40,733
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we could totally have a mall taken over by zombies.

1434
01:48:42,374 --> 01:48:43,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a Dead Rising ride?

1435
01:48:43,974 --> 01:48:44,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1436
01:48:45,255 --> 01:48:45,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps.

1437
01:48:46,656 --> 01:48:47,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

1438
01:48:49,697 --> 01:48:51,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what would you want to see at a video game theme park?

1439
01:48:54,619 --> 01:48:54,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1440
01:48:57,045 --> 01:48:57,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1441
01:48:58,205 --> 01:49:01,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't think it's really a good idea, actually.

1442
01:49:03,166 --> 01:49:04,246
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't think it's a good idea?

1443
01:49:04,326 --> 01:49:05,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not, hater?

1444
01:49:05,667 --> 01:49:11,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it'd be fun to see, like, giant rabbit, you know, people dressed up as the giant rabbits or whatever.

1445
01:49:11,468 --> 01:49:12,148
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be kind of funny.

1446
01:49:14,108 --> 01:49:16,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Or just imagine booth babes everywhere.

1447
01:49:18,709 --> 01:49:21,370
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're suggesting a Hooters theme park.

1448
01:49:23,513 --> 01:49:25,094
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a Hooters hotel, why not?

1449
01:49:25,134 --> 01:49:25,495
[SPEAKER_05]: They do.

1450
01:49:26,275 --> 01:49:28,317
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the ugliest looking hotel I've ever seen.

1451
01:49:28,777 --> 01:49:34,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine one of those station wagons with the wood grain paneling on the outside turned into a hotel?

1452
01:49:34,982 --> 01:49:36,664
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be the Hooters hotel.

1453
01:49:37,244 --> 01:49:40,187
[SPEAKER_05]: They have wood grain paneling on the outside of the hotel.

1454
01:49:41,748 --> 01:49:42,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1455
01:49:44,470 --> 01:49:45,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, why?

1456
01:49:45,971 --> 01:49:46,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're tacky.

1457
01:49:48,113 --> 01:49:50,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on to another story.

1458
01:49:50,575 --> 01:49:51,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what do you have for us?

1459
01:49:52,165 --> 01:49:55,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not getting a reply I'm not getting a reply

1460
01:50:09,002 --> 01:50:11,745
[SPEAKER_05]: The Elder Scrolls Game

1461
01:50:27,762 --> 01:50:30,224
[SPEAKER_05]: One is going to be the way that the game actually levels.

1462
01:50:30,564 --> 01:50:40,631
[SPEAKER_05]: The player's levels are now going to be more balanced because I guess actually in the game, much like Fallout 3 and that kind of stuff, as you level up, the enemies level up as well.

1463
01:50:40,691 --> 01:50:43,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in Oblivion, it got to the point where it was...

1464
01:50:44,273 --> 01:50:50,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty damn impossible to be able to go up against some of the enemies because they would just be leveling up with you.

1465
01:50:50,956 --> 01:50:54,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like roleplaying games where they level completely up with you.

1466
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:57,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I think at some point you have to be able to overpower them a little bit.

1467
01:50:57,939 --> 01:50:58,520
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit.

1468
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:03,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I do agree that it should be a difficulty setting if something like that.

1469
01:51:04,482 --> 01:51:10,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, it's going to scale to the player's level, but it's going to be more balanced, they're saying.

1470
01:51:11,087 --> 01:51:22,394
[SPEAKER_05]: It says foes will likely be easily bested by using some of the new features in the game, like dual wielding, I guess is going to be a new feature that they're going to have.

1471
01:51:22,434 --> 01:51:28,158
[SPEAKER_05]: You can equip any item or spell to either hand using both simultaneously in combat.

1472
01:51:29,659 --> 01:51:31,721
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty cool.

1473
01:51:32,141 --> 01:51:33,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course,

1474
01:51:34,963 --> 01:51:46,150
[SPEAKER_05]: They were saying that, I guess, also the leveling system, they're saying no longer binds players to class defined by a set of skills.

1475
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:58,218
[SPEAKER_05]: It says players can pick and choose from the game's 18 abilities, which level up while using them simultaneously, unlocking perks with each new level.

1476
01:51:58,918 --> 01:52:00,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So it basically sounds like it's going to be Fallout.

1477
01:52:01,479 --> 01:52:10,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're also going to include new weapon crafting systems, improved character creation tools, etc.

1478
01:52:10,744 --> 01:52:16,527
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's pretty cool, character creation-wise, because I believe their tools are pretty impressive in Oblivion.

1479
01:52:16,567 --> 01:52:26,552
[SPEAKER_05]: The only problem I found with Oblivion, though, is I can create any character I want as long as they were butt-fucking-ugly, because that's all that that tool would create is really ugly-looking people.

1480
01:52:28,194 --> 01:52:30,676
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the Fallout one isn't much better, to be honest.

1481
01:52:30,716 --> 01:52:35,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how much you've played around in Fallout 3, but a lot of the characters are fugs there, too.

1482
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:37,741
[SPEAKER_08]: So, sorry to say.

1483
01:52:39,102 --> 01:52:42,164
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, SolarFlare reminds me in the chatroom, like FF8, Rob?

1484
01:52:42,525 --> 01:52:44,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly like that.

1485
01:52:47,844 --> 01:52:48,104
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1486
01:52:49,284 --> 01:52:51,765
[SPEAKER_08]: One more story for you guys, then we're going to get to Listless tonight.

1487
01:52:51,805 --> 01:52:52,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited.

1488
01:52:52,485 --> 01:52:53,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't even told you guys the topic.

1489
01:52:53,886 --> 01:52:55,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a fun topic tonight.

1490
01:52:55,186 --> 01:52:57,427
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you were paying attention earlier in the show, we dropped a hint.

1491
01:52:57,847 --> 01:52:58,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1492
01:52:58,107 --> 01:52:59,047
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe you figured it out.

1493
01:52:59,407 --> 01:53:02,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And I finally got a guest for us, and it's an exciting guest that we haven't had on the show in a while.

1494
01:53:03,008 --> 01:53:03,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1495
01:53:03,569 --> 01:53:05,129
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll get to that in a minute.

1496
01:53:05,809 --> 01:53:08,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go to this story about EA.

1497
01:53:08,590 --> 01:53:10,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Pulling the plug on some old games.

1498
01:53:10,572 --> 01:53:18,880
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, the servers are getting shut down for some old games because that fee you pay to use Xbox Live, well, it doesn't pay to keep old shit running.

1499
01:53:19,441 --> 01:53:25,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the good news is most of this stuff is old sports games, you know, games that have been replaced with newer versions.

1500
01:53:26,007 --> 01:53:29,891
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, NCAA Basketball 08 and 09, gone.

1501
01:53:30,311 --> 01:53:31,793
[SPEAKER_08]: NCAA Football 07, 08, 09 in 2010, gone.

1502
01:53:33,861 --> 01:53:34,662
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1503
01:53:48,561 --> 01:53:48,901
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1504
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:13,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Also closing on January 17th, the Sims Carnival.

1505
01:54:13,663 --> 01:54:21,107
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you were a Sims Carnival fan, but there must not have been that many of you because EA's shutting the server down, you will not be able to play anymore after January 17th.

1506
01:54:21,347 --> 01:54:23,828
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's this contingent out there going, there was a Sims Carnival?

1507
01:54:24,088 --> 01:54:24,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1508
01:54:25,741 --> 01:54:29,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, February 8th is when most of the sports games are scheduled to close.

1509
01:54:29,707 --> 01:54:31,589
[SPEAKER_08]: To be honest, this is nothing new.

1510
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:38,258
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always a bummer when it's games that aren't really sports games that upgrade every year, but it's kind of inevitable.

1511
01:54:39,019 --> 01:54:42,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, they feel like they can pull the plug because you're not playing them.

1512
01:54:43,044 --> 01:54:43,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Party Party

1513
01:55:12,734 --> 01:55:15,415
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for Listless tonight, boys and girls.

1514
01:55:15,535 --> 01:55:16,215
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited.

1515
01:55:16,255 --> 01:55:17,235
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't done one of these in a while.

1516
01:55:17,535 --> 01:55:22,236
[SPEAKER_08]: The way Listless works, we are going to be forming the definitive list.

1517
01:55:22,936 --> 01:55:25,397
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is no arguing once this list is complete.

1518
01:55:25,417 --> 01:55:27,217
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a very scientific method.

1519
01:55:27,577 --> 01:55:35,279
[SPEAKER_08]: And it involves you guys in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com We're going to bring in a fourth person to play along with us tonight.

1520
01:55:35,319 --> 01:55:36,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get him on the line.

1521
01:55:37,779 --> 01:55:40,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll dumb down the music here while we give our friend a call.

1522
01:55:42,847 --> 01:55:42,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello!

1523
01:55:43,007 --> 01:55:43,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi!

1524
01:55:43,167 --> 01:55:43,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi!

1525
01:55:43,268 --> 01:55:45,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this Breslow?! !

1526
01:55:57,893 --> 01:55:58,693
[SPEAKER_07]: It usually is.

1527
01:55:59,154 --> 01:56:00,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Lord, hang up, Rob.

1528
01:56:00,735 --> 01:56:02,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Long time no talk, my friend.

1529
01:56:02,275 --> 01:56:02,876
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

1530
01:56:02,976 --> 01:56:03,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

1531
01:56:03,756 --> 01:56:05,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy New Year, DarkSakura.

1532
01:56:05,397 --> 01:56:05,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Geez.

1533
01:56:06,597 --> 01:56:07,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

1534
01:56:07,278 --> 01:56:08,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard, hard, hard, hard.

1535
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:11,100
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your New Year's resolutions, Breslau?

1536
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:11,800
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

1537
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:12,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I've broken them all already.

1538
01:56:13,001 --> 01:56:16,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I did my first episode of USL, so those are all out the window.

1539
01:56:16,222 --> 01:56:17,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.

1540
01:56:17,843 --> 01:56:25,566
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't know Bress Lowell, not only has he guested on this show a little bit in the past, not so much lately though, sadly, but that's because he's too busy doing another show.

1541
01:56:25,666 --> 01:56:31,668
[SPEAKER_08]: He's big time now, a host on Under Sedation Live, which is Saturday nights on the All Games Network.

1542
01:56:32,248 --> 01:56:39,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And with Iguana Girl, who's been on this show as well, Jessica Harper, Travis Donovan, who I'm afraid to have on this show.

1543
01:56:39,671 --> 01:56:42,012
[SPEAKER_04]: But Rob's never been on Under Sedation Live, has he?

1544
01:56:42,072 --> 01:56:43,072
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I grew up.

1545
01:56:43,132 --> 01:56:44,513
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my old stomping grounds.

1546
01:56:45,177 --> 01:56:48,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, this is our 10th year doing it, and we didn't even realize it.

1547
01:56:48,418 --> 01:56:48,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1548
01:56:49,438 --> 01:56:52,679
[SPEAKER_08]: And here I was talking about OLR celebrating the 400th episode.

1549
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:55,080
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, USL's taking a lot of breaks.

1550
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:56,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know if they've gotten up to 400.

1551
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:57,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate to say it, DMN.

1552
01:56:58,001 --> 01:56:58,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1553
01:56:59,201 --> 01:56:59,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa, hey.

1554
01:57:00,061 --> 01:57:00,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Blast from the past there.

1555
01:57:01,042 --> 01:57:01,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry, Breslow.

1556
01:57:02,502 --> 01:57:04,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm looking at... Never mind, I don't want to say it.

1557
01:57:04,362 --> 01:57:06,123
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm looking at something, and it still says the old name.

1558
01:57:07,657 --> 01:57:10,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to have you on specifically to talk about USL madness

1559
01:57:18,496 --> 01:57:22,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we extended the deadline because not a lot of people submitted.

1560
01:57:23,598 --> 01:57:28,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically what you do is you get a list of your 25 most favorite video games of all time.

1561
01:57:29,259 --> 01:57:36,142
[SPEAKER_07]: They can be as far back as Atari 2600 and television, and they can be as modern as Xbox 360, PS3, PC.

1562
01:57:36,442 --> 01:57:38,162
[SPEAKER_07]: They can even be your favorite arcade games.

1563
01:57:38,202 --> 01:57:42,024
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually have had one nomination for Skee-Ball, believe it or not.

1564
01:57:42,224 --> 01:57:44,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, good choice actually.

1565
01:57:44,905 --> 01:57:45,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Skee-Ball is pretty awesome.

1566
01:57:46,499 --> 01:58:01,598
[SPEAKER_07]: but basically what you do is you get that list together order it from 1 to 25 1 being Super Metroid, 25 being Minecraft or something I like how you told everybody what to make their number ones your number one you're just going to put Super Metroid next to it because otherwise you're crazy

1567
01:58:03,464 --> 01:58:23,110
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you submit those to uslmadness at gmail.com voting actually we extended it a week it closes tonight at midnight pacific which is if you're listening live less than 4 hours from now alright procrastinators I expect the live listeners to get cracking do you accept like partial lists what if somebody's like I can't get to 25 but I've got 10 would you take that?

1568
01:58:24,110 --> 01:58:24,591
[SPEAKER_07]: LB to Action!

1569
01:58:24,611 --> 01:58:25,031
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

1570
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:43,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow!

1571
01:58:44,111 --> 01:58:49,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Minecraft's in the top 30, Pac-Man's in the top 30, Fallout might get a one seed this year.

1572
01:58:49,876 --> 01:58:51,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, that's how nuts it is.

1573
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:51,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1574
01:58:52,358 --> 01:58:55,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, DDRDollarBill's in the chatroom saying, fuck Minecraft.

1575
01:58:55,441 --> 01:58:59,744
[SPEAKER_08]: So, DDRDollarBill, that means you better get your list in so you can bump Minecraft down a little bit.

1576
01:59:00,545 --> 01:59:02,947
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we will announce the bracket sometime this coming week.

1577
01:59:03,708 --> 01:59:06,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, uslmadness at gmail.com.

1578
01:59:06,930 --> 01:59:08,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Metroid's a one seed, right?

1579
01:59:09,452 --> 01:59:09,793
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1580
01:59:09,813 --> 01:59:09,973
[SPEAKER_08]: What?!

1581
01:59:10,013 --> 01:59:10,093
[SPEAKER_08]: What?! !

1582
01:59:13,157 --> 01:59:13,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

1583
01:59:13,857 --> 01:59:15,338
[SPEAKER_08]: This whole contest is a sham.

1584
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:19,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Your listeners are insane.

1585
01:59:19,499 --> 01:59:20,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure which.

1586
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you ready to play listless with us tonight?

1587
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:23,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

1588
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:26,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have a list ready of something that I don't know anything about.

1589
01:59:27,102 --> 01:59:27,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1590
01:59:28,082 --> 01:59:30,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't tell you the topics in advance.

1591
01:59:30,523 --> 01:59:32,644
[SPEAKER_08]: That would never happen in the magic of radio.

1592
01:59:33,744 --> 01:59:35,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's tell the listeners already what the topic is.

1593
01:59:35,705 --> 01:59:44,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, if you were listening in Part A, I said pay attention when Loki did the story about THQ and Mattel are entering a game deal, which means we might get a Masters of the Universe video game.

1594
01:59:44,969 --> 01:59:46,470
[SPEAKER_08]: So we thought, you know what we should do?

1595
01:59:46,950 --> 01:59:51,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about toys that we think ought to be video games.

1596
01:59:51,592 --> 01:59:55,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, if we limited it to just Mattel, I don't know what's Mattel and what's not.

1597
01:59:55,413 --> 01:59:56,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Barbie's Mattel, right?

1598
01:59:56,614 --> 01:59:56,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1599
01:59:57,314 --> 01:59:58,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to just say toys in general.

1600
01:59:59,355 --> 02:00:08,140
[SPEAKER_08]: board games, whatever anything you can find in the toy aisle at Target or Walmart or Toys R Us I should say is fair game.

1601
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:09,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for like diapers.

1602
02:00:09,901 --> 02:00:11,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I don't think they should make a video game out of diapers.

1603
02:00:11,922 --> 02:00:13,883
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you guys have diapers on your list, please remove it.

1604
02:00:13,943 --> 02:00:16,325
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be an actual marketed toy item.

1605
02:00:16,345 --> 02:00:17,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it needs to be a toy.

1606
02:00:17,405 --> 02:00:19,106
[SPEAKER_08]: So babies R Us items don't count.

1607
02:00:19,166 --> 02:00:19,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright everybody?

1608
02:00:20,127 --> 02:00:22,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Now chat room here's what you guys need to do.

1609
02:00:22,348 --> 02:00:27,271
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to start suggesting things in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com because if one of the hosts

1610
02:00:27,851 --> 02:00:32,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Ends up duplicating something we usually turn to chat to figure out how to fill in the gaps there.

1611
02:00:34,053 --> 02:00:40,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the chat plays a very important part in this, because what's going to happen, we're going to go around and everybody's going to name their top three.

1612
02:00:40,635 --> 02:00:44,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and Breslow will each name their top three.

1613
02:00:44,517 --> 02:00:48,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Then each of us will go around and take one item off of the list.

1614
02:00:48,058 --> 02:00:49,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Something will not be worthy of the list.

1615
02:00:50,299 --> 02:00:56,021
[SPEAKER_08]: That will leave us with a list of eight, and you guys in our chatroom vote to come up with a definitive list of three.

1616
02:00:56,321 --> 02:00:59,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this sounds really complicated, you guys, but that's why it's a scientific process.

1617
02:01:00,302 --> 02:01:01,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Science is hard, y'all.

1618
02:01:04,109 --> 02:01:05,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful, guys.

1619
02:01:05,030 --> 02:01:06,270
[SPEAKER_07]: We're about to try science.

1620
02:01:08,151 --> 02:01:09,912
[SPEAKER_08]: She blinded me with science.

1621
02:01:09,992 --> 02:01:10,253
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1622
02:01:10,993 --> 02:01:12,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into the list.

1623
02:01:12,434 --> 02:01:13,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we start tonight?

1624
02:01:13,975 --> 02:01:14,775
[SPEAKER_08]: How about Loki?

1625
02:01:15,696 --> 02:01:18,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how often you start in list list, but tonight you're starting this list list.

1626
02:01:19,258 --> 02:01:21,919
[SPEAKER_05]: What toy ought to be a video game?

1627
02:01:22,159 --> 02:01:28,483
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a terrible, terrible answer, but I'm going to do it anyways because it's simple.

1628
02:01:28,943 --> 02:01:29,403
[SPEAKER_05]: It's simple.

1629
02:01:29,963 --> 02:01:30,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Ball.

1630
02:01:30,264 --> 02:01:30,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Ball.

1631
02:01:32,025 --> 02:01:32,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Ball.

1632
02:01:33,066 --> 02:01:33,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Ball!

1633
02:01:34,167 --> 02:01:38,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, tell us how the game Ball works.

1634
02:01:39,091 --> 02:01:40,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Really can be anything.

1635
02:01:40,252 --> 02:01:43,575
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, balls are very versatile toys.

1636
02:01:43,635 --> 02:01:45,836
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play whatever games you want with them.

1637
02:01:46,637 --> 02:01:46,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Ball.

1638
02:01:47,638 --> 02:01:49,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Press A to bounce.

1639
02:01:52,922 --> 02:01:55,745
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be like one of those reverse sandbox games or something.

1640
02:01:56,605 --> 02:01:58,247
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Minecraft, but with balls.

1641
02:02:02,258 --> 02:02:03,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see the commercial now.

1642
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:04,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Come, play with our balls.

1643
02:02:05,282 --> 02:02:07,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'll go next.

1644
02:02:07,224 --> 02:02:08,245
[SPEAKER_08]: My number three choice.

1645
02:02:08,366 --> 02:02:11,329
[SPEAKER_08]: My number three choice for toy they should make into a game.

1646
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:14,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven.

1647
02:02:15,094 --> 02:02:17,156
[SPEAKER_04]: That was on my list and I removed it, Rob.

1648
02:02:20,290 --> 02:02:22,891
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so, Cookie Mama... Wouldn't that be in the reverse, though?

1649
02:02:23,611 --> 02:02:24,011
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you mean?

1650
02:02:24,591 --> 02:02:29,793
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, like, kind of making a video game into a toy.

1651
02:02:30,853 --> 02:02:32,594
[SPEAKER_08]: The toy's already existed ever since I was a little girl.

1652
02:02:32,614 --> 02:02:34,415
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's video games based on a toy.

1653
02:02:34,435 --> 02:02:38,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Easy Bake Ovens have been around forever, and now Cookie Mama's gonna take that old toy... I understand.

1654
02:02:38,776 --> 02:02:42,737
[SPEAKER_08]: ...and she's gonna make fine cuisine with nothing but a light bulb.

1655
02:02:42,757 --> 02:02:44,498
[SPEAKER_07]: You press the eject button and food comes out.

1656
02:02:44,758 --> 02:02:46,699
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what is your number three answer?

1657
02:02:46,739 --> 02:02:48,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Toy that ought to be a game.

1658
02:03:10,427 --> 02:03:12,148
[SPEAKER_04]: The erector set level building game.

1659
02:03:13,089 --> 02:03:17,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to build the whole thing out of erector sets and then you run your little guy through the erector set.

1660
02:03:18,353 --> 02:03:18,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1661
02:03:19,434 --> 02:03:21,495
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like a Lego game but not because it's an erector set.

1662
02:03:21,515 --> 02:03:22,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a little big planet.

1663
02:03:23,036 --> 02:03:25,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Only you build the whole thing out of erectors.

1664
02:03:26,259 --> 02:03:26,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1665
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:26,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Erector sets.

1666
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:28,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, screw chat.

1667
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:31,102
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not giving the answers that come on the show.

1668
02:03:31,162 --> 02:03:32,083
[SPEAKER_08]: You are, Bressel.

1669
02:03:32,143 --> 02:03:33,124
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter if chat took them.

1670
02:03:33,944 --> 02:03:35,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my throwaway choice then.

1671
02:03:36,026 --> 02:03:36,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, fine.

1672
02:03:37,186 --> 02:03:37,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Homies.

1673
02:03:37,427 --> 02:03:37,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Homies.

1674
02:03:40,062 --> 02:03:40,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1675
02:03:40,723 --> 02:03:41,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Little Homies.

1676
02:03:41,404 --> 02:03:43,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Those little toys, the Homies.

1677
02:03:43,406 --> 02:03:44,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

1678
02:03:44,787 --> 02:03:45,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1679
02:03:45,147 --> 02:03:46,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen those in forever.

1680
02:03:46,569 --> 02:03:48,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you want to hear something ironic?

1681
02:03:48,430 --> 02:03:48,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

1682
02:03:48,691 --> 02:03:50,412
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a Little Homies game.

1683
02:03:50,452 --> 02:03:50,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there?

1684
02:03:51,013 --> 02:03:51,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there was.

1685
02:03:51,934 --> 02:03:52,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1686
02:03:52,274 --> 02:03:53,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they need to do a better one.

1687
02:03:54,156 --> 02:03:55,457
[SPEAKER_08]: What would the Homies game be?

1688
02:03:55,857 --> 02:03:56,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Brestle.

1689
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:58,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, Saints Row 3?

1690
02:03:59,041 --> 02:04:01,143
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a kart racing game, is what it was.

1691
02:04:01,463 --> 02:04:02,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1692
02:04:02,703 --> 02:04:03,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw that.

1693
02:04:03,344 --> 02:04:04,184
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to do it again.

1694
02:04:05,005 --> 02:04:05,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1695
02:04:06,446 --> 02:04:08,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I love some of the choices that are coming out in chat, by the way.

02:04:09,047 --> 02:04:12,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, number two pick, Loki, who brought us Ball.

[SPEAKER_08]: What is your number two pick for a toy they ought to make into a video game?

1698
02:04:16,432 --> 02:04:20,434
[SPEAKER_07]: If you say Top, I'm coming down to Sacramento and punching you.

[SPEAKER_08]: Because I can think of no better way to rave than with Light Bright.

1705
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:20,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Use your Light Bright to throw a sweet rave party.

1706
02:05:20,303 --> 02:05:21,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1707
02:05:21,905 --> 02:05:24,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Sandstorm is already a confirmed song in Light Bright DDR.

1708
02:05:24,948 --> 02:05:25,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so y'all know.

1709
02:05:28,806 --> 02:05:29,967
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be awesome and you know it.

1710
02:05:30,007 --> 02:05:34,429
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be rave and the kids would be getting high and playing their light bright DDR.

1711
02:05:34,849 --> 02:05:35,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1712
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:39,792
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what is your number two choice for toy they ought to make a video game?

1713
02:05:40,012 --> 02:05:40,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Bratz Doom.

1714
02:05:42,353 --> 02:05:45,775
[SPEAKER_04]: As in they're all the monsters and you have to go around shooting them with the BFG.

1715
02:05:47,896 --> 02:05:49,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Bratz in Doom.

1716
02:05:49,877 --> 02:05:50,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Bratz Doom.

1717
02:05:50,697 --> 02:05:51,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Bratz Doom.

1718
02:05:52,478 --> 02:05:53,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Shoot the Bratz, alright?

1719
02:05:53,819 --> 02:05:54,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

1720
02:05:56,245 --> 02:05:58,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Would the final level have Paula Abdul?

1721
02:05:58,046 --> 02:05:59,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Because she was involved with the movie.

1722
02:05:59,507 --> 02:06:01,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Or no wait, she got fired from the movie, I think.

1723
02:06:01,607 --> 02:06:04,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, you have to be a special kind of stupid to get fired from the Bratz movie.

1724
02:06:04,589 --> 02:06:05,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a special kind of high.

1725
02:06:08,971 --> 02:06:10,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Wall drugs.

1726
02:06:10,891 --> 02:06:11,171
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1727
02:06:12,172 --> 02:06:14,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what is... I'm sorry, not Loki.

1728
02:06:14,173 --> 02:06:14,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Breslul.

1729
02:06:15,673 --> 02:06:16,734
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are so the same.

1730
02:06:16,814 --> 02:06:17,714
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to tell you guys apart.

1731
02:06:18,194 --> 02:06:19,235
[SPEAKER_08]: One of you is sitting right here.

1732
02:06:19,315 --> 02:06:19,775
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1733
02:06:19,815 --> 02:06:24,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Breslul, what is your number two choice for a toy they need to make into a video game?

1734
02:06:25,037 --> 02:06:28,642
[SPEAKER_07]: I really hope one of you three have heard of this board game, but I'm gonna say Dominion.

1735
02:06:31,582 --> 02:06:32,263
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next time.

1736
02:06:59,894 --> 02:07:10,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set, Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, and Dominion.

1737
02:07:11,120 --> 02:07:13,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what is your number one pick?

1738
02:07:13,781 --> 02:07:18,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take your Bratz Doom and I'll raise you Dead Rising Mole Madness.

1739
02:07:20,324 --> 02:07:21,064
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

1740
02:07:21,504 --> 02:07:22,045
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

1741
02:07:22,785 --> 02:07:29,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only do you have to fight off zombies, but you also have to find good deals on clothing and other couture.

1742
02:07:31,308 --> 02:07:32,368
[SPEAKER_08]: I really should have put that.

1743
02:07:32,428 --> 02:07:33,969
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that dating game called?

1744
02:07:34,009 --> 02:07:36,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I really should have put that on my list and I didn't.

1745
02:07:36,990 --> 02:07:37,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl Talk?

1746
02:07:38,030 --> 02:07:38,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Girl Talk!

1747
02:07:40,746 --> 02:07:45,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, they have this really shitty looking game that I've seen at Target.

1748
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:48,413
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something about, like, it's called, like, Oops, That's the Truth.

1749
02:07:48,673 --> 02:07:49,774
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is this game called?

1750
02:07:50,214 --> 02:07:54,879
[SPEAKER_08]: It's some type of, like, weird party game that they're selling as an Xbox 360 game.

1751
02:07:55,259 --> 02:07:58,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, um... Somebody's had to have heard of this.

1752
02:07:58,482 --> 02:07:59,383
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I know what you're talking about.

1753
02:07:59,403 --> 02:08:00,804
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Truth or Lies?

1754
02:08:00,944 --> 02:08:01,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that game.

1755
02:08:02,822 --> 02:08:05,043
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's called Truth or Bargain Bin, actually.

1756
02:08:05,983 --> 02:08:07,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, very soon.

1757
02:08:07,503 --> 02:08:08,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, my number one pick.

1758
02:08:09,204 --> 02:08:12,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I picked a serious one, just like Bressol did for his last one.

1759
02:08:12,444 --> 02:08:16,886
[SPEAKER_08]: My serious number one answer, Millborn on Xbox Live Arcade.

1760
02:08:17,026 --> 02:08:18,866
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be pretty badass, too.

1761
02:08:19,186 --> 02:08:22,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Millborn is like the best French card game ever made.

1762
02:08:22,747 --> 02:08:26,148
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be the only French card game ever made, but damn it, it's awesome.

1763
02:08:29,971 --> 02:08:32,193
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole point of that game is to fuck your buddy.

1764
02:08:32,293 --> 02:08:33,375
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the whole point of the game.

1765
02:08:35,762 --> 02:08:37,102
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what's your number one answer?

1766
02:08:37,122 --> 02:08:38,363
[SPEAKER_07]: My Little Pony Deathmatch

1767
02:09:09,187 --> 02:09:11,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it should be... They bite and get rabies and stuff.

1768
02:09:12,970 --> 02:09:17,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it should be like Derby Owners Club, but with My Little Pony where you can whip the horses when they're bad.

1769
02:09:17,734 --> 02:09:20,176
[SPEAKER_04]: And whichever one is last gets shot.

1770
02:09:21,157 --> 02:09:23,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Michael Vick presents My Little Pony Deathmatch.

1771
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:27,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, how about we call it... Here's the name.

1772
02:09:28,163 --> 02:09:29,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Death Race My Little Pony.

1773
02:09:29,784 --> 02:09:33,447
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you pre-order now, we'll give you a year's supply of Elmer's glue.

1774
02:09:35,308 --> 02:09:35,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking that.

1775
02:09:37,556 --> 02:09:40,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Death Race, My Little Pony is DarkSakura's number one answer.

1776
02:09:40,898 --> 02:09:42,519
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, I'm noticing a trend here.

1777
02:09:42,579 --> 02:09:44,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you have some anger issues.

1778
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:46,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody's homicidal tonight.

1779
02:09:47,142 --> 02:09:49,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Breslow, what is your number one answer?

1780
02:09:50,564 --> 02:09:56,167
[SPEAKER_07]: This was mentioned in the chat, and this is basically Pong on crack in board game form, Crossfire.

1781
02:09:58,095 --> 02:09:59,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit, I remember the commercials for those.

1782
02:10:00,016 --> 02:10:02,397
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one where you have all those steel balls, right?

1783
02:10:02,537 --> 02:10:03,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1784
02:10:03,477 --> 02:10:06,298
[SPEAKER_08]: My mother would never buy me that when I was growing up.

1785
02:10:07,538 --> 02:10:08,999
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom wouldn't buy me that either.

1786
02:10:09,019 --> 02:10:10,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I love my mom.

1787
02:10:10,519 --> 02:10:13,280
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a pinball table that used that same thing called Hyperball.

1788
02:10:13,460 --> 02:10:13,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1789
02:10:14,321 --> 02:10:15,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Crossfire was awesome.

1790
02:10:15,521 --> 02:10:16,721
[SPEAKER_08]: All the little boys wanted one.

1791
02:10:17,322 --> 02:10:18,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably some of the girls, too.

1792
02:10:18,362 --> 02:10:19,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet DarkSakura wanted Crossfire, too.

1793
02:10:20,263 --> 02:10:21,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my mom wouldn't get it for me.

1794
02:10:21,723 --> 02:10:23,264
[SPEAKER_04]: But she got it for my brothers, go figure!

1795
02:10:24,344 --> 02:10:25,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Our parents were all mean.

1796
02:10:25,505 --> 02:10:26,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, did your parents buy you Crossfire?

1797
02:10:27,647 --> 02:10:29,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want it, but I got to play it and it was fun.

1798
02:10:30,929 --> 02:10:31,630
[SPEAKER_05]: One moment.

1799
02:10:32,030 --> 02:10:34,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Shoot a bunch of balls at this other thing with ball in the middle.

1800
02:10:35,312 --> 02:10:36,033
[SPEAKER_08]: You alright, Bressel?

1801
02:10:37,994 --> 02:10:41,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Bressel needed to put the show on hold for a minute so he could tend to some business.

1802
02:10:41,537 --> 02:10:42,658
[SPEAKER_08]: BRB, poopin'!

1803
02:10:44,179 --> 02:10:44,479
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1804
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:46,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's the list as it stands right now.

1805
02:10:47,200 --> 02:11:04,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Ball, Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dominion, Dead Rising Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade, Death Race My Little Pony, and Crossfire.

1806
02:11:04,548 --> 02:11:05,649
[SPEAKER_08]: This is hard.

1807
02:11:05,709 --> 02:11:07,409
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to eliminate some of these from the list.

1808
02:11:07,449 --> 02:11:08,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I can.

1809
02:11:08,710 --> 02:11:10,791
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, but we got... That's how it works.

1810
02:11:10,991 --> 02:11:13,873
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1811
02:11:14,013 --> 02:11:14,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Homies.

1812
02:11:14,893 --> 02:11:15,893
[SPEAKER_08]: It's already got a game in.

1813
02:11:16,054 --> 02:11:16,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crap.

1814
02:11:16,794 --> 02:11:17,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1815
02:11:17,714 --> 02:11:19,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Homies is gone.

1816
02:11:19,635 --> 02:11:20,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Brussels, back from his poop.

1817
02:11:21,016 --> 02:11:21,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back.

1818
02:11:21,976 --> 02:11:22,257
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1819
02:11:25,258 --> 02:11:25,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1820
02:11:25,578 --> 02:11:26,118
[SPEAKER_08]: My turn.

1821
02:11:26,238 --> 02:11:26,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is hard.

1822
02:11:26,999 --> 02:11:28,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to eliminate any of these.

1823
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:28,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I...

1824
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:32,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I hate to do this because I know the chatters probably love this one.

1825
02:11:32,863 --> 02:11:35,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to eliminate Ball because I just don't get it.

1826
02:11:36,525 --> 02:11:37,486
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the game?

1827
02:11:39,548 --> 02:11:41,529
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like a tech demo to me, so I'm sorry.

1828
02:11:41,609 --> 02:11:43,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Ball has been stricken from the list.

1829
02:11:43,591 --> 02:11:45,772
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1830
02:11:45,952 --> 02:11:47,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Only for lack of familiarity, Dominion.

1831
02:11:49,135 --> 02:11:52,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, poor Breslul got two of them yanked from the list.

1832
02:11:52,717 --> 02:11:57,019
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's okay, Breslul, because you're obviously not going to eliminate your own, so you get at least one on there.

1833
02:11:57,459 --> 02:12:00,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Breslul, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1834
02:12:00,961 --> 02:12:02,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to eliminate Crossfire.

1835
02:12:02,602 --> 02:12:04,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven.

1836
02:12:05,644 --> 02:12:08,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, why are you eliminating Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven?

1837
02:12:08,783 --> 02:12:38,143
[SPEAKER_08]: because if only on the guarantee that it'll like my Xbox will spit out delicious treats which I don't think that technology is quite there yet so not yet not until we get the holodeck and how it makes food and everything all right so here's the list that our chatters are going to vote on you're going to vote for your number one and number two pick and you're going to send them over private message to sky in the chat room please label your number one and your number two choices or I'm going to assume what you list first is number one and what you list second is number two so here is the

1838
02:12:39,384 --> 02:12:40,144
[SPEAKER_08]: You alright, Breslow?

1839
02:12:40,465 --> 02:12:41,045
[SPEAKER_08]: You need a minute?

1840
02:12:42,506 --> 02:12:44,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so here's the list as it stands right now.

1841
02:12:45,349 --> 02:12:57,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Erector Set Level Building Game, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dead Rising Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade, Death Race, My Little Pony, and Crossfire.

1842
02:12:58,201 --> 02:13:04,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Chatters, it's now in your hands to come up with a definitive list of the top three toys that need to be video games.

1843
02:13:04,747 --> 02:13:09,748
[SPEAKER_04]: And while you're at it, Breslau, repeat the March Madness, the USL Madness email.

1844
02:13:10,728 --> 02:13:11,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I will do that.

1845
02:13:11,268 --> 02:13:14,069
[SPEAKER_07]: It is uslmadness at gmail.com.

1846
02:13:15,089 --> 02:13:20,030
[SPEAKER_07]: You have about three and a half hours to get those submissions in.

1847
02:13:20,090 --> 02:13:22,171
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're listening on the podcast, I'm sorry.

1848
02:13:22,211 --> 02:13:28,832
[SPEAKER_07]: The expiration has gone past, but we will have voting up probably by the time you're listening to this.

1849
02:13:29,932 --> 02:13:33,253
[SPEAKER_08]: And I noticed that somebody in studio just sent you an email.

1850
02:13:33,618 --> 02:13:36,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I already did one before, but I did it again just to be safe.

1851
02:13:37,287 --> 02:13:41,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I got one from you, but I'm assuming that it now rhymes with Waklakura.

1852
02:13:44,065 --> 02:13:44,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1853
02:13:44,225 --> 02:13:45,366
[SPEAKER_08]: You might be right, actually.

1854
02:13:45,826 --> 02:13:46,107
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1855
02:13:46,167 --> 02:13:46,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1856
02:13:46,507 --> 02:13:47,107
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

1857
02:13:47,447 --> 02:13:50,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for playing our dumb little game tonight, Brestle.

1858
02:13:50,029 --> 02:13:50,890
[SPEAKER_08]: We really appreciate it.

1859
02:13:50,970 --> 02:13:54,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Best of luck with USL Madness and everything that goes on at Understation Live.

1860
02:13:54,573 --> 02:13:55,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell the others we said hi.

1861
02:13:56,854 --> 02:14:00,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell Iguana Girl I'd like to go see another D-Box movie with her at some point and have Pinkberry.

1862
02:14:00,957 --> 02:14:01,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1863
02:14:01,477 --> 02:14:01,718
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1864
02:14:02,758 --> 02:14:03,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guys, one more thing.

1865
02:14:04,299 --> 02:14:04,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1866
02:14:05,020 --> 02:14:05,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he hung up.

1867
02:14:06,981 --> 02:14:07,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask.

1868
02:14:07,702 --> 02:14:08,262
[SPEAKER_08]: You ask.

1869
02:14:08,502 --> 02:14:10,324
[SPEAKER_08]: They have Ninja Legos now.

1870
02:14:10,864 --> 02:14:12,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Place your vote, by the way, right now.

1871
02:14:12,745 --> 02:14:14,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Send your number one and your number two choices.

1872
02:14:14,267 --> 02:14:17,449
[SPEAKER_08]: You have until the end of the mailbag segment to get those votes in.

1873
02:14:17,489 --> 02:14:18,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll tell you a spoiler.

1874
02:14:18,870 --> 02:14:20,511
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not a lot of emails tonight.

1875
02:14:20,591 --> 02:14:21,712
[SPEAKER_08]: So hurry, hurry, hurry.

1876
02:14:22,072 --> 02:14:23,753
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's see what is in the email bag.

1877
02:14:23,773 --> 02:14:25,915
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to open it up right now, folks.

1878
02:14:28,559 --> 02:14:32,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us your emails every week.

1879
02:14:32,401 --> 02:14:37,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura is going to jump in the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite emails for you all.

1880
02:14:37,985 --> 02:14:39,326
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the one email we got?

1881
02:14:39,566 --> 02:14:40,186
[SPEAKER_08]: One email?

1882
02:14:40,647 --> 02:14:41,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.

1883
02:14:41,067 --> 02:14:41,607
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big one though.

1884
02:14:41,827 --> 02:14:43,008
[SPEAKER_08]: You better get those votes in now.

1885
02:14:43,528 --> 02:14:45,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it actually is from Rababa.

1886
02:14:45,830 --> 02:14:51,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Picking apart an Ars Technica story about Nintendo warning about the 3D for young gamers.

1887
02:14:52,254 --> 02:14:53,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to read the email as is.

1888
02:14:54,655 --> 02:15:01,116
[SPEAKER_04]: First, they claim that eye growth as literally translated may be harmed according to a warning statement for the 3DS.

1889
02:15:01,497 --> 02:15:04,937
[SPEAKER_04]: They state that it isn't about actual growth, but rather perception.

1890
02:15:05,397 --> 02:15:10,719
[SPEAKER_04]: The concern is that the portions of our visual system that reside in the brain are adaptive.

1891
02:15:11,319 --> 02:15:16,900
[SPEAKER_04]: They adjust to information we receive and can remap connections in order to operate more efficiently on a typical input.

1892
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: This is especially true in infants as the visual system is still developing at the earliest stages of life.

1893
02:15:22,409 --> 02:15:42,043
[SPEAKER_04]: which is true, babies can't see much of anything for the first few weeks except blurs this ability to rewire our visual system on the fly is behind the 3D health concerns I actually don't know if what they state is true but it does seem made up to me I wish it said according to this article in the Lancet or the like

1894
02:15:42,663 --> 02:15:50,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it odd that they forget about the common eye disorder lazy eye where muscles in one eye don't grow causing a seemingly cross eye.

1895
02:15:51,026 --> 02:15:54,748
[SPEAKER_04]: This treatment is remarkably simple wearing an eye patch to exercise the weaker eye.

1896
02:15:55,488 --> 02:15:58,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I always assumed the warning was for conditions like lazy eye.

1897
02:15:58,710 --> 02:15:59,230
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

1898
02:15:59,950 --> 02:16:04,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, isn't the warning more about what we don't know about simulated 3D effects?

1899
02:16:05,055 --> 02:16:08,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that there will also be warnings to stop using 3D if you develop nausea or headache.

1900
02:16:09,239 --> 02:16:12,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, it must be better than the red-blue 3D.

1901
02:16:12,462 --> 02:16:13,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Later, rababa.

1902
02:16:14,424 --> 02:16:15,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Cyan magenta.

1903
02:16:17,199 --> 02:16:27,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we got into this a little bit last week on the show with the disclaimer, but I think it's just Nintendo kind of overcompensating a little bit where it's just that we live in a too happy society.

1904
02:16:28,529 --> 02:16:29,369
[SPEAKER_08]: They're covering their ass.

1905
02:16:29,770 --> 02:16:34,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I think a kid would have to play these games for a very long time.

1906
02:16:34,594 --> 02:16:38,437
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll admit, when I was playing the 3DS, I did feel that little pull on my eyes.

1907
02:16:38,957 --> 02:16:41,899
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, when it got to me, I just would turn the slider off.

1908
02:16:42,279 --> 02:16:46,861
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really about just kind of knowing your limits, I suppose, and knowing when to turn that off.

1909
02:16:47,262 --> 02:16:52,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I guess a child wouldn't really know their limits, but that's why parents have to supervise, you guys.

1910
02:16:55,066 --> 02:16:55,766
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

1911
02:16:56,026 --> 02:16:57,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what else to say on that.

1912
02:16:58,968 --> 02:17:00,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else for that email, DarkSakura?

1913
02:17:00,469 --> 02:17:01,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

1914
02:17:01,476 --> 02:17:02,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Death Race, Not Dead Rising

1915
02:17:22,777 --> 02:17:23,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead.

1916
02:17:23,317 --> 02:17:27,462
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the very, very last call.

1917
02:17:27,482 --> 02:17:32,067
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't get those votes in now, they may not count because we have to move into the FUs of the week.

1918
02:17:32,107 --> 02:17:34,189
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the part of the show where we get angsty.

1919
02:17:50,191 --> 02:17:58,238
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to my hip for hurting like a motherfucker all week and keeping me from doing fun things.

1920
02:17:58,358 --> 02:18:01,921
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I have leveled quite a bit in World of Warcraft and F you to that too.

1921
02:18:04,063 --> 02:18:04,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1922
02:18:05,925 --> 02:18:06,826
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to my shoulder.

1923
02:18:07,546 --> 02:18:14,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I must have slept on it weird or something last night because it's been hurting the hell out of me today, so that really sucks.

1924
02:18:15,013 --> 02:18:18,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure that your child hasn't learned how to climb out of the crib and come chew on your shoulder?

1925
02:18:19,233 --> 02:18:22,055
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he tried to eat my nose last night though, so it's possible.

1926
02:18:22,135 --> 02:18:23,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, babies are always sticking things in their mouths.

1927
02:18:23,657 --> 02:18:25,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you saw the picture on Facebook Nellie posted.

1928
02:18:26,279 --> 02:18:27,360
[SPEAKER_05]: That picture was great.

1929
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:30,783
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like some, he just like all of a sudden started attacking my nose.

1930
02:18:30,843 --> 02:18:31,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It was funny.

1931
02:18:31,983 --> 02:18:32,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something!

1932
02:18:33,044 --> 02:18:33,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Bite!

1933
02:18:35,286 --> 02:18:36,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Babies are cute.

1934
02:18:36,707 --> 02:18:39,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Until they get three and decide to jump on you and break your back.

1935
02:18:40,250 --> 02:18:41,171
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're still cute.

1936
02:18:42,711 --> 02:18:47,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the way that I hurt my hip is catching Becky's son Julian.

1937
02:18:48,715 --> 02:18:51,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Because now he's falling with style on top of people.

1938
02:18:52,337 --> 02:18:53,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in Toy Story.

1939
02:18:57,540 --> 02:19:02,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, my FU of the week goes to people that are always negative.

1940
02:19:02,823 --> 02:19:03,464
[SPEAKER_08]: All the time.

1941
02:19:03,524 --> 02:19:07,046
[SPEAKER_08]: People that just live in this negative little world with their negative little comments.

1942
02:19:07,406 --> 02:19:09,307
[SPEAKER_08]: They never have anything good to say.

1943
02:19:09,367 --> 02:19:10,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez, Rob, you're complaining a lot.

1944
02:19:12,483 --> 02:19:12,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up!

1945
02:19:14,044 --> 02:19:14,784
[SPEAKER_04]: That was negative too!

1946
02:19:14,804 --> 02:19:15,544
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I'm serious.

1947
02:19:15,965 --> 02:19:23,968
[SPEAKER_08]: I just say there's certain fun things that I like to do and the amount of negativity surrounding them is starting to suck the fun out of it.

1948
02:19:24,028 --> 02:19:25,468
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing any of you are involved with.

1949
02:19:25,488 --> 02:19:25,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry about it.

1950
02:19:27,089 --> 02:19:34,832
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of one of those things where I'm starting to get to my wits end and it's kind of like I might have to give it up because it's not fun anymore.

1951
02:19:34,852 --> 02:19:35,913
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a bummer.

1952
02:19:35,973 --> 02:19:37,474
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing to do with podcasting, y'all.

1953
02:19:37,494 --> 02:19:38,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't start rumors.

1954
02:19:38,494 --> 02:19:39,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Warcraft.

1955
02:19:39,734 --> 02:19:40,935
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just frustrating.

1956
02:19:42,716 --> 02:19:43,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, drama.

1957
02:19:45,241 --> 02:19:46,684
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always drama somewheres.

1958
02:19:48,128 --> 02:19:52,196
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's make things a little happier and get into the listless results!

1959
02:19:54,062 --> 02:19:55,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

1960
02:19:55,202 --> 02:19:56,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Results of tonight's list list.

1961
02:19:56,643 --> 02:19:57,163
[SPEAKER_08]: This is it.

1962
02:19:57,463 --> 02:19:59,103
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the definitive list, you guys.

1963
02:19:59,183 --> 02:20:00,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we got a late vote.

1964
02:20:02,144 --> 02:20:03,765
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost would not let this count.

1965
02:20:03,805 --> 02:20:06,365
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I don't think it's going to change the final result here.

1966
02:20:06,866 --> 02:20:07,386
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it does not.

1967
02:20:07,406 --> 02:20:07,726
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1968
02:20:08,786 --> 02:20:10,487
[SPEAKER_08]: The top three, and this is it, guys.

1969
02:20:10,507 --> 02:20:11,627
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no disputing.

1970
02:20:11,687 --> 02:20:15,048
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the three games you want to see them make out of toys.

1971
02:20:15,468 --> 02:20:17,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Number three tonight, and it was a close one.

1972
02:20:17,929 --> 02:20:22,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Number three tonight was Death Race, My Little Pony.

1973
02:20:22,130 --> 02:20:22,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

1974
02:20:23,430 --> 02:20:24,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

1975
02:20:24,330 --> 02:20:26,291
[SPEAKER_08]: We want those ponies to fight to the death.

1976
02:20:27,771 --> 02:20:31,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Your number two pick for game you most want to see them make out of an old toy.

1977
02:20:32,533 --> 02:20:33,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Crossfire.

1978
02:20:34,593 --> 02:20:35,413
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be interesting.

1979
02:20:35,453 --> 02:20:36,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how that would be a video game.

1980
02:20:36,394 --> 02:20:37,854
[SPEAKER_04]: You should find the commercial for Crossfire, Rob.

1981
02:20:37,874 --> 02:20:39,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't it have like a catchy little theme song to it?

1982
02:20:39,595 --> 02:20:40,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it did.

1983
02:20:40,395 --> 02:20:40,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

1984
02:20:40,675 --> 02:20:42,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I think somebody had posted it in chat.

1985
02:20:42,155 --> 02:20:43,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if I can YouTube it real quick.

1986
02:20:43,796 --> 02:20:44,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, hold on.

1987
02:20:44,676 --> 02:20:46,696
[SPEAKER_04]: The getty caught in the crossfire.

1988
02:20:46,716 --> 02:20:47,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

1989
02:20:48,917 --> 02:20:50,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It was retarded and funny at the same time.

1990
02:20:50,798 --> 02:20:53,359
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had this red and blue background.

1991
02:20:53,439 --> 02:20:53,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hold on.

1992
02:20:54,239 --> 02:20:54,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, kids.

1993
02:20:54,799 --> 02:20:55,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

1994
02:20:55,299 --> 02:20:56,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming soon to a video game store near you.

1995
02:21:24,141 --> 02:21:28,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I found one of those at a thrift store.

1996
02:21:28,625 --> 02:21:29,847
[SPEAKER_08]: God, the 80s were amazing.

1997
02:21:29,887 --> 02:21:31,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, with the label on it, Missing Balls.

1998
02:21:31,749 --> 02:21:35,112
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like a year ago.

1999
02:21:35,132 --> 02:21:37,094
[SPEAKER_08]: This game has no balls.

2000
02:21:37,735 --> 02:21:43,061
[SPEAKER_08]: And the number one toy you most want to see turn into a game.

2001
02:21:43,601 --> 02:21:44,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, you guys know our audience.

2002
02:21:44,903 --> 02:21:45,323
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?

2003
02:21:46,464 --> 02:22:05,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Light Bright DDR Yay, everyone get out the E in the sandstorm Everyone rave, coming soon Hugs, hugs everybody, hugs I made some candy because you're my friend you guys Let's hug, can we cuddle?

2004
02:22:07,011 --> 02:22:08,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the make out room

2005
02:22:09,309 --> 02:22:10,870
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's the cuddle room.

2006
02:22:11,610 --> 02:22:12,510
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the make-out room.

2007
02:22:12,590 --> 02:22:14,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know that's what it's going to turn into later.

2008
02:22:14,071 --> 02:22:16,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever go to... I want to say you went to one.

2009
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:18,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I just remember we both went to one or something.

2010
02:22:18,553 --> 02:22:20,634
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I went to a roller skate rave.

2011
02:22:23,049 --> 02:22:26,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Tracy Lords, I'm not even going to lie.

2012
02:22:48,212 --> 02:22:55,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, and Sunscreen and all of those mid-90s dance music.

2013
02:22:56,980 --> 02:23:03,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was activities going on in the outside because we couldn't do anything inside the rink.

2014
02:23:03,606 --> 02:23:05,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, we needed a soundtrack to this.

2015
02:23:06,889 --> 02:23:10,232
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had people in various states of intoxication on roller skates.

2016
02:23:11,553 --> 02:23:12,153
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing.

2017
02:23:12,373 --> 02:23:14,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, did you ever go to a rave when you were younger?

2018
02:23:16,023 --> 02:23:18,044
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I had to clean up a rave.

2019
02:23:18,424 --> 02:23:21,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not much fun.

2020
02:23:22,207 --> 02:23:29,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, they got the good idea to host a rave at the Cusar.

2021
02:23:29,972 --> 02:23:31,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

2022
02:23:31,954 --> 02:23:42,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And most people, I guess there was an orgy on the T-Mech machine, and there was also an orgy on the hard-driving machine, I think.

2023
02:23:43,742 --> 02:23:44,583
[SPEAKER_04]: The nap machine.

2024
02:23:45,203 --> 02:23:49,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so they had that, but people started... How can you have an orgy in the hard drive then?

2025
02:23:49,786 --> 02:23:50,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2026
02:23:50,206 --> 02:23:51,227
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't fit more than one person in there.

2027
02:23:51,247 --> 02:23:51,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't there.

2028
02:23:52,467 --> 02:23:56,150
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, people were paying money to go inside the arena.

2029
02:23:56,190 --> 02:23:58,451
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't even really playing laser tag.

2030
02:23:58,471 --> 02:24:01,173
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just staring at the colors from all the black lights.

2031
02:24:01,833 --> 02:24:04,435
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, yeah, I missed out on that, unfortunately.

2032
02:24:04,756 --> 02:24:07,298
[SPEAKER_05]: But I got to come in and clean it up afterwards, and that sucked.

2033
02:24:29,037 --> 02:24:57,989
[SPEAKER_08]: so uh yeah so that rave was kind of dopey but the other one was like an outdoor kind of thing I don't even know where it was because I wasn't watching where we were driving and I had a lot of fun I have to I'm not gonna lie I had a lot you know for being like the E for being 20 I didn't do any of that and actually everybody really respected my wishes um to not get into doing any of that but um I'm not gonna lie um there was this guy who I think might have had some of the substances it was really hot and we just made out all night like I didn't I didn't need nothing to get me in the mood

2034
02:24:59,490 --> 02:25:01,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, you're hot, that's drug enough for me.

2035
02:25:03,474 --> 02:25:03,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Rob.

2036
02:25:04,395 --> 02:25:05,035
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the day.

2037
02:25:05,076 --> 02:25:07,478
[SPEAKER_08]: And then actually, I kissed a girl at that same wave.

2038
02:25:08,279 --> 02:25:08,439
Ew!

2039
02:25:08,619 --> 02:25:12,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, because she's, okay, this has nothing to do with games, but I don't even care, this is funny.

2040
02:25:13,744 --> 02:25:19,771
[SPEAKER_08]: She took this book, or she had this book of everybody she'd ever made out with was in this book.

2041
02:25:20,547 --> 02:25:35,700
[SPEAKER_08]: and uh she was on page 67 and i said i want to be page 69 in your book like i i have to like this is my new goal i want to be page 69 in your book and she's like well i'll make out with you but i have to have 68 first so i was like you make out with her

2042
02:25:37,361 --> 02:26:03,191
[SPEAKER_08]: and so she made out with this random guy and then made out with me and then I was number 69 and then this is so terrible you guys don't do this at home then we decided we were all three gonna kiss and that's when I got introduced to three-way kissing which is really weird yeah it's it's there's certain things I can't say with my husband any other just kidding

2043
02:26:03,671 --> 02:26:06,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was my raving experience.

2044
02:26:07,876 --> 02:26:08,517
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good time.

2045
02:26:10,058 --> 02:26:12,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just done the roller rave.

2046
02:26:12,181 --> 02:26:13,402
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't sex.

2047
02:26:13,482 --> 02:26:14,924
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just kissing.

2048
02:26:14,944 --> 02:26:15,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done the roller rave.

2049
02:26:16,526 --> 02:26:17,447
[SPEAKER_04]: The roller rave was fun.

2050
02:26:17,927 --> 02:26:19,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I drank a lot of beer.

2051
02:26:20,410 --> 02:26:21,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can roller skate drunk.

2052
02:26:23,673 --> 02:26:24,213
[SPEAKER_08]: All righty.

2053
02:26:24,914 --> 02:26:25,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

2054
02:26:25,794 --> 02:26:27,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not drink and roller skate.

2055
02:26:28,655 --> 02:26:30,736
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a bigger disaster than drinking and driving.

2056
02:26:30,836 --> 02:26:33,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's try to get back into some actual video game news.

2057
02:26:34,717 --> 02:26:36,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless Loki wants to talk about three-way kissing.

2058
02:26:36,778 --> 02:26:37,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2059
02:26:37,558 --> 02:26:39,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no experience in that, I'm afraid.

2060
02:26:40,239 --> 02:26:42,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then I guess we'll have to go back to video game news.

2061
02:26:42,420 --> 02:26:44,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we're going to have to.

2062
02:26:46,141 --> 02:26:51,165
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was concern with Harmonix being sold by MTV.

2063
02:26:51,845 --> 02:26:52,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was going to buy them?

2064
02:26:53,686 --> 02:26:54,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it going to be Activision?

2065
02:26:54,827 --> 02:26:56,508
[SPEAKER_05]: God, let's hope it's not Activision.

2066
02:26:57,129 --> 02:27:02,052
[SPEAKER_05]: But ironically enough, no one ever thought Harmonix may buy Harmonix.

2067
02:27:02,393 --> 02:27:03,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what happened.

2068
02:27:04,494 --> 02:27:11,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently our Harmonix, they've been purchased and they have an investment group.

2069
02:27:11,882 --> 02:27:14,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Columbus Nova also took part in that.

2070
02:27:14,926 --> 02:27:19,591
[SPEAKER_05]: They purchased them for $49.99 plus whatever debt they had.

2071
02:27:19,811 --> 02:27:23,716
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently they're going to...

2072
02:27:26,981 --> 02:27:52,502
[SPEAKER_05]: take on their debts and stuff but Harmonix will assume responsibility over its liabilities and also includes music rights fees and responsibilities for lots of unsold games and equipment sitting on warehouse shelves also they're going to be able to keep the rights to Rock Band and Dent Central and will have control over those franchises so that's kind of cool

2073
02:27:53,931 --> 02:27:55,652
[SPEAKER_05]: and Viacom's not doing too bad out of it.

2074
02:27:55,752 --> 02:28:06,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the sale will reportedly net Viacom $150 million in tax benefits and considering it spent $175 million to buy the company in the first place, that's not bad.

2075
02:28:07,157 --> 02:28:12,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, so they're going to write off essentially on their taxes this year, Viacom.

2076
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:13,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Harmonix.

2077
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:14,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Viacom will write them off.

2078
02:28:15,801 --> 02:28:16,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

2079
02:28:17,262 --> 02:28:17,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy.

2080
02:28:19,013 --> 02:28:24,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope that they can get the backing that they'll need to keep up with production and licensing and everything.

2081
02:28:24,595 --> 02:28:30,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's the commercial on YouTube that's all QVC style where you can buy a video game publishing company for $49.99?

2082
02:28:32,970 --> 02:28:35,512
[SPEAKER_08]: and the chicks who have no idea what they're talking about trying to explain it.

2083
02:28:35,832 --> 02:28:38,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever watched them sell video games on QVC?

2084
02:28:39,154 --> 02:28:40,014
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes my brain hurt.

2085
02:28:40,255 --> 02:28:41,976
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so awesomely bad.

2086
02:28:41,996 --> 02:28:43,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't watch TV, Rob.

2087
02:28:43,437 --> 02:28:43,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.

2088
02:28:43,997 --> 02:28:45,017
[SPEAKER_08]: That should be a segment on our show.

2089
02:28:45,038 --> 02:28:45,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I just watch Supernatural.

2090
02:28:46,058 --> 02:28:47,659
[SPEAKER_08]: We're hard up for new segments on our show.

2091
02:28:47,699 --> 02:28:53,483
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to start doing like QVC selling video games because it's hilarious how bad they are.

2092
02:28:54,063 --> 02:29:01,568
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is called Shock Troopers and I think it's about getting electrocuted in the jungle while you're shooting guns.

2093
02:29:04,291 --> 02:29:06,392
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a really fun game for the whole family.

2094
02:29:07,613 --> 02:29:09,774
[SPEAKER_04]: And this game is called Resident Evil.

2095
02:29:09,834 --> 02:29:11,075
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not bloody at all.

2096
02:29:11,155 --> 02:29:12,076
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no zombies.

2097
02:29:12,596 --> 02:29:16,279
[SPEAKER_05]: For you auto aficionados out here, Grand Theft Auto is perfect for you.

2098
02:29:16,299 --> 02:29:17,679
[SPEAKER_05]: It has lots of cars in it.

2099
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:18,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And hookers.

2100
02:29:21,962 --> 02:29:22,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see really quick.

2101
02:29:22,903 --> 02:29:24,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they have any on YouTube?

2102
02:29:24,184 --> 02:29:24,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

2103
02:29:25,372 --> 02:29:27,274
[SPEAKER_04]: You know they've got everything on YouTube, Rob.

2104
02:29:27,294 --> 02:29:28,355
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to have a problem.

2105
02:29:29,596 --> 02:29:32,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, if you don't find anything, I will be surprised.

2106
02:29:33,159 --> 02:29:36,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was the guy who broke the TV with the Wiimote on QVC.

2107
02:29:37,362 --> 02:29:37,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

2108
02:29:37,802 --> 02:29:38,463
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty funny.

2109
02:29:42,146 --> 02:29:45,028
[SPEAKER_08]: QVC Phineas and Ferb motion video game.

2110
02:29:45,529 --> 02:29:46,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Phineas and Ferb is awesome!

2111
02:29:48,601 --> 02:29:51,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... This isn't actually a clip from QVC though.

2112
02:29:52,442 --> 02:29:52,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2113
02:29:53,103 --> 02:29:56,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, I don't... Chat room, you need to find me one so I can play it here on the show.

2114
02:29:56,764 --> 02:30:01,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we got one more story for you guys and then we're going to open up the 877 number.

2115
02:30:01,166 --> 02:30:05,347
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2116
02:30:05,727 --> 02:30:13,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, actually, I need to make sure that the 800 number is still working because it actually may have ran out tonight and I forgot to recharge it.

2117
02:30:13,710 --> 02:30:14,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Silent Hill Downpour

2118
02:30:28,812 --> 02:30:31,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, that's the new name of the game, Silent Hill Downpour.

2119
02:30:32,015 --> 02:30:34,717
[SPEAKER_08]: There's new information about this game in the latest Game Informer.

2120
02:30:35,077 --> 02:30:40,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the town is huge, and you're going to use a subway system to get from one part of the town to another.

2121
02:30:40,401 --> 02:30:43,964
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be a never-before-seen southeastern side of Silent Hill.

2122
02:30:44,445 --> 02:30:46,987
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no hospitals or schools in that area.

2123
02:30:47,787 --> 02:30:48,808
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're trying something new.

2124
02:30:49,508 --> 02:30:52,110
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be optional side quests apparently in the game as well.

2125
02:30:52,790 --> 02:30:55,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Combat will be from more like the earlier Silent Hill games.

2126
02:30:55,992 --> 02:30:59,934
[SPEAKER_08]: You can avoid a lot of encounters and it's advised to avoid encounters.

2127
02:31:00,314 --> 02:31:03,376
[SPEAKER_08]: You can only carry one melee weapon at a time, such as an axe.

2128
02:31:03,816 --> 02:31:05,197
[SPEAKER_08]: The enemies are very hard to kill.

2129
02:31:05,237 --> 02:31:06,478
[SPEAKER_08]: The weapons break easily.

2130
02:31:06,758 --> 02:31:09,840
[SPEAKER_08]: The only fights you have to do in the game are boss battles.

2131
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:37,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Water is going to be an essential part of the game There's apparently a room in the game that has upside down running water on the ceiling Puzzles will be back to scaling difficulty levels So you can have easy puzzles or super hard puzzles So that's kind of cool because it sounds like they're going back to their roots a little bit But it sounds like they're mixing a little bit of old Silent Hill with open world quest driven games Like, I don't know, Warcraft, Borderlands, that type of thing So that's kind of neat, I gotta say

2132
02:31:38,263 --> 02:31:40,025
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2133
02:31:57,944 --> 02:32:01,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft in our chatroom says Silent Hill Downhill more like it.

2134
02:32:02,648 --> 02:32:07,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like the last game except they're replacing the snow with lots of rain?

2135
02:32:09,515 --> 02:32:12,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to give it a try.

2136
02:32:12,317 --> 02:32:13,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to give it a chance.

2137
02:32:13,138 --> 02:32:14,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I've given the other ones a chance.

2138
02:32:14,099 --> 02:32:14,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to give this a chance.

2139
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, Silent Hill, you know.

2140
02:32:19,383 --> 02:32:23,167
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Dollar Bill says Silent Hill Signs Edition.

2141
02:32:25,033 --> 02:32:44,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like the idea of having the open universe so maybe me too maybe that will be the redeeming factor who knows what do you most want to see in a new Silent Hill game do you think they ought to just go back to Silent Hill 2 I want to see it produced by Konami in Japan that's what I most want to see

2142
02:32:46,605 --> 02:32:48,507
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it needs is to be back.

2143
02:32:48,707 --> 02:32:56,133
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to beg Yamaoka to come back and they need to just get it back done the way they were doing them before.

2144
02:32:56,173 --> 02:32:57,234
[SPEAKER_04]: They were doing them well.

2145
02:32:57,534 --> 02:32:58,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did they screw up?

2146
02:32:59,416 --> 02:33:01,578
[SPEAKER_04]: They shouldn't have ever sent the franchise to the U.S.

2147
02:33:02,258 --> 02:33:03,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean as far as to be developed in the U.S.

2148
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:04,900
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.

2149
02:33:05,401 --> 02:33:06,522
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have the same feel anymore.

2150
02:33:07,683 --> 02:33:07,983
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2151
02:33:09,126 --> 02:33:38,262
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to open up the Skype line right now Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR It does look like the number is working but the message I think is broken so if you call you're not going to get that little You've reached Orange Lounge Radio message line It's some generic thing right now so we'll look at that after the show why that's going on but otherwise you can give us a call right now 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Now there is a bit of delay between live and when the folks can actually start calling so I'll ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories

2152
02:33:38,564 --> 02:33:43,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there's some new stuff developing on the 3D side of the PlayStation Network.

2153
02:33:43,687 --> 02:33:48,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, they're going to start offering some 3D movies available on their service.

2154
02:33:49,451 --> 02:33:58,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of those 3D movies is, yes, the 3D swimsuit video via, I believe, Sports Illustrated.

2155
02:33:58,738 --> 02:34:02,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So you will be able to get 3D boobs on the PlayStation 3.

2156
02:34:03,221 --> 02:34:04,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Not quite porn, but hey, whatever.

2157
02:34:06,102 --> 02:34:07,724
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Cinemax-style porn.

2158
02:34:07,984 --> 02:34:08,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2159
02:34:09,952 --> 02:34:11,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've seen this yet, Rob.

2160
02:34:11,694 --> 02:34:13,536
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of scary.

2161
02:34:14,137 --> 02:34:15,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Another Kinect hack.

2162
02:34:15,879 --> 02:34:23,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Some guy has actually programmed the Kinect to allow him to play around with the figure of

2163
02:34:25,820 --> 02:34:28,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Ivy from Soul Calibur with boob physics.

2164
02:34:28,742 --> 02:34:37,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, lack of boob physics, but Soul Calibur boob physics, so he can move around with her boobs bouncing around.

2165
02:34:37,248 --> 02:34:38,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, boob simulations.

2166
02:34:38,769 --> 02:34:40,611
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we got a call coming in, so let's go to that real quick.

2167
02:34:40,631 --> 02:34:41,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2168
02:34:41,852 --> 02:34:42,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2169
02:34:43,273 --> 02:34:43,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, it's D.D.

2170
02:34:43,893 --> 02:34:44,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Odd Dollar Bill.

2171
02:34:44,614 --> 02:34:44,874
[SPEAKER_08]: D.D.

2172
02:34:44,954 --> 02:34:45,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Odd Dollar Bill.

2173
02:34:45,694 --> 02:34:46,615
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, my friend?

2174
02:34:47,696 --> 02:34:48,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing all right, man.

2175
02:34:48,697 --> 02:34:49,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing all right.

2176
02:34:49,397 --> 02:34:49,717
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2177
02:34:49,777 --> 02:34:50,278
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on your mind?

2178
02:34:51,784 --> 02:34:57,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, pretty much I was trying to send an email out to you guys, but I kept, I was trying to do it to the website, but I kept getting rejected.

2179
02:34:58,168 --> 02:35:00,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured, let me just call up and explain what's going on.

2180
02:35:00,710 --> 02:35:05,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Weird, I don't know why the website's rejecting, but you know, the website had some major issues last week.

2181
02:35:05,153 --> 02:35:07,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess some people started spamming our photo feed.

2182
02:35:07,794 --> 02:35:09,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed, I totally missed this.

2183
02:35:09,215 --> 02:35:11,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Actdeft and Deekman took care of it when I wasn't listening.

2184
02:35:11,817 --> 02:35:13,438
[SPEAKER_08]: But, uh, or watching, I should say.

2185
02:35:13,478 --> 02:35:17,401
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess, like, people were putting, like, weird, like, porno things in the picture feed.

2186
02:35:18,041 --> 02:35:18,501
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh...

2187
02:35:19,562 --> 02:35:22,325
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I've threatened to pull the plug before if that shit starts happening.

2188
02:35:22,385 --> 02:35:25,347
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I realize there's no one that actually listens to this show's fault.

2189
02:35:25,708 --> 02:35:27,029
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have to keep an eye on that now.

2190
02:35:27,189 --> 02:35:29,691
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of the things with the website might have got tweaked because of that.

2191
02:35:30,112 --> 02:35:30,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, what's on your mind?

2192
02:35:32,474 --> 02:35:37,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much this is probably going to be the year that I'm going to really just stop gaming.

2193
02:35:37,739 --> 02:35:38,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Video gaming.

2194
02:35:38,319 --> 02:35:38,499
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

2195
02:35:38,759 --> 02:35:39,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?

2196
02:35:40,680 --> 02:36:09,248
[SPEAKER_01]: well the other day a couple days ago I was going to I was just listening to some old Nintendo games like some music you know the NSF files the emulators and I was just going back like what are some of the best things I remember about games and quite honestly today's games don't have any excitement to it they just there's nothing really exciting about playing them anymore there's no games that get you excited anymore what type okay let me ask you this what type of old Nintendo games did you like

2197
02:36:10,926 --> 02:36:11,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Some memories, let's see.

2198
02:36:12,748 --> 02:36:16,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually love the original Ninja Gaiden, for example, the trilogy.

2199
02:36:17,171 --> 02:36:17,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2200
02:36:18,432 --> 02:36:19,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.

2201
02:36:19,974 --> 02:36:22,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Blaster Master was another popular one.

2202
02:36:23,116 --> 02:36:23,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

2203
02:36:23,537 --> 02:36:27,320
[SPEAKER_08]: That new Blaster Master game they made a little while ago wasn't nearly as good as the old one.

2204
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:28,280
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really unfortunate.

2205
02:36:28,961 --> 02:36:30,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Oof, I haven't tried that yet.

2206
02:36:31,103 --> 02:36:34,145
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, like, what was another one I tried?

2207
02:36:34,185 --> 02:36:37,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can go to Genesis games like Phantasy Star 2, for example.

2208
02:36:39,773 --> 02:36:42,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things gave me great memories.

2209
02:36:42,415 --> 02:36:47,538
[SPEAKER_01]: They made me want to play it through no matter how bullshit hard it got.

2210
02:36:47,578 --> 02:36:49,279
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just fantastic, those games.

2211
02:36:50,500 --> 02:36:54,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, no game really has actually grabbed my attention.

2212
02:36:55,203 --> 02:36:59,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just one, but how many games get released a year?

2213
02:37:00,146 --> 02:37:01,167
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bad number.

2214
02:37:01,267 --> 02:37:03,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of curiosity, what's the one game that grabbed your attention?

2215
02:37:04,289 --> 02:37:05,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Red Dead Redemption.

2216
02:37:05,623 --> 02:37:06,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

2217
02:37:06,203 --> 02:37:07,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was a pretty solid game.

2218
02:37:08,285 --> 02:37:08,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

2219
02:37:08,785 --> 02:37:09,205
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

2220
02:37:09,405 --> 02:37:17,190
[SPEAKER_08]: You seem to really like exploring in games because a lot of those games you name, they all have to do something like you explore and you find new things as you go through the world.

2221
02:37:17,550 --> 02:37:21,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially something like Red Dead Redemption is a lot about exploration.

2222
02:37:22,113 --> 02:37:24,674
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds like these kind of open world games might kind of be your thing.

2223
02:37:24,754 --> 02:37:25,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2224
02:37:25,074 --> 02:37:26,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kind of guessing.

2225
02:37:26,715 --> 02:37:27,536
[SPEAKER_08]: But what about like...

2226
02:37:27,956 --> 02:37:31,298
[SPEAKER_08]: New games that kind of call back that retro style.

2227
02:37:31,659 --> 02:37:35,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean things like Bionic Commando Rearmed, we talked about earlier in the show.

2228
02:37:35,201 --> 02:37:36,202
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a new release coming out.

2229
02:37:36,842 --> 02:37:39,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Meat Boy, awesome throwback to retro games.

2230
02:37:39,965 --> 02:37:40,545
[SPEAKER_08]: No interest there?

2231
02:37:41,686 --> 02:37:46,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, for Bionic Commando Rearmed, I loved that.

2232
02:37:46,990 --> 02:37:49,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I eventually beat it, and it was a satisfying experience.

2233
02:37:50,032 --> 02:37:50,852
[SPEAKER_01]: I really loved it.

2234
02:37:51,433 --> 02:37:54,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially since I loved Bionic Commando since the arcade edition.

2235
02:37:55,936 --> 02:37:57,816
[SPEAKER_01]: which most people are going to be like, there was an arcade?

2236
02:38:00,577 --> 02:38:02,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I seem to recall one, I do.

2237
02:38:02,957 --> 02:38:04,698
[SPEAKER_08]: And not even just the PayChoice10 one.

2238
02:38:04,738 --> 02:38:07,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there was actually like a, I seem to recall what you're talking about.

2239
02:38:08,518 --> 02:38:09,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like that one.

2240
02:38:10,519 --> 02:38:14,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Meat Boy is actually a very, very interesting case.

2241
02:38:15,880 --> 02:38:21,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried a demo of it and I liked it but at the same time my thoughts were

2242
02:38:22,503 --> 02:38:27,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I really want to go through the harder levels for reward that I'm not going to really enjoy?

2243
02:38:27,472 --> 02:38:33,122
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, it's like, am I going to play this difficult game for the sake of it being difficult?

2244
02:38:33,402 --> 02:38:35,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Or am I going to play it because I actually enjoy it?

2245
02:38:36,894 --> 02:38:41,056
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I see a comment in our chatroom, and I think this is a darn good piece of advice for you.

2246
02:38:41,276 --> 02:38:46,157
[SPEAKER_08]: And Azam in our chatroom says, Someone get this man a near-lethal dose of indie gaming stat.

2247
02:38:46,638 --> 02:38:52,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you're just fed up with what's in the mainstream and a lot of those games that, you know, cost $60 to find out a game sucks.

2248
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:55,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you thought about turning to the indie side of things a little bit?

2249
02:38:55,321 --> 02:38:58,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe exploring a little more what Steam or the Xbox Live Indie Arcades has?

2250
02:38:59,202 --> 02:38:59,403
[SPEAKER_08]: on it.

2251
02:38:59,683 --> 02:39:01,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, that's another good point you guys bring up.

2252
02:39:02,447 --> 02:39:11,719
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another point I was going to bring up because, yes, I've actually turned to indie gaming and I can tell you one other game that actually really caught my interest and I didn't really mention this and I got it remembering.

2253
02:39:12,981 --> 02:39:13,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Amnesia.

2254
02:39:13,481 --> 02:39:14,002
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever heard of it?

2255
02:39:14,202 --> 02:39:14,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have.

2256
02:39:15,123 --> 02:39:16,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I have heard of Amnesia.

2257
02:39:16,854 --> 02:39:17,855
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2258
02:39:32,869 --> 02:39:56,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean Super Meat Boy of sorts is an indie game as well there's a lot of these indie packs that are available on Steam I don't know you know it's not as cheap now as they were at Christmas time but things where you can get like you know kind of like a sampling of different types of games pretty cheap the humble indie bundle was out recently you know maybe there's more to look for in there where you don't feel like you're getting a shafted with the money you're spending

2259
02:39:57,686 --> 02:40:00,108
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when it's like you can't really play much demos these days.

2260
02:40:01,128 --> 02:40:01,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

2261
02:40:02,810 --> 02:40:07,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, DDR Dollar Bill, I hope you find something to kind of change your mind a little bit.

2262
02:40:07,713 --> 02:40:12,896
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so many types of games out there, but maybe it's just not going to be a AAA game from the developer.

2263
02:40:12,916 --> 02:40:22,943
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, you liked Red Dead Redemption, so I wouldn't look away completely from what the mainstream is doing because they'll be more like Red Dead soon, trust me.

2264
02:40:24,249 --> 02:40:27,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess it's just the start of the year, so I'll give it a chance.

2265
02:40:27,710 --> 02:40:28,170
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

2266
02:40:28,210 --> 02:40:29,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it'll be okay.

2267
02:40:29,390 --> 02:40:33,051
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, DDR Dollar Bureau, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks for giving us a call.

2268
02:40:33,431 --> 02:40:33,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Good topic.

2269
02:40:33,891 --> 02:40:34,571
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.

2270
02:40:34,611 --> 02:40:35,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, guys.

2271
02:40:35,351 --> 02:40:35,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

2272
02:40:36,491 --> 02:40:37,592
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, good call.

2273
02:40:37,612 --> 02:40:38,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to another one.

2274
02:40:38,312 --> 02:40:39,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2275
02:40:39,272 --> 02:40:39,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2276
02:40:40,752 --> 02:40:41,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up, guys?

2277
02:40:41,412 --> 02:40:42,112
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Taijudo.

2278
02:40:42,572 --> 02:40:43,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Taijudo.

2279
02:40:43,253 --> 02:40:43,913
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2280
02:40:45,313 --> 02:40:46,693
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

2281
02:40:46,733 --> 02:40:50,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I go into what I want to talk about, I just wanted to recommend...

2282
02:40:51,914 --> 02:40:52,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Game.

2283
02:40:52,354 --> 02:40:55,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not actually a game, but what you guys were doing earlier where you were combining toys with games.

2284
02:40:56,261 --> 02:40:57,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, what's that?

2285
02:40:57,863 --> 02:41:02,411
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a chase in Will Warriors with the burnout engine?

2286
02:41:03,574 --> 02:41:04,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, sweet!

2287
02:41:06,216 --> 02:41:06,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

2288
02:41:06,836 --> 02:41:13,700
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm kind of surprised we didn't get something in that whole racing game theme because there was so much good racing stuff.

2289
02:41:13,960 --> 02:41:17,482
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I did consider for a moment a Power Wheels racing game.

2290
02:41:19,183 --> 02:41:22,345
[SPEAKER_08]: That thought did cross my mind, but I like your idea a lot.

2291
02:41:22,465 --> 02:41:23,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, don't forget about Mask.

2292
02:41:23,925 --> 02:41:24,926
[SPEAKER_02]: That was also great.

2293
02:41:25,386 --> 02:41:28,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about the cartoon, but the toys were great.

2294
02:41:28,488 --> 02:41:30,089
[SPEAKER_02]: But on to what I was going to talk about...

2295
02:41:30,708 --> 02:41:37,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's still any people out there that were interested in the agency MMO that was supposed to come out like eons ago.

2296
02:41:37,473 --> 02:41:38,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, whatever happened to that?

2297
02:41:38,694 --> 02:41:39,675
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys remember this game?

2298
02:41:39,695 --> 02:41:40,355
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been following this?

2299
02:41:40,375 --> 02:41:43,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to still, supposedly it's still in development.

2300
02:41:43,117 --> 02:41:43,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I doubt that.

2301
02:41:44,058 --> 02:41:47,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been a long time since we've heard anything from it.

2302
02:41:47,501 --> 02:41:55,486
[SPEAKER_02]: But according to a lot of sources, they're all saying that the game's still coming out on PlayStation 3 and the PC, supposedly the PC before the PS3.

2303
02:41:56,067 --> 02:41:57,748
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

2304
02:41:57,768 --> 02:41:58,469
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of shaky.

2305
02:41:58,489 --> 02:42:00,090
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have some good news for people.

2306
02:42:00,902 --> 02:42:22,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Who may be still interested in that game There's a Facebook app Made by the developers of that game That you can actually play now It's kind of like Mafia Wars You know, the whole tech space type deal But it's a lot of fun, the presentation is really great And I'm enjoying it Awesome So, I might have missed it Have they nailed a release window for this yet?

2307
02:42:22,846 --> 02:42:24,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Or does it need to go through the extensive testing first?

2308
02:42:26,367 --> 02:42:28,927
[SPEAKER_02]: That, I don't know I mean, you guys can look that up Um

2309
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:32,642
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I know, they're reworking the game.

2310
02:42:32,682 --> 02:42:37,205
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't satisfied with what they originally had, the stuff that they were showing at E3.

2311
02:42:38,126 --> 02:42:41,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're supposedly rebuilding a whole other type of game.

2312
02:42:41,888 --> 02:42:43,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for whatever their reasons are,

2313
02:42:44,289 --> 02:42:47,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hope they didn't take out the feature where there was supposed to be some feature where...

2314
02:43:12,754 --> 02:43:14,816
[SPEAKER_02]: You could actually play the game through your cell phone.

2315
02:43:14,836 --> 02:43:26,246
[SPEAKER_02]: You were supposed to take on these little, I guess you would call them microagents, and they were supposed to build cars and gadgets for you, and you were supposed to be able to manage that through your cell phone somehow.

2316
02:43:26,967 --> 02:43:27,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was a great idea.

2317
02:43:27,907 --> 02:43:37,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the fact that they were taking MMO in another direction, so hopefully they're not coming out with just something like APB, where you're just running and gunning, and a whole lot of BS.

2318
02:43:38,656 --> 02:43:44,164
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like that idea of interacting with the cell phones more and other types of things like that.

2319
02:43:44,224 --> 02:43:49,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a really good use of... Sorry about that.

2320
02:43:49,772 --> 02:43:50,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody sent me a YouTube link.

2321
02:43:51,314 --> 02:43:52,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought it up a little soon.

2322
02:43:58,556 --> 02:44:00,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, that totally threw me.

2323
02:44:00,637 --> 02:44:01,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to go!

2324
02:44:02,157 --> 02:44:03,578
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, gosh, sorry about that.

2325
02:44:04,238 --> 02:44:10,880
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's kind of the way games like Warcraft and so forth are going where they're fully interactive with all these different types of platforms like the mobile phones and everything.

2326
02:44:12,220 --> 02:44:14,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's the way to go.

2327
02:44:14,541 --> 02:44:24,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I don't know if you remember what I called last week and I'm all about game innovation and I kind of agree with your previous caller that games need to be a little more innovative.

2328
02:44:24,524 --> 02:44:26,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not going to quit gaming anytime soon

2329
02:44:26,747 --> 02:44:33,049
[SPEAKER_02]: but they do need to come out with something more than just Call of Duty and all the other bullshit that they're coming out with.

2330
02:44:33,389 --> 02:44:36,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to really take advantage of what we have now.

2331
02:44:36,270 --> 02:44:39,451
[SPEAKER_02]: We have motion control crap, we have HD crap.

2332
02:44:39,491 --> 02:44:41,791
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so much that they can do with it.

2333
02:44:41,811 --> 02:44:51,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that it's a whole money management thing and there's a memory thing and there's a lot of balancing things that you have to do with the games but I know that they can do a lot better than what they're doing now.

2334
02:44:52,106 --> 02:45:19,684
[SPEAKER_08]: They can at least try Alright Alright, well we'll be keeping an eye on this game It does appear they're still targeting the second half of 2011 for this But it'll be done when it's done, darn it Yeah, and oh, that name of the app is The Agency Covert Ops Look for that on Facebook, that's the name of it That is available on Facebook And looks like it's been up since May of last year Missions, minigames, and sharing achievements with Facebook friends

2335
02:45:20,970 --> 02:45:22,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hang up and let the next caller come in.

2336
02:45:45,174 --> 02:45:46,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Some stuff coming out of CES.

2337
02:45:47,596 --> 02:45:58,803
[SPEAKER_05]: They're talking a little bit about Avatar Connect, which is going to be kind of a new chat method that you can use to actually chat with people and recognize facial expressions and stuff like that.

2338
02:45:59,303 --> 02:46:02,265
[SPEAKER_05]: So kind of mapping your voice to your avatar, which is kind of neat.

2339
02:46:03,105 --> 02:46:06,408
[SPEAKER_05]: and they'll be available for gold numbers later this spring.

2340
02:46:06,448 --> 02:46:08,649
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll use it once and then the thrill will be over.

2341
02:46:08,689 --> 02:46:11,431
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do like the idea like you can like publish it to Facebook and stuff.

2342
02:46:11,491 --> 02:46:14,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bet you we're going to start seeing podcasts recorded like this.

2343
02:46:14,353 --> 02:46:17,575
[SPEAKER_08]: We should do an episode of OLR like this, like a bonus episode of OLR.

2344
02:46:17,856 --> 02:46:18,516
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be funny.

2345
02:46:18,596 --> 02:46:19,457
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be kind of funny.

2346
02:46:20,117 --> 02:46:22,339
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like the one thing we have to do and then that'll be it.

2347
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:25,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other thing, I don't know if this pissed you off, Rob.

2348
02:46:26,162 --> 02:46:29,244
[SPEAKER_05]: They're talking about bringing Game Room to the Windows Phone 7.

2349
02:46:32,006 --> 02:46:33,507
[SPEAKER_08]: TurboGrafx Games coming to the Playstation Network

2350
02:46:58,484 --> 02:47:01,605
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can play games like Keith Courage that weren't very good.

2351
02:47:02,665 --> 02:47:04,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, these are from Hudson.

2352
02:47:04,286 --> 02:47:05,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me started.

2353
02:47:05,386 --> 02:47:08,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Alien Crush, Bomberman 94, Box Adventure.

2354
02:47:08,107 --> 02:47:09,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them were good.

2355
02:47:10,068 --> 02:47:19,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Dungeon Explorer, New Adventure Islands, Soldier Blades, Superstar Soldier, Victory Run, World Sports Competition, and Newtopia.

2356
02:47:19,811 --> 02:47:21,051
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I got a call waiting.

2357
02:47:21,071 --> 02:47:23,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Newtopia is a great game, and it's a lot like Zelda.

2358
02:47:23,492 --> 02:47:24,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go to the phones.

2359
02:47:24,512 --> 02:47:26,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Haven't you done a classic game of the week?

2360
02:47:26,113 --> 02:47:27,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I have done Newtopia.

2361
02:47:27,253 --> 02:47:28,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me go to the phones because I got somebody waiting.

2362
02:47:28,834 --> 02:47:29,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2363
02:47:29,834 --> 02:47:30,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2364
02:47:30,774 --> 02:47:31,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is X-Link.

2365
02:47:31,695 --> 02:47:32,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, X-Link.

2366
02:47:32,235 --> 02:47:32,915
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2367
02:47:33,375 --> 02:47:34,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, nothing much.

2368
02:47:34,115 --> 02:47:39,137
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes games and stuff, sometimes I can understand the other color a while back.

2369
02:47:39,197 --> 02:47:43,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's been times when I step back from playing video games for a while because, you know, you get burned out.

2370
02:47:43,639 --> 02:47:45,920
[SPEAKER_00]: You play stuff, you know, you think a lot of stuff comes out.

2371
02:47:45,940 --> 02:47:46,920
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.

2372
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:52,282
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, you know, I take a few days off, maybe read some books.

2373
02:47:52,362 --> 02:47:54,083
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they come back and do something else.

2374
02:47:54,163 --> 02:47:54,603
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know,

2375
02:47:55,844 --> 02:48:22,945
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's something out there for a little bit for everyone and yeah and as I was telling you earlier they should make Millie Bourne into another PC game if they I mean I know there was one a long time ago but I think they should make that into another one I have a indie app on my iTouch that I bought from the store that was 99 cents that was kind of the card game though it's not the official version but it plays the same way which is really cool

2376
02:48:24,546 --> 02:48:27,408
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like playing all kinds of different stuff.

2377
02:48:27,448 --> 02:48:38,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Roleplaying, card games, you know, games like Super Meat Boy, Nick's Quest was another good one I had played for a bit, you know, first person shooters.

2378
02:48:39,057 --> 02:48:46,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I get bored of one thing, I kind of switch it around to another thing so that way I don't get too burnt out on playing one genre of a

2379
02:48:47,243 --> 02:48:48,924
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not bad advice at all.

2380
02:48:49,064 --> 02:49:00,507
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially, you know, with thanks to the magic of emulators, or I'm sorry, virtual console, you know, you can have a variety of different games, you know, especially the old school stuff, you know, because that's what our listener seemed to enjoy that you can go back and forth to.

2381
02:49:00,827 --> 02:49:06,228
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, one odd suggestion maybe I would have for that listener, and maybe this is one of those things where I'll get laughed out of the room.

2382
02:49:06,648 --> 02:49:31,049
[SPEAKER_08]: but maybe that person should try an MMO maybe if games were a little more social I don't know like for me like WoW being the big social thing it is kind of keeps me is what keeps me coming back to that game but at the same time and there's a lot of free ones too there's I mean I used to play before I played WoW I played a Persona one that they had that was totally free so I mean

2383
02:49:32,077 --> 02:49:35,958
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to really pay to play, so to speak.

2384
02:49:36,258 --> 02:49:37,619
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of free stuff out there.

2385
02:49:37,859 --> 02:49:42,740
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be another niche or something else totally different out there.

2386
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:46,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think there's anything wrong, though, with the advice of, if you think you're bored of video games, take a break.

2387
02:49:47,021 --> 02:49:47,901
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing wrong with it.

2388
02:49:47,921 --> 02:49:49,382
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to game every single day.

2389
02:49:49,402 --> 02:49:50,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to think any less of you.

2390
02:49:50,602 --> 02:49:51,762
[SPEAKER_08]: None of us will.

2391
02:49:51,862 --> 02:49:52,983
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true, but that's all right.

2392
02:49:53,003 --> 02:49:53,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop.

2393
02:49:54,163 --> 02:49:57,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Go watch some movies or catch up on TV shows.

2394
02:49:57,766 --> 02:49:59,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Go read a book.

2395
02:49:59,328 --> 02:50:00,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Go start another project.

2396
02:50:01,109 --> 02:50:03,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And then maybe you'll find that game that wants to bring you back.

2397
02:50:04,692 --> 02:50:09,937
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of interesting, too, when you're talking about this whole, you know, about being lazy and stuff.

2398
02:50:09,977 --> 02:50:11,518
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because mostly because technology.

2399
02:50:11,578 --> 02:50:18,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Our technology has grown so rapidly, so quickly, and it's so easy to access a lot of different stuff so quickly.

2400
02:50:19,125 --> 02:50:19,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Like,

2401
02:50:19,765 --> 02:50:21,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I need to go to the library to check out a book?

2402
02:50:21,707 --> 02:50:26,192
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go online and buy the book straight from Amazon and get it right here in my own living room.

2403
02:50:27,173 --> 02:50:34,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, with technology, there's always pros and cons to everything.

2404
02:50:34,481 --> 02:50:40,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, a pro thing is it's quicker and easier, but a con is that we don't do as much as we used to.

2405
02:50:42,009 --> 02:50:48,494
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to a point in society now it's like we want things almost virtually handed to us because we're like, well, we can get this this way.

2406
02:50:48,514 --> 02:50:49,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't we do this?

2407
02:50:50,216 --> 02:51:00,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to admit I've bought a book on my iPhone before and one of the reasons I kind of like that sort of technology is that I have the book with me everywhere I go in case I'm ever bored.

2408
02:51:00,604 --> 02:51:02,386
[SPEAKER_08]: That way I'm not carrying around a bulky book.

2409
02:51:03,807 --> 02:51:07,650
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of the one really advantage I like of having it on there.

2410
02:51:07,990 --> 02:51:12,712
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do also understand, you know, there's really no substitute for an old dusty book.

2411
02:51:13,392 --> 02:51:13,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2412
02:51:14,333 --> 02:51:16,333
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, but, you know, I still read books.

2413
02:51:16,373 --> 02:51:20,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I have plenty of books on my shelf that I read that's actual physical books.

2414
02:51:20,275 --> 02:51:21,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, not everything is the e-book.

2415
02:51:22,016 --> 02:51:23,236
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clearly my strategy guides.

2416
02:51:23,276 --> 02:51:30,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have a lot of limited edition strategy guides that I like to have just for, you know, collector's edition just for, you know, to have on my shelves because I like looking at them.

2417
02:51:31,120 --> 02:51:34,361
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you know, so, I mean, there's...

2418
02:51:35,274 --> 02:51:55,126
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of funny when you're saying that because that brought me back to the whole thing back when I was taking technology ed class in high school and we're talking about, you know, because of all these pros there's going to be cons, you know, like fast food and movies and now we got books and video games and, you know, we don't have to do as much as we used to to get what we want.

2419
02:51:55,246 --> 02:51:59,228
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay, I press a few buttons or click on a few things and boom, there it is, so.

2420
02:52:01,340 --> 02:52:02,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom, there it is.

2421
02:52:02,442 --> 02:52:04,465
[SPEAKER_08]: That's definitely the culture we live in now.

2422
02:52:06,569 --> 02:52:10,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, X-Link, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for the call as always.

2423
02:52:11,885 --> 02:52:14,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And how proud are you of Jamie and her level 63?

2424
02:52:14,128 --> 02:52:15,088
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very proud of her.

2425
02:52:15,489 --> 02:52:16,570
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 levels in one week.

2426
02:52:16,650 --> 02:52:19,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus, I can't do anything more.

2427
02:52:19,152 --> 02:52:20,373
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get explicit for it.

2428
02:52:20,874 --> 02:52:22,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but, yeah, damn.

2429
02:52:23,416 --> 02:52:24,577
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm going to say is damn.

2430
02:52:24,597 --> 02:52:25,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't believe that.

2431
02:52:25,738 --> 02:52:27,180
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 levels in almost a week.

2432
02:52:27,700 --> 02:52:29,082
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just amazing.

2433
02:52:29,282 --> 02:52:31,684
[SPEAKER_00]: That really, congratulations.

2434
02:52:31,904 --> 02:52:32,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2435
02:52:32,745 --> 02:52:34,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you as well for the gift.

2436
02:52:34,867 --> 02:52:35,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to say anything.

2437
02:52:56,909 --> 02:52:58,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Play a game how you want to play a game.

2438
02:52:58,550 --> 02:52:59,111
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

2439
02:52:59,151 --> 02:53:12,005
[SPEAKER_08]: But just for you to blow through 30 levels in a week just kind of made me laugh a little bit because I'm just kind of like, man, I know other people that are just like they don't even do a level a month.

2440
02:53:12,546 --> 02:53:16,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still going to see if it's possible for me to make 85 before classes start next week.

2441
02:53:16,775 --> 02:53:25,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it took me to get, it almost took me a year to get to 80, but that's only because I was only playing a few times a week, and I was just doing it a few hours a day.

2442
02:53:25,999 --> 02:53:30,542
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, how was I getting to 82, Rob, again, when I got Kata?

2443
02:53:30,982 --> 02:53:31,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Archeology whoring.

2444
02:53:32,022 --> 02:53:33,263
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, there we go.

2445
02:53:33,603 --> 02:53:34,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-stop.

2446
02:53:34,584 --> 02:53:36,064
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that was a lot of fun.

2447
02:53:36,204 --> 02:53:37,545
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are going to have to show me the ropes.

2448
02:53:38,165 --> 02:53:38,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I will.

2449
02:53:38,866 --> 02:53:45,609
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing, though, is that, and this is, I think, what chased me off before, is the whole feeling like I'm being forced to play with people.

2450
02:53:46,389 --> 02:53:46,730
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?

2451
02:53:47,530 --> 02:53:48,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do whatever you want to do.

2452
02:53:48,812 --> 02:53:53,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, you had to open the invitation to our raids on Wednesday, and if you want to, that's fine.

2453
02:53:53,196 --> 02:53:54,077
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, you don't.

2454
02:53:54,237 --> 02:53:55,338
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no right or wrong.

2455
02:53:55,679 --> 02:53:56,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no.

2456
02:53:56,399 --> 02:53:57,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that.

2457
02:53:57,801 --> 02:54:04,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been getting the, oh, the whole game experience is when you're playing with doing, you know, the dungeon thing with a lot of people, and...

2458
02:54:05,362 --> 02:54:07,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I've been enjoying playing by myself.

2459
02:54:07,823 --> 02:54:08,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I like playing with one or two people.

2460
02:54:08,923 --> 02:54:15,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly, and I'm not going to say too much on this because I know people are going to get shut off, but just like, oh shit, they're talking about WoW.

2461
02:54:15,764 --> 02:54:25,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob invited me to WoW a year ago, and when I started playing, I thought for sure that it was going to be kind of like, okay, Rob's going to show me ropes, and I'm going to do all this stuff, and this is going to be great, and blah, blah, blah.

2462
02:54:25,567 --> 02:54:26,667
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Rob had his own thing.

2463
02:54:26,687 --> 02:54:29,788
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really busy with work and whatnot.

2464
02:54:29,828 --> 02:54:34,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob contestants, there were times when I had played with them, but for the most part, between me getting to 1 in 80...

2465
02:54:35,389 --> 02:54:43,333
[SPEAKER_00]: was, other than the help from another guildie of ours, whoever my name was, that I did 90% of that stuff on my own.

2466
02:54:44,414 --> 02:55:00,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through, I went through all the pugging stuff, through the dungeons and everything else, but for most parts, I did non-stop questing from day one when I started to when I got to like 80.

2467
02:55:02,023 --> 02:55:04,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Among a few odds and ends and PvP and whatnot, but

2468
02:55:06,827 --> 02:55:08,589
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun playing by myself.

2469
02:55:08,769 --> 02:55:10,431
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the few games I can actually say.

2470
02:55:10,471 --> 02:55:12,694
[SPEAKER_00]: You can play by yourself and have a lot of fun doing it.

2471
02:55:14,316 --> 02:55:14,977
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like.

2472
02:55:17,240 --> 02:55:19,602
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to play with six of my friends in order to get this done.

2473
02:55:20,512 --> 02:55:21,873
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is fun to play with your friends, too.

2474
02:55:21,893 --> 02:55:23,514
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what keeps me in WoW is raiding.

2475
02:55:23,534 --> 02:55:24,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, by far.

2476
02:55:25,256 --> 02:55:31,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, anyhow, I gotta let you go before we have Horde House to spin off here, but thank you so much for your call, okay, buddy?

2477
02:55:31,620 --> 02:55:32,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime, anytime.

2478
02:55:32,641 --> 02:55:32,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

2479
02:55:34,002 --> 02:55:42,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I think pretty soon, especially when you hit about maybe level 70 or so, we're gonna have to, well, maybe soon, we'll have to run you into some dungeons and show you the ropes in dungeons.

2480
02:55:43,750 --> 02:55:49,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to basically learn how to play with other people so if I decide that I want to be social, that I'm not going to kill everybody.

2481
02:55:49,994 --> 02:55:54,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have a problem of accidentally casting my area of effect.

2482
02:55:54,458 --> 02:56:03,163
[SPEAKER_08]: The dark side of pug groups is that they're not always noob friendly and they expect that you know everything and you may not and that's very unfortunate.

2483
02:56:03,203 --> 02:56:04,905
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, let's move on.

2484
02:56:05,045 --> 02:56:06,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to get too far into wild talk.

2485
02:56:07,487 --> 02:56:07,767
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2486
02:56:07,847 --> 02:56:09,289
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to do it, though, for the Skype line tonight.

2487
02:56:09,310 --> 02:56:11,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much for your calls.

2488
02:56:11,212 --> 02:56:11,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Really appreciate it.

2489
02:56:12,474 --> 02:56:18,162
[SPEAKER_08]: If you didn't get through, send us an email, mailbag at orangeloundtrader.com or a tweet at twitter.com slash OLR.

2490
02:56:18,182 --> 02:56:19,985
[SPEAKER_08]: There's plenty of ways to interact with our program.

2491
02:56:20,245 --> 02:56:21,627
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also the live chat room every week.

2492
02:56:22,188 --> 02:56:24,568
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?

2493
02:56:24,588 --> 02:56:29,509
[SPEAKER_08]: 85 by Wednesday Good luck Not 85, I meant 65 Oh yeah, you can do it 65 by tomorrow I don't know your schedule, maybe

2494

2495
02:56:53,921 --> 02:56:55,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what's your final thought?

2496
02:56:57,243 --> 02:56:57,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2497
02:56:57,803 --> 02:56:58,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Tron.

2498
02:56:59,824 --> 02:57:05,027
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie.

2499
02:57:05,047 --> 02:57:06,108
[SPEAKER_04]: She just came waddling out.

2500
02:57:06,328 --> 02:57:06,628
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

2501
02:57:06,668 --> 02:57:08,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Now she's just sitting there waiting to poop.

2502
02:57:09,530 --> 02:57:10,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, baby cakes.

2503
02:57:11,431 --> 02:57:11,751
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2504
02:57:11,771 --> 02:57:12,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say something to everybody?

2505
02:57:12,611 --> 02:57:13,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about the tester.

2506
02:57:13,672 --> 02:57:16,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Say something to the listeners, baby.

2507
02:57:17,154 --> 02:57:19,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think Shermie is very talkative.

2508
02:57:20,812 --> 02:57:21,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeremy's like, what the hell is that?

2509
02:57:21,853 --> 02:57:22,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Get that out of my face.

2510
02:57:22,994 --> 02:57:23,575
[SPEAKER_08]: No comment.

2511
02:57:24,315 --> 02:57:24,575
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, if you like what you heard, we don't make any money off of the show.

2515

[SPEAKER_08]: All we ask is that you tell one or two people about the show.

2516
02:57:35,205 --> 02:57:41,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Help us spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio, especially as we approach our 400th episode next month.

2517
02:57:41,390 --> 02:57:42,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe it.

2518
02:57:42,551 --> 02:57:43,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys again.

[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you next week.

[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be back here to do it all again.

2522
02:57:47,853 --> 02:57:51,796
[SPEAKER_08]: with a three-day weekend, by the way, for me next week.

2523
02:57:51,816 --> 02:57:51,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

2524
02:57:52,116 --> 02:57:52,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Drunk show.

2525
02:57:52,596 --> 02:57:55,738
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know what antics might, if I could get a ride home somehow.

2526
02:57:56,999 --> 02:57:58,180
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sleep on the couch.

2527
02:57:58,320 --> 02:57:59,641
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know what antics might happen.

2528
02:57:59,661 --> 02:58:00,481
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sleep in the vault and freeze.

2529
02:58:00,501 --> 02:58:02,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to do a drunk show next week that bad?

2530
02:58:02,603 --> 02:58:03,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you drink?

2531
02:58:03,123 --> 02:58:04,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I know he won't.

2532
02:58:04,224 --> 02:58:04,564
[SPEAKER_08]: He can't.

2533
02:58:04,584 --> 02:58:06,225
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got to be a responsible daddy, but will you?

2534
02:58:06,365 --> 02:58:06,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I will.

2535
02:58:07,486 --> 02:58:08,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2536
02:58:08,767 --> 02:58:15,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's been that long, I will get nice and toasty on air for listeners if I can figure out a ride home or something.

2537
02:58:15,754 --> 02:58:15,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2538
02:58:16,114 --> 02:58:18,216
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe I'll see if somebody can drive me to the show.

2539
02:58:18,236 --> 02:58:18,537
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2540
02:58:18,897 --> 02:58:19,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2541
02:58:19,398 --> 02:58:19,638
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2542
02:58:21,359 --> 02:58:23,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So lots to look forward to next week.

2543
02:58:23,181 --> 02:58:23,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, warn Dan.

2544
02:58:24,182 --> 02:58:24,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night, everybody.

2545
02:58:25,808 --> 02:58:28,510
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2546
02:58:56,789 --> 02:58:58,016
Thanks for watching!
