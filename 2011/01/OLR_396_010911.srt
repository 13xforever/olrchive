00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,320
Today, January 9th, 2011, a popular PC game prepares for release on Xbox Live.

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,720
More details come out about the next Elder Scrolls game, and EA prepares to disconnect

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,400
the servers for several old games.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,080
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,560
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,240
We do tape live at All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

7
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,080
ish right after the Bobby Black Wolf show wraps up.

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,400
We really like Bobby because he always has us on our show and does this nice little transition.

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,640
Tonight, we were talking about light-up cereal boxes, but before we get to yummy delicious

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,800
electrical cereal, let me introduce the cast and crew here at Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,040
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always is the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Summers.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Hi.

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
How are you?

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
I'm hungry.

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,560
What would you prefer, electric Trix or electric Honey Nut Cheerios?

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Neither.

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
Why?

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Because I hate both of them.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,160
Well, what electric cereal would you like?

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
Frosted mini-wheats.

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,480
Grape nuts.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,040
I do adore grape nuts, but I'd have to say my favorite cereal of all time is frosted

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,440
mini-wheats.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll get to my favorite cereal in a minute, and yes, we'll talk about games too, but say

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,520
hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,520
Hi.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
Hi.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
How are you, Loki?

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
I'm fine.

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,720
I'm finishing my last piece of honey barbecue chicken.

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,600
What was your favorite cereal growing up, honey barbecue chicken nuggets?

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Hell no.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200
Actually, you know, it's kind of funny.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,240
I like both extremes of cereal.

36
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,760
Like, really bad for me cereal and really good for me cereal.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
It's weird.

38
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,520
Like, I used to, and I still do, like Special K. Yes, the chick cereal.

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
It does not...

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
I forgot about that.

41
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,680
That's one of the greatest moments of this show's history was when it came out that you

42
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,360
enjoyed Special K.

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
It's pretty good, actually.

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Cereal for women.

45
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
It's not bad.

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,340
You know, Special K, I actually, long time ago, I used to like Total and Product 19.

47
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,160
You know what got me hooked on that stuff is, you know how they used to give you, like,

48
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,160
when you buy the camping packs of the little cereals and stuff like that, and you'd be

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,440
left, after you eat all the good ones, you're left with, like, okay, Special K and stuff.

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
And they're not bad.

51
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,600
I mean, so it kind of got me hooked on that.

52
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,200
But on the other side of the spectrum, and I go through about a box of this a week, Cap'n

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Crunch.

54
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Really?

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,200
The one that is always last in the package for me is Lucky Charms.

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,000
I hate Lucky Charms.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,800
And well, Cinnamon Toes Crunch, but here's the thing about Cinnamon Toes Crunch, I hate

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
it with milk.

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,680
So I have to eat it dry, and it's just really, because all the cinnamon falls off.

60
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,760
I don't like cereal with milk at all.

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,280
I eat all my cereal dry.

62
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,600
Like I know that's really weird to some people, but that's how I do it.

63
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,120
You know, the other one is really addicting?

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,760
Was it Golden Grahams?

65
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,400
I can't stop eating that stuff.

66
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,200
Now, you can't have a video game show and talk about cereal without bringing up Nintendo

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
cereal.

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,280
Did anyone ever try that when they were younger?

69
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
I liked it.

70
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
I thought it was hideous.

71
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
Really?

72
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
I didn't mind it.

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
I thought it was pretty good.

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
I didn't like kid cereals.

75
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
I hated marshmallows.

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
I still hate marshmallows.

77
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,640
Nintendo cereal was closest probably to Froot Loops, because I still remember it was more

78
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,480
like fruity and sugary.

79
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
I think that would be the taste it was close to.

80
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,240
See, Froot Loops weren't really big on my plate either.

81
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
I mean, they were okay.

82
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,560
I just, I didn't like- I don't remember Nintendo cereal having marshmallows.

83
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
I don't think it did.

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,520
Let's break into the shredded wheat.

85
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,440
I would say my favorite breakfast cereal of all time, and this might surprise some people,

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
is Crispix.

87
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,160
Oh, Crispix is good.

88
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
That's the one that's-

89
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
I fucking love Crispix.

90
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,720
That's like half rice on one side, half corn on the other.

91
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Oh, that stuff's good.

92
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
And gluten-free.

93
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
I don't know what it is.

94
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
It's amazing.

95
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
It's my favorite cereal.

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
It's not even a sugar candy cereal.

97
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,120
Damn, I need to get a box of that.

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,680
It's so good.

99
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
It's the texture.

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Like, I can't- it's so gross, but it's the truth.

101
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,480
Like, I love putting Crispix and then, like, using my tongue to smash it to little bits.

102
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm like, haha, and then eat it.

103
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,200
I used to do that, too.

104
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,520
Everybody does it, just no one talks about it.

105
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,360
And then I would eat one half of one side, and then eat the other half.

106
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,240
It's like eating an Oreo with no cream filling.

107
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
It's with milk filling.

108
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,680
I remember when they first brought Crispix out.

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,560
I mean, that was something that came out later on in my life.

110
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,760
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room.

111
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,440
Of course, we have to introduce the chat room.

112
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,760
We love the chatters.

113
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,860
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

114
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,160
Dark Tetsuya wants to know, are there any cereal podcasts out there?

115
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,200
I don't know, but maybe we need to start one.

116
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,320
We'll have to look for one.

117
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,400
I don't know.

118
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,800
And many folks in our chat room agree- Yes, there's one called the Ethereal Cereal

119
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Podcast.

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Shut up.

121
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Really?

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I just found it.

123
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Is it really about breakfast cereal?

124
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
That's what I'm going to find out.

125
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Or maybe it's just a funny name.

126
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Alright.

127
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,640
Well, anyhow, we will talk plenty more about breakfast cereal.

128
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,000
There's one called Get Cereal.

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Food and everything.

130
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,520
But we have to talk about our gaming weeks.

131
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,200
We've got to bring it back to video games.

132
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
It is a new year.

133
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
It's 2011.

134
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,360
It's kind of a tiny, tiny lull in new games right now, because everyone I think is catching

135
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,960
up from last year's games.

136
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,480
But things are going to hit the ground fast.

137
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,860
Little Big Planet 2, I believe, is this week.

138
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,800
And that's just going to be the first in several huge, huge releases.

139
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Oh, next week.

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Loki's correcting me.

141
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,280
I knew it was January, mid, somewhere.

142
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,140
But very soon, that's going to come out, and that's kind of the first of several bing-bing-bing

143
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,140
big stuff coming out.

144
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,140
DC Universes this week.

145
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,140
Oh, yeah.

146
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
DC Universes this week.

147
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,140
Thank you, Loki.

148
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,140
So I'm going to be quitting World of Warcraft.

149
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,720
When I played the beta on PC, I had a good time with it.

150
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,240
So I never did get around to playing the PS3 one, and they pulled the plug on it.

151
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,640
So I'm torn.

152
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,920
I don't know if I really want to get into DC Universe or not.

153
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,640
But anyway, I guess we can talk about that later.

154
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,880
Let's talk about what's going on right now in your gaming week.

155
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,080
Dark Sakura, start us off.

156
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,120
I hit level 63 right before the show.

157
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,820
I just can't believe this.

158
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,640
You hated World of Warcraft three weeks ago.

159
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
They changed it.

160
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
You know what's funny?

161
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,320
The podcast is behind right now, and I totally apologize.

162
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
That's my fault.

163
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,720
I've just been, you know, slacking, whatever.

164
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:16,380
But if you go listen to the last show on the feed right now, I'm pretty sure you were still

165
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,320
hating on World of Warcraft and Razami for playing it.

166
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,880
So podcaster-only people have no idea that you have now leveled to 63.

167
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,800
Not last week, because last week was after I got back from Washington.

168
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,120
No, the last show on the archives was-

169
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,840
Oh, on the archives, yeah, yeah, no.

170
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,480
Well, they changed enough in it that I was like, okay, I gotta give it a try.

171
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,120
Because you know me, I'm not gonna bitch about something without having tried it myself.

172
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Good.

173
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,600
I think that's a good thing to do.

174
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,200
I mean, and besides that, I just like fucking with you guys, you know?

175
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
No, I know, I know.

176
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,840
It's just like I mess with you for some of the things you like, but secretly it's all

177
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
right.

178
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
It's fine.

179
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,760
Which for the record, I haven't touched Second Life since the last time I said I haven't

180
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
touched Second Life.

181
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,840
And for the record, Grape Nuts aren't so bad.

182
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
They're actually pretty good.

183
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Grape Nuts are great.

184
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
They're great!

185
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Anyway.

186
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,440
I, on the other hand, think Grape Nuts are nasty, and you really shouldn't touch Second

187
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,120
Life ever.

188
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,920
Some things never change on this program.

189
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:22,280
So anyway, anyway, um, I, well, okay, I know last week, live, I, you know, mentioned that

190
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,200
I had really hurt my lower back, my, it was technically my right hip.

191
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Really bad.

192
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,720
Although it's more funny to say I sprained my butt, because really it's-

193
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,080
You broke your butt, ugh!

194
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,880
But, um, I've been seeing my chiropractor, like, I have one more appointment to go to,

195
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,820
and it still hurts, but it's not nearly as the debilitating pain I was in before.

196
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,840
So like, all I could do is just sit here, on an ice pack, and play World of Warcraft,

197
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
because what else was there for me to do?

198
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,240
I've done everything in Star Trek Online, and I still love Star Trek Online so much,

199
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,680
but all I was doing was freaking playing Dabo.

200
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800
And there's only so much gambling one can do.

201
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,720
I really like this point in our chat room here from Salacious Pop.

202
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,640
In my opinion, this just proves that Blizzard properly redid the experience in Cata, which

203
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
was the point.

204
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,240
1-60 was still from 2004 and shitty.

205
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,000
If Jamie likes it now, then they really gave it an overhaul.

206
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah.

207
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,960
Well, and now Dan was like, oh, they dumbed it down for people so that people can, you

208
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,060
know, have a more rewarding experience, and blah blah blah.

209
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,720
And I was like, you know, when I first, when I first started playing, this was, you know,

210
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,960
when I got Burning Crusade.

211
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,820
When it was new.

212
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,080
It was like, okay, I've done everything, I'm not going anywhere.

213
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,800
I've done all this, I'm not going anywhere.

214
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,960
Fucking boring.

215
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,260
Same gameplay over and over and over and over and nothing interesting.

216
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,840
And I think that's a big part of the change too.

217
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,820
I don't want to go too far into this, because again, we have the Separate Warcraft show

218
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,480
now that, you know, because we talk too much about it on this show, but it's important

219
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,520
because where Warcraft goes, like it or not, it is the biggest MMO right now.

220
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,000
The rest of the industry will follow, you know, with some exceptions, which we'll get

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,160
into even later in the show.

222
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:08,420
But my point, in Old Vanilla WoW, a lot of the quests were fetch me animal pelts, kill

223
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,760
X number of monsters.

224
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
And they still have a lot of that.

225
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,460
And there is a lot of that, but they've also mixed in a lot of more interesting technology

226
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,240
from the newer expansions, like vehicle stuff from Rapid Listing.

227
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,600
Use this item to scrape tar off this creature's ass.

228
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
Yes, things like that.

229
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,160
You know what I'm talking about too, don't you?

230
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,000
Uh, no one, because I haven't done that quest, but did you get to dig through the poop for

231
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
the key?

232
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No.

233
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That quest I did.

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I did see the one.

235
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,560
Okay, now Tiara showed me this one.

236
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,160
It was where you go to, um, oh crap, what's the, not the Outlands, but the place where

237
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
everything's red.

238
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,480
It has the big scar.

239
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Barrens?

240
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Badlands.

241
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Okay.

242
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
Oh.

243
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,280
And, because keep in mind, I'm still learning what everything's called, so.

244
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:57,000
And um, and you run into a gnome, a dwarf, and uh, uh, something else.

245
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,240
A pizza place?

246
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
No.

247
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
And they, no they don't.

248
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
I see what you did there.

249
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,400
And it's not a setup for a bad joke, but it's like, the dwarf is like, I went up to Death

250
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,000
Winger and I punched him in the face!

251
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
I was watching this video of this guy playing through it and he was doing all the voices

252
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,680
and everything, and I was like, this is the funniest shit I've ever seen.

253
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,880
And then the gnome was like, oh yeah, well I shrunk the world and looked for him in the

254
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,800
clouds, and then I threw him on that other continent, so nah.

255
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,200
And then the last one's like, I got on my motorcycle and picked up some hot babes, and

256
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,360
we had a tender moment.

257
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,520
Oh, that's the one where one of the hot babes is a blood elf male.

258
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Yeah.

259
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
I remember that, yeah.

260
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Alright, I've seen that.

261
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Yeah.

262
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Good times.

263
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,040
Um, but it was, it was just, but basically they were all telling tall tales and it was

264
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
really funny.

265
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
It was cute.

266
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,880
What I like is that there's a lot more comedy thrown in there.

267
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,240
It's like the quest to have the names that make me laugh my ass off.

268
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,360
And I'm still pissed off at that stupid dragon for setting the world on fire and not setting

269
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,040
me on fire.

270
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,440
Stupid fucking dragon.

271
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,040
You were, you were online with me for this.

272
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
I was.

273
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,360
And you're like, I'm standing in the fire and not dying.

274
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
What is wrong?

275
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,980
I took a screen capture of me in the fire not dying.

276
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,160
I wanted the damn achievement.

277
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,400
And then I got, I got achievements that you don't have.

278
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Whatever.

279
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Thanks to X-Link.

280
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
No one, Ker.

281
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Alright.

282
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,760
What else besides wow have you been playing?

283
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,240
Well, also thank you for the thing that you sort of were in on.

284
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
You're welcome.

285
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
I got 800 gold.

286
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
I'm gonna go buy me a bird.

287
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,280
Um, no, I was playing other stuff, um, though it was really solitaire.

288
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
And Mushihime Sama!

289
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,240
Cause that game is crack.

290
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,760
I tell you, Cave fans, if you want a little fun, uh, it's still bullet hell.

291
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,000
It's just bullet hell with running.

292
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,040
And like, you target stuff and then you let your things fall but you still have to avoid

293
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
the bullet.

294
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
It's, it's bullet hell.

295
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,720
It's bullet hell on feet.

296
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,160
Well hell.

297
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
It's great.

298
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Alright.

299
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Loki, how was your gaming week?

300
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Um, it was okay.

301
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,440
Um, I played a few different things this week.

302
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,080
Um, I played The Flying Hamster, which is pretty awesome.

303
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:09,040
It was a game that was a PSP mini at one point and I just brought it over to the iOS platform

304
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,200
and it's a kind of a shooter game where you play a chibi flying hamster who has to save

305
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,960
his hamster girlfriend or something like that and it's a shooter and it's really hard actually

306
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,280
but it's all chibi and it's kind of cool.

307
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,960
So I played that.

308
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,760
And then, uh, more Sword and Poker 2.

309
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,880
I'm actually almost done with that game.

310
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,760
I'm in the last dungeon and I'm maybe six floors in, so that's pretty cool.

311
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,040
Um, what else did I play?

312
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,880
I think I played a little bit more, uh, Cannibalt, which is fun.

313
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,600
Um, what else?

314
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,320
Oh yeah.

315
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,720
And then more Grand Theft Auto, but finally after working on it for six months we got

316
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,840
our new modded games running again and I tell you that first game is the most fun I've had

317
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,560
playing Grand Theft Auto in six months.

318
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:10,720
It's just so incredibly different because the last, just the normal prank games that

319
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,400
we play and stuff, I'm very concerned about winning and a lot of time my co-workers, I

320
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,800
should say almost all the time, my co-workers aren't having as much fun as they could be

321
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,680
having because I usually am kicking the crap out of them.

322
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,900
Um, whereas the mod games, everybody has fun and it's just so over the top, like I was

323
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,120
hysterically laughing throughout the whole game because just all this crazy shit was

324
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,860
happening and it was just, it was awesome.

325
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,000
So I'm looking forward to playing more of that.

326
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,520
This time though we hot swapped all of our drives so we don't get banned, or so our consoles

327
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,000
don't get banned this time.

328
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,920
I'm pretty fast at it now, I can hot swap a console in about 15 minutes, it's like field

329
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
stripping a gun or something.

330
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,520
It's pretty quick, um, so yeah I played that and then um, actually looking forward to playing

331
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,080
some new games soon, hopefully, well I'm going to pick up a little big planet.

332
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,260
I have the collector's edition on order because I want those bookends and the little stuffed

333
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:21,760
plush sack boy for my desk and then um, actually that's probably going to be the new thing

334
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
I'm going to play for a while.

335
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,660
I am going to actually finally update my console now that certain hacks have come out that

336
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,360
allow custom firmwares and whatnot, so, on any firmware console, yeah.

337
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,880
You want to get Linux on your good ol' PS3 again, huh?

338
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,120
I don't really want even Linux and here's the thing is I had the opportunity to actually

339
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,140
you know, mod my console to where I could pirate games on it, but I just didn't want

340
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,480
to pirate games on the PS3 and that's saying something.

341
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,280
And it's not a good something.

342
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,440
Alright, uh, let's see, moving on to my gaming week.

343
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,360
Sadly I don't have a lot of new new stuff to report.

344
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,060
It's uh, I haven't had a lot of money to buy a lot of extra games lately so it's mostly

345
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,560
the same stuff I was talking about last week with Fallout 3 and continuing on White Knight

346
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,600
Chronicles a little more, although I have to admit the online stuff still doesn't make

347
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,200
sense to me, but whatever, at least my internet is somewhat cooperating so I can keep a connection

348
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,760
to PlayStation Network now.

349
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
So that's nice.

350
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,760
So I guess I'll dip in a little bit and talk about some iPhone games that I've checked

351
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,440
out recently.

352
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,040
One of them that I think you guys would like, and this was something that somebody had shouted

353
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,560
out to me on Twitter and I so apologize because I forgot who sent this to me on Twitter, but

354
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,300
it's a game called VGMC or Video Game Music Challenge and it's free on the App Store and

355
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:49,880
all it is is it plays like theme songs from old school video games and you're given options

356
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,160
on the screen and you have to guess what the song is.

357
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,220
For example, want to play along guys?

358
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,720
Let's see how well you guys do.

359
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,600
So I'm in the menu of Video Game Music Challenge right now and let's see how well you guys

360
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
do.

361
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Here's the first one.

362
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Ready?

363
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Anyone?

364
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Anyone know this one?

365
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
This one's hard.

366
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I'm going to try Paperboy.

367
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Correct.

368
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:23,320
Here's another one.

369
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Mario 3, right?

370
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Yeah.

371
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
So that probably doesn't pick up on the speaker.

372
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,240
It's all kind of middied.

373
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
A little bit.

374
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Yeah.

375
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
It's not like the original, original stuff, but it's all middied.

376
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
But hey, it was free.

377
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
So I think that's kind of cool.

378
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
I did play that too.

379
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
I forgot.

380
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Did you?

381
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
Yes.

382
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Yeah.

383
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,840
I played a little bit of Cut the Rope, the holiday edition, which is this really popular

384
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
iPhone game.

385
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
It's Cut the Rope.

386
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,860
But I'm cheap and I like to have a lot of the free demos before I buy games and so they

387
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,920
have this holiday edition that's free.

388
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,760
And it's basically a puzzle game.

389
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,400
But the cutest thing about it, and I think everyone would agree, would be the little

390
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,360
monster character that you're trying to feed the candy to, Om Nom Nom, is adorable.

391
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,000
And you have to like feed him the candy by choosing which ropes to cut.

392
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,720
And it's kind of like a gravity physics puzzler type of thing.

393
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
So it's fun.

394
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,240
I like that.

395
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,320
Tap Tap Revenge 4 is also out on the iTunes store.

396
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,440
That's one of those like you tap along to songs.

397
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,560
I'm going to admit, I used to like Tap Tap Revenge.

398
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,840
I don't like it anymore.

399
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,840
I think it really has become something, it's outgrown what it was.

400
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,640
In the first couple versions it was cool, but now it's all commercialized and it's about

401
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
selling the music.

402
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,560
And the interface is impossible to navigate because they're trying to push all these add-on

403
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,020
songs for money and it's like it's too hard to just get in there and like play a game.

404
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,020
The interface is shit.

405
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,060
I'm sorry, I don't have a nice way of saying it.

406
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,840
Like they have just destroyed the game because they're trying too hard to build this music

407
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,560
store around it.

408
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,760
And I don't need all this, I don't really like all this other bullshit like Open Faint

409
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,880
and I don't even like Game Center and some of this other stuff.

410
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,280
Like I really wish there was just one for all of it.

411
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:13,400
And to be honest, as much as I like Open Faint and what it's trying to do, we need one standard

412
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,360
across all the iPhone games.

413
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,680
And I think Apple ought to just step in and say, it's Game Center and get the fuck out.

414
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,360
We're going to stop approving your apps if it has any other shit in it.

415
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,760
Like I know that's like a terrible thing to say because Game Center is like the worst

416
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,380
of all of them, but maybe they can work with the Open Faint people, I don't know.

417
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,760
But I think it's ridiculous that you have like all these different games and they have

418
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
all these different adults.

419
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
They should just buy and absorb Open Faint.

420
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,540
Or something, I don't know.

421
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,880
So there's a lot of people that are going to really hate that I said that, but it's

422
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
just annoying.

423
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,680
I'm kind of, I kind of don't like either of them though.

424
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,640
I hate all these freaking pop-ups when I start games, sign up for Open Faint, sign up for

425
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
this network.

426
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Mine's like...

427
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
No!

428
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,040
I have an iPhone so I don't have to play with other people.

429
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
You know?

430
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Yeah.

431
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
So...

432
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,720
Hey, let your friends on Twitter and Facebook know that you're playing an Open Faint game.

433
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,280
I will post on Facebook if I want them to know I'm playing this game.

434
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,080
Like, it's getting to be too much.

435
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,840
I want a Facebook update every time I score a point.

436
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
No.

437
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,720
No, no, no.

438
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,240
And then, believe it or not, I downloaded Smurf Village on the iPhone.

439
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,720
It's stupid.

440
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
It's a Facebook game.

441
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,040
If you like those Facebook grindy games, then have fun.

442
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,800
I prefer Knights of the Clicky on Facebook, which, by the way, I got Xtiver to play, or

443
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,720
he played it, I don't know, because he heard one of us talking about it, and he said it

444
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,100
was the worst thing he'd ever played in his life.

445
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
Because Knights of the Crystal...

446
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,880
There really is no point in Knights of the Crystal.

447
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,720
It's Mafia Wars with Final Fantasy characters.

448
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,240
I pretty much stopped playing it.

449
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,040
I mean, I'm playing it some, like when I remember to, but when I was in Washington, I was like,

450
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,480
I couldn't keep up with it on my laptop, so I was like, eh.

451
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,320
Yeah, you kind of echo a lot of people that are kind of done with Knights of the Clicky.

452
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,360
Like once you beat that final boss, you can kind of grind old quests and stuff, but there's

453
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,800
not a lot else to do.

454
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,320
Now they did just recently release, I can't believe I'm talking about a Facebook game.

455
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,520
They released some new levels.

456
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,440
We really do need an official Knights of the Clicky starring Clicky the Pen.

457
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,520
A different show on the network owns the rights to that character, so we'll have to get agreements

458
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,760
and contracts.

459
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,320
You know, I haven't gotten to the last boss because I've actually been going through for

460
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,440
Gold Mastery on other levels, and now I'm like, this is boring!

461
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
What the crap am I doing?

462
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,300
I'm done.

463
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,040
Some comments in our chat room, some talk about Steam and Apple.

464
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,080
William Murderface says, Apple needs to get in bed with Steam already.

465
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,900
Act Def says Apple kind of already did that.

466
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,920
That's when Portal came out for free.

467
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
And that's true.

468
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
Steam is on the Apple system now, so.

469
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,320
Yeah, it's good for them, but I mean, no, Apple doesn't need to buy Steam.

470
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,880
There was some other big news in the Apple world, and we'll talk about that because we

471
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,680
have to, because it does affect video games.

472
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,040
We're going to talk about that a little later on in the program, but we'll wait until we

473
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
get there.

474
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,720
So, I really don't have anything else to share with my gaming week.

475
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,120
Not a lot of new console stuff, unfortunately.

476
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
It's been a little slow.

477
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,440
But hopefully as some of the new releases come out, I'll be picking them up and excited

478
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
about that.

479
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,480
I also really want to get LittleBigPlanet 2, so I think I'm going to have to do that.

480
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,840
Anyhow, let's move on into some housekeeping tonight.

481
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,400
No show stuff as far as I know, although I will say, it looks like we can kind of project

482
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,120
now when episode number 400 will be, although we have yet to plan anything special for it.

483
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:33,200
But if tonight is episode 396, then 397, 398, 399, episode number 400 of Orange Law and

484
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,720
Trade Deal will be February 6th of this year, assuming we do not miss any shows between

485
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
now and then.

486
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,800
Or do not have a show at 399 and a half.

487
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,920
So I don't know what's going to happen.

488
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,080
I know we had talked a while about maybe doing it at a pizza parlor or something and trying

489
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,640
to get some of the old crew together.

490
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,680
I don't know if that's feasible, but we'll try to do something fun for episode 400.

491
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,600
We're thinking about what we're going to do for that.

492
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,960
So that's really the only thing, because I don't know if there's a lot of gaming podcasts

493
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,160
that have hit episode 400 that are weekly.

494
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,840
I'm sure some daily ones have, but I don't know about any other weekly shows.

495
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,960
So if there are, I don't know of them, which would be a surprise at this point, because

496
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,080
that means you have to be doing a show for at least eight, nine years like we have.

497
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,600
So yeah, we'll be kind of doing something a little special for episode 400.

498
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,120
We just don't know what yet.

499
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,080
In good OLR fashion, we're procrastinating.

500
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,560
Otherwise, you can join us on Facebook, porn, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

501
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,000
Or how about another marathon episode?

502
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,760
You like those, right?

503
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,600
Or twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.

504
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,400
How about we get into some gaming news?

505
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,560
Hokies, start us off tonight with some gaming news.

506
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Yes.

507
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:47,440
So of course, there's some information, I mean, slightly before when the US announcement

508
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:56,200
and stuff comes out on the 19th, but some stuff about the 3DS launch in Japan.

509
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,440
They've announced 10 titles that are going to be expected for launch, I guess the Japanese

510
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,440
launch date will be February 26th.

511
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:13,780
And the titles you can expect, Winning Eleven 3DS, or 3D Soccer, get it, 3DS, Super Street

512
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:25,720
Fighter 4 3D Edition, Samurai Warriors Chronicle, looks like, Tobi Dasu, Puzzle Bobble 3D, Nintendogs

513
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:34,080
Plus Cats, wow, they're going to do 3 versions of that too, Toy Poodle and New Friends, French

514
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,940
Bulldog and New Friends, and Shiba and New Friends, yes, I will not be stupid this time

515
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:47,000
and buy all 3 versions, actually, I'll be smart this time and not buy any version, Ridge

516
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:56,200
Racer 3D, I don't know, I kinda want the kitties, I want the kitties too, Ridge Racer 3D, Combat

517
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:03,800
of Giants Dinosaur 3D, and Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle, so those are expected

518
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:11,240
out, also it says there's supposed to be some new titles announced as well, including

519
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,560
BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2, Imports of Tales of the Abyss, and Raving Rabbids Travel in

520
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:26,760
Time, as well as the third game in the Tank Beat series, so those are going to be some

521
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,880
launch titles, no real word on what the pricing is going to be over here yet, but in Japan

522
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:45,720
it looks like they're kind of ranging around 4980 yen to say about 6090 yen, so between

523
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:55,200
say $60 and $73 compared, well obviously it's a lot more expensive over there, I was going

524
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,840
to say, they're not going to be $70 games, they're not going to be $70 games here, but

525
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,040
they'll be more expensive than DS games won't they, they'll use the 3D thing as an excuse

526
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,760
to charge a $10 premium, they will, I've already said before that one of the launch titles

527
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:18,480
I've seen actually have an actual price to it is $40 retail, so it's not unheard of to

528
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,480
have a $40 retail DS game, but it's rare, so usually those are the Squeenix games right,

529
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,560
like the Final Fantasy remakes kind of got up there, sometimes, usually the cap they'll

530
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:38,880
do on DS games is about $35 retail, but there have been like one or two $40 retail games,

531
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,800
but I'm expecting probably a $10 increase, probably going to see everything from $40

532
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:53,560
to a $50 as a high end game would be my guess, and then of course there's some more information

533
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:59,160
regarding the battery life for the 3DS, they're saying that the 3DS has a 3 to 5 hour battery

534
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,560
life for playing 3DS games, of course it's going to be a little bit longer if you're

535
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,040
playing regular DS games, which is going to be 5 to 8 hours, and they're saying that's

536
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,640
probably because it doesn't have to run the third display since the two displays are interlaced

537
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:24,080
on the top screen, so that'll save a little bit of the battery, but either way, 5 to 8

538
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,760
hours or 3 to 5 hours, that's not too bad.

539
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:35,800
In comparison though, the DSi XL, they say that that lasts about 17 hours, so you may

540
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:42,320
have to charge it a little bit more than you would your normal systems.

541
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,200
So now that we know a little bit more about what the 3DS is going to be all about, I mean

542
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,560
granted a lot of this news that came out this week from the event was Japan, but still we're

543
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
kind of watching it here.

544
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:59,320
Well, Samurai Warriors Chronicles is coming out here, that'll be the launch title here,

545
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,560
Dead or Alive is going to be a launch title here, and Super Monkey Ball will be a launch

546
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
title.

547
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,720
So where's the hype at right now, because let me go to a comment in our chatroom at

548
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,400
chat.orangelaunchrader.com, Defective Candy in our chatroom says, I love Nintendo, but

549
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,080
I'm just not going to invest in a 3DS when it comes out.

550
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,240
I'm going to wait until they release a second version just to make sure all the bugs are

551
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
worked out.

552
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,640
And I think that's a good question to ask, where's the hype meter now for the 3DS?

553
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,600
Because are you guys interested in buying one now, or are you kind of where Defective

554
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,440
Candy's at, where you're like, you know what, there is always inevitably the GBA with the

555
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,840
backlight, the DS Lite, the second iteration of the handheld that comes out later.

556
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,680
Yeah, but here's the thing with me, and the DS Lite and all that stuff, I didn't really

557
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,680
care about the DS Lite.

558
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,920
I guess the only iteration would be like the DSi, that was slightly different where they

559
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:57,160
actually had like SD storage, and you know, the cameras on it and stuff like that.

560
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,240
That's a little different.

561
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,720
And I don't know if you'd even consider that like a different system almost, but it pretty

562
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,960
much was.

563
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,280
Sadly it won't ever be utilized, and remember they were going to be having DSi only games,

564
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,320
and there was a handful of those, but they were kind of crap.

565
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,840
A lot of them were crap, it was just unlock extra stuff that there's really no reason

566
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,200
we shut out of the regular DS version.

567
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Exactly.

568
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:29,800
So I don't know, I'm actually planning on getting one at launch, and really, you know,

569
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,680
they haven't announced any launch titles yet, but I know one of the titles that they were

570
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:38,840
working on that was supposed to be for the 3DS was the New Excite Truck Game, and I'm

571
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,600
telling you, if they have a New Excite Truck Game at launch, I will not be able to resist.

572
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,920
No, but I am planning on getting one at launch, and just because I don't really care about

573
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:55,240
the reiterations that come out later on, unless they add major features to them, it doesn't

574
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:01,040
really matter to me that they shrink down the size of the system, or they, you know,

575
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,880
make the system bigger, and they have a different color.

576
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,640
I don't care, because remember, those first systems are more exploitable than the other

577
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,800
systems, so that's really what I care about.

578
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:19,000
See here's where I'm at with the 3DS, like I am kind of with you skeptics, like it's

579
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,520
inevitable that once you buy this, they're going to announce a new one next year.

580
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,260
Like that is absolutely going to happen, it happens with every Apple product, it's a thing

581
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,400
of technology.

582
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,520
Here's and I'm really going to make myself sound like an a-hole by saying this, but here's

583
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,760
where I'm coming from that a lot of you aren't coming from.

584
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,760
I've seen the 3DS, and I've played the 3DS, and like I swear I'm not saying that to

585
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,400
be a jerk, but I'm telling you, I'm saying that because when you see this technology

586
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:55,720
for the first time, and you're like, I'm looking at 3D with no glasses, it kind of

587
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,720
takes you back for a minute.

588
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,520
And I think when they start putting these kiosks in stores and so forth, I think they're

589
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,880
going to win a lot of people over, and I think there's going to be a lot of people that

590
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,760
kind of put the, you know, oh well there'll be a new one next year aside, because they're

591
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,360
going to want something like this now.

592
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,560
Not just for the games, but for the things like the movies, and some of the other things

593
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,600
that they're promising they're going to do, the cameras and so forth.

594
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,200
I got to say, I really want one.

595
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,120
Here's the thing too about the 3DS, is it's really kind of pushing some technology here

596
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,560
that we don't see yet.

597
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,640
Nintendo does this.

598
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,080
They grasp new technology, and at the same time they don't embrace new technology sometimes.

599
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,000
With the Wii, the whole motion control thing, that was really ahead of the game there.

600
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,260
And then everybody was kind of playing catch up with that.

601
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,320
But their network support, not quite where it is with everybody else.

602
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,820
The 3DS, the technology's there, it's great that they're going to be doing all these cool

603
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,080
things with it.

604
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:56,140
I'm not so much of a fan of them re-releasing Nintendo 64 games supporting the 3DS.

605
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
Come on!

606
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:02,040
Seriously, you've been pulling this shit since the GameCube.

607
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,240
It's just ridiculous to have these re-release games, but whatever.

608
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,320
But here's the thing, is if this comes out and it's extremely popular, say they announce

609
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,960
the PSP2, okay great, the PSP2's going to have some pretty cool hardware behind it,

610
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,700
but what's it really going to do?

611
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,420
Has a trackpad on it, ooh, ooh, touchpad.

612
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,480
You're really catching up with everybody.

613
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,440
Well I don't want to sound like a broken record on this show, but I always think the PSP's

614
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,840
strength was not just as a gaming system, but as a comprehensive multimedia device.

615
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
They're really kind of expanding.

616
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,320
And that's what the 3DS doesn't have.

617
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,040
I don't look at the 3DS going, I'm going to be able to browse the web in 3D, no I'm not.

618
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,900
But they're saying though that, for example, they were talking at CES during their keynote

619
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,680
that they're having Sony tablets, they're having, well they didn't really come out and

620
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,880
say the PSP phone, but they're going to have the PSP phone.

621
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,400
They're going to have the PSP2 probably at some point soon.

622
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:05,240
So I don't think they really care too much, the fact that they can do all this stuff,

623
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,640
because pretty much everything now is doing all that stuff.

624
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,540
You can browse the web with any device almost.

625
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
Except the DS.

626
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,240
Uh huh, well I guess you can, and not very well.

627
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
Just not well.

628
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,680
Alright, let me go to the chatroom at chat.orangehelger.com, because there's some interesting discussion

629
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,120
going on here that I want to bring up.

630
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,420
Gamergirl kind of started the thing off by saying, I hate 3D, I can't watch that shit.

631
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:33,060
And SolarFlare says, 3D is a fad, and CSCR, SMAT 454, sorry I don't know what the preferred

632
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,480
name is there, wait for a price drop.

633
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Hmm.

634
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Well here's the thing.

635
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,640
Can I say this real quick though?

636
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,440
I also think, I'm getting a little sick of the whole 3Ds in the movie thing, because

637
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,600
I think most movies don't benefit from it.

638
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Tron sure did.

639
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,240
Yeah, but then I'm like, but Tron was actually really awesome in 3D.

640
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,640
I thought Avatar was great in 3D.

641
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,280
You know, and it's so difficult, like, I am, but I think there's too much, like Gulliver's

642
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,560
Travel's 3D, no thanks, not gonna bother, do not want, but even something like Tangled

643
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
was really cute.

644
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
But here's the thing though.

645
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,800
Gulliver's Travel is not a movie targeted at you Rob, it's targeted at little kids that

646
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
like Jack White.

647
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,200
Well it missed its target because it didn't do very well at the box office.

648
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,360
Well that's the thing, it's a gamble, I mean that's something, Jack Black does not put

649
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:28,000
people in the seats anymore, I don't know, but it's, speaking of which, I am gonna sneak

650
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:36,120
out to the theaters to see Tron one last time, in D-Box, in D-Box, because Friday the 14th

651
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,120
is the last day that they will have, actually no that will be the cutoff because they're

652
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:48,560
gonna be getting a new D-Box movie which is, what the fuck is it, it's that Seth Rogen

653
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
one.

654
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
The Green Lantern.

655
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
No, no, Green Hornet.

656
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Green Hornet, yeah.

657
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Green blank.

658
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
The Green Hornet.

659
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,800
Yes, I need to, I am sneaking out this week during, during, during.

660
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,600
Okay, here's the thing I want to say though, because I am totally in that camp where I

661
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,960
also think we're starting to get a little much with the 3D, and I was very skeptical

662
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,680
going into the 3DS, but seeing that technology for the first time without the glasses was

663
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,960
pretty amazing, and I have to admit my favorite part, and this is something the movies don't

664
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,520
give you, my favorite part was that there's a little slider where you can adjust the intensity

665
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:24,860
of the 3D, so it can be like, you know, kind of pulling on the eyes to, forget it, 2D.

666
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,960
Just throw the 3D out and have 2D.

667
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,720
So it's interesting to me that developers are gonna have to consider that, that some

668
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,280
people are gonna want to play 3D, and someone to play 2D.

669
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,440
The reason why I'm excited about the 3D, I want to see where it's gonna take games, because,

670
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,400
you know, things like Doom, Quake, even things like Zelda, when they first came out, they

671
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,040
were called 3D games.

672
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,000
This whole virtual reality.

673
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,040
And I think now that we have real 3D technology, I'm really curious to see where that's gonna

674
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,940
take the gaming and interaction technology.

675
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
That's where I'm at.

676
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,940
Sorry, Loki, I cut you off like five minutes.

677
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,400
Well, and then on the other thing is they don't have to necessarily use the 3DS top

678
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,680
screen as a 3D screen, they can use it as an HD 2D screen because you have twice the

679
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,160
resolution now to play around with.

680
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,160
They don't have to actually interlace it to do 3D.

681
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,400
So I think there's a lot of potential to do some really good-looking games, and the games

682
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,520
on it look really good.

683
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,520
I mean, like, the Dead or Live game looks like a console Dead or Live game, you know,

684
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,760
Street Fighter IV looks like console Street Fighter IV, so it's not bad.

685
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,460
And I think that's another point that a lot of people are forgetting is that we're all

686
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,560
talking about 3D, yes, but in 2D, the graphics are better than they are on the DS.

687
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,920
It is a graphical upgrade.

688
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,600
It's not just a DS recycled.

689
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,600
There is graphical and hardware upgrades with this thing.

690
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
So.

691
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,040
Well, we'll see.

692
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,840
I mean, you know, I'm curious to know more details about what the US is getting.

693
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,360
I was very surprised to hear that there is no pack-in at all.

694
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,520
And we haven't heard what the new Mario game's gonna be.

695
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,400
Can you imagine a new Mario game on this?

696
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,760
That'll be sexy.

697
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,080
I also do have to mention that for the people in the chat room who are pissing about, you

698
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,840
know, 3D, if you don't like it, don't see it.

699
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,800
Well, true, but, you know, I did ask the question, who's gonna buy this and who's not, and so

700
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
if they're not, that's fine.

701
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,880
Well, but I'm saying, you know, for the people who are just saying 3D is overdone, 3D is

702
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,960
overdone, if you don't like it, fine, don't ruin it for the people that like it.

703
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,400
I don't, you know, that's this thing.

704
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,960
If you don't want your games in 3D, don't buy a 3DS.

705
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,240
If you don't want your movies in 3D, don't go see them in 3D.

706
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,740
If you don't want to watch TV in 3D, don't get a 3D TV.

707
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,840
It's that easy.

708
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,640
Stop bitching.

709
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,640
But maybe there's this worry, and I think it's a valid concern, that 3D is slowly becoming

710
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,840
the norm.

711
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
You know?

712
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
It is gonna become the norm.

713
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Consumer electronics show.

714
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,140
We don't, we didn't hear about any 2D TVs.

715
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,880
Maybe the one, we heard about like one 2D TV because it was like a gigantic wall-sized

716
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,640
television, like, I mean, wall-sized television.

717
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,640
But otherwise, everybody's talking about 3D, 3D, 3D TVs, 3D TVs without glasses, 3D.

718
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,000
3D's not going anywhere.

719
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,400
It's gonna be around, you know, for a while, and it will become the norm, and people will

720
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,480
just stop bitching about it.

721
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
It's not a fad.

722
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,760
But yes, here, just like- So I can see where people are concerned about

723
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
that.

724
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,960
But just like any emerging technology, just like with, you know, the Wii and stuff like

725
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,760
that, the first, you know, the first games you have on the Wii or whatever are gonna

726
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,880
be really cheesy, and they're gonna be just some cheap ideas to utilize the technology.

727
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,240
Just like the first 3D movies, you know, there's a couple good ones, and a lot of them were

728
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,080
just tacked on 3D to get people in the seats because it's a 3D movie.

729
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,480
But a lot of stuff now, a lot of movies are being filmed in 3D.

730
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,240
Granted, you're not gonna see, you know, I don't know, Sister of the Traveling Pants

731
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
3 in 3D.

732
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,680
God, let's hope not.

733
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,680
You know, but I think eventually everything will be in 3D, and that's just gonna be the

734
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
way it is.

735
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,520
You know, and when your kids, you know, you're talking to your kids about how you used to

736
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,360
see the 2D movies, they're like, 2D?

737
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,080
What are you talking about?

738
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,080
What is 2D?

739
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,280
And that's the time when the 4D dimension will be coming out, and you can watch movies

740
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,460
in an alternate time.

741
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:18,320
This is my issue, is that people bitched about TV when it was new.

742
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,640
People bitched about HDTV.

743
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,480
People bitched when it was time to go from 8-track to cassette.

744
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,040
Or VHS to DVD.

745
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Exactly.

746
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,200
It's the same thing over and over.

747
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,160
And it's just sort of like a big inevitability.

748
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,880
Technology is going to progress.

749
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,280
I gotta play devil's advocate.

750
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,240
None of those technologies hurt my eyes.

751
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,280
That's the one downside I can see to this 3D.

752
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Yeah.

753
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,720
Like, even when I go to do the 3D movies and so forth, like, I can't wear the glasses for

754
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
the whole two hours consecutively.

755
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Yeah, but you know why, though?

756
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,280
That's because the technology that they have right now, there's a lot of flicker and just

757
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,900
they're gonna catch up.

758
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,120
It's the technology will get better and it'll be less harsh on your eyes.

759
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
Okay, that's fair.

760
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
Well, think about this.

761
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,720
Alright, look at televisions in the 80s.

762
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Okay.

763
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,040
Remember those big, you know, cabinet televisions that would have that, you know, look like,

764
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,240
oh, there's supposed to be nice furniture and shit.

765
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,200
Really blurry screen quality.

766
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,840
Now we've got TVs that are three times those size in perfect crystal clear HD quality.

767
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,200
And we're talking about a span of 25 years.

768
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,280
So by the time I'm 50, the holodeck should be out, right?

769
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,660
No, I'm not saying that.

770
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,660
But now also...

771
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,660
Holodeck retirement.

772
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:38,680
But now, but if you think about it too, the growth of technology is also exponential,

773
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:47,040
you know, as the more technological advancement you get in the different fields, they're gonna

774
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,140
speed up the new rate of research.

775
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,240
The more you learn, the more you're gonna learn.

776
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,560
That's how I see it.

777
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,160
Two very interesting comments in chat.

778
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
I gotta bring up.

779
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,680
Bochi Kawa in our chat room says, besides, we're still playing games on the NES.

780
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,120
If you want new, then get new.

781
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,000
If you want old, play old.

782
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Interesting.

783
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Seriously.

784
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And that's what we do.

785
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,960
We've got a whole room full of old.

786
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,240
And it's not to say that all technologies end up, you know, taking off.

787
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
Old is new.

788
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,520
Look at how much retro crap gets repackaged and comes out.

789
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
You know what I mean?

790
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,000
That's because all the kids have grown up and are making the games.

791
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Fascinating.

792
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Steve, and I don't know if this is our show or not, but can you believe that copies of

793
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:34,400
Super Mario All-Stars, the reprint that was on the Wii, are selling for $75 and $80 on

794
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
eBay?

795
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
Yeah.

796
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,700
Are you people fucking nuts?

797
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,240
Let me bring this up in chat as well, because this is another good comment.

798
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,680
And then I promise we can change the topic.

799
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,060
Mayor in our chat room says, why now versus the last 3D?

800
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,000
And I think that's a very legitimate question.

801
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,160
And I'm guessing a lot of it has to do with the technology.

802
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:00,120
Like, you know, the last time 3D was big was the mid early 80s when like Jaws 3D was out

803
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,400
and that stuff.

804
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,800
And I'm thinking there's two reasons for it.

805
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,240
A, that technology wasn't as good, period.

806
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,760
I mean, when you're talking to 3DS, again, I'm telling you guys, the first time you see

807
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,680
it without glasses, you do have that moment of, whoa, everybody's going to have that moment

808
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,380
of whoa, I'm playing this and I'm not wearing glasses and I'm seeing the 3D.

809
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,680
And then B, Jaws 3D was not Avatar.

810
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,020
And love Avatar or hate it, the fact is it's the highest grossing movie ever.

811
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,600
And now everybody wants to be it.

812
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,560
So I think those are the two big differences to me is that, you know, technology has come

813
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,460
a long way and a movie got to be extremely successful with the technology.

814
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,840
And let me tell you that Avatar didn't make its money because people liked the plot.

815
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,440
They wanted to see the pretty 3D.

816
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,760
Well, but if you also look into the actual technology that went into it, it's basically

817
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,920
in, you know, I think that they applied some of it to a lesser extent in Tron, remember,

818
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,400
with the having the 3D modeled younger face, even though he looked like, you know, plastic.

819
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,080
That technology still needs, still needs some work.

820
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,160
But I think I think what they needed was better animation.

821
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,640
That's what I think that that needed.

822
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,560
But if you stop and look at it, you're going to basically be replacing.

823
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,800
I mean, now, keep in mind, we were having this conversation like a while back, me and

824
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,680
Dan were, about how we miss, you know, matte paintings and, you know, things in movies

825
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,920
use like, for example, OK, I'll use Tron since I was already on it.

826
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,800
In the first Tron movie, when he walks into the cubicle area and there's cubicles going

827
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,840
on for miles, that was all matte painting.

828
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:51,400
You know, or remember V when they walked into the ship and it's, you know, the whole lines

829
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,880
of the storage pods going on in the back and the old one.

830
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,160
That was all matte painting.

831
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,520
My favorite was always rear projection for driving scenes.

832
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
Yeah.

833
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:07,200
But now, but now if you look at that, you're going to, I don't think that the craftsmanship

834
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,520
is going anywhere.

835
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,880
It's just moving to a different medium.

836
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,400
You're still going to have to have animators.

837
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,680
You're still going to have to have artists that are going to be able to make all of this.

838
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,480
And yeah, maybe you're saving in resources in paint and that type of thing.

839
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,720
And keep in mind, I still think nothing will replace painting.

840
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,160
Nothing will replace physical art.

841
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
You know what I mean?

842
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,760
But at the same time, I think that if you're looking in terms of pushing the envelope as

843
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,920
far as the experience that you can deliver in technology, in a cinematic experience or

844
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,360
in games or movies, anything like that, that you're going to have to start making situations

845
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,320
where it's cheaper to produce.

846
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:52,280
And I think that that's going to be the advantage of going with the same type of innovations

847
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
that they made with Avatar.

848
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,320
That's what my point was, is the fact that you could have warehouses and then send it

849
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:06,680
off to a team of animators and have this high quality product produced with some time and

850
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,820
effort, but you're not paying for a set.

851
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:14,480
You're not paying for makeup, you know, none of that.

852
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,480
That was my point.

853
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,480
Okay.

854
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,480
Okay.

855
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,840
That's where I see everything going with the technology developed with that.

856
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,980
You know, yeah, cool movie.

857
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,800
But I think that they need to take the same things that, you know, they can even do, keep

858
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,040
in mind, they can even do the same thing with video games.

859
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,880
You know, we've had motion capture in video games before, so keep in mind taking that

860
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,560
same sort of, you know, the blank set.

861
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:43,520
You can actually do all of your cinematic cut scenes with like actual actors and record

862
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,440
them real time, have them, you know, the layers and everything, but over it for a game and

863
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,800
boom, there you go.

864
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,280
Let me try to wrap up this topic by going back to one of the thought.

865
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,240
No, because it relates to what you just said about motion capture and stuff and a lot of

866
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,200
the other technology that's been coming out in the past few months has to do with that

867
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:06,120
when you talk about Kinect is basically kind of like a live motion capture type of thing.

868
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,440
Going back to the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are

869
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,440
on it.

870
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,600
And I think that's very important to remember with this whole 3DS launch as well is that

871
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:19,000
if the games are poop, you know, the pretty will wear off quickly.

872
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,220
I am really curious about this year's E3.

873
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,700
I am so, like I have to admit, like the hype going into this year's E3 is almost higher

874
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:32,600
than it's ever been because I think this is a very crucial E3.

875
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:38,160
I think it's either going to be the best show ever or it's going to be a stinker.

876
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,200
And I mean, easy to say, right?

877
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,760
But the reason why is because now you have this technology, you have Kinect, you have

878
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,840
Move, you have soon to be this PSP2, and you have the 3DS and, you know, all these launch

879
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,460
games are kind of like that obvious thing to do the technology.

880
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,960
All the Kinect launch games were essentially Wii knockoffs and Dance Central.

881
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,600
You know, all the 3DS things are these Nintendo upgrades and sort of like, you know, finally

882
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,120
Kid Icarus coming back and so forth.

883
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,280
I'm really curious now what is going to be next.

884
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,120
Now that these technologies are established, how are you going to take it to the next level?

885
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,120
What is that must-have game going to have in it that implements that technology that

886
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,360
just blows us away?

887
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,800
So I'm really interested in what's going to be brought to the table this year at E3.

888
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,000
And it's either going to be great or it's going to show that, you know what, we should

889
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,040
have never left where we were last year.

890
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:44,000
The whole 12 months have been a lie, and this whole crap is just a fad.

891
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Very curious.

892
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,960
Anyhow, let's move on with some more topics.

893
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,960
Good discussion, but we've got plenty more to get through tonight.

894
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,960
So Dark Sakura.

895
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,360
Well, how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with 3D visuals except maybe

896
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,360
being rendered?

897
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,920
Lord of the Rings Online.

898
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,280
It's making a lot of money now.

899
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,320
Since they went free to play, and you know how we kind of left, oh, they must be sucking,

900
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,800
they're going free to play.

901
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:13,160
Actually, they're making three times as much revenue monthly, so that's pretty cool.

902
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:19,300
They are now doing the whole, I hate the word term, microtransaction, because a transaction

903
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:27,480
is a transaction, fuck putting a size on it, but they're using this little, you know, and

904
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,160
I can see doing it, I've been doing some of them in Star Trek Online when I was playing.

905
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,120
I bought outfits and ship packs and stuff, even with my subscription fee.

906
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:43,560
So I can see that if someone wants to make a character look a certain way, they're going

907
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,800
to spend all the little bits and pieces and not even see that they're nickel diming their

908
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,000
money right into their pocket.

909
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,800
And I've always said the minute this technology comes out for World of Warcraft, Horde House

910
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,960
is over, I'm quitting WoW.

911
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,760
The minute this type of stuff, and you might already say, oh Rob, you can already do it,

912
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,560
the mounts are da da da da, that's all superficial crap, and you know, it does not affect the

913
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
base game.

914
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
When this becomes their model.

915
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,560
Exactly.

916
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,400
If Warcraft ever implements this stuff where the stats, you know, change or you're getting

917
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,320
things that otherwise you grind dungeons for or whatever, Horde House is canceled and WoW

918
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:23,520
is done, as far as I'm concerned, because that's not, I like playing a game where everybody's

919
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,080
on an equal playing field.

920
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,480
Everybody's paying 15 bucks a month, everybody, you know, is on that same playing field when

921
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,240
it comes to the quest that you're grinding and so forth, and those that get the super

922
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,680
awesome items really worked for it.

923
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:45,240
However, that's not to slam this other idea, because, you know, not everything can be WoW,

924
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,740
and not everything can kind of command the $15 up front, and I think we've seen a lot

925
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:55,700
of the same model, oddly enough, in Facebook games, and it's worked really well.

926
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,880
You know, and I don't know, these games, I'm okay with the way they do it, because it's

927
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,560
sort of like, well you know nothing in this world is really free.

928
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,200
So that's how they choose to nickel and dime you instead of the cost of the game.

929
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,560
And so, I don't know, for some reason, I'm okay with it, but at the same time, I can't

930
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:17,640
think of any free to play games that I really play with any regularity, except one or two

931
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,300
Facebook games.

932
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,400
That even then, if they were to disappear and delete tomorrow, I wouldn't lose any sleep

933
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
over it.

934
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,240
Well, you keep in mind, too, that a lot of, like, remember when I was playing Ragnarok

935
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,240
Online?

936
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,640
A lot of the free servers that I would play on, they would actually make the money to

937
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,840
run the servers by offering special items for people who donated.

938
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,120
And that's been going on for years.

939
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,960
Second Life, that's how they run.

940
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,480
You know, you pay real money for stuff that people have made, and that's how you do your

941
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,080
thing there.

942
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:57,120
I think that it's just now they're saying that, you know, when you don't notice how

943
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:03,400
much you're spending, that it's easier to spend a lot more, if that makes sense.

944
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,400
Absolutely.

945
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,000
That's gambling, is a lot of that.

946
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,280
And on top of that, you're not dealing with actual physical money.

947
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,560
You're dealing with a click, yes.

948
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,440
There's no money leaving your hand, but it's relieving your bank account, so.

949
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,440
It could be dangerous.

950
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,440
When Xbox Live first came out, I bought every single arcade game that came out.

951
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,440
Freakin' iTunes.

952
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,240
Yeah, iTunes is easy to fall into that too.

953
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,240
Same thing.

954
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,240
Oh yeah.

955
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,240
So, anyway.

956
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,920
Good talks tonight!

957
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,920
Speaking of Xbox Live-

958
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,400
Keep a ledger by your desk when you play.

959
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,400
For real.

960
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,360
Alright, Loki, what's up next in the news for us?

961
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,360
Alright.

962
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,360
Oops.

963
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,360
Anyways.

964
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:48,520
This is kinda cool, they're doing a new promotion, it's kinda something that they've been doing

965
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,120
each year for Xbox Live Arcade.

966
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,120
The House Party.

967
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,880
Well, this time they've got a lineup of games coming out that's actually pretty cool.

968
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,320
There's gonna be five games that will start coming out on February 18th, each week.

969
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,600
And it's gonna include the following titles.

970
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:12,960
Beyond Good and Evil HD, Hardcore Uprising, that's that Contra game that's kinda anime

971
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,960
style now.

972
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:20,480
Bejeweled Blitz Live, Full House Poker, which is supposed to be that game that's kind of

973
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:26,920
the next evolution of the, what do they call that, the 1 vs 100 type thing, but now with

974
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,920
poker.

975
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,680
And then of course, Torchlight is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade as well.

976
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,600
So that's a pretty good lineup of titles right there.

977
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:45,880
And no word on pricing for that yet, but those are gonna be each week, so that's pretty exciting.

978
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,520
I am so excited about Torchlight coming.

979
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,520
It's gonna be sweet.

980
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,480
But it's gonna be weird, because Torchlight is very PC.

981
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,480
You know what I mean?

982
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,040
And if you've never played it, it's basically Diablo 2.

983
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,020
I don't know how else to explain it.

984
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:09,840
It's a lot of that same kind of like dungeon crawl, and lots of keys do different things.

985
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,040
And I think they've talked about with this coming to Xbox Live Arcade, they've practically

986
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,720
revamped the whole battle system, because you kinda have to click a lot.

987
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,240
You have to use a mouse to play Torchlight.

988
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,480
So going from that to controller is gonna be really weird.

989
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,840
It's not even gonna be the same game.

990
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,600
So it's almost strange to me that they're calling it Torchlight still.

991
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,240
It's almost like Torchlight Side Quest or Side Story.

992
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,500
I guess I don't really know until I get my hands on it how different it's gonna be, but

993
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:44,920
just at the base with changing all these controls is gonna be really interesting.

994
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,880
But at the same time, they're gonna kinda trick me into buying the same game twice,

995
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,600
because I have it on PC and now I kinda want it on Xbox Live Arcade.

996
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,600
Damn it!

997
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,600
Damn it!

998
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,600
Exactly.

999
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,600
I've been tricked into buying this game twice.

1000
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,160
What about you, chatters?

1001
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,240
Many of you guys play Torchlight on your PC, and yet you think you're gonna buy this on

1002
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,000
Xbox Live Arcade as well?

1003
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So I'm curious about...

1004
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,600
What were some of the other games that were coming out?

1005
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,640
It's all Torchlight Torchlight to me.

1006
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,680
But Joel Blitz Live, they have that...

1007
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,280
That game's free to play on Facebook.

1008
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,480
They're gonna charge me to play it on Xbox Live?

1009
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,480
Yeah.

1010
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,480
Bastards.

1011
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,480
Beyond Good and Evil HD.

1012
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,000
I know a lot of people are Beyond Good and Evil fans.

1013
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yeah, that'll be a big one.

1014
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,320
What else?

1015
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,520
Oh, there's that new poker game that was from Microsoft.

1016
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:35,360
Oh, that's the 1 versus 100 replacement, isn't it?

1017
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,360
Yes.

1018
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,200
Bochikawa in our chatroom says Torchlight with Kinect support?

1019
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,680
That might be really fun.

1020
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,840
I don't think it uses Kinect.

1021
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,840
I don't think so either.

1022
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,360
That's an interesting thought, though, is that what if instead of a mouse, it was your

1023
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,360
hand?

1024
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,780
And you could just move your hand around and click by, like, just thrusting your hand forward

1025
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,780
or something?

1026
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,780
I don't know.

1027
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,780
It'd be interesting.

1028
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,720
Did Suya remind us that Diablo was on the PlayStation?

1029
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,960
Look at how Diablo worked on the PlayStation.

1030
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,160
They just changed the controls to work with the controller.

1031
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,480
I totally forgot that Diablo had been on the PlayStation.

1032
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,000
I think I did play it on the PlayStation, too.

1033
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
All right.

1034
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,440
Well, anyhow, moving on to another story while some more comments come in.

1035
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,440
This is one of those stories.

1036
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,160
I just want to hurry up and get through this and forget about it because it's another one

1037
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,880
of these, like, crazy obscure patent guy comes out and decides to sue reputable companies

1038
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,760
in a court of law because everybody in this country is too happy.

1039
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,160
And who's getting sued this time?

1040
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,880
Activision Blizzard and Zynga.

1041
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,900
And I can't, like, what do these two companies possibly have in common where they're both

1042
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,900
being sued?

1043
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:44,480
Well, Walker Digital, which was founded by Jay Walker, who also made Priceline.com, is

1044
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,480
behind this suit.

1045
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,060
So maybe it's not just any old troll.

1046
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,720
This is a troll with a big website.

1047
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:56,800
Zynga and Activision violate the patent, which is a database-driven online distributed

1048
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,920
tournament system.

1049
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:06,000
Walker is saying that the part of this that has been violated is the part of the patent

1050
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,200
that says there is a, quote, method of conducting a distributed electronic tournament for a

1051
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,160
plurality of players.

1052
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,640
And World of Warcraft Call of Duty Black Ops, which is Activision, which is part of Blizzard

1053
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,680
Card, Mafia Wars, and all these games have these tournaments in them.

1054
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,760
Kind of odd that Starcraft isn't mentioned, because when I think tournaments, I don't

1055
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,360
think, wow, I think Starcraft, but whatever.

1056
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,600
I guess violates this patent.

1057
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:39,880
I don't know, I'm starting to think with all these stories I read that patent stuff is

1058
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,480
a need for reform, or-

1059
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,280
I think whatever judge reviews that needs to just tell him to bite his ass.

1060
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,520
Well, and it probably will get laughed out of court, as a lot of these recent ones have,

1061
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,800
but they're asking for a full trial or whatever.

1062
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,800
And you know what?

1063
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,760
If this guy had the technology years ago or whatever, that's fine.

1064
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,440
If you were the one that thought of it, I guess, although I somehow don't think these

1065
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,440
companies have implemented it quite the same way.

1066
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,600
And just the fact that, why do you patent something and then do nothing with it?

1067
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,120
Like that's what bothers.

1068
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,240
That's what makes you look like a troll, is you're just waiting for someone to actually

1069
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,680
put a good idea to use, and then it gets to the pants off of them.

1070
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,680
I don't know.

1071
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,640
A little silly to me, and I'm sure it's a little silly to all of you as well.

1072
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,440
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?

1073
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,440
Oh, I've got a few other things.

1074
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,440
How about Mario All-Stars?

1075
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:35,120
Well, it's sold out, and copies are going for 80 bucks on eBay, and they're talking

1076
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,120
about more reprints.

1077
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,220
So we might be seeing it going, however, they have not sold out in the UK.

1078
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:47,440
And you can still get your copy on Amazon UK for $17.99.

1079
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,960
So people in Europe, stockpile!

1080
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,800
Because we're coming after your supply.

1081
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,760
And people here in the US, you're gonna be really sorry buying these for $80 on eBay

1082
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,920
if they end up reprinting them, which they probably will.

1083
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:08,200
Well yeah, I mean, basically, Mark Franklin, who's the head of Nintendo PR, said that they're

1084
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,960
thinking about bringing it back in reprints.

1085
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,040
So they definitely want to make more money, and people will buy them.

1086
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,900
The market's there.

1087
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,120
And I'm sure there's gotta be a lot of us sitting here going, who is buying this?

1088
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:27,440
Because seriously, it's a port of a game that was out on the SNES, I mean.

1089
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,520
Well here's this, Dan turned to me a while back and said, hey, you want this game?

1090
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,520
Why?

1091
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,520
We've got it on the SNES.

1092
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,680
I mean, I think we were talking about wanting the special edition or something because it

1093
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,360
came with shit, but why?

1094
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,120
I'll tell you who's buying this.

1095
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,120
Most people out there in the world aren't like you and Dan.

1096
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,220
There's a lot of folks that, you know, are having families now that when they were teenagers

1097
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,860
were playing the Super Nintendo and remember this game on the Super Nintendo.

1098
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,080
It's soccer moms!

1099
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,660
It's the same people that are driving the sales of the Wii in the first place.

1100
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,280
Soccer moms are buying the Mario games because they remember playing it when they were younger.

1101
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,160
I guarantee that you can buy a Super Nintendo and the game for less than $80.

1102
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,360
Oh no, I'm sure you can.

1103
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,000
The game is easy to find.

1104
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,440
I mean, it wasn't like a super limited production or anything, but you can find them.

1105
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,160
Most people don't understand that.

1106
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,160
I think I've got two copies.

1107
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,160
They think it's the Wii.

1108
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,120
If I have another copy I'll send it to somebody.

1109
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:28,960
I know this is hard for people that listen to this show to understand because you all

1110
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,680
are very gaming aware, you're culturally aware of the gaming community.

1111
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,780
I think there's a lot of people out there that honestly don't understand that.

1112
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,640
They don't think you can buy Super Nintendos anymore or they think that, well, it's on

1113
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,640
the Wii.

1114
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,640
It's a Wii version.

1115
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,640
It's different.

1116
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,200
No, it's not.

1117
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,280
They don't know that.

1118
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,380
All they know is that the game is on the Wii now.

1119
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:53,200
We are expert analysts of video games.

1120
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,560
Trust us.

1121
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,560
It's the same thing.

1122
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:00,040
It's like when they re-release The Wizard of Oz into theaters for a limited run.

1123
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,480
It's the same damn movie.

1124
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,080
They didn't put anything back.

1125
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,000
Dorothy suddenly does not go home.

1126
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
You know what I mean?

1127
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
She still clicks her heels three times.

1128
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
That'd be fucking hilarious.

1129
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
They changed the ending.

1130
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
But no, the movie is still the same.

1131
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
You know what I mean?

1132
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Nothing's changed.

1133
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,720
But a lot of people don't get that.

1134
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,720
I honestly truly think-

1135
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,940
It changed the ending and she's actually in the Insane Asylum like in the second movie.

1136
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:26,200
I honestly truly think people don't know that you can go out and still buy the game.

1137
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:30,640
They think that, oh, they've re-released this now and I can get it on my Wii for my kids.

1138
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,320
They should be listening to our podcast.

1139
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,040
Why aren't they?

1140
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,040
And some folks in the chat room seem to agree with me.

1141
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,520
Tiger Claw says true.

1142
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,540
And people who never bought a Mario game in their life, this will be their first entry

1143
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,540
to Mario.

1144
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:46,100
DDR Dollar Bill says, here's the thing, casual players aren't going to go out and find a

1145
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,820
Super Nintendo and then find the games.

1146
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,440
They don't know how to hunt at a free market.

1147
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,440
Lazy.

1148
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,440
I know.

1149
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,960
They're taking advantage of lazy people.

1150
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,200
Every industry out there takes advantage of people being lazy.

1151
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,240
We have certain infomercials exist.

1152
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:09,040
They create problems for people that people didn't have before so that they can sell them

1153
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,760
a product for something, for a problem they didn't have.

1154
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,800
Thank you for reminding me because I actually have a problem with my cat not being able

1155
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:20,220
to get high enough on our windows so I had to go buy a Sunny Seat for it.

1156
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,220
Your cat can live.

1157
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,340
It's a cat.

1158
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,360
She needs to be higher up on the window.

1159
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,320
Shirmi sits on the damn floor.

1160
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,320
Cats desire height.

1161
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,320
When she wants sunlight, she goes and sits in front of the door.

1162
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:35,240
I think some of the greatest company ideas out there are formed on how can I allow people

1163
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,240
to be more lazy.

1164
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,680
Like, let me give you an example.

1165
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:42,000
There's companies out there that will do takeout for any type of food and they just charge

1166
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
like a surcharge over it.

1167
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,440
We have something called takeout taxi.

1168
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,120
Yeah, any restaurant in the world can get you takeout food.

1169
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,680
Now here's the thing.

1170
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:54,400
Not everybody who uses that is lazy because certainly you have homebound people, sick

1171
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,800
people, people who don't have driver's license.

1172
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,800
People who are studying for their finals.

1173
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,800
Yeah, exactly.

1174
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,160
But I'll bet you that's 10% of who's using it.

1175
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,160
Oh yeah.

1176
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,000
No, I understand.

1177
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,200
It's just, you know, what, I don't want to start ranting again.

1178
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,200
Forget it.

1179
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,200
No.

1180
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,200
Please rant.

1181
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,200
We haven't had good rants in a long time on this show.

1182
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:21,800
Why can't people just get off their asses and just put effort into shit, you know?

1183
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,440
Because then I have to look away from my farm and my plants on my Farmville will die.

1184
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,080
I was just ranting, Rob.

1185
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:36,240
It's like, nothing is going to equal the experience of sitting down and playing the game on the

1186
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,280
Super Nintendo with the right controller.

1187
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,320
It's just not going to be the same.

1188
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,880
And I mean, like, you know, that's the whole reason why we didn't get the new Donkey Kong,

1189
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,880
Rob?

1190
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,480
It's because you can't play it with a classic controller.

1191
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,680
It's not Donkey Kong.

1192
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,920
Oh wow.

1193
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,060
You have to do the little shaky thing.

1194
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:55,640
They didn't want to put motion control in it.

1195
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,520
Miyamoto made them.

1196
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,240
That's retarded.

1197
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,240
I want to sit down and play a game that doesn't have motion control and I want to wear my

1198
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:10,040
pajamas while I'm doing it so I can be lazy playing it the way it's meant to be played.

1199
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,140
So I'll go to effort to be lazy.

1200
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:16,440
You know what's a really interesting comment here from XLink in our chat room?

1201
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,620
Netflix is another company.

1202
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:22,320
And I'm not, he didn't really put context to that so I'm assuming it means, like, Netflix

1203
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,140
kind of made their money off lazy things.

1204
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:29,760
But I don't know, like, I can definitely see that end of it but I don't know if I'd necessarily

1205
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,600
call it lazy as much as it is damn convenient.

1206
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,480
You know, because what did we have to do before?

1207
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,080
You had to get out, get in your car, go to the video store and so forth.

1208
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,160
It's just, it's more convenience in my opinion.

1209
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,680
It's also kind of the subscriber fee.

1210
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,320
You know, when Blockbuster had their stores, not until the end after Netflix was out did

1211
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,920
they have these monthly fees where you could rent all the movies you wanted.

1212
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,800
Like I always, like that's why people like Netflix from what I understood was that, you

1213
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,680
know, they could send one movie away and there'd be another one waiting for them and it's kind

1214
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:05,120
of like, you know, I don't, I can kind of take that going to Blockbuster out of my daily

1215
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,040
routine and watch more movies.

1216
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,360
I don't know if I would call that lazy though.

1217
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,280
I mean, I guess it is in a way.

1218
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:17,040
Yeah, it's, people are convenience centric.

1219
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:24,320
They're focused on convenience and, you know, I kind of miss, you know, going to Blockbuster

1220
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,120
and looking at the movies and reading the backs of them and everything and going to

1221
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,480
rent my games and the special rental only versions of stuff.

1222
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,280
Well there's still like one Blockbuster in every town if you want to do that.

1223
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,440
It's just farther away now.

1224
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,840
And the fucking red box thing.

1225
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,840
I hate the red box.

1226
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:48,080
That's why my husband doesn't have a job as a freaking red box.

1227
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,080
Hate it.

1228
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,880
I'm not really a big fan of red box either.

1229
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:57,160
Like in my opinion, you should go out to the, like you should go out to a Blockbuster if

1230
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,360
you're going to use something like red box.

1231
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,720
It's not that different.

1232
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,240
And this is what the other problem is too is that I think that there's a sort of forced

1233
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,040
isolation going on people.

1234
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:11,040
You know, it used to be you had to get out and be in society and be a part of things,

1235
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:17,280
but now it's like everyone's an individual and we have to cater to everybody and political

1236
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,120
correct and blah, blah, blah.

1237
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:24,600
And I think that it's a matter of you're removing the human element from the equation.

1238
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,080
Ooh, good point from Frisbee in our chat room.

1239
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,040
Netflix eliminated the late fees.

1240
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,480
That's why it got so popular.

1241
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,480
That's a very good point.

1242
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,800
But, but do you see what I do?

1243
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:34,800
I do.

1244
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,800
I do.

1245
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,840
I have to make sure our chatters, every gamer has a voice.

1246
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:43,720
For example, even with world of Warcraft, going back to that, you're, you're not really

1247
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:49,380
there hanging out with your people, you know, you're chatting and yeah, but it's impersonal.

1248
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,440
It's pretty impersonal I think.

1249
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,560
And what happened to getting people together and playing a board game or getting people

1250
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:58,280
over for, you know, doing four player bomber man?

1251
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:02,320
See, I like to do both, but sometimes it's not practical.

1252
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,320
You know what I mean?

1253
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,540
Like sometimes I'm playing these games with people that live halfway across the country

1254
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,640
or all the way across the country.

1255
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,640
That's fine.

1256
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,640
That's one thing.

1257
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,080
But I'm saying how many people in the guild live in town or near town?

1258
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:17,720
I mean that, that's, you know, one point you, it used to be that we would, all of us would

1259
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,520
get together like twice a week and play DDR or go to the arcade and something and now

1260
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,720
it's just like, Oh, I'll see you online.

1261
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,720
What happened to hanging out?

1262
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:28,480
What happened to good old fashioned hanging out?

1263
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,280
It's I think that the other thing with, with, you know, all of this is just that it's removing

1264
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,560
the personal element from everything.

1265
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:38,440
We are a convenience driven society and we also don't like dealing with people because

1266
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,400
it's inconvenient to, anyway, more ranting.

1267
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:48,600
Yet, yet there's a stigma in our society that we all need to be skinny and beautiful because

1268
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,640
only skinny is beautiful.

1269
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:57,440
But the realistic end of it is that with how much we are lazy and convenience driven, it

1270
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:04,800
ought to be that like, you know, sitting at home all day getting really, really, you know,

1271
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,840
nonactive and stuff ought to be the pretty thing, right?

1272
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,400
Cause that's where more people are at these days.

1273
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,400
I don't know.

1274
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,280
So what you're saying is like back in the middle ages.

1275
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,280
Sure.

1276
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:23,760
Cause if you know, you were fair skinned and stuff and nonworking, then you were more desirable.

1277
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,960
I would be so famous in the middle ages.

1278
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,240
All right.

1279
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,080
We're totally getting on this like off topic.

1280
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,360
Remember when big butts were in?

1281
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,120
You have that magnet.

1282
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,280
I like big butts and I cannot lie.

1283
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,280
You either brothers can't deny.

1284
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,280
I thought you liked boobs.

1285
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,520
All right, let's move on.

1286
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,520
Release dates.

1287
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,880
Let's travel around the world and see what is conveniently coming out to a store near

1288
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,880
you.

1289
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,880
Yes.

1290
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,160
Not a whole lot this week yet, but there are a few things coming out, so that's good.

1291
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:59,040
The start of things off, Venetica, which is on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

1292
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,400
Ghost Trick Phantom Detective on Nintendo DS.

1293
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,000
That's by the artwork from the guys that did stuff on the Ace Attorney series.

1294
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,760
So that looks pretty cool.

1295
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,320
DC Universe.

1296
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:15,360
They're going to have that available on PlayStation 3 and PC, both the regular and collector's

1297
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,680
editions of those.

1298
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:22,280
Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude, on PSP.

1299
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,280
What?

1300
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,600
Say that again.

1301
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:30,800
Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.

1302
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:35,120
Prinny's are the little guys in the Disgaea, little penguin dudes, right?

1303
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,120
Yes.

1304
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,760
And this is about Operation Panties?

1305
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,760
Yes.

1306
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,640
Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.

1307
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,440
Okay, like, what the fuck happened to this series when I wasn't watching it?

1308
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,760
So, like, now there's a game coming out where the little penguins are going on a panty raid.

1309
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,280
Am I correct?

1310
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,960
I'm not sure.

1311
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,720
What is Operation Panties?

1312
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,280
I have no idea.

1313
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,200
Alright, keep going.

1314
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,880
I need to do some research.

1315
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,560
Kingdom Hearts Re-Coded.

1316
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,760
That's coming out on Nintendo DS this week.

1317
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:14,320
Um, Spell Force 2, Faith and Destiny on PC.

1318
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:21,280
Um, let's see.

1319
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,640
And that's basically it.

1320
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,640
Next week, lots of good stuff.

1321
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,480
But that's for next week's, or the week after next, I should say.

1322
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,240
I want me some Little Big Planet 2.

1323
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,200
There's no wiki entry on Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.

1324
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,480
I'm trying to find more information on this.

1325
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:40,480
I'm doing Google.

1326
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,920
Give me a minute.

1327
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,920
Let's see.

1328
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,080
Okay, there's something on the PlayStation blog.

1329
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,880
Let's see what this is all about.

1330
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:52,680
Prinny 2 is a side-scrolling hack and slash action game and you can play as Prinny.

1331
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:57,080
Your mission this time is to find the precious panties of demon lord Etna.

1332
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:02,440
Yes, you have to search for Etna's panties, or Etna swears that she will skin all Prinny's

1333
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,240
and make them into panties.

1334
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:09,800
Well now that I think of that, Prinny panties would be kind of cool, but not for the Prinny's.

1335
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:15,040
You must find her panties by following morning in the game so you don't have any time to

1336
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,040
dilly dally.

1337
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:21,320
Let's get to it, dude.

1338
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,880
Words escape me, folks.

1339
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,760
This is what gaming has become.

1340
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,760
Look at your life.

1341
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,760
Look at your choices.

1342
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:33,880
What, what, what are you doing?

1343
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:39,960
Insolacious pop is, is chiming in there.

1344
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,120
Etna, the demon girl was in Disgaea.

1345
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,240
Her panties are missing and you fight an action platformer to find them, but with panties

1346
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:52,160
like in ghosts and goblins, those ghosts and goblins and panties.

1347
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:57,040
I just, I can't.

1348
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,600
Although you know what, this game probably deserves to sell more copies than a lot of

1349
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,600
the stuff out there.

1350
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,720
I mean, hooray for them for giving gamers what they really want.

1351
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,720
Panties.

1352
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:11,440
Let's move on to Japan and talk about some of the crazy games coming out over there.

1353
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,400
On the Xbox 360, Arcana Heart 3 is making its way out this week.

1354
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,040
Arcana Heart, that's the all chick fighters, right?

1355
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,040
Yeah.

1356
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,740
Alright, number 3 is coming out.

1357
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,040
Panties will fly.

1358
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,340
Or at least they will in my brain.

1359
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:31,440
James Bond Bloodstone comes out on 360 this week as well as Mass Effect 2, the Japanese

1360
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,440
edition.

1361
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,600
It took them a little while to localize it for those guys.

1362
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:39,000
Stoked, big air edition also on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

1363
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:46,720
And a very limited edition Arcana Heart 3 arcade stick coming out as well.

1364
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:53,820
Coming out on the Playstation 3, Arcana Heart 3 gets a version there as well and a joystick

1365
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:58,660
and James Bond Bloodstone also coming out on the Playstation 3 in Japan.

1366
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,600
So the releases kind of mirror each other there.

1367
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,880
Nothing on the Wii this week, in fact things are kind of quiet from Nintendo until we get

1368
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,160
to the last story in a couple weeks.

1369
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:11,400
And then of course Nintendo is going to be all about the 3DS in Japan in just a little

1370
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,400
bit.

1371
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,080
So things are going to be quiet there for a little bit, but we'll get back to them in

1372
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,080
a while.

1373
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:20,600
The DS, also very quiet unless you want to get Zombie Daisuke, oh wait that's actually

1374
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,600
next week.

1375
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,000
So there's nothing on the DS this week.

1376
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,640
But how about the PSP, there's a few games coming out there.

1377
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:33,080
Macross Ultimate Frontier gets a price reduction this week as does Umiwaza Yikari no Yasashi

1378
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,040
Igo gets a price reduction.

1379
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,720
It's not coming out, it's getting a little cheaper and more affordable.

1380
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:46,720
And this game is, it's like that old game Go, but like with one of the world's experts

1381
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:54,440
who's this kind of cute chick in her cyber form helping you to play that old game.

1382
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,720
Does she strip Go naked if I do well?

1383
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,720
It's not strip Go.

1384
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,160
Get your mind out of the gutter.

1385
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,760
Not interested.

1386
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:06,880
Also Black Robina comes out this week from one of my favorite named companies over there,

1387
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:07,880
Broccoli.

1388
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,280
You know what else Broccoli did?

1389
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,280
What else?

1390
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,280
Digi-Carrot.

1391
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,280
Ah.

1392
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,880
Well they're doing Black Robina on the PSP this week.

1393
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,240
That's it for Japanese releases.

1394
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,880
Well for Europe there's a few.

1395
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,260
We have Zite on Xbox 360 for the 12th.

1396
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:29,120
On the 14th is DC Universe Online and Ghost Trick.

1397
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,760
And also Kingdom Hearts Recoded.

1398
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,760
And that's it.

1399
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,940
Alright we're almost to the Classic Game of the Week, but first a couple more stories

1400
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:39,360
for you guys.

1401
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,360
And this next story, you're going to want to remember this when we get into Part B tonight.

1402
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,360
Yes.

1403
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:51,360
HQ has partnered with Mattel and they're going to be doing some brand new license games based

1404
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,480
on their properties.

1405
01:12:53,480 --> 01:13:00,560
And of course some of the deals that they have in place already, well they've already

1406
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,920
got some stuff I guess.

1407
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:08,800
He-Man by the power of Greyskull.

1408
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,180
So that's kind of cool.

1409
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:15,300
And then they haven't really said what other rights they're also going to be working with

1410
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,300
I guess.

1411
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:21,120
Ah let's see here, they said Barbie Hot Wheels.

1412
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,080
It's kind of odd because Barbie and Hot Wheels right now, Activision kind of has the rights

1413
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,200
to those because they've been making games for them for a while now.

1414
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,000
Mainly the Barbie stuff off of the DVD movies.

1415
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
If you believe it or not they keep releasing DVD movies for Barbie stuff.

1416
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:46,920
Fisher Price, Rock'em Sock'em Robots, Masters of the Universe, and Polly Pocket.

1417
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:51,920
And of course you know people are wondering, also they're going to be maybe doing some

1418
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:58,640
tie-ins with the U-Draw game tablet because they do have that by the way.

1419
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,440
So I don't know, it's interesting.

1420
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:07,720
I wonder if they're going to be doing any off of the new Masters of the Universe series.

1421
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,800
Is that even still around?

1422
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,800
Do they show it in reruns?

1423
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,800
I don't know.

1424
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,080
Weren't they supposed to be optioning a new movie or something for that?

1425
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,320
Well Dolph Lundgren needs more work.

1426
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,360
I'm serious man, the guy- Isn't he like senile by now?

1427
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,040
He's got to be getting pretty old.

1428
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,760
He was in Expendables, he's not that old.

1429
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:31,000
Well Expendables was different though, it brought back everybody for that movie.

1430
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,360
They're all pretty old.

1431
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:36,160
Alright, one more story for you guys, then the classic game of the week.

1432
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:39,240
And this has to do with some big announcements, the Consumer Electronics Show this week, which

1433
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:43,900
usually isn't a gaming show per se, but a few things will always get slipped in there

1434
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:48,360
because of course gaming consoles are what's in your living room.

1435
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:52,840
And one place that gaming consoles have really expanded beyond just the place you play video

1436
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:58,100
games is being an entertainment device, letting you watch movies and Netflix on them.

1437
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:01,480
And Microsoft talked a little bit about Netflix expansion.

1438
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:06,000
Coming this spring, Netflix will get Kinect enabled.

1439
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,560
So you'll be able to flail your arms to queue up episodes of Veronica Mars if that's how

1440
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,560
you choose to do it.

1441
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,600
I bet this will be one of those things where you use it a couple times to impress your

1442
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,480
friends and then you're done with it.

1443
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:21,960
Because you know, as cool as the Kinect technology is, I don't know, it'd be a little slow to

1444
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,640
like wave your arms and then kind of look for the movie you're looking for.

1445
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,880
Now where this might be really cool is that instead of fumbling for the controller, which

1446
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:36,200
is probably off, if you're able to say, Kinect, pause, so you can go up and get a sandwich,

1447
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,200
that will be great.

1448
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,600
That will be the coolest thing about Xbox Netflix.

1449
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,320
Kinect, make me a sandwich.

1450
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,540
Maybe next year's CES, who knows.

1451
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,840
Also announced though is that Hulu will be coming to Xbox.

1452
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,140
It's out on the PlayStation, but Hulu Plus will be coming to the Xbox 360 at the same

1453
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:53,320
time later this spring.

1454
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:54,820
So there you go.

1455
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:59,060
One other little tidbit that was dropped in the press conference, remember how Microsoft

1456
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:03,320
had a goal of selling 5 million Kinect units by Christmas?

1457
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:07,720
Well they came out at CES and said they sold 8 million units.

1458
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:12,080
But some people have said, wait a minute, did you really sell 8 million units?

1459
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,360
Or did you push 8 million units out there to retailers?

1460
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,640
Hmm.

1461
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,760
Well regardless of however the numbers are being skewed, it still is a fairly impressive

1462
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,760
amount.

1463
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:26,700
I guarantee if they, I think those are sold numbers because they haven't been sitting

1464
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,700
on shelves.

1465
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:28,700
Let me put it that way.

1466
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:30,880
They're hard to find.

1467
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,880
So yeah, and who knew?

1468
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,000
A lot of people thought that that was going to be a high number for them to break because

1469
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,480
that's way more than they sold 360s in the first year.

1470
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:45,440
Of course 360s were really hard to get at that time, so I don't know.

1471
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,840
These are still hard to get.

1472
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,640
Are they really?

1473
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,640
I guess I'm spoiled by what you have to say.

1474
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,600
It seems that way at least.

1475
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,080
Probably not for retailers.

1476
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:56,840
It's pretty easy to get for them.

1477
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:02,280
I like how everybody in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrady.com is coming out with their own ideas for what

1478
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,240
Connect should do on voice command.

1479
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:08,760
Like DDR Dollar Bill says, Connect, get me a beer.

1480
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:14,000
Frisbee in our chatroom says, Computer, end holodeck.

1481
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,040
DDR Dollar Bill says, Connect, ban this douchebag who called me a racial slur.

1482
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:24,000
Someday, someday.

1483
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,280
Tiger Claw, Xbox, play Tron, Tron, Tron, I said Tron, damn it.

1484
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,440
Yeah, it would be like the voice recognition on the DS.

1485
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:38,920
Blue, blue, brew.

1486
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,320
That joke will make sense if you've ever played Brain Age.

1487
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:44,880
Alright, let's move on to the classic game of the week.

1488
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,880
Yay.

1489
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:51,480
It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane to gaming's past where Dark Soccer is

1490
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:55,740
going to step into the vault and pull a game out of the archives and she thinks, hey, you

1491
01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:03,000
ungrateful kids, you should put down all those newfangled holiday toys and your 3DSs and

1492
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,920
play games the way we used to where we had to walk barefoot through the snow both ways,

1493
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:14,800
20 miles up the river and eat our grape nuts to play these games.

1494
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,800
I'm still hungry, Rob.

1495
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,400
All I've had is pizza.

1496
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,520
Alright, what is the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer?

1497
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:26,020
Space Fury, specifically Space Fury on the ColecoVision.

1498
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,560
You have to play a little bit of, you have to play the opening taunt.

1499
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,120
I love that music.

1500
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,120
Okay.

1501
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:45,640
So this is the screen where you select your difficulty.

1502
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,800
Suddenly I'm watching a Space Odyssey.

1503
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,160
That was something that we heard a lot of in my house when I was in the third grade.

1504
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,160
I love this game.

1505
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,160
Isn't it great?

1506
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,160
Okay.

1507
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:59,000
Now, before I go into the ColecoVision version, which is what this is, I'm going to have to

1508
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
go into the arcade version.

1509
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,160
It was put out by Sega on June 17th, 1981.

1510
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:09,960
It has a rotate left, rotate right and thrust and fire.

1511
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,880
So basically it's kind of, it kind of plays like asteroids, but you, as you go through

1512
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,840
the game, you actually can get like a little armored unit that takes you to different levels

1513
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,920
of different things you can shoot, except that these little segments combine into a

1514
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,920
bigger segment.

1515
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:29,360
And then you have to, you know, blow up the smaller segments and stuff, but they can blow

1516
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,360
you up.

1517
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,560
It looks like a little bit time pilot, which kind of was asteroids inspired too.

1518
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,400
It's kind of like between the two.

1519
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,100
As far as the arcade, the arcade version was vector.

1520
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:45,160
So of course this one's not vector, but the, uh, the arcade version, it was vector on an

1521
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:50,040
XY monitor and it ran on the Sega G80 arcade system.

1522
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:56,960
Had some of the best lines in it, like, so a creature for my amusement, prepare for battle.

1523
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,040
And my favorite one is, and I keep in mind, my mother was great at this game.

1524
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,400
She played a lot of freaking space fury.

1525
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:09,200
Um, but like when you, uh, win the game, basically the last thing that you get is, our battle

1526
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,360
is concluded, warrior.

1527
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,960
You were a stimulating opponent.

1528
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:19,160
And the alien in this also appears in a video game called Zektor.

1529
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:24,320
Now for the Colecovision version, of course it's sprite based.

1530
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,160
It's, you know, really, really early video game system.

1531
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,840
I don't know what else I can say about that.

1532
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:36,360
Um, but you use the little, uh, uh, cause it had the keypad controller, so you'd actually,

1533
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:43,320
uh, thrust and go with your little side shoulders and fire that the same way and, uh, move around.

1534
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,240
It was actually kind of hard to control.

1535
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:51,120
I was not good at this game, but like I said, a lot of this game happened in my house.

1536
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:58,440
And you can get, you know, power ups for shooting and, you know, get extra, uh, bullets and

1537
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,440
everything.

1538
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,320
So it was really cool, but, it's simple.

1539
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,240
You blow shit up, the game.

1540
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:09,760
I love this game and I played it on the Colecovision actually, it was one of the games that I really

1541
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,760
enjoyed playing.

1542
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,560
I never had a Colecovision growing up.

1543
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,560
Well...

1544
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,200
I've got two, you wanna borrow one?

1545
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,680
I'm not growing up anymore.

1546
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:20,000
Oh come on, Rob, we know you're still growing up.

1547
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,440
I am.

1548
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,520
This is when it talked to you.

1549
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:31,080
The voice is so realistic.

1550
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:35,120
That's even better than Impossible Mission.

1551
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:39,480
Another visitor, stay awhile, stay forever.

1552
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,960
So that's Space Fury.

1553
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:46,220
Alright, your classic game of the week this week is Space Fury.

1554
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:47,440
Good pick.

1555
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,520
Even if it's not one I'm super familiar with, it looked very interesting, so I will have

1556
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,520
to check it out.

1557
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:53,840
I think I've already done Gorf, haven't I?

1558
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:54,840
I'm sure you have.

1559
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,840
I'm sure you have.

1560
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,600
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, guys, but don't go anywhere.

1561
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,080
We're gonna be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio in Part B tonight.

1562
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:07,640
We're gonna do some quick, quick news, including some news on what's going on with APB, Bionic

1563
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:11,040
Commander Rearmed 2, we got some news on, and we're gonna get some other news stories

1564
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:16,960
tonight about the Mac App Store, of course, your Twitter topics, the mailbag, and, because

1565
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,520
Dark Sakura specifically asked for it before the show started tonight, we're gonna do a

1566
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:21,520
list list tonight.

1567
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,720
I hope you were paying attention in Part A, because it has to do with what our list list

1568
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,720
is about.

1569
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:35,560
We'll tell you all about that when we come right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

1570
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:39,600
And welcome back, everybody, to Part B of tonight's Orange Launch Radio.

1571
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:47,640
It is episode number 396 for this January the 9th of 2011.

1572
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,640
And I know we can't play the music on the break when you guys listen to this on the

1573
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:55,320
podcast, but we had some music from Tron in there, just because Loki was talking about

1574
01:22:55,320 --> 01:23:00,080
how he wanted to go see that just one more time before it leaves the whole D-Box thing.

1575
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:04,240
And I'm kind of in the same boat, except the place I need to see it is IMAX, and even though

1576
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:08,920
I hear it's actually not as great on IMAX as it is in 3D, at least that was a consensus

1577
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:13,000
on my Facebook post earlier this week, I still just feel like I need to see it, so I see

1578
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,960
it once in every format.

1579
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,800
But I guess the Blu-ray's coming out soon.

1580
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,640
Well, not soon, but, you know, it will come out and that will be a must-have.

1581
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:24,880
But Blu-rays that came out recently that I need to see, I still have not seen this movie,

1582
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,880
can you believe it?

1583
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:26,880
Inception?

1584
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,400
I still haven't seen it, and I need to.

1585
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,400
You do need to see that.

1586
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,400
That is pretty awesome.

1587
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,400
I hear it.

1588
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,120
I've heard nothing but great things about that movie, and now that the Blu-ray's out,

1589
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,640
I'm gonna need to see that, so.

1590
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,880
It is absolutely something you should see.

1591
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,960
That was something else I missed in D-Box, though that would have been a good movie in

1592
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:43,960
D-Box.

1593
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:44,960
Inception.

1594
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,960
Oh, really?

1595
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:46,960
Yeah.

1596
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,800
Well, D-Box is kind of really, really new, isn't it?

1597
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,800
It's really, really new, yeah.

1598
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,720
The theater out here that has it is like brand spanking new.

1599
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:58,400
It's brand spanking new, and it's only in one theater, and it's only one row of seats,

1600
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,760
so it's pretty-

1601
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,760
It's two rows of seats in the theater I was in.

1602
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,760
Oh.

1603
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:03,760
Then maybe it is two rows.

1604
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,760
I thought it was just one.

1605
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,280
But yeah, it's only one theater that they have it in.

1606
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,280
Oh, wow.

1607
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,280
Very limited, but.

1608
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,280
So.

1609
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,860
It's fun, and it's one of 30 theaters that has it.

1610
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:16,840
And that's, of course, the seats that move, the little motion seats that, you know.

1611
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:17,840
It's fun.

1612
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,120
It's completely unnecessary for a lot of movies.

1613
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:24,200
Like the only movie I've seen in D-Box was the Resident Evil movie, and honestly, I'm

1614
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:28,360
not a fan of the Resident Evil series and stuff, but that movie is so far away from

1615
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,360
the Resident Evil game series.

1616
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:33,080
It's more of like The Matrix now.

1617
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:36,760
It was still pretty cool, and I think with Tron, though, just even watching Tron the

1618
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:40,200
first time around, it's gonna be awesome with the D-Box stuff.

1619
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,520
I'm really looking forward to it.

1620
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,800
Let us know when you're going.

1621
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,320
I even think, though, probably Wednesday during the day-

1622
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:48,440
I'm glad I did the D-Box thing, but it was a little silly.

1623
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,680
It was a little silly.

1624
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,040
But it's cool to say you did it.

1625
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,040
Which movie did you do it for?

1626
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,040
Tron.

1627
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,040
Oh, you did?

1628
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,040
Yeah.

1629
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,040
We saw Christmas Eve.

1630
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,040
Oh.

1631
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,040
Did you like it?

1632
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,040
D-Box?

1633
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:05,200
Because I really liked Tron, yes, but it was a little unnecessary, and it was kind of expensive.

1634
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,200
Don't expect to get just, like, thrown around in the seats, because that ain't happening.

1635
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:12,320
I mean, you can't adjust the intensity of it, but I would compare it a little more to

1636
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,080
like Captain EO, where the movements in the seats are very subtle.

1637
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,520
No, I just, there was a lot of the flying stuff in there, I thought that'd be pretty

1638
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,520
cool.

1639
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,520
Yeah, some of it's kind of neat.

1640
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,480
But I kind of agree, and I think we had talked about it on the show a couple weeks ago, or

1641
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:27,240
maybe, I don't remember, but one of the things that kind of takes you out of the reality

1642
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:32,400
of it is that it is not an IMAX screen, and your field of vision is not completely the

1643
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,400
movie, because it's a regular-sized movie screen, and I think if the screen were a lot

1644
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,960
bigger or you had something else in those seats to take the rest of your field of vision

1645
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:45,680
away, that would make it truly amazing, I think.

1646
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:49,320
Or that they have to make it like pitch pitch black in there, which they can't, you know,

1647
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:53,000
that's what they do on things like Star Tours and stuff, to kind of take you out of that,

1648
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,080
but yeah, you know, they can't do that for emergency reasons and for people who want

1649
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:00,600
to leave to go to the bathroom, so yeah.

1650
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:04,880
I think D-Box still has some tweaking that they need to do, but it was, you know what,

1651
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,880
it was fun.

1652
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:11,880
To save up like the eight grand or whatever, get a home unit, they have them, it's compatible

1653
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,320
with a lot of those movies.

1654
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:19,840
You know, I wouldn't invest in that again unless it was a movie like Tron where I know

1655
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:26,400
I love it and I want to see it a new way, and you know, that's really it.

1656
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,920
DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says, so a D-Box is like Honey, I Shrunk the Audience

1657
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:30,920
at Disney.

1658
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,400
No, because those chairs don't move.

1659
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:36,160
The movie's a lot better, too, because Honey, I Shrunk the Audience was terrible.

1660
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:39,080
Well, those seats don't move, though, in Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

1661
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,600
A little bit, they do a little bit.

1662
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,600
A little bit.

1663
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,880
And I liked that because Eric Idle is in it.

1664
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:48,240
There's a part when the baby picks up the audience and does this thing and-

1665
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,000
You gotta admit, that part was pretty cool.

1666
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,880
Yeah, but the movie itself was dopey.

1667
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,600
Yeah, it was.

1668
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,120
It really outstayed its welcome.

1669
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,000
I mean, when was the last time they made a Honey, I blank the kids?

1670
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,880
Well, you know, I had to say because Eric Idle was in it.

1671
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,080
I am really sad that Rick Moranis is not getting more work.

1672
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,120
I mean, seriously.

1673
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,240
That was by his choice, I believe.

1674
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,120
I believe he retired to raise his children.

1675
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,840
Okay, well, then props to him.

1676
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,840
Once you make Strange Brew, you can retire.

1677
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,320
That's what it is, I guess.

1678
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,320
All right.

1679
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,880
I still think his best movie was My Blue Heaven.

1680
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,760
But his children have to be grown up by now.

1681
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,400
I mean, come on, go back.

1682
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:27,760
The rumor is he'll cameo in Ghostbusters 3, but we'll see.

1683
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,640
There's lots of rumors about that movie.

1684
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,040
That's a day one for me.

1685
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,040
All right.

1686
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,360
Anyhow, Twitter topics coming up very soon.

1687
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:39,520
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. First, we're going to get into some rapid fire news, but I also

1688
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,160
have to give quick, quick plugs for the other shows.

1689
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:47,560
Dark Sakura does a side podcast with her friends, Marin Marvel and Dan Shadow.

1690
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:50,400
It's called Comic Insanity, and we have a Twitter now.

1691
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,800
It's Comic Insanity without an I before the N.

1692
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:58,600
And yes, we got a tweet from Comic Insanity tonight, so we'll read that in a little bit.

1693
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:59,600
Yep.

1694
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:05,240
And we, the podcast goes up every Tuesday at Infamous.net.

1695
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,660
That's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.

1696
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:10,160
Or the iTunes store, I'm sure.

1697
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,160
We are in the iTunes store.

1698
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,160
Awesome.

1699
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,520
And you have to listen to it.

1700
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:17,400
If you're a loyal O-L-R listener, you have to listen to that, too.

1701
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,640
And you should also listen to Hoard House.

1702
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:23,320
Even if you don't play Wow, you can hear Extrovert Make Dick and Fart Jokes.

1703
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:27,440
Hoard House, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth, tapes on Thursdays, typically.

1704
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:31,080
We don't want to be held to that, but usually if we don't do Thursday, we'll do Friday.

1705
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:34,480
So later in the week is when we do our show and we put it right up on iTunes so you folks

1706
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,640
can grab that.

1707
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,760
And yeah, it's a fun show.

1708
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:40,140
We always have a third random guest, and Dark Soccer has made it known she wants to come

1709
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,480
on and be that guest.

1710
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,440
So we're gonna work her into a future episode.

1711
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,100
Sadly won't happen this week.

1712
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:48,280
We're having our gala 10th episode special this week.

1713
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:49,280
A look back...

1714
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,280
10th anniversary?

1715
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,280
Yes.

1716
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:53,480
A look back at 10 hilarious episodes of The Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth.

1717
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,480
It'll be a good time.

1718
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,640
And very self-serving because that's what anniversary podcasts should be.

1719
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,480
They're making a big, big deal for our...

1720
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:03,120
Like I'm telling you, the 10th episode of Hoard House is a much bigger deal than 400

1721
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,120
episodes of OLR.

1722
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:07,280
I mean, I'm sorry, but that's, that's just...

1723
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,280
It's a joke, Dark Soccer.

1724
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,280
It's...

1725
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,280
Get it?

1726
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,280
I'm eating.

1727
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:15,040
All right, let's get to some rapid fire news.

1728
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,840
I can't make weird faces at you when I'm doing chipmunk cheeks.

1729
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,640
We don't have a website, by the way.

1730
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:23,120
We're not on Infamous.net and we are not even on OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1731
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:27,840
We have a blog spot and really, that's just the shell for the podcast feed.

1732
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,840
Awesome.

1733
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,240
So, we don't have a website right now.

1734
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,240
Before I forget, Geek Life.

1735
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,120
Go to geek-life.com.

1736
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:37,160
We're having a comic book giveaway, so go in there and read about it.

1737
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,960
And by the way, speaking of Geek Life, Maren Marvel, who runs that and who has filled in

1738
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:45,480
for me on this very program, she was on episode 8 of Hoard House, not this week's, but last

1739
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,480
week's episode.

1740
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,480
She did a phenomenal job.

1741
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:49,540
So if you haven't heard that episode of Hoard House, you should go listen to it.

1742
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:50,960
She did a very good job.

1743
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:57,320
All right, let's go and to some rapid fire news, some of the news stories that we just

1744
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:01,600
didn't find the long amounts of time to talk about in other parts of the show, but we want

1745
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,320
to talk about them anyway.

1746
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:07,000
APB Reloaded, they're doing a beta for it.

1747
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
How ironic, because I actually participated in the original APB beta.

1748
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:16,660
But if you're interested in that, they're going to be starting to close beta in February.

1749
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:23,460
The official Twitter account, APB Reloaded, has more information on that.

1750
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:29,320
And apparently they're going to be having, you can sign up on the official website.

1751
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:36,160
And it is of course going to be free to play when it finally launches, unlike the original

1752
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,160
APB.

1753
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:42,800
And I didn't think APB was that bad of a game.

1754
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:47,600
I thought it was actually pretty cool, but unfortunately it didn't last too long.

1755
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:52,160
But definitely worth checking out, especially since it's going to be free to play.

1756
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:56,920
The PSP Go has been hacked, not surprisingly.

1757
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:06,800
The brand new, I guess, firmware, 6.31 and 6.35, have a new homebrew enabler for them.

1758
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:13,640
And using this homebrew enabler, you're actually able to load the Prometheus ISO Loader, which

1759
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:19,280
for those who don't know, it loads dumps of different PSP games.

1760
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:26,800
And of course the PSP game to show off your hack would be Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep,

1761
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:33,680
the PSP game that does not have a digital version of it on the PlayStation Network Store,

1762
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:37,400
pissing off people that own a PSP Go.

1763
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:43,480
And of course, this homebrew enabler doesn't really require any sort of tricks to get it

1764
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:49,120
to work, so that's not good news for Sony, but I'm sure they'll try to find a way to

1765
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:52,280
patch that out.

1766
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:59,600
And then finally, there's a couple games in this series that have been available on the

1767
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,220
IOS store.

1768
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:08,560
Of course the Japanese App Store, or if you have a jailbroken iPhone or iPod, you can

1769
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,320
also find these available as well.

1770
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:16,320
It's Game Dev Story, and of course there's Game Dev Story 2.

1771
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:22,800
Well now there's a brand new game that they have coming out called YY the Game Dealer.

1772
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:30,680
It's basically a game retail store sim.

1773
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:35,200
And the Game Dealer, you assume the role of a game store boss who must manage employees

1774
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:41,040
and please customers, all while balancing the stock portfolio of game development studios,

1775
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:48,700
and apparently also be able to offer customers food, and shoo-way mall rats from the free

1776
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,700
food mini-games.

1777
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:54,280
That's funny.

1778
01:32:54,280 --> 01:33:00,340
But I guess the Game Dealer is available on the Japanese App Store right now.

1779
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:02,240
That sounds like fun.

1780
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:05,920
That's real life for a lot of people that listen to this show, I'm sure.

1781
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,920
Awesome.

1782
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:11,440
Alright, let's go to Rock Band and what is coming out this week in Rock Band.

1783
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,640
They're still kicking along with new releases.

1784
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:18,480
Although this is a new release, I'm going to take a big fat pass on, but maybe some

1785
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,040
of you out there are into this.

1786
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:23,560
Linkin Park Pack comes out this week, January 11th.

1787
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:29,720
Crawling in the End, Numb, Somewhere I Belong, Waiting for the End, and What I've Done.

1788
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:34,920
All those songs are coming out for either 160 Microsoft Points, 200 Wii Points, or $1.99

1789
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:36,420
on the PlayStation Store.

1790
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:42,120
You can also get some Pro Guitar or Bass expansions for the song, In the End, and What I've Done.

1791
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:45,960
Again, if you like Linkin Park, that is.

1792
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:49,360
If you are a fan of Elder Scrolls and you were just sitting there tapping your fingers

1793
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:54,560
waiting for Skyrim to come out, well maybe now is a good time to go back and visit Morrowind.

1794
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:59,840
There's a brand new mod that just came out called Morrowind 2011, Morrowind 2011 was

1795
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:06,080
a mod that was released last week, and it basically makes Morrowind just even more gorgeous

1796
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,080
than it was originally.

1797
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:10,760
Because remember Morrowind, I mean it was, for the time it was awesome graphics, but

1798
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:14,680
man they really kind of upped the graphics, there was a bunch of mods out there that just

1799
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:16,600
made the game look beautiful.

1800
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:21,680
Well here's the thing though, it was out, but then it was pulled, because I guess this

1801
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:26,400
used some other mods in it, and maybe the right people didn't quite get credit for it,

1802
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,520
when some of the original modders complained on the Bethesda forums that their work was

1803
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:30,760
being used.

1804
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:35,440
So the original mod was pulled, but you guys know, once it hits the internet, it's never

1805
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,080
truly off of the internet.

1806
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:42,920
The author who originally made this whole expansion, he talked about it on his blog,

1807
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:48,240
which is at Morrowind2011.wordpress.com, he said quote, in the end I'm just very disappointed

1808
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:52,200
that I wasn't given a chance to correct the issues with the package, as I knew there were

1809
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,980
issues that were in the process of being fixed or updated.

1810
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:58,160
But the file is out on the internet, and it will be very hard for anyone to remove it

1811
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,920
from all the sites.

1812
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:05,600
Anyhow, one other thing, and I'm very excited about this, the Facebook Civilization game.

1813
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,880
That's right, I'm getting excited about a Facebook game, what are you going to do about

1814
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:08,880
it?

1815
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,600
Civilization World starts its alpha testing phase on January 12th.

1816
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:17,720
You can go sign up for it now, but it was a little weird, because I guess you need to

1817
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:21,800
have like a team name and all this other stuff, I don't know, it didn't make a lot of sense

1818
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,640
to me when I was filling it out, and I don't know if I want to play the alpha, I'll just

1819
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:25,640
wait for the open beta.

1820
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:29,240
But that means this game is mere months away, so very exciting, and when you look at the

1821
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:32,880
graphics for it, it looks very like chibi and cute and kind of unlike any other Civ

1822
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,680
game we've seen yet, so it's going to be very interesting.

1823
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:43,160
Civ World, again, you can sign up at 2kgames.com slash civworld slash alpha.

1824
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,540
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?

1825
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:51,960
More stuff, and some weird stuff among it, but including this weird ass mustache.

1826
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,160
And I'll get into that.

1827
01:35:53,160 --> 01:36:00,960
Basically, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 is coming out, along with an extra mustache on the dude,

1828
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,600
and jumping!

1829
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:07,280
It will be on Playstation Network on Tuesday, February 1st, it will be $15, and then the

1830
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:12,100
next day it will be on Xbox Live Arcade for 1200 Microsoft points.

1831
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,680
And there will be challenge rooms and mustache!

1832
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:18,040
So yeah.

1833
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:21,040
It's very Burt Reynolds, porn-stache-looking.

1834
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:25,080
Anyway, there's still more Sailor Moon stuff, Rob.

1835
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,080
Did you know that?

1836
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,880
Sailor Moon!

1837
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:36,200
Well, Sailor Moon is having a new DS game come out in Italy!

1838
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:42,600
Anamco Bandai Europe is bringing the first Sailor Moon DS game, and it's the second Sailor

1839
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:46,120
Moon game that's being released outside of Japan.

1840
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:54,040
And it's called La Luna Splenda, which, yeah, very Sailor Moon-y.

1841
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:58,200
And they're saying it's adventure, fantasy, fun, action, these are the watchwords for

1842
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:00,360
next spring.

1843
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:06,880
Yeah, the last Sailor Moon game that I had was on the Super Nintendo.

1844
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:13,560
And trailers for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 reveal two more characters.

1845
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:18,320
And one of them I saw coming, the other one I'm like, why?

1846
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,900
Even though it is cool, don't get me wrong, it's absolutely cool.

1847
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:25,840
The first one we get is Hagar from Final Fight.

1848
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,800
And what is it, Saturday Night Slam Masters?

1849
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,800
That game was so awesome.

1850
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,720
I wish we could get that on Xbox Live Arcade.

1851
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:36,400
He's gonna be wrasslin' his way through Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1852
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:40,720
And then Phoenix, which I'm like, why?

1853
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:46,300
I think it's really why, but at the same time, very very cool with lots of Fuego, and she

1854
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:48,740
freakin' has Dark Phoenix mode.

1855
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:49,740
So that's really cool.

1856
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:53,860
I like how the characters have multiple modes for them based on their level of, you know,

1857
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:54,860
how powered up they are.

1858
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:56,360
It's pretty cool.

1859
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:58,200
So booyah.

1860
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,960
This game is out, what, next month is it?

1861
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:00,960
I can't remember.

1862
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:01,960
Yes.

1863
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:02,960
I get my release dates all mixed up.

1864
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,960
That's gonna be exciting.

1865
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:04,960
It's pretty cool.

1866
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:05,960
Alright.

1867
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:07,440
Well is that it for the rapid fire news?

1868
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:08,440
Yarp.

1869
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:11,240
Then we will get into the Twitter topics for tonight.

1870
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:17,160
I'm gonna go to the tweeters, twitter.com slash o-l-r, where you show us your tweets

1871
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:20,240
every Sunday night you're on this program.

1872
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:25,200
Let's start off with a tweet from Comic Insanity, hmm, I didn't just hear a plug for them earlier

1873
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:26,820
in the show or what have you.

1874
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:31,960
It's a story about Street Fighter characters for WWE Raw versus SmackDown, which is this

1875
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:35,720
trailer here, sorry for the extra music there, but I got linked to a YouTube.

1876
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:41,600
I guess they have actually kind of used the editor mode to make like Ken and Vega and

1877
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:46,800
Blanca, Dalsim, somebody having fun with the editor mode there.

1878
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:47,800
That's kind of cute.

1879
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:48,800
Oh yeah.

1880
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,000
I like how they can get the interview with M. Bison and everything, kind of funny.

1881
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,800
Yeah, we were talking about that on the show earlier.

1882
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:55,800
Oh were you?

1883
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:56,800
Yeah.

1884
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,800
Yeah.

1885
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:02,640
That's very well done and the moves are pretty much what you'd expect out of them.

1886
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:06,240
You know, I don't really play a lot of these wrestling games, but that's pretty cool.

1887
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,240
Dude, Dudley.

1888
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,240
Yeah.

1889
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:09,240
I like this too.

1890
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:12,760
In the side, like what's recommended, it looks like there's a Felicia in one of these.

1891
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,760
Like somebody did that.

1892
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:16,000
Wow.

1893
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,600
Big boobies on Felicia, alright anyway.

1894
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:27,360
Moving on, going to SSJ100Matt on Twitter, our pal YYR will be at MAGFest in Washington

1895
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,200
D.C. next week showing off his games.

1896
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:32,560
Local listeners should stop by, MAGFest.org.

1897
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,680
Well if you're in the Washington D.C. area and you happen to be going to MAGFest, say

1898
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:41,120
hello to YYR for us because he does a lot of great indie games on the marketplace like

1899
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:46,680
Snake 360 and the Shooting Gallery game and Falling.

1900
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:49,960
Lots of good stuff so check that out at Ollie's booth.

1901
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:54,880
Dark Tetsuya wants to relay a bit of bad news for us.

1902
01:39:54,880 --> 01:40:00,080
Apparently we had a BeatMania 2DX Resort Anthem machine at Roseville Golf Land.

1903
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,640
It's been moved to Milpenis.

1904
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,380
Bye.

1905
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:05,380
That sucks.

1906
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:06,380
Like did...

1907
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:07,380
To hell with them.

1908
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,480
Does that mean the whole 2DX machine's gone all together?

1909
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,480
That blows.

1910
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:13,480
F you Milpenis.

1911
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:14,480
Milpenis.

1912
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,920
Alright.

1913
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:17,920
How mature of you.

1914
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,040
I know, I'm so mature.

1915
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,840
Tiger Claw wants to send us some links here.

1916
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:29,200
Tiger Claw says Ion and Atari is teaming up for the iCade, a classic arcade machine setup

1917
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,200
for your iPad.

1918
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:35,400
Oh that's adorable, it's this cute little machine with tangible joystick and buttons

1919
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:41,920
that you can put your iPad in and like play old games with.

1920
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:42,920
That's cool.

1921
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:43,920
I like that.

1922
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:50,000
I love the fact that you can buy a, you know, I know it's a really expensive way of playing

1923
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,680
something that you can get a million other ways, but it's still cute.

1924
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:57,600
I say it was cute.

1925
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,800
And one more tweet for us from Tiger Claw.

1926
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:05,080
Microsoft confirms that Kinect PC support is coming.

1927
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:06,080
Well good.

1928
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:09,720
They should, as it should be, because if the modding community is so far ahead of them

1929
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:11,080
it's almost a little bit embarrassing.

1930
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,560
I mean it is coming, it already is here basically.

1931
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:17,760
Well my official Kinect PC support is coming.

1932
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:22,520
Steve Ballmer hinted at this support in his keynote speech there.

1933
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,680
It is part of the company's larger plan.

1934
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:29,000
Well, we certainly started out on Xbox and we're very focused in on gaming.

1935
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,880
We're the number one game console in a lot of countries and we're very happy about that.

1936
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:36,240
We're trying to do two major things though.

1937
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:41,600
We're trying to move beyond gaming to include the world of socialization, movies, TV, and

1938
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:46,240
music and we're trying to make the whole experience accessible to everybody in the family, not

1939
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,000
just the traditional gamer.

1940
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,680
So just expect this whole Kinect craze to grow, at least if Microsoft's keynote is to

1941
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:54,640
be taken at face value.

1942
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:59,520
Those are the tweets tonight at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Let's move into some more gaming

1943
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:00,520
news.

1944
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:02,000
Hey, guess what's coming up in just a little bit?

1945
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,040
Listless!

1946
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,240
And tonight's topic is?

1947
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:06,840
Well, I'll tell you in a little bit.

1948
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:09,600
We need, we're going to need somebody from the chat room to participate with us tonight,

1949
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:10,600
aren't we?

1950
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:11,600
We're going to need a fourth person.

1951
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:12,600
We sure will.

1952
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,000
So I better find someone quick.

1953
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,720
I'm going to see, I have a particular person in mind.

1954
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:17,040
I want to see if they want to participate.

1955
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:20,440
If not, I'll open it up to anyone.

1956
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:24,260
All right.

1957
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:28,800
So this is kind of interesting and not too different than what they were doing.

1958
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:36,540
I guess it's an improvement maybe, but THQ for homefronts, they're doing the online pass

1959
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,740
thing again.

1960
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:41,880
But this time, instead of just saying, hey, you know what, you better buy the game new

1961
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:48,280
or pay the $10 and have no online play, they're saying, hey, you know what, you better buy

1962
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:55,220
the game new or pay $10 or have limited online play.

1963
01:42:55,220 --> 01:43:00,080
They're going to allow you to play the multiplayer component of the game, however, you're only

1964
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:06,480
going to be able to level up to level five versus the full game's level 75.

1965
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:10,900
So kind of give you a little bit of a taste of the online portion of the game.

1966
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:14,800
Of course, if you're going to want to play the online portion, you're probably going

1967
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:23,200
to want to buy the game new or perhaps not rent the game.

1968
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,240
I don't know.

1969
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:28,560
It's still kind of a crappy way of doing things, but it's slightly better than not offering

1970
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,780
any online component at all.

1971
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:33,920
So now you get a demo of the online component.

1972
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,760
That's basically what this boils down to.

1973
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,880
That's kind of weird.

1974
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,760
That's them combating the use sales.

1975
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:48,080
But of course, I don't know if this is a game I'm particularly interested in, so we'll see.

1976
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,080
Who knows?

1977
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,080
It'll look cool.

1978
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,080
All right.

1979
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,480
Let's move on to another story here about the Mac App Store.

1980
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:54,480
It is out.

1981
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,480
It came out this week.

1982
01:43:55,480 --> 01:44:00,000
And guess what the number one thing that's being sold on the Mac App Store is right now?

1983
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Angry Birds.

1984
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
That's right.

1985
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,400
Angry Birds is the number one application.

1986
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:04,960
Some other games are showing up in the top 10.

1987
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:08,440
Of course, this changes day by day, so it might not be totally accurate, but some of

1988
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:12,680
the early leaders were Flight Control HD and Chopper 2.

1989
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:13,680
That's right.

1990
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:18,520
Some of the same crap that you see on the iPhone and iPad is also dominating the Mac

1991
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,520
App Store.

1992
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:25,120
Now, if you don't know what the Mac App Store is, it's basically imagine Steam and Apple

1993
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:26,120
kind of combined.

1994
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:32,400
It's selling, I don't want to say PC games, but Mac games like for your actual Mac in

1995
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:35,760
the same vein that you buy iPad and iPod stuff right now.

1996
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:36,760
I think it's a great idea.

1997
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:41,600
Well, it's a very logical idea that makes sense and especially because, you know, a

1998
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,120
lot of these games are kind of cheaper this way.

1999
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:46,800
Like games like Chopper 2, 99 cents.

2000
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,720
Angry Birds, five bucks.

2001
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:54,160
So I mean that's much cheaper than going into an actual store and paying 20 or even 40 bucks

2002
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,160
for one of these.

2003
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,400
Of course, not everything is so cheap.

2004
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:04,160
I mean some programs like iMovie is 15 bucks, Aperture 80 bucks, you know, but it's a way

2005
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:07,240
for them to sell, you know.

2006
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,840
So interesting.

2007
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,120
But what also is notable about this, hackers.

2008
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:16,600
You know the old saying, hackers gonna hack.

2009
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,240
So actually I just made up that saying.

2010
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,880
So now we have haters gonna hate and hackers gonna hack.

2011
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:26,440
Well, hackers gonna hack and they found the loophole in the Mac App Store.

2012
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:28,480
They pirated Angry Birds already.

2013
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,480
It took less than just a couple of days.

2014
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,880
Yep, that's it.

2015
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:37,000
Apparently all you have to do is like copy and paste this in-store purchase code and

2016
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,240
yeah, you can get the games for free.

2017
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:41,240
By the way, I love this.

2018
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:45,160
The name of the group that hacked the games, Hackulous.

2019
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:46,160
Get it?

2020
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,160
Like Tapulous?

2021
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:52,020
Well, Hackulous actually, they're responsible for the program Instalus which is what people

2022
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:56,800
used to download pirated games on the iPod.

2023
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:01,640
But I think, I keep thinking of like Tapulous who makes Tap Tap Revenge.

2024
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:04,000
That would be fun.

2025
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Alright.

2026
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,080
Alright, let's move on with some more stories, Dark Sakura.

2027
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:15,320
Well, for Monster Hunter fans, this is actually kind of neat, actually video game companies

2028
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:21,520
have been using different games to promote tourism in Japan.

2029
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:29,720
My Nietzsche Daily News actually reported that Shibu Hot Springs in Nagano actually

2030
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:36,600
worked with Capcom to have a Monster Hunter Portable 3 event go on because the town itself

2031
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:40,060
was similar to the one used in the game.

2032
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:45,040
And they had a lot of people go up, including people who said that they probably would have

2033
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:49,120
never gone had there not been the Monster Hunter event.

2034
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:53,760
And I've got a couple friends that live overseas who were totally into Monster Hunter and will

2035
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:57,520
go to the special Capcom events and camp out outside their offices and stuff.

2036
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,760
So, pretty crazy stuff.

2037
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:07,840
Konami did something similar for Love Plus, the Atami Onsen, so they did the same thing.

2038
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:19,080
And one was done, let me see if I can pronounce this right, Shakunage no Mori Botanical Park

2039
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:20,800
in Mimata.

2040
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,220
So they did something too.

2041
01:47:23,220 --> 01:47:28,000
That was for Kalanina Sekatsu Plus.

2042
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,300
The reason why I was excited to hear you talk about this story is because I want to beat

2043
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:35,640
the dead horse of when are we going to get a video game theme park?

2044
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:39,200
Like seriously, Angry Birds is super popular.

2045
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:43,480
Can't Angry Birds be a ride at a theme park now, even though I care less about the game?

2046
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:45,120
Can we get Angry Birds the ride?

2047
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:49,800
Can you imagine if you could go on a Mario Brothers roller coaster where as you're going

2048
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:54,920
up, imagine, can you know that part of California Screamin' where it goes up, down, up, down,

2049
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:55,920
up, down?

2050
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:56,920
Is that my favorite part?

2051
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:57,920
Yeah, a bunch of hills really fast.

2052
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:04,320
What should happen is at the top of every hill on the Mario coaster, bling, bling.

2053
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,840
Tell me they could not make an awesome theme park out of a video game.

2054
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:07,840
They could do it.

2055
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:11,360
I mean, I guess it would be all the licensing and so forth that would be a pain in the ass,

2056
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:14,320
but still, make it happen.

2057
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:16,440
They made a game in a theme park.

2058
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:17,440
The Toy Story game.

2059
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,440
Oh, that's true.

2060
01:48:18,440 --> 01:48:19,440
That was fun.

2061
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:20,440
That Toy Story game is awesome.

2062
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:25,400
And they are actually able to update it like an iPhone game or something with new levels

2063
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:26,400
and things like that.

2064
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,720
I haven't ridden it since Toy Story 3 came out, but I heard there's some newer stuff

2065
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:30,720
in there.

2066
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,720
Yeah, that was really fun.

2067
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:32,720
Keep surprised.

2068
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:34,480
And then the game came out.

2069
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:42,400
But yeah, we could totally have a mall taken over by zombies.

2070
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,400
Like a Dead Rising ride?

2071
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,400
Maybe.

2072
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:46,400
Perhaps.

2073
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,840
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

2074
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:52,440
Loki, what would you want to see in a video game theme park?

2075
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:54,680
I don't know.

2076
01:48:54,680 --> 01:49:01,960
I mean, I don't think it's really a good idea, actually.

2077
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:04,360
You don't think it's a good idea?

2078
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:05,560
Why not, hater?

2079
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:10,960
I guess it'd be fun to see, like, giant rabbit people dressed up as the giant rabbits or

2080
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,960
whatever.

2081
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,120
That'd be kind of funny.

2082
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:18,760
Or just imagine booth babes everywhere.

2083
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:23,560
So you're suggesting a Hooters theme park.

2084
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:24,800
They have a Hooters hotel.

2085
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:25,800
Why not?

2086
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:26,800
They do.

2087
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,560
It's the ugliest looking hotel I've ever seen.

2088
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:33,600
Can you imagine one of those station wagons with the wood grain paneling on the outside?

2089
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,080
Turned into a hotel.

2090
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:37,240
That would be the Hooters hotel.

2091
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:41,720
They have wood grain paneling on the outside of the hotel.

2092
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:44,320
Why?

2093
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,320
I don't know.

2094
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:46,320
Why?

2095
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,320
Because they're tacky.

2096
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:50,400
Alright, uh, let's move on to another story.

2097
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:52,280
Loki, what do you got for us?

2098
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:53,880
Ah, yes.

2099
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:55,560
Um, let's see.

2100
01:49:55,560 --> 01:50:05,720
We were talking a little bit about, um, um, some of the stuff for, uh, what was it, uh,

2101
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:12,800
Skyrim actually, um, the Elder Scrolls, ah, Elder Scrolls game.

2102
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:17,920
They were talking about some new stuff that's, um, available actually coming from the Game

2103
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:18,920
Informer magazine.

2104
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:21,560
They have a little piece on it in their new issue.

2105
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:26,600
Some of the differences are going to be in this game as compared to Oblivion, for example.

2106
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:30,560
Um, one is going to be the way that the game actually levels.

2107
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:35,200
The player's levels are now going to be more balanced, um, because I guess actually in

2108
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:39,960
the game, much like Fallout 3 and that kind of stuff, as you level up, the enemies level

2109
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:40,960
up as well.

2110
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:46,320
Well, in Oblivion, it got to the point where it was pretty damn impossible to be, um, able

2111
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:50,840
to go up against some of the enemies because they would just be leveling up with you.

2112
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:54,080
I don't like role-playing games where they level completely up with you.

2113
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:57,840
I think at some point you have to be able to overpower them a little bit.

2114
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:58,840
A little bit.

2115
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:03,960
I do agree that it should be a difficulty setting, if something like that.

2116
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:08,160
Um, anyways, they're going to have a, it's going to scale, you know, to the player's

2117
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:10,840
level, but it's going to be more balanced, they're saying.

2118
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:17,840
Um, it says, uh, foes will likely be easily bested by using, um, you know, some of the

2119
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:21,920
new features in the game, like dual-wielding, I guess is going to be a new feature that

2120
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:22,920
they're going to have.

2121
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:28,760
You can equip any item or spell to either hand using both simultaneously in combat.

2122
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:31,160
Um, so that's pretty cool.

2123
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:41,800
Um, and then of course, uh, they were saying that, um, I guess, uh, also the leveling system,

2124
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:46,400
they're saying, uh, no longer binds players to classifying by a set of skills.

2125
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:53,760
It says, players can pick and choose from the game's 18 abilities, um, which level up

2126
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:59,000
while using them simultaneously, unlocking perks with each level.

2127
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,600
So it basically sounds like it's going to be Fallout.

2128
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:05,520
And then they're also going to have, yeah, and then they're going to also include, uh,

2129
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:10,840
new weapon crafting systems, improved character creation tools, etc.

2130
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:14,920
And that's pretty cool, character creation-wise, because I believe they're, uh, their tools

2131
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:16,600
are pretty impressive in Oblivion.

2132
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:20,400
The only problem I found with Oblivion though, is I can create any character I want, as long

2133
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:25,440
as they were butt-fucking-ugly, because that's all that that, that tool creates, is really

2134
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:28,280
ugly-looking people.

2135
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:30,560
You know, the Fallout one isn't much better, to be honest.

2136
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:34,560
I don't know how much you've played around in Fallout 3, but, uh, a lot of the characters

2137
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,360
are, are fugs there too.

2138
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:38,440
So, sorry to say.

2139
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:42,760
Uh, by the way, SolarFlare reminds me in chat room, like FF8, Rob?

2140
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:45,920
Yes, exactly like that.

2141
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:51,800
Alright, um, one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to List List tonight.

2142
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:52,800
I'm so excited.

2143
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:53,800
I haven't even told you guys the topic.

2144
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:56,800
I think it's a fun topic tonight, but if you were paying attention earlier in the show,

2145
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,800
we dropped a hint.

2146
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:58,800
Yep.

2147
01:52:58,800 --> 01:52:59,800
So maybe you figured it out.

2148
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:02,480
And I finally got a guest for us, and it's an exciting guest that we haven't had on the

2149
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,480
show in a while.

2150
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:04,480
Yep.

2151
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:05,480
So, uh, we'll get to that in a minute.

2152
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:10,640
Uh, want to go to this story about EA pulling the plug on some old games.

2153
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:14,440
That's right, the servers are getting shut down for some old games, because that fee

2154
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:19,000
you pay to use Xbox Live, well, it doesn't pay to keep old shit running.

2155
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,800
Now, the good news is, most of this stuff is old sports games.

2156
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:26,000
You know, games that have been replaced with newer versions.

2157
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,280
For example, NCAA Basketball, 08 and 09, gone.

2158
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:36,760
NCAA Football, 07, 08, 09 in 2010, gone, at least the 2010 version on the PS2, specifically.

2159
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:39,280
NHL 08 and 09, they're out as well.

2160
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:41,660
So it's mostly old sports games.

2161
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:48,600
It also impacts series like Madden, Fight Night Round 3, FIFA, some of those games.

2162
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,640
But they weren't the only ones impacted.

2163
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:56,280
If you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings, the Battle for Middle Earth, 1 or 2 on PC,

2164
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:58,080
those servers are gone.

2165
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:03,440
Closing next week, Battle for Middle Earth 2 on Xbox 360, as well as the Rise of the

2166
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,700
Witch King, which I guess was the expansion.

2167
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:07,640
Not the Lich King, guys, the Witch King.

2168
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:08,640
There's a difference.

2169
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:13,720
Also, closing on January 17th, The Sims Carnival.

2170
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:17,440
So if you were a Sims Carnival fan, but there must not have been that many of you, because

2171
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:21,400
EA's shutting the server down, you will not be able to play anymore after January 17th.

2172
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:24,240
And there's this contingent out there going, there was a Sims Carnival?

2173
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:25,240
Exactly.

2174
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:29,740
Now, February 8th is when most of the sports games are scheduled to close.

2175
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:32,180
To be honest, this is nothing new.

2176
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:35,640
You know, it's always a bummer when it's games that aren't really sports games that upgrade

2177
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:39,080
every year, but, you know, it's kind of inevitable.

2178
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:43,160
And again, they feel like they can pull the plug because you're not playing them.

2179
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:47,000
But for those people that game on a budget and buy old games used, because, you know,

2180
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,320
you can get, like, last year's sports games super cheap.

2181
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:51,320
For a song.

2182
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:52,320
I know.

2183
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,320
It's super cheap.

2184
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:55,800
So, you know, budget gamers, that's a huge way they can kind of do it.

2185
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:59,040
Unfortunately, they don't get that same perk.

2186
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:02,760
Oh, well, what can you do?

2187
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,760
Guess what it's time for, guys?

2188
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:05,760
Party!

2189
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:09,000
Big American Party!

2190
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:15,520
It's time for Listless tonight, boys and girls.

2191
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:16,520
I'm so excited.

2192
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:17,520
We haven't done one of these in a while.

2193
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:22,960
The way Listless works, we are going to be forming the definitive list.

2194
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:25,440
And there is no arguing once this list is complete.

2195
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,680
This is a very scientific method.

2196
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:32,960
And it involves you guys in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

2197
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,400
We're going to bring in a fourth person to play along with us tonight.

2198
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:37,720
Let's get him on the line.

2199
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:42,880
I'll dumb down the music here while we give our friend a call.

2200
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:47,960
Now hopefully it works, because that would be a little embarrassing if it didn't work.

2201
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:52,040
But sometimes, you know, live show and connections can be a little bit spotty.

2202
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:53,040
Hello!

2203
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:54,040
Hi!

2204
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:55,040
Hi!

2205
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:57,880
Is this Breslul?

2206
01:55:57,880 --> 01:55:58,880
It usually is.

2207
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,880
Oh, lord, hang up, Rob.

2208
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:03,120
Long time no talk, my friend, how are you?

2209
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:04,120
I'm kidding, kidding.

2210
01:56:04,120 --> 01:56:05,520
Happy New Year, Dark Sakura.

2211
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:06,520
Jeez.

2212
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:07,520
I'm kidding.

2213
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:08,520
Heart, heart, heart, heart.

2214
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:11,120
What are your New Year's resolutions, Breslul?

2215
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:12,120
It doesn't matter.

2216
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:13,120
I've broken them all already.

2217
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:16,920
I did my first episode of USL, so those are all out the window.

2218
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:17,920
Congratulations.

2219
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:21,360
If you don't know Breslul, not only has he guessed it on the show a little bit in the

2220
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:22,360
past.

2221
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:23,360
Not so much lately, though, sadly.

2222
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,760
But that's because he's too busy doing another show.

2223
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:30,800
He's big time now, a host on Under Sedation Live, which is Saturday nights on the All

2224
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,400
Games Network.

2225
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:37,640
And with Iguana Girl, who's been on this show as well, Jessica Harper, Travis Donovan, who

2226
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:39,200
I'm afraid to have on this show.

2227
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:42,280
Oh, but Rob's never been on Under Sedation Live, has he?

2228
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:43,280
That's where I grew up.

2229
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,800
That was my old stomping grounds.

2230
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:48,440
Apparently, this is our 10th year doing it, and we didn't even realize it.

2231
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:49,440
Wow.

2232
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:53,180
And here I was talking about OLR celebrating the 400th episode.

2233
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:55,120
But you know, USL is taking a lot of breaks.

2234
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:56,520
I don't even know if they've gotten up to 400.

2235
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:57,520
I hate to say it, DMN.

2236
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:58,520
I don't know.

2237
01:56:58,520 --> 01:56:59,520
Whoa, hey.

2238
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,520
Blast from the past there.

2239
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:01,520
Oh, sorry, Breslul.

2240
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:02,520
Because I'm looking at...

2241
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:03,520
Never mind.

2242
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:06,800
I don't want to say, but I'm looking at something and it still says the old name.

2243
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:07,800
DDRFreak?

2244
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:08,800
No.

2245
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:09,800
Yes, I'm reading DDRFreak still.

2246
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:12,200
I was just looking at all the porn posts today.

2247
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:13,200
All right.

2248
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:18,200
Hey, I wanted to have you on specifically to talk about USL madness.

2249
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:19,440
Yes.

2250
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:22,960
We extended the deadline because not a lot of people submitted.

2251
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:29,280
Basically, what you do is you get a list of your 25 most favorite video games of all time.

2252
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:34,600
They can be as far back as Atari 2600 and television, and they can be as modern as Xbox

2253
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,460
360, PS3, PC.

2254
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:38,220
They can even be your favorite arcade games.

2255
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:42,640
We actually have had one nomination for Skee-Ball, believe it or not.

2256
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:43,640
Okay.

2257
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:44,640
Yeah.

2258
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:45,640
Good choice, actually.

2259
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:46,640
Skee-Ball's pretty awesome.

2260
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:50,100
But basically, what you do is you get that list together, order it from one to 25, one

2261
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:53,920
being Super Metroid, 25 being Minecraft or something.

2262
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:58,000
I like how you told everybody what to make their number ones.

2263
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Your number one, you're just going to put Super Metroid next to it because otherwise

2264
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
you're crazy.

2265
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Yeah.

2266
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,320
Then you submit those to uslmadness at gmail.com.

2267
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:09,000
Voting, actually, we extended it a week.

2268
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:14,120
It closes tonight at midnight Pacific, which is, if you're listening live, less than four

2269
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:15,120
hours from now.

2270
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:18,240
All right, procrastinators, I expect the live listeners to get cracking.

2271
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:19,620
Do you accept partial lists?

2272
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:24,040
What if somebody's like, I can't get to 25, but I've got 10, would you take that?

2273
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:29,600
I will do that, but those games won't get as good consideration as if you do a full

2274
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:30,600
list.

2275
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:36,080
So then you need to just throw in some bullshit, like Mappy, throw in... I was trying to get

2276
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:37,080
Dark Soccer.

2277
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:38,080
Elevator action!

2278
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,080
What's that?

2279
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:43,120
Some people have thrown out Minecraft, and Minecraft's currently in the top 30.

2280
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:44,120
Wow.

2281
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:45,120
Yeah.

2282
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:49,400
Minecraft's in the top 30, Pac-Man's in the top 30, Fallout might get a one seed this

2283
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:50,400
year.

2284
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,400
Wow.

2285
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:52,400
That's how nuts it is.

2286
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:53,400
Nice.

2287
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:55,480
Now, DDR Dollar Bill's in the chat room saying, fuck Minecraft.

2288
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:59,040
So DDR Dollar Bill, that means you better get your list in so you can bump Minecraft

2289
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:00,040
down a little bit.

2290
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:01,040
Yeah.

2291
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:03,320
And then we will announce the brackets sometime this coming week.

2292
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:07,080
All right, uslmadness at gmail.com.

2293
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:09,080
Super Metroid's a one seed, right?

2294
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:10,080
No.

2295
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,080
What?

2296
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:12,080
It's a two seed right now.

2297
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:13,080
What?

2298
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:14,080
Yeah, I know.

2299
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:18,120
This whole contest is a sham.

2300
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:19,480
I know your listeners are insane.

2301
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:20,480
I'm not sure which.

2302
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,480
All right, you ready to play listless with us tonight?

2303
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:23,480
I am.

2304
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:26,960
I actually have a list ready of something that I don't know anything about.

2305
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:27,960
All right.

2306
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:28,960
So here we go.

2307
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,600
Because I don't tell you the topics in advance.

2308
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,880
That would never happen in the magic of radio.

2309
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:33,880
All right.

2310
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:35,640
Let's tell the listeners already what the topic is.

2311
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:36,640
All right.

2312
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:39,840
If you were listening in part A, I said pay attention when Loki did the story about THQ

2313
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,720
and Mattel are entering a game deal, which means we might get a Masters of the Universe

2314
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:45,000
video game.

2315
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,080
So we thought, you know what we should do?

2316
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:52,080
Let's talk about toys that we think ought to be video games because, you know, if we

2317
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:56,240
limited it to just Mattel, I don't know what's Mattel and what's not, like Barbie's Mattel,

2318
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:57,240
right?

2319
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:58,240
I don't know.

2320
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:03,320
So we're going to just say toys in general, board games, whatever, anything you can find

2321
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:08,880
in the toy aisle at Target or Walmart or Toys R Us, I should say is fair game, except for

2322
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:09,960
like diapers.

2323
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:11,940
Like I don't think they should make a video game out of diapers.

2324
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:13,640
So if you guys have diapers on your list, please remove them.

2325
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:16,120
It has to be an actual marketed toy item.

2326
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:17,440
Yes, it needs to be a toy.

2327
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,160
So Babies R Us items don't count.

2328
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:20,160
All right, everybody.

2329
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:22,360
Now chat room, here's what you guys need to do.

2330
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:26,320
You need to start suggesting things in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com because

2331
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:31,080
if one of the hosts ends up duplicating something, we usually turn to chat to figure out how

2332
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:34,200
to fill in the gaps there.

2333
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:38,080
Also the chat plays a very important part in this because what's going to happen, we're

2334
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:42,160
going to go around and everybody's going to name their top three, myself, Loki Dark Sakura

2335
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:44,660
and Bresloh will each name their top three.

2336
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:48,260
Then each of us will go around and take one item off of the list.

2337
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:50,360
Something will not be worthy of the list.

2338
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:54,580
That will leave us with a list of eight and you guys in our chat room vote to come up

2339
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:56,080
with a definitive list of three.

2340
02:00:56,080 --> 02:01:00,600
I know that sounds really complicated you guys, but that's why it's a scientific process.

2341
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:02,160
Science is hard y'all.

2342
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:04,080
All right.

2343
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:05,080
Be careful guys.

2344
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:08,160
We're about to try science.

2345
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:10,000
She blinded me with science.

2346
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,440
All right, let's get into the list.

2347
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:14,000
Why don't we start tonight?

2348
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
How about Loki?

2349
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,360
I don't know how often you start in listless, but tonight you're starting this listless.

2350
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:22,200
What toy ought to be a video game?

2351
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:29,000
This is a terrible, terrible answer, but I'm going to do it anyways because it's simple.

2352
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
It's simple.

2353
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Ball.

2354
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Ball.

2355
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Ball.

2356
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Okay.

2357
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,200
Tell us how the game ball works.

2358
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:40,280
Really can be anything.

2359
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:43,640
You see balls are very versatile toys.

2360
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:46,760
You can play whatever games you want with them.

2361
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:47,760
Ball.

2362
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:52,920
Press A to bounce.

2363
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:56,640
It'd be like one of those reverse sandbox games or something.

2364
02:01:56,640 --> 02:02:02,160
It's Minecraft, but with balls.

2365
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:03,880
I can see the commercial now.

2366
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:05,280
Come play with our balls.

2367
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:06,480
All right.

2368
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:07,480
I'll go next.

2369
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:08,480
My number three choice.

2370
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:12,080
My number three choice for game or toy they should make into a game.

2371
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:15,160
Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven.

2372
02:02:15,160 --> 02:02:18,520
That was on my list and I removed it, Rob.

2373
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,620
All right.

2374
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:21,620
So Cooking Mama.

2375
02:02:21,620 --> 02:02:23,640
Wouldn't that be in the reverse though?

2376
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:24,720
What do you mean?

2377
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:30,840
They're like kind of making a video game into a toy.

2378
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:33,840
The toys already existed ever since I was a little girl.

2379
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:37,520
The Easy Bake Ovens have been around forever and now Cooking Mama is going to take that

2380
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:45,000
old toy and she's going to make fine cuisine with nothing but a light bulb.

2381
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
But no.

2382
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Don't worry, Bresl.

2383
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Mama will fix it.

2384
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,000
All right.

2385
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Oh God.

2386
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,720
You won't ever be eating poop in Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven.

2387
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:55,920
You might be eating mud pies though because I don't know.

2388
02:02:55,920 --> 02:03:00,240
Haven't they made Pooping Mama yet?

2389
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:03,440
There's Babysitting Mama where you have to change poopy diapers.

2390
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:04,880
I mean, you mean shake the baby?

2391
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:05,880
I mean, hi.

2392
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:06,880
All right.

2393
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:09,200
So Dark Sakura, what is your number three answer?

2394
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:10,520
Toy that ought to be a game.

2395
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,560
The erector set level building game.

2396
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:17,040
We have to build the whole thing out of erector sets and then you run your little guy through

2397
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:18,040
the erector set.

2398
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:19,040
Okay.

2399
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,680
Oh, it's kind of like a Lego game, but not because it's an erector set.

2400
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:22,680
Kind of a little big planet.

2401
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:26,000
Only you build the whole thing out of erector sets.

2402
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Wow.

2403
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
All right.

2404
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Well, screw chat.

2405
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,240
They're not given the answers that come on the show.

2406
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:32,240
You are, Bresl.

2407
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:34,440
It doesn't matter if chat took them.

2408
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:36,040
Here's my throwaway choice then.

2409
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:37,040
All right.

2410
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:38,040
Fine.

2411
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:39,040
Homies.

2412
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:40,840
Oh God.

2413
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:41,840
Little homies.

2414
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:42,840
Those little toys.

2415
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:43,840
The homies.

2416
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:44,840
Oh no.

2417
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:45,840
Yeah.

2418
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:46,840
I haven't seen those in forever.

2419
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:48,760
You want to hear something ironic?

2420
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,580
There was a little homies game.

2421
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:51,580
Was there?

2422
02:03:51,580 --> 02:03:52,580
Yes, there was.

2423
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:53,580
Wow.

2424
02:03:53,580 --> 02:03:54,580
Well, they need to do a better one.

2425
02:03:54,580 --> 02:03:56,900
What would the homies game be Bresl?

2426
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:57,900
I don't know.

2427
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,040
Saints Road 3.

2428
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,600
It was a kart racing game is what it was.

2429
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:02,880
Oh God.

2430
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:03,880
Screw that.

2431
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:04,880
They need to do it again.

2432
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:05,880
All right.

2433
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:08,960
I love some of the choices that are coming out in chat, by the way.

2434
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:09,960
All right.

2435
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:10,960
Number two pick.

2436
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,600
Loki, who brought us ball.

2437
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:17,800
What is your number two pick for Toy They Oughta Make Into a Video Game?

2438
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:20,840
If you say top, I'm coming down to Sacramento and punching you.

2439
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:21,840
The same what?

2440
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:22,840
Top.

2441
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:23,840
Top.

2442
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,840
No one plays at tops.

2443
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:26,840
No.

2444
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:27,840
Strag.

2445
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:28,840
No.

2446
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:29,840
No.

2447
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:30,840
My next one.

2448
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:37,480
I don't know if anyone remembers these, but they used to have these giant sets you could

2449
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:40,400
get called Marble Mat.

2450
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,720
It was Domino Rally.

2451
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:43,720
Fuck yes.

2452
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:44,720
Domino Rally.

2453
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:45,720
Domino Rally was awesome.

2454
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:50,320
Now granted, I know that they have a game called Domino Rally, Mr. Domino, but that's

2455
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:51,320
a different thing.

2456
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:52,320
No.

2457
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:53,320
Fuck Mr. Domino.

2458
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:54,320
I know it's tight.

2459
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,680
You're talking about dominoes that do loop-de-loops and all the crazy stunts, right?

2460
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,680
Yes.

2461
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,680
All right.

2462
02:04:57,680 --> 02:04:58,680
Yeah.

2463
02:04:58,680 --> 02:04:59,680
I support you there.

2464
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:00,680
You can build levels out of dominoes.

2465
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:01,680
Yeah.

2466
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:02,680
Awesome.

2467
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:03,680
I like that pick.

2468
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:04,680
Domino Rally is Logie's number two pick.

2469
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:05,680
I like that.

2470
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:12,360
My number two pick tonight, Light Bright Dance Dance Revolution.

2471
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:18,160
Because I can think of no better way to rave than with Light Bright.

2472
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:20,960
Use your Light Bright to throw sweet rave parties.

2473
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:21,960
Exactly.

2474
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:27,480
Sandstorm is already a confirmed song in Light Bright DDR, just so you all know.

2475
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:28,480
Oh God.

2476
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:30,080
It'd be awesome and you know it.

2477
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:34,880
It'd be rave and the kids would be getting high and playing their Light Bright DDR.

2478
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,520
All right.

2479
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:40,280
Dark Sakura, what is your number two choice for Toy They Oughta Make a Video Game?

2480
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:42,400
Bratz Doom.

2481
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:48,360
As in they're all the monsters and you have to go around shooting them with the BFG.

2482
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,120
Bratz in Doom.

2483
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:51,120
Bratz Doom.

2484
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:52,600
Bratz Doom.

2485
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:53,600
Shoot the Bratz.

2486
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:54,600
All right.

2487
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:56,320
I like that.

2488
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:59,320
Would the final level have Paula Abdul because she was involved with a movie.

2489
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:00,320
Or no, wait.

2490
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:01,320
She got fired from the movie, I think.

2491
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:04,560
Dude, you have to be a special kind of stupid to get fired from the Bratz movie.

2492
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:09,000
Or a special kind of high.

2493
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Wall Drugs.

2494
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
All right.

2495
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Loki.

2496
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
What is your...

2497
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

2498
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Not Loki.

2499
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Bresloh.

2500
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
So you guys are so the same.

2501
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
It's hard to tell you guys apart.

2502
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,400
One of you is sitting right here.

2503
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:20,400
All right.

2504
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:24,960
Bresloh, what is your number two choice for Toy They Oughta Make a Video Game?

2505
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:28,880
I really hope one of you three have heard of this board game, but I'm going to say Dominion.

2506
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:32,200
Haven't heard of it.

2507
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:33,760
What the hell is Dominion?

2508
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:37,320
It's basically a kind of reverse magic where you start out with a deck and there's a set

2509
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:41,920
of cards out and you pay money to buy cards and then use them later.

2510
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:45,360
It's kind of like Settlers of Catanesh.

2511
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:46,360
It's fun.

2512
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:48,240
And they should make it into an Xbox Live Arcade game.

2513
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:49,240
So Dominion.

2514
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:50,240
All right.

2515
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:51,240
I'll take your word for it.

2516
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:52,240
All right.

2517
02:06:52,240 --> 02:06:53,240
Cool story, bro.

2518
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:54,240
All right.

2519
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:55,240
Loki.

2520
02:06:55,240 --> 02:06:56,240
Cool story, bro.

2521
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:57,240
What's your number one...

2522
02:06:57,240 --> 02:06:58,240
Wait.

2523
02:06:58,240 --> 02:06:59,240
What's your number one call?

2524
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:07,320
Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set, Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally,

2525
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:10,920
Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, and Dominion.

2526
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:13,760
Loki, what is your number one pick?

2527
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:19,400
I'll take your Bratz Doom and I'll raise you Dead Rising Mole Madness.

2528
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:21,680
That's great.

2529
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:22,900
That's great.

2530
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:27,600
Not only do you have to fight off zombies, but you also have to find good deals on clothing

2531
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:31,160
and other couture.

2532
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:32,520
I really should have put that...

2533
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,920
What's that dating game called?

2534
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:37,160
I really should have put that on my list and I didn't.

2535
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:38,160
Girl Talk?

2536
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:39,160
Girl Talk.

2537
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:45,480
Actually, they have this really shitty looking game that I've seen at Target.

2538
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:46,580
It's something about like...

2539
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:48,700
It's called like Oops, That's the Truth or something.

2540
02:07:48,700 --> 02:07:50,240
What the hell is this game called?

2541
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:55,840
It's some type of like weird party game that they're selling as an Xbox 360 game.

2542
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:57,320
Oh, um...

2543
02:07:57,320 --> 02:07:58,320
Somebody's had to have heard of this.

2544
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:59,320
No, I know what you're talking about.

2545
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:00,880
It's the Truth or Lies?

2546
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:02,240
Yes, that game.

2547
02:08:02,240 --> 02:08:05,800
No, it's called Truth or Bargain Bit, actually.

2548
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:07,280
Exactly, very soon.

2549
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:08,960
Alright, my number one pick.

2550
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:12,420
I picked a serious one just like Breslöl did for his last one.

2551
02:08:12,420 --> 02:08:16,960
My serious number one answer, Millborn on Xbox Live Arcade.

2552
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:19,160
That would be pretty badass too.

2553
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:22,720
Millborn is like the best French card game ever made.

2554
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:27,660
It might be the only French card game ever made, but damn it, it's awesome.

2555
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:29,920
So Millborn, and if you have...

2556
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:32,400
The whole point of that game is to fuck your buddy.

2557
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:33,920
That's the whole point of the game.

2558
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:34,920
Awesome.

2559
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:37,640
I just gave us the explicit tag.

2560
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:38,640
Thank you very much.

2561
02:08:38,640 --> 02:08:39,640
Good night, everybody.

2562
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:40,640
You're welcome.

2563
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:43,000
That's why you're on this show tonight, to make sure we earn the explicit rating.

2564
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,900
So if you've never played Millborn, it's kind of like a racing game that you do at cards,

2565
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:49,220
and Breslöl is right.

2566
02:08:49,220 --> 02:08:53,640
You fuck your friends by puncturing their tires, getting them pulled over, making the

2567
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:54,920
green lights turn red.

2568
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:55,920
It's awesome.

2569
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:57,560
I love Millborn.

2570
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:58,560
Alright.

2571
02:08:58,560 --> 02:08:59,560
It's good.

2572
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:00,560
Let's see.

2573
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:01,560
Where are we going to next?

2574
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:02,560
How about Dark Soccer?

2575
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:03,560
What's your number one answer?

2576
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:09,040
My Little Pony Deathmatch.

2577
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:10,040
I think it should be...

2578
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:12,840
Like they bite and get rabies and stuff.

2579
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:16,320
I think it should be like Derby Owners Club, but with My Little Pony where you can whip

2580
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:17,760
the horses when they're bad.

2581
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:21,140
And whichever one is last gets shot.

2582
02:09:21,140 --> 02:09:24,040
Michael Vick presents My Little Pony Deathmatch.

2583
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:25,040
Okay.

2584
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:26,840
How about we call it...

2585
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:27,840
Here's the name.

2586
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:28,840
My Little...

2587
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:29,840
Death Race My Little Pony.

2588
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:30,840
Alright.

2589
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:34,920
And if you pre-order now, we'll give you a year's supply of Elmer's Glue.

2590
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:36,520
I was thinking that.

2591
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:37,520
Alright.

2592
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:41,000
Death Race My Little Pony is Dark Soccer's number one answer.

2593
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,520
Dark Soccer, I'm noticing a trend here.

2594
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:45,040
I think you have some anger issues.

2595
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:46,520
Somebody's homicidal tonight.

2596
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:47,520
Alright.

2597
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:50,640
Hello, what is your number one answer?

2598
02:09:50,640 --> 02:09:55,600
This was mentioned in the chat, and this is basically pong on crack in board game form.

2599
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:56,600
Crossfire.

2600
02:09:56,600 --> 02:10:00,120
Oh shit, I remember the commercials for those.

2601
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:02,400
That's the one where you have like all those steel balls, right?

2602
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:03,400
Yeah.

2603
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:04,400
And you shoot...

2604
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:07,560
My mother would never buy me that when I was growing up.

2605
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:08,560
She was a bitch.

2606
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:09,560
My mom wouldn't buy me that either.

2607
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:10,560
Alright.

2608
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,560
I love my mom.

2609
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:13,840
There was a pimple table that used that same thing called Hyper Ball.

2610
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:14,840
Really?

2611
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:15,840
Crossfire was awesome.

2612
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:17,520
All the little boys wanted one.

2613
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:18,520
Probably some of the girls, too.

2614
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:20,080
I bet Dark Soccer wanted Crossfire, too.

2615
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:21,480
Yeah, my mom wouldn't get it for me.

2616
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:22,480
Ah.

2617
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:23,480
But she got it for my brothers.

2618
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:24,480
Go figure.

2619
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:25,480
Our parents were all mean.

2620
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:27,600
Loki, did your parents buy you Crossfire?

2621
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:30,560
I didn't want it, but I got to play it, and it was fun.

2622
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:31,560
Not pointless.

2623
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:32,560
One moment.

2624
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:35,360
Shoot a bunch of balls at this other thing with a ball in the middle.

2625
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:38,040
You alright, Bresloh?

2626
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:41,560
Bresloh needed to put the show on hold for a minute so he could tend to some business.

2627
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:43,560
BRB, poopin'.

2628
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:47,520
Alright, well here's the list of sustains right now.

2629
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:54,280
Ball, Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally,

2630
02:10:54,280 --> 02:11:01,240
Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dominion, Dead Rising Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade,

2631
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:04,600
Death Race My Little Pony, and Crossfire.

2632
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:05,720
This is hard.

2633
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:07,400
We have to eliminate some of these from the list.

2634
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:08,400
I don't know if I can.

2635
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:11,000
Alright, but we got, that's how it works.

2636
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,320
So Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2637
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:15,320
Homies.

2638
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:18,040
It's already got a game in it, it's crap.

2639
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:19,280
Homies is gone.

2640
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,000
Bresloh's back from his poop.

2641
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Welcome back.

2642
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Alright.

2643
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:26,400
Let's see, my turn.

2644
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:27,400
This is hard.

2645
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:29,680
I don't want to eliminate any of these.

2646
02:11:29,680 --> 02:11:32,760
I'm sorry, I hate to do this because I know the chatters probably love this one.

2647
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:36,600
I've got to eliminate ball because I just don't get it.

2648
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:39,560
What is the game?

2649
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:41,600
That sounds like a tech demo to me, so I'm sorry.

2650
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:43,720
Ball has been stricken from the list.

2651
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:46,000
Dark Sakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2652
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,200
Only for lack of familiarity, Dominion.

2653
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:49,200
Aww.

2654
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:54,200
Poor Bresloh got two of them yanked from the list, but that's okay, Bresloh, because you're

2655
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:57,680
obviously not going to eliminate your own, so you get at least one on there.

2656
02:11:57,680 --> 02:12:00,800
Bresloh, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2657
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,800
I'm going to eliminate Crossfire, I mean Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven.

2658
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:05,800
Aww.

2659
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:09,160
Why are you eliminating Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven?

2660
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:15,120
Because only on the guarantee that my Xbox will spit out delicious treats, which I don't

2661
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:17,920
think that technology is quite there yet.

2662
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:21,360
Not yet, not until we get the holodeck and how it makes food and everything.

2663
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:24,160
All right, so here's the list that our chatters are going to vote on.

2664
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:27,640
You're going to vote for your number one and number two pick, and you're going to send

2665
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:30,720
them over a private message to Skye in the chat room.

2666
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:33,800
Please label your number one and your number two choices, or I'm going to assume what you

2667
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:37,320
list first is number one and what you list second is number two.

2668
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:39,440
So here is the...

2669
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:40,520
You all right Bresloh?

2670
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:41,520
You need a minute?

2671
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:45,280
All right, so here is the list as it stands right now.

2672
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:51,640
Erector Set Level Building Game, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dead Rising

2673
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:57,640
Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade, Death Race My Little Pony, and Crossfire.

2674
02:12:57,640 --> 02:13:03,240
Chatters, it's now in your hands to come up with a definitive list of the top three toys

2675
02:13:03,240 --> 02:13:04,840
that need to be video games.

2676
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:10,320
And while you're at it, Bresloh, repeat the March Madness email.

2677
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:11,320
I will do that.

2678
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:15,140
It is uslmadnessatgmail.com.

2679
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:21,000
You have about three and a half hours to get those submissions in if you're listening on

2680
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
the podcast.

2681
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:27,960
I'm sorry, the expiration has gone past, but we will have voting up probably by the time

2682
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:30,040
you're listening to this.

2683
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:33,560
And I noticed that somebody in studio just sent you an email.

2684
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:37,240
I think I already did one before, but I did it again just to be safe.

2685
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:41,600
I don't think I got one from you, but I'm assuming that it now rides with Woklockera,

2686
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:42,600
so...

2687
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:45,600
You might be right, actually.

2688
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,600
All right.

2689
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:47,600
Yeah.

2690
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:48,600
So there you go.

2691
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:50,040
Thank you so much for playing our dumb little game tonight, Bresloh.

2692
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:51,120
We really appreciate it.

2693
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:54,680
Best of luck with uslmadness and everything that goes on at Understation Live.

2694
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:56,960
Tell the others we said hi.

2695
02:13:56,960 --> 02:14:00,460
Tell Iguana Girl I'd like to go see another D-Box movie with her at some point and have

2696
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:01,460
Pink Bird.

2697
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:02,460
Okay.

2698
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,460
All right.

2699
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:04,460
One more thing?

2700
02:14:04,460 --> 02:14:05,460
Yes?

2701
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:06,460
Yeah.

2702
02:14:06,460 --> 02:14:07,460
You hung up.

2703
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:08,460
Ass.

2704
02:14:08,460 --> 02:14:09,460
Dude.

2705
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:10,460
You ass.

2706
02:14:10,460 --> 02:14:11,460
They have Ninja Legos now.

2707
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:12,460
Place your vote, by the way.

2708
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:13,460
Right now.

2709
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:14,460
Send your number one and your number two choices.

2710
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:18,160
You have until the end of the mailbag segment to get those votes in, and I'll tell you a

2711
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:19,160
spoiler.

2712
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:22,120
There's not a lot of emails tonight, so hurry, hurry, hurry.

2713
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:23,640
But let's see what is in the email bag.

2714
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:29,040
We're going to open it up right now, folks.

2715
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:32,820
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send us your emails every week.

2716
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:34,280
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2717
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:37,120
Dark Soccer is going to jump in the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite

2718
02:14:37,120 --> 02:14:38,120
emails for you all.

2719
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:39,540
How about the one email we got?

2720
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:40,540
One email?

2721
02:14:40,540 --> 02:14:41,540
Holy shit.

2722
02:14:41,540 --> 02:14:42,540
It's a big in, though.

2723
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:43,540
You better get those votes in now.

2724
02:14:43,540 --> 02:14:49,360
Well, it actually is from Rababa, picking apart an Ars Technica story about Nintendo

2725
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:52,240
warning about the 3D for young gamers.

2726
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:54,800
So I'm going to read the email as is.

2727
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:59,880
First they claim that eye growth as literally translated may be harmed according to a warning

2728
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:01,480
statement for the 3DS.

2729
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:05,400
They state that it isn't about actual growth, but rather perception.

2730
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:11,300
The concern is that the portions of our visual system that reside in the brain are adaptive.

2731
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:15,120
They adjust to information we receive and can remap connections in order to operate

2732
02:15:15,120 --> 02:15:17,320
more efficiently on a typical input.

2733
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:21,280
This is especially true in infants as the visual system is still developing at the earliest

2734
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:22,280
stages of life.

2735
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:23,280
Which is true.

2736
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:29,120
Babies can't see much of anything for the first few weeks, except blurs.

2737
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:33,920
This ability to rewire our visual system on the fly is behind the 3D health concerns.

2738
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:39,040
I actually don't know if what they state is true, but it does seem made up to me.

2739
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:42,520
I wish it said according to this article in the Lancet or the like.

2740
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:43,520
I wish it...

2741
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:47,560
And I find it odd that they forget about the common eye disorder, lazy eye, where muscles

2742
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:51,040
in one eye don't grow, causing a seemingly cross eye.

2743
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:55,360
This treatment is remarkably simple, wearing an eye patch to exercise the weaker eye.

2744
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:58,760
I always assumed the warning was for conditions like lazy eye.

2745
02:15:58,760 --> 02:15:59,760
What do you think?

2746
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:04,960
Also, isn't the warning more about what we don't know about simulated 3D effects?

2747
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:08,600
I'm sure that there will also be warnings to stop using 3D if you develop nausea or

2748
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:09,600
headache.

2749
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:12,320
Either way, it must be better than the red-blue 3D.

2750
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:13,640
Later, Ra-ba-ba.

2751
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:17,440
Sigh and magenta.

2752
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:21,080
You know, and I think we got into this a little bit last week on the show with the disclaimer,

2753
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:25,320
but you know, I think it's just Nintendo kind of overcompensating a little bit, where it's

2754
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:28,600
just that we live in a soo-happy society.

2755
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:29,600
They're covering their ass.

2756
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:34,640
Yeah, and I think a kid would have to play these games for a very long time.

2757
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:39,200
But I'll admit, when I was playing the 3DS, I did feel that little pull on my eyes.

2758
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:42,320
But you know, when it got to me, I just would turn the slider off.

2759
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:46,240
So it's really about just kind of knowing your limits, I suppose, and knowing when to

2760
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:47,240
turn that off.

2761
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:50,920
Now, I guess a child wouldn't really know their limits, but that's why parents have

2762
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:55,080
to supervise you guys.

2763
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:59,120
So I don't know, I don't know what else to say on that.

2764
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:00,120
Anything else for that email?

2765
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:01,120
DarkSagra?

2766
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:02,120
Nope.

2767
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:03,120
Wow.

2768
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:04,120
Alright.

2769
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:05,120
I'm still tallying cage match votes.

2770
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:06,120
Well...

2771
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:07,120
Listless votes?

2772
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,720
Sorry, that's what I meant.

2773
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:09,720
Listless votes.

2774
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:10,720
Cage matches for after.

2775
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:11,720
Yeah, sorry.

2776
02:17:11,720 --> 02:17:12,720
My bad.

2777
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:13,720
Listless votes.

2778
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:14,720
I'm still tabulating right now.

2779
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:17,440
And two of these have very similar names that I keep mistaking.

2780
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:21,120
See, I just gave one a vote that I shouldn't have, because it was a vote for Death Race,

2781
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:22,120
not Dead Rising.

2782
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:23,120
Dead!

2783
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:24,120
Alright.

2784
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:27,440
This is the very, very last call.

2785
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:30,520
If you don't get those votes in now, they may not count, because we have to move into

2786
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:32,140
the FUs of the week.

2787
02:17:32,140 --> 02:17:37,280
It's the part of the show where we get angsty.

2788
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:52,840
FU to my hip.

2789
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:56,640
For hurting like a motherfucker all week.

2790
02:17:56,640 --> 02:17:58,440
And keeping me from doing fun things.

2791
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:04,080
However, I have leveled quite a bit in World of Warcraft, and FU did that too.

2792
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:05,080
Loki?

2793
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:07,080
Um, FU to my shoulder.

2794
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:11,640
I must have slept on it weird or something last night, because it's been hurting the

2795
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:15,020
hell out of me today, so that really sucks.

2796
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:18,160
Are you sure that your child hasn't learned how to climb out of the crib and come chew

2797
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:19,160
on your shoulder?

2798
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:20,160
No.

2799
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:22,240
He tried to eat my nose last night, though, so it's possible.

2800
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:23,240
All babies are always sticking things in their mouths.

2801
02:18:23,240 --> 02:18:26,360
I don't know if you saw the picture on Facebook Nellie posted.

2802
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:27,360
That picture was great.

2803
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:32,020
It was like some de- he just like all of a sudden started attacking my nose, it was funny.

2804
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:33,020
It's something!

2805
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:34,020
Bite!

2806
02:18:34,020 --> 02:18:36,640
These babies are cute.

2807
02:18:36,640 --> 02:18:40,280
Until they get three and decide to jump on you and break your back.

2808
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:42,160
And then they're still cute.

2809
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:49,800
Yeah, the way that I hurt my hip is catching Becky's son Julian, because now he's falling

2810
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:52,360
with style on top of people.

2811
02:18:52,360 --> 02:18:57,560
Like in Toy Story, anyway.

2812
02:18:57,560 --> 02:19:03,660
All right, my FU of the week goes to, um, people that are always negative all the time.

2813
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:07,160
People that just live in this negative little world with their negative little comments,

2814
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:09,320
they never have anything good to say.

2815
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:12,320
Geez, Rob, you're complaining a lot.

2816
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:13,320
Shut up!

2817
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:14,320
That was negative, too!

2818
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:15,320
No, but I'm serious.

2819
02:19:15,320 --> 02:19:20,760
It's like, I just say there's, there's certain fun things that I like to do and the amount

2820
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:23,660
of negativity surrounding them is starting to suck the fun out of it.

2821
02:19:23,660 --> 02:19:24,660
And it really is.

2822
02:19:24,660 --> 02:19:27,140
It's nothing any of you are involved with, don't worry about it.

2823
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:30,900
So it's kind of one of those things where I'm like starting to get to my wits end and

2824
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:34,980
it's kind of like I, I might have to give it up because it's not fun anymore.

2825
02:19:34,980 --> 02:19:35,980
I get it.

2826
02:19:35,980 --> 02:19:36,980
It's a bummer.

2827
02:19:36,980 --> 02:19:37,980
It's nothing to do with podcasting, y'all.

2828
02:19:37,980 --> 02:19:38,980
Don't start rumors.

2829
02:19:38,980 --> 02:19:39,980
Or Warcraft.

2830
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:40,980
So it's just frustrating.

2831
02:19:40,980 --> 02:19:41,980
Yeah.

2832
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:42,980
Anyhow, drama.

2833
02:19:42,980 --> 02:19:50,420
There's always drama somewheres, but let's, let's make things a little bit happier and

2834
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:53,460
get into the listless results.

2835
02:19:53,460 --> 02:19:54,460
Yay!

2836
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:56,460
Results of tonight's listless.

2837
02:19:56,460 --> 02:19:57,540
This is it.

2838
02:19:57,540 --> 02:19:58,800
This is the definitive list.

2839
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:02,060
You guys, Oh, we've got a late vote.

2840
02:20:02,060 --> 02:20:03,820
I almost would not let this count.

2841
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:06,460
However, I don't think it's going to change the final result here.

2842
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:08,020
No, it does not.

2843
02:20:08,020 --> 02:20:09,020
All right.

2844
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:10,580
The top three, and this is it guys.

2845
02:20:10,580 --> 02:20:11,800
There is no disputing.

2846
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:15,660
These are the three games you want to see them make out of toys.

2847
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:18,060
Number three tonight, and it was a close one.

2848
02:20:18,060 --> 02:20:21,180
Number three tonight was death race.

2849
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:22,180
My little pony.

2850
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:23,180
Yay.

2851
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:27,860
We want those ponies to fight to the death.

2852
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:34,780
Your number two pick for game you most want to see them make out of an old toy, Crossfire.

2853
02:20:34,780 --> 02:20:35,780
That's going to be interesting.

2854
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:36,780
I don't know how that would be a video game.

2855
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:37,780
You should find the commercial for Crossfire, Rob.

2856
02:20:37,780 --> 02:20:39,580
Didn't it have like a catchy little theme song to it?

2857
02:20:39,580 --> 02:20:40,580
I think it did.

2858
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:41,580
Hold on.

2859
02:20:41,580 --> 02:20:42,580
Let me put that in and chat.

2860
02:20:42,580 --> 02:20:43,580
Let me see if I can YouTube it real quick.

2861
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:44,580
Here.

2862
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:45,580
Hold on.

2863
02:20:45,580 --> 02:20:54,340
It was retarded and funny at the same time and it like had this like red and blue background.

2864
02:20:54,340 --> 02:20:55,340
Hold on.

2865
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:56,340
Hold on kids.

2866
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:57,340
Here we go.

2867
02:20:57,340 --> 02:20:58,340
Coming soon to a video game store near you.

2868
02:20:58,340 --> 02:21:27,100
The ultimate challenge, Crossfire.

2869
02:21:27,100 --> 02:21:28,660
I found one of those at a thrift store.

2870
02:21:28,660 --> 02:21:29,860
God, the eighties were amazing.

2871
02:21:29,860 --> 02:21:32,220
Rob, with the label on it, missing balls.

2872
02:21:32,220 --> 02:21:35,140
It was like a year ago.

2873
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:36,620
This game has no balls.

2874
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:37,780
All right.

2875
02:21:37,780 --> 02:21:43,140
And the number one game or sorry, number one toy you most want to see turned into a game.

2876
02:21:43,140 --> 02:21:44,140
Come on.

2877
02:21:44,140 --> 02:21:45,140
You guys know our audience.

2878
02:21:45,140 --> 02:21:46,140
What is it?

2879
02:21:46,140 --> 02:21:48,140
Light, bright DDR.

2880
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:49,140
Yay.

2881
02:21:49,140 --> 02:21:53,420
Everyone get out the E in the sandstorm.

2882
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:54,980
Everyone rave.

2883
02:21:54,980 --> 02:21:55,980
Coming soon.

2884
02:21:55,980 --> 02:21:56,980
Hugs.

2885
02:21:56,980 --> 02:21:57,980
Everybody hugs.

2886
02:21:57,980 --> 02:21:58,980
Hugs.

2887
02:21:58,980 --> 02:22:01,900
I made some candy cause you're my friend.

2888
02:22:01,900 --> 02:22:04,380
You guys let's hug.

2889
02:22:04,380 --> 02:22:07,060
Can we cuddle?

2890
02:22:07,060 --> 02:22:08,580
And then there's the make out room.

2891
02:22:08,580 --> 02:22:11,660
No, it's the, it's the cuddle room.

2892
02:22:11,660 --> 02:22:12,660
It's not the make out room.

2893
02:22:12,660 --> 02:22:14,100
Oh, you know, that's what it's going to turn into.

2894
02:22:14,100 --> 02:22:17,640
Did you ever go to like, I want to say you went to one, like I still remember we both

2895
02:22:17,640 --> 02:22:18,640
went to one or something.

2896
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:26,820
No, I went to a roller skate rave and really, well we got permission to.

2897
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:32,900
We rented, this is in Alabama, mind you, we rented a roller rink and my roommate at the

2898
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:40,280
time DJ'd the whole thing and it was like, like the, the dance music of that day, like

2899
02:22:40,280 --> 02:22:45,500
Psychosonic and Tracy Lords and Moby and all of that cause you know Tracy Lords did her

2900
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:46,500
stint as a DJ.

2901
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:47,500
I love Tracy Lords.

2902
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:48,500
I'm not even going to lie.

2903
02:22:48,500 --> 02:22:49,500
Oh yeah.

2904
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:58,020
Um, you know, and a sunscreen and all of those, you know, uh, mid nineties dance music and

2905
02:22:58,020 --> 02:23:03,380
there was activities going on in the outside cause we couldn't do anything inside the rink.

2906
02:23:03,380 --> 02:23:09,460
Sorry, we needed a soundtrack to this, but we had people in various states of intoxication

2907
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:11,540
on roller skates.

2908
02:23:11,540 --> 02:23:12,540
It was amazing.

2909
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:15,300
Loki, did you ever go to a rave when you were younger?

2910
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:22,180
Um, no, but I had to clean up a rave and that's not, not much fun.

2911
02:23:22,180 --> 02:23:32,660
Apparently they, they got the good idea to, um, host a rave at the Cuzar and most people,

2912
02:23:32,660 --> 02:23:41,420
I guess there was an orgy on the T-MEC machine and there was also an orgy on the, uh, hard

2913
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:43,740
driving machine, I think.

2914
02:23:43,740 --> 02:23:45,500
The nap machine.

2915
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:50,020
Anyways so they had that, but people started having an orgy in the hard drive and I don't

2916
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:51,020
know.

2917
02:23:51,020 --> 02:23:52,020
I wasn't there.

2918
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:56,220
Um, but anyways, see people were paying money to go inside the arena.

2919
02:23:56,220 --> 02:23:58,540
They weren't even really playing laser tag.

2920
02:23:58,540 --> 02:24:01,900
They were just staring at the colors from all the black lights.

2921
02:24:01,900 --> 02:24:06,860
So uh, yeah, I missed out on that unfortunately, but I got to come in and clean it up afterwards

2922
02:24:06,860 --> 02:24:07,860
and that sucked.

2923
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:08,860
How exciting for you.

2924
02:24:08,860 --> 02:24:10,600
I went to, I went to two raves.

2925
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:13,380
I had a really good friend of mine when I was younger was really into the whole rave

2926
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:16,340
thing and one of them was kind of dumb.

2927
02:24:16,340 --> 02:24:17,660
Like I didn't have a good time at that rave.

2928
02:24:17,660 --> 02:24:21,580
It was, it was like a house that was like a recording studio that whatever.

2929
02:24:21,580 --> 02:24:25,540
Keep in mind y'all, I went to school in Chico, California, which is like party central.

2930
02:24:25,540 --> 02:24:28,100
Like everything you've read about, about Chico being a party school.

2931
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:29,100
Totally true.

2932
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:34,620
So uh, yeah, so that rave was kind of dopey, but the other one was like an outdoor kind

2933
02:24:34,620 --> 02:24:35,620
of thing.

2934
02:24:35,620 --> 02:24:38,740
I don't even know where it was cause I wasn't watching where we were driving and I had a

2935
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:39,740
lot of fun.

2936
02:24:39,740 --> 02:24:40,740
I have to, I'm not going to lie.

2937
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:44,300
I had a lot, you know, for being like the E for being 20 I didn't do any of that.

2938
02:24:44,300 --> 02:24:48,660
And actually everybody really respected my wishes to not get into doing to any of that.

2939
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:50,260
But um, I'm not going to lie.

2940
02:24:50,260 --> 02:24:54,780
Um, there was this guy who I think might've had some of the substances was really hot

2941
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:55,940
and we just made out all night.

2942
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:59,420
Like I didn't, I didn't need nothing to get me in the mood.

2943
02:24:59,420 --> 02:25:00,420
I'm like, you're hot.

2944
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:02,260
That's drug enough for me.

2945
02:25:02,260 --> 02:25:04,460
Oh Rob.

2946
02:25:04,460 --> 02:25:05,460
So that was the day.

2947
02:25:05,460 --> 02:25:08,500
And then actually I kissed a girl at that same wave.

2948
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:10,580
I know because she's okay.

2949
02:25:10,580 --> 02:25:12,420
This has nothing to do with games, but I don't even care.

2950
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:13,740
This is funny.

2951
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:19,200
She took this book or she had this book of everybody she'd ever made out with was in

2952
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:20,620
this book.

2953
02:25:20,620 --> 02:25:26,560
And uh, she was on page 67 and I said, I want to be page 69 in your book.

2954
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:28,260
Like I have to like, this is my new goal.

2955
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:30,100
I want to be page 69 in your book.

2956
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:33,540
And she's like, well, I'll make out with you, but I have to have 68 first.

2957
02:25:33,540 --> 02:25:36,500
So I was like, you make out with her.

2958
02:25:36,500 --> 02:25:41,260
And so she made out with this random guy and then made out with me.

2959
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:45,380
And then, uh, I was number 69 and then this is so terrible.

2960
02:25:45,380 --> 02:25:47,080
You guys don't do this at home.

2961
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:52,000
Then we decided we were all three going to kiss and that's when I got introduced to three

2962
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,820
way kissing, which is really weird.

2963
02:25:53,820 --> 02:26:03,720
Yeah, it's, it's, there's certain things I can't say with my husband and the other.

2964
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:07,220
So that was my, um, raving experience.

2965
02:26:07,220 --> 02:26:12,180
So it was a good time, you know, I've, I've just done the wrong and silly and you know

2966
02:26:12,180 --> 02:26:13,180
what it was.

2967
02:26:13,180 --> 02:26:14,180
It wasn't sex.

2968
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:15,180
It was just kissing.

2969
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:16,180
I've done the roller rave.

2970
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:17,180
Yeah.

2971
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:22,780
The roller rave was fun cause I drank a lot of beer and I can roller skate drunk.

2972
02:26:22,780 --> 02:26:25,780
Alrighty, let's move on.

2973
02:26:25,780 --> 02:26:28,660
Do not drink and roller skate.

2974
02:26:28,660 --> 02:26:30,940
It is a bigger disaster than drinking and driving.

2975
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:34,340
Let's try to get back into some actual video game news.

2976
02:26:34,340 --> 02:26:35,340
I don't know.

2977
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:36,740
Unless Loki wants to talk about three way kissing.

2978
02:26:36,740 --> 02:26:40,300
I don't know, but I have no experience in that I'm afraid.

2979
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:42,300
Well then I guess we'll have to go back to video game news.

2980
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:49,380
I guess we're going to have to, um, so there was concern with, uh, harmonics being sold

2981
02:26:49,380 --> 02:26:54,860
by, uh, MTV, you know, who was going to buy them, you know, was it going to be Activision?

2982
02:26:54,860 --> 02:26:59,860
God, let's hope it's not Activision, but, uh, ironically enough, no one ever thought

2983
02:26:59,860 --> 02:27:03,900
harmonics may buy harmonics and that's what happened.

2984
02:27:03,900 --> 02:27:10,940
Um, apparently our harmonics, um, they've been purchased and they have a investment

2985
02:27:10,940 --> 02:27:11,940
group.

2986
02:27:11,940 --> 02:27:14,940
Uh, Columbus Nova also, um, took part in that.

2987
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:19,860
They purchased them for $49 and 99 cents plus whatever debt they had.

2988
02:27:19,860 --> 02:27:28,700
So, um, apparently they're going to, um, you know, take on their debts and stuff.

2989
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:35,420
But, uh, harmonics will assume, uh, responsibility over its liabilities and also, um, includes,

2990
02:27:35,420 --> 02:27:40,900
um, music rights, fees, and responsibilities for lots of unsold games and equipment sitting

2991
02:27:40,900 --> 02:27:42,420
on warehouse shelves.

2992
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:49,100
Also, they're going to be able to, um, keep the rights to Rock Band and Dent Central.

2993
02:27:49,100 --> 02:27:51,820
And, um, we'll have control over those franchises.

2994
02:27:51,820 --> 02:27:54,020
So that's kind of cool.

2995
02:27:54,020 --> 02:27:56,140
And Viacom's not doing too bad out of it.

2996
02:27:56,140 --> 02:28:02,020
Apparently the sale will reportedly net Viacom $150 million in tax benefits and, uh, you

2997
02:28:02,020 --> 02:28:05,820
know, considering it spent $175 million to buy the company in the first place, that's

2998
02:28:05,820 --> 02:28:06,820
not bad.

2999
02:28:06,820 --> 02:28:07,820
Wow.

3000
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:12,940
So they're going to, uh, write off essentially on their taxes this year, Viacom, or I mean,

3001
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:13,940
I, uh, harmonics.

3002
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:15,740
Viacom will write them off.

3003
02:28:15,740 --> 02:28:16,740
Wow.

3004
02:28:16,740 --> 02:28:17,740
Crazy.

3005
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:22,620
I just hope that they can get the backing that they'll need to keep up, uh, with, you

3006
02:28:22,620 --> 02:28:24,700
know, production and licensing and everything.

3007
02:28:24,700 --> 02:28:29,700
Where's the commercial on YouTube that's all QVC style where you can buy a video game publishing

3008
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:35,000
company for $49.99 and the chicks who have no idea what they're talking about trying

3009
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
to explain it.

3010
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:39,160
Have you ever watched them sell video games on QVC?

3011
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:40,340
It makes my brain hurt.

3012
02:28:40,340 --> 02:28:41,860
It's so awesomely bad.

3013
02:28:41,860 --> 02:28:43,380
I don't watch TV, Rob.

3014
02:28:43,380 --> 02:28:44,380
Oh my God.

3015
02:28:44,380 --> 02:28:45,380
That should be a segment on our show.

3016
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:46,380
I just watch Supernatural.

3017
02:28:46,380 --> 02:28:47,720
We're hard up for new segments on our show.

3018
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:53,080
We need to start doing like QVC selling video games because it's, it's hilarious how bad

3019
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:54,180
they are.

3020
02:28:54,180 --> 02:29:00,180
This game is called Shock Troopers and I think it's about getting electrocuted in the jungle

3021
02:29:00,180 --> 02:29:02,300
while you're shooting guns.

3022
02:29:02,300 --> 02:29:03,300
Yeah.

3023
02:29:03,300 --> 02:29:07,700
This is a really fun game for the whole family.

3024
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:09,900
And this game is called Resident Evil.

3025
02:29:09,900 --> 02:29:11,260
It's not bloody at all.

3026
02:29:11,260 --> 02:29:12,660
There's no zombies.

3027
02:29:12,660 --> 02:29:16,260
For you auto aficionados out here, Grand Theft Auto is perfect for you.

3028
02:29:16,260 --> 02:29:19,340
It has lots of cars in it and hookers.

3029
02:29:19,340 --> 02:29:22,900
I want to see really quick.

3030
02:29:22,900 --> 02:29:24,260
Do they have any on YouTube?

3031
02:29:24,260 --> 02:29:25,260
Hold on.

3032
02:29:25,260 --> 02:29:27,340
You know they've got everything on YouTube, Rob.

3033
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:29,620
You're not going to have a problem.

3034
02:29:29,620 --> 02:29:32,020
Although if you don't find anything, I will be surprised.

3035
02:29:32,020 --> 02:29:36,660
And there was the one, the guy who broke the TV with the Wiimote on QVC.

3036
02:29:36,660 --> 02:29:37,660
Really?

3037
02:29:37,660 --> 02:29:40,660
That was pretty funny.

3038
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:45,300
Um, QVC Phineas and Ferb motion video game.

3039
02:29:45,300 --> 02:29:48,500
Phineas and Ferb is awesome.

3040
02:29:48,500 --> 02:29:52,340
I don't, this isn't actually a clip from QVC though.

3041
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:53,340
I don't know.

3042
02:29:53,340 --> 02:29:54,340
Sadly I don't.

3043
02:29:54,340 --> 02:29:55,340
Good chat room.

3044
02:29:55,340 --> 02:29:56,340
You need to find me one so I can play it here on the show.

3045
02:29:56,340 --> 02:29:57,340
Okay.

3046
02:29:57,340 --> 02:29:58,340
We got one more story for you guys.

3047
02:29:58,340 --> 02:30:03,620
Then we're going to open up the, uh, uh, 877 number 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype

3048
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:04,620
is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3049
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:10,820
Ooh, actually I need to make sure that, uh, the 800 number is still working because, uh,

3050
02:30:10,820 --> 02:30:13,740
it actually may have ran out tonight and I forgot to recharge it.

3051
02:30:13,740 --> 02:30:16,700
So you may only be able to get us on Skype tonight at OrangeLoungeRadio, but I'll try

3052
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:17,700
in a minute here.

3053
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:22,060
Uh, first off though, we've got to get to news about the new Silent Hill.

3054
02:30:22,060 --> 02:30:26,160
There's a new Silent Hill game coming and it's called, not Silent Hill 8, it's called

3055
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:28,100
Silent Hill Downpour.

3056
02:30:28,100 --> 02:30:29,260
Yep.

3057
02:30:29,260 --> 02:30:32,100
That's the new name of the game, Silent Hill Downpour.

3058
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:35,360
There's new information about this game in the latest Game Informer.

3059
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:39,100
Apparently the town is huge and you're going to use a subway system to get from one parts

3060
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:40,460
of the town to another.

3061
02:30:40,460 --> 02:30:44,500
There's going to be a never before seen Southeastern side of Silent Hill.

3062
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:47,180
There is no hospitals or schools in that area.

3063
02:30:47,180 --> 02:30:48,180
Hmm.

3064
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:49,180
So they're trying something new.

3065
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:52,460
Uh, there will be optional side quests apparently in the game as well.

3066
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:56,020
Uh, combat will be from more like the earlier Silent Hill games.

3067
02:30:56,020 --> 02:31:00,340
You can avoid a lot of encounters and it's advised to avoid encounters.

3068
02:31:00,340 --> 02:31:03,840
You can only carry one melee weapon at a time, such as an axe.

3069
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:06,780
The enemies are very hard to kill, the weapons break easily.

3070
02:31:06,780 --> 02:31:11,300
The only fights you have to do in the game are boss battles.

3071
02:31:11,300 --> 02:31:13,380
Water is going to be an essential part of the game.

3072
02:31:13,380 --> 02:31:17,260
Uh, there's apparently a room in the game that has upside down running water on the

3073
02:31:17,260 --> 02:31:18,260
ceiling.

3074
02:31:18,260 --> 02:31:22,580
Uh, puzzles will be back to scaling difficulty levels so you can have easy puzzles or super

3075
02:31:22,580 --> 02:31:23,740
hard puzzles.

3076
02:31:23,740 --> 02:31:26,540
So that's kind of cool because it sounds like they're going back to their roots a little

3077
02:31:26,540 --> 02:31:27,540
bit.

3078
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:31,580
But it sounds like they're mixing a little bit of old Silent Hill with open world quest

3079
02:31:31,580 --> 02:31:35,600
driven games like, I don't know, Warcraft, Borderlands, that type of thing.

3080
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:38,420
So that's, um, kind of neat, I got to say.

3081
02:31:38,420 --> 02:31:40,920
So, uh, looking forward to trying that.

3082
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:41,920
Hopefully that'll be at E3.

3083
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:46,060
Are you excited for that game at all, Dark Sakura?

3084
02:31:46,060 --> 02:31:51,980
I was looking at the stuff for it, and I think that it's got some interesting stuff to it,

3085
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:52,980
so I might play it.

3086
02:31:52,980 --> 02:31:57,980
But if it's anything at all like, um, whatever the Shattered Memories was, then no.

3087
02:31:57,980 --> 02:32:01,860
Act Definite on our chatroom says Silent Hill Downhill, more like it.

3088
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:03,500
Wham wham wham wham.

3089
02:32:03,500 --> 02:32:08,740
So is that like the last game except they're replacing the snow with lots of rain?

3090
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:12,260
I would have to give it a try.

3091
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:13,260
I would have to give it a chance.

3092
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:16,180
I'd have to give the other ones a chance, I'd have to give this a chance.

3093
02:32:16,180 --> 02:32:19,380
Because I mean, Silent Hill, you know.

3094
02:32:19,380 --> 02:32:24,740
DDR Dollar Bill says Silent Hill Signs Edition.

3095
02:32:24,740 --> 02:32:29,980
I do like the idea of having the open universe.

3096
02:32:29,980 --> 02:32:30,980
So maybe.

3097
02:32:30,980 --> 02:32:31,980
Me too.

3098
02:32:31,980 --> 02:32:34,060
Maybe that will be the redeeming factor.

3099
02:32:34,060 --> 02:32:36,380
Who knows.

3100
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:38,380
What do you most want to see in a new Silent Hill game?

3101
02:32:38,380 --> 02:32:40,660
Do you think they ought to just go back to Silent Hill 2?

3102
02:32:40,660 --> 02:32:43,980
I want to see it produced by Konami in Japan.

3103
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:46,780
That's what I most want to see.

3104
02:32:46,780 --> 02:32:52,580
That's what it needs, is to be back, they need to beg Yamaoka to come back, and they

3105
02:32:52,580 --> 02:32:56,160
need to just get it back done the way they were doing them before.

3106
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:57,540
They were doing them well.

3107
02:32:57,540 --> 02:32:59,420
Why did they screw up?

3108
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:02,060
They shouldn't have ever sent the franchise to the US.

3109
02:33:02,060 --> 02:33:04,060
I mean as far as to be developed in the US.

3110
02:33:04,060 --> 02:33:05,380
That's what I'm saying.

3111
02:33:05,380 --> 02:33:07,660
It doesn't have the same feel anymore.

3112
02:33:07,660 --> 02:33:09,160
Alright.

3113
02:33:09,160 --> 02:33:14,380
We are going to open up the Skype line right now at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

3114
02:33:14,380 --> 02:33:17,920
It does look like the number is working, but the message I think is broken.

3115
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:21,160
So if you call, you're not going to get that little, you've reached Orange Lounge Radio

3116
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:22,160
message line.

3117
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:24,300
I don't, it's some generic thing right now.

3118
02:33:24,300 --> 02:33:26,500
So we'll look at that after the show, why that's going on.

3119
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:30,660
But otherwise, you can give us a call right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or of course our username

3120
02:33:30,660 --> 02:33:32,120
on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

3121
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:35,960
Now there is a bit of delay between live and when the folks can actually start calling,

3122
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:38,500
so I'll ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories.

3123
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:43,660
Yes, there's some new stuff developing on the 3D side of the PlayStation Network.

3124
02:33:43,660 --> 02:33:49,500
Apparently they're going to start offering some 3D movies available on their service.

3125
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:58,780
And one of those 3D movies is, yes, the 3D swimsuit video via, I believe, Sports Illustrated.

3126
02:33:58,780 --> 02:34:03,260
So you will be able to get 3D boobs on the PlayStation 3.

3127
02:34:03,260 --> 02:34:06,140
Not quite porn, but hey, whatever.

3128
02:34:06,140 --> 02:34:08,180
It's Cinemax style porn.

3129
02:34:08,180 --> 02:34:09,540
Yes.

3130
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:11,780
And then, I don't know if you've seen this yet, Rob.

3131
02:34:11,780 --> 02:34:14,340
This is kind of scary.

3132
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:21,020
Another Kinect hack, some guy has actually programmed the Kinect to allow him to play

3133
02:34:21,020 --> 02:34:28,660
around with the figure of Ivy from Soul Calibur with boob physics.

3134
02:34:28,660 --> 02:34:33,500
Well, lack of boob physics, but, you know, Soul Calibur boob physics.

3135
02:34:33,500 --> 02:34:37,300
So he can move around with her boobs bouncing around.

3136
02:34:37,300 --> 02:34:38,300
Gay boob simulations.

3137
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:40,660
All right, we got a call coming in, so let's go to that real quick.

3138
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:41,900
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3139
02:34:41,900 --> 02:34:42,900
Who's this?

3140
02:34:42,900 --> 02:34:43,900
Hi.

3141
02:34:43,900 --> 02:34:44,900
It's DDR Dollar Bill.

3142
02:34:44,900 --> 02:34:45,900
DDR Dollar Bill.

3143
02:34:45,900 --> 02:34:46,900
How are you doing, my friend?

3144
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:47,900
Yeah, I'm doing all right, man.

3145
02:34:47,900 --> 02:34:48,900
Doing all right.

3146
02:34:48,900 --> 02:34:49,900
All right.

3147
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:50,900
What's on your mind?

3148
02:34:50,900 --> 02:34:56,020
Pretty much, I was trying to send an email out to you guys, but I was trying to do it

3149
02:34:56,020 --> 02:34:58,220
with the website, but I kept getting rejected.

3150
02:34:58,220 --> 02:35:00,620
So I figured, let me just call up and explain what's going on.

3151
02:35:00,620 --> 02:35:01,620
Weird.

3152
02:35:01,620 --> 02:35:02,620
I don't know why the website's rejecting.

3153
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:05,100
But, you know, the website had some major issues last week.

3154
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:07,580
I guess some people started spamming our photo feed.

3155
02:35:07,580 --> 02:35:08,580
I missed it.

3156
02:35:08,580 --> 02:35:09,580
I totally missed this.

3157
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:13,220
Like, actdeft and dekeman took care of it when I wasn't listening, or watching, I should

3158
02:35:13,220 --> 02:35:14,220
say.

3159
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:18,180
But I guess, like, people were putting, like, weird, like, porno things in the picture feed.

3160
02:35:18,180 --> 02:35:22,420
And you know, I threatened to pull the plug before if that shit starts happening.

3161
02:35:22,420 --> 02:35:26,140
However, I realize there's no one that actually listens to this show's fault, but we have

3162
02:35:26,140 --> 02:35:27,220
to keep an eye on that now.

3163
02:35:27,220 --> 02:35:30,100
So some of the things with the website might have got tweaked because of that.

3164
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:31,700
Anyhow, what's on your mind?

3165
02:35:31,700 --> 02:35:36,660
Um, pretty much, this is probably going to be the year that I'm going to really just

3166
02:35:36,660 --> 02:35:37,660
stop gaming.

3167
02:35:37,660 --> 02:35:38,660
Video gaming.

3168
02:35:38,660 --> 02:35:39,660
What?

3169
02:35:39,660 --> 02:35:40,660
Why is that?

3170
02:35:40,660 --> 02:35:44,740
Well, the other day, a couple days ago, I was going to, I was just listening to some

3171
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:49,620
old Nintendo games, like some music, you know, the NSF files, the emulators.

3172
02:35:49,620 --> 02:35:53,020
And I was just going back, like, what are some of the best things I remember about games?

3173
02:35:53,020 --> 02:35:58,860
And quite honestly, today's games don't have any excitement to it.

3174
02:35:58,860 --> 02:36:03,780
There's, there's nothing really exciting about playing them anymore.

3175
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:06,300
There's no games that get you excited anymore?

3176
02:36:06,300 --> 02:36:07,620
What type, okay, let me ask you this.

3177
02:36:07,620 --> 02:36:09,780
What type of old Nintendo games did you like?

3178
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:12,660
Ah, some memories, let's see.

3179
02:36:12,660 --> 02:36:17,060
I actually loved the original Ninja Gaiden, for example, the trilogy.

3180
02:36:17,060 --> 02:36:18,060
Okay.

3181
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:22,900
I loved that, um, Blaster Master was another popular one.

3182
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:26,700
I agree, that new Blaster Master game they made a little while ago wasn't nearly as good

3183
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:27,700
as the old one.

3184
02:36:27,700 --> 02:36:28,700
Really unfortunate.

3185
02:36:28,700 --> 02:36:31,260
Ooh, I haven't tried that yet.

3186
02:36:31,260 --> 02:36:34,100
But yeah, like, um, and what was another one I tried?

3187
02:36:34,100 --> 02:36:40,260
I mean, I can go to Genesis games, like, Phantasy Star 2, for example, it was just, those, those

3188
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:43,740
things that have, you know, they gave me great memories, you know, they made me want to play

3189
02:36:43,740 --> 02:36:48,820
it through, no matter how bullshit hard it got, you know, they were just fantastic, like,

3190
02:36:48,820 --> 02:36:49,820
those games.

3191
02:36:49,820 --> 02:36:55,300
And recently, no game really has actually grabbed my attention.

3192
02:36:55,300 --> 02:37:01,260
Maybe just one, but one out of, how many games get released a year, that's a bad number.

3193
02:37:01,260 --> 02:37:04,340
Out of curiosity, what's the one game that grabbed your attention?

3194
02:37:04,340 --> 02:37:05,340
Red Dead Redemption.

3195
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:07,820
Okay, well that was a pretty solid game.

3196
02:37:07,820 --> 02:37:08,820
Interesting.

3197
02:37:08,820 --> 02:37:12,660
And you know what, you seem to really like exploring in games, because a lot of those

3198
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:16,260
games you name, they all have to do something like you explore, and you find new things

3199
02:37:16,260 --> 02:37:20,820
as you go through the world, especially something like Red Dead Redemption is, is a lot about,

3200
02:37:20,820 --> 02:37:21,820
like, exploration.

3201
02:37:21,820 --> 02:37:24,740
So it sounds like these kind of, like, open world games might kind of be your thing, I

3202
02:37:24,740 --> 02:37:26,740
don't know, I'm just kind of guessing.

3203
02:37:26,740 --> 02:37:31,980
But what about, like, new games that kind of call back that retro style, and I mean

3204
02:37:31,980 --> 02:37:35,720
things like Bionic Commando Rearmed, we talked about earlier in the show, has a new release

3205
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:36,720
coming out.

3206
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:39,940
Super Meat Boy, awesome throwback to retro games.

3207
02:37:39,940 --> 02:37:40,940
No interest there?

3208
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:45,140
Oh, okay, from, okay, for Bionic Commando Rearmed, I loved that.

3209
02:37:45,140 --> 02:37:49,940
I, it's like, that event, I eventually beat it, and it was like, it was a satisfying experience.

3210
02:37:49,940 --> 02:37:51,660
I really loved it.

3211
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:56,780
Especially since I loved Bionic Commando since the Arcade Edition, which most people are

3212
02:37:56,780 --> 02:38:00,420
going to be like, there was an arcade?

3213
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:05,620
I seem to recall one, I do, and not even just the Pay Choice 10 one, I think there was actually

3214
02:38:05,620 --> 02:38:08,340
like a, I seem to recall what you're talking about.

3215
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:10,340
Yeah, like that one.

3216
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:15,660
Super Meat Boy is actually very, very interesting case.

3217
02:38:15,660 --> 02:38:22,540
It's, I tried a demo of it, and I liked it, but at the same time, my thoughts were, do

3218
02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:27,580
I really want to go through the harder levels for reward that I'm not going to really enjoy?

3219
02:38:27,580 --> 02:38:32,340
I mean, you know, it's like, am I going to play this difficult game for the sake of it

3220
02:38:32,340 --> 02:38:36,980
being difficult, or am I going to play it because I actually enjoy it?

3221
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:40,620
You know, I see a comment in our chat room, and I think this is a darn good piece of advice

3222
02:38:40,620 --> 02:38:45,600
for you, and Azam in our chat room says, someone get this man a near lethal dose of indie gaming

3223
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:46,820
stat.

3224
02:38:46,820 --> 02:38:49,900
Maybe you're just fed up with what's in the mainstream in a lot of those games that, you

3225
02:38:49,900 --> 02:38:52,620
know, cost $60 to find out a game sucks.

3226
02:38:52,620 --> 02:38:55,940
Have you thought about turning to the indie side of things a little bit, maybe exploring

3227
02:38:55,940 --> 02:38:59,460
a little more what Steam or the Xbox Live indie arcades have on it?

3228
02:38:59,460 --> 02:39:02,100
Ah, that's another good point you guys bring up.

3229
02:39:02,100 --> 02:39:05,460
You are, that's another point I was going to bring up because, yes, I've actually turned

3230
02:39:05,460 --> 02:39:09,860
to indie gaming, and I can tell you one other game that actually really caught my interest,

3231
02:39:09,860 --> 02:39:12,580
and I didn't really mention this, and again, I'm remembering.

3232
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:14,260
Amnesia, have you ever heard of it?

3233
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:15,260
Yes, I have.

3234
02:39:15,260 --> 02:39:17,260
I have heard of Amnesia.

3235
02:39:17,260 --> 02:39:19,140
Scariest fucking game I ever played in my life.

3236
02:39:19,140 --> 02:39:20,340
Yeah, I hear it's great.

3237
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:23,500
I haven't played it myself yet, but I hear it's really scary.

3238
02:39:23,500 --> 02:39:26,620
So yeah, I mean, that's a great indie game.

3239
02:39:26,620 --> 02:39:31,100
I've heard, we've heard a lot, we had somebody on the show last week talking about VVVVV

3240
02:39:31,100 --> 02:39:32,660
being their game of the year.

3241
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:36,820
I mean, Super Meat Boy of sorts is an indie game as well.

3242
02:39:36,820 --> 02:39:39,580
There's a lot of these indie packs that are available on Steam.

3243
02:39:39,580 --> 02:39:43,740
I don't know, you know, it's not as cheap now as they were at Christmas time, but things

3244
02:39:43,740 --> 02:39:47,300
where you can get like, you know, kind of like a sampling of different types of games.

3245
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:48,300
Pretty cheap.

3246
02:39:48,300 --> 02:39:50,420
The Humble Indie Bundle was out recently.

3247
02:39:50,420 --> 02:39:55,020
You know, maybe there's more to look for in there, where you don't feel like you're getting

3248
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:58,060
as shafted with the money you're spending.

3249
02:39:58,060 --> 02:40:01,060
Especially when it's like you can't replay much demos these days.

3250
02:40:01,060 --> 02:40:02,060
Absolutely.

3251
02:40:02,060 --> 02:40:03,060
You know.

3252
02:40:03,060 --> 02:40:07,600
Well, DDR Dollar Bill, I hope you find something to kind of change your mind a little bit.

3253
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:11,660
You know, there's so many types of games out there, but maybe it's just not gonna be a

3254
02:40:11,660 --> 02:40:15,300
AAA game from the developer, but at the same time, you liked Red Dead Redemption.

3255
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:20,840
So I wouldn't look away completely from what the mainstream's doing, because they'll be

3256
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:23,260
more like Red Dead soon, trust me.

3257
02:40:23,260 --> 02:40:27,860
Yeah, I guess it's just the start of the year, so I'll give it a chance.

3258
02:40:27,860 --> 02:40:28,860
That's true.

3259
02:40:28,860 --> 02:40:29,860
I think it'll be okay.

3260
02:40:29,860 --> 02:40:31,940
Alright, DDR Dollar Bill, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, but thanks for

3261
02:40:31,940 --> 02:40:32,940
giving us a call.

3262
02:40:32,940 --> 02:40:33,940
Good topic.

3263
02:40:33,940 --> 02:40:34,940
No problem.

3264
02:40:34,940 --> 02:40:35,940
Alright, take care, guys.

3265
02:40:35,940 --> 02:40:36,940
Later, guys.

3266
02:40:36,940 --> 02:40:37,940
Later.

3267
02:40:37,940 --> 02:40:38,940
Alright, good call.

3268
02:40:38,940 --> 02:40:39,940
Let's go to another one.

3269
02:40:39,940 --> 02:40:40,940
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.

3270
02:40:40,940 --> 02:40:41,940
What's up, guys?

3271
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:42,940
This is Taijudo.

3272
02:40:42,940 --> 02:40:43,940
Taijudo.

3273
02:40:43,940 --> 02:40:44,940
What's on your mind, buddy?

3274
02:40:44,940 --> 02:40:45,940
No, no.

3275
02:40:45,940 --> 02:40:51,660
Just before I go into it, I wanna talk about, I just wanted to recommend a game.

3276
02:40:51,660 --> 02:40:55,260
Well, not actually a game, but what you guys were doing earlier, where you're combining

3277
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:56,260
toys and games.

3278
02:40:56,260 --> 02:40:57,260
Yeah, yeah.

3279
02:40:57,260 --> 02:40:58,260
What's that?

3280
02:40:58,260 --> 02:41:03,260
How about a chase in the real warriors with the burnout engine?

3281
02:41:03,260 --> 02:41:06,060
Dude, sweet!

3282
02:41:06,060 --> 02:41:07,060
I like that.

3283
02:41:07,060 --> 02:41:12,380
And I'm kinda surprised we didn't get something in that whole racing game theme, because there

3284
02:41:12,380 --> 02:41:14,020
was so much good racing stuff.

3285
02:41:14,020 --> 02:41:18,260
You know, I did consider for a moment a Power Wheels racing game.

3286
02:41:18,260 --> 02:41:19,260
I did.

3287
02:41:19,260 --> 02:41:22,460
That thought did cross my mind, but I like your idea a lot, so.

3288
02:41:22,460 --> 02:41:23,700
Yeah, don't forget about Mask.

3289
02:41:23,700 --> 02:41:24,700
That was also great.

3290
02:41:24,700 --> 02:41:27,980
I don't know about the cartoon, but the toys were great.

3291
02:41:27,980 --> 02:41:32,620
But onto what I was gonna talk about, I don't know if there's still any people out there

3292
02:41:32,620 --> 02:41:37,460
that were interested in the agency MMO that was supposed to come out like eons ago.

3293
02:41:37,460 --> 02:41:38,460
Yeah, whatever happened to that?

3294
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:39,460
You guys remember this game?

3295
02:41:39,460 --> 02:41:40,460
You've been following this?

3296
02:41:40,460 --> 02:41:43,020
It's supposed to still, supposedly it's still in development.

3297
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:44,020
I mean, I doubt that.

3298
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:48,620
I mean, it's been a long time since you've heard anything from it, but according to a

3299
02:41:48,620 --> 02:41:53,260
lot of sources, they're all saying that the game's still coming out on PlayStation 3 and

3300
02:41:53,260 --> 02:41:56,180
the PC, supposedly the PC before the PS3.

3301
02:41:56,180 --> 02:42:01,200
But I don't know, that's kinda shaky, but I do have some good news for people who may

3302
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:02,780
be still interested in that game.

3303
02:42:02,780 --> 02:42:03,780
What's up?

3304
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:08,740
There's a Facebook app made by the developers of that game that you can actually play now.

3305
02:42:08,740 --> 02:42:12,860
It's kinda like Mafia Wars, you know, the whole text-based type deal.

3306
02:42:12,860 --> 02:42:13,860
But it's a lot of fun.

3307
02:42:13,860 --> 02:42:17,460
The presentation is really great, and I'm enjoying it.

3308
02:42:17,460 --> 02:42:18,780
Awesome.

3309
02:42:18,780 --> 02:42:24,060
So have they nailed a release window for this yet, or does it need to go through the extensive

3310
02:42:24,060 --> 02:42:26,520
testing first?

3311
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:27,520
That I don't know.

3312
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:29,460
I mean, you guys can look that up.

3313
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:32,700
As far as I know, they're reworking the game.

3314
02:42:32,700 --> 02:42:38,240
They weren't satisfied with what they originally had, the stuff that they were showing at E3,

3315
02:42:38,240 --> 02:42:42,660
and they're supposedly, like, rebuilding a whole other type of game, because for whatever

3316
02:42:42,660 --> 02:42:45,540
their reasons are, they weren't happy with it.

3317
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:49,460
You know what, that's okay to go back and retool it, because I don't want them to release

3318
02:42:49,460 --> 02:42:50,460
a bunch of crap.

3319
02:42:50,460 --> 02:42:53,100
Because look at what happened with Final Fantasy XIV.

3320
02:42:53,100 --> 02:42:57,740
They didn't really test that thoroughly enough, and when they released it, it ended up being

3321
02:42:57,740 --> 02:43:03,740
kind of hit with a thud, and now they're going to have to rework the game while it's out,

3322
02:43:03,740 --> 02:43:07,460
and now it's kind of done, you know what I mean?

3323
02:43:07,460 --> 02:43:11,500
So I just hope they didn't take out the feature where there was supposed to be some feature

3324
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:16,580
where you could actually play the game through your cell phone, like you're supposed to take

3325
02:43:16,580 --> 02:43:22,340
on these little, I guess you would call them micro-agents, and they were supposed to build

3326
02:43:22,340 --> 02:43:25,620
cards and gadgets for you, and you were supposed to be able to manage that through your cell

3327
02:43:25,620 --> 02:43:26,620
phone somehow.

3328
02:43:26,620 --> 02:43:27,860
And I thought that was a great idea.

3329
02:43:27,860 --> 02:43:32,020
I like the fact that they were taking MMO in another direction, so hopefully they're

3330
02:43:32,020 --> 02:43:36,540
not coming out with just something like APB where you're just running and gunning, and

3331
02:43:36,540 --> 02:43:38,500
it'll hold a lot of BS.

3332
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:42,620
I really like that idea of kind of like interacting with the cell phones more and other types

3333
02:43:42,620 --> 02:43:44,140
of things like that.

3334
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:47,020
I think that's a really kind of good use of...

3335
02:43:47,020 --> 02:43:48,020
Whoa!

3336
02:43:48,020 --> 02:43:49,020
Ah!

3337
02:43:49,020 --> 02:43:50,020
Sorry about that.

3338
02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:51,180
Somebody sent me a YouTube link.

3339
02:43:51,180 --> 02:43:56,740
I brought it up a little soon.

3340
02:43:56,740 --> 02:43:59,620
Sorry.

3341
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:00,620
That totally threw me.

3342
02:44:00,620 --> 02:44:01,620
Way to go!

3343
02:44:01,620 --> 02:44:02,620
You're dead here.

3344
02:44:02,620 --> 02:44:03,620
I know, gosh.

3345
02:44:03,620 --> 02:44:04,620
All right, sorry about that.

3346
02:44:04,620 --> 02:44:07,020
But that's kind of the way games like Warcraft and so forth are going, where they're fully

3347
02:44:07,020 --> 02:44:11,660
interactive with all these different types of platforms, like the mobile phones and everything.

3348
02:44:11,660 --> 02:44:14,580
Yeah, I think that's the way to go.

3349
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:17,780
Like I said, I don't know if you remember what I called last week, and I'm all about

3350
02:44:17,780 --> 02:44:23,540
game innovation, and I kind of agree with your previous caller that games need to be

3351
02:44:23,540 --> 02:44:24,540
a little more innovative.

3352
02:44:24,540 --> 02:44:28,420
I mean, I'm not going to quit gaming anytime soon, but they do need to come out with something

3353
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:32,340
more than just Call of Duty and all the other bullshit that they're coming out with.

3354
02:44:32,340 --> 02:44:33,340
I want something...

3355
02:44:33,340 --> 02:44:36,280
I want them to really take advantage of what we have now.

3356
02:44:36,280 --> 02:44:37,860
We have like motion control crap.

3357
02:44:37,860 --> 02:44:38,860
We have HD crap.

3358
02:44:38,860 --> 02:44:41,500
I mean, there's just so much that they can do with it.

3359
02:44:41,500 --> 02:44:46,620
I mean, I know that it's a whole money management thing, and there's a memory thing, and there's

3360
02:44:46,620 --> 02:44:49,740
a lot of balancing things that you have to do with the games, but I know that they can

3361
02:44:49,740 --> 02:44:52,140
do a lot better than what they're doing now.

3362
02:44:52,140 --> 02:44:53,140
They can at least try.

3363
02:44:53,140 --> 02:44:54,140
It's just BS that's coming up.

3364
02:44:54,140 --> 02:44:55,140
Alright.

3365
02:44:55,140 --> 02:44:58,060
Well, we'll be keeping an eye on this game.

3366
02:44:58,060 --> 02:45:01,780
It does appear that they're still targeting the second half of 2011 for this, but it'll

3367
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:03,940
be done when it's done, darn it.

3368
02:45:03,940 --> 02:45:10,020
Yeah, and oh, that name of the app is the Agency Covert Ops.

3369
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:11,020
Look for that on Facebook.

3370
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:12,020
That's the name of it.

3371
02:45:12,020 --> 02:45:14,620
That is available on Facebook?

3372
02:45:14,620 --> 02:45:18,380
And it looks like it's been up since May of last year, missions, minigames, and sharing

3373
02:45:18,380 --> 02:45:20,980
achievements with Facebook friends.

3374
02:45:20,980 --> 02:45:21,980
Look at that.

3375
02:45:21,980 --> 02:45:22,980
Alright, thanks buddy.

3376
02:45:22,980 --> 02:45:23,980
Thank you so much for the call.

3377
02:45:23,980 --> 02:45:24,980
Alright, goodnight everyone.

3378
02:45:24,980 --> 02:45:25,980
Later.

3379
02:45:25,980 --> 02:45:31,420
Alright, let's go ahead and take one more call here on the Skype line tonight, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

3380
02:45:31,420 --> 02:45:33,900
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3381
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:37,900
Again, that's 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

3382
02:45:37,900 --> 02:45:41,860
Loki, do you have any more last minute stories for us while we wait for that call?

3383
02:45:41,860 --> 02:45:42,900
Yeah.

3384
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:45,220
There's actually some other cool stuff.

3385
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:47,660
Some stuff coming out of CES.

3386
02:45:47,660 --> 02:45:51,860
They're talking a little bit about Avatar Connect, which is gonna be kind of a new chat

3387
02:45:51,860 --> 02:45:57,420
method that you can use to actually, you know, chat with people, you know, recognize facial

3388
02:45:57,420 --> 02:45:59,300
expressions and stuff like that.

3389
02:45:59,300 --> 02:46:04,000
So kind of mapping your voice to your avatar, which is kind of neat, and that'll be available

3390
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,500
for gold numbers later this spring.

3391
02:46:06,500 --> 02:46:09,780
You'll use it once and then the thrill will be over, but I do like the idea like you can

3392
02:46:09,780 --> 02:46:11,420
like publish it to Facebook and stuff.

3393
02:46:11,420 --> 02:46:14,340
I'll bet you we're gonna start seeing podcasts recorded like this.

3394
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:17,340
We should do an episode of OLR like this, like a bonus episode of OLR.

3395
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:18,340
That would be funny.

3396
02:46:18,340 --> 02:46:20,200
That would be kind of funny.

3397
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:23,580
That's like the one thing we have to do and then that'll be it.

3398
02:46:23,580 --> 02:46:26,580
And the other thing, I don't know if this pissed you off, Rob, they're talking about

3399
02:46:26,580 --> 02:46:32,060
bringing Game Room to the Windows Phone 7.

3400
02:46:32,060 --> 02:46:35,540
That wouldn't piss me off unless they're gonna charge us all over again for everything.

3401
02:46:35,540 --> 02:46:36,540
Probably.

3402
02:46:36,540 --> 02:46:38,240
Now I'm pissed!

3403
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:44,460
And then also they're gonna be adding on to Windows Phone 7 Fable Queen Golf.

3404
02:46:44,460 --> 02:46:47,540
And I believe they're also bringing in that poker game as well.

3405
02:46:47,540 --> 02:46:48,540
So.

3406
02:46:48,540 --> 02:46:49,540
Alright.

3407
02:46:49,540 --> 02:46:50,540
Interesting.

3408
02:46:50,540 --> 02:46:54,140
Anything else for last minute stories tonight?

3409
02:46:54,140 --> 02:46:58,480
Turbografx Games coming to the PlayStation Network.

3410
02:46:58,480 --> 02:47:02,100
So you can play games that, like Keith Courage, that weren't very good.

3411
02:47:02,100 --> 02:47:04,060
Yeah, these are from Hudson.

3412
02:47:04,060 --> 02:47:05,180
Don't get me started.

3413
02:47:05,180 --> 02:47:08,220
Alien Crush, Bomberman 94, Box Adventure.

3414
02:47:08,220 --> 02:47:09,220
Some of them were good.

3415
02:47:09,220 --> 02:47:10,220
Yeah.

3416
02:47:10,220 --> 02:47:11,220
Some of them were good.

3417
02:47:11,220 --> 02:47:16,580
Dungeon Explorer, New Adventure Islands, Soldier Blades, Super Star Soldier, Victory Run, World

3418
02:47:16,580 --> 02:47:18,820
Sports Competition, and Nootopia.

3419
02:47:18,820 --> 02:47:21,140
Alright, I gotta call waiting, so let's-

3420
02:47:21,140 --> 02:47:23,540
Nootopia is a great game and it's a lot like Zelda.

3421
02:47:23,540 --> 02:47:24,540
Let me go to the phones.

3422
02:47:24,540 --> 02:47:26,060
I think you've done, haven't you done it as a classic game of the week?

3423
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:27,320
I think I have done Nootopia.

3424
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:28,860
Let me go to the phones, cause I got somebody waiting.

3425
02:47:28,860 --> 02:47:30,340
Hi, you're on OrangeLawn's Radio, who's this?

3426
02:47:30,340 --> 02:47:31,340
Hey, this is X-Link.

3427
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:33,340
Hey, X-Link, what's on your mind, buddy?

3428
02:47:33,340 --> 02:47:34,340
Hey, nothing much.

3429
02:47:34,340 --> 02:47:39,140
You know, sometimes games and stuff, sometimes, I can understand the other color a while back.

3430
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:42,700
I mean, there's been times when I step back from playing video games for a while, because

3431
02:47:42,700 --> 02:47:43,700
you know, you get burned out.

3432
02:47:43,700 --> 02:47:47,340
You play stuff, you know, you think a lot of stuff comes out, it's the same thing, it's,

3433
02:47:47,340 --> 02:47:52,940
you know, you know, I take a few days off, maybe read some books, you know, they come

3434
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:54,300
back and do something else.

3435
02:47:54,300 --> 02:48:00,020
But you know, I'm sure there's something out there for a little bit for everyone, and yeah,

3436
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:04,220
and as I was telling you earlier, they should make Millie Born into another PC game if they,

3437
02:48:04,220 --> 02:48:08,100
I mean, I know there was one a long time ago, but I think they should make that into another

3438
02:48:08,100 --> 02:48:09,100
one.

3439
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:10,100
They do need to make another one.

3440
02:48:10,100 --> 02:48:16,740
I have a indie app on my iTouch that I bought from the store that was 99 cents, that was

3441
02:48:16,740 --> 02:48:21,900
kind of the card game, but though it's not the official version, but it plays the same

3442
02:48:21,900 --> 02:48:24,580
way, which is really cool.

3443
02:48:24,580 --> 02:48:30,780
You know, I like playing all kinds of different stuff, role playing, card games, you know,

3444
02:48:30,780 --> 02:48:36,820
games like Super Meat Boy, Nick's Quest was another good one I had played for a bit, you

3445
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:39,100
know, first-person shooters.

3446
02:48:39,100 --> 02:48:42,900
So when I get bored of one thing, I kind of switch it around to another thing, so that

3447
02:48:42,900 --> 02:48:47,500
way I don't get too burnt out on playing one genre of a certain game.

3448
02:48:47,500 --> 02:48:51,660
That's not bad advice at all, and especially, you know, with thanks to the magic of emulators,

3449
02:48:51,660 --> 02:48:55,860
or I'm sorry, Virtual Console, you know, you can have a variety of different games, you

3450
02:48:55,860 --> 02:48:59,100
know, especially the old school stuff, you know, because that's what our listeners seem

3451
02:48:59,100 --> 02:49:00,880
to enjoy, that you can go back and forth to.

3452
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:04,580
You know, one odd suggestion maybe I would have for that listener, and maybe this is

3453
02:49:04,580 --> 02:49:08,280
one of those things where I'll get laughed out of the room, but maybe that person should

3454
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:10,040
try an MMO?

3455
02:49:10,040 --> 02:49:14,180
Maybe if games were a little more social, I don't know, like, for me, like WoW being

3456
02:49:14,180 --> 02:49:19,220
the big social thing it is, kind of keeps me, is what keeps me coming back to that game,

3457
02:49:19,220 --> 02:49:20,220
but at the same time...

3458
02:49:20,220 --> 02:49:26,620
And there's a lot of free ones, too, there's, I mean, I used to play, before I played WoW,

3459
02:49:26,620 --> 02:49:32,140
I played a Persona one that they had that was totally free, so I mean, you know, you

3460
02:49:32,140 --> 02:49:37,340
don't have to really pay to play, so to speak, you know, there's a lot of free stuff out

3461
02:49:37,340 --> 02:49:41,340
there, it's just, you know, it might be another niche, or, you know, something else totally

3462
02:49:41,340 --> 02:49:42,340
different out there.

3463
02:49:42,340 --> 02:49:45,180
You know, I don't think there's anything wrong, though, with the advice of, you know, if you

3464
02:49:45,180 --> 02:49:47,980
think you're bored of video games, take a break, there's nothing wrong with it, you

3465
02:49:47,980 --> 02:49:51,480
don't have to game every single day, I'm not gonna think any less of you, none of us will,

3466
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:52,480
you know?

3467
02:49:52,480 --> 02:49:53,480
That's not true, but that's alright.

3468
02:49:53,480 --> 02:49:54,480
Stop.

3469
02:49:54,480 --> 02:50:01,180
Go watch some movies, or catch up on TV shows, go read a book, go start another project,

3470
02:50:01,180 --> 02:50:03,900
and then maybe you'll find that game that wants to bring you back.

3471
02:50:03,900 --> 02:50:07,660
And, you know, it's kind of interesting, too, when you're talking about this whole, you

3472
02:50:07,660 --> 02:50:11,580
know, we're, you know, about being lazy and stuff, it's because mostly we get technology,

3473
02:50:11,580 --> 02:50:18,020
our technology has grown so rapidly, so quickly, and it's so easy to access a lot of different

3474
02:50:18,020 --> 02:50:21,660
stuff so quickly, like, why do I need to go to the library to check out a book?

3475
02:50:21,660 --> 02:50:25,220
I can go online and buy the book straight from Amazon and get it right here in my own

3476
02:50:25,220 --> 02:50:31,220
living room, or why do you have to, you know, it's just, unfortunately, with technology

3477
02:50:31,220 --> 02:50:36,540
that, you know, there's always pros and cons to everything, and unfortunately, a pro thing

3478
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:40,780
is it's quicker and easier, but a con is, too, is that we don't do as much as we used

3479
02:50:40,780 --> 02:50:45,820
to, and it's like, we get to a point in society now, it's like, we want things almost virtually

3480
02:50:45,820 --> 02:50:50,100
handed to us, because we're like, well, we can get this this way, why can't we do this?

3481
02:50:50,100 --> 02:50:54,060
I've got to admit, I've bought a book on my iPhone before, and one of the reasons I kind

3482
02:50:54,060 --> 02:50:59,380
of like that sort of technology is that I have the book with me everywhere I go in case

3483
02:50:59,380 --> 02:51:03,980
I'm ever bored, and that way I'm not carrying around a bulky book, you know?

3484
02:51:03,980 --> 02:51:08,080
That's kind of the one, like, really advantage I like of having it on there.

3485
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:13,100
But I do also understand, you know, there's really no substitute for an old, dusty book.

3486
02:51:13,100 --> 02:51:14,100
Yeah.

3487
02:51:14,100 --> 02:51:16,300
So, I mean, but, you know, I still read books.

3488
02:51:16,300 --> 02:51:20,180
I have plenty of books on my shelf that I read that's actual, physical books.

3489
02:51:20,180 --> 02:51:23,780
I mean, you know, not everything is an e-book, it's clearly my strategy guides, I mean, I

3490
02:51:23,780 --> 02:51:27,780
have a lot of limited edition strategy guides that I like to have, just for, you know, collector's

3491
02:51:27,780 --> 02:51:31,140
editions, just for, you know, to have on my shelf, because I like looking at them.

3492
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:36,780
So I mean, you know, so I mean, there's, it's kind of funny when you're saying that, because

3493
02:51:36,780 --> 02:51:41,060
it brought me back to the whole thing back when I was taking technology in class in high

3494
02:51:41,060 --> 02:51:44,140
school, and we're talking about, you know, because of all these pros, there's going to

3495
02:51:44,140 --> 02:51:50,860
be con, you know, like fast food, and movies, and now we got books, and video games, and,

3496
02:51:50,860 --> 02:51:55,340
you know, we don't have to do as much as we used to, to get what we want.

3497
02:51:55,340 --> 02:52:01,540
It's okay, I press a few buttons, or click on a few things, and boom, there it is, so.

3498
02:52:01,540 --> 02:52:02,540
Boom there it is.

3499
02:52:02,540 --> 02:52:04,860
That's, that's definitely the culture we live in now.

3500
02:52:04,860 --> 02:52:09,300
All right, X-Link, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for

3501
02:52:09,300 --> 02:52:10,300
the call, as always.

3502
02:52:10,300 --> 02:52:11,300
As always.

3503
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:12,300
All right.

3504
02:52:12,300 --> 02:52:14,300
How proud are you of Jamie, and her level 63?

3505
02:52:14,300 --> 02:52:15,300
I'm very proud of her.

3506
02:52:15,300 --> 02:52:20,740
30 levels in one week, Jesus, I can't do anything more, you might get explicit for it.

3507
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:26,220
Yeah, but, yeah, damn, that's all I'm gonna say, damn, I couldn't believe that, 30 levels

3508
02:52:26,220 --> 02:52:32,020
in almost a week, I, that was just amazing, that, that really, congratulations.

3509
02:52:32,020 --> 02:52:34,620
Thank you, and, and thank you as well for the gift.

3510
02:52:34,620 --> 02:52:36,020
Okay, any time.

3511
02:52:36,020 --> 02:52:38,060
You know, I don't, I don't want to start stuff.

3512
02:52:38,060 --> 02:52:41,140
Please do not read into what I'm about to say the wrong way, because I have nothing

3513
02:52:41,140 --> 02:52:44,680
but respect for other independent podcasters and other indie shows, but there's another

3514
02:52:44,680 --> 02:52:48,020
Warcraft show on this network, and I enjoy the show, it's a great show, I listen to it

3515
02:52:48,020 --> 02:52:52,580
almost every week, but the guy on that show, I think he's been level 51 for, like, four

3516
02:52:52,580 --> 02:52:58,660
years or something like that, and, you know, I, play a game how you want to play a game,

3517
02:52:58,660 --> 02:53:04,600
that's fine, but just, for you to blow through 30 levels in a week just kind of made me laugh

3518
02:53:04,600 --> 02:53:08,900
a little bit, because I'm just kind of like, man, I know other people that are just, like,

3519
02:53:08,900 --> 02:53:12,420
they've been, they, they don't even do a level a month.

3520
02:53:12,420 --> 02:53:16,500
I'm still gonna see if it's possible for me to make 85 before classes start next week.

3521
02:53:16,500 --> 02:53:20,820
Well, what, it took me to get, it almost took me a year to get to 80, but that's only because

3522
02:53:20,820 --> 02:53:25,340
I was only playing a few times a week, and, and I was just doing it a few, few hours a

3523
02:53:25,340 --> 02:53:30,980
day, and, but then again, how was I get to 82, Rob, again, when I got Cata?

3524
02:53:30,980 --> 02:53:31,980
Archaeology whoring.

3525
02:53:31,980 --> 02:53:36,260
That's right, there we go, non-stop, so, yeah, that was a lot of fun.

3526
02:53:36,260 --> 02:53:40,680
You guys are gonna have to show me the ropes, but, the one thing, though, is that, and this

3527
02:53:40,680 --> 02:53:44,980
is, I think, what chased me off before, is the whole feeling like I'm being forced to

3528
02:53:44,980 --> 02:53:46,980
play with people, you know?

3529
02:53:46,980 --> 02:53:50,540
Just do whatever you want to do, like I said before, you had to open the invitation to

3530
02:53:50,540 --> 02:53:54,540
our raids on Wednesday, and if you want to, that's fine, if you don't, you know, there's

3531
02:53:54,540 --> 02:53:55,540
no right or wrong.

3532
02:53:55,540 --> 02:53:59,700
Well, no, I understand that, I've just, I've, I've been getting the, oh, the, the whole

3533
02:53:59,700 --> 02:54:03,980
game experience is when you're playing with, doing, you know, the dungeon thing with a

3534
02:54:03,980 --> 02:54:08,420
lot of people, and I'm like, I've been enjoying playing by myself, I like playing with one

3535
02:54:08,420 --> 02:54:09,420
or two people.

3536
02:54:09,420 --> 02:54:12,180
Really quickly, and I'm not, I'm not gonna say too much on this, because I know people

3537
02:54:12,180 --> 02:54:16,300
are gonna get shut off, but just like, oh, shit, they're talking about WoW, um, Rob invited

3538
02:54:16,300 --> 02:54:20,860
me to WoW a year ago, and when I started playing, I thought for sure that it's gonna be kind

3539
02:54:20,860 --> 02:54:23,860
of like, oh, I'm like, okay, Rob's gonna show me ropes, and I'm gonna do all this stuff,

3540
02:54:23,860 --> 02:54:26,740
and this is gonna be great, and blah, blah, blah, and I know Rob had his own thing, he

3541
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:31,380
was really busy with work and whatnot, I, I mean, Rob testified, there was times when

3542
02:54:31,380 --> 02:54:35,940
I had to play with him, but for the most part, between me getting to one and 80, was, other

3543
02:54:35,940 --> 02:54:41,100
than the help from another guild leader of ours, um, who will remain nameless, that I

3544
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:47,660
did 90% of that stuff on my own, I, I, I went through, I, I, I went through all the pug,

3545
02:54:47,660 --> 02:54:53,420
the pugging stuff, through the, the dungeons, and everything else, but for the most part,

3546
02:54:53,420 --> 02:55:01,500
I did non-stop questing from day one, from day one when I started to, when I got to,

3547
02:55:01,500 --> 02:55:07,040
like, 80, um, among a few odds and ends and PVP and whatnot, but, um, but yeah, I had

3548
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:10,540
a lot of fun playing by myself, and that's one of the few games I can actually say, you

3549
02:55:10,540 --> 02:55:15,940
can play by yourself and have a lot of fun doing it, and you don't really need that,

3550
02:55:15,940 --> 02:55:20,100
that whole, that whole, oh, I need to play with six of my friends in order to get this

3551
02:55:20,100 --> 02:55:21,100
done.

3552
02:55:21,100 --> 02:55:23,580
And you need to play with your friends, too, that's what keeps me in WoW, is raiding.

3553
02:55:23,580 --> 02:55:24,580
Definitely, definitely, by far.

3554
02:55:24,580 --> 02:55:28,580
So, alright, well, anyhow, I gotta let you go before we have Horde House to spin off

3555
02:55:28,580 --> 02:55:31,660
here, but thank you so much for, uh, your call, okay, buddy?

3556
02:55:31,660 --> 02:55:33,460
Any time, any time for me.

3557
02:55:33,460 --> 02:55:34,460
Later.

3558
02:55:34,460 --> 02:55:37,420
I think, uh, pretty soon, I think, especially, like, when you hit, like, about maybe, like,

3559
02:55:37,420 --> 02:55:40,540
level 70 or so, we're gonna have to, well, maybe soon, we'll have to run you into some

3560
02:55:40,540 --> 02:55:43,460
dungeons and, uh, show you the ropes in dungeons.

3561
02:55:43,460 --> 02:55:47,380
I just wanna basically learn how to play with other people so that if I decide that I wanna

3562
02:55:47,380 --> 02:55:49,700
be social, that I'm not gonna kill everybody.

3563
02:55:49,700 --> 02:55:50,700
Yeah.

3564
02:55:50,700 --> 02:55:54,420
I have a problem of accidentally casting my area of effect.

3565
02:55:54,420 --> 02:55:59,860
The dark side of pug groups is that they're not always noob-friendly, and, you know, they

3566
02:55:59,860 --> 02:56:04,460
expect that you know everything, and you may not, and that's very unfortunate, but anyway,

3567
02:56:04,460 --> 02:56:05,460
let's move on.

3568
02:56:05,460 --> 02:56:06,740
I don't wanna get too far into WoW talk.

3569
02:56:06,740 --> 02:56:09,220
Uh, alright, that's gonna do it, though, for the Skypline tonight.

3570
02:56:09,220 --> 02:56:12,100
Thank you guys so much for, uh, your calls, really appreciate it.

3571
02:56:12,100 --> 02:56:16,180
Uh, if you didn't get through, send us an email, mailbag at orangeliontrader.com or

3572
02:56:16,180 --> 02:56:20,300
a tweet at twitter.com slash o-l-r, there's plenty of ways to interact with our program.

3573
02:56:20,300 --> 02:56:22,020
There's also the live chat room every week.

3574
02:56:22,020 --> 02:56:26,140
Alright, uh, that, however, is going to bring us to the end of another episode of Orange

3575
02:56:26,140 --> 02:56:27,140
Lounge Radio.

3576
02:56:27,140 --> 02:56:28,740
We're all done here.

3577
02:56:28,740 --> 02:56:31,420
Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3578
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:34,460
Uh, actually, first I should ask Loki if there's any other last minute stories.

3579
02:56:34,460 --> 02:56:35,460
I don't think-

3580
02:56:35,460 --> 02:56:36,460
I'm done.

3581
02:56:36,460 --> 02:56:37,460
Oh, you're done?

3582
02:56:37,460 --> 02:56:39,020
Alright, well then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

3583
02:56:39,020 --> 02:56:41,620
Uh, DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?

3584
02:56:41,620 --> 02:56:44,240
85 by Wednesday.

3585
02:56:44,240 --> 02:56:45,240
Good luck.

3586
02:56:45,240 --> 02:56:46,820
Not 85, I meant 65.

3587
02:56:46,820 --> 02:56:48,820
Oh yeah, you can do it.

3588
02:56:48,820 --> 02:56:49,820
65 by tomorrow?

3589
02:56:49,820 --> 02:56:50,820
Yeah.

3590
02:56:50,820 --> 02:56:51,820
I don't know your schedule.

3591
02:56:51,820 --> 02:56:52,820
Maybe.

3592
02:56:52,820 --> 02:56:53,820
Just made 63.

3593
02:56:53,820 --> 02:56:54,820
Alright.

3594
02:56:54,820 --> 02:56:55,820
Loki, what's your final thought?

3595
02:56:55,820 --> 02:56:59,860
Um, I don't know, Tron.

3596
02:56:59,860 --> 02:57:04,180
My final thought is, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Sherie, Sherie, Sherie, Sherie, Sherie,

3597
02:57:04,180 --> 02:57:05,180
Shermie, Sherie, Sherie.

3598
02:57:05,180 --> 02:57:06,180
Yeah, she just came waddling out.

3599
02:57:06,180 --> 02:57:08,500
That's right, now she's just sitting there waiting to poop.

3600
02:57:08,500 --> 02:57:09,500
Hey, babycakes.

3601
02:57:09,500 --> 02:57:10,500
Alright.

3602
02:57:10,500 --> 02:57:12,500
Can I say something to everybody?

3603
02:57:12,500 --> 02:57:13,980
Let's talk about the tester.

3604
02:57:13,980 --> 02:57:19,580
I don't think Shermie is very talkative.

3605
02:57:19,580 --> 02:57:21,900
Shermie's like, what the hell is that?

3606
02:57:21,900 --> 02:57:23,020
Get that out of my face.

3607
02:57:23,020 --> 02:57:24,020
No comment.

3608
02:57:24,020 --> 02:57:25,020
Alright.

3609
02:57:25,020 --> 02:57:27,900
Uh, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us.

3610
02:57:27,900 --> 02:57:29,260
We really appreciate your support.

3611
02:57:29,260 --> 02:57:32,260
Remember, if you like what you heard, we don't make any money off of this show.

3612
02:57:32,260 --> 02:57:35,300
All we ask is that you tell, uh, one or two people about the show.

3613
02:57:35,300 --> 02:57:40,620
Help us spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio, especially as we approach our 400th episode

3614
02:57:40,620 --> 02:57:41,620
next month.

3615
02:57:41,620 --> 02:57:42,700
I can't believe it.

3616
02:57:42,700 --> 02:57:43,700
Thank you guys again.

3617
02:57:43,700 --> 02:57:44,700
Have a wonderful week.

3618
02:57:44,700 --> 02:57:45,700
We'll see you next week.

3619
02:57:45,700 --> 02:57:50,420
I'm going to be back here to do it all again with a three day weekend, by the way, for

3620
02:57:50,420 --> 02:57:51,420
me next week.

3621
02:57:51,420 --> 02:57:57,020
So, you never know what antics might, if I could get a ride home somehow, uh, we, you

3622
02:57:57,020 --> 02:57:58,020
never know.

3623
02:57:58,020 --> 02:57:59,020
You can sleep on the couch.

3624
02:57:59,020 --> 02:58:00,020
You never know what antics might happen.

3625
02:58:00,020 --> 02:58:01,020
You can sleep in the vault.

3626
02:58:01,020 --> 02:58:02,660
Do you want to do a drunk show next week that bad?

3627
02:58:02,660 --> 02:58:03,660
Will you drink?

3628
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:04,660
I know he won't.

3629
02:58:04,660 --> 02:58:05,660
He can't.

3630
02:58:05,660 --> 02:58:06,660
He's got to be responsible daddy, but will you?

3631
02:58:06,660 --> 02:58:07,660
Maybe, maybe I will.

3632
02:58:07,660 --> 02:58:08,660
Okay.

3633
02:58:08,660 --> 02:58:13,780
I, because it's been that long, I will get nice and toasty on air for listeners if I

3634
02:58:13,780 --> 02:58:15,740
can figure out a ride home or something.

3635
02:58:15,740 --> 02:58:16,740
Okay.

3636
02:58:16,740 --> 02:58:18,740
So maybe I'll, I'll see if somebody can drive me to the show.

3637
02:58:18,740 --> 02:58:19,740
We'll see.

3638
02:58:19,740 --> 02:58:20,740
Okay.

3639
02:58:20,740 --> 02:58:21,740
All right.

3640
02:58:21,740 --> 02:58:22,740
So lots to look forward to next week.

3641
02:58:22,740 --> 02:58:23,740
We have to warn Dan.

3642
02:58:23,740 --> 02:58:24,740
Yeah.

3643
02:58:24,740 --> 02:58:25,740
Warn Dan.
