0	20320	Today, January 9th, 2011, a popular PC game prepares for release on Xbox Live.
20320	24720	More details come out about the next Elder Scrolls game, and EA prepares to disconnect
24720	31400	the servers for several old games.
31400	35080	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange
35080	38560	Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
38560	44240	We do tape live at All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
44240	48080	ish right after the Bobby Black Wolf show wraps up.
48080	52400	We really like Bobby because he always has us on our show and does this nice little transition.
52400	57640	Tonight, we were talking about light-up cereal boxes, but before we get to yummy delicious
57640	61800	electrical cereal, let me introduce the cast and crew here at Orange Lounge Radio.
61800	66040	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always is the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie
66040	67040	Summers.
67040	68040	Hi.
68040	69040	How are you?
69040	70040	I'm hungry.
70040	72560	What would you prefer, electric Trix or electric Honey Nut Cheerios?
72560	73560	Neither.
73560	74560	Why?
74560	75560	Because I hate both of them.
75560	79160	Well, what electric cereal would you like?
79160	80160	Frosted mini-wheats.
80160	82480	Grape nuts.
82480	88040	I do adore grape nuts, but I'd have to say my favorite cereal of all time is frosted
88040	89440	mini-wheats.
89440	93000	I'll get to my favorite cereal in a minute, and yes, we'll talk about games too, but say
93000	95520	hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
95520	96520	Hi.
96520	97520	Hi.
97520	98520	How are you, Loki?
98520	99520	I'm fine.
99520	101720	I'm finishing my last piece of honey barbecue chicken.
101720	104600	What was your favorite cereal growing up, honey barbecue chicken nuggets?
104600	105600	Hell no.
105600	107200	Actually, you know, it's kind of funny.
107200	109240	I like both extremes of cereal.
109240	112760	Like, really bad for me cereal and really good for me cereal.
112760	113760	It's weird.
113760	120520	Like, I used to, and I still do, like Special K. Yes, the chick cereal.
120520	121520	It does not...
121520	122520	I forgot about that.
122520	126680	That's one of the greatest moments of this show's history was when it came out that you
126680	128360	enjoyed Special K.
128360	129360	It's pretty good, actually.
129360	130360	Cereal for women.
130360	131360	It's not bad.
131360	137340	You know, Special K, I actually, long time ago, I used to like Total and Product 19.
137340	141160	You know what got me hooked on that stuff is, you know how they used to give you, like,
141160	146160	when you buy the camping packs of the little cereals and stuff like that, and you'd be
146160	149440	left, after you eat all the good ones, you're left with, like, okay, Special K and stuff.
149440	150440	And they're not bad.
150440	152600	I mean, so it kind of got me hooked on that.
152600	157200	But on the other side of the spectrum, and I go through about a box of this a week, Cap'n
157200	158200	Crunch.
158200	159200	Really?
159200	162200	The one that is always last in the package for me is Lucky Charms.
162200	164000	I hate Lucky Charms.
164000	168800	And well, Cinnamon Toes Crunch, but here's the thing about Cinnamon Toes Crunch, I hate
168800	169800	it with milk.
169800	174680	So I have to eat it dry, and it's just really, because all the cinnamon falls off.
174680	176760	I don't like cereal with milk at all.
176760	178280	I eat all my cereal dry.
178280	181600	Like I know that's really weird to some people, but that's how I do it.
181600	185120	You know, the other one is really addicting?
185120	187760	Was it Golden Grahams?
187760	189400	I can't stop eating that stuff.
189400	194200	Now, you can't have a video game show and talk about cereal without bringing up Nintendo
194200	195200	cereal.
195200	196280	Did anyone ever try that when they were younger?
196280	197280	I liked it.
197280	198280	I thought it was hideous.
198280	199280	Really?
199280	200280	I didn't mind it.
200280	201280	I thought it was pretty good.
201280	202280	I didn't like kid cereals.
202280	203280	I hated marshmallows.
203280	204280	I still hate marshmallows.
204280	207640	Nintendo cereal was closest probably to Froot Loops, because I still remember it was more
207640	209480	like fruity and sugary.
209480	210480	I think that would be the taste it was close to.
210480	212240	See, Froot Loops weren't really big on my plate either.
212240	213240	I mean, they were okay.
213240	216560	I just, I didn't like- I don't remember Nintendo cereal having marshmallows.
216560	217560	I don't think it did.
217560	219520	Let's break into the shredded wheat.
219520	223440	I would say my favorite breakfast cereal of all time, and this might surprise some people,
223440	224440	is Crispix.
224440	226160	Oh, Crispix is good.
226160	227160	That's the one that's-
227160	228160	I fucking love Crispix.
228160	229720	That's like half rice on one side, half corn on the other.
229720	230720	Oh, that stuff's good.
230720	231720	And gluten-free.
231720	232720	I don't know what it is.
232720	233720	It's amazing.
233720	234720	It's my favorite cereal.
234720	235720	It's not even a sugar candy cereal.
235720	237120	Damn, I need to get a box of that.
237120	238680	It's so good.
238680	239680	It's the texture.
239680	242680	Like, I can't- it's so gross, but it's the truth.
242680	246480	Like, I love putting Crispix and then, like, using my tongue to smash it to little bits.
246480	247800	I'm like, haha, and then eat it.
247800	249200	I used to do that, too.
249200	251520	Everybody does it, just no one talks about it.
251520	254360	And then I would eat one half of one side, and then eat the other half.
254360	257240	It's like eating an Oreo with no cream filling.
257240	258240	It's with milk filling.
258240	259680	I remember when they first brought Crispix out.
259680	266560	I mean, that was something that came out later on in my life.
266560	267760	Dark Tetsuya in our chat room.
267760	269440	Of course, we have to introduce the chat room.
269440	270760	We love the chatters.
270760	272860	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
272860	276160	Dark Tetsuya wants to know, are there any cereal podcasts out there?
276160	280200	I don't know, but maybe we need to start one.
280200	281320	We'll have to look for one.
281320	282400	I don't know.
282400	285800	And many folks in our chat room agree- Yes, there's one called the Ethereal Cereal
285800	286800	Podcast.
286800	287800	Shut up.
287800	288800	Really?
288800	289800	I just found it.
289800	290800	Is it really about breakfast cereal?
290800	291800	That's what I'm going to find out.
291800	292800	Or maybe it's just a funny name.
292800	293800	Alright.
293800	296640	Well, anyhow, we will talk plenty more about breakfast cereal.
296640	298000	There's one called Get Cereal.
298000	299000	Food and everything.
299000	300520	But we have to talk about our gaming weeks.
300520	302200	We've got to bring it back to video games.
302200	303200	It is a new year.
303200	304200	It's 2011.
304200	309360	It's kind of a tiny, tiny lull in new games right now, because everyone I think is catching
309360	311960	up from last year's games.
311960	314480	But things are going to hit the ground fast.
314480	316860	Little Big Planet 2, I believe, is this week.
316860	319800	And that's just going to be the first in several huge, huge releases.
319800	320800	Oh, next week.
320800	321800	Loki's correcting me.
321800	323280	I knew it was January, mid, somewhere.
323280	327140	But very soon, that's going to come out, and that's kind of the first of several bing-bing-bing
327140	328140	big stuff coming out.
328140	329140	DC Universes this week.
329140	330140	Oh, yeah.
330140	331140	DC Universes this week.
331140	332140	Thank you, Loki.
332140	333140	So I'm going to be quitting World of Warcraft.
333140	337720	When I played the beta on PC, I had a good time with it.
337720	342240	So I never did get around to playing the PS3 one, and they pulled the plug on it.
342240	343640	So I'm torn.
343640	346920	I don't know if I really want to get into DC Universe or not.
346920	348640	But anyway, I guess we can talk about that later.
348640	350880	Let's talk about what's going on right now in your gaming week.
350880	352080	Dark Sakura, start us off.
352080	356120	I hit level 63 right before the show.
356120	357820	I just can't believe this.
357820	360640	You hated World of Warcraft three weeks ago.
360640	361640	They changed it.
361640	362640	You know what's funny?
362640	365320	The podcast is behind right now, and I totally apologize.
365320	366320	That's my fault.
366320	369720	I've just been, you know, slacking, whatever.
369720	376380	But if you go listen to the last show on the feed right now, I'm pretty sure you were still
376380	379320	hating on World of Warcraft and Razami for playing it.
379320	384880	So podcaster-only people have no idea that you have now leveled to 63.
384880	387800	Not last week, because last week was after I got back from Washington.
387800	390120	No, the last show on the archives was-
390120	392840	Oh, on the archives, yeah, yeah, no.
392840	398480	Well, they changed enough in it that I was like, okay, I gotta give it a try.
398480	404120	Because you know me, I'm not gonna bitch about something without having tried it myself.
404120	405120	Good.
405120	406600	I think that's a good thing to do.
406600	409200	I mean, and besides that, I just like fucking with you guys, you know?
409200	410200	No, I know, I know.
410200	413840	It's just like I mess with you for some of the things you like, but secretly it's all
413840	414840	right.
414840	415840	It's fine.
415840	417760	Which for the record, I haven't touched Second Life since the last time I said I haven't
417760	418760	touched Second Life.
418760	421840	And for the record, Grape Nuts aren't so bad.
421840	422840	They're actually pretty good.
422840	423840	Grape Nuts are great.
423840	424840	They're great!
424840	425840	Anyway.
425840	429440	I, on the other hand, think Grape Nuts are nasty, and you really shouldn't touch Second
429440	432120	Life ever.
432120	433920	Some things never change on this program.
433920	442280	So anyway, anyway, um, I, well, okay, I know last week, live, I, you know, mentioned that
442280	447200	I had really hurt my lower back, my, it was technically my right hip.
447200	448200	Really bad.
448200	451720	Although it's more funny to say I sprained my butt, because really it's-
451720	454080	You broke your butt, ugh!
454080	459880	But, um, I've been seeing my chiropractor, like, I have one more appointment to go to,
459880	463820	and it still hurts, but it's not nearly as the debilitating pain I was in before.
463820	469840	So like, all I could do is just sit here, on an ice pack, and play World of Warcraft,
469840	470840	because what else was there for me to do?
470840	475240	I've done everything in Star Trek Online, and I still love Star Trek Online so much,
475240	477680	but all I was doing was freaking playing Dabo.
477680	480800	And there's only so much gambling one can do.
480800	483720	I really like this point in our chat room here from Salacious Pop.
483720	488640	In my opinion, this just proves that Blizzard properly redid the experience in Cata, which
488640	489640	was the point.
489640	492240	1-60 was still from 2004 and shitty.
492240	495000	If Jamie likes it now, then they really gave it an overhaul.
495000	496000	Yeah.
496000	499960	Well, and now Dan was like, oh, they dumbed it down for people so that people can, you
499960	503060	know, have a more rewarding experience, and blah blah blah.
503060	506720	And I was like, you know, when I first, when I first started playing, this was, you know,
506720	508960	when I got Burning Crusade.
508960	511820	When it was new.
511820	515080	It was like, okay, I've done everything, I'm not going anywhere.
515080	517800	I've done all this, I'm not going anywhere.
517800	518960	Fucking boring.
518960	523260	Same gameplay over and over and over and over and nothing interesting.
523260	524840	And I think that's a big part of the change too.
524840	527820	I don't want to go too far into this, because again, we have the Separate Warcraft show
527820	531480	now that, you know, because we talk too much about it on this show, but it's important
531480	535520	because where Warcraft goes, like it or not, it is the biggest MMO right now.
535520	540000	The rest of the industry will follow, you know, with some exceptions, which we'll get
540000	541160	into even later in the show.
541160	548420	But my point, in Old Vanilla WoW, a lot of the quests were fetch me animal pelts, kill
548420	549760	X number of monsters.
549760	550760	And they still have a lot of that.
550760	555460	And there is a lot of that, but they've also mixed in a lot of more interesting technology
555460	558240	from the newer expansions, like vehicle stuff from Rapid Listing.
558240	561600	Use this item to scrape tar off this creature's ass.
561600	562800	Yes, things like that.
562800	564160	You know what I'm talking about too, don't you?
564160	567000	Uh, no one, because I haven't done that quest, but did you get to dig through the poop for
567000	568000	the key?
568000	569000	No.
569000	570000	That quest I did.
570000	571000	I did see the one.
571000	572560	Okay, now Tiara showed me this one.
572560	578160	It was where you go to, um, oh crap, what's the, not the Outlands, but the place where
578160	579160	everything's red.
579160	581480	It has the big scar.
581480	582480	Barrens?
582480	583480	Badlands.
583480	584480	Okay.
584480	585480	Oh.
585480	589280	And, because keep in mind, I'm still learning what everything's called, so.
589280	597000	And um, and you run into a gnome, a dwarf, and uh, uh, something else.
597000	598240	A pizza place?
598240	599240	No.
599240	600240	And they, no they don't.
600240	601240	I see what you did there.
601240	605400	And it's not a setup for a bad joke, but it's like, the dwarf is like, I went up to Death
605400	610000	Winger and I punched him in the face!
610000	612800	I was watching this video of this guy playing through it and he was doing all the voices
612800	616680	and everything, and I was like, this is the funniest shit I've ever seen.
616680	620880	And then the gnome was like, oh yeah, well I shrunk the world and looked for him in the
620880	624800	clouds, and then I threw him on that other continent, so nah.
624800	629200	And then the last one's like, I got on my motorcycle and picked up some hot babes, and
629200	630360	we had a tender moment.
630360	633520	Oh, that's the one where one of the hot babes is a blood elf male.
633520	634520	Yeah.
634520	635520	I remember that, yeah.
635520	636520	Alright, I've seen that.
636520	637520	Yeah.
637520	638520	Good times.
638520	642040	Um, but it was, it was just, but basically they were all telling tall tales and it was
642040	643040	really funny.
643040	644040	It was cute.
644040	646880	What I like is that there's a lot more comedy thrown in there.
646880	652240	It's like the quest to have the names that make me laugh my ass off.
652240	656360	And I'm still pissed off at that stupid dragon for setting the world on fire and not setting
656360	658040	me on fire.
658040	659440	Stupid fucking dragon.
659440	661040	You were, you were online with me for this.
661040	662040	I was.
662040	664360	And you're like, I'm standing in the fire and not dying.
664360	665360	What is wrong?
665360	669980	I took a screen capture of me in the fire not dying.
669980	672160	I wanted the damn achievement.
672160	674400	And then I got, I got achievements that you don't have.
674400	675400	Whatever.
675400	676400	Thanks to X-Link.
676400	677400	No one, Ker.
677400	678400	Alright.
678400	679760	What else besides wow have you been playing?
679760	683240	Well, also thank you for the thing that you sort of were in on.
683240	684360	You're welcome.
684360	685360	I got 800 gold.
685360	687360	I'm gonna go buy me a bird.
687360	692280	Um, no, I was playing other stuff, um, though it was really solitaire.
692280	693280	And Mushihime Sama!
693280	696240	Cause that game is crack.
696240	700760	I tell you, Cave fans, if you want a little fun, uh, it's still bullet hell.
700760	703000	It's just bullet hell with running.
703000	707040	And like, you target stuff and then you let your things fall but you still have to avoid
707040	708040	the bullet.
708040	709040	It's, it's bullet hell.
709040	710720	It's bullet hell on feet.
710720	712160	Well hell.
712160	713160	It's great.
713160	714160	Alright.
714160	715160	Loki, how was your gaming week?
715160	716160	Um, it was okay.
716160	719440	Um, I played a few different things this week.
719440	723080	Um, I played The Flying Hamster, which is pretty awesome.
723080	729040	It was a game that was a PSP mini at one point and I just brought it over to the iOS platform
729040	734200	and it's a kind of a shooter game where you play a chibi flying hamster who has to save
734200	739960	his hamster girlfriend or something like that and it's a shooter and it's really hard actually
739960	742280	but it's all chibi and it's kind of cool.
742280	743960	So I played that.
743960	746760	And then, uh, more Sword and Poker 2.
746760	748880	I'm actually almost done with that game.
748880	755760	I'm in the last dungeon and I'm maybe six floors in, so that's pretty cool.
755760	759040	Um, what else did I play?
759040	763880	I think I played a little bit more, uh, Cannibalt, which is fun.
763880	766600	Um, what else?
766600	768320	Oh yeah.
768320	773720	And then more Grand Theft Auto, but finally after working on it for six months we got
773720	779840	our new modded games running again and I tell you that first game is the most fun I've had
779840	783560	playing Grand Theft Auto in six months.
783560	790720	It's just so incredibly different because the last, just the normal prank games that
790720	796400	we play and stuff, I'm very concerned about winning and a lot of time my co-workers, I
796400	801800	should say almost all the time, my co-workers aren't having as much fun as they could be
801800	804680	having because I usually am kicking the crap out of them.
804680	810900	Um, whereas the mod games, everybody has fun and it's just so over the top, like I was
810900	815120	hysterically laughing throughout the whole game because just all this crazy shit was
815120	818860	happening and it was just, it was awesome.
818860	822000	So I'm looking forward to playing more of that.
822000	828520	This time though we hot swapped all of our drives so we don't get banned, or so our consoles
828520	831000	don't get banned this time.
831000	835920	I'm pretty fast at it now, I can hot swap a console in about 15 minutes, it's like field
835920	837920	stripping a gun or something.
837920	844520	It's pretty quick, um, so yeah I played that and then um, actually looking forward to playing
844520	848080	some new games soon, hopefully, well I'm going to pick up a little big planet.
848080	853260	I have the collector's edition on order because I want those bookends and the little stuffed
853260	861760	plush sack boy for my desk and then um, actually that's probably going to be the new thing
861760	862760	I'm going to play for a while.
862760	867660	I am going to actually finally update my console now that certain hacks have come out that
867660	873360	allow custom firmwares and whatnot, so, on any firmware console, yeah.
873360	879880	You want to get Linux on your good ol' PS3 again, huh?
879880	884120	I don't really want even Linux and here's the thing is I had the opportunity to actually
884120	890140	you know, mod my console to where I could pirate games on it, but I just didn't want
890140	895480	to pirate games on the PS3 and that's saying something.
895480	898280	And it's not a good something.
898280	902440	Alright, uh, let's see, moving on to my gaming week.
902440	905360	Sadly I don't have a lot of new new stuff to report.
905360	909060	It's uh, I haven't had a lot of money to buy a lot of extra games lately so it's mostly
909060	913560	the same stuff I was talking about last week with Fallout 3 and continuing on White Knight
913560	917600	Chronicles a little more, although I have to admit the online stuff still doesn't make
917600	921200	sense to me, but whatever, at least my internet is somewhat cooperating so I can keep a connection
921200	922760	to PlayStation Network now.
922760	923760	So that's nice.
923760	926760	So I guess I'll dip in a little bit and talk about some iPhone games that I've checked
926760	929440	out recently.
929440	933040	One of them that I think you guys would like, and this was something that somebody had shouted
933040	937560	out to me on Twitter and I so apologize because I forgot who sent this to me on Twitter, but
937560	943300	it's a game called VGMC or Video Game Music Challenge and it's free on the App Store and
943300	949880	all it is is it plays like theme songs from old school video games and you're given options
949880	953160	on the screen and you have to guess what the song is.
953160	955220	For example, want to play along guys?
955220	956720	Let's see how well you guys do.
956720	960600	So I'm in the menu of Video Game Music Challenge right now and let's see how well you guys
960600	961600	do.
961600	962600	Here's the first one.
962600	963600	Ready?
963600	964600	Anyone?
964600	965600	Anyone know this one?
965600	966600	This one's hard.
966600	967600	I'm going to try Paperboy.
967600	968600	Correct.
968600	983320	Here's another one.
983320	984320	Mario 3, right?
984320	985320	Yeah.
985320	986320	So that probably doesn't pick up on the speaker.
986320	989240	It's all kind of middied.
989240	990240	A little bit.
990240	991240	Yeah.
991240	992240	It's not like the original, original stuff, but it's all middied.
992240	993240	But hey, it was free.
993240	994240	So I think that's kind of cool.
994240	995240	I did play that too.
995240	996240	I forgot.
996240	997240	Did you?
997240	998240	Yes.
998240	999240	Yeah.
999240	1002840	I played a little bit of Cut the Rope, the holiday edition, which is this really popular
1002840	1003840	iPhone game.
1003840	1004840	It's Cut the Rope.
1004840	1008860	But I'm cheap and I like to have a lot of the free demos before I buy games and so they
1008860	1010920	have this holiday edition that's free.
1010920	1012760	And it's basically a puzzle game.
1012760	1016400	But the cutest thing about it, and I think everyone would agree, would be the little
1016400	1021360	monster character that you're trying to feed the candy to, Om Nom Nom, is adorable.
1021360	1025000	And you have to like feed him the candy by choosing which ropes to cut.
1025000	1029720	And it's kind of like a gravity physics puzzler type of thing.
1029720	1030720	So it's fun.
1030720	1032240	I like that.
1032240	1035320	Tap Tap Revenge 4 is also out on the iTunes store.
1035320	1037440	That's one of those like you tap along to songs.
1037440	1041560	I'm going to admit, I used to like Tap Tap Revenge.
1041560	1042840	I don't like it anymore.
1042840	1047840	I think it really has become something, it's outgrown what it was.
1047840	1052640	In the first couple versions it was cool, but now it's all commercialized and it's about
1052640	1053640	selling the music.
1053640	1058560	And the interface is impossible to navigate because they're trying to push all these add-on
1058560	1064020	songs for money and it's like it's too hard to just get in there and like play a game.
1064020	1065020	The interface is shit.
1065020	1067060	I'm sorry, I don't have a nice way of saying it.
1067060	1072840	Like they have just destroyed the game because they're trying too hard to build this music
1072840	1074560	store around it.
1074560	1079760	And I don't need all this, I don't really like all this other bullshit like Open Faint
1079760	1082880	and I don't even like Game Center and some of this other stuff.
1082880	1086280	Like I really wish there was just one for all of it.
1086280	1093400	And to be honest, as much as I like Open Faint and what it's trying to do, we need one standard
1093400	1095360	across all the iPhone games.
1095360	1100680	And I think Apple ought to just step in and say, it's Game Center and get the fuck out.
1100680	1103360	We're going to stop approving your apps if it has any other shit in it.
1103360	1106760	Like I know that's like a terrible thing to say because Game Center is like the worst
1106760	1111380	of all of them, but maybe they can work with the Open Faint people, I don't know.
1111380	1114760	But I think it's ridiculous that you have like all these different games and they have
1114760	1115760	all these different adults.
1115760	1116760	They should just buy and absorb Open Faint.
1116760	1118540	Or something, I don't know.
1118540	1120880	So there's a lot of people that are going to really hate that I said that, but it's
1120880	1121880	just annoying.
1121880	1123680	I'm kind of, I kind of don't like either of them though.
1123680	1128640	I hate all these freaking pop-ups when I start games, sign up for Open Faint, sign up for
1128640	1129640	this network.
1129640	1130640	Mine's like...
1130640	1131640	No!
1131640	1134040	I have an iPhone so I don't have to play with other people.
1134040	1135040	You know?
1135040	1136040	Yeah.
1136040	1137040	So...
1137040	1140720	Hey, let your friends on Twitter and Facebook know that you're playing an Open Faint game.
1140720	1144280	I will post on Facebook if I want them to know I'm playing this game.
1144280	1146080	Like, it's getting to be too much.
1146080	1149840	I want a Facebook update every time I score a point.
1149840	1150840	No.
1150840	1152720	No, no, no.
1152720	1156240	And then, believe it or not, I downloaded Smurf Village on the iPhone.
1156240	1157720	It's stupid.
1157720	1158720	It's a Facebook game.
1158720	1162040	If you like those Facebook grindy games, then have fun.
1162040	1166800	I prefer Knights of the Clicky on Facebook, which, by the way, I got Xtiver to play, or
1166800	1169720	he played it, I don't know, because he heard one of us talking about it, and he said it
1169720	1173100	was the worst thing he'd ever played in his life.
1173100	1174100	Because Knights of the Crystal...
1174100	1175880	There really is no point in Knights of the Crystal.
1175880	1177720	It's Mafia Wars with Final Fantasy characters.
1177720	1179240	I pretty much stopped playing it.
1179240	1185040	I mean, I'm playing it some, like when I remember to, but when I was in Washington, I was like,
1185040	1188480	I couldn't keep up with it on my laptop, so I was like, eh.
1188480	1192320	Yeah, you kind of echo a lot of people that are kind of done with Knights of the Clicky.
1192320	1196360	Like once you beat that final boss, you can kind of grind old quests and stuff, but there's
1196360	1197800	not a lot else to do.
1197800	1202320	Now they did just recently release, I can't believe I'm talking about a Facebook game.
1202320	1203520	They released some new levels.
1203520	1210440	We really do need an official Knights of the Clicky starring Clicky the Pen.
1210440	1215520	A different show on the network owns the rights to that character, so we'll have to get agreements
1215520	1216760	and contracts.
1216760	1219320	You know, I haven't gotten to the last boss because I've actually been going through for
1219320	1223440	Gold Mastery on other levels, and now I'm like, this is boring!
1223440	1225440	What the crap am I doing?
1225440	1227300	I'm done.
1227300	1230040	Some comments in our chat room, some talk about Steam and Apple.
1230040	1234080	William Murderface says, Apple needs to get in bed with Steam already.
1234080	1235900	Act Def says Apple kind of already did that.
1235900	1237920	That's when Portal came out for free.
1237920	1238920	And that's true.
1238920	1240920	Steam is on the Apple system now, so.
1240920	1245320	Yeah, it's good for them, but I mean, no, Apple doesn't need to buy Steam.
1245320	1248880	There was some other big news in the Apple world, and we'll talk about that because we
1248880	1250680	have to, because it does affect video games.
1250680	1254040	We're going to talk about that a little later on in the program, but we'll wait until we
1254040	1255040	get there.
1255040	1257720	So, I really don't have anything else to share with my gaming week.
1257720	1260120	Not a lot of new console stuff, unfortunately.
1260120	1262120	It's been a little slow.
1262120	1266440	But hopefully as some of the new releases come out, I'll be picking them up and excited
1266440	1267440	about that.
1267440	1271480	I also really want to get LittleBigPlanet 2, so I think I'm going to have to do that.
1271480	1274840	Anyhow, let's move on into some housekeeping tonight.
1274840	1280400	No show stuff as far as I know, although I will say, it looks like we can kind of project
1280400	1286120	now when episode number 400 will be, although we have yet to plan anything special for it.
1286120	1293200	But if tonight is episode 396, then 397, 398, 399, episode number 400 of Orange Law and
1293200	1297720	Trade Deal will be February 6th of this year, assuming we do not miss any shows between
1297720	1298720	now and then.
1298720	1301800	Or do not have a show at 399 and a half.
1301800	1302920	So I don't know what's going to happen.
1302920	1307080	I know we had talked a while about maybe doing it at a pizza parlor or something and trying
1307080	1308640	to get some of the old crew together.
1308640	1313680	I don't know if that's feasible, but we'll try to do something fun for episode 400.
1313680	1315600	We're thinking about what we're going to do for that.
1315600	1319960	So that's really the only thing, because I don't know if there's a lot of gaming podcasts
1319960	1322160	that have hit episode 400 that are weekly.
1322160	1325840	I'm sure some daily ones have, but I don't know about any other weekly shows.
1325840	1329960	So if there are, I don't know of them, which would be a surprise at this point, because
1329960	1333080	that means you have to be doing a show for at least eight, nine years like we have.
1333080	1337600	So yeah, we'll be kind of doing something a little special for episode 400.
1337600	1339120	We just don't know what yet.
1339120	1342080	In good OLR fashion, we're procrastinating.
1342080	1347560	Otherwise, you can join us on Facebook, porn, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
1347560	1349000	Or how about another marathon episode?
1349000	1350760	You like those, right?
1350760	1355600	Or twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.
1355600	1358400	How about we get into some gaming news?
1358400	1360560	Hokies, start us off tonight with some gaming news.
1360560	1361560	Yes.
1361560	1367440	So of course, there's some information, I mean, slightly before when the US announcement
1367440	1376200	and stuff comes out on the 19th, but some stuff about the 3DS launch in Japan.
1376200	1382440	They've announced 10 titles that are going to be expected for launch, I guess the Japanese
1382440	1385440	launch date will be February 26th.
1385440	1393780	And the titles you can expect, Winning Eleven 3DS, or 3D Soccer, get it, 3DS, Super Street
1393780	1405720	Fighter 4 3D Edition, Samurai Warriors Chronicle, looks like, Tobi Dasu, Puzzle Bobble 3D, Nintendogs
1405720	1414080	Plus Cats, wow, they're going to do 3 versions of that too, Toy Poodle and New Friends, French
1414080	1420940	Bulldog and New Friends, and Shiba and New Friends, yes, I will not be stupid this time
1420940	1427000	and buy all 3 versions, actually, I'll be smart this time and not buy any version, Ridge
1427000	1436200	Racer 3D, I don't know, I kinda want the kitties, I want the kitties too, Ridge Racer 3D, Combat
1436200	1443800	of Giants Dinosaur 3D, and Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle, so those are expected
1443800	1451240	out, also it says there's supposed to be some new titles announced as well, including
1451240	1457560	BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2, Imports of Tales of the Abyss, and Raving Rabbids Travel in
1457560	1466760	Time, as well as the third game in the Tank Beat series, so those are going to be some
1466760	1471880	launch titles, no real word on what the pricing is going to be over here yet, but in Japan
1471880	1485720	it looks like they're kind of ranging around 4980 yen to say about 6090 yen, so between
1485720	1495200	say $60 and $73 compared, well obviously it's a lot more expensive over there, I was going
1495200	1498840	to say, they're not going to be $70 games, they're not going to be $70 games here, but
1498840	1504040	they'll be more expensive than DS games won't they, they'll use the 3D thing as an excuse
1504040	1510760	to charge a $10 premium, they will, I've already said before that one of the launch titles
1510760	1518480	I've seen actually have an actual price to it is $40 retail, so it's not unheard of to
1518480	1525480	have a $40 retail DS game, but it's rare, so usually those are the Squeenix games right,
1525480	1531560	like the Final Fantasy remakes kind of got up there, sometimes, usually the cap they'll
1531560	1538880	do on DS games is about $35 retail, but there have been like one or two $40 retail games,
1538880	1545800	but I'm expecting probably a $10 increase, probably going to see everything from $40
1545800	1553560	to a $50 as a high end game would be my guess, and then of course there's some more information
1553560	1559160	regarding the battery life for the 3DS, they're saying that the 3DS has a 3 to 5 hour battery
1559160	1564560	life for playing 3DS games, of course it's going to be a little bit longer if you're
1564560	1570040	playing regular DS games, which is going to be 5 to 8 hours, and they're saying that's
1570040	1575640	probably because it doesn't have to run the third display since the two displays are interlaced
1575640	1584080	on the top screen, so that'll save a little bit of the battery, but either way, 5 to 8
1584080	1587760	hours or 3 to 5 hours, that's not too bad.
1587760	1595800	In comparison though, the DSi XL, they say that that lasts about 17 hours, so you may
1595800	1602320	have to charge it a little bit more than you would your normal systems.
1602320	1606200	So now that we know a little bit more about what the 3DS is going to be all about, I mean
1606200	1612560	granted a lot of this news that came out this week from the event was Japan, but still we're
1612560	1613560	kind of watching it here.
1613560	1619320	Well, Samurai Warriors Chronicles is coming out here, that'll be the launch title here,
1619320	1625560	Dead or Alive is going to be a launch title here, and Super Monkey Ball will be a launch
1625560	1626560	title.
1626560	1629720	So where's the hype at right now, because let me go to a comment in our chatroom at
1629720	1634400	chat.orangelaunchrader.com, Defective Candy in our chatroom says, I love Nintendo, but
1634400	1637080	I'm just not going to invest in a 3DS when it comes out.
1637080	1641240	I'm going to wait until they release a second version just to make sure all the bugs are
1641240	1642240	worked out.
1642240	1646640	And I think that's a good question to ask, where's the hype meter now for the 3DS?
1646640	1650600	Because are you guys interested in buying one now, or are you kind of where Defective
1650600	1655440	Candy's at, where you're like, you know what, there is always inevitably the GBA with the
1655440	1659840	backlight, the DS Lite, the second iteration of the handheld that comes out later.
1659840	1663680	Yeah, but here's the thing with me, and the DS Lite and all that stuff, I didn't really
1663680	1665680	care about the DS Lite.
1665680	1670920	I guess the only iteration would be like the DSi, that was slightly different where they
1670920	1677160	actually had like SD storage, and you know, the cameras on it and stuff like that.
1677160	1679240	That's a little different.
1679240	1683720	And I don't know if you'd even consider that like a different system almost, but it pretty
1683720	1685960	much was.
1685960	1690280	Sadly it won't ever be utilized, and remember they were going to be having DSi only games,
1690280	1693320	and there was a handful of those, but they were kind of crap.
1693320	1696840	A lot of them were crap, it was just unlock extra stuff that there's really no reason
1696840	1699200	we shut out of the regular DS version.
1699200	1700200	Exactly.
1700200	1709800	So I don't know, I'm actually planning on getting one at launch, and really, you know,
1709800	1712680	they haven't announced any launch titles yet, but I know one of the titles that they were
1712680	1718840	working on that was supposed to be for the 3DS was the New Excite Truck Game, and I'm
1718840	1723600	telling you, if they have a New Excite Truck Game at launch, I will not be able to resist.
1723600	1728920	No, but I am planning on getting one at launch, and just because I don't really care about
1728920	1735240	the reiterations that come out later on, unless they add major features to them, it doesn't
1735240	1741040	really matter to me that they shrink down the size of the system, or they, you know,
1741040	1744880	make the system bigger, and they have a different color.
1744880	1749640	I don't care, because remember, those first systems are more exploitable than the other
1749640	1753800	systems, so that's really what I care about.
1753800	1759000	See here's where I'm at with the 3DS, like I am kind of with you skeptics, like it's
1759000	1763520	inevitable that once you buy this, they're going to announce a new one next year.
1763520	1769260	Like that is absolutely going to happen, it happens with every Apple product, it's a thing
1769260	1771400	of technology.
1771400	1775520	Here's and I'm really going to make myself sound like an a-hole by saying this, but here's
1775520	1778760	where I'm coming from that a lot of you aren't coming from.
1778760	1783760	I've seen the 3DS, and I've played the 3DS, and like I swear I'm not saying that to
1783760	1788400	be a jerk, but I'm telling you, I'm saying that because when you see this technology
1788400	1795720	for the first time, and you're like, I'm looking at 3D with no glasses, it kind of
1795720	1797720	takes you back for a minute.
1797720	1801520	And I think when they start putting these kiosks in stores and so forth, I think they're
1801520	1804880	going to win a lot of people over, and I think there's going to be a lot of people that
1804880	1809760	kind of put the, you know, oh well there'll be a new one next year aside, because they're
1809760	1811360	going to want something like this now.
1811360	1814560	Not just for the games, but for the things like the movies, and some of the other things
1814560	1817600	that they're promising they're going to do, the cameras and so forth.
1817600	1820200	I got to say, I really want one.
1820200	1824120	Here's the thing too about the 3DS, is it's really kind of pushing some technology here
1824120	1825560	that we don't see yet.
1825560	1826640	Nintendo does this.
1826640	1832080	They grasp new technology, and at the same time they don't embrace new technology sometimes.
1832080	1837000	With the Wii, the whole motion control thing, that was really ahead of the game there.
1837000	1839260	And then everybody was kind of playing catch up with that.
1839260	1843320	But their network support, not quite where it is with everybody else.
1843320	1847820	The 3DS, the technology's there, it's great that they're going to be doing all these cool
1847820	1849080	things with it.
1849080	1856140	I'm not so much of a fan of them re-releasing Nintendo 64 games supporting the 3DS.
1856140	1857140	Come on!
1857140	1862040	Seriously, you've been pulling this shit since the GameCube.
1862040	1866240	It's just ridiculous to have these re-release games, but whatever.
1866240	1871320	But here's the thing, is if this comes out and it's extremely popular, say they announce
1871320	1876960	the PSP2, okay great, the PSP2's going to have some pretty cool hardware behind it,
1876960	1879700	but what's it really going to do?
1879700	1883420	Has a trackpad on it, ooh, ooh, touchpad.
1883420	1886480	You're really catching up with everybody.
1886480	1890440	Well I don't want to sound like a broken record on this show, but I always think the PSP's
1890440	1895840	strength was not just as a gaming system, but as a comprehensive multimedia device.
1895840	1896840	They're really kind of expanding.
1896840	1898320	And that's what the 3DS doesn't have.
1898320	1903040	I don't look at the 3DS going, I'm going to be able to browse the web in 3D, no I'm not.
1903040	1907900	But they're saying though that, for example, they were talking at CES during their keynote
1907900	1912680	that they're having Sony tablets, they're having, well they didn't really come out and
1912680	1915880	say the PSP phone, but they're going to have the PSP phone.
1915880	1919400	They're going to have the PSP2 probably at some point soon.
1919400	1925240	So I don't think they really care too much, the fact that they can do all this stuff,
1925240	1928640	because pretty much everything now is doing all that stuff.
1928640	1931540	You can browse the web with any device almost.
1931540	1932540	Except the DS.
1932540	1935240	Uh huh, well I guess you can, and not very well.
1935240	1936240	Just not well.
1936240	1939680	Alright, let me go to the chatroom at chat.orangehelger.com, because there's some interesting discussion
1939680	1941120	going on here that I want to bring up.
1941120	1945420	Gamergirl kind of started the thing off by saying, I hate 3D, I can't watch that shit.
1945420	1953060	And SolarFlare says, 3D is a fad, and CSCR, SMAT 454, sorry I don't know what the preferred
1953060	1955480	name is there, wait for a price drop.
1955480	1956480	Hmm.
1956480	1957480	Well here's the thing.
1957480	1959640	Can I say this real quick though?
1959640	1964440	I also think, I'm getting a little sick of the whole 3Ds in the movie thing, because
1964440	1967600	I think most movies don't benefit from it.
1967600	1968600	Tron sure did.
1968600	1971240	Yeah, but then I'm like, but Tron was actually really awesome in 3D.
1971240	1973640	I thought Avatar was great in 3D.
1973640	1978280	You know, and it's so difficult, like, I am, but I think there's too much, like Gulliver's
1978280	1983560	Travel's 3D, no thanks, not gonna bother, do not want, but even something like Tangled
1983560	1984560	was really cute.
1984560	1985560	But here's the thing though.
1985560	1989800	Gulliver's Travel is not a movie targeted at you Rob, it's targeted at little kids that
1989800	1990800	like Jack White.
1990800	1994200	Well it missed its target because it didn't do very well at the box office.
1994200	2000360	Well that's the thing, it's a gamble, I mean that's something, Jack Black does not put
2000360	2008000	people in the seats anymore, I don't know, but it's, speaking of which, I am gonna sneak
2008000	2016120	out to the theaters to see Tron one last time, in D-Box, in D-Box, because Friday the 14th
2016120	2020120	is the last day that they will have, actually no that will be the cutoff because they're
2020120	2028560	gonna be getting a new D-Box movie which is, what the fuck is it, it's that Seth Rogen
2028560	2029560	one.
2029560	2030560	The Green Lantern.
2030560	2031560	No, no, Green Hornet.
2031560	2032560	Green Hornet, yeah.
2032560	2033560	Green blank.
2033560	2034560	The Green Hornet.
2034560	2037800	Yes, I need to, I am sneaking out this week during, during, during.
2037800	2041600	Okay, here's the thing I want to say though, because I am totally in that camp where I
2041600	2045960	also think we're starting to get a little much with the 3D, and I was very skeptical
2045960	2049680	going into the 3DS, but seeing that technology for the first time without the glasses was
2049680	2053960	pretty amazing, and I have to admit my favorite part, and this is something the movies don't
2053960	2058520	give you, my favorite part was that there's a little slider where you can adjust the intensity
2058520	2064860	of the 3D, so it can be like, you know, kind of pulling on the eyes to, forget it, 2D.
2064860	2066960	Just throw the 3D out and have 2D.
2066960	2069720	So it's interesting to me that developers are gonna have to consider that, that some
2069720	2073280	people are gonna want to play 3D, and someone to play 2D.
2073280	2078440	The reason why I'm excited about the 3D, I want to see where it's gonna take games, because,
2078440	2084400	you know, things like Doom, Quake, even things like Zelda, when they first came out, they
2084400	2087040	were called 3D games.
2087040	2089000	This whole virtual reality.
2089000	2094040	And I think now that we have real 3D technology, I'm really curious to see where that's gonna
2094040	2096940	take the gaming and interaction technology.
2096940	2097940	That's where I'm at.
2097940	2098940	Sorry, Loki, I cut you off like five minutes.
2098940	2102400	Well, and then on the other thing is they don't have to necessarily use the 3DS top
2102400	2107680	screen as a 3D screen, they can use it as an HD 2D screen because you have twice the
2107680	2110160	resolution now to play around with.
2110160	2113160	They don't have to actually interlace it to do 3D.
2113160	2118400	So I think there's a lot of potential to do some really good-looking games, and the games
2118400	2119520	on it look really good.
2119520	2124520	I mean, like, the Dead or Live game looks like a console Dead or Live game, you know,
2124520	2129760	Street Fighter IV looks like console Street Fighter IV, so it's not bad.
2129760	2132460	And I think that's another point that a lot of people are forgetting is that we're all
2132460	2137560	talking about 3D, yes, but in 2D, the graphics are better than they are on the DS.
2137560	2138920	It is a graphical upgrade.
2138920	2141600	It's not just a DS recycled.
2141600	2144600	There is graphical and hardware upgrades with this thing.
2144600	2145600	So.
2145600	2147040	Well, we'll see.
2147040	2151840	I mean, you know, I'm curious to know more details about what the US is getting.
2151840	2155360	I was very surprised to hear that there is no pack-in at all.
2155360	2158520	And we haven't heard what the new Mario game's gonna be.
2158520	2160400	Can you imagine a new Mario game on this?
2160400	2161760	That'll be sexy.
2161760	2167080	I also do have to mention that for the people in the chat room who are pissing about, you
2167080	2170840	know, 3D, if you don't like it, don't see it.
2170840	2175800	Well, true, but, you know, I did ask the question, who's gonna buy this and who's not, and so
2175800	2176800	if they're not, that's fine.
2176800	2179880	Well, but I'm saying, you know, for the people who are just saying 3D is overdone, 3D is
2179880	2183960	overdone, if you don't like it, fine, don't ruin it for the people that like it.
2183960	2187400	I don't, you know, that's this thing.
2187400	2190960	If you don't want your games in 3D, don't buy a 3DS.
2190960	2195240	If you don't want your movies in 3D, don't go see them in 3D.
2195240	2198740	If you don't want to watch TV in 3D, don't get a 3D TV.
2198740	2199840	It's that easy.
2199840	2201640	Stop bitching.
2201640	2206640	But maybe there's this worry, and I think it's a valid concern, that 3D is slowly becoming
2206640	2207840	the norm.
2207840	2208840	You know?
2208840	2209840	It is gonna become the norm.
2209840	2210840	Consumer electronics show.
2210840	2214140	We don't, we didn't hear about any 2D TVs.
2214140	2218880	Maybe the one, we heard about like one 2D TV because it was like a gigantic wall-sized
2218880	2221640	television, like, I mean, wall-sized television.
2221640	2226640	But otherwise, everybody's talking about 3D, 3D, 3D TVs, 3D TVs without glasses, 3D.
2226640	2228000	3D's not going anywhere.
2228000	2231400	It's gonna be around, you know, for a while, and it will become the norm, and people will
2231400	2232480	just stop bitching about it.
2232480	2233480	It's not a fad.
2233480	2236760	But yes, here, just like- So I can see where people are concerned about
2236760	2237760	that.
2237760	2240960	But just like any emerging technology, just like with, you know, the Wii and stuff like
2240960	2245760	that, the first, you know, the first games you have on the Wii or whatever are gonna
2245760	2250880	be really cheesy, and they're gonna be just some cheap ideas to utilize the technology.
2250880	2255240	Just like the first 3D movies, you know, there's a couple good ones, and a lot of them were
2255240	2260080	just tacked on 3D to get people in the seats because it's a 3D movie.
2260080	2263480	But a lot of stuff now, a lot of movies are being filmed in 3D.
2263480	2269240	Granted, you're not gonna see, you know, I don't know, Sister of the Traveling Pants
2269240	2270240	3 in 3D.
2270240	2271680	God, let's hope not.
2271680	2276680	You know, but I think eventually everything will be in 3D, and that's just gonna be the
2276680	2277680	way it is.
2277680	2281520	You know, and when your kids, you know, you're talking to your kids about how you used to
2281520	2284360	see the 2D movies, they're like, 2D?
2284360	2286080	What are you talking about?
2286080	2287080	What is 2D?
2287080	2290280	And that's the time when the 4D dimension will be coming out, and you can watch movies
2290280	2292460	in an alternate time.
2292460	2298320	This is my issue, is that people bitched about TV when it was new.
2298320	2301640	People bitched about HDTV.
2301640	2304480	People bitched when it was time to go from 8-track to cassette.
2304480	2307040	Or VHS to DVD.
2307040	2308040	Exactly.
2308040	2311200	It's the same thing over and over.
2311200	2314160	And it's just sort of like a big inevitability.
2314160	2316880	Technology is going to progress.
2316880	2319280	I gotta play devil's advocate.
2319280	2324240	None of those technologies hurt my eyes.
2324240	2326280	That's the one downside I can see to this 3D.
2326280	2327280	Yeah.
2327280	2330720	Like, even when I go to do the 3D movies and so forth, like, I can't wear the glasses for
2330720	2331720	the whole two hours consecutively.
2331720	2332720	Yeah, but you know why, though?
2332720	2336280	That's because the technology that they have right now, there's a lot of flicker and just
2336280	2337900	they're gonna catch up.
2337900	2341120	It's the technology will get better and it'll be less harsh on your eyes.
2341120	2342120	Okay, that's fair.
2342120	2343120	Well, think about this.
2343120	2345720	Alright, look at televisions in the 80s.
2345720	2346720	Okay.
2346720	2351040	Remember those big, you know, cabinet televisions that would have that, you know, look like,
2351040	2353240	oh, there's supposed to be nice furniture and shit.
2353240	2355200	Really blurry screen quality.
2355200	2361840	Now we've got TVs that are three times those size in perfect crystal clear HD quality.
2361840	2365200	And we're talking about a span of 25 years.
2365200	2369280	So by the time I'm 50, the holodeck should be out, right?
2369280	2371660	No, I'm not saying that.
2371660	2372660	But now also...
2372660	2373660	Holodeck retirement.
2373660	2378680	But now, but if you think about it too, the growth of technology is also exponential,
2378680	2387040	you know, as the more technological advancement you get in the different fields, they're gonna
2387040	2389140	speed up the new rate of research.
2389140	2391240	The more you learn, the more you're gonna learn.
2391240	2392560	That's how I see it.
2392560	2394160	Two very interesting comments in chat.
2394160	2395160	I gotta bring up.
2395160	2399680	Bochi Kawa in our chat room says, besides, we're still playing games on the NES.
2399680	2401120	If you want new, then get new.
2401120	2403000	If you want old, play old.
2403000	2404000	Interesting.
2404000	2405000	Seriously.
2405000	2406000	And that's what we do.
2406000	2407960	We've got a whole room full of old.
2407960	2411240	And it's not to say that all technologies end up, you know, taking off.
2411240	2412240	Old is new.
2412240	2415520	Look at how much retro crap gets repackaged and comes out.
2415520	2416520	You know what I mean?
2416520	2419000	That's because all the kids have grown up and are making the games.
2419000	2420000	Fascinating.
2420000	2427800	Steve, and I don't know if this is our show or not, but can you believe that copies of
2427800	2434400	Super Mario All-Stars, the reprint that was on the Wii, are selling for $75 and $80 on
2434400	2435400	eBay?
2435400	2436400	Yeah.
2436400	2438700	Are you people fucking nuts?
2438700	2441240	Let me bring this up in chat as well, because this is another good comment.
2441240	2443680	And then I promise we can change the topic.
2443680	2448060	Mayor in our chat room says, why now versus the last 3D?
2448060	2451000	And I think that's a very legitimate question.
2451000	2453160	And I'm guessing a lot of it has to do with the technology.
2453160	2460120	Like, you know, the last time 3D was big was the mid early 80s when like Jaws 3D was out
2460120	2461400	and that stuff.
2461400	2465800	And I'm thinking there's two reasons for it.
2465800	2469240	A, that technology wasn't as good, period.
2469240	2473760	I mean, when you're talking to 3DS, again, I'm telling you guys, the first time you see
2473760	2477680	it without glasses, you do have that moment of, whoa, everybody's going to have that moment
2477680	2482380	of whoa, I'm playing this and I'm not wearing glasses and I'm seeing the 3D.
2482380	2486680	And then B, Jaws 3D was not Avatar.
2486680	2492020	And love Avatar or hate it, the fact is it's the highest grossing movie ever.
2492020	2494600	And now everybody wants to be it.
2494600	2498560	So I think those are the two big differences to me is that, you know, technology has come
2498560	2504460	a long way and a movie got to be extremely successful with the technology.
2504460	2508840	And let me tell you that Avatar didn't make its money because people liked the plot.
2508840	2510440	They wanted to see the pretty 3D.
2510440	2516760	Well, but if you also look into the actual technology that went into it, it's basically
2516760	2520920	in, you know, I think that they applied some of it to a lesser extent in Tron, remember,
2520920	2526400	with the having the 3D modeled younger face, even though he looked like, you know, plastic.
2526400	2530080	That technology still needs, still needs some work.
2530080	2535160	But I think I think what they needed was better animation.
2535160	2537640	That's what I think that that needed.
2537640	2543560	But if you stop and look at it, you're going to basically be replacing.
2543560	2547800	I mean, now, keep in mind, we were having this conversation like a while back, me and
2547800	2552680	Dan were, about how we miss, you know, matte paintings and, you know, things in movies
2552680	2555920	use like, for example, OK, I'll use Tron since I was already on it.
2555920	2559800	In the first Tron movie, when he walks into the cubicle area and there's cubicles going
2559800	2562840	on for miles, that was all matte painting.
2562840	2571400	You know, or remember V when they walked into the ship and it's, you know, the whole lines
2571400	2574880	of the storage pods going on in the back and the old one.
2574880	2576160	That was all matte painting.
2576160	2579520	My favorite was always rear projection for driving scenes.
2579520	2580520	Yeah.
2580520	2587200	But now, but now if you look at that, you're going to, I don't think that the craftsmanship
2587200	2588520	is going anywhere.
2588520	2591880	It's just moving to a different medium.
2591880	2593400	You're still going to have to have animators.
2593400	2596680	You're still going to have to have artists that are going to be able to make all of this.
2596680	2601480	And yeah, maybe you're saving in resources in paint and that type of thing.
2601480	2604720	And keep in mind, I still think nothing will replace painting.
2604720	2607160	Nothing will replace physical art.
2607160	2608160	You know what I mean?
2608160	2613760	But at the same time, I think that if you're looking in terms of pushing the envelope as
2613760	2619920	far as the experience that you can deliver in technology, in a cinematic experience or
2619920	2625360	in games or movies, anything like that, that you're going to have to start making situations
2625360	2627320	where it's cheaper to produce.
2627320	2632280	And I think that that's going to be the advantage of going with the same type of innovations
2632280	2633280	that they made with Avatar.
2633280	2639320	That's what my point was, is the fact that you could have warehouses and then send it
2639320	2646680	off to a team of animators and have this high quality product produced with some time and
2646680	2649820	effort, but you're not paying for a set.
2649820	2654480	You're not paying for makeup, you know, none of that.
2654480	2655480	That was my point.
2655480	2656480	Okay.
2656480	2657480	Okay.
2657480	2659840	That's where I see everything going with the technology developed with that.
2659840	2661980	You know, yeah, cool movie.
2661980	2665800	But I think that they need to take the same things that, you know, they can even do, keep
2665800	2668040	in mind, they can even do the same thing with video games.
2668040	2672880	You know, we've had motion capture in video games before, so keep in mind taking that
2672880	2677560	same sort of, you know, the blank set.
2677560	2683520	You can actually do all of your cinematic cut scenes with like actual actors and record
2683520	2688440	them real time, have them, you know, the layers and everything, but over it for a game and
2688440	2690800	boom, there you go.
2690800	2693280	Let me try to wrap up this topic by going back to one of the thought.
2693280	2697240	No, because it relates to what you just said about motion capture and stuff and a lot of
2697240	2700200	the other technology that's been coming out in the past few months has to do with that
2700200	2706120	when you talk about Kinect is basically kind of like a live motion capture type of thing.
2706120	2709440	Going back to the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are
2709440	2710440	on it.
2710440	2713600	And I think that's very important to remember with this whole 3DS launch as well is that
2713600	2719000	if the games are poop, you know, the pretty will wear off quickly.
2719000	2722220	I am really curious about this year's E3.
2722220	2727700	I am so, like I have to admit, like the hype going into this year's E3 is almost higher
2727700	2732600	than it's ever been because I think this is a very crucial E3.
2732600	2738160	I think it's either going to be the best show ever or it's going to be a stinker.
2738160	2740200	And I mean, easy to say, right?
2740200	2745760	But the reason why is because now you have this technology, you have Kinect, you have
2745760	2752840	Move, you have soon to be this PSP2, and you have the 3DS and, you know, all these launch
2752840	2756460	games are kind of like that obvious thing to do the technology.
2756460	2761960	All the Kinect launch games were essentially Wii knockoffs and Dance Central.
2761960	2767600	You know, all the 3DS things are these Nintendo upgrades and sort of like, you know, finally
2767600	2770120	Kid Icarus coming back and so forth.
2770120	2773280	I'm really curious now what is going to be next.
2773280	2779120	Now that these technologies are established, how are you going to take it to the next level?
2779120	2784120	What is that must-have game going to have in it that implements that technology that
2784120	2786360	just blows us away?
2786360	2790800	So I'm really interested in what's going to be brought to the table this year at E3.
2790800	2794000	And it's either going to be great or it's going to show that, you know what, we should
2794000	2798040	have never left where we were last year.
2798040	2804000	The whole 12 months have been a lie, and this whole crap is just a fad.
2804000	2805000	Very curious.
2805000	2806960	Anyhow, let's move on with some more topics.
2806960	2808960	Good discussion, but we've got plenty more to get through tonight.
2808960	2809960	So Dark Sakura.
2809960	2815360	Well, how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with 3D visuals except maybe
2815360	2816360	being rendered?
2816360	2818920	Lord of the Rings Online.
2818920	2821280	It's making a lot of money now.
2821280	2824320	Since they went free to play, and you know how we kind of left, oh, they must be sucking,
2824320	2825800	they're going free to play.
2825800	2833160	Actually, they're making three times as much revenue monthly, so that's pretty cool.
2833160	2839300	They are now doing the whole, I hate the word term, microtransaction, because a transaction
2839300	2847480	is a transaction, fuck putting a size on it, but they're using this little, you know, and
2847480	2852160	I can see doing it, I've been doing some of them in Star Trek Online when I was playing.
2852160	2857120	I bought outfits and ship packs and stuff, even with my subscription fee.
2857120	2863560	So I can see that if someone wants to make a character look a certain way, they're going
2863560	2866800	to spend all the little bits and pieces and not even see that they're nickel diming their
2866800	2870000	money right into their pocket.
2870000	2873800	And I've always said the minute this technology comes out for World of Warcraft, Horde House
2873800	2875960	is over, I'm quitting WoW.
2875960	2879760	The minute this type of stuff, and you might already say, oh Rob, you can already do it,
2879760	2884560	the mounts are da da da da, that's all superficial crap, and you know, it does not affect the
2884560	2885560	base game.
2885560	2886560	When this becomes their model.
2886560	2887560	Exactly.
2887560	2891400	If Warcraft ever implements this stuff where the stats, you know, change or you're getting
2891400	2896320	things that otherwise you grind dungeons for or whatever, Horde House is canceled and WoW
2896320	2903520	is done, as far as I'm concerned, because that's not, I like playing a game where everybody's
2903520	2906080	on an equal playing field.
2906080	2910480	Everybody's paying 15 bucks a month, everybody, you know, is on that same playing field when
2910480	2915240	it comes to the quest that you're grinding and so forth, and those that get the super
2915240	2917680	awesome items really worked for it.
2917680	2925240	However, that's not to slam this other idea, because, you know, not everything can be WoW,
2925240	2929740	and not everything can kind of command the $15 up front, and I think we've seen a lot
2929740	2935700	of the same model, oddly enough, in Facebook games, and it's worked really well.
2935700	2939880	You know, and I don't know, these games, I'm okay with the way they do it, because it's
2939880	2943560	sort of like, well you know nothing in this world is really free.
2943560	2947200	So that's how they choose to nickel and dime you instead of the cost of the game.
2947200	2951560	And so, I don't know, for some reason, I'm okay with it, but at the same time, I can't
2951560	2957640	think of any free to play games that I really play with any regularity, except one or two
2957640	2959300	Facebook games.
2959300	2963400	That even then, if they were to disappear and delete tomorrow, I wouldn't lose any sleep
2963400	2964400	over it.
2964400	2968240	Well, you keep in mind, too, that a lot of, like, remember when I was playing Ragnarok
2968240	2969240	Online?
2969240	2972640	A lot of the free servers that I would play on, they would actually make the money to
2972640	2978840	run the servers by offering special items for people who donated.
2978840	2983120	And that's been going on for years.
2983120	2984960	Second Life, that's how they run.
2984960	2990480	You know, you pay real money for stuff that people have made, and that's how you do your
2990480	2992080	thing there.
2992080	2997120	I think that it's just now they're saying that, you know, when you don't notice how
2997120	3003400	much you're spending, that it's easier to spend a lot more, if that makes sense.
3003400	3004400	Absolutely.
3004400	3007000	That's gambling, is a lot of that.
3007000	3010280	And on top of that, you're not dealing with actual physical money.
3010280	3013560	You're dealing with a click, yes.
3013560	3018440	There's no money leaving your hand, but it's relieving your bank account, so.
3018440	3019440	It could be dangerous.
3019440	3022440	When Xbox Live first came out, I bought every single arcade game that came out.
3022440	3023440	Freakin' iTunes.
3023440	3026240	Yeah, iTunes is easy to fall into that too.
3026240	3027240	Same thing.
3027240	3028240	Oh yeah.
3028240	3030240	So, anyway.
3030240	3031920	Good talks tonight!
3031920	3032920	Speaking of Xbox Live-
3032920	3035400	Keep a ledger by your desk when you play.
3035400	3036400	For real.
3036400	3039360	Alright, Loki, what's up next in the news for us?
3039360	3040360	Alright.
3040360	3041360	Oops.
3041360	3042360	Anyways.
3042360	3048520	This is kinda cool, they're doing a new promotion, it's kinda something that they've been doing
3048520	3051120	each year for Xbox Live Arcade.
3051120	3052120	The House Party.
3052120	3056880	Well, this time they've got a lineup of games coming out that's actually pretty cool.
3056880	3062320	There's gonna be five games that will start coming out on February 18th, each week.
3062320	3064600	And it's gonna include the following titles.
3064600	3072960	Beyond Good and Evil HD, Hardcore Uprising, that's that Contra game that's kinda anime
3072960	3073960	style now.
3073960	3080480	Bejeweled Blitz Live, Full House Poker, which is supposed to be that game that's kind of
3080480	3086920	the next evolution of the, what do they call that, the 1 vs 100 type thing, but now with
3086920	3087920	poker.
3087920	3091680	And then of course, Torchlight is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade as well.
3091680	3096600	So that's a pretty good lineup of titles right there.
3096600	3105880	And no word on pricing for that yet, but those are gonna be each week, so that's pretty exciting.
3105880	3110520	I am so excited about Torchlight coming.
3110520	3111520	It's gonna be sweet.
3111520	3116480	But it's gonna be weird, because Torchlight is very PC.
3116480	3117480	You know what I mean?
3117480	3122040	And if you've never played it, it's basically Diablo 2.
3122040	3124020	I don't know how else to explain it.
3124020	3129840	It's a lot of that same kind of like dungeon crawl, and lots of keys do different things.
3129840	3133040	And I think they've talked about with this coming to Xbox Live Arcade, they've practically
3133040	3137720	revamped the whole battle system, because you kinda have to click a lot.
3137720	3140240	You have to use a mouse to play Torchlight.
3140240	3144480	So going from that to controller is gonna be really weird.
3144480	3146840	It's not even gonna be the same game.
3146840	3150600	So it's almost strange to me that they're calling it Torchlight still.
3150600	3154240	It's almost like Torchlight Side Quest or Side Story.
3154240	3158500	I guess I don't really know until I get my hands on it how different it's gonna be, but
3158500	3164920	just at the base with changing all these controls is gonna be really interesting.
3164920	3168880	But at the same time, they're gonna kinda trick me into buying the same game twice,
3168880	3171600	because I have it on PC and now I kinda want it on Xbox Live Arcade.
3171600	3172600	Damn it!
3172600	3173600	Damn it!
3173600	3174600	Exactly.
3174600	3175600	I've been tricked into buying this game twice.
3175600	3177160	What about you, chatters?
3177160	3181240	Many of you guys play Torchlight on your PC, and yet you think you're gonna buy this on
3181240	3184000	Xbox Live Arcade as well?
3184000	3185000	So I'm curious about...
3185000	3188600	What were some of the other games that were coming out?
3188600	3190640	It's all Torchlight Torchlight to me.
3190640	3194680	But Joel Blitz Live, they have that...
3194680	3196280	That game's free to play on Facebook.
3196280	3198480	They're gonna charge me to play it on Xbox Live?
3198480	3199480	Yeah.
3199480	3200480	Bastards.
3200480	3201480	Beyond Good and Evil HD.
3201480	3204000	I know a lot of people are Beyond Good and Evil fans.
3204000	3206000	Yeah, that'll be a big one.
3206000	3207320	What else?
3207320	3210520	Oh, there's that new poker game that was from Microsoft.
3210520	3215360	Oh, that's the 1 versus 100 replacement, isn't it?
3215360	3216360	Yes.
3216360	3219200	Bochikawa in our chatroom says Torchlight with Kinect support?
3219200	3220680	That might be really fun.
3220680	3222840	I don't think it uses Kinect.
3222840	3223840	I don't think so either.
3223840	3226360	That's an interesting thought, though, is that what if instead of a mouse, it was your
3226360	3227360	hand?
3227360	3231780	And you could just move your hand around and click by, like, just thrusting your hand forward
3231780	3232780	or something?
3232780	3233780	I don't know.
3233780	3234780	It'd be interesting.
3234780	3237720	Did Suya remind us that Diablo was on the PlayStation?
3237720	3238960	Look at how Diablo worked on the PlayStation.
3238960	3241160	They just changed the controls to work with the controller.
3241160	3244480	I totally forgot that Diablo had been on the PlayStation.
3244480	3247000	I think I did play it on the PlayStation, too.
3247000	3248000	All right.
3248000	3251440	Well, anyhow, moving on to another story while some more comments come in.
3251440	3252440	This is one of those stories.
3252440	3256160	I just want to hurry up and get through this and forget about it because it's another one
3256160	3261880	of these, like, crazy obscure patent guy comes out and decides to sue reputable companies
3261880	3265760	in a court of law because everybody in this country is too happy.
3265760	3268160	And who's getting sued this time?
3268160	3272880	Activision Blizzard and Zynga.
3272880	3276900	And I can't, like, what do these two companies possibly have in common where they're both
3276900	3277900	being sued?
3277900	3284480	Well, Walker Digital, which was founded by Jay Walker, who also made Priceline.com, is
3284480	3285480	behind this suit.
3285480	3287060	So maybe it's not just any old troll.
3287060	3289720	This is a troll with a big website.
3289720	3296800	Zynga and Activision violate the patent, which is a database-driven online distributed
3296800	3299920	tournament system.
3299920	3306000	Walker is saying that the part of this that has been violated is the part of the patent
3306000	3311200	that says there is a, quote, method of conducting a distributed electronic tournament for a
3311200	3314160	plurality of players.
3314160	3319640	And World of Warcraft Call of Duty Black Ops, which is Activision, which is part of Blizzard
3319640	3325680	Card, Mafia Wars, and all these games have these tournaments in them.
3325680	3328760	Kind of odd that Starcraft isn't mentioned, because when I think tournaments, I don't
3328760	3332360	think, wow, I think Starcraft, but whatever.
3332360	3334600	I guess violates this patent.
3334600	3339880	I don't know, I'm starting to think with all these stories I read that patent stuff is
3339880	3341480	a need for reform, or-
3341480	3344280	I think whatever judge reviews that needs to just tell him to bite his ass.
3344280	3347520	Well, and it probably will get laughed out of court, as a lot of these recent ones have,
3347520	3349800	but they're asking for a full trial or whatever.
3349800	3350800	And you know what?
3350800	3353760	If this guy had the technology years ago or whatever, that's fine.
3353760	3357440	If you were the one that thought of it, I guess, although I somehow don't think these
3357440	3360440	companies have implemented it quite the same way.
3360440	3364600	And just the fact that, why do you patent something and then do nothing with it?
3364600	3367120	Like that's what bothers.
3367120	3370240	That's what makes you look like a troll, is you're just waiting for someone to actually
3370240	3374680	put a good idea to use, and then it gets to the pants off of them.
3374680	3375680	I don't know.
3375680	3380640	A little silly to me, and I'm sure it's a little silly to all of you as well.
3380640	3383440	Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?
3383440	3386440	Oh, I've got a few other things.
3386440	3388440	How about Mario All-Stars?
3388440	3395120	Well, it's sold out, and copies are going for 80 bucks on eBay, and they're talking
3395120	3397120	about more reprints.
3397120	3401220	So we might be seeing it going, however, they have not sold out in the UK.
3401220	3407440	And you can still get your copy on Amazon UK for $17.99.
3407440	3410960	So people in Europe, stockpile!
3410960	3412800	Because we're coming after your supply.
3412800	3416760	And people here in the US, you're gonna be really sorry buying these for $80 on eBay
3416760	3418920	if they end up reprinting them, which they probably will.
3418920	3428200	Well yeah, I mean, basically, Mark Franklin, who's the head of Nintendo PR, said that they're
3428200	3432960	thinking about bringing it back in reprints.
3432960	3436040	So they definitely want to make more money, and people will buy them.
3436040	3437900	The market's there.
3437900	3442120	And I'm sure there's gotta be a lot of us sitting here going, who is buying this?
3442120	3447440	Because seriously, it's a port of a game that was out on the SNES, I mean.
3447440	3452520	Well here's this, Dan turned to me a while back and said, hey, you want this game?
3452520	3453520	Why?
3453520	3454520	We've got it on the SNES.
3454520	3458680	I mean, I think we were talking about wanting the special edition or something because it
3458680	3461360	came with shit, but why?
3461360	3463120	I'll tell you who's buying this.
3463120	3466120	Most people out there in the world aren't like you and Dan.
3466120	3471220	There's a lot of folks that, you know, are having families now that when they were teenagers
3471220	3474860	were playing the Super Nintendo and remember this game on the Super Nintendo.
3474860	3476080	It's soccer moms!
3476080	3479660	It's the same people that are driving the sales of the Wii in the first place.
3479660	3482280	Soccer moms are buying the Mario games because they remember playing it when they were younger.
3482280	3487160	I guarantee that you can buy a Super Nintendo and the game for less than $80.
3487160	3491360	Oh no, I'm sure you can.
3491360	3493000	The game is easy to find.
3493000	3498440	I mean, it wasn't like a super limited production or anything, but you can find them.
3498440	3500160	Most people don't understand that.
3500160	3501160	I think I've got two copies.
3501160	3502160	They think it's the Wii.
3502160	3504120	If I have another copy I'll send it to somebody.
3504120	3508960	I know this is hard for people that listen to this show to understand because you all
3508960	3512680	are very gaming aware, you're culturally aware of the gaming community.
3512680	3516780	I think there's a lot of people out there that honestly don't understand that.
3516780	3520640	They don't think you can buy Super Nintendos anymore or they think that, well, it's on
3520640	3521640	the Wii.
3521640	3522640	It's a Wii version.
3522640	3523640	It's different.
3523640	3526200	No, it's not.
3526200	3528280	They don't know that.
3528280	3530380	All they know is that the game is on the Wii now.
3530380	3533200	We are expert analysts of video games.
3533200	3534560	Trust us.
3534560	3535560	It's the same thing.
3535560	3540040	It's like when they re-release The Wizard of Oz into theaters for a limited run.
3540040	3543480	It's the same damn movie.
3543480	3545080	They didn't put anything back.
3545080	3548000	Dorothy suddenly does not go home.
3548000	3549000	You know what I mean?
3549000	3550000	She still clicks her heels three times.
3550000	3551000	That'd be fucking hilarious.
3551000	3553000	They changed the ending.
3553000	3555000	But no, the movie is still the same.
3555000	3556000	You know what I mean?
3556000	3557000	Nothing's changed.
3557000	3558720	But a lot of people don't get that.
3558720	3559720	I honestly truly think-
3559720	3562940	It changed the ending and she's actually in the Insane Asylum like in the second movie.
3562940	3566200	I honestly truly think people don't know that you can go out and still buy the game.
3566200	3570640	They think that, oh, they've re-released this now and I can get it on my Wii for my kids.
3570640	3573320	They should be listening to our podcast.
3573320	3575040	Why aren't they?
3575040	3577040	And some folks in the chat room seem to agree with me.
3577040	3578520	Tiger Claw says true.
3578520	3581540	And people who never bought a Mario game in their life, this will be their first entry
3581540	3582540	to Mario.
3582540	3586100	DDR Dollar Bill says, here's the thing, casual players aren't going to go out and find a
3586100	3588820	Super Nintendo and then find the games.
3588820	3590440	They don't know how to hunt at a free market.
3590440	3591440	Lazy.
3591440	3592440	I know.
3592440	3596960	They're taking advantage of lazy people.
3596960	3601200	Every industry out there takes advantage of people being lazy.
3601200	3604240	We have certain infomercials exist.
3604240	3609040	They create problems for people that people didn't have before so that they can sell them
3609040	3611760	a product for something, for a problem they didn't have.
3611760	3614800	Thank you for reminding me because I actually have a problem with my cat not being able
3614800	3620220	to get high enough on our windows so I had to go buy a Sunny Seat for it.
3620220	3621220	Your cat can live.
3621220	3622340	It's a cat.
3622340	3624360	She needs to be higher up on the window.
3624360	3626320	Shirmi sits on the damn floor.
3626320	3627320	Cats desire height.
3627320	3630320	When she wants sunlight, she goes and sits in front of the door.
3630320	3635240	I think some of the greatest company ideas out there are formed on how can I allow people
3635240	3636240	to be more lazy.
3636240	3637680	Like, let me give you an example.
3637680	3642000	There's companies out there that will do takeout for any type of food and they just charge
3642000	3643000	like a surcharge over it.
3643000	3644440	We have something called takeout taxi.
3644440	3647120	Yeah, any restaurant in the world can get you takeout food.
3647120	3648680	Now here's the thing.
3648680	3654400	Not everybody who uses that is lazy because certainly you have homebound people, sick
3654400	3656800	people, people who don't have driver's license.
3656800	3658800	People who are studying for their finals.
3658800	3659800	Yeah, exactly.
3659800	3663160	But I'll bet you that's 10% of who's using it.
3663160	3664160	Oh yeah.
3664160	3667000	No, I understand.
3667000	3671200	It's just, you know, what, I don't want to start ranting again.
3671200	3672200	Forget it.
3672200	3673200	No.
3673200	3674200	Please rant.
3674200	3675200	We haven't had good rants in a long time on this show.
3675200	3681800	Why can't people just get off their asses and just put effort into shit, you know?
3681800	3686440	Because then I have to look away from my farm and my plants on my Farmville will die.
3686440	3690080	I was just ranting, Rob.
3690080	3696240	It's like, nothing is going to equal the experience of sitting down and playing the game on the
3696240	3699280	Super Nintendo with the right controller.
3699280	3702320	It's just not going to be the same.
3702320	3705880	And I mean, like, you know, that's the whole reason why we didn't get the new Donkey Kong,
3705880	3706880	Rob?
3706880	3709480	It's because you can't play it with a classic controller.
3709480	3710680	It's not Donkey Kong.
3710680	3711920	Oh wow.
3711920	3714060	You have to do the little shaky thing.
3714060	3715640	They didn't want to put motion control in it.
3715640	3718520	Miyamoto made them.
3718520	3720240	That's retarded.
3720240	3724240	I want to sit down and play a game that doesn't have motion control and I want to wear my
3724240	3730040	pajamas while I'm doing it so I can be lazy playing it the way it's meant to be played.
3730040	3732140	So I'll go to effort to be lazy.
3732140	3736440	You know what's a really interesting comment here from XLink in our chat room?
3736440	3738620	Netflix is another company.
3738620	3742320	And I'm not, he didn't really put context to that so I'm assuming it means, like, Netflix
3742320	3745140	kind of made their money off lazy things.
3745140	3749760	But I don't know, like, I can definitely see that end of it but I don't know if I'd necessarily
3749760	3753600	call it lazy as much as it is damn convenient.
3753600	3756480	You know, because what did we have to do before?
3756480	3760080	You had to get out, get in your car, go to the video store and so forth.
3760080	3763160	It's just, it's more convenience in my opinion.
3763160	3765680	It's also kind of the subscriber fee.
3765680	3770320	You know, when Blockbuster had their stores, not until the end after Netflix was out did
3770320	3773920	they have these monthly fees where you could rent all the movies you wanted.
3773920	3777800	Like I always, like that's why people like Netflix from what I understood was that, you
3777800	3780680	know, they could send one movie away and there'd be another one waiting for them and it's kind
3780680	3785120	of like, you know, I don't, I can kind of take that going to Blockbuster out of my daily
3785120	3787040	routine and watch more movies.
3787040	3790360	I don't know if I would call that lazy though.
3790360	3792280	I mean, I guess it is in a way.
3792280	3797040	Yeah, it's, people are convenience centric.
3797040	3804320	They're focused on convenience and, you know, I kind of miss, you know, going to Blockbuster
3804320	3808120	and looking at the movies and reading the backs of them and everything and going to
3808120	3812480	rent my games and the special rental only versions of stuff.
3812480	3817280	Well there's still like one Blockbuster in every town if you want to do that.
3817280	3819440	It's just farther away now.
3819440	3820840	And the fucking red box thing.
3820840	3823840	I hate the red box.
3823840	3828080	That's why my husband doesn't have a job as a freaking red box.
3828080	3829080	Hate it.
3829080	3831880	I'm not really a big fan of red box either.
3831880	3837160	Like in my opinion, you should go out to the, like you should go out to a Blockbuster if
3837160	3838360	you're going to use something like red box.
3838360	3839720	It's not that different.
3839720	3843240	And this is what the other problem is too is that I think that there's a sort of forced
3843240	3846040	isolation going on people.
3846040	3851040	You know, it used to be you had to get out and be in society and be a part of things,
3851040	3857280	but now it's like everyone's an individual and we have to cater to everybody and political
3857280	3859120	correct and blah, blah, blah.
3859120	3864600	And I think that it's a matter of you're removing the human element from the equation.
3864600	3867080	Ooh, good point from Frisbee in our chat room.
3867080	3869040	Netflix eliminated the late fees.
3869040	3870480	That's why it got so popular.
3870480	3871480	That's a very good point.
3871480	3873800	But, but do you see what I do?
3873800	3874800	I do.
3874800	3875800	I do.
3875800	3877840	I have to make sure our chatters, every gamer has a voice.
3877840	3883720	For example, even with world of Warcraft, going back to that, you're, you're not really
3883720	3889380	there hanging out with your people, you know, you're chatting and yeah, but it's impersonal.
3889380	3891440	It's pretty impersonal I think.
3891440	3894560	And what happened to getting people together and playing a board game or getting people
3894560	3898280	over for, you know, doing four player bomber man?
3898280	3902320	See, I like to do both, but sometimes it's not practical.
3902320	3903320	You know what I mean?
3903320	3905540	Like sometimes I'm playing these games with people that live halfway across the country
3905540	3906640	or all the way across the country.
3906640	3907640	That's fine.
3907640	3908640	That's one thing.
3908640	3912080	But I'm saying how many people in the guild live in town or near town?
3912080	3917720	I mean that, that's, you know, one point you, it used to be that we would, all of us would
3917720	3921520	get together like twice a week and play DDR or go to the arcade and something and now
3921520	3923720	it's just like, Oh, I'll see you online.
3923720	3924720	What happened to hanging out?
3924720	3928480	What happened to good old fashioned hanging out?
3928480	3932280	It's I think that the other thing with, with, you know, all of this is just that it's removing
3932280	3934560	the personal element from everything.
3934560	3938440	We are a convenience driven society and we also don't like dealing with people because
3938440	3943400	it's inconvenient to, anyway, more ranting.
3943400	3948600	Yet, yet there's a stigma in our society that we all need to be skinny and beautiful because
3948600	3950640	only skinny is beautiful.
3950640	3957440	But the realistic end of it is that with how much we are lazy and convenience driven, it
3957440	3964800	ought to be that like, you know, sitting at home all day getting really, really, you know,
3964800	3967840	nonactive and stuff ought to be the pretty thing, right?
3967840	3970400	Cause that's where more people are at these days.
3970400	3971400	I don't know.
3971400	3974280	So what you're saying is like back in the middle ages.
3974280	3975280	Sure.
3975280	3983760	Cause if you know, you were fair skinned and stuff and nonworking, then you were more desirable.
3983760	3985960	I would be so famous in the middle ages.
3985960	3987240	All right.
3987240	3989080	We're totally getting on this like off topic.
3989080	3991360	Remember when big butts were in?
3991360	3994120	You have that magnet.
3994120	3996280	I like big butts and I cannot lie.
3996280	3997280	You either brothers can't deny.
3997280	3998280	I thought you liked boobs.
3998280	3999520	All right, let's move on.
3999520	4000520	Release dates.
4000520	4003880	Let's travel around the world and see what is conveniently coming out to a store near
4003880	4004880	you.
4004880	4005880	Yes.
4005880	4010160	Not a whole lot this week yet, but there are a few things coming out, so that's good.
4010160	4019040	The start of things off, Venetica, which is on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
4019040	4022400	Ghost Trick Phantom Detective on Nintendo DS.
4022400	4027000	That's by the artwork from the guys that did stuff on the Ace Attorney series.
4027000	4028760	So that looks pretty cool.
4028760	4031320	DC Universe.
4031320	4035360	They're going to have that available on PlayStation 3 and PC, both the regular and collector's
4035360	4037680	editions of those.
4037680	4042280	Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude, on PSP.
4042280	4044280	What?
4044280	4045600	Say that again.
4045600	4050800	Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.
4050800	4055120	Prinny's are the little guys in the Disgaea, little penguin dudes, right?
4055120	4056120	Yes.
4056120	4057760	And this is about Operation Panties?
4057760	4058760	Yes.
4058760	4061640	Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.
4061640	4066440	Okay, like, what the fuck happened to this series when I wasn't watching it?
4066440	4070760	So, like, now there's a game coming out where the little penguins are going on a panty raid.
4070760	4072280	Am I correct?
4072280	4073960	I'm not sure.
4073960	4075720	What is Operation Panties?
4075720	4077280	I have no idea.
4077280	4080200	Alright, keep going.
4080200	4081880	I need to do some research.
4081880	4083560	Kingdom Hearts Re-Coded.
4083560	4086760	That's coming out on Nintendo DS this week.
4086760	4094320	Um, Spell Force 2, Faith and Destiny on PC.
4094320	4101280	Um, let's see.
4101280	4103640	And that's basically it.
4103640	4105640	Next week, lots of good stuff.
4105640	4109480	But that's for next week's, or the week after next, I should say.
4109480	4112240	I want me some Little Big Planet 2.
4112240	4116200	There's no wiki entry on Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.
4116200	4119480	I'm trying to find more information on this.
4119480	4120480	I'm doing Google.
4120480	4121920	Give me a minute.
4121920	4122920	Let's see.
4122920	4125080	Okay, there's something on the PlayStation blog.
4125080	4127880	Let's see what this is all about.
4127880	4132680	Prinny 2 is a side-scrolling hack and slash action game and you can play as Prinny.
4132680	4137080	Your mission this time is to find the precious panties of demon lord Etna.
4137080	4142440	Yes, you have to search for Etna's panties, or Etna swears that she will skin all Prinny's
4142440	4145240	and make them into panties.
4145240	4149800	Well now that I think of that, Prinny panties would be kind of cool, but not for the Prinny's.
4149800	4155040	You must find her panties by following morning in the game so you don't have any time to
4155040	4156040	dilly dally.
4156040	4161320	Let's get to it, dude.
4161320	4162880	Words escape me, folks.
4162880	4165760	This is what gaming has become.
4165760	4166760	Look at your life.
4166760	4168760	Look at your choices.
4168760	4173880	What, what, what are you doing?
4173880	4179960	Insolacious pop is, is chiming in there.
4179960	4182120	Etna, the demon girl was in Disgaea.
4182120	4186240	Her panties are missing and you fight an action platformer to find them, but with panties
4186240	4192160	like in ghosts and goblins, those ghosts and goblins and panties.
4192160	4197040	I just, I can't.
4197040	4201600	Although you know what, this game probably deserves to sell more copies than a lot of
4201600	4202600	the stuff out there.
4202600	4205720	I mean, hooray for them for giving gamers what they really want.
4205720	4206720	Panties.
4206720	4211440	Let's move on to Japan and talk about some of the crazy games coming out over there.
4211440	4215400	On the Xbox 360, Arcana Heart 3 is making its way out this week.
4215400	4218040	Arcana Heart, that's the all chick fighters, right?
4218040	4219040	Yeah.
4219040	4221740	Alright, number 3 is coming out.
4221740	4223040	Panties will fly.
4223040	4226340	Or at least they will in my brain.
4226340	4231440	James Bond Bloodstone comes out on 360 this week as well as Mass Effect 2, the Japanese
4231440	4232440	edition.
4232440	4234600	It took them a little while to localize it for those guys.
4234600	4239000	Stoked, big air edition also on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
4239000	4246720	And a very limited edition Arcana Heart 3 arcade stick coming out as well.
4246720	4253820	Coming out on the Playstation 3, Arcana Heart 3 gets a version there as well and a joystick
4253820	4258660	and James Bond Bloodstone also coming out on the Playstation 3 in Japan.
4258660	4260600	So the releases kind of mirror each other there.
4260600	4265880	Nothing on the Wii this week, in fact things are kind of quiet from Nintendo until we get
4265880	4268160	to the last story in a couple weeks.
4268160	4271400	And then of course Nintendo is going to be all about the 3DS in Japan in just a little
4271400	4272400	bit.
4272400	4275080	So things are going to be quiet there for a little bit, but we'll get back to them in
4275080	4276080	a while.
4276080	4280600	The DS, also very quiet unless you want to get Zombie Daisuke, oh wait that's actually
4280600	4281600	next week.
4281600	4284000	So there's nothing on the DS this week.
4284000	4286640	But how about the PSP, there's a few games coming out there.
4286640	4293080	Macross Ultimate Frontier gets a price reduction this week as does Umiwaza Yikari no Yasashi
4293080	4295040	Igo gets a price reduction.
4295040	4298720	It's not coming out, it's getting a little cheaper and more affordable.
4298720	4306720	And this game is, it's like that old game Go, but like with one of the world's experts
4306720	4314440	who's this kind of cute chick in her cyber form helping you to play that old game.
4314440	4316720	Does she strip Go naked if I do well?
4316720	4317720	It's not strip Go.
4317720	4319160	Get your mind out of the gutter.
4319160	4320760	Not interested.
4320760	4326880	Also Black Robina comes out this week from one of my favorite named companies over there,
4326880	4327880	Broccoli.
4327880	4330280	You know what else Broccoli did?
4330280	4331280	What else?
4331280	4332280	Digi-Carrot.
4332280	4333280	Ah.
4333280	4335880	Well they're doing Black Robina on the PSP this week.
4335880	4338240	That's it for Japanese releases.
4338240	4340880	Well for Europe there's a few.
4340880	4345260	We have Zite on Xbox 360 for the 12th.
4345260	4349120	On the 14th is DC Universe Online and Ghost Trick.
4349120	4351760	And also Kingdom Hearts Recoded.
4351760	4354760	And that's it.
4354760	4357940	Alright we're almost to the Classic Game of the Week, but first a couple more stories
4357940	4359360	for you guys.
4359360	4363360	And this next story, you're going to want to remember this when we get into Part B tonight.
4363360	4364360	Yes.
4364360	4371360	HQ has partnered with Mattel and they're going to be doing some brand new license games based
4371360	4373480	on their properties.
4373480	4380560	And of course some of the deals that they have in place already, well they've already
4380560	4383920	got some stuff I guess.
4383920	4388800	He-Man by the power of Greyskull.
4388800	4390180	So that's kind of cool.
4390180	4395300	And then they haven't really said what other rights they're also going to be working with
4395300	4396300	I guess.
4396300	4401120	Ah let's see here, they said Barbie Hot Wheels.
4401120	4405080	It's kind of odd because Barbie and Hot Wheels right now, Activision kind of has the rights
4405080	4408200	to those because they've been making games for them for a while now.
4408200	4412000	Mainly the Barbie stuff off of the DVD movies.
4412000	4416000	If you believe it or not they keep releasing DVD movies for Barbie stuff.
4416000	4426920	Fisher Price, Rock'em Sock'em Robots, Masters of the Universe, and Polly Pocket.
4426920	4431920	And of course you know people are wondering, also they're going to be maybe doing some
4431920	4438640	tie-ins with the U-Draw game tablet because they do have that by the way.
4438640	4443440	So I don't know, it's interesting.
4443440	4447720	I wonder if they're going to be doing any off of the new Masters of the Universe series.
4447720	4450800	Is that even still around?
4450800	4451800	Do they show it in reruns?
4451800	4452800	I don't know.
4452800	4456080	Weren't they supposed to be optioning a new movie or something for that?
4456080	4459320	Well Dolph Lundgren needs more work.
4459320	4462360	I'm serious man, the guy- Isn't he like senile by now?
4462360	4464040	He's got to be getting pretty old.
4464040	4466760	He was in Expendables, he's not that old.
4466760	4471000	Well Expendables was different though, it brought back everybody for that movie.
4471000	4472360	They're all pretty old.
4472360	4476160	Alright, one more story for you guys, then the classic game of the week.
4476160	4479240	And this has to do with some big announcements, the Consumer Electronics Show this week, which
4479240	4483900	usually isn't a gaming show per se, but a few things will always get slipped in there
4483900	4488360	because of course gaming consoles are what's in your living room.
4488360	4492840	And one place that gaming consoles have really expanded beyond just the place you play video
4492840	4498100	games is being an entertainment device, letting you watch movies and Netflix on them.
4498100	4501480	And Microsoft talked a little bit about Netflix expansion.
4501480	4506000	Coming this spring, Netflix will get Kinect enabled.
4506000	4510560	So you'll be able to flail your arms to queue up episodes of Veronica Mars if that's how
4510560	4511560	you choose to do it.
4511560	4514600	I bet this will be one of those things where you use it a couple times to impress your
4514600	4516480	friends and then you're done with it.
4516480	4521960	Because you know, as cool as the Kinect technology is, I don't know, it'd be a little slow to
4521960	4525640	like wave your arms and then kind of look for the movie you're looking for.
4525640	4529880	Now where this might be really cool is that instead of fumbling for the controller, which
4529880	4536200	is probably off, if you're able to say, Kinect, pause, so you can go up and get a sandwich,
4536200	4537200	that will be great.
4537200	4538600	That will be the coolest thing about Xbox Netflix.
4538600	4541320	Kinect, make me a sandwich.
4541320	4543540	Maybe next year's CES, who knows.
4543540	4546840	Also announced though is that Hulu will be coming to Xbox.
4546840	4551140	It's out on the PlayStation, but Hulu Plus will be coming to the Xbox 360 at the same
4551140	4553320	time later this spring.
4553320	4554820	So there you go.
4554820	4559060	One other little tidbit that was dropped in the press conference, remember how Microsoft
4559060	4563320	had a goal of selling 5 million Kinect units by Christmas?
4563320	4567720	Well they came out at CES and said they sold 8 million units.
4567720	4572080	But some people have said, wait a minute, did you really sell 8 million units?
4572080	4576360	Or did you push 8 million units out there to retailers?
4576360	4577640	Hmm.
4577640	4581760	Well regardless of however the numbers are being skewed, it still is a fairly impressive
4581760	4582760	amount.
4582760	4586700	I guarantee if they, I think those are sold numbers because they haven't been sitting
4586700	4587700	on shelves.
4587700	4588700	Let me put it that way.
4588700	4590880	They're hard to find.
4590880	4593880	So yeah, and who knew?
4593880	4598000	A lot of people thought that that was going to be a high number for them to break because
4598000	4601480	that's way more than they sold 360s in the first year.
4601480	4605440	Of course 360s were really hard to get at that time, so I don't know.
4605440	4606840	These are still hard to get.
4606840	4608640	Are they really?
4608640	4609640	I guess I'm spoiled by what you have to say.
4609640	4611600	It seems that way at least.
4611600	4613080	Probably not for retailers.
4613080	4616840	It's pretty easy to get for them.
4616840	4622280	I like how everybody in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrady.com is coming out with their own ideas for what
4622280	4624240	Connect should do on voice command.
4624240	4628760	Like DDR Dollar Bill says, Connect, get me a beer.
4628760	4634000	Frisbee in our chatroom says, Computer, end holodeck.
4634000	4640040	DDR Dollar Bill says, Connect, ban this douchebag who called me a racial slur.
4640040	4644000	Someday, someday.
4644000	4649280	Tiger Claw, Xbox, play Tron, Tron, Tron, I said Tron, damn it.
4649280	4652440	Yeah, it would be like the voice recognition on the DS.
4652440	4658920	Blue, blue, brew.
4658920	4661320	That joke will make sense if you've ever played Brain Age.
4661320	4664880	Alright, let's move on to the classic game of the week.
4664880	4665880	Yay.
4665880	4671480	It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane to gaming's past where Dark Soccer is
4671480	4675740	going to step into the vault and pull a game out of the archives and she thinks, hey, you
4675740	4683000	ungrateful kids, you should put down all those newfangled holiday toys and your 3DSs and
4683000	4687920	play games the way we used to where we had to walk barefoot through the snow both ways,
4687920	4694800	20 miles up the river and eat our grape nuts to play these games.
4694800	4695800	I'm still hungry, Rob.
4695800	4697400	All I've had is pizza.
4697400	4700520	Alright, what is the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer?
4700520	4706020	Space Fury, specifically Space Fury on the ColecoVision.
4706020	4708560	You have to play a little bit of, you have to play the opening taunt.
4708560	4710120	I love that music.
4710120	4711120	Okay.
4711120	4725640	So this is the screen where you select your difficulty.
4725640	4727800	Suddenly I'm watching a Space Odyssey.
4727800	4731160	That was something that we heard a lot of in my house when I was in the third grade.
4731160	4732160	I love this game.
4732160	4733160	Isn't it great?
4733160	4734160	Okay.
4734160	4739000	Now, before I go into the ColecoVision version, which is what this is, I'm going to have to
4739000	4741000	go into the arcade version.
4741000	4745160	It was put out by Sega on June 17th, 1981.
4745160	4749960	It has a rotate left, rotate right and thrust and fire.
4749960	4754880	So basically it's kind of, it kind of plays like asteroids, but you, as you go through
4754880	4758840	the game, you actually can get like a little armored unit that takes you to different levels
4758840	4763920	of different things you can shoot, except that these little segments combine into a
4763920	4764920	bigger segment.
4764920	4769360	And then you have to, you know, blow up the smaller segments and stuff, but they can blow
4769360	4770360	you up.
4770360	4773560	It looks like a little bit time pilot, which kind of was asteroids inspired too.
4773560	4776400	It's kind of like between the two.
4776400	4779100	As far as the arcade, the arcade version was vector.
4779100	4785160	So of course this one's not vector, but the, uh, the arcade version, it was vector on an
4785160	4790040	XY monitor and it ran on the Sega G80 arcade system.
4790040	4796960	Had some of the best lines in it, like, so a creature for my amusement, prepare for battle.
4796960	4801040	And my favorite one is, and I keep in mind, my mother was great at this game.
4801040	4803400	She played a lot of freaking space fury.
4803400	4809200	Um, but like when you, uh, win the game, basically the last thing that you get is, our battle
4809200	4810360	is concluded, warrior.
4810360	4813960	You were a stimulating opponent.
4813960	4819160	And the alien in this also appears in a video game called Zektor.
4819160	4824320	Now for the Colecovision version, of course it's sprite based.
4824320	4829160	It's, you know, really, really early video game system.
4829160	4830840	I don't know what else I can say about that.
4830840	4836360	Um, but you use the little, uh, uh, cause it had the keypad controller, so you'd actually,
4836360	4843320	uh, thrust and go with your little side shoulders and fire that the same way and, uh, move around.
4843320	4845240	It was actually kind of hard to control.
4845240	4851120	I was not good at this game, but like I said, a lot of this game happened in my house.
4851120	4858440	And you can get, you know, power ups for shooting and, you know, get extra, uh, bullets and
4858440	4859440	everything.
4859440	4862320	So it was really cool, but, it's simple.
4862320	4865240	You blow shit up, the game.
4865240	4869760	I love this game and I played it on the Colecovision actually, it was one of the games that I really
4869760	4870760	enjoyed playing.
4870760	4872560	I never had a Colecovision growing up.
4872560	4873560	Well...
4873560	4875200	I've got two, you wanna borrow one?
4875200	4876680	I'm not growing up anymore.
4876680	4880000	Oh come on, Rob, we know you're still growing up.
4880000	4883440	I am.
4883440	4886520	This is when it talked to you.
4886520	4891080	The voice is so realistic.
4891080	4895120	That's even better than Impossible Mission.
4895120	4899480	Another visitor, stay awhile, stay forever.
4899480	4900960	So that's Space Fury.
4900960	4906220	Alright, your classic game of the week this week is Space Fury.
4906220	4907440	Good pick.
4907440	4911520	Even if it's not one I'm super familiar with, it looked very interesting, so I will have
4911520	4912520	to check it out.
4912520	4913840	I think I've already done Gorf, haven't I?
4913840	4914840	I'm sure you have.
4914840	4915840	I'm sure you have.
4915840	4917600	Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, guys, but don't go anywhere.
4917600	4921080	We're gonna be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio in Part B tonight.
4921080	4927640	We're gonna do some quick, quick news, including some news on what's going on with APB, Bionic
4927640	4931040	Commander Rearmed 2, we got some news on, and we're gonna get some other news stories
4931040	4936960	tonight about the Mac App Store, of course, your Twitter topics, the mailbag, and, because
4936960	4940520	Dark Sakura specifically asked for it before the show started tonight, we're gonna do a
4940520	4941520	list list tonight.
4941520	4944720	I hope you were paying attention in Part A, because it has to do with what our list list
4944720	4945720	is about.
4945720	4955560	We'll tell you all about that when we come right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
4955560	4959600	And welcome back, everybody, to Part B of tonight's Orange Launch Radio.
4959600	4967640	It is episode number 396 for this January the 9th of 2011.
4967640	4970640	And I know we can't play the music on the break when you guys listen to this on the
4970640	4975320	podcast, but we had some music from Tron in there, just because Loki was talking about
4975320	4980080	how he wanted to go see that just one more time before it leaves the whole D-Box thing.
4980080	4984240	And I'm kind of in the same boat, except the place I need to see it is IMAX, and even though
4984240	4988920	I hear it's actually not as great on IMAX as it is in 3D, at least that was a consensus
4988920	4993000	on my Facebook post earlier this week, I still just feel like I need to see it, so I see
4993000	4994960	it once in every format.
4994960	4996800	But I guess the Blu-ray's coming out soon.
4996800	5000640	Well, not soon, but, you know, it will come out and that will be a must-have.
5000640	5004880	But Blu-rays that came out recently that I need to see, I still have not seen this movie,
5004880	5005880	can you believe it?
5005880	5006880	Inception?
5006880	5008400	I still haven't seen it, and I need to.
5008400	5009400	You do need to see that.
5009400	5010400	That is pretty awesome.
5010400	5011400	I hear it.
5011400	5014120	I've heard nothing but great things about that movie, and now that the Blu-ray's out,
5014120	5015640	I'm gonna need to see that, so.
5015640	5018880	It is absolutely something you should see.
5018880	5022960	That was something else I missed in D-Box, though that would have been a good movie in
5022960	5023960	D-Box.
5023960	5024960	Inception.
5024960	5025960	Oh, really?
5025960	5026960	Yeah.
5026960	5029800	Well, D-Box is kind of really, really new, isn't it?
5029800	5030800	It's really, really new, yeah.
5030800	5033720	The theater out here that has it is like brand spanking new.
5033720	5038400	It's brand spanking new, and it's only in one theater, and it's only one row of seats,
5038400	5039760	so it's pretty-
5039760	5041760	It's two rows of seats in the theater I was in.
5041760	5042760	Oh.
5042760	5043760	Then maybe it is two rows.
5043760	5044760	I thought it was just one.
5044760	5047280	But yeah, it's only one theater that they have it in.
5047280	5048280	Oh, wow.
5048280	5049280	Very limited, but.
5049280	5050280	So.
5050280	5051860	It's fun, and it's one of 30 theaters that has it.
5051860	5056840	And that's, of course, the seats that move, the little motion seats that, you know.
5056840	5057840	It's fun.
5057840	5060120	It's completely unnecessary for a lot of movies.
5060120	5064200	Like the only movie I've seen in D-Box was the Resident Evil movie, and honestly, I'm
5064200	5068360	not a fan of the Resident Evil series and stuff, but that movie is so far away from
5068360	5070360	the Resident Evil game series.
5070360	5073080	It's more of like The Matrix now.
5073080	5076760	It was still pretty cool, and I think with Tron, though, just even watching Tron the
5076760	5080200	first time around, it's gonna be awesome with the D-Box stuff.
5080200	5081520	I'm really looking forward to it.
5081520	5082800	Let us know when you're going.
5082800	5085320	I even think, though, probably Wednesday during the day-
5085320	5088440	I'm glad I did the D-Box thing, but it was a little silly.
5088440	5090680	It was a little silly.
5090680	5092040	But it's cool to say you did it.
5092040	5093040	Which movie did you do it for?
5093040	5094040	Tron.
5094040	5095040	Oh, you did?
5095040	5096040	Yeah.
5096040	5097040	We saw Christmas Eve.
5097040	5098040	Oh.
5098040	5099040	Did you like it?
5099040	5100040	D-Box?
5100040	5105200	Because I really liked Tron, yes, but it was a little unnecessary, and it was kind of expensive.
5105200	5108200	Don't expect to get just, like, thrown around in the seats, because that ain't happening.
5108200	5112320	I mean, you can't adjust the intensity of it, but I would compare it a little more to
5112320	5115080	like Captain EO, where the movements in the seats are very subtle.
5115080	5118520	No, I just, there was a lot of the flying stuff in there, I thought that'd be pretty
5118520	5119520	cool.
5119520	5120520	Yeah, some of it's kind of neat.
5120520	5123480	But I kind of agree, and I think we had talked about it on the show a couple weeks ago, or
5123480	5127240	maybe, I don't remember, but one of the things that kind of takes you out of the reality
5127240	5132400	of it is that it is not an IMAX screen, and your field of vision is not completely the
5132400	5136400	movie, because it's a regular-sized movie screen, and I think if the screen were a lot
5136400	5140960	bigger or you had something else in those seats to take the rest of your field of vision
5140960	5145680	away, that would make it truly amazing, I think.
5145680	5149320	Or that they have to make it like pitch pitch black in there, which they can't, you know,
5149320	5153000	that's what they do on things like Star Tours and stuff, to kind of take you out of that,
5153000	5157080	but yeah, you know, they can't do that for emergency reasons and for people who want
5157080	5160600	to leave to go to the bathroom, so yeah.
5160600	5164880	I think D-Box still has some tweaking that they need to do, but it was, you know what,
5164880	5165880	it was fun.
5165880	5171880	To save up like the eight grand or whatever, get a home unit, they have them, it's compatible
5171880	5173320	with a lot of those movies.
5173320	5179840	You know, I wouldn't invest in that again unless it was a movie like Tron where I know
5179840	5186400	I love it and I want to see it a new way, and you know, that's really it.
5186400	5189920	DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says, so a D-Box is like Honey, I Shrunk the Audience
5189920	5190920	at Disney.
5190920	5192400	No, because those chairs don't move.
5192400	5196160	The movie's a lot better, too, because Honey, I Shrunk the Audience was terrible.
5196160	5199080	Well, those seats don't move, though, in Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.
5199080	5200600	A little bit, they do a little bit.
5200600	5201600	A little bit.
5201600	5203880	And I liked that because Eric Idle is in it.
5203880	5208240	There's a part when the baby picks up the audience and does this thing and-
5208240	5210000	You gotta admit, that part was pretty cool.
5210000	5211880	Yeah, but the movie itself was dopey.
5211880	5213600	Yeah, it was.
5213600	5215120	It really outstayed its welcome.
5215120	5218000	I mean, when was the last time they made a Honey, I blank the kids?
5218000	5220880	Well, you know, I had to say because Eric Idle was in it.
5220880	5224080	I am really sad that Rick Moranis is not getting more work.
5224080	5226120	I mean, seriously.
5226120	5227240	That was by his choice, I believe.
5227240	5229120	I believe he retired to raise his children.
5229120	5230840	Okay, well, then props to him.
5230840	5232840	Once you make Strange Brew, you can retire.
5232840	5235320	That's what it is, I guess.
5235320	5236320	All right.
5236320	5239880	I still think his best movie was My Blue Heaven.
5239880	5241760	But his children have to be grown up by now.
5241760	5243400	I mean, come on, go back.
5243400	5247760	The rumor is he'll cameo in Ghostbusters 3, but we'll see.
5247760	5250640	There's lots of rumors about that movie.
5250640	5252040	That's a day one for me.
5252040	5253040	All right.
5253040	5255360	Anyhow, Twitter topics coming up very soon.
5255360	5259520	Twitter.com slash O-L-R. First, we're going to get into some rapid fire news, but I also
5259520	5262160	have to give quick, quick plugs for the other shows.
5262160	5267560	Dark Sakura does a side podcast with her friends, Marin Marvel and Dan Shadow.
5267560	5270400	It's called Comic Insanity, and we have a Twitter now.
5270400	5273800	It's Comic Insanity without an I before the N.
5273800	5278600	And yes, we got a tweet from Comic Insanity tonight, so we'll read that in a little bit.
5278600	5279600	Yep.
5279600	5285240	And we, the podcast goes up every Tuesday at Infamous.net.
5285240	5288660	That's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.
5288660	5290160	Or the iTunes store, I'm sure.
5290160	5291160	We are in the iTunes store.
5291160	5292160	Awesome.
5292160	5294520	And you have to listen to it.
5294520	5297400	If you're a loyal O-L-R listener, you have to listen to that, too.
5297400	5299640	And you should also listen to Hoard House.
5299640	5303320	Even if you don't play Wow, you can hear Extrovert Make Dick and Fart Jokes.
5303320	5307440	Hoard House, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth, tapes on Thursdays, typically.
5307440	5311080	We don't want to be held to that, but usually if we don't do Thursday, we'll do Friday.
5311080	5314480	So later in the week is when we do our show and we put it right up on iTunes so you folks
5314480	5315640	can grab that.
5315640	5316760	And yeah, it's a fun show.
5316760	5320140	We always have a third random guest, and Dark Soccer has made it known she wants to come
5320140	5321480	on and be that guest.
5321480	5323440	So we're gonna work her into a future episode.
5323440	5325100	Sadly won't happen this week.
5325100	5328280	We're having our gala 10th episode special this week.
5328280	5329280	A look back...
5329280	5330280	10th anniversary?
5330280	5331280	Yes.
5331280	5333480	A look back at 10 hilarious episodes of The Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth.
5333480	5334480	It'll be a good time.
5334480	5337640	And very self-serving because that's what anniversary podcasts should be.
5337640	5339480	They're making a big, big deal for our...
5339480	5343120	Like I'm telling you, the 10th episode of Hoard House is a much bigger deal than 400
5343120	5344120	episodes of OLR.
5344120	5347280	I mean, I'm sorry, but that's, that's just...
5347280	5348280	It's a joke, Dark Soccer.
5348280	5349280	It's...
5349280	5350280	Get it?
5350280	5351280	I'm eating.
5351280	5355040	All right, let's get to some rapid fire news.
5355040	5357840	I can't make weird faces at you when I'm doing chipmunk cheeks.
5357840	5359640	We don't have a website, by the way.
5359640	5363120	We're not on Infamous.net and we are not even on OrangeLawnTrader.com.
5363120	5367840	We have a blog spot and really, that's just the shell for the podcast feed.
5367840	5368840	Awesome.
5368840	5370240	So, we don't have a website right now.
5370240	5372240	Before I forget, Geek Life.
5372240	5374120	Go to geek-life.com.
5374120	5377160	We're having a comic book giveaway, so go in there and read about it.
5377160	5380960	And by the way, speaking of Geek Life, Maren Marvel, who runs that and who has filled in
5380960	5385480	for me on this very program, she was on episode 8 of Hoard House, not this week's, but last
5385480	5386480	week's episode.
5386480	5387480	She did a phenomenal job.
5387480	5389540	So if you haven't heard that episode of Hoard House, you should go listen to it.
5389540	5390960	She did a very good job.
5390960	5397320	All right, let's go and to some rapid fire news, some of the news stories that we just
5397320	5401600	didn't find the long amounts of time to talk about in other parts of the show, but we want
5401600	5403320	to talk about them anyway.
5403320	5407000	APB Reloaded, they're doing a beta for it.
5407000	5411000	How ironic, because I actually participated in the original APB beta.
5411000	5416660	But if you're interested in that, they're going to be starting to close beta in February.
5416660	5423460	The official Twitter account, APB Reloaded, has more information on that.
5423460	5429320	And apparently they're going to be having, you can sign up on the official website.
5429320	5436160	And it is of course going to be free to play when it finally launches, unlike the original
5436160	5437160	APB.
5437160	5442800	And I didn't think APB was that bad of a game.
5442800	5447600	I thought it was actually pretty cool, but unfortunately it didn't last too long.
5447600	5452160	But definitely worth checking out, especially since it's going to be free to play.
5452160	5456920	The PSP Go has been hacked, not surprisingly.
5456920	5466800	The brand new, I guess, firmware, 6.31 and 6.35, have a new homebrew enabler for them.
5466800	5473640	And using this homebrew enabler, you're actually able to load the Prometheus ISO Loader, which
5473640	5479280	for those who don't know, it loads dumps of different PSP games.
5479280	5486800	And of course the PSP game to show off your hack would be Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep,
5486800	5493680	the PSP game that does not have a digital version of it on the PlayStation Network Store,
5493680	5497400	pissing off people that own a PSP Go.
5497400	5503480	And of course, this homebrew enabler doesn't really require any sort of tricks to get it
5503480	5509120	to work, so that's not good news for Sony, but I'm sure they'll try to find a way to
5509120	5512280	patch that out.
5512280	5519600	And then finally, there's a couple games in this series that have been available on the
5519600	5522220	IOS store.
5522220	5528560	Of course the Japanese App Store, or if you have a jailbroken iPhone or iPod, you can
5528560	5532320	also find these available as well.
5532320	5536320	It's Game Dev Story, and of course there's Game Dev Story 2.
5536320	5542800	Well now there's a brand new game that they have coming out called YY the Game Dealer.
5542800	5550680	It's basically a game retail store sim.
5550680	5555200	And the Game Dealer, you assume the role of a game store boss who must manage employees
5555200	5561040	and please customers, all while balancing the stock portfolio of game development studios,
5561040	5568700	and apparently also be able to offer customers food, and shoo-way mall rats from the free
5568700	5570700	food mini-games.
5570700	5574280	That's funny.
5574280	5580340	But I guess the Game Dealer is available on the Japanese App Store right now.
5580340	5582240	That sounds like fun.
5582240	5585920	That's real life for a lot of people that listen to this show, I'm sure.
5585920	5586920	Awesome.
5586920	5591440	Alright, let's go to Rock Band and what is coming out this week in Rock Band.
5591440	5593640	They're still kicking along with new releases.
5593640	5598480	Although this is a new release, I'm going to take a big fat pass on, but maybe some
5598480	5600040	of you out there are into this.
5600040	5603560	Linkin Park Pack comes out this week, January 11th.
5603560	5609720	Crawling in the End, Numb, Somewhere I Belong, Waiting for the End, and What I've Done.
5609720	5614920	All those songs are coming out for either 160 Microsoft Points, 200 Wii Points, or $1.99
5614920	5616420	on the PlayStation Store.
5616420	5622120	You can also get some Pro Guitar or Bass expansions for the song, In the End, and What I've Done.
5622120	5625960	Again, if you like Linkin Park, that is.
5625960	5629360	If you are a fan of Elder Scrolls and you were just sitting there tapping your fingers
5629360	5634560	waiting for Skyrim to come out, well maybe now is a good time to go back and visit Morrowind.
5634560	5639840	There's a brand new mod that just came out called Morrowind 2011, Morrowind 2011 was
5639840	5646080	a mod that was released last week, and it basically makes Morrowind just even more gorgeous
5646080	5647080	than it was originally.
5647080	5650760	Because remember Morrowind, I mean it was, for the time it was awesome graphics, but
5650760	5654680	man they really kind of upped the graphics, there was a bunch of mods out there that just
5654680	5656600	made the game look beautiful.
5656600	5661680	Well here's the thing though, it was out, but then it was pulled, because I guess this
5661680	5666400	used some other mods in it, and maybe the right people didn't quite get credit for it,
5666400	5669520	when some of the original modders complained on the Bethesda forums that their work was
5669520	5670760	being used.
5670760	5675440	So the original mod was pulled, but you guys know, once it hits the internet, it's never
5675440	5678080	truly off of the internet.
5678080	5682920	The author who originally made this whole expansion, he talked about it on his blog,
5682920	5688240	which is at Morrowind2011.wordpress.com, he said quote, in the end I'm just very disappointed
5688240	5692200	that I wasn't given a chance to correct the issues with the package, as I knew there were
5692200	5694980	issues that were in the process of being fixed or updated.
5694980	5698160	But the file is out on the internet, and it will be very hard for anyone to remove it
5698160	5699920	from all the sites.
5699920	5705600	Anyhow, one other thing, and I'm very excited about this, the Facebook Civilization game.
5705600	5707880	That's right, I'm getting excited about a Facebook game, what are you going to do about
5707880	5708880	it?
5708880	5712600	Civilization World starts its alpha testing phase on January 12th.
5712600	5717720	You can go sign up for it now, but it was a little weird, because I guess you need to
5717720	5721800	have like a team name and all this other stuff, I don't know, it didn't make a lot of sense
5721800	5724640	to me when I was filling it out, and I don't know if I want to play the alpha, I'll just
5724640	5725640	wait for the open beta.
5725640	5729240	But that means this game is mere months away, so very exciting, and when you look at the
5729240	5732880	graphics for it, it looks very like chibi and cute and kind of unlike any other Civ
5732880	5735680	game we've seen yet, so it's going to be very interesting.
5735680	5743160	Civ World, again, you can sign up at 2kgames.com slash civworld slash alpha.
5743160	5745540	Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?
5745540	5751960	More stuff, and some weird stuff among it, but including this weird ass mustache.
5751960	5753160	And I'll get into that.
5753160	5760960	Basically, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 is coming out, along with an extra mustache on the dude,
5760960	5762600	and jumping!
5762600	5767280	It will be on Playstation Network on Tuesday, February 1st, it will be $15, and then the
5767280	5772100	next day it will be on Xbox Live Arcade for 1200 Microsoft points.
5772100	5775680	And there will be challenge rooms and mustache!
5775680	5778040	So yeah.
5778040	5781040	It's very Burt Reynolds, porn-stache-looking.
5781040	5785080	Anyway, there's still more Sailor Moon stuff, Rob.
5785080	5787080	Did you know that?
5787080	5788880	Sailor Moon!
5788880	5796200	Well, Sailor Moon is having a new DS game come out in Italy!
5796200	5802600	Anamco Bandai Europe is bringing the first Sailor Moon DS game, and it's the second Sailor
5802600	5806120	Moon game that's being released outside of Japan.
5806120	5814040	And it's called La Luna Splenda, which, yeah, very Sailor Moon-y.
5814040	5818200	And they're saying it's adventure, fantasy, fun, action, these are the watchwords for
5818200	5820360	next spring.
5820360	5826880	Yeah, the last Sailor Moon game that I had was on the Super Nintendo.
5826880	5833560	And trailers for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 reveal two more characters.
5833560	5838320	And one of them I saw coming, the other one I'm like, why?
5838320	5840900	Even though it is cool, don't get me wrong, it's absolutely cool.
5840900	5845840	The first one we get is Hagar from Final Fight.
5845840	5848800	And what is it, Saturday Night Slam Masters?
5848800	5849800	That game was so awesome.
5849800	5852720	I wish we could get that on Xbox Live Arcade.
5852720	5856400	He's gonna be wrasslin' his way through Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5856400	5860720	And then Phoenix, which I'm like, why?
5860720	5866300	I think it's really why, but at the same time, very very cool with lots of Fuego, and she
5866300	5868740	freakin' has Dark Phoenix mode.
5868740	5869740	So that's really cool.
5869740	5873860	I like how the characters have multiple modes for them based on their level of, you know,
5873860	5874860	how powered up they are.
5874860	5876360	It's pretty cool.
5876360	5878200	So booyah.
5878200	5879960	This game is out, what, next month is it?
5879960	5880960	I can't remember.
5880960	5881960	Yes.
5881960	5882960	I get my release dates all mixed up.
5882960	5883960	That's gonna be exciting.
5883960	5884960	It's pretty cool.
5884960	5885960	Alright.
5885960	5887440	Well is that it for the rapid fire news?
5887440	5888440	Yarp.
5888440	5891240	Then we will get into the Twitter topics for tonight.
5891240	5897160	I'm gonna go to the tweeters, twitter.com slash o-l-r, where you show us your tweets
5897160	5900240	every Sunday night you're on this program.
5900240	5905200	Let's start off with a tweet from Comic Insanity, hmm, I didn't just hear a plug for them earlier
5905200	5906820	in the show or what have you.
5906820	5911960	It's a story about Street Fighter characters for WWE Raw versus SmackDown, which is this
5911960	5915720	trailer here, sorry for the extra music there, but I got linked to a YouTube.
5915720	5921600	I guess they have actually kind of used the editor mode to make like Ken and Vega and
5921600	5926800	Blanca, Dalsim, somebody having fun with the editor mode there.
5926800	5927800	That's kind of cute.
5927800	5928800	Oh yeah.
5928800	5932000	I like how they can get the interview with M. Bison and everything, kind of funny.
5932000	5934800	Yeah, we were talking about that on the show earlier.
5934800	5935800	Oh were you?
5935800	5936800	Yeah.
5936800	5937800	Yeah.
5937800	5942640	That's very well done and the moves are pretty much what you'd expect out of them.
5942640	5946240	You know, I don't really play a lot of these wrestling games, but that's pretty cool.
5946240	5947240	Dude, Dudley.
5947240	5948240	Yeah.
5948240	5949240	I like this too.
5949240	5952760	In the side, like what's recommended, it looks like there's a Felicia in one of these.
5952760	5954760	Like somebody did that.
5954760	5956000	Wow.
5956000	5959600	Big boobies on Felicia, alright anyway.
5959600	5967360	Moving on, going to SSJ100Matt on Twitter, our pal YYR will be at MAGFest in Washington
5967360	5970200	D.C. next week showing off his games.
5970200	5972560	Local listeners should stop by, MAGFest.org.
5972560	5976680	Well if you're in the Washington D.C. area and you happen to be going to MAGFest, say
5976680	5981120	hello to YYR for us because he does a lot of great indie games on the marketplace like
5981120	5986680	Snake 360 and the Shooting Gallery game and Falling.
5986680	5989960	Lots of good stuff so check that out at Ollie's booth.
5989960	5994880	Dark Tetsuya wants to relay a bit of bad news for us.
5994880	6000080	Apparently we had a BeatMania 2DX Resort Anthem machine at Roseville Golf Land.
6000080	6002640	It's been moved to Milpenis.
6002640	6004380	Bye.
6004380	6005380	That sucks.
6005380	6006380	Like did...
6006380	6007380	To hell with them.
6007380	6009480	Does that mean the whole 2DX machine's gone all together?
6009480	6011480	That blows.
6011480	6013480	F you Milpenis.
6013480	6014480	Milpenis.
6014480	6016920	Alright.
6016920	6017920	How mature of you.
6017920	6019040	I know, I'm so mature.
6019040	6022840	Tiger Claw wants to send us some links here.
6022840	6029200	Tiger Claw says Ion and Atari is teaming up for the iCade, a classic arcade machine setup
6029200	6030200	for your iPad.
6030200	6035400	Oh that's adorable, it's this cute little machine with tangible joystick and buttons
6035400	6041920	that you can put your iPad in and like play old games with.
6041920	6042920	That's cool.
6042920	6043920	I like that.
6043920	6050000	I love the fact that you can buy a, you know, I know it's a really expensive way of playing
6050000	6054680	something that you can get a million other ways, but it's still cute.
6054680	6057600	I say it was cute.
6057600	6059800	And one more tweet for us from Tiger Claw.
6059800	6065080	Microsoft confirms that Kinect PC support is coming.
6065080	6066080	Well good.
6066080	6069720	They should, as it should be, because if the modding community is so far ahead of them
6069720	6071080	it's almost a little bit embarrassing.
6071080	6073560	I mean it is coming, it already is here basically.
6073560	6077760	Well my official Kinect PC support is coming.
6077760	6082520	Steve Ballmer hinted at this support in his keynote speech there.
6082520	6084680	It is part of the company's larger plan.
6084680	6089000	Well, we certainly started out on Xbox and we're very focused in on gaming.
6089000	6092880	We're the number one game console in a lot of countries and we're very happy about that.
6092880	6096240	We're trying to do two major things though.
6096240	6101600	We're trying to move beyond gaming to include the world of socialization, movies, TV, and
6101600	6106240	music and we're trying to make the whole experience accessible to everybody in the family, not
6106240	6108000	just the traditional gamer.
6108000	6112680	So just expect this whole Kinect craze to grow, at least if Microsoft's keynote is to
6112680	6114640	be taken at face value.
6114640	6119520	Those are the tweets tonight at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Let's move into some more gaming
6119520	6120520	news.
6120520	6122000	Hey, guess what's coming up in just a little bit?
6122000	6123040	Listless!
6123040	6124240	And tonight's topic is?
6124240	6126840	Well, I'll tell you in a little bit.
6126840	6129600	We need, we're going to need somebody from the chat room to participate with us tonight,
6129600	6130600	aren't we?
6130600	6131600	We're going to need a fourth person.
6131600	6132600	We sure will.
6132600	6134000	So I better find someone quick.
6134000	6135720	I'm going to see, I have a particular person in mind.
6135720	6137040	I want to see if they want to participate.
6137040	6140440	If not, I'll open it up to anyone.
6140440	6144260	All right.
6144260	6148800	So this is kind of interesting and not too different than what they were doing.
6148800	6156540	I guess it's an improvement maybe, but THQ for homefronts, they're doing the online pass
6156540	6157740	thing again.
6157740	6161880	But this time, instead of just saying, hey, you know what, you better buy the game new
6161880	6168280	or pay the $10 and have no online play, they're saying, hey, you know what, you better buy
6168280	6175220	the game new or pay $10 or have limited online play.
6175220	6180080	They're going to allow you to play the multiplayer component of the game, however, you're only
6180080	6186480	going to be able to level up to level five versus the full game's level 75.
6186480	6190900	So kind of give you a little bit of a taste of the online portion of the game.
6190900	6194800	Of course, if you're going to want to play the online portion, you're probably going
6194800	6203200	to want to buy the game new or perhaps not rent the game.
6203200	6204240	I don't know.
6204240	6208560	It's still kind of a crappy way of doing things, but it's slightly better than not offering
6208560	6210780	any online component at all.
6210780	6213920	So now you get a demo of the online component.
6213920	6215760	That's basically what this boils down to.
6215760	6220880	That's kind of weird.
6220880	6222760	That's them combating the use sales.
6222760	6228080	But of course, I don't know if this is a game I'm particularly interested in, so we'll see.
6228080	6229080	Who knows?
6229080	6230080	It'll look cool.
6230080	6231080	All right.
6231080	6233480	Let's move on to another story here about the Mac App Store.
6233480	6234480	It is out.
6234480	6235480	It came out this week.
6235480	6240000	And guess what the number one thing that's being sold on the Mac App Store is right now?
6240000	6241000	Angry Birds.
6241000	6242000	That's right.
6242000	6243400	Angry Birds is the number one application.
6243400	6244960	Some other games are showing up in the top 10.
6244960	6248440	Of course, this changes day by day, so it might not be totally accurate, but some of
6248440	6252680	the early leaders were Flight Control HD and Chopper 2.
6252680	6253680	That's right.
6253680	6258520	Some of the same crap that you see on the iPhone and iPad is also dominating the Mac
6258520	6259520	App Store.
6259520	6265120	Now, if you don't know what the Mac App Store is, it's basically imagine Steam and Apple
6265120	6266120	kind of combined.
6266120	6272400	It's selling, I don't want to say PC games, but Mac games like for your actual Mac in
6272400	6275760	the same vein that you buy iPad and iPod stuff right now.
6275760	6276760	I think it's a great idea.
6276760	6281600	Well, it's a very logical idea that makes sense and especially because, you know, a
6281600	6284120	lot of these games are kind of cheaper this way.
6284120	6286800	Like games like Chopper 2, 99 cents.
6286800	6289720	Angry Birds, five bucks.
6289720	6294160	So I mean that's much cheaper than going into an actual store and paying 20 or even 40 bucks
6294160	6295160	for one of these.
6295160	6297400	Of course, not everything is so cheap.
6297400	6304160	I mean some programs like iMovie is 15 bucks, Aperture 80 bucks, you know, but it's a way
6304160	6307240	for them to sell, you know.
6307240	6309840	So interesting.
6309840	6313120	But what also is notable about this, hackers.
6313120	6316600	You know the old saying, hackers gonna hack.
6316600	6319240	So actually I just made up that saying.
6319240	6321880	So now we have haters gonna hate and hackers gonna hack.
6321880	6326440	Well, hackers gonna hack and they found the loophole in the Mac App Store.
6326440	6328480	They pirated Angry Birds already.
6328480	6330480	It took less than just a couple of days.
6330480	6332880	Yep, that's it.
6332880	6337000	Apparently all you have to do is like copy and paste this in-store purchase code and
6337000	6340240	yeah, you can get the games for free.
6340240	6341240	By the way, I love this.
6341240	6345160	The name of the group that hacked the games, Hackulous.
6345160	6346160	Get it?
6346160	6347160	Like Tapulous?
6347160	6352020	Well, Hackulous actually, they're responsible for the program Instalus which is what people
6352020	6356800	used to download pirated games on the iPod.
6356800	6361640	But I think, I keep thinking of like Tapulous who makes Tap Tap Revenge.
6361640	6364000	That would be fun.
6364000	6365000	Alright.
6365000	6369080	Alright, let's move on with some more stories, Dark Sakura.
6369080	6375320	Well, for Monster Hunter fans, this is actually kind of neat, actually video game companies
6375320	6381520	have been using different games to promote tourism in Japan.
6381520	6389720	My Nietzsche Daily News actually reported that Shibu Hot Springs in Nagano actually
6389720	6396600	worked with Capcom to have a Monster Hunter Portable 3 event go on because the town itself
6396600	6400060	was similar to the one used in the game.
6400060	6405040	And they had a lot of people go up, including people who said that they probably would have
6405040	6409120	never gone had there not been the Monster Hunter event.
6409120	6413760	And I've got a couple friends that live overseas who were totally into Monster Hunter and will
6413760	6417520	go to the special Capcom events and camp out outside their offices and stuff.
6417520	6419760	So, pretty crazy stuff.
6419760	6427840	Konami did something similar for Love Plus, the Atami Onsen, so they did the same thing.
6427840	6439080	And one was done, let me see if I can pronounce this right, Shakunage no Mori Botanical Park
6439080	6440800	in Mimata.
6440800	6443220	So they did something too.
6443220	6448000	That was for Kalanina Sekatsu Plus.
6448000	6451300	The reason why I was excited to hear you talk about this story is because I want to beat
6451300	6455640	the dead horse of when are we going to get a video game theme park?
6455640	6459200	Like seriously, Angry Birds is super popular.
6459200	6463480	Can't Angry Birds be a ride at a theme park now, even though I care less about the game?
6463480	6465120	Can we get Angry Birds the ride?
6465120	6469800	Can you imagine if you could go on a Mario Brothers roller coaster where as you're going
6469800	6474920	up, imagine, can you know that part of California Screamin' where it goes up, down, up, down,
6474920	6475920	up, down?
6475920	6476920	Is that my favorite part?
6476920	6477920	Yeah, a bunch of hills really fast.
6477920	6484320	What should happen is at the top of every hill on the Mario coaster, bling, bling.
6484320	6486840	Tell me they could not make an awesome theme park out of a video game.
6486840	6487840	They could do it.
6487840	6491360	I mean, I guess it would be all the licensing and so forth that would be a pain in the ass,
6491360	6494320	but still, make it happen.
6494320	6496440	They made a game in a theme park.
6496440	6497440	The Toy Story game.
6497440	6498440	Oh, that's true.
6498440	6499440	That was fun.
6499440	6500440	That Toy Story game is awesome.
6500440	6505400	And they are actually able to update it like an iPhone game or something with new levels
6505400	6506400	and things like that.
6506400	6509720	I haven't ridden it since Toy Story 3 came out, but I heard there's some newer stuff
6509720	6510720	in there.
6510720	6511720	Yeah, that was really fun.
6511720	6512720	Keep surprised.
6512720	6514480	And then the game came out.
6514480	6522400	But yeah, we could totally have a mall taken over by zombies.
6522400	6524400	Like a Dead Rising ride?
6524400	6525400	Maybe.
6525400	6526400	Perhaps.
6526400	6528840	Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
6528840	6532440	Loki, what would you want to see in a video game theme park?
6532440	6534680	I don't know.
6534680	6541960	I mean, I don't think it's really a good idea, actually.
6541960	6544360	You don't think it's a good idea?
6544360	6545560	Why not, hater?
6545560	6550960	I guess it'd be fun to see, like, giant rabbit people dressed up as the giant rabbits or
6550960	6551960	whatever.
6551960	6554120	That'd be kind of funny.
6554120	6558760	Or just imagine booth babes everywhere.
6558760	6563560	So you're suggesting a Hooters theme park.
6563560	6564800	They have a Hooters hotel.
6564800	6565800	Why not?
6565800	6566800	They do.
6566800	6568560	It's the ugliest looking hotel I've ever seen.
6568560	6573600	Can you imagine one of those station wagons with the wood grain paneling on the outside?
6573600	6575080	Turned into a hotel.
6575080	6577240	That would be the Hooters hotel.
6577240	6581720	They have wood grain paneling on the outside of the hotel.
6581720	6584320	Why?
6584320	6585320	I don't know.
6585320	6586320	Why?
6586320	6587320	Because they're tacky.
6587320	6590400	Alright, uh, let's move on to another story.
6590400	6592280	Loki, what do you got for us?
6592280	6593880	Ah, yes.
6593880	6595560	Um, let's see.
6595560	6605720	We were talking a little bit about, um, um, some of the stuff for, uh, what was it, uh,
6605720	6612800	Skyrim actually, um, the Elder Scrolls, ah, Elder Scrolls game.
6612800	6617920	They were talking about some new stuff that's, um, available actually coming from the Game
6617920	6618920	Informer magazine.
6618920	6621560	They have a little piece on it in their new issue.
6621560	6626600	Some of the differences are going to be in this game as compared to Oblivion, for example.
6626600	6630560	Um, one is going to be the way that the game actually levels.
6630560	6635200	The player's levels are now going to be more balanced, um, because I guess actually in
6635200	6639960	the game, much like Fallout 3 and that kind of stuff, as you level up, the enemies level
6639960	6640960	up as well.
6640960	6646320	Well, in Oblivion, it got to the point where it was pretty damn impossible to be, um, able
6646320	6650840	to go up against some of the enemies because they would just be leveling up with you.
6650840	6654080	I don't like role-playing games where they level completely up with you.
6654080	6657840	I think at some point you have to be able to overpower them a little bit.
6657840	6658840	A little bit.
6658840	6663960	I do agree that it should be a difficulty setting, if something like that.
6663960	6668160	Um, anyways, they're going to have a, it's going to scale, you know, to the player's
6668160	6670840	level, but it's going to be more balanced, they're saying.
6670840	6677840	Um, it says, uh, foes will likely be easily bested by using, um, you know, some of the
6677840	6681920	new features in the game, like dual-wielding, I guess is going to be a new feature that
6681920	6682920	they're going to have.
6682920	6688760	You can equip any item or spell to either hand using both simultaneously in combat.
6688760	6691160	Um, so that's pretty cool.
6691160	6701800	Um, and then of course, uh, they were saying that, um, I guess, uh, also the leveling system,
6701800	6706400	they're saying, uh, no longer binds players to classifying by a set of skills.
6706400	6713760	It says, players can pick and choose from the game's 18 abilities, um, which level up
6713760	6719000	while using them simultaneously, unlocking perks with each level.
6719000	6721600	So it basically sounds like it's going to be Fallout.
6721600	6725520	And then they're also going to have, yeah, and then they're going to also include, uh,
6725520	6730840	new weapon crafting systems, improved character creation tools, etc.
6730840	6734920	And that's pretty cool, character creation-wise, because I believe they're, uh, their tools
6734920	6736600	are pretty impressive in Oblivion.
6736600	6740400	The only problem I found with Oblivion though, is I can create any character I want, as long
6740400	6745440	as they were butt-fucking-ugly, because that's all that that, that tool creates, is really
6745440	6748280	ugly-looking people.
6748280	6750560	You know, the Fallout one isn't much better, to be honest.
6750560	6754560	I don't know how much you've played around in Fallout 3, but, uh, a lot of the characters
6754560	6756360	are, are fugs there too.
6756360	6758440	So, sorry to say.
6758440	6762760	Uh, by the way, SolarFlare reminds me in chat room, like FF8, Rob?
6762760	6765920	Yes, exactly like that.
6765920	6771800	Alright, um, one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to List List tonight.
6771800	6772800	I'm so excited.
6772800	6773800	I haven't even told you guys the topic.
6773800	6776800	I think it's a fun topic tonight, but if you were paying attention earlier in the show,
6776800	6777800	we dropped a hint.
6777800	6778800	Yep.
6778800	6779800	So maybe you figured it out.
6779800	6782480	And I finally got a guest for us, and it's an exciting guest that we haven't had on the
6782480	6783480	show in a while.
6783480	6784480	Yep.
6784480	6785480	So, uh, we'll get to that in a minute.
6785480	6790640	Uh, want to go to this story about EA pulling the plug on some old games.
6790640	6794440	That's right, the servers are getting shut down for some old games, because that fee
6794440	6799000	you pay to use Xbox Live, well, it doesn't pay to keep old shit running.
6799000	6803800	Now, the good news is, most of this stuff is old sports games.
6803800	6806000	You know, games that have been replaced with newer versions.
6806000	6810280	For example, NCAA Basketball, 08 and 09, gone.
6810280	6816760	NCAA Football, 07, 08, 09 in 2010, gone, at least the 2010 version on the PS2, specifically.
6816760	6819280	NHL 08 and 09, they're out as well.
6819280	6821660	So it's mostly old sports games.
6821660	6828600	It also impacts series like Madden, Fight Night Round 3, FIFA, some of those games.
6828600	6830640	But they weren't the only ones impacted.
6830640	6836280	If you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings, the Battle for Middle Earth, 1 or 2 on PC,
6836280	6838080	those servers are gone.
6838080	6843440	Closing next week, Battle for Middle Earth 2 on Xbox 360, as well as the Rise of the
6843440	6845700	Witch King, which I guess was the expansion.
6845700	6847640	Not the Lich King, guys, the Witch King.
6847640	6848640	There's a difference.
6848640	6853720	Also, closing on January 17th, The Sims Carnival.
6853720	6857440	So if you were a Sims Carnival fan, but there must not have been that many of you, because
6857440	6861400	EA's shutting the server down, you will not be able to play anymore after January 17th.
6861400	6864240	And there's this contingent out there going, there was a Sims Carnival?
6864240	6865240	Exactly.
6865240	6869740	Now, February 8th is when most of the sports games are scheduled to close.
6869740	6872180	To be honest, this is nothing new.
6872180	6875640	You know, it's always a bummer when it's games that aren't really sports games that upgrade
6875640	6879080	every year, but, you know, it's kind of inevitable.
6879080	6883160	And again, they feel like they can pull the plug because you're not playing them.
6883160	6887000	But for those people that game on a budget and buy old games used, because, you know,
6887000	6890320	you can get, like, last year's sports games super cheap.
6890320	6891320	For a song.
6891320	6892320	I know.
6892320	6893320	It's super cheap.
6893320	6895800	So, you know, budget gamers, that's a huge way they can kind of do it.
6895800	6899040	Unfortunately, they don't get that same perk.
6899040	6902760	Oh, well, what can you do?
6902760	6904760	Guess what it's time for, guys?
6904760	6905760	Party!
6905760	6909000	Big American Party!
6909000	6915520	It's time for Listless tonight, boys and girls.
6915520	6916520	I'm so excited.
6916520	6917520	We haven't done one of these in a while.
6917520	6922960	The way Listless works, we are going to be forming the definitive list.
6922960	6925440	And there is no arguing once this list is complete.
6925440	6927680	This is a very scientific method.
6927680	6932960	And it involves you guys in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
6932960	6935400	We're going to bring in a fourth person to play along with us tonight.
6935400	6937720	Let's get him on the line.
6937720	6942880	I'll dumb down the music here while we give our friend a call.
6942880	6947960	Now hopefully it works, because that would be a little embarrassing if it didn't work.
6947960	6952040	But sometimes, you know, live show and connections can be a little bit spotty.
6952040	6953040	Hello!
6953040	6954040	Hi!
6954040	6955040	Hi!
6955040	6957880	Is this Breslul?
6957880	6958880	It usually is.
6958880	6960880	Oh, lord, hang up, Rob.
6960880	6963120	Long time no talk, my friend, how are you?
6963120	6964120	I'm kidding, kidding.
6964120	6965520	Happy New Year, Dark Sakura.
6965520	6966520	Jeez.
6966520	6967520	I'm kidding.
6967520	6968520	Heart, heart, heart, heart.
6968520	6971120	What are your New Year's resolutions, Breslul?
6971120	6972120	It doesn't matter.
6972120	6973120	I've broken them all already.
6973120	6976920	I did my first episode of USL, so those are all out the window.
6976920	6977920	Congratulations.
6977920	6981360	If you don't know Breslul, not only has he guessed it on the show a little bit in the
6981360	6982360	past.
6982360	6983360	Not so much lately, though, sadly.
6983360	6985760	But that's because he's too busy doing another show.
6985760	6990800	He's big time now, a host on Under Sedation Live, which is Saturday nights on the All
6990800	6992400	Games Network.
6992400	6997640	And with Iguana Girl, who's been on this show as well, Jessica Harper, Travis Donovan, who
6997640	6999200	I'm afraid to have on this show.
6999200	7002280	Oh, but Rob's never been on Under Sedation Live, has he?
7002280	7003280	That's where I grew up.
7003280	7004800	That was my old stomping grounds.
7004800	7008440	Apparently, this is our 10th year doing it, and we didn't even realize it.
7008440	7009440	Wow.
7009440	7013180	And here I was talking about OLR celebrating the 400th episode.
7013180	7015120	But you know, USL is taking a lot of breaks.
7015120	7016520	I don't even know if they've gotten up to 400.
7016520	7017520	I hate to say it, DMN.
7017520	7018520	I don't know.
7018520	7019520	Whoa, hey.
7019520	7020520	Blast from the past there.
7020520	7021520	Oh, sorry, Breslul.
7021520	7022520	Because I'm looking at...
7022520	7023520	Never mind.
7023520	7026800	I don't want to say, but I'm looking at something and it still says the old name.
7026800	7027800	DDRFreak?
7027800	7028800	No.
7028800	7029800	Yes, I'm reading DDRFreak still.
7029800	7032200	I was just looking at all the porn posts today.
7032200	7033200	All right.
7033200	7038200	Hey, I wanted to have you on specifically to talk about USL madness.
7038200	7039440	Yes.
7039440	7042960	We extended the deadline because not a lot of people submitted.
7042960	7049280	Basically, what you do is you get a list of your 25 most favorite video games of all time.
7049280	7054600	They can be as far back as Atari 2600 and television, and they can be as modern as Xbox
7054600	7056460	360, PS3, PC.
7056460	7058220	They can even be your favorite arcade games.
7058220	7062640	We actually have had one nomination for Skee-Ball, believe it or not.
7062640	7063640	Okay.
7063640	7064640	Yeah.
7064640	7065640	Good choice, actually.
7065640	7066640	Skee-Ball's pretty awesome.
7066640	7070100	But basically, what you do is you get that list together, order it from one to 25, one
7070100	7073920	being Super Metroid, 25 being Minecraft or something.
7073920	7078000	I like how you told everybody what to make their number ones.
7078000	7081000	Your number one, you're just going to put Super Metroid next to it because otherwise
7081000	7082000	you're crazy.
7082000	7083000	Yeah.
7083000	7086320	Then you submit those to uslmadness at gmail.com.
7086320	7089000	Voting, actually, we extended it a week.
7089000	7094120	It closes tonight at midnight Pacific, which is, if you're listening live, less than four
7094120	7095120	hours from now.
7095120	7098240	All right, procrastinators, I expect the live listeners to get cracking.
7098240	7099620	Do you accept partial lists?
7099620	7104040	What if somebody's like, I can't get to 25, but I've got 10, would you take that?
7104040	7109600	I will do that, but those games won't get as good consideration as if you do a full
7109600	7110600	list.
7110600	7116080	So then you need to just throw in some bullshit, like Mappy, throw in... I was trying to get
7116080	7117080	Dark Soccer.
7117080	7118080	Elevator action!
7118080	7119080	What's that?
7119080	7123120	Some people have thrown out Minecraft, and Minecraft's currently in the top 30.
7123120	7124120	Wow.
7124120	7125120	Yeah.
7125120	7129400	Minecraft's in the top 30, Pac-Man's in the top 30, Fallout might get a one seed this
7129400	7130400	year.
7130400	7131400	Wow.
7131400	7132400	That's how nuts it is.
7132400	7133400	Nice.
7133400	7135480	Now, DDR Dollar Bill's in the chat room saying, fuck Minecraft.
7135480	7139040	So DDR Dollar Bill, that means you better get your list in so you can bump Minecraft
7139040	7140040	down a little bit.
7140040	7141040	Yeah.
7141040	7143320	And then we will announce the brackets sometime this coming week.
7143320	7147080	All right, uslmadness at gmail.com.
7147080	7149080	Super Metroid's a one seed, right?
7149080	7150080	No.
7150080	7151080	What?
7151080	7152080	It's a two seed right now.
7152080	7153080	What?
7153080	7154080	Yeah, I know.
7154080	7158120	This whole contest is a sham.
7158120	7159480	I know your listeners are insane.
7159480	7160480	I'm not sure which.
7160480	7162480	All right, you ready to play listless with us tonight?
7162480	7163480	I am.
7163480	7166960	I actually have a list ready of something that I don't know anything about.
7166960	7167960	All right.
7167960	7168960	So here we go.
7168960	7170600	Because I don't tell you the topics in advance.
7170600	7172880	That would never happen in the magic of radio.
7172880	7173880	All right.
7173880	7175640	Let's tell the listeners already what the topic is.
7175640	7176640	All right.
7176640	7179840	If you were listening in part A, I said pay attention when Loki did the story about THQ
7179840	7183720	and Mattel are entering a game deal, which means we might get a Masters of the Universe
7183720	7185000	video game.
7185000	7187080	So we thought, you know what we should do?
7187080	7192080	Let's talk about toys that we think ought to be video games because, you know, if we
7192080	7196240	limited it to just Mattel, I don't know what's Mattel and what's not, like Barbie's Mattel,
7196240	7197240	right?
7197240	7198240	I don't know.
7198240	7203320	So we're going to just say toys in general, board games, whatever, anything you can find
7203320	7208880	in the toy aisle at Target or Walmart or Toys R Us, I should say is fair game, except for
7208880	7209960	like diapers.
7209960	7211940	Like I don't think they should make a video game out of diapers.
7211940	7213640	So if you guys have diapers on your list, please remove them.
7213640	7216120	It has to be an actual marketed toy item.
7216120	7217440	Yes, it needs to be a toy.
7217440	7219160	So Babies R Us items don't count.
7219160	7220160	All right, everybody.
7220160	7222360	Now chat room, here's what you guys need to do.
7222360	7226320	You need to start suggesting things in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com because
7226320	7231080	if one of the hosts ends up duplicating something, we usually turn to chat to figure out how
7231080	7234200	to fill in the gaps there.
7234200	7238080	Also the chat plays a very important part in this because what's going to happen, we're
7238080	7242160	going to go around and everybody's going to name their top three, myself, Loki Dark Sakura
7242160	7244660	and Bresloh will each name their top three.
7244660	7248260	Then each of us will go around and take one item off of the list.
7248260	7250360	Something will not be worthy of the list.
7250360	7254580	That will leave us with a list of eight and you guys in our chat room vote to come up
7254580	7256080	with a definitive list of three.
7256080	7260600	I know that sounds really complicated you guys, but that's why it's a scientific process.
7260600	7262160	Science is hard y'all.
7262160	7264080	All right.
7264080	7265080	Be careful guys.
7265080	7268160	We're about to try science.
7268160	7270000	She blinded me with science.
7270000	7272440	All right, let's get into the list.
7272440	7274000	Why don't we start tonight?
7274000	7275000	How about Loki?
7275000	7279360	I don't know how often you start in listless, but tonight you're starting this listless.
7279360	7282200	What toy ought to be a video game?
7282200	7289000	This is a terrible, terrible answer, but I'm going to do it anyways because it's simple.
7289000	7290000	It's simple.
7290000	7291000	Ball.
7291000	7292000	Ball.
7292000	7293000	Ball.
7293000	7294000	Okay.
7294000	7299200	Tell us how the game ball works.
7299200	7300280	Really can be anything.
7300280	7303640	You see balls are very versatile toys.
7303640	7306760	You can play whatever games you want with them.
7306760	7307760	Ball.
7307760	7312920	Press A to bounce.
7312920	7316640	It'd be like one of those reverse sandbox games or something.
7316640	7322160	It's Minecraft, but with balls.
7322160	7323880	I can see the commercial now.
7323880	7325280	Come play with our balls.
7325280	7326480	All right.
7326480	7327480	I'll go next.
7327480	7328480	My number three choice.
7328480	7332080	My number three choice for game or toy they should make into a game.
7332080	7335160	Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven.
7335160	7338520	That was on my list and I removed it, Rob.
7338520	7340620	All right.
7340620	7341620	So Cooking Mama.
7341620	7343640	Wouldn't that be in the reverse though?
7343640	7344720	What do you mean?
7344720	7350840	They're like kind of making a video game into a toy.
7350840	7353840	The toys already existed ever since I was a little girl.
7353840	7357520	The Easy Bake Ovens have been around forever and now Cooking Mama is going to take that
7357520	7365000	old toy and she's going to make fine cuisine with nothing but a light bulb.
7365000	7366000	But no.
7366000	7367000	Don't worry, Bresl.
7367000	7368000	Mama will fix it.
7368000	7369000	All right.
7369000	7370000	Oh God.
7370000	7372720	You won't ever be eating poop in Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven.
7372720	7375920	You might be eating mud pies though because I don't know.
7375920	7380240	Haven't they made Pooping Mama yet?
7380240	7383440	There's Babysitting Mama where you have to change poopy diapers.
7383440	7384880	I mean, you mean shake the baby?
7384880	7385880	I mean, hi.
7385880	7386880	All right.
7386880	7389200	So Dark Sakura, what is your number three answer?
7389200	7390520	Toy that ought to be a game.
7390520	7392560	The erector set level building game.
7392560	7397040	We have to build the whole thing out of erector sets and then you run your little guy through
7397040	7398040	the erector set.
7398040	7399040	Okay.
7399040	7401680	Oh, it's kind of like a Lego game, but not because it's an erector set.
7401680	7402680	Kind of a little big planet.
7402680	7406000	Only you build the whole thing out of erector sets.
7406000	7407000	Wow.
7407000	7408000	All right.
7408000	7409000	Well, screw chat.
7409000	7411240	They're not given the answers that come on the show.
7411240	7412240	You are, Bresl.
7412240	7414440	It doesn't matter if chat took them.
7414440	7416040	Here's my throwaway choice then.
7416040	7417040	All right.
7417040	7418040	Fine.
7418040	7419040	Homies.
7419040	7420840	Oh God.
7420840	7421840	Little homies.
7421840	7422840	Those little toys.
7422840	7423840	The homies.
7423840	7424840	Oh no.
7424840	7425840	Yeah.
7425840	7426840	I haven't seen those in forever.
7426840	7428760	You want to hear something ironic?
7428760	7430580	There was a little homies game.
7430580	7431580	Was there?
7431580	7432580	Yes, there was.
7432580	7433580	Wow.
7433580	7434580	Well, they need to do a better one.
7434580	7436900	What would the homies game be Bresl?
7436900	7437900	I don't know.
7437900	7439040	Saints Road 3.
7439040	7441600	It was a kart racing game is what it was.
7441600	7442880	Oh God.
7442880	7443880	Screw that.
7443880	7444880	They need to do it again.
7444880	7445880	All right.
7445880	7448960	I love some of the choices that are coming out in chat, by the way.
7448960	7449960	All right.
7449960	7450960	Number two pick.
7450960	7452600	Loki, who brought us ball.
7452600	7457800	What is your number two pick for Toy They Oughta Make Into a Video Game?
7457800	7460840	If you say top, I'm coming down to Sacramento and punching you.
7460840	7461840	The same what?
7461840	7462840	Top.
7462840	7463840	Top.
7463840	7465840	No one plays at tops.
7465840	7466840	No.
7466840	7467840	Strag.
7467840	7468840	No.
7468840	7469840	No.
7469840	7470840	My next one.
7470840	7477480	I don't know if anyone remembers these, but they used to have these giant sets you could
7477480	7480400	get called Marble Mat.
7480400	7482720	It was Domino Rally.
7482720	7483720	Fuck yes.
7483720	7484720	Domino Rally.
7484720	7485720	Domino Rally was awesome.
7485720	7490320	Now granted, I know that they have a game called Domino Rally, Mr. Domino, but that's
7490320	7491320	a different thing.
7491320	7492320	No.
7492320	7493320	Fuck Mr. Domino.
7493320	7494320	I know it's tight.
7494320	7495680	You're talking about dominoes that do loop-de-loops and all the crazy stunts, right?
7495680	7496680	Yes.
7496680	7497680	All right.
7497680	7498680	Yeah.
7498680	7499680	I support you there.
7499680	7500680	You can build levels out of dominoes.
7500680	7501680	Yeah.
7501680	7502680	Awesome.
7502680	7503680	I like that pick.
7503680	7504680	Domino Rally is Logie's number two pick.
7504680	7505680	I like that.
7505680	7512360	My number two pick tonight, Light Bright Dance Dance Revolution.
7512360	7518160	Because I can think of no better way to rave than with Light Bright.
7518160	7520960	Use your Light Bright to throw sweet rave parties.
7520960	7521960	Exactly.
7521960	7527480	Sandstorm is already a confirmed song in Light Bright DDR, just so you all know.
7527480	7528480	Oh God.
7528480	7530080	It'd be awesome and you know it.
7530080	7534880	It'd be rave and the kids would be getting high and playing their Light Bright DDR.
7534880	7536520	All right.
7536520	7540280	Dark Sakura, what is your number two choice for Toy They Oughta Make a Video Game?
7540280	7542400	Bratz Doom.
7542400	7548360	As in they're all the monsters and you have to go around shooting them with the BFG.
7548360	7550120	Bratz in Doom.
7550120	7551120	Bratz Doom.
7551120	7552600	Bratz Doom.
7552600	7553600	Shoot the Bratz.
7553600	7554600	All right.
7554600	7556320	I like that.
7556320	7559320	Would the final level have Paula Abdul because she was involved with a movie.
7559320	7560320	Or no, wait.
7560320	7561320	She got fired from the movie, I think.
7561320	7564560	Dude, you have to be a special kind of stupid to get fired from the Bratz movie.
7564560	7569000	Or a special kind of high.
7569000	7570000	Wall Drugs.
7570000	7571000	All right.
7571000	7572000	Loki.
7572000	7573000	What is your...
7573000	7574000	I'm sorry.
7574000	7575000	Not Loki.
7575000	7576000	Bresloh.
7576000	7577000	So you guys are so the same.
7577000	7578000	It's hard to tell you guys apart.
7578000	7579400	One of you is sitting right here.
7579400	7580400	All right.
7580400	7584960	Bresloh, what is your number two choice for Toy They Oughta Make a Video Game?
7584960	7588880	I really hope one of you three have heard of this board game, but I'm going to say Dominion.
7588880	7592200	Haven't heard of it.
7592200	7593760	What the hell is Dominion?
7593760	7597320	It's basically a kind of reverse magic where you start out with a deck and there's a set
7597320	7601920	of cards out and you pay money to buy cards and then use them later.
7601920	7605360	It's kind of like Settlers of Catanesh.
7605360	7606360	It's fun.
7606360	7608240	And they should make it into an Xbox Live Arcade game.
7608240	7609240	So Dominion.
7609240	7610240	All right.
7610240	7611240	I'll take your word for it.
7611240	7612240	All right.
7612240	7613240	Cool story, bro.
7613240	7614240	All right.
7614240	7615240	Loki.
7615240	7616240	Cool story, bro.
7616240	7617240	What's your number one...
7617240	7618240	Wait.
7618240	7619240	What's your number one call?
7619240	7627320	Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set, Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally,
7627320	7630920	Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, and Dominion.
7630920	7633760	Loki, what is your number one pick?
7633760	7639400	I'll take your Bratz Doom and I'll raise you Dead Rising Mole Madness.
7639400	7641680	That's great.
7641680	7642900	That's great.
7642900	7647600	Not only do you have to fight off zombies, but you also have to find good deals on clothing
7647600	7651160	and other couture.
7651160	7652520	I really should have put that...
7652520	7653920	What's that dating game called?
7653920	7657160	I really should have put that on my list and I didn't.
7657160	7658160	Girl Talk?
7658160	7659160	Girl Talk.
7659160	7665480	Actually, they have this really shitty looking game that I've seen at Target.
7665480	7666580	It's something about like...
7666580	7668700	It's called like Oops, That's the Truth or something.
7668700	7670240	What the hell is this game called?
7670240	7675840	It's some type of like weird party game that they're selling as an Xbox 360 game.
7675840	7677320	Oh, um...
7677320	7678320	Somebody's had to have heard of this.
7678320	7679320	No, I know what you're talking about.
7679320	7680880	It's the Truth or Lies?
7680880	7682240	Yes, that game.
7682240	7685800	No, it's called Truth or Bargain Bit, actually.
7685800	7687280	Exactly, very soon.
7687280	7688960	Alright, my number one pick.
7688960	7692420	I picked a serious one just like Breslöl did for his last one.
7692420	7696960	My serious number one answer, Millborn on Xbox Live Arcade.
7696960	7699160	That would be pretty badass too.
7699160	7702720	Millborn is like the best French card game ever made.
7702720	7707660	It might be the only French card game ever made, but damn it, it's awesome.
7707660	7709920	So Millborn, and if you have...
7709920	7712400	The whole point of that game is to fuck your buddy.
7712400	7713920	That's the whole point of the game.
7713920	7714920	Awesome.
7714920	7717640	I just gave us the explicit tag.
7717640	7718640	Thank you very much.
7718640	7719640	Good night, everybody.
7719640	7720640	You're welcome.
7720640	7723000	That's why you're on this show tonight, to make sure we earn the explicit rating.
7723000	7726900	So if you've never played Millborn, it's kind of like a racing game that you do at cards,
7726900	7729220	and Breslöl is right.
7729220	7733640	You fuck your friends by puncturing their tires, getting them pulled over, making the
7733640	7734920	green lights turn red.
7734920	7735920	It's awesome.
7735920	7737560	I love Millborn.
7737560	7738560	Alright.
7738560	7739560	It's good.
7739560	7740560	Let's see.
7740560	7741560	Where are we going to next?
7741560	7742560	How about Dark Soccer?
7742560	7743560	What's your number one answer?
7743560	7749040	My Little Pony Deathmatch.
7749040	7750040	I think it should be...
7750040	7752840	Like they bite and get rabies and stuff.
7752840	7756320	I think it should be like Derby Owners Club, but with My Little Pony where you can whip
7756320	7757760	the horses when they're bad.
7757760	7761140	And whichever one is last gets shot.
7761140	7764040	Michael Vick presents My Little Pony Deathmatch.
7764040	7765040	Okay.
7765040	7766840	How about we call it...
7766840	7767840	Here's the name.
7767840	7768840	My Little...
7768840	7769840	Death Race My Little Pony.
7769840	7770840	Alright.
7770840	7774920	And if you pre-order now, we'll give you a year's supply of Elmer's Glue.
7774920	7776520	I was thinking that.
7776520	7777520	Alright.
7777520	7781000	Death Race My Little Pony is Dark Soccer's number one answer.
7781000	7782520	Dark Soccer, I'm noticing a trend here.
7782520	7785040	I think you have some anger issues.
7785040	7786520	Somebody's homicidal tonight.
7786520	7787520	Alright.
7787520	7790640	Hello, what is your number one answer?
7790640	7795600	This was mentioned in the chat, and this is basically pong on crack in board game form.
7795600	7796600	Crossfire.
7796600	7800120	Oh shit, I remember the commercials for those.
7800120	7802400	That's the one where you have like all those steel balls, right?
7802400	7803400	Yeah.
7803400	7804400	And you shoot...
7804400	7807560	My mother would never buy me that when I was growing up.
7807560	7808560	She was a bitch.
7808560	7809560	My mom wouldn't buy me that either.
7809560	7810560	Alright.
7810560	7811560	I love my mom.
7811560	7813840	There was a pimple table that used that same thing called Hyper Ball.
7813840	7814840	Really?
7814840	7815840	Crossfire was awesome.
7815840	7817520	All the little boys wanted one.
7817520	7818520	Probably some of the girls, too.
7818520	7820080	I bet Dark Soccer wanted Crossfire, too.
7820080	7821480	Yeah, my mom wouldn't get it for me.
7821480	7822480	Ah.
7822480	7823480	But she got it for my brothers.
7823480	7824480	Go figure.
7824480	7825480	Our parents were all mean.
7825480	7827600	Loki, did your parents buy you Crossfire?
7827600	7830560	I didn't want it, but I got to play it, and it was fun.
7830560	7831560	Not pointless.
7831560	7832560	One moment.
7832560	7835360	Shoot a bunch of balls at this other thing with a ball in the middle.
7835360	7838040	You alright, Bresloh?
7838040	7841560	Bresloh needed to put the show on hold for a minute so he could tend to some business.
7841560	7843560	BRB, poopin'.
7843560	7847520	Alright, well here's the list of sustains right now.
7847520	7854280	Ball, Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally,
7854280	7861240	Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dominion, Dead Rising Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade,
7861240	7864600	Death Race My Little Pony, and Crossfire.
7864600	7865720	This is hard.
7865720	7867400	We have to eliminate some of these from the list.
7867400	7868400	I don't know if I can.
7868400	7871000	Alright, but we got, that's how it works.
7871000	7874320	So Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7874320	7875320	Homies.
7875320	7878040	It's already got a game in it, it's crap.
7878040	7879280	Homies is gone.
7879280	7881000	Bresloh's back from his poop.
7881000	7882000	Welcome back.
7882000	7883000	Alright.
7883000	7886400	Let's see, my turn.
7886400	7887400	This is hard.
7887400	7889680	I don't want to eliminate any of these.
7889680	7892760	I'm sorry, I hate to do this because I know the chatters probably love this one.
7892760	7896600	I've got to eliminate ball because I just don't get it.
7896600	7899560	What is the game?
7899560	7901600	That sounds like a tech demo to me, so I'm sorry.
7901600	7903720	Ball has been stricken from the list.
7903720	7906000	Dark Sakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7906000	7908200	Only for lack of familiarity, Dominion.
7908200	7909200	Aww.
7909200	7914200	Poor Bresloh got two of them yanked from the list, but that's okay, Bresloh, because you're
7914200	7917680	obviously not going to eliminate your own, so you get at least one on there.
7917680	7920800	Bresloh, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7920800	7924800	I'm going to eliminate Crossfire, I mean Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven.
7924800	7925800	Aww.
7925800	7929160	Why are you eliminating Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven?
7929160	7935120	Because only on the guarantee that my Xbox will spit out delicious treats, which I don't
7935120	7937920	think that technology is quite there yet.
7937920	7941360	Not yet, not until we get the holodeck and how it makes food and everything.
7941360	7944160	All right, so here's the list that our chatters are going to vote on.
7944160	7947640	You're going to vote for your number one and number two pick, and you're going to send
7947640	7950720	them over a private message to Skye in the chat room.
7950720	7953800	Please label your number one and your number two choices, or I'm going to assume what you
7953800	7957320	list first is number one and what you list second is number two.
7957320	7959440	So here is the...
7959440	7960520	You all right Bresloh?
7960520	7961520	You need a minute?
7961520	7965280	All right, so here is the list as it stands right now.
7965280	7971640	Erector Set Level Building Game, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dead Rising
7971640	7977640	Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade, Death Race My Little Pony, and Crossfire.
7977640	7983240	Chatters, it's now in your hands to come up with a definitive list of the top three toys
7983240	7984840	that need to be video games.
7984840	7990320	And while you're at it, Bresloh, repeat the March Madness email.
7990320	7991320	I will do that.
7991320	7995140	It is uslmadnessatgmail.com.
7995140	8001000	You have about three and a half hours to get those submissions in if you're listening on
8001000	8002000	the podcast.
8002000	8007960	I'm sorry, the expiration has gone past, but we will have voting up probably by the time
8007960	8010040	you're listening to this.
8010040	8013560	And I noticed that somebody in studio just sent you an email.
8013560	8017240	I think I already did one before, but I did it again just to be safe.
8017240	8021600	I don't think I got one from you, but I'm assuming that it now rides with Woklockera,
8021600	8022600	so...
8022600	8025600	You might be right, actually.
8025600	8026600	All right.
8026600	8027600	Yeah.
8027600	8028600	So there you go.
8028600	8030040	Thank you so much for playing our dumb little game tonight, Bresloh.
8030040	8031120	We really appreciate it.
8031120	8034680	Best of luck with uslmadness and everything that goes on at Understation Live.
8034680	8036960	Tell the others we said hi.
8036960	8040460	Tell Iguana Girl I'd like to go see another D-Box movie with her at some point and have
8040460	8041460	Pink Bird.
8041460	8042460	Okay.
8042460	8043460	All right.
8043460	8044460	One more thing?
8044460	8045460	Yes?
8045460	8046460	Yeah.
8046460	8047460	You hung up.
8047460	8048460	Ass.
8048460	8049460	Dude.
8049460	8050460	You ass.
8050460	8051460	They have Ninja Legos now.
8051460	8052460	Place your vote, by the way.
8052460	8053460	Right now.
8053460	8054460	Send your number one and your number two choices.
8054460	8058160	You have until the end of the mailbag segment to get those votes in, and I'll tell you a
8058160	8059160	spoiler.
8059160	8062120	There's not a lot of emails tonight, so hurry, hurry, hurry.
8062120	8063640	But let's see what is in the email bag.
8063640	8069040	We're going to open it up right now, folks.
8069040	8072820	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send us your emails every week.
8072820	8074280	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
8074280	8077120	Dark Soccer is going to jump in the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite
8077120	8078120	emails for you all.
8078120	8079540	How about the one email we got?
8079540	8080540	One email?
8080540	8081540	Holy shit.
8081540	8082540	It's a big in, though.
8082540	8083540	You better get those votes in now.
8083540	8089360	Well, it actually is from Rababa, picking apart an Ars Technica story about Nintendo
8089360	8092240	warning about the 3D for young gamers.
8092240	8094800	So I'm going to read the email as is.
8094800	8099880	First they claim that eye growth as literally translated may be harmed according to a warning
8099880	8101480	statement for the 3DS.
8101480	8105400	They state that it isn't about actual growth, but rather perception.
8105400	8111300	The concern is that the portions of our visual system that reside in the brain are adaptive.
8111300	8115120	They adjust to information we receive and can remap connections in order to operate
8115120	8117320	more efficiently on a typical input.
8117320	8121280	This is especially true in infants as the visual system is still developing at the earliest
8121280	8122280	stages of life.
8122280	8123280	Which is true.
8123280	8129120	Babies can't see much of anything for the first few weeks, except blurs.
8129120	8133920	This ability to rewire our visual system on the fly is behind the 3D health concerns.
8133920	8139040	I actually don't know if what they state is true, but it does seem made up to me.
8139040	8142520	I wish it said according to this article in the Lancet or the like.
8142520	8143520	I wish it...
8143520	8147560	And I find it odd that they forget about the common eye disorder, lazy eye, where muscles
8147560	8151040	in one eye don't grow, causing a seemingly cross eye.
8151040	8155360	This treatment is remarkably simple, wearing an eye patch to exercise the weaker eye.
8155360	8158760	I always assumed the warning was for conditions like lazy eye.
8158760	8159760	What do you think?
8159760	8164960	Also, isn't the warning more about what we don't know about simulated 3D effects?
8164960	8168600	I'm sure that there will also be warnings to stop using 3D if you develop nausea or
8168600	8169600	headache.
8169600	8172320	Either way, it must be better than the red-blue 3D.
8172320	8173640	Later, Ra-ba-ba.
8173640	8177440	Sigh and magenta.
8177440	8181080	You know, and I think we got into this a little bit last week on the show with the disclaimer,
8181080	8185320	but you know, I think it's just Nintendo kind of overcompensating a little bit, where it's
8185320	8188600	just that we live in a soo-happy society.
8188600	8189600	They're covering their ass.
8189600	8194640	Yeah, and I think a kid would have to play these games for a very long time.
8194640	8199200	But I'll admit, when I was playing the 3DS, I did feel that little pull on my eyes.
8199200	8202320	But you know, when it got to me, I just would turn the slider off.
8202320	8206240	So it's really about just kind of knowing your limits, I suppose, and knowing when to
8206240	8207240	turn that off.
8207240	8210920	Now, I guess a child wouldn't really know their limits, but that's why parents have
8210920	8215080	to supervise you guys.
8215080	8219120	So I don't know, I don't know what else to say on that.
8219120	8220120	Anything else for that email?
8220120	8221120	DarkSagra?
8221120	8222120	Nope.
8222120	8223120	Wow.
8223120	8224120	Alright.
8224120	8225120	I'm still tallying cage match votes.
8225120	8226120	Well...
8226120	8227120	Listless votes?
8227120	8228720	Sorry, that's what I meant.
8228720	8229720	Listless votes.
8229720	8230720	Cage matches for after.
8230720	8231720	Yeah, sorry.
8231720	8232720	My bad.
8232720	8233720	Listless votes.
8233720	8234720	I'm still tabulating right now.
8234720	8237440	And two of these have very similar names that I keep mistaking.
8237440	8241120	See, I just gave one a vote that I shouldn't have, because it was a vote for Death Race,
8241120	8242120	not Dead Rising.
8242120	8243120	Dead!
8243120	8244120	Alright.
8244120	8247440	This is the very, very last call.
8247440	8250520	If you don't get those votes in now, they may not count, because we have to move into
8250520	8252140	the FUs of the week.
8252140	8257280	It's the part of the show where we get angsty.
8257280	8272840	FU to my hip.
8272840	8276640	For hurting like a motherfucker all week.
8276640	8278440	And keeping me from doing fun things.
8278440	8284080	However, I have leveled quite a bit in World of Warcraft, and FU did that too.
8284080	8285080	Loki?
8285080	8287080	Um, FU to my shoulder.
8287080	8291640	I must have slept on it weird or something last night, because it's been hurting the
8291640	8295020	hell out of me today, so that really sucks.
8295020	8298160	Are you sure that your child hasn't learned how to climb out of the crib and come chew
8298160	8299160	on your shoulder?
8299160	8300160	No.
8300160	8302240	He tried to eat my nose last night, though, so it's possible.
8302240	8303240	All babies are always sticking things in their mouths.
8303240	8306360	I don't know if you saw the picture on Facebook Nellie posted.
8306360	8307360	That picture was great.
8307360	8312020	It was like some de- he just like all of a sudden started attacking my nose, it was funny.
8312020	8313020	It's something!
8313020	8314020	Bite!
8314020	8316640	These babies are cute.
8316640	8320280	Until they get three and decide to jump on you and break your back.
8320280	8322160	And then they're still cute.
8322160	8329800	Yeah, the way that I hurt my hip is catching Becky's son Julian, because now he's falling
8329800	8332360	with style on top of people.
8332360	8337560	Like in Toy Story, anyway.
8337560	8343660	All right, my FU of the week goes to, um, people that are always negative all the time.
8343660	8347160	People that just live in this negative little world with their negative little comments,
8347160	8349320	they never have anything good to say.
8349320	8352320	Geez, Rob, you're complaining a lot.
8352320	8353320	Shut up!
8353320	8354320	That was negative, too!
8354320	8355320	No, but I'm serious.
8355320	8360760	It's like, I just say there's, there's certain fun things that I like to do and the amount
8360760	8363660	of negativity surrounding them is starting to suck the fun out of it.
8363660	8364660	And it really is.
8364660	8367140	It's nothing any of you are involved with, don't worry about it.
8367140	8370900	So it's kind of one of those things where I'm like starting to get to my wits end and
8370900	8374980	it's kind of like I, I might have to give it up because it's not fun anymore.
8374980	8375980	I get it.
8375980	8376980	It's a bummer.
8376980	8377980	It's nothing to do with podcasting, y'all.
8377980	8378980	Don't start rumors.
8378980	8379980	Or Warcraft.
8379980	8380980	So it's just frustrating.
8380980	8381980	Yeah.
8381980	8382980	Anyhow, drama.
8382980	8390420	There's always drama somewheres, but let's, let's make things a little bit happier and
8390420	8393460	get into the listless results.
8393460	8394460	Yay!
8394460	8396460	Results of tonight's listless.
8396460	8397540	This is it.
8397540	8398800	This is the definitive list.
8398800	8402060	You guys, Oh, we've got a late vote.
8402060	8403820	I almost would not let this count.
8403820	8406460	However, I don't think it's going to change the final result here.
8406460	8408020	No, it does not.
8408020	8409020	All right.
8409020	8410580	The top three, and this is it guys.
8410580	8411800	There is no disputing.
8411800	8415660	These are the three games you want to see them make out of toys.
8415660	8418060	Number three tonight, and it was a close one.
8418060	8421180	Number three tonight was death race.
8421180	8422180	My little pony.
8422180	8423180	Yay.
8423180	8427860	We want those ponies to fight to the death.
8427860	8434780	Your number two pick for game you most want to see them make out of an old toy, Crossfire.
8434780	8435780	That's going to be interesting.
8435780	8436780	I don't know how that would be a video game.
8436780	8437780	You should find the commercial for Crossfire, Rob.
8437780	8439580	Didn't it have like a catchy little theme song to it?
8439580	8440580	I think it did.
8440580	8441580	Hold on.
8441580	8442580	Let me put that in and chat.
8442580	8443580	Let me see if I can YouTube it real quick.
8443580	8444580	Here.
8444580	8445580	Hold on.
8445580	8454340	It was retarded and funny at the same time and it like had this like red and blue background.
8454340	8455340	Hold on.
8455340	8456340	Hold on kids.
8456340	8457340	Here we go.
8457340	8458340	Coming soon to a video game store near you.
8458340	8487100	The ultimate challenge, Crossfire.
8487100	8488660	I found one of those at a thrift store.
8488660	8489860	God, the eighties were amazing.
8489860	8492220	Rob, with the label on it, missing balls.
8492220	8495140	It was like a year ago.
8495140	8496620	This game has no balls.
8496620	8497780	All right.
8497780	8503140	And the number one game or sorry, number one toy you most want to see turned into a game.
8503140	8504140	Come on.
8504140	8505140	You guys know our audience.
8505140	8506140	What is it?
8506140	8508140	Light, bright DDR.
8508140	8509140	Yay.
8509140	8513420	Everyone get out the E in the sandstorm.
8513420	8514980	Everyone rave.
8514980	8515980	Coming soon.
8515980	8516980	Hugs.
8516980	8517980	Everybody hugs.
8517980	8518980	Hugs.
8518980	8521900	I made some candy cause you're my friend.
8521900	8524380	You guys let's hug.
8524380	8527060	Can we cuddle?
8527060	8528580	And then there's the make out room.
8528580	8531660	No, it's the, it's the cuddle room.
8531660	8532660	It's not the make out room.
8532660	8534100	Oh, you know, that's what it's going to turn into.
8534100	8537640	Did you ever go to like, I want to say you went to one, like I still remember we both
8537640	8538640	went to one or something.
8538640	8546820	No, I went to a roller skate rave and really, well we got permission to.
8546820	8552900	We rented, this is in Alabama, mind you, we rented a roller rink and my roommate at the
8552900	8560280	time DJ'd the whole thing and it was like, like the, the dance music of that day, like
8560280	8565500	Psychosonic and Tracy Lords and Moby and all of that cause you know Tracy Lords did her
8565500	8566500	stint as a DJ.
8566500	8567500	I love Tracy Lords.
8567500	8568500	I'm not even going to lie.
8568500	8569500	Oh yeah.
8569500	8578020	Um, you know, and a sunscreen and all of those, you know, uh, mid nineties dance music and
8578020	8583380	there was activities going on in the outside cause we couldn't do anything inside the rink.
8583380	8589460	Sorry, we needed a soundtrack to this, but we had people in various states of intoxication
8589460	8591540	on roller skates.
8591540	8592540	It was amazing.
8592540	8595300	Loki, did you ever go to a rave when you were younger?
8595300	8602180	Um, no, but I had to clean up a rave and that's not, not much fun.
8602180	8612660	Apparently they, they got the good idea to, um, host a rave at the Cuzar and most people,
8612660	8621420	I guess there was an orgy on the T-MEC machine and there was also an orgy on the, uh, hard
8621420	8623740	driving machine, I think.
8623740	8625500	The nap machine.
8625500	8630020	Anyways so they had that, but people started having an orgy in the hard drive and I don't
8630020	8631020	know.
8631020	8632020	I wasn't there.
8632020	8636220	Um, but anyways, see people were paying money to go inside the arena.
8636220	8638540	They weren't even really playing laser tag.
8638540	8641900	They were just staring at the colors from all the black lights.
8641900	8646860	So uh, yeah, I missed out on that unfortunately, but I got to come in and clean it up afterwards
8646860	8647860	and that sucked.
8647860	8648860	How exciting for you.
8648860	8650600	I went to, I went to two raves.
8650600	8653380	I had a really good friend of mine when I was younger was really into the whole rave
8653380	8656340	thing and one of them was kind of dumb.
8656340	8657660	Like I didn't have a good time at that rave.
8657660	8661580	It was, it was like a house that was like a recording studio that whatever.
8661580	8665540	Keep in mind y'all, I went to school in Chico, California, which is like party central.
8665540	8668100	Like everything you've read about, about Chico being a party school.
8668100	8669100	Totally true.
8669100	8674620	So uh, yeah, so that rave was kind of dopey, but the other one was like an outdoor kind
8674620	8675620	of thing.
8675620	8678740	I don't even know where it was cause I wasn't watching where we were driving and I had a
8678740	8679740	lot of fun.
8679740	8680740	I have to, I'm not going to lie.
8680740	8684300	I had a lot, you know, for being like the E for being 20 I didn't do any of that.
8684300	8688660	And actually everybody really respected my wishes to not get into doing to any of that.
8688660	8690260	But um, I'm not going to lie.
8690260	8694780	Um, there was this guy who I think might've had some of the substances was really hot
8694780	8695940	and we just made out all night.
8695940	8699420	Like I didn't, I didn't need nothing to get me in the mood.
8699420	8700420	I'm like, you're hot.
8700420	8702260	That's drug enough for me.
8702260	8704460	Oh Rob.
8704460	8705460	So that was the day.
8705460	8708500	And then actually I kissed a girl at that same wave.
8708500	8710580	I know because she's okay.
8710580	8712420	This has nothing to do with games, but I don't even care.
8712420	8713740	This is funny.
8713740	8719200	She took this book or she had this book of everybody she'd ever made out with was in
8719200	8720620	this book.
8720620	8726560	And uh, she was on page 67 and I said, I want to be page 69 in your book.
8726560	8728260	Like I have to like, this is my new goal.
8728260	8730100	I want to be page 69 in your book.
8730100	8733540	And she's like, well, I'll make out with you, but I have to have 68 first.
8733540	8736500	So I was like, you make out with her.
8736500	8741260	And so she made out with this random guy and then made out with me.
8741260	8745380	And then, uh, I was number 69 and then this is so terrible.
8745380	8747080	You guys don't do this at home.
8747080	8752000	Then we decided we were all three going to kiss and that's when I got introduced to three
8752000	8753820	way kissing, which is really weird.
8753820	8763720	Yeah, it's, it's, there's certain things I can't say with my husband and the other.
8763720	8767220	So that was my, um, raving experience.
8767220	8772180	So it was a good time, you know, I've, I've just done the wrong and silly and you know
8772180	8773180	what it was.
8773180	8774180	It wasn't sex.
8774180	8775180	It was just kissing.
8775180	8776180	I've done the roller rave.
8776180	8777180	Yeah.
8777180	8782780	The roller rave was fun cause I drank a lot of beer and I can roller skate drunk.
8782780	8785780	Alrighty, let's move on.
8785780	8788660	Do not drink and roller skate.
8788660	8790940	It is a bigger disaster than drinking and driving.
8790940	8794340	Let's try to get back into some actual video game news.
8794340	8795340	I don't know.
8795340	8796740	Unless Loki wants to talk about three way kissing.
8796740	8800300	I don't know, but I have no experience in that I'm afraid.
8800300	8802300	Well then I guess we'll have to go back to video game news.
8802300	8809380	I guess we're going to have to, um, so there was concern with, uh, harmonics being sold
8809380	8814860	by, uh, MTV, you know, who was going to buy them, you know, was it going to be Activision?
8814860	8819860	God, let's hope it's not Activision, but, uh, ironically enough, no one ever thought
8819860	8823900	harmonics may buy harmonics and that's what happened.
8823900	8830940	Um, apparently our harmonics, um, they've been purchased and they have a investment
8830940	8831940	group.
8831940	8834940	Uh, Columbus Nova also, um, took part in that.
8834940	8839860	They purchased them for $49 and 99 cents plus whatever debt they had.
8839860	8848700	So, um, apparently they're going to, um, you know, take on their debts and stuff.
8848700	8855420	But, uh, harmonics will assume, uh, responsibility over its liabilities and also, um, includes,
8855420	8860900	um, music rights, fees, and responsibilities for lots of unsold games and equipment sitting
8860900	8862420	on warehouse shelves.
8862420	8869100	Also, they're going to be able to, um, keep the rights to Rock Band and Dent Central.
8869100	8871820	And, um, we'll have control over those franchises.
8871820	8874020	So that's kind of cool.
8874020	8876140	And Viacom's not doing too bad out of it.
8876140	8882020	Apparently the sale will reportedly net Viacom $150 million in tax benefits and, uh, you
8882020	8885820	know, considering it spent $175 million to buy the company in the first place, that's
8885820	8886820	not bad.
8886820	8887820	Wow.
8887820	8892940	So they're going to, uh, write off essentially on their taxes this year, Viacom, or I mean,
8892940	8893940	I, uh, harmonics.
8893940	8895740	Viacom will write them off.
8895740	8896740	Wow.
8896740	8897740	Crazy.
8897740	8902620	I just hope that they can get the backing that they'll need to keep up, uh, with, you
8902620	8904700	know, production and licensing and everything.
8904700	8909700	Where's the commercial on YouTube that's all QVC style where you can buy a video game publishing
8909700	8915000	company for $49.99 and the chicks who have no idea what they're talking about trying
8915000	8916000	to explain it.
8916000	8919160	Have you ever watched them sell video games on QVC?
8919160	8920340	It makes my brain hurt.
8920340	8921860	It's so awesomely bad.
8921860	8923380	I don't watch TV, Rob.
8923380	8924380	Oh my God.
8924380	8925380	That should be a segment on our show.
8925380	8926380	I just watch Supernatural.
8926380	8927720	We're hard up for new segments on our show.
8927720	8933080	We need to start doing like QVC selling video games because it's, it's hilarious how bad
8933080	8934180	they are.
8934180	8940180	This game is called Shock Troopers and I think it's about getting electrocuted in the jungle
8940180	8942300	while you're shooting guns.
8942300	8943300	Yeah.
8943300	8947700	This is a really fun game for the whole family.
8947700	8949900	And this game is called Resident Evil.
8949900	8951260	It's not bloody at all.
8951260	8952660	There's no zombies.
8952660	8956260	For you auto aficionados out here, Grand Theft Auto is perfect for you.
8956260	8959340	It has lots of cars in it and hookers.
8959340	8962900	I want to see really quick.
8962900	8964260	Do they have any on YouTube?
8964260	8965260	Hold on.
8965260	8967340	You know they've got everything on YouTube, Rob.
8967340	8969620	You're not going to have a problem.
8969620	8972020	Although if you don't find anything, I will be surprised.
8972020	8976660	And there was the one, the guy who broke the TV with the Wiimote on QVC.
8976660	8977660	Really?
8977660	8980660	That was pretty funny.
8980660	8985300	Um, QVC Phineas and Ferb motion video game.
8985300	8988500	Phineas and Ferb is awesome.
8988500	8992340	I don't, this isn't actually a clip from QVC though.
8992340	8993340	I don't know.
8993340	8994340	Sadly I don't.
8994340	8995340	Good chat room.
8995340	8996340	You need to find me one so I can play it here on the show.
8996340	8997340	Okay.
8997340	8998340	We got one more story for you guys.
8998340	9003620	Then we're going to open up the, uh, uh, 877 number 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype
9003620	9004620	is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9004620	9010820	Ooh, actually I need to make sure that, uh, the 800 number is still working because, uh,
9010820	9013740	it actually may have ran out tonight and I forgot to recharge it.
9013740	9016700	So you may only be able to get us on Skype tonight at OrangeLoungeRadio, but I'll try
9016700	9017700	in a minute here.
9017700	9022060	Uh, first off though, we've got to get to news about the new Silent Hill.
9022060	9026160	There's a new Silent Hill game coming and it's called, not Silent Hill 8, it's called
9026160	9028100	Silent Hill Downpour.
9028100	9029260	Yep.
9029260	9032100	That's the new name of the game, Silent Hill Downpour.
9032100	9035360	There's new information about this game in the latest Game Informer.
9035360	9039100	Apparently the town is huge and you're going to use a subway system to get from one parts
9039100	9040460	of the town to another.
9040460	9044500	There's going to be a never before seen Southeastern side of Silent Hill.
9044500	9047180	There is no hospitals or schools in that area.
9047180	9048180	Hmm.
9048180	9049180	So they're trying something new.
9049180	9052460	Uh, there will be optional side quests apparently in the game as well.
9052460	9056020	Uh, combat will be from more like the earlier Silent Hill games.
9056020	9060340	You can avoid a lot of encounters and it's advised to avoid encounters.
9060340	9063840	You can only carry one melee weapon at a time, such as an axe.
9063840	9066780	The enemies are very hard to kill, the weapons break easily.
9066780	9071300	The only fights you have to do in the game are boss battles.
9071300	9073380	Water is going to be an essential part of the game.
9073380	9077260	Uh, there's apparently a room in the game that has upside down running water on the
9077260	9078260	ceiling.
9078260	9082580	Uh, puzzles will be back to scaling difficulty levels so you can have easy puzzles or super
9082580	9083740	hard puzzles.
9083740	9086540	So that's kind of cool because it sounds like they're going back to their roots a little
9086540	9087540	bit.
9087540	9091580	But it sounds like they're mixing a little bit of old Silent Hill with open world quest
9091580	9095600	driven games like, I don't know, Warcraft, Borderlands, that type of thing.
9095600	9098420	So that's, um, kind of neat, I got to say.
9098420	9100920	So, uh, looking forward to trying that.
9100920	9101920	Hopefully that'll be at E3.
9101920	9106060	Are you excited for that game at all, Dark Sakura?
9106060	9111980	I was looking at the stuff for it, and I think that it's got some interesting stuff to it,
9111980	9112980	so I might play it.
9112980	9117980	But if it's anything at all like, um, whatever the Shattered Memories was, then no.
9117980	9121860	Act Definite on our chatroom says Silent Hill Downhill, more like it.
9121860	9123500	Wham wham wham wham.
9123500	9128740	So is that like the last game except they're replacing the snow with lots of rain?
9128740	9132260	I would have to give it a try.
9132260	9133260	I would have to give it a chance.
9133260	9136180	I'd have to give the other ones a chance, I'd have to give this a chance.
9136180	9139380	Because I mean, Silent Hill, you know.
9139380	9144740	DDR Dollar Bill says Silent Hill Signs Edition.
9144740	9149980	I do like the idea of having the open universe.
9149980	9150980	So maybe.
9150980	9151980	Me too.
9151980	9154060	Maybe that will be the redeeming factor.
9154060	9156380	Who knows.
9156380	9158380	What do you most want to see in a new Silent Hill game?
9158380	9160660	Do you think they ought to just go back to Silent Hill 2?
9160660	9163980	I want to see it produced by Konami in Japan.
9163980	9166780	That's what I most want to see.
9166780	9172580	That's what it needs, is to be back, they need to beg Yamaoka to come back, and they
9172580	9176160	need to just get it back done the way they were doing them before.
9176160	9177540	They were doing them well.
9177540	9179420	Why did they screw up?
9179420	9182060	They shouldn't have ever sent the franchise to the US.
9182060	9184060	I mean as far as to be developed in the US.
9184060	9185380	That's what I'm saying.
9185380	9187660	It doesn't have the same feel anymore.
9187660	9189160	Alright.
9189160	9194380	We are going to open up the Skype line right now at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9194380	9197920	It does look like the number is working, but the message I think is broken.
9197920	9201160	So if you call, you're not going to get that little, you've reached Orange Lounge Radio
9201160	9202160	message line.
9202160	9204300	I don't, it's some generic thing right now.
9204300	9206500	So we'll look at that after the show, why that's going on.
9206500	9210660	But otherwise, you can give us a call right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or of course our username
9210660	9212120	on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9212120	9215960	Now there is a bit of delay between live and when the folks can actually start calling,
9215960	9218500	so I'll ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories.
9218500	9223660	Yes, there's some new stuff developing on the 3D side of the PlayStation Network.
9223660	9229500	Apparently they're going to start offering some 3D movies available on their service.
9229500	9238780	And one of those 3D movies is, yes, the 3D swimsuit video via, I believe, Sports Illustrated.
9238780	9243260	So you will be able to get 3D boobs on the PlayStation 3.
9243260	9246140	Not quite porn, but hey, whatever.
9246140	9248180	It's Cinemax style porn.
9248180	9249540	Yes.
9249540	9251780	And then, I don't know if you've seen this yet, Rob.
9251780	9254340	This is kind of scary.
9254340	9261020	Another Kinect hack, some guy has actually programmed the Kinect to allow him to play
9261020	9268660	around with the figure of Ivy from Soul Calibur with boob physics.
9268660	9273500	Well, lack of boob physics, but, you know, Soul Calibur boob physics.
9273500	9277300	So he can move around with her boobs bouncing around.
9277300	9278300	Gay boob simulations.
9278300	9280660	All right, we got a call coming in, so let's go to that real quick.
9280660	9281900	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9281900	9282900	Who's this?
9282900	9283900	Hi.
9283900	9284900	It's DDR Dollar Bill.
9284900	9285900	DDR Dollar Bill.
9285900	9286900	How are you doing, my friend?
9286900	9287900	Yeah, I'm doing all right, man.
9287900	9288900	Doing all right.
9288900	9289900	All right.
9289900	9290900	What's on your mind?
9290900	9296020	Pretty much, I was trying to send an email out to you guys, but I was trying to do it
9296020	9298220	with the website, but I kept getting rejected.
9298220	9300620	So I figured, let me just call up and explain what's going on.
9300620	9301620	Weird.
9301620	9302620	I don't know why the website's rejecting.
9302620	9305100	But, you know, the website had some major issues last week.
9305100	9307580	I guess some people started spamming our photo feed.
9307580	9308580	I missed it.
9308580	9309580	I totally missed this.
9309580	9313220	Like, actdeft and dekeman took care of it when I wasn't listening, or watching, I should
9313220	9314220	say.
9314220	9318180	But I guess, like, people were putting, like, weird, like, porno things in the picture feed.
9318180	9322420	And you know, I threatened to pull the plug before if that shit starts happening.
9322420	9326140	However, I realize there's no one that actually listens to this show's fault, but we have
9326140	9327220	to keep an eye on that now.
9327220	9330100	So some of the things with the website might have got tweaked because of that.
9330100	9331700	Anyhow, what's on your mind?
9331700	9336660	Um, pretty much, this is probably going to be the year that I'm going to really just
9336660	9337660	stop gaming.
9337660	9338660	Video gaming.
9338660	9339660	What?
9339660	9340660	Why is that?
9340660	9344740	Well, the other day, a couple days ago, I was going to, I was just listening to some
9344740	9349620	old Nintendo games, like some music, you know, the NSF files, the emulators.
9349620	9353020	And I was just going back, like, what are some of the best things I remember about games?
9353020	9358860	And quite honestly, today's games don't have any excitement to it.
9358860	9363780	There's, there's nothing really exciting about playing them anymore.
9363780	9366300	There's no games that get you excited anymore?
9366300	9367620	What type, okay, let me ask you this.
9367620	9369780	What type of old Nintendo games did you like?
9369780	9372660	Ah, some memories, let's see.
9372660	9377060	I actually loved the original Ninja Gaiden, for example, the trilogy.
9377060	9378060	Okay.
9378060	9382900	I loved that, um, Blaster Master was another popular one.
9382900	9386700	I agree, that new Blaster Master game they made a little while ago wasn't nearly as good
9386700	9387700	as the old one.
9387700	9388700	Really unfortunate.
9388700	9391260	Ooh, I haven't tried that yet.
9391260	9394100	But yeah, like, um, and what was another one I tried?
9394100	9400260	I mean, I can go to Genesis games, like, Phantasy Star 2, for example, it was just, those, those
9400260	9403740	things that have, you know, they gave me great memories, you know, they made me want to play
9403740	9408820	it through, no matter how bullshit hard it got, you know, they were just fantastic, like,
9408820	9409820	those games.
9409820	9415300	And recently, no game really has actually grabbed my attention.
9415300	9421260	Maybe just one, but one out of, how many games get released a year, that's a bad number.
9421260	9424340	Out of curiosity, what's the one game that grabbed your attention?
9424340	9425340	Red Dead Redemption.
9425340	9427820	Okay, well that was a pretty solid game.
9427820	9428820	Interesting.
9428820	9432660	And you know what, you seem to really like exploring in games, because a lot of those
9432660	9436260	games you name, they all have to do something like you explore, and you find new things
9436260	9440820	as you go through the world, especially something like Red Dead Redemption is, is a lot about,
9440820	9441820	like, exploration.
9441820	9444740	So it sounds like these kind of, like, open world games might kind of be your thing, I
9444740	9446740	don't know, I'm just kind of guessing.
9446740	9451980	But what about, like, new games that kind of call back that retro style, and I mean
9451980	9455720	things like Bionic Commando Rearmed, we talked about earlier in the show, has a new release
9455720	9456720	coming out.
9456720	9459940	Super Meat Boy, awesome throwback to retro games.
9459940	9460940	No interest there?
9460940	9465140	Oh, okay, from, okay, for Bionic Commando Rearmed, I loved that.
9465140	9469940	I, it's like, that event, I eventually beat it, and it was like, it was a satisfying experience.
9469940	9471660	I really loved it.
9471660	9476780	Especially since I loved Bionic Commando since the Arcade Edition, which most people are
9476780	9480420	going to be like, there was an arcade?
9480420	9485620	I seem to recall one, I do, and not even just the Pay Choice 10 one, I think there was actually
9485620	9488340	like a, I seem to recall what you're talking about.
9488340	9490340	Yeah, like that one.
9490340	9495660	Super Meat Boy is actually very, very interesting case.
9495660	9502540	It's, I tried a demo of it, and I liked it, but at the same time, my thoughts were, do
9502540	9507580	I really want to go through the harder levels for reward that I'm not going to really enjoy?
9507580	9512340	I mean, you know, it's like, am I going to play this difficult game for the sake of it
9512340	9516980	being difficult, or am I going to play it because I actually enjoy it?
9516980	9520620	You know, I see a comment in our chat room, and I think this is a darn good piece of advice
9520620	9525600	for you, and Azam in our chat room says, someone get this man a near lethal dose of indie gaming
9525600	9526820	stat.
9526820	9529900	Maybe you're just fed up with what's in the mainstream in a lot of those games that, you
9529900	9532620	know, cost $60 to find out a game sucks.
9532620	9535940	Have you thought about turning to the indie side of things a little bit, maybe exploring
9535940	9539460	a little more what Steam or the Xbox Live indie arcades have on it?
9539460	9542100	Ah, that's another good point you guys bring up.
9542100	9545460	You are, that's another point I was going to bring up because, yes, I've actually turned
9545460	9549860	to indie gaming, and I can tell you one other game that actually really caught my interest,
9549860	9552580	and I didn't really mention this, and again, I'm remembering.
9552580	9554260	Amnesia, have you ever heard of it?
9554260	9555260	Yes, I have.
9555260	9557260	I have heard of Amnesia.
9557260	9559140	Scariest fucking game I ever played in my life.
9559140	9560340	Yeah, I hear it's great.
9560340	9563500	I haven't played it myself yet, but I hear it's really scary.
9563500	9566620	So yeah, I mean, that's a great indie game.
9566620	9571100	I've heard, we've heard a lot, we had somebody on the show last week talking about VVVVV
9571100	9572660	being their game of the year.
9572660	9576820	I mean, Super Meat Boy of sorts is an indie game as well.
9576820	9579580	There's a lot of these indie packs that are available on Steam.
9579580	9583740	I don't know, you know, it's not as cheap now as they were at Christmas time, but things
9583740	9587300	where you can get like, you know, kind of like a sampling of different types of games.
9587300	9588300	Pretty cheap.
9588300	9590420	The Humble Indie Bundle was out recently.
9590420	9595020	You know, maybe there's more to look for in there, where you don't feel like you're getting
9595020	9598060	as shafted with the money you're spending.
9598060	9601060	Especially when it's like you can't replay much demos these days.
9601060	9602060	Absolutely.
9602060	9603060	You know.
9603060	9607600	Well, DDR Dollar Bill, I hope you find something to kind of change your mind a little bit.
9607600	9611660	You know, there's so many types of games out there, but maybe it's just not gonna be a
9611660	9615300	AAA game from the developer, but at the same time, you liked Red Dead Redemption.
9615300	9620840	So I wouldn't look away completely from what the mainstream's doing, because they'll be
9620840	9623260	more like Red Dead soon, trust me.
9623260	9627860	Yeah, I guess it's just the start of the year, so I'll give it a chance.
9627860	9628860	That's true.
9628860	9629860	I think it'll be okay.
9629860	9631940	Alright, DDR Dollar Bill, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, but thanks for
9631940	9632940	giving us a call.
9632940	9633940	Good topic.
9633940	9634940	No problem.
9634940	9635940	Alright, take care, guys.
9635940	9636940	Later, guys.
9636940	9637940	Later.
9637940	9638940	Alright, good call.
9638940	9639940	Let's go to another one.
9639940	9640940	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.
9640940	9641940	What's up, guys?
9641940	9642940	This is Taijudo.
9642940	9643940	Taijudo.
9643940	9644940	What's on your mind, buddy?
9644940	9645940	No, no.
9645940	9651660	Just before I go into it, I wanna talk about, I just wanted to recommend a game.
9651660	9655260	Well, not actually a game, but what you guys were doing earlier, where you're combining
9655260	9656260	toys and games.
9656260	9657260	Yeah, yeah.
9657260	9658260	What's that?
9658260	9663260	How about a chase in the real warriors with the burnout engine?
9663260	9666060	Dude, sweet!
9666060	9667060	I like that.
9667060	9672380	And I'm kinda surprised we didn't get something in that whole racing game theme, because there
9672380	9674020	was so much good racing stuff.
9674020	9678260	You know, I did consider for a moment a Power Wheels racing game.
9678260	9679260	I did.
9679260	9682460	That thought did cross my mind, but I like your idea a lot, so.
9682460	9683700	Yeah, don't forget about Mask.
9683700	9684700	That was also great.
9684700	9687980	I don't know about the cartoon, but the toys were great.
9687980	9692620	But onto what I was gonna talk about, I don't know if there's still any people out there
9692620	9697460	that were interested in the agency MMO that was supposed to come out like eons ago.
9697460	9698460	Yeah, whatever happened to that?
9698460	9699460	You guys remember this game?
9699460	9700460	You've been following this?
9700460	9703020	It's supposed to still, supposedly it's still in development.
9703020	9704020	I mean, I doubt that.
9704020	9708620	I mean, it's been a long time since you've heard anything from it, but according to a
9708620	9713260	lot of sources, they're all saying that the game's still coming out on PlayStation 3 and
9713260	9716180	the PC, supposedly the PC before the PS3.
9716180	9721200	But I don't know, that's kinda shaky, but I do have some good news for people who may
9721200	9722780	be still interested in that game.
9722780	9723780	What's up?
9723780	9728740	There's a Facebook app made by the developers of that game that you can actually play now.
9728740	9732860	It's kinda like Mafia Wars, you know, the whole text-based type deal.
9732860	9733860	But it's a lot of fun.
9733860	9737460	The presentation is really great, and I'm enjoying it.
9737460	9738780	Awesome.
9738780	9744060	So have they nailed a release window for this yet, or does it need to go through the extensive
9744060	9746520	testing first?
9746520	9747520	That I don't know.
9747520	9749460	I mean, you guys can look that up.
9749460	9752700	As far as I know, they're reworking the game.
9752700	9758240	They weren't satisfied with what they originally had, the stuff that they were showing at E3,
9758240	9762660	and they're supposedly, like, rebuilding a whole other type of game, because for whatever
9762660	9765540	their reasons are, they weren't happy with it.
9765540	9769460	You know what, that's okay to go back and retool it, because I don't want them to release
9769460	9770460	a bunch of crap.
9770460	9773100	Because look at what happened with Final Fantasy XIV.
9773100	9777740	They didn't really test that thoroughly enough, and when they released it, it ended up being
9777740	9783740	kind of hit with a thud, and now they're going to have to rework the game while it's out,
9783740	9787460	and now it's kind of done, you know what I mean?
9787460	9791500	So I just hope they didn't take out the feature where there was supposed to be some feature
9791500	9796580	where you could actually play the game through your cell phone, like you're supposed to take
9796580	9802340	on these little, I guess you would call them micro-agents, and they were supposed to build
9802340	9805620	cards and gadgets for you, and you were supposed to be able to manage that through your cell
9805620	9806620	phone somehow.
9806620	9807860	And I thought that was a great idea.
9807860	9812020	I like the fact that they were taking MMO in another direction, so hopefully they're
9812020	9816540	not coming out with just something like APB where you're just running and gunning, and
9816540	9818500	it'll hold a lot of BS.
9818500	9822620	I really like that idea of kind of like interacting with the cell phones more and other types
9822620	9824140	of things like that.
9824140	9827020	I think that's a really kind of good use of...
9827020	9828020	Whoa!
9828020	9829020	Ah!
9829020	9830020	Sorry about that.
9830020	9831180	Somebody sent me a YouTube link.
9831180	9836740	I brought it up a little soon.
9836740	9839620	Sorry.
9839620	9840620	That totally threw me.
9840620	9841620	Way to go!
9841620	9842620	You're dead here.
9842620	9843620	I know, gosh.
9843620	9844620	All right, sorry about that.
9844620	9847020	But that's kind of the way games like Warcraft and so forth are going, where they're fully
9847020	9851660	interactive with all these different types of platforms, like the mobile phones and everything.
9851660	9854580	Yeah, I think that's the way to go.
9854580	9857780	Like I said, I don't know if you remember what I called last week, and I'm all about
9857780	9863540	game innovation, and I kind of agree with your previous caller that games need to be
9863540	9864540	a little more innovative.
9864540	9868420	I mean, I'm not going to quit gaming anytime soon, but they do need to come out with something
9868420	9872340	more than just Call of Duty and all the other bullshit that they're coming out with.
9872340	9873340	I want something...
9873340	9876280	I want them to really take advantage of what we have now.
9876280	9877860	We have like motion control crap.
9877860	9878860	We have HD crap.
9878860	9881500	I mean, there's just so much that they can do with it.
9881500	9886620	I mean, I know that it's a whole money management thing, and there's a memory thing, and there's
9886620	9889740	a lot of balancing things that you have to do with the games, but I know that they can
9889740	9892140	do a lot better than what they're doing now.
9892140	9893140	They can at least try.
9893140	9894140	It's just BS that's coming up.
9894140	9895140	Alright.
9895140	9898060	Well, we'll be keeping an eye on this game.
9898060	9901780	It does appear that they're still targeting the second half of 2011 for this, but it'll
9901780	9903940	be done when it's done, darn it.
9903940	9910020	Yeah, and oh, that name of the app is the Agency Covert Ops.
9910020	9911020	Look for that on Facebook.
9911020	9912020	That's the name of it.
9912020	9914620	That is available on Facebook?
9914620	9918380	And it looks like it's been up since May of last year, missions, minigames, and sharing
9918380	9920980	achievements with Facebook friends.
9920980	9921980	Look at that.
9921980	9922980	Alright, thanks buddy.
9922980	9923980	Thank you so much for the call.
9923980	9924980	Alright, goodnight everyone.
9924980	9925980	Later.
9925980	9931420	Alright, let's go ahead and take one more call here on the Skype line tonight, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
9931420	9933900	or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9933900	9937900	Again, that's 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9937900	9941860	Loki, do you have any more last minute stories for us while we wait for that call?
9941860	9942900	Yeah.
9942900	9945220	There's actually some other cool stuff.
9945220	9947660	Some stuff coming out of CES.
9947660	9951860	They're talking a little bit about Avatar Connect, which is gonna be kind of a new chat
9951860	9957420	method that you can use to actually, you know, chat with people, you know, recognize facial
9957420	9959300	expressions and stuff like that.
9959300	9964000	So kind of mapping your voice to your avatar, which is kind of neat, and that'll be available
9964000	9966500	for gold numbers later this spring.
9966500	9969780	You'll use it once and then the thrill will be over, but I do like the idea like you can
9969780	9971420	like publish it to Facebook and stuff.
9971420	9974340	I'll bet you we're gonna start seeing podcasts recorded like this.
9974340	9977340	We should do an episode of OLR like this, like a bonus episode of OLR.
9977340	9978340	That would be funny.
9978340	9980200	That would be kind of funny.
9980200	9983580	That's like the one thing we have to do and then that'll be it.
9983580	9986580	And the other thing, I don't know if this pissed you off, Rob, they're talking about
9986580	9992060	bringing Game Room to the Windows Phone 7.
9992060	9995540	That wouldn't piss me off unless they're gonna charge us all over again for everything.
9995540	9996540	Probably.
9996540	9998240	Now I'm pissed!
9998240	10004460	And then also they're gonna be adding on to Windows Phone 7 Fable Queen Golf.
10004460	10007540	And I believe they're also bringing in that poker game as well.
10007540	10008540	So.
10008540	10009540	Alright.
10009540	10010540	Interesting.
10010540	10014140	Anything else for last minute stories tonight?
10014140	10018480	Turbografx Games coming to the PlayStation Network.
10018480	10022100	So you can play games that, like Keith Courage, that weren't very good.
10022100	10024060	Yeah, these are from Hudson.
10024060	10025180	Don't get me started.
10025180	10028220	Alien Crush, Bomberman 94, Box Adventure.
10028220	10029220	Some of them were good.
10029220	10030220	Yeah.
10030220	10031220	Some of them were good.
10031220	10036580	Dungeon Explorer, New Adventure Islands, Soldier Blades, Super Star Soldier, Victory Run, World
10036580	10038820	Sports Competition, and Nootopia.
10038820	10041140	Alright, I gotta call waiting, so let's-
10041140	10043540	Nootopia is a great game and it's a lot like Zelda.
10043540	10044540	Let me go to the phones.
10044540	10046060	I think you've done, haven't you done it as a classic game of the week?
10046060	10047320	I think I have done Nootopia.
10047320	10048860	Let me go to the phones, cause I got somebody waiting.
10048860	10050340	Hi, you're on OrangeLawn's Radio, who's this?
10050340	10051340	Hey, this is X-Link.
10051340	10053340	Hey, X-Link, what's on your mind, buddy?
10053340	10054340	Hey, nothing much.
10054340	10059140	You know, sometimes games and stuff, sometimes, I can understand the other color a while back.
10059140	10062700	I mean, there's been times when I step back from playing video games for a while, because
10062700	10063700	you know, you get burned out.
10063700	10067340	You play stuff, you know, you think a lot of stuff comes out, it's the same thing, it's,
10067340	10072940	you know, you know, I take a few days off, maybe read some books, you know, they come
10072940	10074300	back and do something else.
10074300	10080020	But you know, I'm sure there's something out there for a little bit for everyone, and yeah,
10080020	10084220	and as I was telling you earlier, they should make Millie Born into another PC game if they,
10084220	10088100	I mean, I know there was one a long time ago, but I think they should make that into another
10088100	10089100	one.
10089100	10090100	They do need to make another one.
10090100	10096740	I have a indie app on my iTouch that I bought from the store that was 99 cents, that was
10096740	10101900	kind of the card game, but though it's not the official version, but it plays the same
10101900	10104580	way, which is really cool.
10104580	10110780	You know, I like playing all kinds of different stuff, role playing, card games, you know,
10110780	10116820	games like Super Meat Boy, Nick's Quest was another good one I had played for a bit, you
10116820	10119100	know, first-person shooters.
10119100	10122900	So when I get bored of one thing, I kind of switch it around to another thing, so that
10122900	10127500	way I don't get too burnt out on playing one genre of a certain game.
10127500	10131660	That's not bad advice at all, and especially, you know, with thanks to the magic of emulators,
10131660	10135860	or I'm sorry, Virtual Console, you know, you can have a variety of different games, you
10135860	10139100	know, especially the old school stuff, you know, because that's what our listeners seem
10139100	10140880	to enjoy, that you can go back and forth to.
10140880	10144580	You know, one odd suggestion maybe I would have for that listener, and maybe this is
10144580	10148280	one of those things where I'll get laughed out of the room, but maybe that person should
10148280	10150040	try an MMO?
10150040	10154180	Maybe if games were a little more social, I don't know, like, for me, like WoW being
10154180	10159220	the big social thing it is, kind of keeps me, is what keeps me coming back to that game,
10159220	10160220	but at the same time...
10160220	10166620	And there's a lot of free ones, too, there's, I mean, I used to play, before I played WoW,
10166620	10172140	I played a Persona one that they had that was totally free, so I mean, you know, you
10172140	10177340	don't have to really pay to play, so to speak, you know, there's a lot of free stuff out
10177340	10181340	there, it's just, you know, it might be another niche, or, you know, something else totally
10181340	10182340	different out there.
10182340	10185180	You know, I don't think there's anything wrong, though, with the advice of, you know, if you
10185180	10187980	think you're bored of video games, take a break, there's nothing wrong with it, you
10187980	10191480	don't have to game every single day, I'm not gonna think any less of you, none of us will,
10191480	10192480	you know?
10192480	10193480	That's not true, but that's alright.
10193480	10194480	Stop.
10194480	10201180	Go watch some movies, or catch up on TV shows, go read a book, go start another project,
10201180	10203900	and then maybe you'll find that game that wants to bring you back.
10203900	10207660	And, you know, it's kind of interesting, too, when you're talking about this whole, you
10207660	10211580	know, we're, you know, about being lazy and stuff, it's because mostly we get technology,
10211580	10218020	our technology has grown so rapidly, so quickly, and it's so easy to access a lot of different
10218020	10221660	stuff so quickly, like, why do I need to go to the library to check out a book?
10221660	10225220	I can go online and buy the book straight from Amazon and get it right here in my own
10225220	10231220	living room, or why do you have to, you know, it's just, unfortunately, with technology
10231220	10236540	that, you know, there's always pros and cons to everything, and unfortunately, a pro thing
10236540	10240780	is it's quicker and easier, but a con is, too, is that we don't do as much as we used
10240780	10245820	to, and it's like, we get to a point in society now, it's like, we want things almost virtually
10245820	10250100	handed to us, because we're like, well, we can get this this way, why can't we do this?
10250100	10254060	I've got to admit, I've bought a book on my iPhone before, and one of the reasons I kind
10254060	10259380	of like that sort of technology is that I have the book with me everywhere I go in case
10259380	10263980	I'm ever bored, and that way I'm not carrying around a bulky book, you know?
10263980	10268080	That's kind of the one, like, really advantage I like of having it on there.
10268080	10273100	But I do also understand, you know, there's really no substitute for an old, dusty book.
10273100	10274100	Yeah.
10274100	10276300	So, I mean, but, you know, I still read books.
10276300	10280180	I have plenty of books on my shelf that I read that's actual, physical books.
10280180	10283780	I mean, you know, not everything is an e-book, it's clearly my strategy guides, I mean, I
10283780	10287780	have a lot of limited edition strategy guides that I like to have, just for, you know, collector's
10287780	10291140	editions, just for, you know, to have on my shelf, because I like looking at them.
10291140	10296780	So I mean, you know, so I mean, there's, it's kind of funny when you're saying that, because
10296780	10301060	it brought me back to the whole thing back when I was taking technology in class in high
10301060	10304140	school, and we're talking about, you know, because of all these pros, there's going to
10304140	10310860	be con, you know, like fast food, and movies, and now we got books, and video games, and,
10310860	10315340	you know, we don't have to do as much as we used to, to get what we want.
10315340	10321540	It's okay, I press a few buttons, or click on a few things, and boom, there it is, so.
10321540	10322540	Boom there it is.
10322540	10324860	That's, that's definitely the culture we live in now.
10324860	10329300	All right, X-Link, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for
10329300	10330300	the call, as always.
10330300	10331300	As always.
10331300	10332300	All right.
10332300	10334300	How proud are you of Jamie, and her level 63?
10334300	10335300	I'm very proud of her.
10335300	10340740	30 levels in one week, Jesus, I can't do anything more, you might get explicit for it.
10340740	10346220	Yeah, but, yeah, damn, that's all I'm gonna say, damn, I couldn't believe that, 30 levels
10346220	10352020	in almost a week, I, that was just amazing, that, that really, congratulations.
10352020	10354620	Thank you, and, and thank you as well for the gift.
10354620	10356020	Okay, any time.
10356020	10358060	You know, I don't, I don't want to start stuff.
10358060	10361140	Please do not read into what I'm about to say the wrong way, because I have nothing
10361140	10364680	but respect for other independent podcasters and other indie shows, but there's another
10364680	10368020	Warcraft show on this network, and I enjoy the show, it's a great show, I listen to it
10368020	10372580	almost every week, but the guy on that show, I think he's been level 51 for, like, four
10372580	10378660	years or something like that, and, you know, I, play a game how you want to play a game,
10378660	10384600	that's fine, but just, for you to blow through 30 levels in a week just kind of made me laugh
10384600	10388900	a little bit, because I'm just kind of like, man, I know other people that are just, like,
10388900	10392420	they've been, they, they don't even do a level a month.
10392420	10396500	I'm still gonna see if it's possible for me to make 85 before classes start next week.
10396500	10400820	Well, what, it took me to get, it almost took me a year to get to 80, but that's only because
10400820	10405340	I was only playing a few times a week, and, and I was just doing it a few, few hours a
10405340	10410980	day, and, but then again, how was I get to 82, Rob, again, when I got Cata?
10410980	10411980	Archaeology whoring.
10411980	10416260	That's right, there we go, non-stop, so, yeah, that was a lot of fun.
10416260	10420680	You guys are gonna have to show me the ropes, but, the one thing, though, is that, and this
10420680	10424980	is, I think, what chased me off before, is the whole feeling like I'm being forced to
10424980	10426980	play with people, you know?
10426980	10430540	Just do whatever you want to do, like I said before, you had to open the invitation to
10430540	10434540	our raids on Wednesday, and if you want to, that's fine, if you don't, you know, there's
10434540	10435540	no right or wrong.
10435540	10439700	Well, no, I understand that, I've just, I've, I've been getting the, oh, the, the whole
10439700	10443980	game experience is when you're playing with, doing, you know, the dungeon thing with a
10443980	10448420	lot of people, and I'm like, I've been enjoying playing by myself, I like playing with one
10448420	10449420	or two people.
10449420	10452180	Really quickly, and I'm not, I'm not gonna say too much on this, because I know people
10452180	10456300	are gonna get shut off, but just like, oh, shit, they're talking about WoW, um, Rob invited
10456300	10460860	me to WoW a year ago, and when I started playing, I thought for sure that it's gonna be kind
10460860	10463860	of like, oh, I'm like, okay, Rob's gonna show me ropes, and I'm gonna do all this stuff,
10463860	10466740	and this is gonna be great, and blah, blah, blah, and I know Rob had his own thing, he
10466740	10471380	was really busy with work and whatnot, I, I mean, Rob testified, there was times when
10471380	10475940	I had to play with him, but for the most part, between me getting to one and 80, was, other
10475940	10481100	than the help from another guild leader of ours, um, who will remain nameless, that I
10481100	10487660	did 90% of that stuff on my own, I, I, I went through, I, I, I went through all the pug,
10487660	10493420	the pugging stuff, through the, the dungeons, and everything else, but for the most part,
10493420	10501500	I did non-stop questing from day one, from day one when I started to, when I got to,
10501500	10507040	like, 80, um, among a few odds and ends and PVP and whatnot, but, um, but yeah, I had
10507040	10510540	a lot of fun playing by myself, and that's one of the few games I can actually say, you
10510540	10515940	can play by yourself and have a lot of fun doing it, and you don't really need that,
10515940	10520100	that whole, that whole, oh, I need to play with six of my friends in order to get this
10520100	10521100	done.
10521100	10523580	And you need to play with your friends, too, that's what keeps me in WoW, is raiding.
10523580	10524580	Definitely, definitely, by far.
10524580	10528580	So, alright, well, anyhow, I gotta let you go before we have Horde House to spin off
10528580	10531660	here, but thank you so much for, uh, your call, okay, buddy?
10531660	10533460	Any time, any time for me.
10533460	10534460	Later.
10534460	10537420	I think, uh, pretty soon, I think, especially, like, when you hit, like, about maybe, like,
10537420	10540540	level 70 or so, we're gonna have to, well, maybe soon, we'll have to run you into some
10540540	10543460	dungeons and, uh, show you the ropes in dungeons.
10543460	10547380	I just wanna basically learn how to play with other people so that if I decide that I wanna
10547380	10549700	be social, that I'm not gonna kill everybody.
10549700	10550700	Yeah.
10550700	10554420	I have a problem of accidentally casting my area of effect.
10554420	10559860	The dark side of pug groups is that they're not always noob-friendly, and, you know, they
10559860	10564460	expect that you know everything, and you may not, and that's very unfortunate, but anyway,
10564460	10565460	let's move on.
10565460	10566740	I don't wanna get too far into WoW talk.
10566740	10569220	Uh, alright, that's gonna do it, though, for the Skypline tonight.
10569220	10572100	Thank you guys so much for, uh, your calls, really appreciate it.
10572100	10576180	Uh, if you didn't get through, send us an email, mailbag at orangeliontrader.com or
10576180	10580300	a tweet at twitter.com slash o-l-r, there's plenty of ways to interact with our program.
10580300	10582020	There's also the live chat room every week.
10582020	10586140	Alright, uh, that, however, is going to bring us to the end of another episode of Orange
10586140	10587140	Lounge Radio.
10587140	10588740	We're all done here.
10588740	10591420	Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10591420	10594460	Uh, actually, first I should ask Loki if there's any other last minute stories.
10594460	10595460	I don't think-
10595460	10596460	I'm done.
10596460	10597460	Oh, you're done?
10597460	10599020	Alright, well then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10599020	10601620	Uh, DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?
10601620	10604240	85 by Wednesday.
10604240	10605240	Good luck.
10605240	10606820	Not 85, I meant 65.
10606820	10608820	Oh yeah, you can do it.
10608820	10609820	65 by tomorrow?
10609820	10610820	Yeah.
10610820	10611820	I don't know your schedule.
10611820	10612820	Maybe.
10612820	10613820	Just made 63.
10613820	10614820	Alright.
10614820	10615820	Loki, what's your final thought?
10615820	10619860	Um, I don't know, Tron.
10619860	10624180	My final thought is, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Sherie, Sherie, Sherie, Sherie, Sherie,
10624180	10625180	Shermie, Sherie, Sherie.
10625180	10626180	Yeah, she just came waddling out.
10626180	10628500	That's right, now she's just sitting there waiting to poop.
10628500	10629500	Hey, babycakes.
10629500	10630500	Alright.
10630500	10632500	Can I say something to everybody?
10632500	10633980	Let's talk about the tester.
10633980	10639580	I don't think Shermie is very talkative.
10639580	10641900	Shermie's like, what the hell is that?
10641900	10643020	Get that out of my face.
10643020	10644020	No comment.
10644020	10645020	Alright.
10645020	10647900	Uh, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us.
10647900	10649260	We really appreciate your support.
10649260	10652260	Remember, if you like what you heard, we don't make any money off of this show.
10652260	10655300	All we ask is that you tell, uh, one or two people about the show.
10655300	10660620	Help us spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio, especially as we approach our 400th episode
10660620	10661620	next month.
10661620	10662700	I can't believe it.
10662700	10663700	Thank you guys again.
10663700	10664700	Have a wonderful week.
10664700	10665700	We'll see you next week.
10665700	10670420	I'm going to be back here to do it all again with a three day weekend, by the way, for
10670420	10671420	me next week.
10671420	10677020	So, you never know what antics might, if I could get a ride home somehow, uh, we, you
10677020	10678020	never know.
10678020	10679020	You can sleep on the couch.
10679020	10680020	You never know what antics might happen.
10680020	10681020	You can sleep in the vault.
10681020	10682660	Do you want to do a drunk show next week that bad?
10682660	10683660	Will you drink?
10683660	10684660	I know he won't.
10684660	10685660	He can't.
10685660	10686660	He's got to be responsible daddy, but will you?
10686660	10687660	Maybe, maybe I will.
10687660	10688660	Okay.
10688660	10693780	I, because it's been that long, I will get nice and toasty on air for listeners if I
10693780	10695740	can figure out a ride home or something.
10695740	10696740	Okay.
10696740	10698740	So maybe I'll, I'll see if somebody can drive me to the show.
10698740	10699740	We'll see.
