14509	26688	A popular PC game prepares for release on Xbox Live, more details come out about the next Elder Scrolls game, and EA prepares to disconnect the servers for several old games.
31394	38439	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
38519	47805	We do tape live at All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern-ish, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show wraps up.
48045	52608	We really like Bobby because he always has us on our show and does this nice little transition and
52848	61477	Tonight we were talking about light-up cereal boxes, but before we get to yummy, delicious electrical cereal, let me introduce the cast and crew here at Orange Lounge Radio.
61777	66281	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
66682	67062	Hi.
67342	67743	How are you?
68163	68623	I'm hungry.
68824	71987	What would you prefer, electric Trix or electric Honey Nut Cheerios?
72207	72507	Neither.
73288	73568	Why?
73929	74910	Because I hate both of them.
75410	77312	Well, what electric cereal would you like?
79167	79908	Frosted Mini Wheats.
81069	81649	Grape Nuts.
82670	88456	I adore Grape Nuts, but I'd have to say my favorite cereal of all time is Frosted Mini Wheats.
89477	90978	I'll get to my favorite cereal in a minute.
91018	92299	And yes, we'll talk about games too.
92840	95042	But say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
96303	96584	Hi.
96804	97665	Hi, how are you, Loki?
97865	98385	I'm fine.
98425	101148	I'm finishing my last piece of Honey Barbecue Chicken.
101668	103190	What was your favorite cereal growing up?
103250	104391	Honey Barbecue Chicken Nuggets?
104773	105073	Hell no.
105874	107214	Actually, you know, it's kind of funny.
107294	109035	I like both extremes of cereal.
109155	112397	Like, really bad for me cereal and really good for me cereal.
112417	113177	It's weird.
113417	119320	Like, I used to, and I still do, like Special K. Yes, the chick cereal.
121501	122542	I forgot about that.
122562	129845	That's one of the greatest moments of this show's history was when it came out that you enjoyed Special K. It's pretty good, actually.
129905	130405	It's not bad.
130826	133267	You know, Special K, I actually...
133767	134067	Captain Crunch
158942	159162	Really?
159222	162103	The one that is always last in the package for me is Lucky Charms.
162284	163404	I hate Lucky Charms.
163864	166505	And, well, Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
166826	168286	But here's the thing about Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
168486	169387	I hate it with milk.
169767	170847	So I have to eat it dry.
170867	174289	And it's just really, because all the cinnamon falls off.
174969	176530	I don't like cereal with milk at all.
176910	178191	I eat all my cereal dry.
178211	179531	Like, I know that's really weird to some people.
179551	180172	No, that's not weird at all.
180192	181312	But that's how I do it.
181592	183173	You know what the other one is really addicting?
185034	185654	What is it?
185874	186635	Golden Grahams.
187095	187235	Okay.
187815	189336	I can't stop eating that stuff.
189516	194738	Now you can't have a video game show and talk about cereal without bringing up Nintendo cereal.
194758	196178	Did anyone ever try that when they were younger?
196418	196959	I liked it.
196979	197759	I thought it was hideous.
197959	198219	Really?
198439	199059	I didn't mind it.
199139	199920	I thought it was pretty good.
199940	200540	I didn't like kid cereals.
201020	201900	I hated marshmallows.
202741	204061	I still hate marshmallows.
204081	208883	Nintendo cereal was closest probably to Froot Loops because I've soon remembered it was more like fruity and sugary.
209583	210704	I think that would be the taste it was close to.
210724	212204	Froot Loops weren't really big on my plate either.
212304	213225	I mean they were okay.
213285	214325	I just didn't like it.
215017	216661	I don't remember Nintendo cereal having marshmallows.
216681	217303	I don't think it did.
217423	218486	break into the shredded wheat.
220070	224119	I would say my favorite breakfast cereal of all time, and this might surprise some people, is Crispix.
225097	225838	Crispix is good.
226078	227319	I fucking love Crispix.
227339	229681	That's like half rice on one side, half corn on the other.
229721	230561	Oh, that stuff is good.
230581	231282	And gluten-free.
231302	232062	I don't know what it is.
232463	233463	It's amazing.
233664	234544	It's my favorite cereal.
234584	235805	It's not even a sugar candy cereal.
235825	236946	Damn, I need to get a box of that.
237006	237927	It's so good.
238607	239468	It's the texture.
239828	242570	It's so gross, but it's the truth.
242991	246333	I love putting Crispix and using my tongue to smash it to little bits.
246774	248835	I used to do that too.
248895	249796	Everybody does it.
249816	251137	It's just no one talks about it.
251457	262905	And then I would eat one half of one side And then eat the other half It's like eating an Oreo with no cream filling It's with milk filling I remember when they first brought Crispix out I mean, that was something that came out later on in my life
266252	267733	and DarkTetsuya in our chat room.
267773	269413	Of course, we have to introduce the chat room.
269433	270113	We love the chatters.
270454	272374	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
272734	275716	DarkTetsuya wants to know, are there any cereal podcasts out there?
276316	278276	I don't know, but maybe we need to start one.
280157	281158	We'll have to look for one.
281418	281798	I don't know.
282318	283859	And many folks in our chat room agree.
283879	285859	Yes, there's one called the Ethereal Cereal Podcast.
286559	287200	Shut up.
287320	287520	Really?
287560	288400	I just found it.
289100	290541	Is it really about breakfast cereal?
290561	292082	That's what I'm going to find out.
292802	293082	All right.
293782	296543	Well, anyhow, we will talk plenty more about breakfast cereal.
296563	297704	There's one called Get Cereal.
297804	298764	Food and everything.
299225	300605	But we have to talk about our gaming weeks.
300625	301866	We've got to bring it back to video games.
302206	302966	It is a new year.
303026	303146	It's 2011.
304407	311410	Kind of a tiny, tiny lull in new games right now because everyone, I think, is catching up from last year's games.
311830	314091	But things are going to hit the ground fast.
314411	316412	LittleBigPlanet 2, I believe, is this week.
316832	319754	And that's just going to be the first in several huge, huge releases.
320054	320634	Oh, next week.
320694	321314	Loki's correcting me.
321334	322775	I knew it was January mid-somewhere.
323195	351752	But very soon that's going to come out and that's kind of the first of several bing bing bing big stuff coming up Oh yeah, DC Universe is this week, thank you Loki So I'm going to be quitting World of Warcraft When I played the beta on PC I had a good time with it So I never did get around to playing the PS3 one and they pulled the plug on it So I'm torn, I don't know if I really want to get into DC Universe or not But anyway, I guess we can talk about that later Let's talk about what's going on right now in your gaming week Dark Sakura, start us off
352190	354171	I hit level 63 right before the show.
369115	378937	Um, but this whole, like, like if you go listen to the last show on the feed right now, I'm pretty sure you were still hating on World of Warcraft and Razami for playing it.
379277	384738	So like podcaster only people have no idea that you have now leveled to 63.
384798	385538	Not last week.
386038	387998	Cause last week was after I got back from Washington.
388018	390179	No, the last show on the archives was.
390339	391119	Oh, on the archives.
391259	391579	Yeah.
391719	391999	Yeah.
392139	392339	No.
392819	396520	Well, they, they changed enough in it that I was like, okay, I got it.
396680	397440	I got to give it a try.
398280	403962	Because, you know me, I'm not gonna bitch about something without having tried it myself.
404502	404703	Good.
404803	406443	I think that's a good thing to do.
406463	409044	I mean, and besides that, I just like fucking with you guys, you know?
409064	409985	No, I know, I know.
410005	414066	It's just like I mess with you for some of the things you like, but secretly it's alright.
414986	418728	Which, for the record, I haven't touched Second Life since the last time I said I haven't touched Second Life.
419128	421491	And for the record, Grape Nuts aren't so bad.
421692	422613	They're actually pretty good.
422653	423554	Grape Nuts are great.
423594	424455	They're great!
425196	425436	Anyway.
425917	429982	I, on the other hand, think Grape Nuts are nasty and you really shouldn't touch Second Life ever.
432003	433584	Some things never change on this program.
433884	435785	So anyway, anyway.
437426	438727	I, well, okay.
439247	444951	I know last week live I, you know, mentioned that I had really hurt my lower back.
445111	446532	It's technically my right hip.
447072	447452	Really bad.
447492	448053	I sprained my hip.
448493	451515	Although it's more funny to say I sprained my butt because really it's,
451815	452776	You broke your butt.
454117	457679	But I've been seeing my chiropractor.
457799	463343	I have one more appointment to go to and it still hurts but it's not nearly as the debilitating pain I was in before.
463763	470888	So all I could do is just sit here on an ice pack and play World of Warcraft because what else was there for me to do?
470928	476812	I've done everything in Star Trek Online and I still love Star Trek Online so much but all I was doing was freaking playing Dabo.
477632	479514	And there's only so much gambling one can do.
480875	483696	I really like this point in our chatroom here from Salacious Pop.
483736	489380	In my opinion, this just proves that Blizzard properly redid the experience in Kata, which was the point.
489400	492182	1-60 was still from 2004 and shitty.
492262	494524	If Jamie likes it now, then they really gave it an overhaul.
495205	502455	Yeah, well, and now Dan was like, oh, they dumbed it down for people so that people can, you know, have a more rewarding experience and blah, blah, blah.
503036	510065	And I was like, you know, when I first, when I first, first started playing, this was, you know, when I got Burning Crusade, when it was new, ooh.
511847	514048	It was like, okay, I've done everything.
514169	515069	I'm not going anywhere.
515189	515790	I've done all this.
515910	516851	I'm not going anywhere.
517571	518352	Fucking boring.
518672	523115	Same gameplay over and over and over and over and nothing interesting.
523235	524876	And I think that's a big part of the change, too.
524916	530500	I don't want to go too far into this because, again, we have the separate Warcraft show now because we talk too much about it on this show.
530580	535464	But it's important because where Warcraft goes, like it or not, it is the biggest MMO right now.
535564	538086	The rest of the industry will follow Warcraft.
538446	541008	with some exceptions, which we'll get into even later in the show.
541088	549736	But my point, in old Vanilla WoW, a lot of the quests were fetch me animal pelts, kill X number of monsters.
549776	550797	And they still have a lot of that.
551057	558523	And there is a lot of that, but they've also mixed in a lot of more interesting technology from the newer expansions, like vehicle stuff from Rapid Lich King.
558563	561486	Use this item to scrape tar off this creature's ass.
561646	562727	Yes, things like that.
562847	563948	You know what I'm talking about too, don't you?
564569	565650	No one, because I haven't done that quest.
565670	567391	But did you get to dig through the poop for the key?
567892	568052	No.
568072	568712	That quest I did.
569253	570054	I did see the one.
570114	571655	Okay, now Tiara showed me this one.
572536	578781	It was where you go to, oh crap, what's the, not the Outlands, but the place where everything's red?
579842	580703	That has the big scar?
581812	582212	Baron's?
583433	583893	Badlands.
584253	584473	Okay.
585114	587355	Because keep in mind, I'm still learning what everything's called.
589176	596900	And you run into a gnome, a dwarf, and something else.
597060	597820	A pizza place?
598141	598341	No.
599761	600502	I see what you did there.
601042	603243	It's not a setup for a bad joke.
603343	607385	The dwarf is like, I went up to Deathwing and I punched him in the face!
610180	612843	I got on my motorcycle and picked up some hot babes, and we had a tender moment.
630539	633462	Oh, that's the one where one of the hot babes is a blood elf male.
633862	634543	I remember that.
634943	635764	Alright, I've seen that.
636384	636745	Good times.
637345	642530	But basically they were all telling tall tales and it was really funny.
642590	643090	It was cute.
643591	646353	So that's what I like is that there's a lot more comedy thrown in there.
646693	651718	It's like the quests have names that make me laugh my ass off.
652178	656983	And I'm still pissed off at that stupid dragon for setting the world on fire and not setting me on fire.
657743	658724	Stupid fucking dragon.
659865	660986	You were online with me for this.
661086	661466	I was.
661746	664188	And you're like, I'm standing in the fire and not dying.
664248	664928	What is wrong?
664988	667450	I took a screen capture of me in the fire not dying.
670052	671313	I wanted the damn achievement.
672053	673935	And then I got achievements that you don't have.
675056	675336	Whatever.
675356	675996	Thanks to X-Link.
676116	676597	No one, Kerr.
676937	677197	All right.
678038	679639	What else besides WoW have you been playing?
679659	682641	Well, also, thank you for the thing that you sort of were in on.
683121	683602	You're welcome.
684409	685430	I got 800 gold.
685450	686671	I'm gonna go buy me a bird.
687932	690854	No, I was playing other stuff, though it was really solitaire.
692075	693416	And Mushihime-sama!
693816	695237	Because that game is crack.
696278	700321	I tell you, cave fans, if you want a little fun, it's still bullet hell.
700641	701882	It's just bullet hell with running.
702983	707546	And, like, you target stuff, and then you let your things fall, but you still have to avoid the bullet.
707666	708267	It's bullet hell.
708407	709468	It's bullet hell on feet.
710668	711129	Well, hell.
712130	712530	It's great.
713910	714891	Loki, how was your gaming week?
715691	716191	It was okay.
716852	718993	I played a few different things this week.
720113	723115	I played The Flying Hamster, which is pretty awesome.
723415	741563	It was a game that was a PSP Mini at one point, and they just brought it over to the iOS platform, and it's kind of a shooter game where you play a chibi flying hamster who has to save his hamster girlfriend or something like that, and it's a shooter, and it's really hard, actually, but it's all chibi, and it's kind of cool.
742723	743203	So I played that.
743884	746404	And then, uh, more Sword and Poker 2.
746484	748765	I'm actually almost done with that game.
749005	755048	I'm in the last dungeon, and I'm maybe six floors in, so that's pretty cool.
756228	758869	Um, what else did I play?
759109	762831	I think I played a little bit more, uh, Cannonbolt, which is fun.
763451	763591	Um...
766684	766904	Oh yeah.
768226	770288	And then, more Grand Theft Auto.
770509	775374	But finally, after working on it for six months, we got our new modded games running again.
775855	777457	And I tell you, that first game...
778769	779490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
800091	804114	Aren't having as much fun as they could be having because I usually am kicking the crap out of them.
805275	809778	Whereas the mod games, everybody has fun and it's just so over the top.
809998	815601	I was hysterically laughing throughout the whole game because all this crazy shit was happening.
815982	818924	It was awesome.
818944	821385	I'm looking forward to playing more of that.
821926	826269	This time though, we hot swapped all of our drives so we don't get banned.
827890	829571	So our consoles don't get banned this time.
831051	832112	I'm pretty fast at it now.
832152	835333	I can hot swap a console in about 15 minutes.
835393	837174	It's like field stripping a gun or something.
837194	838534	It's pretty quick.
839394	841835	So yeah, I played that.
843336	845777	Actually looking forward to playing some new games soon.
846657	847798	I'm going to pick up LittleBigPlanet.
848218	856141	I have the collector's edition on order because I want those bookends and the little stuffed plush sack boy for my desk.
856501	856821	And then...
860041	862524	Actually, that's probably going to be the newest thing I'm going to play for a while.
862784	869732	I am going to actually finally update my console now that certain hacks have come out that allow custom firmwares and whatnot.
869912	872615	On any firmware console.
875270	877472	You want to get Linux on your good old PS3 again, huh?
879954	881195	I don't really want even Linux.
881255	887721	And here's the thing is I had the opportunity to actually mod my console to where I could pirate games on it.
887881	891904	But I just didn't want to pirate games on the PS3.
892445	894687	And that's saying something.
896468	922260	and it's not a good something alright let's see moving on to my gaming week sadly I don't have a lot of new new stuff to report I haven't had a lot of money to buy a lot of extra games lately so it's mostly the same stuff I was talking about last week with Fallout 3 and continuing on White Knight Chronicles a little more although I have to admit the online stuff still doesn't make sense to me but whatever at least my internet is somewhat cooperating so I can keep a connection to PlayStation Network now
922700	948563	so that's nice so I guess I'll dip in a little bit and talk about some iPhone games that I've checked out recently one of them that I think you guys would like and this was something that was somebody had shouted out to me on Twitter and I so apologize because I forgot who sent this to me on Twitter but it's a game called VGMC or Video Game Music Challenge and it's free on the App Store and all it is is it plays like theme songs from old school video games and you're given like
949264	950084	I'm going to try Paperboy.
950104	950364	Correct!
950424	950944	Here's another one.
983291	984131	Mario 3, right?
984372	984632	Yeah.
984832	986933	So that probably doesn't pick up on the speed review, so I apologize.
986953	988473	It's all kind of mid-ied.
989394	990014	A little bit, yeah.
990034	991975	It's not like the original, original stuff, but it's all mid-ied.
991995	993876	But hey, it was free, so I think that's kind of cool.
994296	995557	I did play that too, I forgot.
995597	995857	Did you?
996077	996277	Yes.
996437	996978	Yeah, it's cute.
997058	997478	I like that.
997598	998278	So that was a fun one.
998838	1004321	I played a little bit of Cut the Rope, the holiday edition, which is this really popular iPhone game, is Cut the Rope.
1004661	1010504	But I'm cheap, and I like to have a lot of the free demos before I buy games, and so they have this holiday edition that's free.
1010904	1012365	And it's basically a puzzle game.
1012645	1013245	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1038755	1040236	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1059565	1087638	for money and it's like it's too hard to just get in there and like play a game the interface is shit I'm sorry I don't have a nice way of saying it like they have just destroyed the game because they're trying too hard to build this music store around it and I don't need all this I don't really like all this other bullshit like OpenFaint and I don't even like Game Center and some of this other stuff like I really wish there was just one for all of it and to be honest I honestly
1088138	1095001	As much as I like OpenFaint and what it's trying to do, we need one standard across all the iPhone games.
1095301	1100543	And I think Apple ought to just step in and say, it's Game Center and get the fuck out.
1100663	1103284	We're going to stop approving your apps if it has any other shit in it.
1103384	1110788	I know that's a terrible thing to say because Game Center is the worst of all of them, but maybe they can work with the OpenFaint people.
1110908	1111328	I don't know.
1111388	1115490	But I think it's ridiculous that you have all these different games and they have all these different add-ons.
1115510	1116610	They should just buy and absorb OpenFaint.
1116790	1117331	or something.
1117511	1117891	I don't know.
1118532	1122116	So there's a lot of people that are going to really hate that I said that but it's just annoying.
1122276	1123798	I kind of don't like either of them though.
1123818	1126400	I hate all these freaking pop-ups when I start games.
1126701	1128082	Sign up for OpenFaint.
1128182	1129784	Sign up for this network.
1129964	1130345	No!
1130505	1132947	I have an iPhone so I don't have to play with other people.
1134089	1134389	You know?
1135170	1135390	Yeah.
1135951	1136111	So.
1136724	1140786	Hey, let your friends on Twitter and Facebook know that you're playing another fake game.
1140886	1144588	I will post on Facebook if I want them to know I'm playing this game.
1144648	1145928	It's getting to be too much.
1146209	1148490	I want a Facebook update every time I score a point.
1149773	1151675	No, no, no, no.
1152636	1155739	And then, believe it or not, I downloaded Smurf Village on the iPhone.
1156640	1157601	It's stupid.
1157641	1158562	It's a Facebook game.
1158602	1161285	If you like those Facebook grindy games, then have fun.
1162166	1167352	I prefer Knights of the Clicky on Facebook, which, by the way, I got Extover to play, or he played it.
1167372	1171436	I don't know, because he heard one of us talking about it, and he said it was the worst thing he'd ever played in his life.
1173238	1173818	Night of the Crystal
1188286	1192210	Yeah, you kind of echo a lot of people that are kind of done with Knights of the Clicky.
1192250	1197316	Like, once you beat that final boss, you can kind of grind old quests and stuff, but there's not a lot else to do.
1197776	1201000	Now, they did just recently release... I can't believe I'm talking about a Facebook game.
1201020	1203362	We really do need... They released some new levels.
1203482	1207547	We really do need an official Knights of the Clicky starring Clicky the Pen.
1208508	1208768	Yeah.
1210490	1213314	A different show on the network owns the rights to that character.
1213374	1216318	So you'll have to get agreements and contracts.
1216679	1221265	You know, I haven't gotten to the last boss because I actually have been going through for gold mastery on other levels.
1221485	1221766	Oh, wow.
1221866	1223328	And now I'm like, this is boring.
1223348	1224449	What the crap am I doing?
1224689	1225070	I'm done.
1227192	1228254	Some comments in our chat room.
1228274	1229855	Some talk about Steam and Apple.
1229915	1233139	William Murderface says Apple needs to get in bed with Steam already.
1233499	1233759	No.
1234000	1235641	Actdeft says Apple kind of already did that.
1235741	1237163	That's when Portal came out for free.
1237843	1238364	And that's true.
1238484	1240867	Steam is on the Apple system now.
1241047	1243389	Yeah, it's good for them, but I mean, no.
1243870	1245111	Apple doesn't need to buy Steam.
1245231	1246692	There was some other big news in the
1271429	1274111	Anyhow, let's move on into some housekeeping tonight.
1274871	1285797	No show stuff as far as I know, although I will say it looks like we can kind of project now when episode number 400 will be, although we have yet to plan anything special for it.
1286117	1298344	But if tonight is episode 396, then 397, 398, 399, episode number 400 of Orange Launch Radio will be February 6th of this year, assuming we do not miss any shows between now and then.
1298664	1300225	Or do not have a show at 3.99 and a half
1322504	1325766	I'm sure some daily ones have, but I don't know about any other weekly shows.
1325846	1333029	So if there are, I don't know of them, which would be a surprise at this point because that means you have to be doing a show for at least eight, nine years like we have.
1333069	1337171	So yeah, we'll be kind of doing something a little special for episode 400.
1337211	1338352	We just don't know what yet.
1339172	1341133	In good OLR fashion, we're procrastinating.
1342033	1344155	Otherwise, you can join us on Facebook.
1344475	1347017	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1347678	1348999	How about another marathon episode?
1349039	1349799	You like those, right?
1350820	1351220	I'm not working.
1351320	1355043	Or Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.
1355603	1357545	How about we get into some gaming news?
1358426	1360187	Loki, start us off tonight with some gaming news.
1360507	1375592	Yes, so of course there's some information, I mean, slightly before when the US announcement and stuff comes out on the 19th, but some stuff about the 3DS launch in Japan.
1376032	1381754	They've announced 10 titles that are going to be expected for launch.
1381794	1384215	I guess the Japanese launch date will be February 26th.
1385455	1386776	And the titles you can expect...
1387616	1406687	Winnie11 3DS, Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition, Samurai Warriors Chronicle, Tobidasu Puzzle Bobble 3D, Nintendogs Plus Cats,
1408968	1431202	Wow, they're going to do three versions of that too Toy Poodle and New Friends French Bulldog and New Friends and Sheba and New Friends Yes, I will not be stupid this time and buy all three versions Actually, I'll be smart this time and not buy any version Ridge Racer 3 I don't know, I kind of want the kitties I want the kitties too
1433291	1441518	Ridge Racer 3D, Combat of Giants, Dinosaur 3D, and Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle.
1442658	1444700	So those are expected out.
1446141	1452606	Also it says there's supposed to be some new titles announced as well, including BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2.
1453847	1463393	and ports of Tales of the Abyss and Raving Rabbids Travel in Time, as well as the third game in the Tank Beat series.
1465635	1467476	So those are going to be some launch titles.
1468357	1476002	No real word on what the pricing is going to be over here yet, but in Japan it looks like they're kind of ranging around, looks like 4,980 yen to say about...
1481886	1482246	6,090 yen.
1483208	1483929	So between, say, $60 and $73.
1483969	1487574	Obviously, it's a lot more expensive over there.
1494938	1497219	I was going to say, there's got to be... They're not going to be $70 games.
1497239	1498560	They're not going to be $70 games here.
1498740	1501201	But they'll be more expensive than DS games, won't they?
1501461	1505463	They will be more... They'll use the 3D thing as an excuse to charge a $10 premium.
1505703	1506664	They will.
1506804	1514808	I've already said before that one of the launch titles I've seen actually have an actual price to it is $40 retail.
1514828	1514928	So...
1516969	1517069	D.S.
1517089	1517209	Games
1535544	1541568	There have been one or two $40 retail games, but I'm expecting probably a $10 increase.
1541908	1546471	You're probably going to see everything from $40 to a $50 as a high-end game, would be my guess.
1551735	1577555	and then of course there's some more information regarding the battery life for the 3DS they're saying that the 3DS has a 3-5 hour battery life for playing 3DS games of course it's going to be a little bit longer if you're playing regular DS games which is going to be 5-8 hours and they're saying that's probably because it doesn't have to run the third display since the two displays are interlaced on the top screen um
1578496	1579317	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1602236	1603937	Samurai Warriors Chronicles Dead or Alive Super Monkey Ball
1626275	1628276	So where's the hype at right now?
1628296	1637042	Because let me go to a comment in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Defective Candy in our chatroom says, I love Nintendo, but I'm just not going to invest in a 3DS when it comes out.
1637182	1641825	I'm going to wait until they release a second version just to make sure all the bugs are worked out.
1642185	1643666	And I think that's a good question to ask.
1643846	1645786	Where's the hype meter now for the 3DS?
1646267	1648728	Because are you guys interested in buying one now?
1649008	1650908	Or are you kind of where Defective Candy's at?
1650928	1651689	Where you're like, you know what?
1652069	1659872	There is always inevitably the GBA with the backlight, the DS Lite, the second iteration of the handheld that comes out later.
1659892	1662093	Yeah, but here's the thing with me and the DS Lite and all that stuff.
1663013	1665534	I didn't really care about the DS Lite.
1665814	1676959	I guess the only iteration would be the DSi that was slightly different where they actually had SD storage and the cameras on it and stuff like that.
1676999	1678320	That's a little different.
1679621	1684343	I don't know if you'd even consider that a different system almost, but it pretty much was.
1685223	1700364	um sadly it won't ever be utilized and remember they're going to be having dsi only games and there was a handful of those but they're kind of crap a lot of them were crap it was just unlock extra stuff that there's really no reason we shut out of the regular ds version exactly um so
1701485	1702626	I don't know.
1702786	1707809	I'm actually planning on getting one at launch.
1709770	1717415	They haven't announced any launch titles yet, but I know one of the titles that they were working on that was supposed to be for the 3DS was the new Excite Truck game.
1718796	1723258	I'm telling you, if they have a new Excite Truck game at launch, I will not be able to resist.
1723699	1726480	No, but I am planning on getting one at launch.
1726700	1744829	And just because I don't really care about the reiterations that come out later on, unless they add major features to them, it doesn't really matter to me that they shrink down the size of the system, or they make the system bigger, or they have a different color.
1745030	1745750	I don't care.
1746840	1747601	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1770815	1778001	So here's and I'm really gonna make myself sound like an a-hole by saying this but here's where I'm coming from that a lot of you aren't coming from.
1778902	1794095	I've seen the 3DS and I've played the 3DS and like I swear I'm not saying that to be a jerk but I'm telling you I'm saying that because when you see this technology for the first time and you're like I'm looking at 3D with no glasses and
1795126	1795667	and DarkSakura.com
1817708	1819589	I gotta say, I really want one.
1840976	1841456	Thanks for watching!
1861929	1862629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1882034	1882854	Ooh, touchpad.
1883294	1885495	You're really catching up with everybody.
1886396	1895619	Well, I don't want to sound like a broken record on this show, but I always think the PSP's strength was not just as a gaming system, but as a comprehensive multimedia device.
1895639	1896839	But they're really kind of expensive.
1896859	1898299	And that's what the 3DS doesn't have.
1898440	1902121	I don't look at the 3DS going, I'm going to be able to browse the web in 3D.
1902241	1902641	No, I'm not.
1902941	1930915	but they're saying though that for example they were talking at CES during their keynote that they're having Sony tablets they didn't really come out and say the PSP phone but they're going to have the PSP phone they're going to have the PSP 2 probably at some point soon so I don't think they really care too much the fact that they can do all this stuff because pretty much everything now is doing all that stuff you can browse the web with any device almost
1931491	1932212	Except the DS.
1933172	1934313	Well, I guess you can.
1934333	1935835	Just not well.
1936095	1936315	All right.
1936575	1940879	Let me go to the chat room at chat.orangelearn.com because there's some interesting discussion going on here that I want to bring up.
1940979	1943841	Gamer Girl kind of started the thing off by saying, I hate 3D.
1943921	1945022	I can't watch that shit.
1945423	1947544	And Solar Flare says, 3D is a fad.
1948745	1955331	And CSCRSMAT454, sorry, I don't know what the preferred name is there, wait for a price drop.
1956131	1956332	Hmm.
1957401	1958001	Well, here's the thing.
1958702	1959602	Can I say this real quick, though?
1959842	1967445	I also think I'm getting a little sick of the whole 3Ds in the movie thing because I think most movies don't benefit from it.
1967866	1968566	Tron sure did.
1968746	1971087	Yeah, but then I'm like, but Tron was actually really awesome in 3D.
1971107	1972828	I thought Avatar was great in 3D.
1973648	1975769	You know, and it's so difficult.
1976710	1977750	But I think there's too much.
1977770	1979371	Like, Gulliver's Travels 3D, no thanks.
1979811	1980671	Not gonna bother.
1980791	1981472	Do not want.
1982452	1984074	But even something like Tangled was really cute.
1984094	1988137	Here's the thing though, Gulliver's Travel is not a movie targeted at you, Rob.
1988237	1990579	It's targeted at little kids that like Jack Black.
1990599	1994062	Well, it missed its target because it didn't do very well at the box office.
1994122	1995503	Well, that's the thing.
1995924	1996544	It's a gamble.
1996644	2002529	I mean, that's something... Jack Black does not put people in the seats anymore.
2003530	2004331	I don't know, but it's...
2006061	2010484	Speaking of which, I am going to sneak out to the theaters to see Tron one last time.
2011144	2011884	In D-Box.
2012385	2012825	In D-Box.
2012885	2013485	We need to go.
2013505	2022230	Because Friday, the 14th, is the last day that they will have... Actually, no, that will be the cutoff because they're going to be getting the new D-Box movie, which is...
2025695	2026256	Thanks for watching!
2044970	2050372	And I was very skeptical going into the 3DS, but seeing that technology for the first time without the glasses was pretty amazing.
2050692	2059274	And I have to admit, my favorite part, and this is something the movies don't give you, my favorite part was that there's a little slider where you can adjust the intensity of the 3D.
2059594	2063996	So it can be like, you know, kind of pulling on the eyes to, forget it, 2D.
2064756	2066396	Just throw the 3D out and have 2D.
2066916	2071538	So it's interesting to me that developers are going to have to consider that, that some people are going to want to play 3D, some want to play 2D.
2072678	2097312	I the reason why I'm excited about the 3D I want to see where it's going to take games because you know things like Doom, Quake, even things like Zelda when they first came out they were called 3D games this whole virtual reality and I think now that we have real 3D technology I'm really curious to see where that's going to take the gaming and interaction technology that's where I'm at
2097392	2098813	Sorry, Loki, I cut you off like five minutes.
2098833	2104535	Well, and then on the other thing is they don't have to necessarily use the 3DS top screen as a 3D screen.
2104975	2110057	They can use it as an HD 2D screen because you have twice the resolution now to play around with.
2110157	2113039	They don't have to actually interlace it to do 3D.
2113139	2117701	So I think there's a lot of potential to do some really good looking games.
2117861	2119521	And the games on it look really good.
2119561	2120142	I mean, like the...
2146564	2147345	We'll see.
2148446	2151648	I'm curious to know more details about what the US is getting.
2152148	2155150	I was very surprised to hear that there is no pack-in at all.
2155270	2158432	And we haven't heard what the new Mario game is going to be.
2158492	2160193	Can you imagine a new Mario game on this?
2160854	2161754	That would be sexy.
2162155	2170340	I also do have to mention that for the people in the chat room who are pissing about 3D, if you don't like it, don't see it.
2171823	2172263	Well, true.
2172483	2175466	But, you know, I did ask the question, who's going to buy this and who's not?
2175646	2176947	And so, if they're not, that's fine.
2176967	2181910	But I'm saying, you know, for the people who are just saying 3D is overdone, 3D is overdone, if you don't like it, fine.
2181950	2183011	Don't ruin it for the people that like it.
2184072	2186573	I don't, you know, that's this thing.
2187174	2190316	If you don't want your games in 3D, don't buy a 3DS.
2190956	2194559	If you don't want your movies in 3D, don't go see them in 3D.
2195239	2198221	If you don't want to watch TV in 3D, don't get a 3D TV.
2198682	2199482	It's that easy.
2199642	2200283	Stop bitching.
2201533	2202955	3D is slowly becoming the norm
2221494	2227804	But otherwise, everybody's talking about 3D, 3D, 3D TVs, 3D TVs without glasses, 3D... 3D's not going anywhere.
2227944	2232350	It's going to be around for a while, and it will become the norm, and people will just stop bitching about it.
2232430	2236777	It's not a fad, but yes, just like... So I can see where people are concerned about that.
2237233	2250699	But just like any emerging technology, just like with, you know, the Wii and stuff like that, the first, you know, the first games you have on the Wii or whatever are gonna be really cheesy and they're gonna be just some cheap ideas to utilize the technology.
2250739	2259423	Just like the first 3D movies, you know, there's a couple good ones and a lot of them were just tacked on 3D to get people in the seats because it's a 3D movie.
2259963	2263485	But a lot of stuff now, a lot of movies are being filmed in 3D.
2263825	2265166	Granted, you're not gonna see, you know,
2266835	2283541	I don't know, Sister of the Traveling Pants 3 in 3D God, let's hope not But I think eventually everything will be in 3D And that's just going to be the way it is And then when you're talking to your kids about how you used to see the 2D movies They're like, 2D?
2283561	2285902	What are you talking about?
2285942	2286842	What is 2D?
2287202	2291384	And that's the time when the 4D dimension will be coming out And you can watch movies in an alternate time
2292385	2297126	This is my issue is that people bitched about TV when it was new.
2298146	2300707	People bitched about HDTV.
2301407	2304308	People bitched when it was time to go from 8-track to cassette.
2304988	2306248	Or VHS to DVD.
2306808	2307349	Exactly.
2307849	2310049	It's the same thing over and over.
2311109	2313230	And it's just sort of like a big inevitability.
2313610	2315451	Technology is going to progress.
2316951	2318211	I gotta play devil's advocate.
2319271	2321532	None of those technologies hurt my eyes.
2324031	2326233	That's the one downside I can see to this 3D.
2326453	2326633	Yeah.
2326693	2331656	Like, even when I go to do the 3D movies and so forth, like, I can't wear the glasses for the whole two hours consecutively.
2331676	2332437	Yeah, but you know why, though?
2332457	2337280	That's because the technology that they have right now, there's a lot of flicker and just... But they're gonna catch up.
2337821	2341143	It's... The technology will get better and it'll be less harsh on your eyes.
2341183	2341583	Okay, that's fair.
2341603	2342504	Well, I mean, think about this.
2342524	2345026	Alright, look at televisions in the 80s.
2345546	2345746	Okay.
2346827	2352589	Remember those big, you know, cabinet televisions that would have that, you know, look like, oh, they're supposed to be nice furniture and shit.
2352970	2354730	A really blurry screen quality.
2355170	2361793	Now we've got TVs that are three times those size in perfect crystal clear HD quality.
2361813	2363934	And we're talking about a span of 25 years.
2365135	2369216	So... So by the time I'm 50, the holodeck should be out, right?
2369596	2370697	No, I'm not saying that.
2370857	2372297	But now also...
2374398	2378283	But if you think about it too, the growth of technology is also exponential.
2381366	2388595	The more technological advancement you get in the different fields, they're going to speed up the new rate of research.
2389115	2390657	The more you learn, the more you're going to learn.
2390817	2391839	That's how I see it.
2392509	2394110	Two very interesting comments in chat.
2394230	2394810	I gotta bring up.
2395150	2399211	Bochikawa in our chatroom says, Besides, we're still playing games on the NES.
2399672	2401032	If you want new, then get new.
2401112	2402613	If you want old, play old.
2403113	2403613	Interesting.
2403933	2404473	Seriously.
2404753	2405994	That's what we do.
2406054	2407614	We've got a whole room full of old.
2407914	2410996	And it's not to say that all technologies end up taking off.
2411156	2411856	Old is new.
2411976	2415477	Look at how much retro crap gets repackaged and comes out.
2415497	2415897	You know what I mean?
2415917	2418618	That's because all the kids have grown up and are making the games.
2418838	2419338	Fascinating.
2419438	2420139	Can you believe...
2421319	2434988	And I don't know if this is on our show or not, but can you believe that copies of Super Mario All-Stars, the reprint that was on the Wii, are selling for $75 and $80 on eBay?
2435288	2435508	Yeah.
2436009	2437410	Are you people fucking nuts?
2438650	2441191	Let me bring this up in chat as well because this is another good comment.
2441211	2442912	And then I promise we can change the topic.
2443652	2447533	Mayor in our chatroom says, why now versus the last 3D?
2448033	2450134	And I think that's a very legitimate question.
2450994	2453995	And I'm guessing a lot of it has to do with the technology.
2454015	2460757	The last time 3D was big was the mid-early 80s when JAWS 3D was out and that stuff.
2461378	2462178	And I'm thinking...
2463919	2465040	There's two reasons for it.
2466041	2469243	A, that technology wasn't as good, period.
2469343	2481212	I mean, when you're talking to 3DS, again, I'm telling you guys, the first time you see it without glasses, you do have that moment of, whoa, everybody's going to have that moment of, whoa, I'm playing this and I'm not wearing glasses and I'm seeing the 3D.
2482373	2485915	And then B, Jaws 3D was not Avatar.
2486656	2491499	And love Avatar or hate it, the fact is it's the highest grossing movie ever.
2492020	2493361	And now everybody wants to be it.
2495061	2497143	Those are the two big differences to me.
2497984	2504531	Technology has come a long way and a movie got to be extremely successful with the technology.
2504571	2508516	Let me tell you that Avatar didn't make its money because people liked the plot.
2508836	2509977	They wanted to see the pretty 3D.
2511201	2526255	Well, but if you also look into the actual technology that went into it, it's basically, and I think they applied some of it to a lesser extent in Tron, remember, with having the 3D modeled younger face, even though he looked like plastic.
2526295	2528978	That technology still needs some work.
2529939	2534403	But I think what they needed was better animation.
2535044	2536105	That's what I think that that needed.
2536445	2538446	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2553915	2555897	For example, I'll use Tron since I was already on it.
2555917	2562042	In the first Tron movie, when he walks into the cubicle area and there's cubicles going on for miles, that was on matte painting.
2563043	2574393	Or remember V when they walked into the ship and it's the whole lines of the storage pods going on in the back in the old one.
2574813	2575774	That was on matte painting.
2576154	2578897	My favorite was always rear projection for driving scenes.
2579077	2579237	Yeah.
2579591	2607614	yeah but now if you look at that you're gonna I don't think that the craftsmanship is going anywhere it's just moving to a different medium you're still gonna have to have animators you're still gonna have to have artists that are gonna be able to make all of this and yeah maybe you're saving in resources and paint and that type of thing and keep in mind I still think nothing will replace painting nothing will replace physical art you know what I mean
2608474	2626819	But at the same time, I think that if you're looking in terms of pushing the envelope as far as the experience that you can deliver in technology, in a cinematic experience, or in games or movies, anything like that, that you're going to have to start making situations where it's cheaper to produce.
2627299	2633141	And I think that that's going to be the advantage of going with the same type of innovations that they made with Avatar.
2633181	2636022	That's what my point was, is the fact that you could have...
2637422	2649606	and then send it off to a team of animators and have this high quality product produced with some time and effort but you're not paying for a set.
2649747	2651547	You're not paying for makeup.
2651927	2652848	None of that.
2654428	2655108	That was my point.
2656269	2659609	That's where I see everything going with the technology developed with that.
2659769	2661430	Yeah, cool movie.
2661910	2665531	But I think that they need to take the same things.
2665691	2668231	Keep in mind, they could even do the same thing with video games.
2668251	2670132	We've had motion capture in video games before.
2671192	2673813	So keep in mind taking that same sort of...
2676667	2689274	you know the blank set you can actually do all of your cinematic cutscenes with like actual actors and record them real time have them you know the layers and everything put over it for a game and boom there you go
2690765	2693186	Let me try to wrap up this topic by going back to one other thought.
2719331	2720672	and DarkSakura.com.
2749627	2756091	All these launch games are kind of like that obvious thing to do the technology.
2756471	2760694	All the Kinect launch games were essentially Wii knockoffs and Dance Central.
2761975	2769019	You know, all the 3DS things are these, you know, Nintendo upgrades and sort of like, you know, finally Kid Icarus coming back and so forth.
2770320	2796438	I'm really curious now what is going to be next now that these technologies are established how are you going to take it to the next level what is that must have game going to have in it that implements that technology that just blows us away so I'm really interested in what's going to be brought to the table this year at E3 and it's either going to be great or it's going to show that you know what we should have never left where we were last year
2798103	2798464	DarkSakura
2810422	2812123	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2833115	2840199	They are now doing the whole, I hate the word term, microtransaction, because a transaction is a transaction.
2841160	2842300	Fuck putting a size on it.
2843241	2848644	But they're using this little, you know, and I can see doing it.
2848724	2851586	I've been doing some of them in Star Trek Online when I was playing.
2852266	2856249	I bought outfits and shit packs and stuff, even with my subscription fee.
2857089	2868731	So I can see that if someone wants to, you know, make, you know, a character look a certain way, they're going to spend all the little bits and pieces and not even see that they're nickel-diming their money right into their pocket.
2869986	2875348	and I've always said the minute this technology comes out for World of Warcraft, Horde House is over, I'm quitting WoW.
2875988	2882510	The minute this type of stuff, and you might already say, oh Rob, you can already do it, the mounts, that's all superficial crap.
2883090	2884411	And you know, it does not affect the base game.
2884431	2885691	When this becomes their model.
2885891	2886511	Exactly.
2886932	2896775	If Warcraft ever implements this stuff where the stats change or you're getting things that otherwise you'd grind dungeons for or whatever, Horde House is cancelled and WoW is done.
2897915	2905218	I like playing a game where everybody's on an equal playing field.
2905818	2907259	Everybody's paying $15 a month.
2908099	2916842	Everybody is on that same playing field when it comes to the quests that you're grinding and so forth, and those that get the super awesome items really worked for it.
2917560	2928206	However, that's not to slam this other idea because, you know, not everything can be wow and not everything can kind of command the $15 up front.
2928826	2933809	And I think we've seen a lot of the same model, oddly enough, in Facebook games and it's worked really well.
2936340	2936720	I don't know.
2936840	2942921	These games, I'm okay with the way they do it because it's sort of like, well, you know nothing in this world is really free.
2943561	2946802	So that's how they choose to nickel and dime you instead of the cost of the game.
2947222	2950463	And so, I don't know, for some reason, I'm okay with it.
2950503	2958644	But at the same time, I can't think of any free-to-play games that I really play with any regularity except one or two Facebook games.
2959264	2963865	That even then, if they were to disappear and delete tomorrow, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.
2964557	2988065	well you keep in mind too that a lot of like remember when I was playing Ragnarok online a lot of the free servers that I would play on they would actually make the money to run the servers by offering special items for people who donated and you know that's been going on for years Second Life that's how they run you know you pay real money for stuff that people have made and
2989945	2990945	That's how you do your thing there.
2991505	3000728	I think that it's just now they're saying that when you don't notice how much you're spending, that it's easier to spend a lot more.
3001948	3002648	If that makes sense.
3003909	3004449	Absolutely.
3004509	3005969	That's gambling.
3006189	3006929	There's a lot of that.
3006949	3010070	And on top of that, you're not dealing with actual physical money.
3010170	3012611	You're dealing with a click yes.
3013451	3016232	There's no money leaving your hand, but it's relieving your bank account.
3016252	3017572	Yeah.
3018396	3019117	It could be dangerous.
3019237	3021959	When Xbox Live first came out, I bought every single arcade game that came out.
3021979	3022459	Freaking iTunes.
3023140	3025862	Yeah, iTunes is easy to fall into that too.
3025882	3026302	Same thing.
3026442	3026723	Oh yeah.
3027603	3028284	So, anyway.
3030202	3031303	Good talks tonight.
3031903	3034845	Speaking of Xbox Live... Keep a ledger by your desk when you play.
3035365	3035986	For real.
3036486	3038387	All right, Loki, what's up next in the news for us?
3038867	3039207	All right.
3039908	3041389	Oops.
3042069	3044671	Anyways, this is kind of cool.
3044691	3046572	They're doing a new promotion.
3046612	3051935	Well, it's kind of something that they've been doing each year for Xbox Live Arcade, the house party.
3052936	3055137	Well, this time they've got a lineup of games coming up.
3055197	3055998	It's actually pretty cool.
3056738	3061443	There's going to be five games that will start coming out on February 18th each week.
3062164	3064146	And it's going to include the following titles.
3064566	3066168	Beyond Good and Evil HD.
3068210	3071153	Hardcore Uprising.
3071193	3073495	That's that Contra game that's kind of anime style now.
3074156	3075277	Bejeweled Blitz Live.
3076078	3077919	Full House Poker Torchlight Xbox Live Arcade
3105962	3108683	I am so excited about Torchlight coming.
3110463	3111063	It's going to be sweet.
3111444	3115805	But it's going to be weird because Torchlight is very PC.
3116405	3117325	You know what I mean?
3117465	3120066	And if you've never played it, it's basically Diablo 2.
3121186	3123627	I don't know how else to explain it.
3123947	3129448	It's a lot of that same kind of like dungeon crawl and lots of keys do different things.
3129788	3134910	And I think they've talked about with this coming Xbox Live Arcade, they've practically revamped the whole battle system.
3135470	3136170	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3164878	3171502	But at the same time, they're going to kind of trick me into buying the same game twice because I have it on PC and now I kind of want it on Xbox Live Arcade.
3171602	3171903	Damn it!
3172243	3172583	Damn it!
3173023	3173524	Exactly.
3173544	3175425	I've been tricked into buying this game twice.
3175945	3176826	What about you, chatters?
3177106	3182569	Any of you guys play Torchlight on your PC and yet you think you're going to buy this on Xbox Live Arcade as well?
3182589	3184851	That's what I'm curious about.
3186570	3188071	What were some of the other games that were coming out?
3188552	3189893	It's all Torchlight Torchlight to me.
3190293	3192855	But Jewel Blitz Live.
3193436	3194056	They have that.
3194597	3196198	That game's free to play on Facebook.
3196218	3197859	They're going to charge me to play it on Xbox Live?
3198440	3198840	Yes.
3198860	3199420	Bastards.
3200441	3201622	Beyond Good and Evil HD.
3201782	3204004	I know a lot of people are Beyond Good and Evil fans.
3204044	3204965	Yeah, that'll be a big one.
3207247	3207507	What else?
3207787	3209088	Oh, there's that new poker game.
3209268	3210870	That was from Microsoft.
3211170	3213091	Oh, that's the one versus 100 replacement, isn't it?
3213232	3213472	Yes.
3213492	3213712	Yes.
3216318	3218979	Bochikawa in our chatroom says, Torchlight with Kinect support?
3219099	3220240	That might be really fun.
3221000	3222700	I don't think it uses Kinect.
3223040	3223601	I don't think so either.
3223621	3226722	That's an interesting thought, though, is that what if instead of a mouse, it was your hand?
3227242	3232323	And you could just move your hand around and click by, like, just thrusting your hand forward or something?
3232363	3232723	I don't know.
3232863	3233464	It'd be interesting.
3234504	3237485	Dartetsuya reminded us that Diablo was on the PlayStation.
3237665	3239205	Look at how Diablo worked on the PlayStation.
3239225	3241006	They just changed the controls to work with a controller.
3241431	3243732	Activision Blizzard, and Zynga
3273750	3277572	What do these two companies possibly have in common where they're both being sued?
3277933	3285356	Well, Walker Digital, which was founded by Jay Walker, who also made Priceline.com, is behind this suit.
3285416	3286997	So maybe it's not just any old troll.
3287037	3289338	This is a troll with a big website.
3289859	3297903	Zynga and Activision violate the patent, which is a database-driven online distributed tournament system.
3299840	3324998	Walker is saying that the part of this that has been violated is the part of the patent that says there is a quote method of conducting a distributed electronic tournament for a plurality of players and World of Warcraft, Call of Duty Black Ops which is Activision which is part of Blizzard, Mafia Wars and all these games have these tournaments in them
3325598	3330582	Kind of odd that StarCraft isn't mentioned because when I think tournaments, I don't think WoW, I think StarCraft, but whatever.
3332564	3334245	I guess violates this patent.
3336863	3341246	I don't know, I'm starting to think with all these stories I read that patent stuff is a need for reform.
3341526	3344327	I think whatever judge reviews that needs to just tell him to bite his ass.
3344347	3347469	Well, and it probably will get laughed out of court, as a lot of these recent ones have.
3347489	3349691	But they're asking for a full trial or whatever.
3349771	3350171	And you know what?
3350291	3353733	If this guy had the technology years ago or whatever, that's fine.
3353793	3359636	If you were the one that thought of it, I guess, although I somehow don't think these companies have implemented it quite the same way.
3360397	3361558	And just the fact that...
3362538	3364519	Why do you patent something and then do nothing with it?
3364719	3365759	That's what bothers.
3367060	3373682	That's what makes you look like a troll, is you're just waiting for someone to actually put a good idea to use, and then you get to sue the pants off of them.
3374842	3375223	I don't know.
3375983	3380184	A little silly to me, and I'm sure it's a little silly to all of you as well.
3381605	3382825	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
3384186	3385446	Oh, I've got a few other things.
3386386	3387687	How about Mario All-Stars?
3389858	3391498	Well, it sold out.
3392219	3393839	And copies are going for $80 on eBay.
3394639	3396060	And they're talking about more reprints.
3397060	3398180	So we might be seeing it going.
3398260	3399700	However, they have not sold out in the UK.
3401141	3405922	And you can still get your copy on Amazon UK for $17.99.
3407402	3409383	So people in Europe, stockpile.
3410743	3412443	Because we're coming after your supply.
3412724	3418665	And people here in the US, you're going to be really sorry buying these for $80 on eBay if they end up reprinting them, which they probably will.
3419366	3431090	Well, yeah, I mean, basically, Mark Franklin, who's the head of Nintendo PR, said that they're thinking about bringing it back in reprints.
3432931	3435092	So they definitely want to make more money, and people will buy them.
3436012	3436712	The market's there.
3437833	3441694	And I'm sure there's got to be a lot of us sitting here going, who is buying this?
3441854	3446536	Because seriously... It's a port of a game that was out on the SNES.
3446676	3446896	I mean...
3447369	3448190	Well, here's this.
3448930	3452373	Dan turned to me a while back and said, Hey, you want this game?
3452654	3452854	Why?
3452894	3453875	We've got it on the SNES.
3455136	3460821	I mean, I think we were talking about wanting the special edition or something because it came with shit, but why?
3461451	3464272	I guarantee that you can buy a Super Nintendo and the game for less than $80.
3464352	3465013	Oh no, I'm sure you can.
3491356	3492877	The game is easy to find.
3493077	3497740	I mean, it wasn't like of super limited production or anything, but you can find them.
3498100	3500121	Most people don't understand that.
3500241	3501222	I think I've got two copies.
3501262	3501962	It's the Wii.
3502382	3503983	If I have another copy, I'll send it to somebody.
3504643	3510367	I know this is hard for people that listen to this show to understand because you all are very gaming aware.
3510387	3512308	You're culturally aware of the gaming community.
3512768	3516310	I think there's a lot of people out there that honestly don't understand that.
3516750	3526717	they don't think you can buy Super Nintendos anymore or they think that well it's on the Wii it's a Wii version it's different no it's not they don't know that
3528226	3529887	All they know is that the game is on the Wii now.
3530327	3532688	We are expert analysts of video games.
3533168	3533748	Trust us.
3534449	3535289	It's the same thing.
3535409	3539831	It's like when they re-released The Wizard of Oz into theaters for a limited run.
3540531	3543232	It's the same damn movie.
3543432	3544573	They didn't put anything back.
3545093	3547874	Dorothy suddenly does not go home.
3547934	3548474	You know what I mean?
3548514	3550015	She still clicks her heels three times.
3550035	3551135	That'd be fucking hilarious.
3551616	3552556	Change the ending.
3552936	3554597	But no, the movie is still the same.
3554957	3555477	You know what I mean?
3555837	3556698	Nothing's changed.
3557738	3562861	They changed the ending and she's actually in the insane asylum like in the second movie.
3563041	3566103	I honestly truly think people don't know that you can go out and still buy the game.
3566163	3570185	They think that, oh, they've re-released this now and I can get it on my Wii for my kids.
3570625	3572186	They should be listening to our podcast.
3573287	3573907	Why aren't they?
3574989	3576950	and some folks in the chat room seem to agree with me.
3576990	3582192	Tigerclaw says, true, and people who never bought a Mario game in their life, this will be their first entry to Mario.
3582632	3587654	DDRDollarBill says, here's the thing, casual players aren't going to go out and find a Super Nintendo and then find the games.
3588774	3590475	They don't know how to hunt at a free market.
3590895	3591135	I know.
3591355	3591735	Lazy.
3591895	3593756	Nintendo is taking advantage of lazy people.
3596822	3600584	Every industry out there takes advantage of people being lazy.
3602565	3603925	Infomercials exist.
3604205	3611489	They create problems for people that people didn't have before so that they can sell them a product for a problem they didn't have.
3612028	3618713	Thank you for reminding me because I actually have a problem with my cat not being able to get high enough on our windows so I had to go buy a sunny seat for it.
3620154	3620995	Your cat can live.
3621055	3621595	It's a cat.
3622296	3624077	She needs to be higher up on the window.
3624237	3626059	Shermie sits on the damn floor.
3626119	3627220	Cats desire height.
3627320	3629982	When she wants sunlight, she goes and sits in front of the door.
3630653	3659116	I think some of the greatest company ideas out there are formed on how can I allow people to be more lazy like let me give you an example there's companies out there that will do takeout for any type of food and they just charge like a surcharge we have something called takeout taxi yeah any restaurant in the world and get you takeout food now here's the thing not everybody who uses that is lazy because certainly you have homebound people sick people people who don't have driver's license people who are studying for their finals yeah exactly
3659716	3662718	But I'll betcha that's 10% of who's using it.
3663159	3663419	Oh yeah.
3664460	3665140	No, I understand.
3666922	3671085	It's just, you know, I don't want to start ranting again.
3671165	3671565	Forget it.
3671726	3672766	No, please, rant.
3672806	3674948	We haven't had good rants in a long time on this show.
3675028	3679992	Why can't people just get off their asses and just put effort into shit, you know?
3680012	3686337	Because then I have to look away from my farm and my plants on my farmville will die.
3686537	3688619	I was just ranting, Rob.
3691364	3698370	Nothing is going to equal the experience of sitting down and playing the game on the Super Nintendo with the right controller.
3699210	3700872	It's just not going to be the same.
3703774	3706156	That's the whole reason why we didn't get the new Donkey Kong, Rob.
3706536	3708037	It's because you can't play it with a classic controller.
3709418	3710279	It's not Donkey Kong.
3711880	3713361	You have to do the little shaky thing.
3714042	3715583	They didn't want to put motion control in it.
3715643	3716324	Miyamoto made them.
3718297	3719118	That's retarded.
3720298	3722700	I want to sit down and play a game that doesn't have motion control.
3723640	3728163	And I want to wear my pajamas while I'm doing it so I can be lazy playing it the way it's meant to be played.
3729964	3731365	So I'll go to effort to be lazy.
3732085	3735827	You know what's a really interesting comment here from Xlink in our chat room?
3736348	3737829	Netflix is another company.
3738589	3744553	And he didn't really put context to that, so I'm assuming it means Netflix kind of made their money off lazy things.
3745113	3745713	But I don't know.
3745793	3745993	Like...
3747194	3752799	I can definitely see that end of it, but I don't know if I'd necessarily call it lazy as much as it is damn convenient.
3753939	3756441	Because what did we have to do before?
3756481	3759444	You had to get out, get in your car, go to the video store, and so forth.
3760064	3763127	It's more convenience, in my opinion.
3763167	3765909	It's also kind of the subscriber fee.
3765929	3773455	When Blockbuster had their stores, not until the end, after Netflix was out, did they have these monthly fees where you could rent all the movies you wanted.
3775136	3777358	That's why people like Netflix from what I understood.
3777378	3780321	They could send one movie away and there'd be another one waiting for them.
3780461	3786607	I can kind of take that going to Blockbuster out of my daily routine and watch more movies.
3787187	3789249	I don't know if I would call that lazy, though.
3790490	3792712	I mean, I guess it is in a way.
3793673	3795715	People are convenience-centric.
3796976	3798638	They're focused on convenience.
3799378	3799478	And
3801199	3812412	I kind of miss going to Blockbuster and looking at the movies and reading the backs of them and everything and going to rent my games and the special rental only versions of stuff.
3812452	3817017	Well, there's still like one Blockbuster in every town if you want to do that.
3817658	3818859	It's just farther away now.
3819375	3820676	and the fucking Redbox thing.
3821516	3822377	I hate the Redbox.
3823638	3827120	That's why my husband doesn't have a job as a freaking Redbox.
3827820	3828260	Hate it.
3828921	3830582	I'm not really a big fan of Redbox either.
3831733	3838238	Like, in my opinion, you should go out to a blockbuster if you're going to use something like Redbox.
3838318	3839358	It's not that different.
3839658	3846323	And this is what the other problem is, too, is that I think that there's a sort of forced isolation going on people, you know?
3846843	3856090	It used to be you had to get out and be in society and be a part of things, but now it's like, everyone's an individual and we have to cater to everybody and...
3856970	3858351	Political Correct, and blah, blah, blah.
3859032	3864255	And I think that it's a matter of you're removing the human element from the equation.
3865276	3866997	Ooh, good point from Frisbee in our chat room.
3867057	3868798	Netflix eliminated the late fees.
3868878	3870219	That's why it got so popular.
3870339	3871259	That's a very good point.
3872140	3873601	But do you see what I mean?
3873641	3874101	No, I do.
3874882	3875142	I do.
3875162	3876162	I have to make sure our chatters.
3876262	3877143	Every gamer has a voice.
3877203	3877803	I gotta get their voice.
3877823	3881446	For example, even with World of Warcraft, going back to that, you're...
3883072	3884113	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3898730	3901771	See, I like to do both, but sometimes it's not practical.
3901791	3902632	You know what I mean?
3902652	3906433	Like sometimes I'm playing these games with people that live halfway across the country, all the way across the country.
3906453	3907034	That's fine.
3907074	3907694	That's one thing.
3907734	3911896	But I'm saying how many people in the guild live in town or near town?
3912616	3915017	I mean, that's, you know, one point.
3915777	3921400	It used to be that we would, all of us would get together like twice a week and play DDR or go to the arcade and something.
3921420	3922580	And now it's just like, oh, I'll see you online.
3923661	3924541	What happened to hanging out?
3925481	3926742	What happened to good old fashioned hanging out?
3928680	3934051	I think that the other thing with all of this is just that it's removing the personal element from everything.
3934552	3939342	We are a convenience-driven society and we also don't like dealing with people because it's inconvenient.
3941846	3942987	Anyway, more ranting.
3943848	3950073	Yet, yet, there's a stigma in our society that we all need to be skinny and beautiful because only skinny is beautiful.
3950533	3962382	But the realistic end of it is that with how much we are lazy and convenience-driven, it ought to be that sitting at home all day getting really, really...
3963823	3965604	Remember when Big Betts were in?
3965624	3966624	You have that magnet.
3994211	3995732	I like big butts and I cannot lie.
3996233	3997494	You other brothers can't deny.
3997534	3998315	I thought you liked boobs.
3998595	3999436	Alright, let's move on.
3999496	4000177	Release dates.
4000197	4003961	Let's travel around the world and see what is conveniently coming out to a store near you.
4004910	4008314	PC, Playstation 3, Xbox 360 Ghost Trick Phantom Detective Nintendo DS Ace Attorney
4028714	4042367	DC Universe, they're going to have that available on PlayStation 3 and PC, both the regular and collector's editions of those Prinny 2, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude, on PSP What?
4044289	4048853	Say that again Prinny 2, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude
4050680	4054982	Prinnies are the little guys in the Disgaea, little penguin dudes, right?
4055003	4055183	Yes.
4055443	4057924	And this is about Operation Panties?
4058204	4061466	Yes, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.
4063627	4066369	Okay, like what the fuck happened to this series when I wasn't watching it?
4066449	4070271	So like now there's a game coming out where the little penguins are going on a panty raid.
4070471	4071412	Am I correct?
4072433	4073273	I'm not sure.
4073953	4075554	What is Operation Panties?
4075875	4076555	I have no idea.
4076575	4076655	Yeah.
4079147	4079808	Alright, keep going.
4080348	4081369	I need to do some research.
4081869	4083170	Kingdom Hearts Recoded.
4083471	4085532	That's coming out on Nintendo DS this week.
4089496	4095481	Spellforce 2, Faith and Destiny on PC.
4097142	4097843	Let's see...
4101060	4103401	And that's basically it.
4103461	4104942	Next week, lots of good stuff.
4105522	4106623	But that's for next week.
4106923	4108344	Or the week after next, I should say.
4109504	4111865	I want me some LittleBigPlanet 2.
4112045	4116147	There's no wiki entry on Prinny 2, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.
4116888	4119449	I'm trying to find more information on this.
4119669	4120469	I'm doing Google.
4120489	4121010	Give me a minute.
4121790	4122370	Let's see.
4123051	4124931	Okay, there's something on the PlayStation blog.
4124991	4125892	Let's see what this is all about.
4127830	4132072	Printy 2 is a side-scrolling hack-and-slash action game and you can play as Printy.
4132572	4136595	Your mission this time is to find the precious panties of Demon Lord Etna.
4137535	4144038	Yes, you have to search for Etna's panties, or Etna swears that she will skin all printies and make them into panties.
4145179	4148961	Well, now that I think of that, pretty panties would be kind of cool, but not for the printies.
4149761	4155864	You must find her panties by following morning in the game so you don't have any time to dilly-dally.
4155924	4156985	Let's get to it, dude.
4161269	4162610	Words escape me, folks.
4162790	4164510	This is what gaming has become.
4165651	4166531	Look at your life.
4166591	4171093	Look at your choices.
4171253	4171973	What are you doing?
4177275	4179836	Insolacious Pop is chiming in there.
4179976	4182097	Etna, the demon girl, was in Disgaea.
4182117	4185158	Her panties are missing and you fight an action platformer to find them.
4185579	4187559	But with panties, like in Ghosts and Goblins.
4188180	4189340	Ghosts and Goblins and panties.
4192236	4193096	I just, I can't.
4197018	4202421	Although, you know what, this game probably deserves to sell more copies than a lot of the stuff out there.
4202461	4205082	I mean, hooray for them for giving gamers what they really want.
4205162	4205642	Panties.
4206963	4210365	Let's move on to Japan and talk about some of the crazy games coming out over there.
4211385	4215307	On the Xbox 360, Arcana Heart 3 is making its way out this week.
4215367	4217468	Arcana Heart, that's the all chick fighters, right?
4218852	4220813	Alright, number three is coming out.
4221273	4222533	Panties will fly!
4224354	4226035	Or at least they will in my brain.
4226375	4231757	James Bond Bloodstone comes out on 360 this week as well as Mass Effect 2, the Japanese edition.
4232417	4234177	Took them a little while to localize it for those guys.
4234878	4238639	Stoked, Big Air edition also on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
4238999	4244521	And a very limited edition Arcana Heart 3 arcade stick coming out as well.
4246589	4249391	Coming out on the PlayStation 3.
4250452	4253794	Arcana Heart 3 gets a version there as well, and a joystick.
4254074	4258176	And James Bond Bloodstone also coming out on the PlayStation 3 in Japan.
4258677	4260378	So the releases kind of mirror each other there.
4260838	4262179	Nothing on the Wii this week.
4262219	4268103	In fact, things are kind of quiet from Nintendo until we get to the last story in a couple weeks.
4268143	4271725	And then, of course, Nintendo's going to be all about the 3DS in Japan in just a little bit.
4272065	4272545	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4298813	4313338	This game is like that old game Go, but with one of the world's experts, who's this kind of cute chick in her cyber form helping you to play that old game.
4314558	4316379	Does she strip down naked if I do well?
4316399	4317619	It's not strip Go.
4317759	4318759	Get your mind out of the gutter.
4319520	4320380	Not interested.
4320600	4326162	Also, Black Robina comes out this week from one of my favorite named companies over there.
4326182	4326462	Broccoli.
4326482	4326982	Broccoli.
4329011	4329491	You know what else?
4329532	4330072	Broccoli did.
4330232	4330592	What else?
4330773	4331273	DigiCarrot.
4332154	4332274	Ah.
4333495	4335757	Well, they're doing Black Robina on the PSP this week.
4335797	4337018	That's it for Japanese releases.
4338099	4340181	Well, for Europe, there's a few.
4340881	4344825	We have Zite on Xbox 360 for the 12th.
4345285	4348548	On the 14th is DC Universe Online and Ghost Trick.
4349129	4350630	And also Kingdom Hearts Recoded.
4351691	4352812	And that's it.
4354775	4358643	Alright, we're almost to the classic game of the week, but first, a couple more stories for you guys.
4359224	4362852	And this next story, you're going to want to remember this when we get into Part B tonight.
4363513	4372823	Yes, THQ has partnered with Mattel and they're going to be doing some brand new licensed games based on their properties.
4373403	4382393	And of course, some of the deals that they have in place already, well, they've already got some stuff, I guess.
4383934	4386197	He-Man by the power of Greyskull.
4387927	4389510	So that's kind of cool.
4390132	4395403	And then they haven't really said what other rights they're also going to be working with.
4395463	4395683	I guess...
4397602	4425067	let's see here they said Barbie, Hot Wheels it's kind of odd because Barbie and Hot Wheels right now Activision kind of has the rights to those because they've been making games for them for a while now mainly the Barbie stuff off of the DVD movies if you believe it or not they keep releasing DVD movies for Barbie stuff Fisher Price, Rock'em Sock'em Robots Masters of the Universe and Polly Pocket um
4426880	4448889	and of course, you know, people are wondering also, they're gonna be maybe doing some tie-ins with the U-Draw game tablet, because they do have that by the way so I don't know, it's interesting I wonder if they're gonna be doing any off the new Masters of the Universe series is that even still around?
4450789	4452150	do they show it in reruns?
4452210	4454871	weren't they supposed to be opting a new movie or something for that?
4455987	4457551	Well, Dolph Lundgren needs more work.
4459495	4460798	I'm serious, man.
4460979	4462322	Isn't he like senile by now?
4462362	4463464	He's got to be getting pretty old.
4464066	4465349	He was in Expendables.
4465489	4466271	He's not that old.
4466638	4468519	Well, Expendables was different though.
4468560	4470201	It brought back everybody for that movie.
4470841	4472002	And they're all pretty old.
4472583	4472823	Alright.
4473563	4475485	One more story for you guys, then the classic game of the week.
4476105	4487374	And this has to do with some big announcements at Consumer Electronics Show this week, which usually isn't a gaming show per se, but a few things will always get slipped in there because of course gaming consoles are what's in your living room.
4488214	4515928	and one place that gaming consoles have really expanded beyond just the place you play video games is being an entertainment device letting you watch movies and Netflix on them and Microsoft talked a little bit about Netflix expansion coming this spring Netflix will get Kinect enabled so you'll be able to flail your arms to queue up episodes of Veronica Mars if that's how you choose to do it I bet this will be one of those things where you use it a couple times to impress your friends and then you're done with it
4516348	4517388	Thanks for watching!
4541153	4542374	Maybe next year's CES.
4542434	4542735	Who knows?
4543335	4546618	Also announced, though, is that Hulu will be coming to Xbox.
4546758	4552764	It's out on the PlayStation, but Hulu Plus will be coming to the Xbox 360 at the same time later this spring.
4553284	4553985	So there you go.
4554806	4556988	One other little tidbit that was dropped in the press conference.
4557668	4562833	Remember how Microsoft had a goal of selling 5 million Kinect units by Christmas?
4563273	4567057	Well, they came out at CES and said they sold 8 million units.
4567637	4575722	But some people have said, wait a minute, did you really sell 8 million units or did you push 8 million units out there to retailers?
4576383	4576903	Hmm.
4577563	4581966	Well, regardless of however the numbers are being skewed, it still is a fairly impressive amount.
4581986	4587450	I guarantee if they, I think those are sold numbers because they haven't been sitting on shelves.
4587750	4588390	Let me put it that way.
4588590	4589371	They're hard to find.
4590842	4593724	So, yeah, and who knew?
4593985	4601391	A lot of people thought that that was going to be a high number for them to break because that's way more than they sold 360s in the first year.
4601411	4605174	Of course, 360s were really hard to get at that time, so I don't know.
4605374	4606395	These are still hard to get.
4607335	4607896	Are they really?
4608737	4609497	I guess I'm spoiled.
4609597	4610838	It seems that way at least.
4611399	4612620	Probably not for retailers.
4613020	4615862	It's pretty easy to get for them.
4615882	4616623	Yeah.
4616903	4624150	I like how everybody in our chatroom at chat.orangenetradio.com is coming out with their own ideas for what Kinect should do on voice command.
4624190	4627533	Like DDR Dollar Bill says, Kinect, get me a beer.
4628754	4631756	Frisbee in our chatroom says, computer, end holodeck.
4633998	4638422	DDR Dollar Bill says, Kinect, ban this douchebag who called me a racial slur.
4641165	4642326	Someday, someday.
4643973	4646596	TigerClaw, Xbox, play Tron.
4647117	4647637	Tron.
4647878	4648118	Tron.
4648158	4649199	I said Tron, damn it.
4649540	4651562	Yeah, it would be like the voice recognition on the DS.
4652043	4652503	Blue.
4653665	4654346	Blue.
4655247	4655647	Brew.
4658772	4659673	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4678072	4696708	you should put down all those newfangled holiday toys and your 3DSs and play games the way we used to when we had to walk barefoot through the snow both ways 20 miles up the river and eat our grape nuts to play these games I'm still hungry Rob, all I've had is pizza
4697816	4700117	Alright, what is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
4700237	4701117	Space Fury.
4701797	4704918	Specifically, Space Fury on the ColecoVision.
4705978	4708539	You have to play a little bit of, you have to play the opening taunt.
4708679	4709459	I love that music.
4709779	4710099	Okay.
4711080	4713300	So this is the screen where you select your difficulty.
4725336	4725616	DarkSakura.com
4740996	4743858	It was put out by Sega on June 17th, 1981.
4743978	4749261	It has a rotate left, rotate right, and thrust and fire.
4749921	4760027	So basically, it kind of plays like Asteroids, but as you go through the game, you actually can get a little armored unit that takes you into different levels of different things you can shoot.
4760487	4769792	Except that these little segments combine into a bigger segment, and then you have to blow up the smaller segments and stuff, but they can blow you up.
4769992	4773613	It looks like a little bit Time Pilot, which kind of was Asteroids-inspired, too.
4773633	4776014	It's kind of like between the two.
4776394	4778634	As far as the arcade, the arcade version was Vector.
4779054	4780455	So, of course, this one's not Vector.
4782075	4789217	But the arcade version, it was Vector on an XY monitor, and it ran on the Sega G80 arcade system.
4789237	4794779	It had some of the best lines in it, like, So, a creature for my amusement, prepare for battle!
4796819	4800861	And my favorite one is... And I keep in mind, my mother was great at this game.
4800981	4802802	She played a lot of freaking Space Fury.
4804283	4810226	But, like, when you win the game, basically the last thing that you get is, Our battle has concluded, warrior.
4810306	4812327	You were a stimulating opponent.
4813848	4818410	And the alien in this also appears in a video game called Zector.
4819131	4824013	Now, for the Clicovision version, of course, it's sprite-based.
4824214	4824874	It's, you know...
4827083	4829144	Really, really early video game system.
4829164	4830405	I don't know what else I can say about that.
4831426	4840571	But you use the little... Because it had the keypad controller, so you'd actually thrust and go with your little side shoulders and fire that the same way.
4841632	4843333	And move around.
4843353	4844853	It was actually kind of hard to control.
4845394	4850217	I was not good at this game, but like I said, a lot of this game happened in my house.
4851077	4854659	And you can get power-ups for shooting and get extra...
4861644	4867806	I love this game and I played it on the ColecoVision actually.
4867826	4870307	It was one of the games I really enjoyed playing.
4870327	4872467	I never had a ColecoVision growing up.
4873208	4873708	I've got two.
4873748	4874448	You want to borrow one?
4875248	4876429	I'm not growing up anymore.
4877289	4878129	Oh, come on, Rob.
4878169	4879349	We know you're still growing up.
4880130	4880490	I am.
4883371	4884471	This is when it talked to you.
4886492	4887672	The voice is so realistic.
4890936	4892379	Bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep
4901303	4905284	All right, your classic game of the week this week is Space Fury.
4906124	4909105	Good pick, even if it's not one I'm super familiar with.
4909165	4912226	It looked very interesting, so I will have to check it out this week.
4912246	4913687	I think I've already done GORF, haven't I?
4914027	4914747	I'm sure you have.
4914787	4915207	I'm sure you have.
4915587	4917708	All right, we're going to take a quick break, guys, but don't go anywhere.
4917728	4920689	We're going to be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio in Part B tonight.
4921009	4929351	We're going to do some quick, quick news, including some news on what's going on with APB, Bionic Commando Rearm 2 we got some news on,
4929851	4941396	We're going to get some other news stories tonight about the Mac App Store, of course, your Twitter topics, the mailbag, and because DarkSakura specifically asked for it before the show started tonight, we're going to do a list list tonight.
4941817	4945138	I hope you were paying attention in part A because it has to do with what our list list is about.
4945478	4949160	We'll tell you all about that when we come right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4955359	4958202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
4976721	4977501	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4997290	5000071	Well, not soon, but it will come out and that will be a must-have.
5000551	5003593	But Blu-rays that came out recently that I need to see.
5003733	5004833	I still have not seen this movie.
5004853	5005333	Can you believe it?
5005473	5005934	Inception?
5006914	5008175	I still haven't seen it and I need to.
5008375	5009575	You do need to see that.
5009595	5010456	That is pretty awesome.
5010496	5012316	I've heard nothing but great things about that movie.
5012356	5015097	And now that the Blu-ray is out, I'm going to need to see that.
5015678	5018019	It is absolutely something you should see.
5018839	5021540	That was something else I missed in D-Box.
5021880	5023341	That would have been a good movie in D-Box.
5025955	5026415	Oh, really?
5027376	5029759	Well, D-Box is kind of really, really new, isn't it?
5029799	5030799	It's really, really new, yeah.
5030820	5033422	The theater out here that has it is brand spanking new.
5033702	5038687	It's brand spanking new, and it's only in one theater, and it's only one row of seats.
5039247	5041730	There's two rows of seats in the theater I was in.
5042030	5043391	Oh, then maybe it is two rows.
5043752	5044512	I thought it was just one.
5045573	5047215	But yeah, it's only one theater that they have it in.
5047876	5048356	Very limited.
5049597	5049937	It's fun.
5050117	5051658	It's one of 30 theaters that has it.
5051838	5055360	And that's, of course, the seats that move, the little motion seats that, you know.
5056020	5057280	But it's fun.
5057741	5059861	It's completely unnecessary for a lot of movies.
5060062	5063623	Like, the only movie I've seen in D-Box was the Resident Evil movie.
5063643	5070246	And honestly, I'm not a fan of the Resident Evil series and stuff, but that movie is so far away from the Resident Evil game series.
5070306	5071807	It's more of, like, The Matrix now.
5072027	5072167	Right.
5073087	5074028	It was still pretty cool.
5074408	5079711	And I think with Tron, though, just even watching Tron the first time around, it's going to be awesome with the D-Box stuff.
5080312	5081433	I'm really looking forward to it.
5081473	5082353	Let us know when you're going.
5082913	5085375	I even think, though... Probably Wednesday during the day.
5085415	5088357	I'm glad I did the D-Box thing, but it was a little silly.
5088897	5089858	It was a little silly.
5090598	5091919	But it's cool to say you did it.
5091939	5092900	Which movie did you do it for?
5093000	5093340	Tron.
5093520	5093921	Oh, you did?
5094061	5094281	Yeah.
5094761	5095542	When's Hot Christmas Eve?
5095862	5096682	Oh, did you like it?
5097223	5097423	It was...
5099404	5103707	Because I really like Tron, yes, but it was a little unnecessary and it was kind of expensive.
5105068	5108210	Don't expect to get just thrown around in the seats because that ain't happening.
5108250	5115456	I mean, you can adjust the intensity of it, but I would compare it a little more to Captain EO where the movements in the seat are very subtle.
5115476	5117557	There's a lot of the flying stuff in there.
5117577	5118578	I thought that would be pretty cool.
5119258	5120079	Some of it's kind of neat.
5120319	5121640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5144594	5169450	I think yeah or that they have to make it like pitch pitch black in there which they can't you know that's what they do on things like star tours and stuff to kind of take you out of that but uh yeah you know they can't do that for emergency reasons and for people want to leave to go to the bathroom so uh yeah I think D-Box still has some tweaking that they need to do but it was you know what it was fun save up save up like the eight grand or whatever get a home unit
5170666	5174847	Defective Candy in our chatroom says So a D-Box is like Honey I Shrunk the Audience at Disney
5190971	5192592	No, because those chairs don't move.
5192612	5193733	The movie's a lot better, too.
5194634	5196215	Because Honey, I Shrunk the Audience was terrible.
5196235	5199137	Well, those seats don't move, though, in Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.
5199157	5199577	A little bit.
5199697	5201218	They do a little bit.
5201318	5203760	And I liked that because Eric Idle was in it.
5203780	5207823	There's a part when the baby picks up the audience and does this thing.
5208303	5209664	You gotta admit, that part was pretty cool.
5210273	5211834	Yeah, but the movie itself was dopey.
5212474	5213494	Yeah, it was.
5213594	5215095	It really outstayed its welcome.
5215135	5217716	I mean, when was the last time they made a honey-eye blank the kids?
5217756	5220777	Well, you know, I had to say because Eric Idle was in it.
5221018	5223759	I am really sad that Rick Moranis is not getting more work.
5224159	5224979	I mean, seriously.
5226080	5227280	That was by his choice, I believe.
5227300	5228821	I believe he retired to raise his children.
5229281	5230722	Okay, well, then props to him.
5230802	5232782	Once you make Strange Brew, you can retire.
5233123	5234483	That's what it is, I guess.
5235283	5237084	All right.
5237104	5238865	I still think his best movie was My Blue Heaven.
5239844	5242205	DarkSakura does a side podcast with her friends Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.
5267858	5268759	Comic Insanity
5291986	5292266	Awesome.
5292946	5294087	And you have to listen to it.
5294527	5297068	If you're a loyal OLR listener, you have to listen to that too.
5297868	5299189	And you should also listen to Horde House.
5299589	5302390	Even if you don't play WoW, you can hear Extover make dick and fart jokes.
5303310	5307012	Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth, tapes on Thursdays typically.
5307472	5310513	We don't want to be held to that, but usually if we don't do Thursday, we'll do Friday.
5311093	5315155	So later in the week is when we do our show and we put it right up on iTunes so you folks can grab that.
5315575	5316755	And yeah, it's a fun show.
5316775	5321057	We always have a third random guest and DarkSakura has made it known she wants to come on and be that guest.
5321477	5323077	So we're going to work her into a future episode.
5323437	5324738	Sadly, won't happen this week.
5325058	5328159	We're having our gala 10th episode special this week.
5328419	5328979	A look back.
5328999	5329659	10th anniversary?
5329859	5333620	Yes, a look back at 10 hilarious episodes of The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.
5333640	5334220	It'll be a good time.
5334760	5337501	And very self-serving because that's what anniversary podcasts should be.
5337741	5339381	Because we're making a big, big deal for our team.
5339401	5343642	Like, I'm telling you, the 10th episode of Horde House is a much bigger deal than 400 episodes of OLR.
5343682	5348243	I mean, I'm sorry, but that's just... It's a joke, DarkSakura.
5348423	5348663	Get it?
5349153	5376489	I'm eating Alright, let's get to some rapid fire news I can't make weird faces at you when I'm doing chipmunk cheeks We don't have a website by the way We're not on Infamous.net and we're not even on OrangeLaunchRadio.com We have a blog spot and really that's just the shell for the podcast feed Also We don't have a website right now Before we forget, Geek Life Go to geek-life.com, we're having a comic book giveaway So go in there and read about it
5377625	5385920	And by the way, speaking of Geek Life, Maren Marvel, who runs that and who has filled in for me on this very program, she was on episode 8 of Horde House, not this week's, but last week's episode.
5385940	5386842	She did a phenomenal job.
5387163	5389086	So if you haven't heard that episode of Horde House, you should go listen to it.
5389507	5390308	She did a very good job.
5391621	5402565	All right, let's go to some rapid-fire news, some of the news stories that we just didn't find the long amounts of time to talk about in other parts of the show, but we wanted to talk about them anyway.
5403865	5405246	APB reloaded.
5405706	5406927	They're doing a beta for it.
5407007	5410388	How ironic, because I actually participated in the original APB beta.
5411829	5416194	If you're interested in that, they're going to be starting the closed beta in February.
5416695	5422721	The official Twitter account, APB Reloaded, has more information on that.
5423422	5428047	Apparently, you can sign up on the official website.
5432285	5439012	It is, of course, going to be free to play when it finally launches, unlike the original APB.
5439693	5441795	I didn't think APB was that bad of a game.
5442957	5447262	I thought it was actually pretty cool, but unfortunately it didn't last too long.
5447982	5450345	Definitely worth checking out, especially since it's going to be free to play.
5452189	5455432	The PSP Go has been hacked, not surprisingly.
5456913	5465860	The brand new, I guess, firmware 6.31 and 6.35 have a new homebrew enabler for them.
5466660	5478870	And using this homebrew enabler, you're actually able to load the Prometheus ISO loader, which for those who don't know, it loads dumps of different PSP games.
5479250	5496535	and, of course, the PSP game to show off your hack would be Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, the PSP game that does not have a digital version of it on the PlayStation Network store, pissing off people that own a PSP Go.
5497355	5506058	And, of course, this homebrew enabler doesn't really require any sort of tricks to get it to work, so that's...
5506718	5509920	Not good news for Sony, but I'm sure they'll try to find a way to patch that out.
5512242	5520608	And then finally, there's a couple games in this series that have been available on the iOS store.
5522269	5530715	Of course, the Japanese App Store, or if you have a jailbroken iPhone or iPod, you can also find these available as well.
5531516	5535522	Um, it's a game dev story, and of course there's game dev story 2.
5536264	5542173	Well now there's a brand new game that they have coming out called, uh, Why Why the Game Dealer.
5542674	5544337	And it's basically, um...
5545916	5572149	a game retail store sim and the game dealer you assume the role of a game store boss who must manage employees and please customers all while balancing the stock portfolio of game development studios and apparently also be able to offer customers food and shoo away mall rats from the free food mini games that's funny um
5574330	5578349	The Game Dealer is available on the Japanese App Store right now.
5580290	5581151	That sounds like fun.
5582171	5584753	That's real life for a lot of people that listen to this show, I'm sure.
5585113	5585353	Yeah.
5586614	5586914	Awesome.
5587195	5591377	All right, let's go to Rock Band and what is coming out this week in Rock Band.
5591397	5592938	They're still kicking along with new releases.
5593539	5599443	Although this is a new release, I'm going to take a big fat pass on, but maybe some of you out there are into this.
5600063	5603065	Linkin Park Pack comes out this week, January 11th.
5603505	5605607	Crawling, In the End, Numb...
5606107	5609548	Somewhere I Belong, Waiting for the End, and What I've Done.
5609728	5615951	All those songs are coming out for either 160 Microsoft points, 200 Wii points, or $1.99 on the PlayStation Store.
5616431	5621953	You can also get some pro guitar or bass expansions for the song In the End and What I've Done.
5622353	5624654	Again, if you like Linkin Park, that is.
5625994	5634139	If you are a fan of Elder Scrolls and you're just sitting there tapping your fingers waiting for Skyrim to come out, well, maybe now is a good time to go back and visit Morrowind.
5634499	5636980	There's a brand new mod that just came out called Morrowind 2011.
5638581	5647186	Morrowind 2011 was a mod that was released last week, and it basically makes Morrowind just even more gorgeous than it was originally.
5647226	5650508	Because remember Morrowind, I mean, for the time it was awesome graphics, but
5650928	5652249	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5678105	5685448	The author who originally made this whole expansion, he talked about it on his blog, which is at morowind2011.wordpress.com.
5686008	5694652	He said, quote, In the end, I'm just very disappointed that I wasn't given a chance to correct the issues with the package, as I knew there were issues that were in the process of being fixed or updated.
5694952	5698974	But the file is out on the internet, and it will be very hard for anyone to remove it from all the sites.
5700835	5705497	Anyhow, one other thing, and I'm very excited about this, the Facebook Civilization game.
5705517	5707318	That's right, I'm getting excited about a Facebook game.
5707338	5708239	What are you going to do about it?
5708259	5712261	Civilization World starts its alpha testing phase on January 12th.
5712561	5720085	You can go sign up for it now, but it was a little weird because I guess you need to have a team name and all this other stuff.
5720345	5721565	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
5745484	5750826	More stuff, and some weird stuff among it, but including this weird-ass mustache.
5751946	5752787	And I'll get into that.
5753207	5761470	Basically, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 is coming out, along with an extra mustache on the dude, and jumping!
5762631	5765352	It will be on PlayStation Network on Tuesday, February 1st.
5765392	5765632	It'll be $15.
5766012	5770233	And then the next day it will be on Xbox Live Arcade for 1,200 Microsoft points.
5772815	5776740	Challenge Rooms, and Mustache Sailor Moon
5789364	5794887	Well, Sailor Moon is having a new DS game come out in Italy.
5796288	5799730	Namco Bandai Europe is bringing the first Sailor Moon DS game.
5801210	5805112	And it's the second Sailor Moon game that's being released outside of Japan.
5806033	5812516	And it's called La Luna Splenda, which, yeah, very Sailor Mooney.
5813917	5825066	and they're saying it's adventure, fantasy, fun, action these are the watchwords for next spring yeah the last Sailor Moon game that I had was on the Super Nintendo
5826668	5832270	and trailers for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 reveal two more characters.
5833450	5836291	And one of them, I saw coming.
5836331	5837351	The other one, I'm like, why?
5838211	5839072	Even though it is cool.
5839272	5840492	Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely cool.
5840872	5847914	The first one we get is Hagar from Final Fight and Saturday Night Slam Masters.
5848714	5849814	That game was so awesome.
5850095	5851595	I wish we could get that on the Xbox Live Arcade.
5852580	5853561	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5878118	5879919	This game is out, what, next month, is it?
5880039	5880699	I can't remember.
5881560	5882860	I get my release dates all mixed up.
5883001	5883761	That's going to be exciting.
5883781	5884381	It's pretty cool.
5884841	5885202	All right.
5885942	5887363	Well, is that it for the Rapid Fire News?
5887603	5887863	Yarp.
5887943	5891365	Then we will get into the Twitter topics for tonight.
5891385	5898628	I'm going to go to the tweeters, twitter.com slash OLR, where you show us your tweets every Sunday night here on this program.
5900157	5901338	www.streetfighter.com
5915815	5923700	I guess they have actually kind of used the editor mode to make like Ken and Vega and Blanca, Dhalsim.
5924541	5926442	Somebody having fun with the editor mode there.
5926662	5927383	That's kind of cute.
5928163	5930505	I like how you can get the interview with M. Bison and everything.
5930685	5931145	Kind of funny.
5932906	5934828	Yeah, we were talking about that on the show earlier.
5934888	5935368	Oh, were you?
5935428	5935688	Yeah.
5935948	5936349	Oh, awesome.
5936929	5938190	Yeah, that's very well done.
5938310	5941252	And the moves are pretty much what you'd expect out of them.
5942625	5946047	You know, I don't really play a lot of these wrestling games, but that's pretty cool.
5946067	5946728	Dude, Dudley.
5947208	5947488	Yeah.
5947949	5948569	I like this, too.
5948950	5950551	In the side, like, what's recommended.
5950591	5952692	It looks like there's a Felicia in one of these.
5952732	5953593	Like, somebody did that.
5953933	5954293	Wow.
5955934	5957976	Big boobies on Felicia.
5958016	5958556	All right, anyway.
5959477	5959977	Moving on.
5960618	5962579	Going to SSJ100Matt on Twitter.
5963900	5964820	DarkTetsuya
5992358	5992759	to Milpitas.
5992859	5992959	Bye!
6004346	6004946	DarkSakura.com
6022777	6030244	TigerClaw says Ion and Atari is teaming up for the iCade, a classic arcade machine set up for your iPad.
6030645	6031546	Oh, that's adorable.
6031606	6041495	It's this cute little machine with tangible joystick and buttons that you can put your iPad in and, like, play old games with.
6041775	6042436	That's cool.
6043056	6043577	I like that.
6043697	6045058	Except the fact that you can buy a...
6046039	6063022	you know I know it's a really expensive way of playing something that you can get a million other ways but it's still cute I say it was cute and one more tweet for us from Tiger Claw Microsoft confirms that Kinect PC support is coming
6065049	6065550	Well, good.
6066391	6071396	As it should be, because if the modding community is so far ahead of them, it's almost a little bit embarrassing.
6071416	6072057	It is coming.
6072117	6073478	It already is here, basically.
6073518	6077042	Well, my official Kinect PC support is coming.
6077743	6082088	Steve Ballmer hinted at this support in his keynote speech there.
6082548	6084230	It is part of the company's larger plan.
6084270	6084571	Quote,
6085131	6088693	Well, we certainly started out on Xbox and we're very focused in on gaming.
6088973	6092395	We're the number one game console in a lot of countries and we're very happy about that.
6092835	6095956	We're trying to do two major things, though.
6096196	6102079	We're trying to move beyond gaming to include the world of socialization, movies, TV, and music.
6102459	6107542	And we're trying to make the whole experience accessible to everybody in the family, not just the traditional gamer.
6108002	6114085	So just expect this whole Kinect craze to grow, at least if Microsoft's keynote is to be taken at face value.
6114585	6114905	All right.
6144206	6148749	So this is kind of interesting and not too different than what they were doing.
6148769	6152271	I guess it's an improvement maybe.
6152892	6157175	But THQ for Homefronts, they're doing the online pass thing again.
6157615	6166161	But this time instead of just saying, hey, you know what, you better buy the game new or pay the $10 and have no online play.
6166521	6170223	They're saying, hey, you know what, you better buy the game new or pay $10 or have,
6173815	6175656	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
6203334	6203694	I don't know.
6204175	6210601	It's still kind of a crappy way of doing things, but it's slightly better than not offering any online component at all.
6210761	6213724	So now you get a demo of the online component.
6213744	6215606	That's basically what this boils down to.
6215666	6216587	That's kind of weird.
6220711	6222933	That's them combating the use sales.
6223113	6226777	But of course, I don't know if this is a game I'm particularly interested in, so we'll see.
6228126	6228466	Who knows?
6228627	6228987	It looked cool.
6248169	6276517	But some of the early leaders were Flight Control HD and Chopper 2 That's right, some of the same crap that you see on the iPhone and iPad Is also dominating the Mac App Store Now if you don't know what the Mac App Store is It's basically Imagine Steam and Apple kind of combined It's selling, I don't want to say PC games But Mac games, like for your actual Mac In the same vein that you buy iPad and iPod stuff right now I think it's a great idea
6277287	6280349	Well, it's a very logical and idea that makes sense.
6280409	6283612	And especially because, you know, a lot of these games are kind of cheaper this way.
6284032	6286314	Like games like Chopper 2, 99 cents.
6286954	6288155	Angry Birds, five bucks.
6289696	6294840	So, I mean, that's much cheaper than going into an actual store and paying 20 or even 40 bucks for one of these.
6295621	6297402	Of course, not everything is so cheap.
6297482	6301004	I mean, some programs like iMovie is 15 bucks.
6301225	6302566	Aperture, 80 bucks.
6303206	6305728	You know, but it's a way for them to sell, you know.
6307239	6331493	so uh interesting uh but what also is notable about this hackers you know the old saying hackers gonna hack so actually i just made up that saying so now we have haters gonna hate and hackers gonna hack well hackers gonna hack and they uh found the loophole in the mac app store they pirated angry birds already it took less than just a couple of days uh yep that's it
6333041	6339745	All you have to do is copy and paste this in-store purchase code and you can get the games for free.
6340265	6341205	By the way, I love this.
6341265	6344287	The name of the group that hacked the games, Hackulous.
6345127	6345387	Get it?
6345407	6346088	Like, tapulous?
6346288	6355893	Well, Hackulous, actually, they're responsible for the program Instalus, which is what people use to download pirated games on the iPod.
6357436	6357817	and iPad.
6357897	6361484	I keep thinking of Tapulous who makes Tap Tap Revenge.
6363167	6363708	That would be fun.
6364229	6367635	Alright, let's move on with some more stories.
6367675	6368176	DarkSakura.
6370390	6375153	Monster Hunter 3 event go on because the town itself was similar to the one used in the game.
6400009	6418860	and they had a lot of people go up including people who said that they probably would have never gone had you know they're not been the Monster Hunter event and I've got a couple of friends that live overseas who were totally in the Monster Hunter and like will go to the special Capcom events and camp out outside their offices and stuff so pretty crazy stuff
6419780	6424625	Konami did something similar for Love Plus at the Atami Onsen.
6425345	6427407	So they did the same thing.
6427668	6431751	And one was done at... Let me see if I can pronounce this right.
6432332	6440379	Shakunage no Mori Botanical Park in Mimata.
6440760	6442621	So they did something too.
6443162	6445184	That was for Colony Nasekatsu Plus.
6447992	6448753	Thanks for watching!
6463374	6465156	Can we get like Angry Birds the ride?
6465557	6475428	Can you imagine if you could go on like a Mario Brothers roller coaster where like as you're going up, like imagine, can you know that part of California Screamin' where it goes up, down, up, down, up, down?
6475448	6476209	That my favorite part?
6476389	6477550	Yeah, a bunch of hills really fast.
6477791	6482536	What should happen is at the top of every hill on the Mario coaster, ba-ding, ba-ding, ba-ding.
6482556	6483197	That would be great.
6484258	6486819	Tell me they could not make an awesome theme park out of a video game.
6486959	6487439	They could do it.
6487559	6490220	I mean, I guess it would be all the licensing and so forth.
6490280	6491300	It would be a pain in the ass.
6491340	6493160	But still, make it happen.
6494301	6495641	They made a game in a theme park.
6496421	6497482	The Toy Story game.
6497822	6498322	Oh, that's true.
6498522	6499082	That was fun.
6499322	6500462	That Toy Story game is awesome.
6500482	6506104	And they are actually able to update it like an iPhone game or something with new levels and things like that.
6506544	6510045	I haven't ridden it since Toy Story 3 came out, but I heard there's some newer stuff in there.
6510669	6511589	Yeah, that was really fun.
6511629	6512450	Keep surprises going.
6512470	6513490	And then the game came out.
6514971	6520733	But yeah, we could totally have a mall taken over by zombies.
6522374	6523394	Like a Dead Rising ride?
6523974	6524295	Maybe.
6525255	6525635	Perhaps.
6526656	6527936	Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
6529697	6531878	Loki, what would you want to see at a video game theme park?
6534619	6534759	Um...
6537045	6537565	I don't know.
6538205	6541006	I mean, I don't think it's really a good idea, actually.
6543166	6544246	You don't think it's a good idea?
6544326	6545187	Why not, hater?
6545667	6551248	I guess it'd be fun to see, like, giant rabbit, you know, people dressed up as the giant rabbits or whatever.
6551468	6552148	That'd be kind of funny.
6554108	6556189	Or just imagine booth babes everywhere.
6558709	6561370	So you're suggesting a Hooters theme park.
6563513	6565094	They have a Hooters hotel, why not?
6565134	6565495	They do.
6566275	6568317	It's the ugliest looking hotel I've ever seen.
6568777	6574642	Can you imagine one of those station wagons with the wood grain paneling on the outside turned into a hotel?
6574982	6576664	That would be the Hooters hotel.
6577244	6580187	They have wood grain paneling on the outside of the hotel.
6581748	6582128	Why?
6584470	6585091	I don't know, why?
6585971	6586832	Because they're tacky.
6588113	6590335	Alright, let's move on to another story.
6590575	6591436	Loki, what do you have for us?
6592165	6595409	I'm not getting a reply I'm not getting a reply
6609002	6611745	The Elder Scrolls Game
6627762	6630224	One is going to be the way that the game actually levels.
6630564	6640631	The player's levels are now going to be more balanced because I guess actually in the game, much like Fallout 3 and that kind of stuff, as you level up, the enemies level up as well.
6640691	6643072	Well, in Oblivion, it got to the point where it was...
6644273	6650376	Pretty damn impossible to be able to go up against some of the enemies because they would just be leveling up with you.
6650956	6654098	I don't like roleplaying games where they level completely up with you.
6654158	6657799	I think at some point you have to be able to overpower them a little bit.
6657939	6658520	A little bit.
6658780	6663622	I do agree that it should be a difficulty setting if something like that.
6664482	6670767	Anyways, it's going to scale to the player's level, but it's going to be more balanced, they're saying.
6671087	6682394	It says foes will likely be easily bested by using some of the new features in the game, like dual wielding, I guess is going to be a new feature that they're going to have.
6682434	6688158	You can equip any item or spell to either hand using both simultaneously in combat.
6689659	6691721	So that's pretty cool.
6692141	6693101	And then, of course,
6694963	6706150	They were saying that, I guess, also the leveling system, they're saying no longer binds players to class defined by a set of skills.
6706170	6718218	It says players can pick and choose from the game's 18 abilities, which level up while using them simultaneously, unlocking perks with each new level.
6718918	6720739	So it basically sounds like it's going to be Fallout.
6721479	6730304	And then they're also going to include new weapon crafting systems, improved character creation tools, etc.
6730744	6736527	And that's pretty cool, character creation-wise, because I believe their tools are pretty impressive in Oblivion.
6736567	6746552	The only problem I found with Oblivion, though, is I can create any character I want as long as they were butt-fucking-ugly, because that's all that that tool would create is really ugly-looking people.
6748194	6750676	You know, the Fallout one isn't much better, to be honest.
6750716	6755900	I don't know how much you've played around in Fallout 3, but a lot of the characters are fugs there, too.
6756760	6757741	So, sorry to say.
6759102	6762164	By the way, SolarFlare reminds me in the chatroom, like FF8, Rob?
6762525	6764086	Yes, exactly like that.
6767844	6768104	All right.
6769284	6771765	One more story for you guys, then we're going to get to Listless tonight.
6771805	6772445	I'm so excited.
6772485	6773846	I haven't even told you guys the topic.
6773886	6775086	I think it's a fun topic tonight.
6775186	6777427	But if you were paying attention earlier in the show, we dropped a hint.
6777847	6778007	Yep.
6778107	6779047	So maybe you figured it out.
6779407	6782888	And I finally got a guest for us, and it's an exciting guest that we haven't had on the show in a while.
6783008	6783188	Yep.
6783569	6785129	So we'll get to that in a minute.
6785809	6788170	I want to go to this story about EA.
6788590	6790552	Pulling the plug on some old games.
6790572	6798880	That's right, the servers are getting shut down for some old games because that fee you pay to use Xbox Live, well, it doesn't pay to keep old shit running.
6799441	6805967	Now, the good news is most of this stuff is old sports games, you know, games that have been replaced with newer versions.
6806007	6809891	For example, NCAA Basketball 08 and 09, gone.
6810311	6811793	NCAA Football 07, 08, 09 in 2010, gone.
6813861	6814662	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6828561	6828901	DarkSakura.com
6848980	6853062	Also closing on January 17th, the Sims Carnival.
6853663	6861107	So if you were a Sims Carnival fan, but there must not have been that many of you because EA's shutting the server down, you will not be able to play anymore after January 17th.
6861347	6863828	And there's this contingent out there going, there was a Sims Carnival?
6864088	6864649	Exactly.
6865741	6869346	Now, February 8th is when most of the sports games are scheduled to close.
6869707	6871589	To be honest, this is nothing new.
6872450	6878258	It's always a bummer when it's games that aren't really sports games that upgrade every year, but it's kind of inevitable.
6879019	6882223	And again, they feel like they can pull the plug because you're not playing them.
6883044	6883384	Party Party
6912734	6915415	It's time for Listless tonight, boys and girls.
6915535	6916215	I'm so excited.
6916255	6917235	We haven't done one of these in a while.
6917535	6922236	The way Listless works, we are going to be forming the definitive list.
6922936	6925397	And there is no arguing once this list is complete.
6925417	6927217	This is a very scientific method.
6927577	6935279	And it involves you guys in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com We're going to bring in a fourth person to play along with us tonight.
6935319	6936239	Let's get him on the line.
6937779	6940380	I'll dumb down the music here while we give our friend a call.
6942847	6942987	Hello!
6943007	6943087	Hi!
6943167	6943208	Hi!
6943268	6945050	Is this Breslow? !
6957893	6958693	It usually is.
6959154	6960654	Oh, Lord, hang up, Rob.
6960735	6962235	Long time no talk, my friend.
6962275	6962876	How are you?
6962976	6963716	I'm kidding.
6963756	6965297	Happy New Year, DarkSakura.
6965397	6965937	Geez.
6966597	6967198	I'm kidding.
6967278	6968078	Hard, hard, hard, hard.
6968158	6971100	What are your New Year's resolutions, Breslau?
6971140	6971800	It doesn't matter.
6971840	6972981	I've broken them all already.
6973001	6976142	I did my first episode of USL, so those are all out the window.
6976222	6977243	Congratulations.
6977843	6985566	If you don't know Bress Lowell, not only has he guested on this show a little bit in the past, not so much lately though, sadly, but that's because he's too busy doing another show.
6985666	6991668	He's big time now, a host on Under Sedation Live, which is Saturday nights on the All Games Network.
6992248	6999091	And with Iguana Girl, who's been on this show as well, Jessica Harper, Travis Donovan, who I'm afraid to have on this show.
6999671	7002012	But Rob's never been on Under Sedation Live, has he?
7002072	7003072	That's where I grew up.
7003132	7004513	That was my old stomping grounds.
7005177	7008018	Apparently, this is our 10th year doing it, and we didn't even realize it.
7008418	7008898	Wow.
7009438	7012679	And here I was talking about OLR celebrating the 400th episode.
7013039	7015080	But, you know, USL's taking a lot of breaks.
7015140	7016260	I don't even know if they've gotten up to 400.
7016300	7017701	I hate to say it, DMN.
7018001	7018341	I don't know.
7019201	7019861	Whoa, hey.
7020061	7020901	Blast from the past there.
7021042	7021922	Oh, sorry, Breslow.
7022502	7024342	Because I'm looking at... Never mind, I don't want to say it.
7024362	7026123	But I'm looking at something, and it still says the old name.
7027657	7030040	I wanted to have you on specifically to talk about USL madness
7038496	7042677	Yes, we extended the deadline because not a lot of people submitted.
7043598	7048619	Basically what you do is you get a list of your 25 most favorite video games of all time.
7049259	7056142	They can be as far back as Atari 2600 and television, and they can be as modern as Xbox 360, PS3, PC.
7056442	7058162	They can even be your favorite arcade games.
7058202	7062024	We actually have had one nomination for Skee-Ball, believe it or not.
7062224	7064865	Okay, good choice actually.
7064905	7065885	Skee-Ball is pretty awesome.
7066499	7081598	but basically what you do is you get that list together order it from 1 to 25 1 being Super Metroid, 25 being Minecraft or something I like how you told everybody what to make their number ones your number one you're just going to put Super Metroid next to it because otherwise you're crazy
7083464	7103110	and then you submit those to uslmadness at gmail.com voting actually we extended it a week it closes tonight at midnight pacific which is if you're listening live less than 4 hours from now alright procrastinators I expect the live listeners to get cracking do you accept like partial lists what if somebody's like I can't get to 25 but I've got 10 would you take that?
7104110	7104591	LB to Action!
7104611	7105031	What's that?
7123050	7123731	Wow!
7124111	7129516	Yeah, Minecraft's in the top 30, Pac-Man's in the top 30, Fallout might get a one seed this year.
7129876	7131017	Like, that's how nuts it is.
7131457	7131898	Nice.
7132358	7135180	Now, DDRDollarBill's in the chatroom saying, fuck Minecraft.
7135441	7139744	So, DDRDollarBill, that means you better get your list in so you can bump Minecraft down a little bit.
7140545	7142947	And then we will announce the bracket sometime this coming week.
7143708	7146650	Alright, uslmadness at gmail.com.
7146930	7148391	Super Metroid's a one seed, right?
7149452	7149793	No.
7149813	7149973	What?!
7150013	7150093	What? !
7153157	7153737	Yeah, I know.
7153857	7155338	This whole contest is a sham.
7158239	7159459	Your listeners are insane.
7159499	7160179	I'm not sure which.
7160480	7162020	Are you ready to play listless with us tonight?
7162620	7163000	I am.
7163160	7166982	I actually have a list ready of something that I don't know anything about.
7167102	7167942	Here we go.
7168082	7170443	Because I don't tell you the topics in advance.
7170523	7172644	That would never happen in the magic of radio.
7173744	7175645	Let's tell the listeners already what the topic is.
7175705	7184509	Alright, if you were listening in Part A, I said pay attention when Loki did the story about THQ and Mattel are entering a game deal, which means we might get a Masters of the Universe video game.
7184969	7186470	So we thought, you know what we should do?
7186950	7191312	Let's talk about toys that we think ought to be video games.
7191592	7195393	Because, you know, if we limited it to just Mattel, I don't know what's Mattel and what's not.
7195413	7196574	Like, Barbie's Mattel, right?
7196614	7196914	I don't know.
7197314	7198955	So we're going to just say toys in general.
7199355	7208140	board games, whatever anything you can find in the toy aisle at Target or Walmart or Toys R Us I should say is fair game.
7208520	7209761	Except for like diapers.
7209901	7211862	Like I don't think they should make a video game out of diapers.
7211922	7213883	So if you guys have diapers on your list, please remove it.
7213943	7216325	It has to be an actual marketed toy item.
7216345	7217305	Yes, it needs to be a toy.
7217405	7219106	So babies R Us items don't count.
7219166	7219747	Alright everybody?
7220127	7222288	Now chat room here's what you guys need to do.
7222348	7227271	You need to start suggesting things in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com because if one of the hosts
7227851	7232355	Ends up duplicating something we usually turn to chat to figure out how to fill in the gaps there.
7234053	7240555	Also, the chat plays a very important part in this, because what's going to happen, we're going to go around and everybody's going to name their top three.
7240635	7244137	Myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and Breslow will each name their top three.
7244517	7248018	Then each of us will go around and take one item off of the list.
7248058	7249959	Something will not be worthy of the list.
7250299	7256021	That will leave us with a list of eight, and you guys in our chatroom vote to come up with a definitive list of three.
7256321	7259962	I know this sounds really complicated, you guys, but that's why it's a scientific process.
7260302	7261543	Science is hard, y'all.
7264109	7265010	Be careful, guys.
7265030	7266270	We're about to try science.
7268151	7269912	She blinded me with science.
7269992	7270253	All right.
7270993	7272274	Let's get into the list.
7272434	7273334	Why don't we start tonight?
7273975	7274775	How about Loki?
7275696	7278857	I don't know how often you start in list list, but tonight you're starting this list list.
7279258	7281919	What toy ought to be a video game?
7282159	7288483	This is a terrible, terrible answer, but I'm going to do it anyways because it's simple.
7288943	7289403	It's simple.
7289963	7290244	Ball.
7290264	7290344	Ball.
7292025	7292445	Ball.
7293066	7293626	Ball!
7294167	7298030	Okay, tell us how the game Ball works.
7299091	7300172	Really can be anything.
7300252	7303575	You see, balls are very versatile toys.
7303635	7305836	You can play whatever games you want with them.
7306637	7306957	Ball.
7307638	7309119	Press A to bounce.
7312922	7315745	It'd be like one of those reverse sandbox games or something.
7316605	7318247	It's Minecraft, but with balls.
7322258	7323580	I can see the commercial now.
7323680	7324841	Come, play with our balls.
7325282	7327144	Alright, I'll go next.
7327224	7328245	My number three choice.
7328366	7331329	My number three choice for toy they should make into a game.
7332170	7334293	Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven.
7335094	7337156	That was on my list and I removed it, Rob.
7340290	7342891	All right, so, Cookie Mama... Wouldn't that be in the reverse, though?
7343611	7344011	What do you mean?
7344591	7349793	They're, like, kind of making a video game into a toy.
7350853	7352594	The toy's already existed ever since I was a little girl.
7352614	7354415	No, it's video games based on a toy.
7354435	7358716	Easy Bake Ovens have been around forever, and now Cookie Mama's gonna take that old toy... I understand.
7358776	7362737	...and she's gonna make fine cuisine with nothing but a light bulb.
7362757	7364498	You press the eject button and food comes out.
7364758	7366699	DarkSakura, what is your number three answer?
7366739	7368540	Toy that ought to be a game.
7390427	7392148	The erector set level building game.
7393089	7397612	We have to build the whole thing out of erector sets and then you run your little guy through the erector set.
7398353	7398673	Okay.
7399434	7401495	It's kind of like a Lego game but not because it's an erector set.
7401515	7402496	Kind of a little big planet.
7403036	7405618	Only you build the whole thing out of erectors.
7406259	7406379	Wow.
7406399	7406839	Erector sets.
7407900	7408800	Well, screw chat.
7408840	7411102	They're not giving the answers that come on the show.
7411162	7412083	You are, Bressel.
7412143	7413124	It doesn't matter if chat took them.
7413944	7415946	Here's my throwaway choice then.
7416026	7416466	Alright, fine.
7417186	7417407	Homies.
7417427	7417627	Homies.
7420062	7420683	Oh, God.
7420723	7421384	Little Homies.
7421404	7423125	Those little toys, the Homies.
7423406	7424166	Oh, no.
7424787	7425027	Yeah.
7425147	7426549	I haven't seen those in forever.
7426569	7428130	Hey, you want to hear something ironic?
7428430	7428610	Huh?
7428691	7430412	There was a Little Homies game.
7430452	7430933	Was there?
7431013	7431793	Yes, there was.
7431934	7432254	Wow.
7432274	7433575	Well, they need to do a better one.
7434156	7435457	What would the Homies game be?
7435857	7436258	Brestle.
7437020	7438361	I don't know, Saints Row 3?
7439041	7441143	It was a kart racing game, is what it was.
7441463	7442263	Oh, God.
7442703	7443304	Screw that.
7443344	7444184	They need to do it again.
7445005	7445285	Alright.
7446446	7448727	I love some of the choices that are coming out in chat, by the way.
7449047	7452349	Alright, number two pick, Loki, who brought us Ball.
7452549	7455771	What is your number two pick for a toy they ought to make into a video game?

7512094	7515658	Because I can think of no better way to rave than with Light Bright.
7518080	7520163	Use your Light Bright to throw a sweet rave party.
7520303	7521124	Exactly.
7521905	7524888	Sandstorm is already a confirmed song in Light Bright DDR.
7524948	7525529	Just so y'all know.
7528806	7529967	It'd be awesome and you know it.
7530007	7534429	It'd be rave and the kids would be getting high and playing their light bright DDR.

7549877	7550537	Bratz Doom.
7550697	7551397	Bratz Doom.
7552478	7553619	Shoot the Bratz, alright?
7553819	7554299	I like that.
7556245	7558026	Would the final level have Paula Abdul?
7558046	7559387	Because she was involved with the movie.
7559507	7561167	Or no wait, she got fired from the movie, I think.
7561607	7564569	Dude, you have to be a special kind of stupid to get fired from the Bratz movie.
7564589	7565729	Or a special kind of high.
7568971	7570611	Wall drugs.
7570891	7571171	All right.
7572172	7574073	Loki, what is... I'm sorry, not Loki.
7574173	7574753	Breslul.
7575673	7576734	You guys are so the same.
7576814	7577714	It's hard to tell you guys apart.
7578194	7579235	One of you is sitting right here.
7579315	7579775	All right.
7579815	7584217	Breslul, what is your number two choice for a toy they need to make into a video game?
7585037	7588642	I really hope one of you three have heard of this board game, but I'm gonna say Dominion.
7591582	7592263	We'll see you next time.
7619894	7630579	Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set, Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, and Dominion.
7631120	7633361	Loki, what is your number one pick?
7633781	7638683	I'll take your Bratz Doom and I'll raise you Dead Rising Mole Madness.
7640324	7641064	That's great.
7641504	7642045	That's great.
7642785	7649607	Not only do you have to fight off zombies, but you also have to find good deals on clothing and other couture.
7651308	7652368	I really should have put that.
7652428	7653969	What's that dating game called?
7654009	7656770	I really should have put that on my list and I didn't.
7656990	7657750	Girl Talk?
7658030	7658650	Girl Talk!
7660746	7665450	Actually, they have this really shitty looking game that I've seen at Target.
7665490	7668413	It's something about, like, it's called, like, Oops, That's the Truth.
7668673	7669774	What the hell is this game called?
7670214	7674879	It's some type of, like, weird party game that they're selling as an Xbox 360 game.
7675259	7678382	Oh, um... Somebody's had to have heard of this.
7678482	7679383	No, I know what you're talking about.
7679403	7680804	It's the Truth or Lies?
7680944	7681845	Yes, that game.
7682822	7685043	No, it's called Truth or Bargain Bin, actually.
7685983	7687103	Exactly, very soon.
7687503	7688984	Alright, my number one pick.
7689204	7692084	I picked a serious one, just like Bressol did for his last one.
7692444	7696886	My serious number one answer, Millborn on Xbox Live Arcade.
7697026	7698866	That would be pretty badass, too.
7699186	7702207	Millborn is like the best French card game ever made.
7702747	7706148	It might be the only French card game ever made, but damn it, it's awesome.
7709971	7712193	The whole point of that game is to fuck your buddy.
7712293	7713375	That's the whole point of the game.
7715762	7717102	DarkSakura, what's your number one answer?
7717122	7718363	My Little Pony Deathmatch
7749187	7751549	I think it should be... They bite and get rabies and stuff.
7752970	7757614	I think it should be like Derby Owners Club, but with My Little Pony where you can whip the horses when they're bad.
7757734	7760176	And whichever one is last gets shot.
7761157	7763999	Michael Vick presents My Little Pony Deathmatch.
7765400	7767882	Okay, how about we call it... Here's the name.
7768163	7769263	Death Race My Little Pony.
7769784	7773447	And if you pre-order now, we'll give you a year's supply of Elmer's glue.
7775308	7775989	I was thinking that.
7777556	7780558	Death Race, My Little Pony is DarkSakura's number one answer.
7780898	7782519	DarkSakura, I'm noticing a trend here.
7782579	7784240	I think you have some anger issues.
7784800	7786301	Somebody's homicidal tonight.
7787142	7789663	Breslow, what is your number one answer?
7790564	7796167	This was mentioned in the chat, and this is basically Pong on crack in board game form, Crossfire.
7798095	7799996	Oh shit, I remember the commercials for those.
7800016	7802397	That's the one where you have all those steel balls, right?
7802537	7803177	Yeah.
7803477	7806298	My mother would never buy me that when I was growing up.
7807538	7808999	My mom wouldn't buy me that either.
7809019	7810499	I love my mom.
7810519	7813280	There was a pinball table that used that same thing called Hyperball.
7813460	7813760	Really?
7814321	7815461	Crossfire was awesome.
7815521	7816721	All the little boys wanted one.
7817322	7818322	Probably some of the girls, too.
7818362	7819963	I bet DarkSakura wanted Crossfire, too.
7820263	7821183	Yeah, my mom wouldn't get it for me.
7821723	7823264	But she got it for my brothers, go figure!
7824344	7825385	Our parents were all mean.
7825505	7826926	Loki, did your parents buy you Crossfire?
7827647	7829748	I didn't want it, but I got to play it and it was fun.
7830929	7831630	One moment.
7832030	7834832	Shoot a bunch of balls at this other thing with ball in the middle.
7835312	7836033	You alright, Bressel?
7837994	7841197	Bressel needed to put the show on hold for a minute so he could tend to some business.
7841537	7842658	BRB, poopin'!
7844179	7844479	All right.
7845200	7846980	Well, here's the list as it stands right now.
7847200	7864168	Ball, Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dominion, Dead Rising Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade, Death Race My Little Pony, and Crossfire.
7864548	7865649	This is hard.
7865709	7867409	We have to eliminate some of these from the list.
7867449	7868290	I don't know if I can.
7868710	7870791	All right, but we got... That's how it works.
7870991	7873873	So, Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7874013	7874413	Homies.
7874893	7875893	It's already got a game in.
7876054	7876414	It's crap.
7876794	7877634	Sorry.
7877714	7879095	Homies is gone.
7879635	7880916	Brussels, back from his poop.
7881016	7881456	Welcome back.
7881976	7882257	All right.
7885258	7885538	Let's see.
7885578	7886118	My turn.
7886238	7886939	Oh, this is hard.
7886999	7888259	I don't want to eliminate any of these.
7888800	7888820	I...
7889840	7892802	I'm sorry, I hate to do this because I know the chatters probably love this one.
7892863	7895885	I've got to eliminate Ball because I just don't get it.
7896525	7897486	What is the game?
7899548	7901529	That sounds like a tech demo to me, so I'm sorry.
7901609	7903190	Ball has been stricken from the list.
7903591	7905772	DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7905952	7907734	Only for lack of familiarity, Dominion.
7909135	7912476	Oh, poor Breslul got two of them yanked from the list.
7912717	7917019	But that's okay, Breslul, because you're obviously not going to eliminate your own, so you get at least one on there.
7917459	7920241	Breslul, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7920961	7922542	I'm going to eliminate Crossfire.
7922602	7924583	I mean, Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven.
7925644	7928005	Oh, why are you eliminating Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven?
7928783	7958143	because if only on the guarantee that it'll like my Xbox will spit out delicious treats which I don't think that technology is quite there yet so not yet not until we get the holodeck and how it makes food and everything all right so here's the list that our chatters are going to vote on you're going to vote for your number one and number two pick and you're going to send them over private message to sky in the chat room please label your number one and your number two choices or I'm going to assume what you list first is number one and what you list second is number two so here is the
7959384	7960144	You alright, Breslow?
7960465	7961045	You need a minute?
7962506	7964829	Alright, so here's the list as it stands right now.
7965349	7977701	Erector Set Level Building Game, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dead Rising Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade, Death Race, My Little Pony, and Crossfire.
7978201	7984607	Chatters, it's now in your hands to come up with a definitive list of the top three toys that need to be video games.
7984747	7989748	And while you're at it, Breslau, repeat the March Madness, the USL Madness email.
7990728	7991208	I will do that.
7991268	7994069	It is uslmadness at gmail.com.
7995089	8000030	You have about three and a half hours to get those submissions in.
8000090	8002171	If you're listening on the podcast, I'm sorry.
8002211	8008832	The expiration has gone past, but we will have voting up probably by the time you're listening to this.
8009932	8013253	And I noticed that somebody in studio just sent you an email.
8013618	8016245	I think I already did one before, but I did it again just to be safe.
8017287	8021317	I don't think I got one from you, but I'm assuming that it now rhymes with Waklakura.
8024065	8024205	Yeah.
8024225	8025366	You might be right, actually.
8025826	8026107	All right.
8026167	8026347	Yeah.
8026507	8027107	So there you go.
8027447	8030009	Thank you so much for playing our dumb little game tonight, Brestle.
8030029	8030890	We really appreciate it.
8030970	8034232	Best of luck with USL Madness and everything that goes on at Understation Live.
8034573	8035713	Tell the others we said hi.
8036854	8040937	Tell Iguana Girl I'd like to go see another D-Box movie with her at some point and have Pinkberry.
8040957	8041137	Okay.
8041477	8041718	All right.
8042758	8043999	Hey, guys, one more thing.
8044299	8044560	Yes.
8045020	8045520	Yeah, he hung up.
8046981	8047482	Ask.
8047702	8048262	You ask.
8048502	8050324	They have Ninja Legos now.
8050864	8052705	Place your vote, by the way, right now.
8052745	8054246	Send your number one and your number two choices.
8054267	8057449	You have until the end of the mailbag segment to get those votes in.
8057489	8058630	And I'll tell you a spoiler.
8058870	8060511	There's not a lot of emails tonight.
8060591	8061712	So hurry, hurry, hurry.
8062072	8063753	But let's see what is in the email bag.
8063773	8065915	We're going to open it up right now, folks.
8068559	8072321	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us your emails every week.
8072401	8077965	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura is going to jump in the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite emails for you all.
8077985	8079326	How about the one email we got?
8079566	8080186	One email?
8080647	8081047	Holy shit.
8081067	8081607	It's a big one though.
8081827	8083008	You better get those votes in now.
8083528	8085269	Well, it actually is from Rababa.
8085830	8091633	Picking apart an Ars Technica story about Nintendo warning about the 3D for young gamers.
8092254	8093635	So I'm going to read the email as is.
8094655	8101116	First, they claim that eye growth as literally translated may be harmed according to a warning statement for the 3DS.
8101497	8104937	They state that it isn't about actual growth, but rather perception.
8105397	8110719	The concern is that the portions of our visual system that reside in the brain are adaptive.
8111319	8116900	They adjust to information we receive and can remap connections in order to operate more efficiently on a typical input.
8117300	8122041	This is especially true in infants as the visual system is still developing at the earliest stages of life.
8122409	8142043	which is true, babies can't see much of anything for the first few weeks except blurs this ability to rewire our visual system on the fly is behind the 3D health concerns I actually don't know if what they state is true but it does seem made up to me I wish it said according to this article in the Lancet or the like
8142663	8150966	I find it odd that they forget about the common eye disorder lazy eye where muscles in one eye don't grow causing a seemingly cross eye.
8151026	8154748	This treatment is remarkably simple wearing an eye patch to exercise the weaker eye.
8155488	8158670	I always assumed the warning was for conditions like lazy eye.
8158710	8159230	What do you think?
8159950	8164435	Also, isn't the warning more about what we don't know about simulated 3D effects?
8165055	8168879	I'm sure that there will also be warnings to stop using 3D if you develop nausea or headache.
8169239	8172062	Either way, it must be better than the red-blue 3D.
8172462	8173183	Later, rababa.
8174424	8175145	Cyan magenta.
8177199	8187388	I think we got into this a little bit last week on the show with the disclaimer, but I think it's just Nintendo kind of overcompensating a little bit where it's just that we live in a too happy society.
8188529	8189369	They're covering their ass.
8189770	8194293	Yeah, and I think a kid would have to play these games for a very long time.
8194594	8198437	But I'll admit, when I was playing the 3DS, I did feel that little pull on my eyes.
8198957	8201899	But, you know, when it got to me, I just would turn the slider off.
8202279	8206861	So it's really about just kind of knowing your limits, I suppose, and knowing when to turn that off.
8207262	8212164	Now, I guess a child wouldn't really know their limits, but that's why parents have to supervise, you guys.
8215066	8215766	So, I don't know.
8216026	8217167	I don't know what else to say on that.
8218968	8220449	Anything else for that email, DarkSakura?
8220469	8221009	Nope.
8221476	8222117	Death Race, Not Dead Rising
8242777	8243297	Dead.
8243317	8247462	This is the very, very last call.
8247482	8252067	If you don't get those votes in now, they may not count because we have to move into the FUs of the week.
8252107	8254189	It's the part of the show where we get angsty.
8270191	8278238	F you to my hip for hurting like a motherfucker all week and keeping me from doing fun things.
8278358	8281921	However, I have leveled quite a bit in World of Warcraft and F you to that too.
8284063	8284343	Loki?
8285925	8286826	F you to my shoulder.
8287546	8294572	I must have slept on it weird or something last night because it's been hurting the hell out of me today, so that really sucks.
8295013	8298756	Are you sure that your child hasn't learned how to climb out of the crib and come chew on your shoulder?
8299233	8302055	No, he tried to eat my nose last night though, so it's possible.
8302135	8303637	Well, babies are always sticking things in their mouths.
8303657	8305358	I don't know if you saw the picture on Facebook Nellie posted.
8306279	8307360	That picture was great.
8307800	8310783	It was like some, he just like all of a sudden started attacking my nose.
8310843	8311323	It was funny.
8311983	8312744	It's something!
8313044	8313485	Bite!
8315286	8316167	Babies are cute.
8316707	8319349	Until they get three and decide to jump on you and break your back.
8320250	8321171	And then they're still cute.
8322711	8327654	Yeah, the way that I hurt my hip is catching Becky's son Julian.
8328715	8331316	Because now he's falling with style on top of people.
8332337	8333057	Like in Toy Story.
8337540	8342423	Alright, my FU of the week goes to people that are always negative.
8342823	8343464	All the time.
8343524	8347046	People that just live in this negative little world with their negative little comments.
8347406	8349307	They never have anything good to say.
8349367	8350688	Jeez, Rob, you're complaining a lot.
8352483	8352923	Shut up!
8354044	8354784	That was negative too!
8354804	8355544	No, but I'm serious.
8355965	8363968	I just say there's certain fun things that I like to do and the amount of negativity surrounding them is starting to suck the fun out of it.
8364028	8365468	It's nothing any of you are involved with.
8365488	8365929	Don't worry about it.
8367089	8374832	So it's kind of one of those things where I'm starting to get to my wits end and it's kind of like I might have to give it up because it's not fun anymore.
8374852	8375913	That's a bummer.
8375973	8377474	It's nothing to do with podcasting, y'all.
8377494	8378134	Don't start rumors.
8378494	8379154	Or Warcraft.
8379734	8380935	So it's just frustrating.
8382716	8383999	Anyhow, drama.
8385241	8386684	There's always drama somewheres.
8388128	8392196	But let's make things a little happier and get into the listless results!
8394062	8395142	Yay!
8395202	8396583	Results of tonight's list list.
8396643	8397163	This is it.
8397463	8399103	This is the definitive list, you guys.
8399183	8400624	Oh, we got a late vote.
8402144	8403765	I almost would not let this count.
8403805	8406365	However, I don't think it's going to change the final result here.
8406866	8407386	No, it does not.
8407406	8407726	All right.
8408786	8410487	The top three, and this is it, guys.
8410507	8411627	There is no disputing.
8411687	8415048	These are the three games you want to see them make out of toys.
8415468	8417509	Number three tonight, and it was a close one.
8417929	8422110	Number three tonight was Death Race, My Little Pony.
8422130	8422410	Woo!
8423430	8424290	Yay!
8424330	8426291	We want those ponies to fight to the death.
8427771	8431812	Your number two pick for game you most want to see them make out of an old toy.
8432533	8433653	Crossfire.
8434593	8435413	That's going to be interesting.
8435453	8436374	I don't know how that would be a video game.
8436394	8437854	You should find the commercial for Crossfire, Rob.
8437874	8439575	Didn't it have like a catchy little theme song to it?
8439595	8440315	I think it did.
8440395	8440655	Hold on.
8440675	8442135	I think somebody had posted it in chat.
8442155	8443756	Let me see if I can YouTube it real quick.
8443796	8444316	Here, hold on.
8444676	8446696	The getty caught in the crossfire.
8446716	8447577	Something like that.
8448917	8450538	It was retarded and funny at the same time.
8450798	8453359	And it had this red and blue background.
8453439	8453999	Okay, hold on.
8454239	8454759	Hold on, kids.
8454799	8455199	Here we go.
8455299	8456860	Coming soon to a video game store near you.
8484141	8488345	I found one of those at a thrift store.
8488625	8489847	God, the 80s were amazing.
8489887	8491729	Rob, with the label on it, Missing Balls.
8491749	8495112	It was like a year ago.
8495132	8497094	This game has no balls.
8497735	8503061	And the number one toy you most want to see turn into a game.
8503601	8504863	Come on, you guys know our audience.
8504903	8505323	What is it?
8506464	8525170	Light Bright DDR Yay, everyone get out the E in the sandstorm Everyone rave, coming soon Hugs, hugs everybody, hugs I made some candy because you're my friend you guys Let's hug, can we cuddle?
8527011	8528051	And then there's the make out room
8529309	8530870	No, it's the cuddle room.
8531610	8532510	It's not the make-out room.
8532590	8534051	Oh, you know that's what it's going to turn into later.
8534071	8536792	Did you ever go to... I want to say you went to one.
8536832	8538513	I just remember we both went to one or something.
8538553	8540634	No, I went to a roller skate rave.
8543049	8546032	I love Tracy Lords, I'm not even going to lie.
8568212	8575999	Oh yeah, and Sunscreen and all of those mid-90s dance music.
8576980	8583265	And there was activities going on in the outside because we couldn't do anything inside the rink.
8583606	8585007	Sorry, we needed a soundtrack to this.
8586889	8590232	But we had people in various states of intoxication on roller skates.
8591553	8592153	It was amazing.
8592373	8594035	Loki, did you ever go to a rave when you were younger?
8596023	8598044	No, but I had to clean up a rave.
8598424	8601807	And that's not much fun.
8602207	8609212	Apparently, they got the good idea to host a rave at the Cusar.
8609972	8611754	Oh, God.
8611954	8622861	And most people, I guess there was an orgy on the T-Mech machine, and there was also an orgy on the hard-driving machine, I think.
8623742	8624583	The nap machine.
8625203	8629406	Anyway, so they had that, but people started... How can you have an orgy in the hard drive then?
8629786	8630186	I don't know.
8630206	8631227	You can't fit more than one person in there.
8631247	8631827	I wasn't there.
8632467	8636150	But anyway, people were paying money to go inside the arena.
8636190	8638451	They weren't even really playing laser tag.
8638471	8641173	They were just staring at the colors from all the black lights.
8641833	8644435	So, uh, yeah, I missed out on that, unfortunately.
8644756	8647298	But I got to come in and clean it up afterwards, and that sucked.
8669037	8697989	so uh yeah so that rave was kind of dopey but the other one was like an outdoor kind of thing I don't even know where it was because I wasn't watching where we were driving and I had a lot of fun I have to I'm not gonna lie I had a lot you know for being like the E for being 20 I didn't do any of that and actually everybody really respected my wishes um to not get into doing any of that but um I'm not gonna lie um there was this guy who I think might have had some of the substances it was really hot and we just made out all night like I didn't I didn't need nothing to get me in the mood
8699490	8701312	I'm like, you're hot, that's drug enough for me.
8703474	8703974	Oh, Rob.
8704395	8705035	So that was the day.
8705076	8707478	And then actually, I kissed a girl at that same wave.
8708279	8708439	Ew!
8708619	8712884	I know, because she's, okay, this has nothing to do with games, but I don't even care, this is funny.
8713744	8719771	She took this book, or she had this book of everybody she'd ever made out with was in this book.
8720547	8735700	and uh she was on page 67 and i said i want to be page 69 in your book like i i have to like this is my new goal i want to be page 69 in your book and she's like well i'll make out with you but i have to have 68 first so i was like you make out with her
8737361	8763191	and so she made out with this random guy and then made out with me and then I was number 69 and then this is so terrible you guys don't do this at home then we decided we were all three gonna kiss and that's when I got introduced to three-way kissing which is really weird yeah it's it's there's certain things I can't say with my husband any other just kidding
8763671	8766555	So that was my raving experience.
8767876	8768517	It was a good time.
8770058	8772141	I've just done the roller rave.
8772181	8773402	It wasn't sex.
8773482	8774924	It was just kissing.
8774944	8775785	I've done the roller rave.
8776526	8777447	The roller rave was fun.
8777927	8779289	Because I drank a lot of beer.
8780410	8781932	And I can roller skate drunk.
8783673	8784213	All righty.
8784914	8785634	Let's move on.
8785794	8787474	Do not drink and roller skate.
8788655	8790736	It is a bigger disaster than drinking and driving.
8790836	8793637	Let's try to get back into some actual video game news.
8794717	8796718	Unless Loki wants to talk about three-way kissing.
8796778	8797118	I don't know.
8797558	8799319	I have no experience in that, I'm afraid.
8800239	8802000	Well, then I guess we'll have to go back to video game news.
8802420	8804120	I guess we're going to have to.
8806141	8811165	So there was concern with Harmonix being sold by MTV.
8811845	8812786	Who was going to buy them?
8813686	8814747	Was it going to be Activision?
8814827	8816508	God, let's hope it's not Activision.
8817129	8822052	But ironically enough, no one ever thought Harmonix may buy Harmonix.
8822393	8823553	And that's what happened.
8824494	8831262	Apparently our Harmonix, they've been purchased and they have an investment group.
8831882	8834886	Columbus Nova also took part in that.
8834926	8839591	They purchased them for $49.99 plus whatever debt they had.
8839811	8843716	So apparently they're going to...
8846981	8872502	take on their debts and stuff but Harmonix will assume responsibility over its liabilities and also includes music rights fees and responsibilities for lots of unsold games and equipment sitting on warehouse shelves also they're going to be able to keep the rights to Rock Band and Dent Central and will have control over those franchises so that's kind of cool
8873931	8875652	and Viacom's not doing too bad out of it.
8875752	8886197	Apparently the sale will reportedly net Viacom $150 million in tax benefits and considering it spent $175 million to buy the company in the first place, that's not bad.
8887157	8892239	Wow, so they're going to write off essentially on their taxes this year, Viacom.
8892540	8893760	I mean, Harmonix.
8894000	8894941	Viacom will write them off.
8895801	8896121	Wow.
8897262	8897582	Crazy.
8899013	8904235	I just hope that they can get the backing that they'll need to keep up with production and licensing and everything.
8904595	8910157	Where's the commercial on YouTube that's all QVC style where you can buy a video game publishing company for $49.99?
8912970	8915512	and the chicks who have no idea what they're talking about trying to explain it.
8915832	8918113	Have you ever watched them sell video games on QVC?
8919154	8920014	It makes my brain hurt.
8920255	8921976	It's so awesomely bad.
8921996	8923336	I don't watch TV, Rob.
8923437	8923977	Oh my God.
8923997	8925017	That should be a segment on our show.
8925038	8925998	I just watch Supernatural.
8926058	8927659	We're hard up for new segments on our show.
8927699	8933483	We need to start doing like QVC selling video games because it's hilarious how bad they are.
8934063	8941568	This game is called Shock Troopers and I think it's about getting electrocuted in the jungle while you're shooting guns.
8944291	8946392	This is a really fun game for the whole family.
8947613	8949774	And this game is called Resident Evil.
8949834	8951075	It's not bloody at all.
8951155	8952076	There's no zombies.
8952596	8956279	For you auto aficionados out here, Grand Theft Auto is perfect for you.
8956299	8957679	It has lots of cars in it.
8958440	8958960	And hookers.
8961962	8962863	I want to see really quick.
8962903	8964104	Do they have any on YouTube?
8964184	8964464	Hold on.
8965372	8967274	You know they've got everything on YouTube, Rob.
8967294	8968355	You're not going to have a problem.
8969596	8972178	Although, if you don't find anything, I will be surprised.
8973159	8976581	And there was the guy who broke the TV with the Wiimote on QVC.
8977362	8977682	Really?
8977802	8978463	That was pretty funny.
8982146	8985028	QVC Phineas and Ferb motion video game.
8985529	8986930	Phineas and Ferb is awesome!
8988601	8991642	I don't... This isn't actually a clip from QVC though.
8992442	8992863	I don't know.
8993103	8996224	Sadly, I don't... Chat room, you need to find me one so I can play it here on the show.
8996764	9001146	Okay, we got one more story for you guys and then we're going to open up the 877 number.
9001166	9005347	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9005727	9013130	Ooh, actually, I need to make sure that the 800 number is still working because it actually may have ran out tonight and I forgot to recharge it.
9013710	9014532	Silent Hill Downpour
9028812	9031594	Yep, that's the new name of the game, Silent Hill Downpour.
9032015	9034717	There's new information about this game in the latest Game Informer.
9035077	9040021	Apparently the town is huge, and you're going to use a subway system to get from one part of the town to another.
9040401	9043964	There's going to be a never-before-seen southeastern side of Silent Hill.
9044445	9046987	There is no hospitals or schools in that area.
9047787	9048808	So they're trying something new.
9049508	9052110	There will be optional side quests apparently in the game as well.
9052790	9055932	Combat will be from more like the earlier Silent Hill games.
9055992	9059934	You can avoid a lot of encounters and it's advised to avoid encounters.
9060314	9063376	You can only carry one melee weapon at a time, such as an axe.
9063816	9065197	The enemies are very hard to kill.
9065237	9066478	The weapons break easily.
9066758	9069840	The only fights you have to do in the game are boss battles.
9071000	9097663	Water is going to be an essential part of the game There's apparently a room in the game that has upside down running water on the ceiling Puzzles will be back to scaling difficulty levels So you can have easy puzzles or super hard puzzles So that's kind of cool because it sounds like they're going back to their roots a little bit But it sounds like they're mixing a little bit of old Silent Hill with open world quest driven games Like, I don't know, Warcraft, Borderlands, that type of thing So that's kind of neat, I gotta say
9098263	9100025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9117944	9121367	Actdeft in our chatroom says Silent Hill Downhill more like it.
9122648	9127953	Is that like the last game except they're replacing the snow with lots of rain?
9129515	9132197	I would have to give it a try.
9132317	9133098	I would have to give it a chance.
9133138	9134059	I've given the other ones a chance.
9134099	9134939	I'd have to give this a chance.
9136000	9137822	Because, I mean, Silent Hill, you know.
9139383	9143167	DDR Dollar Bill says Silent Hill Signs Edition.
9145033	9164911	I do like the idea of having the open universe so maybe me too maybe that will be the redeeming factor who knows what do you most want to see in a new Silent Hill game do you think they ought to just go back to Silent Hill 2 I want to see it produced by Konami in Japan that's what I most want to see
9166605	9168507	That's what it needs is to be back.
9168707	9176133	They need to beg Yamaoka to come back and they need to just get it back done the way they were doing them before.
9176173	9177234	They were doing them well.
9177534	9178415	Why did they screw up?
9179416	9181578	They shouldn't have ever sent the franchise to the U.S.
9182258	9183900	I mean as far as to be developed in the U.S.
9184280	9184900	That's what I'm saying.
9185401	9186522	It doesn't have the same feel anymore.
9187683	9187983	All right.
9189126	9218262	We are going to open up the Skype line right now Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR It does look like the number is working but the message I think is broken so if you call you're not going to get that little You've reached Orange Lounge Radio message line It's some generic thing right now so we'll look at that after the show why that's going on but otherwise you can give us a call right now 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Now there is a bit of delay between live and when the folks can actually start calling so I'll ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories
9218564	9223467	Yes, there's some new stuff developing on the 3D side of the PlayStation Network.
9223687	9228951	Apparently, they're going to start offering some 3D movies available on their service.
9229451	9238597	And one of those 3D movies is, yes, the 3D swimsuit video via, I believe, Sports Illustrated.
9238738	9242460	So you will be able to get 3D boobs on the PlayStation 3.
9243221	9244661	Not quite porn, but hey, whatever.
9246102	9247724	It's Cinemax-style porn.
9247984	9248224	Yes.
9249952	9251433	I don't know if you've seen this yet, Rob.
9251694	9253536	This is kind of scary.
9254137	9255839	Another Kinect hack.
9255879	9263989	Some guy has actually programmed the Kinect to allow him to play around with the figure of
9265820	9268582	Ivy from Soul Calibur with boob physics.
9268742	9277128	Well, lack of boob physics, but Soul Calibur boob physics, so he can move around with her boobs bouncing around.
9277248	9278729	Yay, boob simulations.
9278769	9280611	All right, we got a call coming in, so let's go to that real quick.
9280631	9281812	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9281852	9282212	Who's this?
9283273	9283753	Hi, it's D.D.
9283893	9284494	Odd Dollar Bill.
9284614	9284874	D.D.
9284954	9285654	Odd Dollar Bill.
9285694	9286615	How are you doing, my friend?
9287696	9288517	I'm doing all right, man.
9288697	9289177	Doing all right.
9289397	9289717	All right.
9289777	9290278	What's on your mind?
9291784	9297488	Uh, pretty much I was trying to send an email out to you guys, but I kept, I was trying to do it to the website, but I kept getting rejected.
9298168	9300450	So I figured, let me just call up and explain what's going on.
9300710	9305093	Weird, I don't know why the website's rejecting, but you know, the website had some major issues last week.
9305153	9307394	I guess some people started spamming our photo feed.
9307794	9309175	I missed, I totally missed this.
9309215	9311397	Like, Actdeft and Deekman took care of it when I wasn't listening.
9311817	9313438	But, uh, or watching, I should say.
9313478	9317401	But I guess, like, people were putting, like, weird, like, porno things in the picture feed.
9318041	9318501	And, uh...
9319562	9322325	You know I've threatened to pull the plug before if that shit starts happening.
9322385	9325347	However, I realize there's no one that actually listens to this show's fault.
9325708	9327029	But we have to keep an eye on that now.
9327189	9329691	So some of the things with the website might have got tweaked because of that.
9330112	9330752	Anyhow, what's on your mind?
9332474	9337438	Pretty much this is probably going to be the year that I'm going to really just stop gaming.
9337739	9338279	Video gaming.
9338319	9338499	What?
9338759	9339160	Why is that?
9340680	9369248	well the other day a couple days ago I was going to I was just listening to some old Nintendo games like some music you know the NSF files the emulators and I was just going back like what are some of the best things I remember about games and quite honestly today's games don't have any excitement to it they just there's nothing really exciting about playing them anymore there's no games that get you excited anymore what type okay let me ask you this what type of old Nintendo games did you like
9370926	9371967	Some memories, let's see.
9372748	9376611	I actually love the original Ninja Gaiden, for example, the trilogy.
9377171	9377432	Okay.
9378432	9379133	I love that.
9379974	9382195	Blaster Master was another popular one.
9383116	9383497	I agree.
9383537	9387320	That new Blaster Master game they made a little while ago wasn't nearly as good as the old one.
9387340	9388280	It was really unfortunate.
9388961	9390102	Oof, I haven't tried that yet.
9391103	9394145	But, yeah, like, what was another one I tried?
9394185	9397428	I mean, I can go to Genesis games like Phantasy Star 2, for example.
9399773	9402094	Those things gave me great memories.
9402415	9407538	They made me want to play it through no matter how bullshit hard it got.
9407578	9409279	They were just fantastic, those games.
9410500	9414743	Recently, no game really has actually grabbed my attention.
9415203	9419066	Maybe just one, but how many games get released a year?
9420146	9421167	That's a bad number.
9421267	9423469	Out of curiosity, what's the one game that grabbed your attention?
9424289	9425090	Red Dead Redemption.
9425623	9426143	Oh, okay.
9426203	9427524	Well, that was a pretty solid game.
9428285	9428725	Interesting.
9428785	9429205	And you know what?
9429405	9437190	You seem to really like exploring in games because a lot of those games you name, they all have to do something like you explore and you find new things as you go through the world.
9437550	9441732	Especially something like Red Dead Redemption is a lot about exploration.
9442113	9444674	So it sounds like these kind of open world games might kind of be your thing.
9444754	9445034	I don't know.
9445074	9446055	I'm just kind of guessing.
9446715	9447536	But what about like...
9447956	9451298	New games that kind of call back that retro style.
9451659	9455181	And I mean things like Bionic Commando Rearmed, we talked about earlier in the show.
9455201	9456202	It has a new release coming out.
9456842	9459384	Super Meat Boy, awesome throwback to retro games.
9459965	9460545	No interest there?
9461686	9466629	Okay, for Bionic Commando Rearmed, I loved that.
9466990	9469972	I eventually beat it, and it was a satisfying experience.
9470032	9470852	I really loved it.
9471433	9474515	Especially since I loved Bionic Commando since the arcade edition.
9475936	9477816	which most people are going to be like, there was an arcade?
9480577	9482537	I seem to recall one, I do.
9482957	9484698	And not even just the PayChoice10 one.
9484738	9487478	I think there was actually like a, I seem to recall what you're talking about.
9488518	9489479	Yeah, like that one.
9490519	9494060	Super Meat Boy is actually a very, very interesting case.
9495880	9501481	I tried a demo of it and I liked it but at the same time my thoughts were
9502503	9507452	Do I really want to go through the harder levels for reward that I'm not going to really enjoy?
9507472	9513122	I mean, you know, it's like, am I going to play this difficult game for the sake of it being difficult?
9513402	9515666	Or am I going to play it because I actually enjoy it?
9516894	9521056	You know, I see a comment in our chatroom, and I think this is a darn good piece of advice for you.
9521276	9526157	And Azam in our chatroom says, Someone get this man a near-lethal dose of indie gaming stat.
9526638	9532140	Maybe you're just fed up with what's in the mainstream and a lot of those games that, you know, cost $60 to find out a game sucks.
9532580	9535281	Have you thought about turning to the indie side of things a little bit?
9535321	9538582	Maybe exploring a little more what Steam or the Xbox Live Indie Arcades has?
9539202	9539403	on it.
9539683	9541425	Ah, that's another good point you guys bring up.
9542447	9551719	That's another point I was going to bring up because, yes, I've actually turned to indie gaming and I can tell you one other game that actually really caught my interest and I didn't really mention this and I got it remembering.
9552981	9553421	Amnesia.
9553481	9554002	You ever heard of it?
9554202	9554763	Yes, I have.
9555123	9556045	I have heard of Amnesia.
9556854	9557855	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9572869	9596640	I mean Super Meat Boy of sorts is an indie game as well there's a lot of these indie packs that are available on Steam I don't know you know it's not as cheap now as they were at Christmas time but things where you can get like you know kind of like a sampling of different types of games pretty cheap the humble indie bundle was out recently you know maybe there's more to look for in there where you don't feel like you're getting a shafted with the money you're spending
9597686	9600108	especially when it's like you can't really play much demos these days.
9601128	9601569	Absolutely.
9602810	9607513	Well, DDR Dollar Bill, I hope you find something to kind of change your mind a little bit.
9607713	9612896	There's so many types of games out there, but maybe it's just not going to be a AAA game from the developer.
9612916	9622943	But at the same time, you liked Red Dead Redemption, so I wouldn't look away completely from what the mainstream is doing because they'll be more like Red Dead soon, trust me.
9624249	9627590	Yeah, I guess it's just the start of the year, so I'll give it a chance.
9627710	9628170	That's true.
9628210	9629010	I think it'll be okay.
9629390	9633051	All right, DDR Dollar Bureau, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks for giving us a call.
9633431	9633851	Good topic.
9633891	9634571	No problem.
9634611	9635071	Later, guys.
9635351	9635571	Later.
9636491	9637592	All right, good call.
9637612	9638272	Let's go to another one.
9638312	9639252	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9639272	9639612	Who's this?
9640752	9641392	Hey, what's up, guys?
9641412	9642112	This is Taijudo.
9642572	9643213	Taijudo.
9643253	9643913	What's on your mind, buddy?
9645313	9646693	No, no.
9646733	9650234	Before I go into what I want to talk about, I just wanted to recommend...
9651914	9652214	Game.
9652354	9655980	Well, not actually a game, but what you guys were doing earlier where you were combining toys with games.
9656261	9657222	Yeah, yeah, what's that?
9657863	9662411	How about a chase in Will Warriors with the burnout engine?
9663574	9664635	Dude, sweet!
9666216	9666816	I like that.
9666836	9673700	You know, I'm kind of surprised we didn't get something in that whole racing game theme because there was so much good racing stuff.
9673960	9677482	You know, I did consider for a moment a Power Wheels racing game.
9679183	9682345	That thought did cross my mind, but I like your idea a lot.
9682465	9683685	Yeah, don't forget about Mask.
9683925	9684926	That was also great.
9685386	9688408	I don't know about the cartoon, but the toys were great.
9688488	9690089	But on to what I was going to talk about...
9690708	9697333	I don't know if there's still any people out there that were interested in the agency MMO that was supposed to come out like eons ago.
9697473	9698674	Yeah, whatever happened to that?
9698694	9699675	You guys remember this game?
9699695	9700355	You've been following this?
9700375	9703017	It's supposed to still, supposedly it's still in development.
9703117	9703998	I mean, I doubt that.
9704058	9707420	I mean, it's been a long time since we've heard anything from it.
9707501	9715486	But according to a lot of sources, they're all saying that the game's still coming out on PlayStation 3 and the PC, supposedly the PC before the PS3.
9716067	9717748	But I don't know.
9717768	9718469	That's kind of shaky.
9718489	9720090	But I do have some good news for people.
9720902	9742786	Who may be still interested in that game There's a Facebook app Made by the developers of that game That you can actually play now It's kind of like Mafia Wars You know, the whole tech space type deal But it's a lot of fun, the presentation is really great And I'm enjoying it Awesome So, I might have missed it Have they nailed a release window for this yet?
9742846	9744726	Or does it need to go through the extensive testing first?
9746367	9748927	That, I don't know I mean, you guys can look that up Um
9749460	9752642	As far as I know, they're reworking the game.
9752682	9757205	They weren't satisfied with what they originally had, the stuff that they were showing at E3.
9758126	9761448	And they're supposedly rebuilding a whole other type of game.
9761888	9763489	Because for whatever their reasons are,
9764289	9767812	I just hope they didn't take out the feature where there was supposed to be some feature where...
9792754	9794816	You could actually play the game through your cell phone.
9794836	9806246	You were supposed to take on these little, I guess you would call them microagents, and they were supposed to build cars and gadgets for you, and you were supposed to be able to manage that through your cell phone somehow.
9806967	9807887	I thought that was a great idea.
9807907	9817576	I like the fact that they were taking MMO in another direction, so hopefully they're not coming out with just something like APB, where you're just running and gunning, and a whole lot of BS.
9818656	9824164	I really like that idea of interacting with the cell phones more and other types of things like that.
9824224	9829251	I think that's a really good use of... Sorry about that.
9829772	9830914	Somebody sent me a YouTube link.
9831314	9832175	I brought it up a little soon.
9838556	9840577	Sorry, that totally threw me.
9840637	9841337	Way to go!
9842157	9843578	I know, gosh, sorry about that.
9844238	9850880	But that's kind of the way games like Warcraft and so forth are going where they're fully interactive with all these different types of platforms like the mobile phones and everything.
9852220	9854101	Yeah, I think that's the way to go.
9854541	9864444	Like I said, I don't know if you remember what I called last week and I'm all about game innovation and I kind of agree with your previous caller that games need to be a little more innovative.
9864524	9866165	I mean, I'm not going to quit gaming anytime soon
9866747	9873049	but they do need to come out with something more than just Call of Duty and all the other bullshit that they're coming out with.
9873389	9876050	I want them to really take advantage of what we have now.
9876270	9879451	We have motion control crap, we have HD crap.
9879491	9881791	There's just so much that they can do with it.
9881811	9891154	I know that it's a whole money management thing and there's a memory thing and there's a lot of balancing things that you have to do with the games but I know that they can do a lot better than what they're doing now.
9892106	9919684	They can at least try Alright Alright, well we'll be keeping an eye on this game It does appear they're still targeting the second half of 2011 for this But it'll be done when it's done, darn it Yeah, and oh, that name of the app is The Agency Covert Ops Look for that on Facebook, that's the name of it That is available on Facebook And looks like it's been up since May of last year Missions, minigames, and sharing achievements with Facebook friends
9920970	9922632	I'm going to hang up and let the next caller come in.
9945174	9946775	Some stuff coming out of CES.
9947596	9958803	They're talking a little bit about Avatar Connect, which is going to be kind of a new chat method that you can use to actually chat with people and recognize facial expressions and stuff like that.
9959303	9962265	So kind of mapping your voice to your avatar, which is kind of neat.
9963105	9966408	and they'll be available for gold numbers later this spring.
9966448	9968649	You'll use it once and then the thrill will be over.
9968689	9971431	But I do like the idea like you can like publish it to Facebook and stuff.
9971491	9974293	I'll bet you we're going to start seeing podcasts recorded like this.
9974353	9977575	We should do an episode of OLR like this, like a bonus episode of OLR.
9977856	9978516	That would be funny.
9978596	9979457	That would be kind of funny.
9980117	9982339	That's like the one thing we have to do and then that'll be it.
9983600	9985681	And the other thing, I don't know if this pissed you off, Rob.
9986162	9989244	They're talking about bringing Game Room to the Windows Phone 7.
9992006	9993507	TurboGrafx Games coming to the Playstation Network
10018484	10021605	So you can play games like Keith Courage that weren't very good.
10022665	10024266	Yeah, these are from Hudson.
10024286	10025106	Don't get me started.
10025386	10028027	Alien Crush, Bomberman 94, Box Adventure.
10028107	10029527	Some of them were good.
10030068	10039791	Dungeon Explorer, New Adventure Islands, Soldier Blades, Superstar Soldier, Victory Run, World Sports Competition, and Newtopia.
10039811	10041051	All right, I got a call waiting.
10041071	10043372	Newtopia is a great game, and it's a lot like Zelda.
10043492	10044272	Let me go to the phones.
10044512	10046093	Haven't you done a classic game of the week?
10046113	10047053	I think I have done Newtopia.
10047253	10048794	Let me go to the phones because I got somebody waiting.
10048834	10049814	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10049834	10050214	Who's this?
10050774	10051655	Hey, this is X-Link.
10051695	10052215	Hey, X-Link.
10052235	10052915	What's on your mind, buddy?
10053375	10054055	Hey, nothing much.
10054115	10059137	You know, sometimes games and stuff, sometimes I can understand the other color a while back.
10059197	10063599	I mean, there's been times when I step back from playing video games for a while because, you know, you get burned out.
10063639	10065920	You play stuff, you know, you think a lot of stuff comes out.
10065940	10066920	It's the same thing.
10067000	10072282	It's, you know, you know, I take a few days off, maybe read some books.
10072362	10074083	You know, they come back and do something else.
10074163	10074603	But, you know,
10075844	10102945	I'm sure there's something out there for a little bit for everyone and yeah and as I was telling you earlier they should make Millie Bourne into another PC game if they I mean I know there was one a long time ago but I think they should make that into another one I have a indie app on my iTouch that I bought from the store that was 99 cents that was kind of the card game though it's not the official version but it plays the same way which is really cool
10104546	10107408	You know, I like playing all kinds of different stuff.
10107448	10118177	Roleplaying, card games, you know, games like Super Meat Boy, Nick's Quest was another good one I had played for a bit, you know, first person shooters.
10119057	10126123	So when I get bored of one thing, I kind of switch it around to another thing so that way I don't get too burnt out on playing one genre of a
10127243	10128924	That's not bad advice at all.
10129064	10140507	And especially, you know, with thanks to the magic of emulators, or I'm sorry, virtual console, you know, you can have a variety of different games, you know, especially the old school stuff, you know, because that's what our listener seemed to enjoy that you can go back and forth to.
10140827	10146228	You know, one odd suggestion maybe I would have for that listener, and maybe this is one of those things where I'll get laughed out of the room.
10146648	10171049	but maybe that person should try an MMO maybe if games were a little more social I don't know like for me like WoW being the big social thing it is kind of keeps me is what keeps me coming back to that game but at the same time and there's a lot of free ones too there's I mean I used to play before I played WoW I played a Persona one that they had that was totally free so I mean
10172077	10175958	You don't have to really pay to play, so to speak.
10176258	10177619	There's a lot of free stuff out there.
10177859	10182740	It might be another niche or something else totally different out there.
10182780	10186821	I don't think there's anything wrong, though, with the advice of, if you think you're bored of video games, take a break.
10187021	10187901	There's nothing wrong with it.
10187921	10189382	You don't have to game every single day.
10189402	10190542	I'm not going to think any less of you.
10190602	10191762	None of us will.
10191862	10192983	That's not true, but that's all right.
10193003	10193083	Stop.
10194163	10197086	Go watch some movies or catch up on TV shows.
10197766	10199148	Go read a book.
10199328	10200729	Go start another project.
10201109	10203772	And then maybe you'll find that game that wants to bring you back.
10204692	10209937	You know, it's kind of interesting, too, when you're talking about this whole, you know, about being lazy and stuff.
10209977	10211518	It's because mostly because technology.
10211578	10218804	Our technology has grown so rapidly, so quickly, and it's so easy to access a lot of different stuff so quickly.
10219125	10219285	Like,
10219765	10221647	Why do I need to go to the library to check out a book?
10221707	10226192	I can go online and buy the book straight from Amazon and get it right here in my own living room.
10227173	10234441	Unfortunately, with technology, there's always pros and cons to everything.
10234481	10240968	Unfortunately, a pro thing is it's quicker and easier, but a con is that we don't do as much as we used to.
10242009	10248494	We get to a point in society now it's like we want things almost virtually handed to us because we're like, well, we can get this this way.
10248514	10249575	Why can't we do this?
10250216	10260184	I've got to admit I've bought a book on my iPhone before and one of the reasons I kind of like that sort of technology is that I have the book with me everywhere I go in case I'm ever bored.
10260604	10262386	That way I'm not carrying around a bulky book.
10263807	10267650	That's kind of the one really advantage I like of having it on there.
10267990	10272712	But I do also understand, you know, there's really no substitute for an old dusty book.
10273392	10273612	Yeah.
10274333	10276333	So, I mean, but, you know, I still read books.
10276373	10280155	I have plenty of books on my shelf that I read that's actual physical books.
10280275	10281976	I mean, you know, not everything is the e-book.
10282016	10283236	It's clearly my strategy guides.
10283276	10290979	I mean, I have a lot of limited edition strategy guides that I like to have just for, you know, collector's edition just for, you know, to have on my shelves because I like looking at them.
10291120	10294361	So, I mean, you know, so, I mean, there's...
10295274	10315126	It's kind of funny when you're saying that because that brought me back to the whole thing back when I was taking technology ed class in high school and we're talking about, you know, because of all these pros there's going to be cons, you know, like fast food and movies and now we got books and video games and, you know, we don't have to do as much as we used to to get what we want.
10315246	10319228	It's okay, I press a few buttons or click on a few things and boom, there it is, so.
10321340	10322282	Boom, there it is.
10322442	10324465	That's definitely the culture we live in now.
10326569	10330015	Alright, X-Link, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for the call as always.
10331885	10334088	And how proud are you of Jamie and her level 63?
10334128	10335088	I'm very proud of her.
10335489	10336570	30 levels in one week.
10336650	10339092	Jesus, I can't do anything more.
10339152	10340373	You might get explicit for it.
10340874	10342796	Yeah, but, yeah, damn.
10343416	10344577	That's all I'm going to say is damn.
10344597	10345718	I couldn't believe that.
10345738	10347180	30 levels in almost a week.
10347700	10349082	That was just amazing.
10349282	10351684	That really, congratulations.
10351904	10352345	Thank you.
10352745	10354347	And thank you as well for the gift.
10354867	10355908	I don't want to say anything.
10376909	10378510	Play a game how you want to play a game.
10378550	10379111	That's fine.
10379151	10392005	But just for you to blow through 30 levels in a week just kind of made me laugh a little bit because I'm just kind of like, man, I know other people that are just like they don't even do a level a month.
10392546	10396410	I'm still going to see if it's possible for me to make 85 before classes start next week.
10396775	10405739	Well, it took me to get, it almost took me a year to get to 80, but that's only because I was only playing a few times a week, and I was just doing it a few hours a day.
10405999	10410542	But then again, how was I getting to 82, Rob, again, when I got Kata?
10410982	10411982	Archeology whoring.
10412022	10413263	That's right, there we go.
10413603	10414383	Non-stop.
10414584	10416064	So, yeah, that was a lot of fun.
10416204	10417545	You guys are going to have to show me the ropes.
10418165	10418846	Oh, I will.
10418866	10425609	The one thing, though, is that, and this is, I think, what chased me off before, is the whole feeling like I'm being forced to play with people.
10426389	10426730	You know?
10427530	10428672	Just do whatever you want to do.
10428812	10433176	Like I said before, you had to open the invitation to our raids on Wednesday, and if you want to, that's fine.
10433196	10434077	If you don't, you don't.
10434237	10435338	There's no right or wrong.
10435679	10436059	Well, no.
10436399	10437641	I understand that.
10437801	10444948	I've been getting the, oh, the whole game experience is when you're playing with doing, you know, the dungeon thing with a lot of people, and...
10445362	10447623	I'm like, I've been enjoying playing by myself.
10447823	10448903	I like playing with one or two people.
10448923	10455344	Really quickly, and I'm not going to say too much on this because I know people are going to get shut off, but just like, oh shit, they're talking about WoW.
10455764	10465527	Rob invited me to WoW a year ago, and when I started playing, I thought for sure that it was going to be kind of like, okay, Rob's going to show me ropes, and I'm going to do all this stuff, and this is going to be great, and blah, blah, blah.
10465567	10466667	And I know Rob had his own thing.
10466687	10469788	He was really busy with work and whatnot.
10469828	10474129	Rob contestants, there were times when I had played with them, but for the most part, between me getting to 1 in 80...
10475389	10483333	was, other than the help from another guildie of ours, whoever my name was, that I did 90% of that stuff on my own.
10484414	10500262	I went through, I went through all the pugging stuff, through the dungeons and everything else, but for most parts, I did non-stop questing from day one when I started to when I got to like 80.
10502023	10504484	Among a few odds and ends and PvP and whatnot, but
10506827	10508589	I had a lot of fun playing by myself.
10508769	10510431	That's one of the few games I can actually say.
10510471	10512694	You can play by yourself and have a lot of fun doing it.
10514316	10514977	That's what I like.
10517240	10519602	I need to play with six of my friends in order to get this done.
10520512	10521873	But it is fun to play with your friends, too.
10521893	10523514	That's what keeps me in WoW is raiding.
10523534	10524335	Definitely, by far.
10525256	10531100	Alright, well, anyhow, I gotta let you go before we have Horde House to spin off here, but thank you so much for your call, okay, buddy?
10531620	10532601	Anytime, anytime.
10532641	10532861	Later.
10534002	10542849	I think pretty soon, especially when you hit about maybe level 70 or so, we're gonna have to, well, maybe soon, we'll have to run you into some dungeons and show you the ropes in dungeons.
10543750	10549654	I just want to basically learn how to play with other people so if I decide that I want to be social, that I'm not going to kill everybody.
10549994	10554397	Because I have a problem of accidentally casting my area of effect.
10554458	10563163	The dark side of pug groups is that they're not always noob friendly and they expect that you know everything and you may not and that's very unfortunate.
10563203	10564905	But anyway, let's move on.
10565045	10566406	I don't want to get too far into wild talk.
10567487	10567767	All right.
10567847	10569289	That's going to do it, though, for the Skype line tonight.
10569310	10571092	Thank you guys so much for your calls.
10571212	10571993	Really appreciate it.
10572474	10578162	If you didn't get through, send us an email, mailbag at orangeloundtrader.com or a tweet at twitter.com slash OLR.
10578182	10579985	There's plenty of ways to interact with our program.
10580245	10581627	There's also the live chat room every week.
10582188	10584568	DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?
10584588	10589509	85 by Wednesday Good luck Not 85, I meant 65 Oh yeah, you can do it 65 by tomorrow I don't know your schedule, maybe
10612020	10612580	Destiny 63.
10613921	10615042	Loki, what's your final thought?
10617243	10617603	I don't know.
10617803	10618163	Tron.
10619824	10625027	My final thought is Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie.
10625047	10626108	She just came waddling out.
10626328	10626628	That's right.
10626668	10628109	Now she's just sitting there waiting to poop.
10629530	10630490	Hey, baby cakes.
10631431	10631751	All right.
10631771	10632591	Can you say something to everybody?
10632611	10633652	Let's talk about the tester.
10633672	10636594	Say something to the listeners, baby.
10637154	10639095	I don't think Shermie is very talkative.
10640812	10641813	Jeremy's like, what the hell is that?
10641853	10642654	Get that out of my face.
10642994	10643575	No comment.
10644315	10644575	All right.

10662551	10663472	Thank you guys again.
10663572	10664553	Have a wonderful week.

10665453	10667015	We're going to be back here to do it all again.
10667853	10671796	with a three-day weekend, by the way, for me next week.
10671816	10671876	Woo!
10672116	10672576	Drunk show.
10672596	10675738	You never know what antics might, if I could get a ride home somehow.
10676999	10678180	You can sleep on the couch.
10678320	10679641	You never know what antics might happen.
10679661	10680481	You can sleep in the vault and freeze.
10680501	10682223	Do you want to do a drunk show next week that bad?
10682603	10683103	Will you drink?
10683123	10684184	I know he won't.
10684224	10684564	He can't.
10684584	10686225	He's got to be a responsible daddy, but will you?
10686365	10686846	Maybe I will.
10687486	10688307	Okay.
10688767	10695374	Because it's been that long, I will get nice and toasty on air for listeners if I can figure out a ride home or something.
10695754	10695974	Okay.
10696114	10698216	So maybe I'll see if somebody can drive me to the show.
10698236	10698537	We'll see.
10698897	10699117	Okay.
10699398	10699638	All right.
10701359	10703161	So lots to look forward to next week.
10703181	10703922	Yeah, warn Dan.
10704182	10704823	Good night, everybody.
10705808	10708510	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
