00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
This is episode number 399 for January 30th, 2011.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games with the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hi.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Hi, how are you?

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I am doing better than I was.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Yeah, I've heard you've been kind of sick lately. I'm sorry to hear about it.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Yeah, but I has warm drink. Thank you.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh, you're welcome.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
And I have my fuzzy blue binky.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Not a Snuggie, but it kind of looks like one from far away.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
It's very soft fleece and I think that I got this as a freebie from somewhere, but it's been super soft and goes with me on trips.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
And it's like my comfort blanket.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Have you ever thought about investing in a Snuggie?

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
I saw one once. It was a knockoff with Kingdom Hearts patterns all over it. It did make me think of you a little bit.

01:22.000 --> 01:32.000
I don't know. I like my blanket. If it was the same softness as this blanket. See, my blanket's really soft.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Oh, this is great radio, me feeling the blanket. Yes, there you go.

01:35.000 --> 01:44.000
If it was just like this blanket, then maybe I could be convinced. But I kind of like being shrouded in my warm blanket and being able to pull it over my head if I want to.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Is it like a Linus from the Peanuts thing where it's like your security blanket has to go with you everywhere?

01:48.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, no. But it makes me feel comforted when I feel weak and sick. And then I can use my really low warm blanket.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
I just realized I touched that blanket when you were sick. I really hope I don't get it.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
It's been washed, Rob.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Alright, let's also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Hi.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
How are you, Loki?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Sick as well.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, no.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I caught my son's cold.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Oh my gosh.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
The plague.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
That's alright.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
I feel like I'm marked because I haven't been sick yet. Dot, dot, dot. I really hope I don't get anything.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Well, sorry to hear about you being sick as well. I hope you get over it.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah, it's fine.

02:26.000 --> 02:38.000
But I have to point out, just before the show started while Bobby's show was finishing up here live at All Games Radio, you were giggling like a schoolgirl over there playing, what was it, Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah, episodes of Liberty City.

02:40.000 --> 02:49.000
And it was really funny because you were listening to some gay dance music or something in the game while you were just blowing up.

02:49.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah, I was listening to the Russian electronic station in the game and then I was playing, well, I was working on map edits and then I decided, because I still have the crazy car handling in place still, that I'd play around with that, so that's what I was doing.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Gotcha.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Well, it looked like you were having fun because you were giggling as your car was spinning around and around and around and around.

03:15.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah, you're not supposed to be able to get into those cars because they go crazy, but since I have the trainer, I can spawn cars and make it so I don't fall off of motorcycles and stuff. It's fun.

03:26.000 --> 03:34.000
Alright, and also joining us tonight, of course, you guys, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, as they have over the past, what, nine years we've been doing this show.

03:34.000 --> 03:47.000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com if you are listening to us live because we do tape live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:47.000 --> 03:58.000
And yes, we are doing a show next week, which is very brave because we are going to compete against Super Bowl Sunday in some ways. I don't know, I think most of it's wind down. I think they're in like the last quarter by the time this show starts.

03:58.000 --> 04:16.000
But next week's kind of a big deal for us because it's episode number 400. I don't think we're going to do anything too special. We might have some surprises in store, little things, but you know, we don't want to do because then we could do, we could do a 400th special, then we could do a ninth anniversary special, then we could do a 10th anniversary, you know, we don't want to overdo it with the special.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I like 10 aversaries.

04:17.000 --> 04:25.000
Every week is special. Dang it. So we appreciate you guys listening to us over the past few years. Really appreciate it.

04:25.000 --> 04:37.000
We're going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com. Tigerclaw says, it's funny that Snuggies have taken off considering the Slanket was the first one to come up with the idea. And Jim Sally says, Snuggies now with 10% more Slanket.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
So is Snuggie like the Zynga of the blanket making world? I don't know. Take with that what you will.

04:44.000 --> 04:56.000
Alright, let's get into the show and talk about some video games and how is your gaming week and the types of video games you have been playing since you guys have been sick. I don't know if you guys have been playing some games, but let's see.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Dark Soccer, what have you been up to?

04:57.000 --> 05:16.000
I've really just played World of Warcraft. Addicts. Dealer. Because I hate Icecrown. And I hated it so much that I was like, I just need to power level through it, need to get through with it, need to get through with it. I'm done.

05:16.000 --> 05:27.000
And I have to thank Alan, by the way, for running me through that. I don't think it was a dungeon, but it was like some tournament area. And I think it was in Zildrak.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Oh yeah, the Ring of Blood or whatever it's called.

05:30.000 --> 05:53.000
I could get the Slobberknocker. But it got me a crap ton of experience on top of it. So that saved me a couple hours of work and stupid quests to control water elementals, which sucked. And now I just did the joust thing.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah, there's a little parody. And she's not talking like an actual joust thing, although that's in the game too.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
You ride a griffin.

05:59.000 --> 06:06.000
But there's like a make-believe 3D version of the old school 80s game, joust.

06:06.000 --> 06:24.000
And you get a pet from it that's one of the little griffins with a dude on it with a lance. And you get to keep the lance. Although I'm gonna sell it for probably nothing that's worse. It's like a zero to one damage item, which makes me laugh.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
And I'm actually having a really good time in the really pretty Cataclysm area. It's just really pretty.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
Flowers and fairy dragons. I love fairy dragons. And I'll tell you why I love fairy dragons. From D&D.

06:36.000 --> 06:45.000
My friend played a fairy dragon named Shimata Hentai. So I thought it was funny. And I'm done. I'm high on Sudafed.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
It's gonna be a fun show!

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Sudafed, Robitussin, and Benadryl.

06:48.000 --> 06:56.000
Do you find that, wow, I'm still blown away every week this goes on. That you were a wow hater in 2010.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
I wasn't a hater.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Yes you were. You turned it all around in 2011.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I wasn't a hater.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Okay, you were a disliker.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I was just bored by it.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Disliker's gonna dislike.

07:07.000 --> 07:20.000
Well, you know me. I'm gonna give something a chance before I decide that I hate it. And enough, like I said enough, people said it's different that I had to give it a chance.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Speaking of MMOs, I gotta go to a comment from Tigerclaw in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchrader.com.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.000
He says his gaming week pretty much consisted of playing DC Universe online. Still haven't reached level 30. I think I'm around level 16 or 15.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
So I've gotta kinda ask, are there any other MMOs? Cause I know you're a comic book, even though you're not so much DC. I know you're more of a Marvel girl.

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
Do any of these other MMOs interest you? And you've talked also about maybe I need to go back to Star Trek Online and check out what's going on there.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
Well, I missed on Star Trek Online. And I do miss my fleet. They're cool guys.

07:52.000 --> 08:04.000
I do want to go back to Star Trek Online for a month to see the new episodes. But I don't know. I mean, it really got to be super redundant.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
And there's been enough different stuff going on in World of Warcraft that I think it's gonna keep my attention.

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
Cause I just get bored doing the same thing over and over again. Which is why I was really, really bored in Icecrown.

08:17.000 --> 08:27.000
Except, I mean, once I got through all the cool Arthas stuff, I was like, ugh, boring. And I forgot to make him dance. See if I can make him dance.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
But, um, I've liked all the little neat throwing stuff and I really haven't had enough of that in Star Trek Online.

08:34.000 --> 08:43.000
I'm gonna give it another go. I mean, I love Star Trek Online. It was fun. I love everything about it. Except that I've run out of shit to do.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Except the endgame got old, basically.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, pretty much. And I don't like PVP. I hate PVP.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
I'm kinda curious what you're gonna think of the endgame a while because I know you haven't done a lot of the grouping.

08:53.000 --> 09:02.000
And to be honest, there's not a whole lot else to do. Well, I take that back. They've done a lot of stuff when it comes to reputations and crafting.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
And there's kinda that to do. There's a lot of daily quests you can do. But I worry you're gonna find yourself a little bored when you get to the endgame.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
Because even I'm getting a little bored at the endgame right now because our guild lost some people after the expansion just due to real life stuff.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
And we haven't had enough to do any of the raiding, which is the big stuff you do.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
Well, see, that's why I want you guys to show me the ropes. So that, you know, Wednesdays are gonna be bad.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
It's the Rope Robot School of Warcraft!

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Well, Wednesdays are gonna be bad for me because I have school until 1030.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
But I wanna eventually get into it. You know, I got so wrapped up in questing and it was so much fun to me.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
And I've got a Worgen now.

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
I gotta make my shopping list over here for WoW School. Okay, buy Sorting Hat for Jamie.

09:50.000 --> 09:57.000
I have a Worgen now though. Because while I was feeling so sick and miserable, Dan decided to cheer me up by getting me Cataclysm.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
And then promptly yelled at me for playing too much Warcraft.

10:00.000 --> 10:07.000
But I named her Veruca Salt. With two A's. Veruca Salt.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Veruca! Alright.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Because I couldn't get Volkswagen.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
Alright, enough MMO chat. Let's go over to Loki. I know he doesn't play any of them right now, so I'll ask him what he's been playing this week, Loki.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
I've been playing, um, not a whole lot actually. Just, you know, mainly like Grand Theft Auto stuff because that's fun.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
Just been dealing with... I had my JTAG system repaired and it died in five minutes when I got it back.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
So I was like, uh, that sucks. So I sent it away to get it fixed again.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
Um, I did play some stuff on the iPod yesterday actually. I played...

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
And you may remember this from when we were talking about it during one...

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
It was a news segment we brought up.

10:46.000 --> 10:56.000
The game Hamlet. Or was it the last game not to feature MMO shading and some other elements or something like that?

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
I vaguely remember a story on this. So I remember making the comment like,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
how in the hell are they gonna make a game out of that? That sounds...

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It was actually pretty awesome.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Some college kids project gone pretty long.

11:06.000 --> 11:14.000
Yes. Hamlet or the last game without MMO RPG features, shaders, and product placement. HD was the game that I played.

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
And, um, basically it's like a point and click adventure game, except really dumbed down. In a way.

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
Um, it's dumbed down the fact that you don't have an inventory. You don't have any real exploration or anything.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
It's just okay. It's one level, and then the next room you're in, and the next room you're in, and you have to solve a puzzle in each one.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
And there's about 20 some rooms.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
So I was able to finish the game in like three to four hours.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
But, um, it's really got a unique style to it. I mean, it's not...

11:45.000 --> 11:54.000
It is Hamlet, and it's not. It's like, um, if the creators of Ren and Stimpy created a version of Hamlet, it's basically that.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
It's just weird.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I love Ren and Stimpy. It's powdered toast, man!

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
No, seriously, the art style kind of reminds me of, like, Ren and Stimpy. It's just very weird.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Okay, now I'm interested.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Um, but it's...

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Who from our generation didn't love Ren and Stimpy?

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, you play this, like, um...

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
What rolls downstairs, hops over in pairs, runs over your neighbor's dog.

12:20.000 --> 12:32.000
You play this, like, time traveler or whatever who comes back to, I guess, Hamlet and accidentally crushes Hamlet, and he, you know, he's injured, so you have to basically do all the things Hamlet would have had to do.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
And they've already teased a sequel, which is gonna be Romeo and Juliet.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Hamlet 2?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
There's gonna be Romeo and Juliet.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Hamlet 2, Electric Boogaloo.

12:39.000 --> 12:47.000
Bummer, because the Hamlet 2 movie is one of those movies. I actually watched the movie. Do you know they have, like, a movie called Hamlet 2, and it's about a guy who's putting on stage? It's a comedy.

12:47.000 --> 12:54.000
And, like, it's actually not very funny, but it's one of those things that's, like, so stupid, you kind of laugh in some parts.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Rock me, Rock me, Rock me, Jesus.

12:55.000 --> 13:04.000
Yeah, Rock me, Sexy Jesus. Like, it's so absurd, you have to laugh, because this movie clearly was just set out to offend people. And that was kind of funny.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
Uh, but yeah, the game's pretty awesome. The only problem I have is that it's short, and once you've beaten it, there's really no reason to play it again.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
So...

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Is it a free game, though?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
No.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Oh.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
But it's cheap.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Okay. Well, as long as you kind of get what you pay for, so to speak.

13:17.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah. But it was a good game. It's just, it's, um, and some of the puzzles are pretty hard. You have to think about it, and they give you a little hint, but that hint sometimes doesn't really help you.

13:28.000 --> 13:37.000
Um, but you can usually figure it out pretty quick. I mean, I played the whole game through without using any sort of, you know, cheats or anything.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
Is Telltale in trouble? I mean, they are the kings of the whole point-and-clicky games right now.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
No, it's a little different than that.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Okay.

13:44.000 --> 13:55.000
It's more of like, you know, someone that hasn't really played an adventure game. I mean, it's very, okay, you solve this puzzle in this stage, you move to the next stage, and you solve this next puzzle, and they have little boss fights and stuff like that.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Okay.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
And the boss fights are just very, very odd. The whole game is very odd.

14:00.000 --> 14:15.000
Spaznator's in our chatroom saying that he bought some Ren and Stimpy episodes via PSN. I had no idea. See, I wouldn't know what the hell was on the PSN video store if we didn't have Spaznator in our chatroom every week or on Twitter or wherever he's at, because I never pay attention to what's on it.

14:15.000 --> 14:24.000
I had no idea you could get Ren and Stimpy episodes. Can you even get those on Netflix? I don't even know. Like, I'm sure they're all on DVD, but they're probably all over YouTube as well. I don't know.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
All right. Anything else for your gaming week you want to share with us, Loki?

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
No, no, that would be it.

14:31.000 --> 14:44.000
Okay. My gaming week. Didn't play a whole lot of new stuff. I'm kind of having to penny-pinch right now, so I don't have a lot of money to spend $60 on new games, so it's kind of playing the games I have, which is WoW and some of the, you know, Xbox Live Arcade games.

14:44.000 --> 14:55.000
But this is funny that I'm going to talk about penny-pinch and then talk about what I just did this weekend. But I took, like, a real quick suicide trip to Disneyland. That's where I was the past couple days.

14:55.000 --> 15:02.000
That's not why there wasn't a Hoard House this week, though. We had a plan, but unfortunately, Plan B fell through. We'll get to that on that show.

15:02.000 --> 15:14.000
However, yeah, I went to Disneyland, and when I was there, part of the reason I wanted to go was to see this whole Electronica event that they had. They had a Tron-themed dance party rave that they turned a whole section of Disneyland into.

15:14.000 --> 15:24.000
And yes, this is video game related because they have several little attractions going on. Most of it is to just kind of draw people into California Adventure before World of Color starts, which is their big, big thing.

15:24.000 --> 15:35.000
And California Adventure is kind of the struggling Disney park right now. While it has a few big, big rides that people love, like Tower of Terror and California Screamin', there's not a lot of reason for people to, like, stay there like they do Disneyland.

15:35.000 --> 15:43.000
So Electronica's kind of a way to bring them in there. And they have a couple neat things. Like, they have a nine-minute preview of Tron Legacy, which is, you know, what you would expect to see in, like, a...

15:43.000 --> 15:54.000
They turn the Muppets Theater into the Tron Theater, which is kind of funny. But they do, like, lighting effects where when the recognizer comes out, the whole theater glows red. Kind of cute little things like that.

15:54.000 --> 16:04.000
But I'll tell you what was awesome and what has to do with gaming is that they took one of the old buildings that I believe way back in the day used to be the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire experience that didn't last very long.

16:04.000 --> 16:16.000
And that building's just been empty for the longest time. Well, guess what they turned it into? Flynn's Arcade. They have a replica of Flynn's Arcade complete with old-school 80s arcade games.

16:16.000 --> 16:28.000
And get this, because it's Disney and because, you know, everything has to work at Disneyland, it all works. Like, it's a classic arcade game where all these games feel like they're in, like, mint freaking condition.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
That's fantastic.

16:29.000 --> 16:35.000
I know. Like, there's just not a lot like it. There's very few arcades that take good care of their retro machines like that.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Did they say how long it's gonna be there?

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
It's guaranteed right now on the calendars through March 25th.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
That means we should be there when we go...

16:43.000 --> 16:52.000
But people are thinking, like, oh, maybe it's not gonna last through April when the Blu-ray's coming out. But my other thought is what are they gonna replace it with?

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
Electronica replaced what they called Glowfest, which was the same type of thing, really. It just didn't have a Tron theme to it.

16:59.000 --> 17:07.000
And when you see the Tron stuff, it's pretty rad what they did. But there's not a whole lot else to see besides that classic arcade and everything.

17:07.000 --> 17:20.000
But it's crazy because this arcade is full of people. There is a freaking line to play the Tron game, which they have perfectly placed in the back with a little subtle cutout in the wall.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
Once in a while, you'll see things glowing behind. I mean, it's perfect, this replica they've set up.

17:25.000 --> 17:34.000
And they even created... This is the thing that just freaked me out. They created a game called Space Paranoids that they have in an arcade machine.

17:34.000 --> 17:43.000
And it's clearly running on a PC because it doesn't use tokens, but it's like in a cabinet. And it's like a 3D game where you go around and shoot recognizers, but you only have so many bullets.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
It's pretty hot.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
I think that's their browser. They had a browser game that was like that.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
Yeah, it's probably just the browser game like as an arcade machine, so that's what that is.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
And I played Dig Dug, which is one of my favorite classic games. Tease me if you will.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
But I walked out of there with the number one score on the machine, thank you very much.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Nice.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
So yeah, I don't know if it resets every night or what, but hey, I was happy for a minute.

18:09.000 --> 18:15.000
So it's whatever makes you happy, I guess. Even some pinball! They had a Whirlwind machine. Or what is that called? The one that blows the air on you?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Yeah, that's Whirlwind.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah, pinball machine.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
That's Whirlwind.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah, some of that too. And they play 80s music very loudly while you're in there.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Lots of journey.

18:23.000 --> 18:33.000
Yes. Like I heard of Bananarama and some of the stuff. But every time they play Journey is when the arcade will start flickering and kind of doing that very Disney effect.

18:33.000 --> 18:39.000
If you are anywhere near SoCal, you gotta see it. Like if you're an arcade enthusiast, you gotta see it.

18:39.000 --> 18:51.000
Like just at least once. It's a pretty cool thing to behold. I mean I can't say like it's a loan worth the, what is it, $90 price it costs for a one day park hopper or whatever.

18:51.000 --> 18:58.000
That's pushing it. But if you're gonna be going to Disneyland anyway, you gotta like make sure you're gonna see this somehow.

18:58.000 --> 19:06.000
I really hope that they went to all this work, that they just keep it open. Like really, they weren't using that building for anything else.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Just keep the damn thing open until you have something really, really good to replace it.

19:10.000 --> 19:17.000
Because it looks like they spent a lot of money converting that building into Flynn's arcade. Don't, I mean even if they're gonna end Electronica, keep the freaking arcade.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Don't get rid of it. Please Disney.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
So, yeah. Folks in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchrader.com.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
Shezro says, wow, Flynn's replica. Nice. Yeah, I agree. It was pretty awesome.

19:29.000 --> 19:36.000
Let's see. Bochikawa says, that sounds awesome. It was pretty awesome. I mean it was crowded though. I mean, gosh.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
I only had time to really play like the one game. So there you go.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
Tigerclaw says, Skye, are they blasting the Daft Punk soundtrack all over the park?

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
Actually, no. They don't. They do some of it, especially during the pre-show leading up to it.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
But you know, when the dance party's going on, it's mostly Top 40 remix stuff.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
But they have people decked out in Tron outfits that are like up there dancing.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
And I felt kind of cool because when I say cool, like this is like super nerdy.

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
But I actually bought a replica identity disc that glows up when you hit a button on it.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
And I was like carrying that around with me and my friend Melody who I was there with.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Because this is kind of our makeup trip from her birthday.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
When the, I don't know if you remember this episode of OLR, when the plane caught on fire before us. Yeah.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
This is our makeup trip because we didn't get to go that weekend.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
She had two of the discs. One blue and one orange and like everybody was coming up to her asking her like where she got the discs.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
And it was just from the freaking souvenir stores. And you can get the blue ones at Target actually.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
They have them at Toys R Us.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah. So they're not hard to find but it's just kind of funny.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
So Zeba wants to know if I took any pics. Yes I did. I actually took some video too.

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
So I'll try to kind of put that all into a compilation video and upload that to YouTube or something if you want to see.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I'll try to get that up later.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
Alright. Anyhow. So that was really it. That was Tigerclaw in our chat says top 40 music. Yuck.

20:56.000 --> 21:02.000
I actually, I might be misrepresenting a little bit. It's a lot of remixes of top 40 music.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
But Tigerclaw I know you like the electric and trance stuff and I think you would be happy with the stuff that they played.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
They played some cool stuff.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
So I know my friend constantly had her phone out with SoundHound or whatever that program is that lets you identify songs.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Like what's this electronic song? What's this song? So it's kind of a mix.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
Okay. Let's move on and actually get into the show itself.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
First some housekeeping. Please follow us on Twitter.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and also you can follow us on Facebook.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Next week is the 400th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
We'll be starting at 6 o'clock Pacific promptly 9 o'clock Eastern.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Bobby actually has the night off due to this.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
There's some football game that people care about here that a lot of people are apparently going to be watching.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
And we have the balls to go up against it.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
But if you must listen on the podcast feed then I suppose you can join us there too.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
But it'll be more fun I promise if you join us live next week for the 400th episode of O-L-R.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Alright let's get into tonight's gaming news.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
There was some big stuff. Big conferences. Things to talk about right, Loki?

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
Yes. The big thing of course is talking about the NGP.

22:07.000 --> 22:15.000
And the NGP is what I guess Sony is calling what everybody's pretty much dubbed the PSP2.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
And it is one sexy looking piece of equipment there.

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
Of course they had a lot of the stuff that was rumored to be in there.

22:27.000 --> 22:33.000
It's carrying a 5 inch OLED screen with pretty high resolution on it.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Four times the PSPs.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
A front touch screen.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
A rear touch pad.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
3G Wi-Fi.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Bluetooth.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
GPS.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Dual analog sticks.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And looks pretty awesome.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
So yeah I've got to get one.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
They didn't really give a price point.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
It is supposed to be out at least in one region before the end of the year.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
And I guess it looks like both the front and rear little touch pads are multi-touch.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
It does have a front and rear camera as well.

23:10.000 --> 23:17.000
Built in microphone. Of course it's also got 6 axis motion sensing.

23:17.000 --> 23:24.000
Including a 3 axis gyroscope, 3 axis accelerometer, and 3 axis electronic compass.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
Wait. You said something that I think I just totally missed during the press conference.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
You said built in microphone?

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Yes.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Is there a built in camera on this too?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Two. Front and back.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
Oh this thing is going to have video conferencing then no question.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
And that's something they didn't even really advertise.

23:40.000 --> 23:48.000
Interesting. There's no other reason to put a front camera on the damn thing than to have some type of competing FaceTime technology or whatever you want to call it.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Something like that yeah.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
And then Bluetooth and all sorts of other stuff.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
But I'm pretty excited about it.

23:58.000 --> 24:07.000
I mean a bunch of things I know they were mentioning of course it's going to be backwards compatible with PSP games like digital games so you can play PSP games on there.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
PlayStation 1 games.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Yeah but wait a minute what if I have the games on UMD am I just kind of screwed?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Yep.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
So it's compatible with PSP GO games?

24:17.000 --> 24:28.000
But you'll be able to play that stuff on there and I would imagine that it's going to be fully compatible with the PlayStation 1 stuff now because now you have the dual analog sticks.

24:28.000 --> 24:36.000
And they're saying that they're full analog sticks so I'm not sure if you can click down on them for the L3 and R3 stuff.

24:36.000 --> 24:47.000
But as far as like the L2 buttons that right there is your back little touch pad you know you can just the right half is the right button the right the left half is the left button.

24:47.000 --> 25:00.000
And then the shoulder buttons could be for everything else since I'd assume the multi touch stuff is probably going to be also pressure sensitive so that would be kind of sort of analog.

25:00.000 --> 25:08.000
But that's pretty awesome and it looks very similar to what you know the normal PSP 3000 looks like right now.

25:08.000 --> 25:28.000
They're going to also have I guess there's some some special slots for memory and games and stuff like that because obviously they're not using this type of rounds can be a proprietary format for both so it'll take just a little bit longer the crack I guess.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
And then of course they were talking about some of the games that are going to be out for it as well.

25:34.000 --> 25:44.000
Some of the games in the works Uncharted Killzone Resistance LittleBigPlanet and the game called Little Deviants which looks like the first kind of original game for the system.

25:44.000 --> 25:50.000
Obviously you know most of their I'd say all of their big franchise games are going to be coming out there.

25:50.000 --> 26:00.000
They did show Uncharted which is kind of interesting because Uncharted they had it where you could play it just like a normal PS3 game you know with the dual analog 6 and stuff like that.

26:00.000 --> 26:06.000
Or you could actually play it with kind of like the touch panel like you could tap stuff and you know go to different spots.

26:06.000 --> 26:15.000
So I guess trying to appeal to you know both hardcore gamer and casual you know phone gamer or whatever.

26:15.000 --> 26:26.000
Other things that they were talking about coming out Call of Duty a game called Broken Gravity Days Hot Shots Golf Hustle Kings which is the billiards game.

26:26.000 --> 26:33.000
Reality Fighters which is kind of an augmented reality fighting game which is kind of weird.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
Resistance Smart As which sounds like a trivia game and Wipe Out.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
That's not smart ass that's smart as.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Smart as.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Like smart as a 5th grader or something like that.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Gotcha.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
I suppose.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Interesting.

26:47.000 --> 26:54.000
Well they didn't name a price or a date but if you thought they were going to do that this early then you know you were kind of wishful thinking.

26:54.000 --> 27:02.000
Because you know E3 is really the time to do that and let's face it when Nintendo first unveiled the 3DS they didn't say any of that either.

27:02.000 --> 27:08.000
They just came out with the price and date what two months ago and now it's coming out in March.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
So or no last month and it's coming out in March.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Are we talking about price and date for the 3DS?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Yeah it just came out a couple weeks ago.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
Sorry I meant two months out of the actual release was when the dates came out.

27:20.000 --> 27:30.000
So to think that Sony was going to release the release date of this and the price and everything now 11 months before release or whatever was a little bit no.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I bet they don't even know what it's going to cost yet.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
They're probably trying to gauge the whole consumer reaction or also the price technology.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
I mean it goes down so rapidly so who knows.

27:39.000 --> 27:47.000
Price is kind of important obviously. I think it's too early to say if I really want to get one or not.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
I think it really depends on what's all there when it comes out.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
I'm definitely getting one just because I have store credit for the Sony store.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
So $280 of that's already spoken for.

27:58.000 --> 28:08.000
So as long as it's not like something stupid or ridiculous like $400 or even $400 might not be that bad with you know $280 taken out of the way.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
I'm actually thinking $400 might not be completely out of the realm of possibility.

28:13.000 --> 28:20.000
I don't think it's going to be $400 because it would be hard to justify a handheld system being more expensive than a console system.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
Well here's the thing. You got to look at its competition.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
I understand that.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I don't mean the 3DS.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I know what you're talking about.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
The iPad.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
And the iPad with 3G is what? $650 for the latest model?

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
Yeah but here's the thing.

28:38.000 --> 28:45.000
Unless Sony wants to take the what I consider douchebaggy route of well you're paying for the Sony product.

28:45.000 --> 28:51.000
The Sony name or level of you know wonderful that's in all of our products.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
I'm sorry.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
Apple may be able to get away with that because people have you know drank the Kool-Aid.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
I mean honestly if I didn't get that iPod for free I would not be buying an iPod.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
And I sure as hell am not buying an iPad.

29:07.000 --> 29:14.000
I'm sorry but you know that may be if they want to play that gamble then go ahead.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
But I think it's going to end up flopping on them just like you know the PSP Go.

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
Although this will be a little bit easier of an argument because it's you know a new system and stuff.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
But you know they're talking that there's probably going to be multiple SKUs on it.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
One for a 3G one for Wi-Fi.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
Personally I'd just pick up the Wi-Fi one because I don't want a fucking another data plan.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Exactly.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Tethered to my fucking phone that's what I'm going to do.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
I in dark he's gay in our chat room is dying for an educated guess from us gaming analysts.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Maha Maha Maha wants to know an educated guess for the price.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I'll give you my best guess.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
I'm going to say three hundred dollars without 3G and four hundred dollars with it.

29:52.000 --> 30:01.000
I think that's I think considering the level of technology they're trying to put in this thing and all these other little features and stuff.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
I think that's not outside the realm of possibility.

30:04.000 --> 30:11.000
However one big big wild card to keep in mind is Apple's next iPad.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
Which they're going to have a big announcement and they're going to release it within the next couple months.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
I mean that's you don't have to be an Apple psychic to know that.

30:20.000 --> 30:29.000
So if they manage to really cut the cost of those things that could make Sony have to kind of do a counter move.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
But seeing as I don't want to go too far out off base here.

30:33.000 --> 30:39.000
But I believe those new iPads will probably have the same retina display that the iPhone 4's are using right now.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
And it's going to make those things absolutely gorgeous.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
They'll probably still be charging at least six hundred dollars if you want an iPad with 3GS.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
So we'll see.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
So Sony can still at least be cheaper than an iPad if they do that.

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
And I kind of think that's going to be where their niche could be.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
Is that the Sony NGP could kind of be like cheaper than an iPad but does a lot of the same stuff.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
At least as far as games are concerned.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
So we'll see.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
Rama Narachan says, can someone tell me what NGP stands for?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Next generation portable.

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
It is a working name like Natal was. Do not expect that to be the final name.

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
I would be very surprised if they really, I actually don't really care for that as a name.

31:23.000 --> 31:30.000
Because, and somebody in the chat had said it earlier, by the time the NGP releases it's going to be the CGP.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
The current generation portable.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
So it would be a little silly for them to actually call it that.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Remember the Neptune.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
That's right, huh?

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
The Dolphin was the Nintendo GameCube at one point.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Or the Revolution was the Wii.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
So these code names, nothing new.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
I'm very curious to see what they're going to name it.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
I kind of don't think they would do PSP2.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
It doesn't roll off the tongue as nicely as PSP.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
You know what I mean?

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
I know that sounds really like nitpicky, but there's just something about, it's like all the extra syllables or something.

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
I know I'm being weird, but I just don't see PSP2 being it either.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
I don't know. We'll see.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
Let's talk a little more about what's going on with the new Sony system and it's this feature.

32:18.000 --> 32:26.000
And I kind of like this, because I like to see what the systems are doing besides just remakes of the same old games now on a portable.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
I like to know where are they going to be taking the games.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
So I was very interested with this. Something called Live Area.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
You might have seen some of the little promos, some of the arts.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
This very bubbly sort of interface.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
All these little bubbles. I don't know if they're taking a cue from Nintendo and making things a little bit cuter or whatever.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
But one of the things in this interface is Live Area.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
It's a game-oriented communication platform.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
It's the name for the user interface that's built into the system.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
That's what there will be instead of a cross-media bar.

32:56.000 --> 33:02.000
And you're going to be able to get into the store, get into trophies, your friends list, a browser, and all this other stuff in there.

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Every game is going to have Live Area presence as well.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
Meaning that news can be fed right into the game and even other players that you're playing against.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
Also, very interesting, there's going to be a Near Future.

33:15.000 --> 33:24.000
It will track your location over time, create a map of where you've been, and I guess find other people that are playing games near you, physically.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
So, could be interesting, could be scary.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
You know, when I was first hearing about this, I don't know why, but something popped into my mind.

33:30.000 --> 33:37.000
If they ever wanted to make Foursquare like an actual game, this might be the way to do it.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
You know what I mean?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Yeah, that could...

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
I don't know. I mean, I don't know what the game is there.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Sounds so handy for stalkers.

33:46.000 --> 33:52.000
Yeah, so the privacy things on this are going to have to be very, you know, whatever.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
It's kind of interesting, some of the cute things they do with GPS sometimes in games.

33:57.000 --> 34:07.000
For example, earlier I was talking about my trip to Disneyland and one of the things that you could do is that there's actually a Disney game for Toy Story Midway Mania that you can buy on the iPhone.

34:07.000 --> 34:17.000
Well, if you happen to be in front of the ride and you launch the game, you get like a bonus feature that will unlock like, I don't know what it is, like a new background or a new gun or a new stage.

34:17.000 --> 34:25.000
Something special that you can only get when the GPS knows you are at the damn ride at Disneyland or Disney World because they have it too.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
So, it will be interesting to see kind of what the GPS technology kind of brings to games.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Very curious.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And people, you know what?

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
That Pokémon thing with the walking trainer and all that was really popular.

34:37.000 --> 34:45.000
So, it's not outside the realm of possibility that people kind of like these ideas of being rewarded for going places.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
3DS is doing something similar too with the whole coins thing, built-in pedometer.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
So, it will be interesting.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Well, news for our UK listeners.

34:57.000 --> 35:07.000
The 3DS eShop is actually not going to, well, is not going to go live like they said it would with launch.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
They actually said that it's going to go live in May.

35:10.000 --> 35:19.000
Now, Nintendo UK said that it was going to be there with the launch, but Iwata basically said, nope, nope, nope.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
The first system update is scheduled for late May, the same time around the world.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
So, it's not just them. It's everybody.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
I wish I'm glad Iwata came out and actually said something himself.

35:32.000 --> 35:37.000
But, you know, they need to make sure that all of their reps are on the same page.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Don't you think?

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
Yeah, it kind of makes it sound like they don't even know when the damn thing is launching.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Kind of like, it'll be done when it's done.

35:45.000 --> 35:52.000
It's going to be out in Europe on March 25th, but we won't have the eShop until the first system update.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
It's just going to be in May.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
Does it seem now that maybe they're rushing the 3DS a little bit?

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
Like, maybe they should have just waited to release it until summertime.

36:02.000 --> 36:08.000
I mean, maybe there's something about May, like why you have to release it in that type of timeframe or something like that.

36:08.000 --> 36:16.000
But, I'm sorry, March? I don't know why they couldn't have delayed this a little bit if it's not really ready.

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
I mean, they're going to sell most of these at Christmas time anyway, right?

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
That would be reasonable to me.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I don't know.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
And I also say that because of the launch games.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
You know, it kind of doesn't have the must-have title that's going to be out at launch.

36:35.000 --> 36:40.000
I mean, probably the coolest stuff that's coming out of launch is what? The Street Fighter game?

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
The Dead or Alive game, maybe?

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
And maybe Nintendogs and Cats, if that's what you're into.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
You know, but that's kind of a stretch for like a must-have launch title.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
You know, that Kid Icarus game didn't make it.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
You know, we haven't heard of the Zelda remake or any of that.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
You know, none of that kind of made the launch.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
So, I don't know.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
What do you guys in our chat room think? chat.orangesoundsready.com

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
Well, I was going to say actually it does seem like that they're like,

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
Well, either we wait and put everything out together or we at least get the system out,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
get some early sales going on.

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
And then once everyone sees what else is on the eShop, then we get another boost in sales come May.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
That's sort of what I'm seeing of.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Go to our chat room at chat.orangesoundsready.com.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
We're reading some comments from some of these other things we've been talking about.

37:29.000 --> 37:35.000
Yizam says, The Pokewalker was awesome. Walk up to your fellow trainer and ask if they'd like to touch balls.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
I saw a lot of that happening at PAX East last year when I went.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Spassinator says, I'm a bit paranoid about taking portable stuff out and about,

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
if only because I live in a rough neighborhood and I don't want to be jumped and robbed.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
It's actually not a bad point.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
Not everybody's going to want to find the players near them. You know what I mean?

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
That could be a little scary.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
And I apologize if I'm pronouncing this name incorrectly.

37:57.000 --> 38:05.000
Niparos says, It does seem Netflix has Ren and Stimpy.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
Since we were wondering that earlier. Thanks for checking. Appreciate that.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Good to know.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
Well, you know, the other thing too is that something like that actually might work in Japan.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
Because you remember with all the stuff that was happening with Monster Hunter.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
You know, that was such a big thing and people would just randomly challenge it.

38:22.000 --> 38:28.000
It was a Nintendogs thing. That's something that I think would happen more often in Japan.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
But not so much here.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
Years ago, the barcode scanner.

38:34.000 --> 38:42.000
You just got people that are more into it who will go to the cons and just walk through the street.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Oh god, I forgot about that game.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
There was some type of battle game that was battle barcodes or something.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
I remember that.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
And they sold out of this one brand of ramen or something.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Because it created some uber monster.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
And then there was the CD one.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
What was the game that you put in your CD and you get a different monster based on the CD?

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
And you got this great monster by using Madonna?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Totally don't know.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
But now it would be too easy to just burn your own CD.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
Because obviously it was measuring track length and number of tracks or something. Interesting.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
Alright, let's go to the next story then.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
We'll chew on this 3DS news a little bit.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
See what happens closer to launch.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
And now back to more Sony news.

39:29.000 --> 39:36.000
We talked about last week how the people figured out ways to load custom firmwares and stuff like that on their PS3.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
So what's the first thing that happens when they do that?

39:40.000 --> 39:46.000
Of course, release new PS3 firmware update or this could even go for the PSP.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
And patch all that stuff out.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Or at least try to break it.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
So that's what they did.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
They released 3.56 firmware.

39:55.000 --> 40:00.000
It adds no functionality whatsoever other than a security patch.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
And it basically changed some of the keys on different things.

40:06.000 --> 40:15.000
Kind of set everyone back a little bit in the hacking community because they don't have a way to modify the firmware yet.

40:15.000 --> 40:23.000
Another thing it did is it banned people from playing black ops that were cheating.

40:23.000 --> 40:32.000
Or were using modified game saves and other methods to cheat the game.

40:32.000 --> 40:39.000
And they've permanently banned those people from playing black ops in multiplayer.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
Yay! Cheaters get smacked down.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
You just think about that future cheaters.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
It's one thing if you want to cheat amongst people you know.

40:49.000 --> 40:54.000
I don't care if you cheat in single player where you're not going online or any of that.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Or if you cheat with friends.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
But going just to be power tripping in random online matches is a dick thing to do.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
Dicks deserve to have dick things happen to them in return.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
And you remember how they were saying,

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
Oh well there's no way for us to possibly stop these guys from cheating on our games.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
There's no way. Oh poor us Activision.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Yeah I do remember that. That was funny.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Weren't they trying to use that as an excuse or something?

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
Well now that excuse is out of the way and hopefully they're going to fix everything.

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
I do believe there was a patch for the PS3 version as well to fix some stuff.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
But now it's not an excuse.

41:33.000 --> 41:40.000
Alright. Let me move on to what's coming in a future PS3 update if the rumors are to be believed.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
And I would believe this actually.

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
Apparently there are some folks in the development community that are getting notices from Sony saying that in firmware 3.60

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
cloud storage for saved games will be available.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
It's called online saving. They're not calling it cloud saving.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
Maybe make everybody think of Final Fantasy 7. I don't know.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
But they're calling it online saving.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
This means that you could actually save files on a remote server.

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
So that way if I'm playing a game at home I could save to the online save and then access this at my friend's house.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
That would be kind of cool.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
There you go.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
By the way this feature will only be available of course to PlayStation Plus subscribers.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Ha ha ha.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
So there you go.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
And this doesn't surprise me at all.

42:23.000 --> 42:28.000
I seem to remember when they first announced the PlayStation Plus that this was one of the features they were touting.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
So it's not too surprising that this is finally coming out.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Kind of a neat idea.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
You know I kind of like that idea.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
And if you go to your friend's houses and sometimes forget your save files.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
Or hauling the memory cards around is too big of a bitch or whatever.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
You know or you forget then it's a neat idea.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
I kind of wish Microsoft had one too that didn't involve save cards.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
So I think it's neat.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I don't know is this a feature you'd use?

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
I don't think anyone in here uses PlayStation Plus right now.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Is this something that might make you want to get it?

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Nope.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
No? Why not?

43:01.000 --> 43:08.000
Because I don't ever take my game saves anywhere other than you know on my PS3.

43:08.000 --> 43:14.000
And if I really was you know aching to do that I could just throw it on a jump drive.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
Dark Sakura? Anything that would interest you?

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
It's a neat idea.

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
It's a fun concept but I don't I'd have to see it more in practice before I make a judgment on it.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Honestly.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
This would have been perfect in like the college dorm where everybody had a video game system.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
And you're going from like room to room.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
That would have been great.

43:33.000 --> 43:38.000
You know it would have been something like that would have been cool back in the the DVR edit days.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
You know.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Let's see.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
Tigerclaw says so Sky is saying I don't care if you're autistic you're still a cheater.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Oh boy.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
He's invoking a story which didn't make our show world tonight.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Maybe you've heard of it.

43:52.000 --> 43:59.000
But Microsoft banned this kid and the mom was all over the media saying he's autistic and he's just really good at games.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
And Microsoft's like no we caught him cheating.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
He's banned from the network just like anybody else would be.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
And turns out it came to light.

44:07.000 --> 44:13.000
Yes he was doing that whole save file exploit thing where he could unlock achievements from opening up a save file.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
And so yeah.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
I don't care if you're autistic.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
If you cheat you're a cheater and you should be dealt with appropriately.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
I agree.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
That has nothing to do with the end result.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Totally agree.

44:25.000 --> 44:31.000
It doesn't matter the color of your skin, the sexuality, any type of handicap you might have.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Physical, mental.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Cheating is cheating.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Period.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
You know what I mean.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
It's just a little silly.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
I like how, and this is all I'm going to say on it.

44:44.000 --> 44:57.000
I like how when you know someone with a disability or you know some persecuted group will just come right out and say oh well you're doing it because of this this and this.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
No you wanted to be treated like everybody else right?

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
How far do I want to go with this? How controversial do I want to be on the show?

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
There's a difference between actually singling somebody out and then treating somebody like everybody else.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
Alright. Do you guys remember there was that burger joint in Town Town that was very popular.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
It was all over the Food Network shows.

45:17.000 --> 45:27.000
And they ended up getting sued by the American Disability Association or whatever because apparently the place was called the Squeeze In.

45:27.000 --> 45:33.000
And it kind of made its whole little reputation off of being packed and crowded all of the time.

45:33.000 --> 45:38.000
And some folks sued them based on disability needs and the damn place almost closed.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
That's ridiculous.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
And I kind of, I agree. And here's the thing.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Well technically it did close.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
It did close and it had to reopen in a new location.

45:46.000 --> 45:54.000
But they, and this is important to say, all you had to do was to honk your horn outside the restaurant and they would have served you whatever.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
I mean they, you did not have to actually go into the restaurant.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
So I don't think anyone was like totally being discriminated against or what have you.

46:00.000 --> 46:06.000
You know? It just kind of struck me as, you know, ruining it for everyone. I don't know.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
No, I agree.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
It was a mess. But at the same time, that place never got more publicity than when that whole thing happened.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
You know what I mean?

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
So, I don't care.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
Alright. Let's see. Moving on to the chat room.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
Spaznator in our chat room says, disability is no excuse to cheat.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
I'm disabled myself and I refuse to cheat.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.000
If I can do it just as good, if not better, at a game, I wear that fact as a badge of friggin' honor.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
I agree. It's a good one.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
I gotta read this comment from Derek H. Maybe lighten the mood a little bit too.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
At our chatroom at chat.orangemantraded.com, Derek H says, confirmed.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
Rob says, it's okay to cheat with friends.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
I think a lot of bored housewives share the same philosophy.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
So are you saying that the mailman is a friend?

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I'm not sure quite what you're saying there.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Alright.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Well if you're fucking him, he is.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I think you know what I meant.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
It's okay if you're a bored housewife cheating in...

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
What would bored housewives play? Final Fantasy XI?

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
Bunko.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
Bunko. If you're all cheating in Bunko, you have...

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
Do they even have Bunko on Xbox Live Arcade or anything like that?

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
No.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
That's a whole niche market they're missing out on.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
If you have house rules for Bunko, then that's fine.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
You know what I would actually compare it to?

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
And this is totally not what Derek meant by his comment, but too late.

47:25.000 --> 47:31.000
You know in Monopoly, a lot of people say that every time you pay fines,

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
you're supposed to put it in the center of the board,

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
and if you land on free parking, you get the jackpot?

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
That's a house rule.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
That's a house rule. That's not a rule. That's cheating.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
You're cheating.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
But you agree to house rules because it's kind of how you play with friends, right?

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
So, anyhow.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Let's move on.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
More stories, Loki.

47:52.000 --> 47:59.000
Okay, so this is kind of more about the whole firmware updates and whatnot.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
It ties in to all that.

48:01.000 --> 48:08.000
Sony, of course, was granted a temporary restraining order against GeoHot.

48:08.000 --> 48:16.000
Basically preventing him from offering to the public, creating, posting online,

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
marketing, advertising, promoting, installing, distributing, providing,

48:19.000 --> 48:26.000
or otherwise trafficking in any software or methods for circumventing PS3 protection methods.

48:26.000 --> 48:32.000
No longer can he provide links from any websites to any other websites relating to such matters

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
or publish any information obtained by hacking the PS3,

48:36.000 --> 48:42.000
and more to the point, he can no longer engage in acts of circumvention of the TPMS

48:42.000 --> 48:49.000
in the PS3 system to access, obtain, remove, or traffic in copyrighted works.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
Which I don't think he was doing anyways.

48:52.000 --> 49:00.000
And then, of course, there's still issues about the whole jurisdiction issues

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
since, of course, he resides in a different state than Sony

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
and a different state from where the claim was filed.

49:06.000 --> 49:13.000
And they're saying that because he purposefully directed his activities at the forum state of California,

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
they're letting it go through.

49:15.000 --> 49:20.000
So that's kind of, that's not a good precedent to be setting by the courts,

49:20.000 --> 49:27.000
saying, oh, well, because you conducted yourself on a website that was located in California,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
we can try you in California.

49:29.000 --> 49:36.000
So, you know, anybody who uses Facebook or Twitter or whatever can be tried in California,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
no matter where you are in the world, I guess.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
I find this comment from our chatroom interesting.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I have to ask Loki about it here.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
It's from Napreos.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
I finally figured out how to pronounce the name.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Napreos says, F-G-O-HOT.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
He deserves it, cocky bastard.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
Now, I haven't really seen this guy in action.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
I realize he's been in the media and so forth, but is that, like, a legitimate claim?

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Is he really cocky?

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Like, did he kind of have it coming to him?

49:57.000 --> 50:04.000
I don't know if he's cocky, but it all comes down to, I mean, this is just part of the discovery phase of the whole trial.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
It's not like Sony is getting his equipment.

50:08.000 --> 50:15.000
I mean, they'll have access to it along with the lawyers, you know, to kind of make sure no funny business is going on,

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
but it's not like this stuff gets shipped to Sony.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
And even still, it doesn't even really matter.

50:23.000 --> 50:31.000
Like I said, this whole trial isn't necessarily about, you know, what GeoHot's doing, because there's plenty of other people.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
I mean, all he did was post the keys.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
He didn't create the custom firmwares that are out there.

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
He didn't, you know, create the abilities to play backup games.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
That was other people.

50:42.000 --> 50:50.000
And they've actually gone and they've been doing cease and desists on different websites, hosting files and whatnot,

50:50.000 --> 50:57.000
but now people have kind of diverted that stuff to a file hosting place off-sea, you know, in other countries.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
So they can't be touched, I guess.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Let me play devil's advocate here for a minute.

51:01.000 --> 51:12.000
Not that I necessarily feel this way, but wouldn't that sort of be the equivalent of you shut down a file sharing site such as Pirate Bay or whatever,

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
because they're enabling people to facilitate illegal downloads.

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
They're not posting the illegal downloads themselves, but because they facilitate it, they're the ones that get in trouble.

51:22.000 --> 51:30.000
I would say that would make sense if you're basically... if he was releasing the backup creator for it.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
Yes, this could be used for legitimate backups, but some people might not use it for that.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
That's not what he's doing at all.

51:36.000 --> 51:49.000
This is basically saying, I guess it would be the equivalent of a car salesman handing you the keys to a car and you go hit someone with that car.

51:49.000 --> 51:54.000
They're enabling you to get in that car and murder someone with that car, so they should be held liable for it.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
That's basically what the equivalent of it is.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
Dealerships actually do have liability against that type of thing.

52:00.000 --> 52:07.000
But it's retarded. I understand that they may get away with that in the laws in the United States because it's absolutely retarded,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
but people can sue and win for hot coffee.

52:10.000 --> 52:23.000
Granted, he posted stuff, keys, and I'm sure that they don't want people obviously giving them backdoor access to the entire PS3,

52:23.000 --> 52:32.000
but what he's done, yes, may eventually lead to piracy or easier piracy on PlayStation 3,

52:32.000 --> 52:41.000
because these tools allow people to run unsigned code and people can create unsigned programs for piracy purposes,

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
but also they can create code for other things.

52:44.000 --> 52:53.000
So it's not necessarily that he's directly responsible for it, but yes, he plays a part of that, I guess.

52:53.000 --> 52:59.000
But once again, this court case isn't about necessarily him hacking stuff.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
It's about whether you own that console that you purchased.

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
I was going to say, and this is a great comment from Bob Coffey in our chat room here,

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
Hackers aren't cheaters. The trial isn't about hacking. The trial is about your rights as a consumer,

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
not about CFW or any shit at that. The real precedent this may set is,

53:15.000 --> 53:21.000
do you own the computing product you buy, or is it a licensed product?

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
Interesting note to end it on. I guess we'll see what develops with this.

53:24.000 --> 53:30.000
Any rumors about, or any rumbling about any pushback, appeals, things of that nature? What happens next?

53:30.000 --> 53:34.000
Well, they've already filed an appeal to have the whole case, you know, dismissed,

53:34.000 --> 53:39.000
but I don't think, it doesn't sound like that the judge is going for that.

53:39.000 --> 53:46.000
So at this point, I don't know, it's going to be tough to prove that he did all this stuff, or he's actually doing it.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
The problem is that somebody's claiming all these things that obviously aren't true.

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
Like they're saying, oh yes, he's pirating stuff, or he's enabled it for people to pirate stuff.

53:54.000 --> 53:59.000
When they initially made that statement, that was not the case.

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
Now it may be the case, because now there's the ability to do that, but it wasn't anything he did.

54:05.000 --> 54:17.000
So, I don't know, it's difficult to, it all depends on how intelligent the court, the judges and stuff like that,

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
and whether she's going to buy into this retarded nonsense.

54:22.000 --> 54:26.000
Alright, well we will see what develops. I'm sure we have not said the last on this,

54:26.000 --> 54:33.000
so let's go ahead and move on to some release dates, and travel the world and see what is coming out in a video game store near you this week.

54:33.000 --> 54:41.000
Not a whole lot this week actually, it's pretty sad, but there will be some better stuff in the upcoming month.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
This week, they've got a track pack for Rock Band.

54:45.000 --> 54:55.000
If you're missing out on some country music, there's a second country track pack coming out this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

54:55.000 --> 55:06.000
Let's see, some other smaller games, Junior Brain Trainer 2 is making its way out on DS.

55:06.000 --> 55:14.000
The Sims 3 Outdoor Living, it's kind of an expansion pack for The Sims 3, that's coming out on PC.

55:14.000 --> 55:20.000
That's funny. On PC they have a game called The Ball.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
Apparently someone took my advice and made a game about ball.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
Wow!

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
That is coming out on PC.

55:31.000 --> 55:40.000
And then of course, a week from today, sort of, Mario Sports Mix will be out on the Wii.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
That's it?

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
Yeah.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
Wow.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
It's a really, really dead week.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
Is there a reason for that? Is that just because of the 3DS?

55:49.000 --> 55:54.000
Not yet into the middle of February. February is a pretty light month.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
I mean, it's more games than there would be in January, but it's not March.

55:58.000 --> 56:03.000
Alright. Well, let's move on and look at Japan and what they've got coming out.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
I gotta tell you, it's kind of the same thing. They don't have a whole lot coming out.

56:06.000 --> 56:11.000
There's a couple things to note. Dodonpachi Daifukutsu Black Label comes out.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
That's a cave shooter coming out on the Xbox 360.

56:14.000 --> 56:25.000
That is coming out on February the 3rd because they get a lot of those shooters over there where it's just pretty much that little center of the screen getting taken up with a shooter.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
But quite an audience for the shmups over here too.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
So you can check that out.

56:30.000 --> 56:36.000
Also, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 gets its localized edition on the Xbox 360 this week.

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
That is also coming out on the PlayStation 3 and that's the only PS3 release this week in Japan.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
Going to the Nintendo Wii real quick.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Nothing.

56:45.000 --> 56:52.000
Things are dying down on the Nintendo front, of course, because of the 3DS's impending release on February 26th over there.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
Although the Nintendo DS does have a couple things to note.

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
Dragon Ball Ultimate Butou 2 Den comes out this week from Namco Bandai.

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
Also, Gyakuten Kenji 2 comes out this week.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
That is in a regular and a limited edition. It's coming out from Capcom.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
I believe that is a Phoenix Wright spinoff game.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
That comes out this week.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
It definitely has some of the same characters in that series.

57:18.000 --> 57:28.000
I think this looks to be a little more like walking around adventure-y type of game, but I'm sure still the whole courtroom scenes and objections that you know and love.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Moving on quickly to the PSP.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
There's a release on there that some folks might be interested in.

57:33.000 --> 57:37.000
White Knight Chronicles Episode Portable Dogma Wars comes out this week.

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
That's an official Sony product from Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan this week.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
It'll be interesting to see what they improved on in the PS3 version, if anything.

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
Also on the PSP, Macross Triangle Frontier.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
And that does it for your Japanese releases.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Wait, that's the Macross Frontier game?

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Yeah, Macross Triangle Frontier.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Let me see, because Macross Frontier is the...

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Yeah, that's for the new one that came out.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
The new series it was out.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.000
Which Dan and I watched all the way through. It's really good.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
So this looks really cool.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Looks kind of like a 3D shooter game.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
Not like a typical shmup. More of like a polygon-y shmup game.

58:13.000 --> 58:21.000
We're big fans of the Macross games. I bet it's a lot like the VFR games.

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
Actually, we've got Macross M3 for Dreamcast, which is a really good game.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
So yeah, I love the Macross games.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Was that Japan?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
That's it for Japan.

58:33.000 --> 58:43.000
In the UK, February 2nd, we have Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
We have long cookies.

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
On the 4th, we have Earthrise, Lord of Arcana.

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
Mario vs. Donkey Kong Mini Land Mayhem. Nailed.

58:53.000 --> 58:59.000
Sega Mega Drive Classics Volume 4 and Two Worlds 2.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
That's it.

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
Let's move on with some more stories.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
And the Classic Game of the Week is just ahead.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I don't know what's more ridiculous.

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
The whole lawsuit that this company is facing or the name of this game.

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
But Facebook game Blingville is getting the cease and desist from Zynga.

59:19.000 --> 59:25.000
Apparently Zynga believes that they own the rights to the use of Ville in any product.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
I guess it's out there.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
Gosh, what are you, the new monster cables? Seriously.

59:31.000 --> 59:36.000
I'm going to start suing everybody for using Ville or Doodle or Monster.

59:36.000 --> 59:41.000
But apparently, they have a...

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
Send a cease and desist to Blingville LLC.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
A unique company name, I suppose.

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
The creators of the Facebook game, of course, has the same name.

59:52.000 --> 01:00:01.000
According to Zynga, the use of Ville in the game and the company's moniker infringes on its own collection of social gaming trademarks.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Blingville, of course, associated with Zynga in any way, has filed a letter to the West Virginia US District Court seeking a declaration from the court that the game does not actually infringe on Zynga's trademarks.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000
The studio also hopes to have Zynga foot the bill for any legal fees potentially accrued during the legal battle.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And I guess right now, it's just a matter of time to see what happens.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I love Breslull's comment in our chat room. Cruella de Vil? Will they be suing Disney?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I think that's possible.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Come on, Zynga.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I kind of find it to be a taste of their own medicine a little bit. Wasn't Farmville like a rip-off of Farm Town? Which of those two came first?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
It was Farm Town.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Ah, so, I mean, come on, Zynga.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Whatever. Zynga's, like, evil, okay? And that's all it comes down to.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000
People hate Zynga. Like, they don't have any original content. It's just ripped off from stuff.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And now they're suing people out of the way because they may come in and start taking away some of the money that Farmville or Cityville or, I don't know, whatever.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Just because you have names of stuff that end with a Ville does not mean all of a sudden you own the trademark to Ville.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
They're gonna sue Danville next.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I think the people that made Farm Town should sue them because they started farm games, honestly.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
If that lawsuit didn't already happen.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Yeah, I'm looking at Wikipedia. I mean, I know it's not a definitive resource, but it's a pretty good place to start researching.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And I do notice it says Farmville started as a clone of the popular Farm Town, which also featured on Facebook in June 2009.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And there are some citations for that.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
What's the other big Zynga game? Isn't Yeoville another big one? Do they even have that?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I don't know. Let me see. I thought that's what it was called. I don't see an article on that.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
What are the other big Zynga games out there? I wanna know if they were not those two.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Texas Hold'em.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Really?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Dan plays that.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Ugh. Um. Let's see. I'm trying to see if they have like a list of games somewhere here. Oh, here we go.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Mafia Wars. Wasn't that a knockoff of a game, too?

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I know this is a very exciting radio. Yeah.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:24.000
The makers of a similar online game, Mob Wars, sued Zynga over the launch of Mafia Wars, accusing them of copyright infringement.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Frontierville. That's the other big one, too.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
That's the one I always see on my stupid wall. I don't think that was necessarily a ripoff of anything, though.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Interesting.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Alright.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I just think all of thoseville games are a waste of time.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
You know, I would sit here and criticize it, but then, again, I can't stop playing that stupid Knights of the Clicky.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Or, what is it really called? Knights of the Crystal is the real name of the game.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
That Square Enix one. Can't stop playing it. It's the dumbest game ever, but I just keep clickin'.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Click, click, click. Keep doing quests. The artwork's really good, at least. I can say that. Get away with that.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Alright, here's a more respectable game I'm getting excited about. Portal 2. Of course, Portal 2 is coming out soon.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I guess that's really a relative term, but it's coming out within the next few months.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Portal 2 is going to be coming out, of course, on the PC and the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
But we had some news, of course, last week about how PlayStation 3 is supposed to be the definitive version.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Well, there's going to be a lot of cool stuff on the PC version as well, including mod tools.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
You know, what is a Valve game that doesn't have some mod tools available for it?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And some mod tools will be available on the PC version of Portal 2.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Unfortunately, that content is not going to be available on the 360 or the PS3, meaning the mod tools.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.000
However, what they're saying, and this is a quote from Chet Felizic, who is from Valve, saying,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000
The content that comes out is agnostic, and so we will be seeing that on all platforms.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Depending on the platform you're on, I should say, will depend on how we're delivering it.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Meaning that, you know, the content that you make, it could come out on the PS3 or it could come out on the 360.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Perhaps it's some type of download content, maybe a best of on the PC.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.000
But if you are really into the user content, then maybe you ought to think about that when you decide which system you're going to purchase the game on.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:23.000
By the way, they are also saying that each of the game's two campaign modes will have individual surprise rewards when you beat them.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
So single player has one reward, co-op has another.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
There are two sets of credits and two sets of endings. Interesting.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
So if you really want to get the full game, you're going to have to play single and you're going to have to play co-op.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
That should be very interesting.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:47.000
So there you go, Portal 2 coming out whenever Valve's ready. I know there's a release date out there somewhere, but I refuse to believe anything final until the game is actually out on shelves.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000
If you need something to play in the meantime, how about the classic game of the week?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:59.000
It's a chance for DarkSakura to dive into the gaming vault and pick a game that she thinks, hey, you kids ought to be playing this.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
This is a true classic game.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000
And instead of all this newfangled Farmville crap, and I mean crap...

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Get off my lawn.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Go play this game instead and get off my lawn.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Alright, what is the classic game of the week?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Pull up your pants.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
What is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I think that the chat room will be able to tell the moment the music plays.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Well then, let me pull up the little music here and...

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And whoever guesses first in the chat room, I'm looking, gets a no prize.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Alright, I'm looking at you, chat room.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
They're on to like a minute delay, so you might want to see it for a little bit.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Okay. Well, it is Final Fantasy VI, or as we got it over here, Final Fantasy III.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And it is one of my all-time favorite games because of this music.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
This music is epic. It makes me want to climb a mountain.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
It had a great, great, great story.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:06.000
It had really amazing classic scenes, like the Opera House, which of course everyone knows.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:14.000
This whole music plays when they're in their little machine walker things.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And Bojikawa gets the no prize, by the way.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
It was just amazing.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:30.000
This game came out in 1994 in Japan, and then it came out in 1999 on the PlayStation.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
It was amazing, like I've said a bunch of times.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It's actually sort of based about the second industrial revolution,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
meaning that it's got the sort of technical aspects into the game.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Character designs were done by Yoshitaka Amano,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:57.000
and he did pretty much everything with that game as far as the character designs and whatnot.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Well, actually also he and Yoshinori Kitase,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:11.000
and then of course the composer for the music was Nobuo Uematsu, so it was really good.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It had random encounters, and you had chocobos in your airship,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
and it was just everything that one expects to be in a Final Fantasy game.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
You had an active time battle system, you had four players per party,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000
and you could also change your main person walking around, I think by hitting one of the shoulder buttons.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:35.000
You had your thief, you had the runic ability, which was absorbing magic attacks until the next turn.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
That was Selle's.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
All kinds of different stuff.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Then you had your special hidden characters like Gao, who was the monster mimic.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And you had a Moogle, who...

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Why can't I remember the Moogle's name?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Anyway, Mog, yes, thank you, it was Mog.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Because Mog house.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But anyway, he had dances, which was always really fun.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Dude, it was all about Realm, who had the drawing attack.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
That was really sick.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
So yeah, it had all kinds of neat stuff.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
It's very steampunky in ways too, combining technology and magic.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And it had the most insane bad guy ever, Kefka, who just had this funny, funny laugh.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And...

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I know, right?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Oh, and don't forget, the man.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
If you can find the music rub, you should play it. Shadow.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
If I can find it.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Because he was freaking amazing.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:52.000
But yeah, it actually had alterations made in some of the character sprites.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:01.000
For example, there was this one character who you could see her naked butt, and they covered her butt up.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:08.000
You know, some of the item names were changed here and there, especially for the PlayStation release.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Yo, you found it.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
This is also the good music of the game.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Turn it up a little bit wrong.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
What did you say?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Dan said he would slit his mama's throat for...

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I know, but I forgot the line.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Wasn't Shadow, like, wasn't the whole thing that Shadow's a chick?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
No.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I thought, isn't Shadow supposed to be, like, Realm's mom or something?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Realm's father. Oh, okay.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Hinted app, but never confirmed.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Dan's talking off mic.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
That'll be confirmed in Final Fantasy VI, too.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
When Square gets around to making that.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:59.000
But, I mean, and keep in mind, you know, they used the characters from this for doing the Nintendo 64 demo, remember?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
When they were gonna put Final Fantasy VII on the Nintendo 64.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Which the demo is kinda weird looking, but it was neat at the same time.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
But this was seriously...

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I think it has to be one of the highlights of the series.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Definitely one of the highlights of the series.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:21.000
And there's also discussion about it being remade for the 3DS. I think that's pretty cool.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
That'd be neat.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Yeah.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
But, yeah. There we go.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
There it is, folks. Your classic game of the week, Final Fantasy VI.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Or as you might call it, it's so good it's Final Fantasy sex.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I don't know. It's up to you.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Alright, that's gonna do it for Part A tonight of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
But don't go anywhere, guys. We're not done with the show yet.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Part B is coming up. We have more news for you guys.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
We're gonna talk about an interesting funding program for independent video games.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
We'll get into that.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Some clarity on the next wave of 3DS games, including Kid Icarus and some other things.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Some developments in that whole Sarian.net thing.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Remember how you could play like King's Quest on your iPad?

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
We have some updates on that.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
We're gonna get into all that in Part B as well as your Twitter topics.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
So get them in at OLR on Twitter.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Your emails and much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:25.000
We are live on this Sunday, January the 30th of 2011 for the 399th episode of our show.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
That's right. We hit a little bit of a milestone next week.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
And then I get to start saying four a lot.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
No plans of ending anytime soon.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000
We'll still be here until, I don't know, one of us is hospitalized for a long time or something.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I shouldn't say something like that. God, I hope nothing like that ever happens.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Anyhow, meanwhile, we also have side projects.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Like this thing's been going on so long that now everybody wants to do their side project.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Not everyone.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Not everyone. Well, Loki, your baby is your side project. That's kind of...

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
18 years worth of side projects.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Even if it wasn't.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:03.000
That's right. Josh, the... I don't know. I would love to hear Nellie do a podcast about video games because she kind of hates them all.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Well, she's like, I have to always stay here and watch the baby.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I was like, well, you can go do the show. I'll stay here and watch the baby.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I was like, okay.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
That would be fun. I think on April Fool's Day, you should send Nellie over.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
We'll make her read stories and everything.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
She'll be like, I don't even know what this says. This is just words.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
What is this? You guys, what is this?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
You guys care about this stuff?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
She's welcome to bring Josh over.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
That's right, yeah.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
And then I'll watch the baby and she can read my stories.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
He's sick right now. He can't come over.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
All right. Anyhow.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Other things to talk about that's going on. Spinoff shows, sideshows.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Dark Sakura does a comic book one every week. Tell us about it.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
It's called Comic Insanity.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:47.000
And we basically just talk about, you know, what's coming out this week, every Wednesday.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
And the show goes up on Tuesday, ideally.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And, you know, we talk about what we're reading, what we're looking forward to.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
We all have a pick that all three of us are going to read.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
And then we also review different things that we've read.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Like, for example, we all just read, excuse me, IDW's Infestation.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I think it was Infestation. Yeah.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Which, you know, we all gave our reviews on it. I hated it.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And, you know, talked about other comics that we read.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Next week, if you want to hear our review on a comic called Witchfinder,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
then we will be reviewing that one next week.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000
We also have an app for Android, so you can listen to episodes and tweet us.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
We have our iPhone app coming soon.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Want to know our app for Android? What the hey?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I'm working on this.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
All right. I want to know more about this.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
But I just found out about it.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Okay. That's fine.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
So, yeah. And you can find us on Infamous.net and F-A-M-O-U-S.net.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Awesome.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Hoard House. The best little Hoard House in Azeroth if you want more Warcraft talk.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And how could you possibly want more after this show?

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
No, there's a whole show I have with my pal Xtaphir that we talk about Warcraft.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Didn't have a show this week, so I can't tell you what was going on.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Xtaphir had an emergency he had to deal with, so we didn't have a show this week.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000
But we are going to be back next week talking about, you know,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
what's going on in the world of Warcraft.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And there's a new patch on the horizon that's likely to drop this week,

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
so I'm sure there's going to be a lot of talk about some of the changes they make this week.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
They already put up a patch, didn't they?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Well, they patch that game all the time.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Oh, no, because I upgraded to Cataclysm and that's when mine patched.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Got it. Yeah, that's the patch you're thinking of.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
But there is a new, it's the post-Cataclysm patch that fixes some of the problems.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
That fixed the arcane?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'd go that far.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
But we'll be talking about some of that next week on the show.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Also, Bresloul would slap me in the face if I did not mention what's going on with

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
U.S.L. Madness.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Understation Live's little tournament that they do where they try to find the best

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
video game of all time, time, time, time, time.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Vote now. All the links are in our forums at

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
orangesloudestrader.com. Check the U.S.L. Madness forum.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Which we know what's going to win, and I know it's not on any of the lists,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
but it's going to be a write-in winner.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
You watch Barbie Horse Adventures.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
It's going to be a dark horse.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I'm not, literally, I'm not sure that there's a write-in thing you can do after

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
the beginning, but if there's a way to hack it, Loki will.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Loki will hack the results of U.S.L. Madness. Just watch.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
They'll all be Barbie Horse Adventure.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
It'll all be Barbie Horse Adventure.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And then I have to say this. Bobby, the gentleman who does the show before us,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
the Bobby Black Wolf show, it's fantastic.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Live at All Games Radio. Look it up on iTunes. Subscribe.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
He mentioned on his show tonight, he was reviewing the game Two Worlds 2,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
and he talked for a long time about this game.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I haven't even touched the game yet.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
The first one was so bad, from what I heard, that I had no interest in the

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
second one, but apparently the second one fixes a lot of problems.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
There's a lot of funny references in it, and one of the screenshots she sent us

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
is a character saying, or you can choose between an option, saying,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I'll do it, and, well, I'm pleased to inform you that you can now ask

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Mr. Mirage to die in a fire. That's right.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
The die in a fire reference has made it into a video game.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
There you go.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
If you said die in a boat fire, then we know that they were listening to OLR,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
because I don't think you hear that expression anywhere else.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
But if you have never heard die in a boat fire before, Dark Soccer's eating,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
so I'll have to explain it to you.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Oh, Dark Soccer's gonna chew, chew, chew.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Okay.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Okay, die in a boat fire.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Sorry, I'm eating unagi.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Why would you tell someone to die in a boat fire?

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Because you'd either drown to death because you couldn't get back in the boat

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000
because it was on fire, or you would burn to death out of fear of drowning.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
There you go.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I think it should actually be an oil tanker fire.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Because then the water will be on fire, too.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
That's the worst kind of fire. It's like, how do I put it out?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
The water's on fire.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Exactly.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
It's just more fire.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Wow. All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
We gotta get to some rapid news, a lot of quick stories.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
We have a lot tonight between Logie and myself doing some quick news tonight.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Logie?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Yes, two great games from my childhood coming back on Facebook.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
You know, I think it's awesome.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Oregon Trail and Carmen Sandiego are coming back.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
They're making their return.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Of course, getting a little bit of a facelift as well.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I believe the Oregon Trail one is actually the one that's been on the phones for a while now.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Judging by the screenshots, it kind of resembles that.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate, but who cares?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
It's awesome. Carmen Sandiego and Oregon Trail.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Seriously, kids need to grow up on that.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:46.000
That should be required PC game playing as part of your curriculum in grade school.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And I hope to hell, I hope to hell this song is in it.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Because if they don't have this song in it, then seriously, fuck this game.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000
What about an alternative rock edition of that song?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I might be okay with that. Like a death metal version of this.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Tell me where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Gwar, now doing the theme to where in the world is Carmen Sandiego.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Oh, she's in my pants.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
But yeah, that's going to be coming out very soon.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
February 2nd, the Oregon Trail will be coming.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
And then February 9th, very next week, Carmen Sandiego.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
So that's pretty awesome.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000
So Rob, are you going to be playing these on Facebook?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I'll at least check them out at least once.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
You know you have to try at least the Carmen Sandiego one, so I can post to my wall.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Rob has found Carmen Sandiego. She was under the mattress the whole time.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Click here to find her.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:07.000
It's annoying because we had these giant posters in our computer lab with different country flags and stuff like that.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000
You have to know geography and stuff like that. I don't know geography. I'm good at the Oregon Trail.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
I can shoot animals. That's fine.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I was always super good at where in time was Carmen Sandiego because I am a big history nerd.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I have been since I was a little kid.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
You're just a big nerd, and you have been since you were a little kid.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Yeah, I am.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And that's why we love you.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I was going to say, the Oregon Trail, you know in this one, if it's not already out, in this one, you will be able to pick your friends,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000
like literally from your friends list that will go on the Oregon Trail with you, so I can post to your wall like,

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Hi, Jamie. You just, Jamie, insert real last name here, you just died of dysentery on Rob's Oregon Trail.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Click here to find the cure.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
I'm so going to play that.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
It's called modern medicine.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Here, drink this. We don't know what's in it, but the snake oil lady said it would help.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Why can't we get like further expansions to the Oregon Trail like, you know, zombies.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Zombies have attacked your party.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Oregon Trail 2. Fuck it, we're going back.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Wagons East. Sorry, Chris Farley.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Or no, not Chris Farley, I'm sorry, that's even before Chris Farley.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
That's John Candy.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
That was Canadian Bacon was the other one, remember that?

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Invading Canada.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
So the Japanese folks are getting their hands on Scribblenauts,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:46.000
and they're also getting their hands on a few additional characters and objects added in thanks to a translation from Konami.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:55.000
The Japanese version will feature some wonderful Konami staples, including Old Snake from Metal Gear Solid 4,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Gradis' Vic Viper, and Love Plus' Manaka Tanake.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
And where is Twinbee?

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Where, may I ask, is Twinbee?

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I don't know, well these are just the screenshots that were posted.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Maybe there are more things in there, maybe people haven't tried Twinbee.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Okay, alright, fair enough.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
DDR machine.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000
That's kind of cool though, since a different company kind of works with it in another country,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
it gets some extra easter eggs, it's kind of cool.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000
It's also rumored that if you type in failure, a version of Rock Revolution appears.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Miserable failure. Oh, it's a copy of Rock Revolution.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Thanks to a financial quarterly report from Nintendo, a new Kirby sequel is coming from the developer HAL,

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:58.000
and they have a teaser actually for it, and apparently it looks like a 3D Kirby game, just not all yarny.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.000
So it is going to be a more traditional Kirby game, but still pretty cool looking.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Now with less yarn and more sucking.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Yes.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
But that's a good thing, when you're talking about Kirby.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Pokémon Black and White are actually getting some PC connectivity.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Apparently using, of course they also have the Pokéwalker peripheral, which was from Heart and Gold,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.000
but that won't be used in Black and White at all, but they're going to have the Pokémon Global Link.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
It's a website launching this spring, I guess shortly after the game is released,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:40.000
which allows players to sync their save files to an online profile, giving them an access to a wide range of tools,

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:51.000
including to network with fellow trainers, also check their battle statistics, assigning them worldwide rankings,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:57.000
and granting them eligibility to participate in live regional, national, and global tournaments.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And it says the site will host mini-games which let players collect Pokémon items,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
which they can transfer back to their cartridges as well,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:16.000
and also let them sync a monster from their games to the website and explore their dreams online.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Nerds.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Interesting.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:26.000
And then, let's see, last but not least, Rock Band, of course having more stuff coming out this week.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
This week is actually going to be The Clash and their London Calling album.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.000
You can buy the whole album for $20, or you can buy each individual track for $2 each,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.000
or whatever in your preferred console's space bucks.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:51.000
It includes the tracks London Calling, Brand New Cadillac, Jimmy Jazz, Hateful, Rudy Can't Fail,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Spanish Bombs to the Right Profile, Lost in the Supermarket, Clamp Down, The Guns of Brixton,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Rong M. Boyo, Death and Glory, Coca-Cola, the card sheet, Lever's Rock, Four Horsemen,

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I'm Not Down, and Revolution Rock.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:19.000
And of course, for what looks like London Calling, Rudy Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, Clamp Down,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:25.000
and the card sheet, they do have the Pro Guitar and Bass expansions available for an additional dollar

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
if you're feeling like that.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000
So, look forward to that this week.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Alright, moving on to some other stories, and we're going to start off with some news on Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000
God, they have done such a good job keeping this game relevant, because they let a little bit of news out

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
every week about some new characters that are in the game, so pretty cool.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Cienco and Sentinel have been confirmed as characters that will be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
which is kind of funny, because I thought they had come out and said,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
no more Darkstalkers players, but yet it was a lie.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
So, yep, there it is.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
That'll be fun. I don't know.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Cienco's pretty cool. I remember I used Cienco all the time in Puzzle Fighter.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Or, she had a different name, I thought.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
No, in Puzzle Fighter.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Cienco's lay-light intercession was Mei Mei.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Ah, what about Sentinel? Are you excited about these characters coming to MVC 3, Dark Sakura?

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Sentinel is badass. I just remember playing the Sentinel in the old X-Men Children of the Atom.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
We actually talked about that this morning.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
It came up in discussion on recording Comic Insanity.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Plug plug.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
I think the consensus is that, yeah, cool characters.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I mean, there's still no Strider here, so what's up with that?

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Alright, let's move on to some Sega Genesis stuff that's been added to Steam.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
If you didn't know, you can buy old Sega Genesis games available on Steam,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.000
and that way you can feel good about all those ROMs that you're playing that you're actually paying for them.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
And, you know, it's all through Steam and all that good stuff.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
You can talk to people using the Steam interface and all that.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Alien Soldier, Landstalker, Light Crusader, Shining Force, Shining Force 2, Shining in the Darkness,

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Sonic and Knuckles, Streets of Rage, Streets of Rage 2,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Toejam and Earl, Toejam and Earl in Panic on Frunkatron, and Wonder Boy 3 Monster Lair.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
They are all there.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
You did say Gunstar Heroes, didn't you?

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Yeah, Gunstar Heroes was also recently released, so I think that might be what is already there.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:34.000
But there is now a new collection that I think has some of that stuff, and new stuff as well.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I think those are all the sections with the old games.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Let me see, what is the new stuff here?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Ah, there we go.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Alien Soldier, Gunstar Heroes, Landstalker, Light Crusader, Shining Force, Shining Force 2,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Streets of Rage, Streets of Rage 2, Wonder Boy 3.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Lots of Genesis games. Go look at it on Steam.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
QuakeCon.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.000
If there's any fans of Quake in the house, QuakeCon 2011 is taking place August 4th through 7th this year.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000
It's going to be in Dallas, Texas at the Hilton Anatole.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
So you could also bring in your PC and play some Quake there, LAN.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Have fun.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
It'll be interesting to see what they're going to announce at this.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I don't know if there's maybe going to be some stuff on Rage.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
That whole new...

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Oh, I'm sure there will be.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Yeah, so take a look for that.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Also, there's a brand new iPad and iPhone app for Pac-Man Battle Royale.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Remember that? That's the arcade game that's coming out soon?

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Well, there's actually like a little teaser or whatever you want to say that's available on the iPhone and the iPad.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
It's, I guess, like an actual first level of the game.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
That's kind of cool.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000
So you can actually play that and then check it out in the arcades near you.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
It sucks that it's not a full game.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
It does kind of suck that you can't buy the full game.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Maybe that's coming later after people play some of the arcades. Who knows?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Silent Hill Downpour.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
We have some new stuff on Silent Hill Downpour.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
It's music from the game.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
But here's the thing. It's not by Akira Yamaoka.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Sad face.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Yeah, unfortunately, he's out of the picture.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Remember, he went over what the rumor is he's doing something with EA that maybe we'll see more about at E3 this year.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
He is no longer with the Silent Hill team.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So who have they brought in?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Well, they've brought in Dan Licht.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000
He does Dexter, the music from Dexter on Showtime.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
So I don't know if you know that show.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
There's actually a little clip that's rolling around the internet.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
We can play a little bit for you right now.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
At least I can try.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
See, it has an interesting sound to it.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
But to me, it sounds a little more orchestra.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Whereas Akira Yamaoka felt a little more like dude in the basement banging random things together that made for an awesome soundtrack.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I don't know how to explain it.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
This sounds like he's actually trying to emulate Yamaoka.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:11.000
But, yeah, because it's got some of the same, like the mandolin in the background and some of the...

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I really think he's trying to emulate Yamaoka's style.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Well, sure. Everybody loved him.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
So it'll be interesting to see what this full thing looks like when it comes out.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Obviously, you can't tell from just a minute and a half clip.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Alright, that's going to do it for Rapid Fire News. Let's move into some Twitter topics tonight.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
And see what you guys are tweeting us at twitter.com slash o-l-r.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Oh, a few tweets tonight.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Let's see, Spazinator wants to give us an update on what's going on in the video marketplace.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Not too much new in terms of freebies to announce aside from a preview episode of An Idiot Abroad on both PSN and XBL.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
What the hell is An Idiot Abroad? I've never heard of that.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Surely that's not an anime. Is that a reality show?

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I've never heard of this before. I'm Wikipedia-ing it right now.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
An Idiot Abroad.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Let's see, an entertainment travel documentary on Sky One and Science Channel.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Starring Carl Plinkinton.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And Ricky Jervis is in it, too. Well, that's pretty cool, I guess, if you're a fan of him.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
An Idiot Abroad.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Let's see, SHO 100 Matt is tweeting us, resident hockey fan here with some game-related news.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:34.000
A minor league hockey team celebrates SNES NHL 94 style.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
He gives us a link there.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000
And, let's see here, I guess, what is this?

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I was playing on my old console, Super Nintendo, one day and I scored a spectacular goal.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
And this is from one of the goaltenders of the Blazers.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Everyone just stopped and threw their sticks over their heads.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
And I thought it was the funniest thing ever.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:00.000
So it looks like when they actually scored a goal recently...

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:07.000
They started waving their sticks over their heads just like they did in the game. That's cute.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
That's funny. I like that.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
That guy doesn't even have a stick. Look at him.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:19.000
What happened to that guy? He lost his stick. He's just waving his hands in the air.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I don't know why that's really funny, but it is.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And SHO 100 Matt continues with another tweet saying,

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Also, two friends got me this awesome painting by 8-bit video game painter Adam Shub.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I guess is the name of the person that did that.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
And I can't see the link that he put...

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Oh, I see this one, though.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Oh, is that like the Earthbound?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I get linked to a DeviantArt page called Square Painter.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.000
That's kind of cool. There's like a Ninja Gaiden picture and an Earthbound picture. That's pretty rad.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Very cool.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Dark Tetsuya tweets us and says,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:58.000
On the topic of Daft Punk, any of you guys ever seen Interstellar 5-5-5 or Interstellar 4-5?

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Freaking epic anime set to their Discovery album.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I've seen the one clip, like One More Time was a whole little anime thing.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
They all are.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000
But I haven't seen the whole thing together. I've only seen that one song.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.000
It's all by the anime artist. It's the guy that did Galaxy Express and that kind of stuff.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
But yeah, I've watched the whole thing. I actually had the DVD at one point.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Might still have the DVD. I don't know.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
But yeah, I've watched it. It's pretty awesome.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Gotcha.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Got a tweet as well from Leo Shen.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.000
The MBC, Marvel vs. Capcom of course, 3 final boss has been leaked.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000
And we get to a YouTube here that says Galactus boss fight in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
That apparently is the final boss.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
There's this whole fighting going on on a TV.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000
This is probably very no-no that this is out here on the internet, but now it's out.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
So there it is. They're fighting Galactus. That's the final boss.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
He was awfully stunted for Galactus.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I think he's in the background.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Let me see. Yep, here he comes.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Oh yeah.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
There you go.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Yeah, that's cool.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
So what you're fighting is Pinky.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Mm-hmm.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Wasn't he the boss in like one of the other ones? Wasn't it 2 he also the boss in?

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I thought it was Onslaught.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I think Onslaught was the boss in the first one.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Damn.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
The second one, no I don't-

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
You suck.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I don't remember now actually.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
I know it was in Galactus.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:32.000
And everyone keeps picking on Galactus. All he wants is a sandwich made out of, you know, a planet.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Alright.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Tigerclaw sent us some links, but sadly they are stories that are coming up later, so I gotta save those for a little later.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
That does it for Twitter tonight.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us some tweets in the future.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
We'll get to those later on.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Alright, let's move on with some more stories.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Loki.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Yes.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:56.000
So, this is kind of cool I guess if you're either lazy or you are disabled.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000
For me I'd say it's because I'm lazy.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:08.000
But MLB 11, they are including a one button association for the signaled virtual athletes mode.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
And basically what it'll allow you to do is play the game using one button.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:20.000
And it's gonna have AI handling all the fielding and the player only needs to press one button in order to swing the bat or pitch.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:28.000
And it allows gamers who might not be able to throw a baseball in real life or wield a dual shock controller ease of play.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
So that's pretty awesome.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And apparently the mode was inspired by Hans Smith, a baseball superfan with cerebral palsy whose limited mobility made it impossible for him to play a real baseball game as well as a video game as well.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:49.000
And Sony San Diego added him to last year's MLB game as an avatar.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:56.000
And then this year they went one step further with the disability friendly gameplay mode.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
So that's pretty sweet.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Well that's kind of cool. I like that they kind of did that, you know.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Do you get to play online in the one button mode? I don't know, I can see people that don't need to be using that mode using that.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
But hopefully that's not the case.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Well if you think about it, if you could do that, you know.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Get matched up against other people who are using that mode or something, I don't know.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Well that's kind of cool.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Eat a pizza and play the game at the same time.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:30.000
That's kind of like, some role playing games let you do that. Like, I remember, it was like Final Fantasy or something had the one hand mode where you could just, oh yeah, Bayonetta had it too.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Bayonetta had a one button mode.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
That's right.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I'm not sure if that was for disability though.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.000
It probably wasn't actually, so we shouldn't make a mockery of a good thing that they're trying to do here in this game.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
I think that's kind of cool that they're making it more accessible.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
One handed mode.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.000
So, there's a big big difference between that one handed mode.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Alright, well if you think maybe there should be more games like this that are easily accessible to those folks, or maybe there's just a really cool idea you have for an indie game, maybe this site is something you want to take a look at.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:10.000
It's kind of a spinoff of a site called Kickstarter, which honestly I had never heard of until this project kind of came across my path.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000
8BitFunding is the name of the site. 8BitFunding.com.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000
It's what they call crowd sourcing.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Basically, you can donate to different projects and you might get something or a perk in return.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000
So, there might be these games that need help.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
They need money to fund the games or what have you.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:38.000
And if you buy into it, maybe with a certain amount, maybe they'll promise you 10% of the gross receipts.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Or maybe you'll get a cameo in the game.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Or maybe the developer will come over to your house or something like that or develop something for you in exchange.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:53.000
So, kind of an interesting little thing is when I was first reading this, I was like, okay, so this is basically like a PayPal donation button.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Donate to my game. What is the big deal about this?

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
But it's kind of some of the perks that they're offering.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
In fact, I'm kind of looking at the site right now.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Unfortunately, a lot of these games have not really raised a whole lot of money.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.000
They did the same type of thing with this. I think it was on the, not this 8-bit funding type, but the other one that was group sourcing.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.000
It was for the Cthulhu, was it Cthulhu Saves the World or something like that?

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Yeah, I remember that.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:26.000
They were doing the PC version and having all these different things that you could donate and get a character in the game and stuff like that.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Right. You know, I'm looking at some of these projects and all of them are looking for like $20,000, which I'm imagining must be the cost of a dev kit or to get the game online.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I don't know. But let's see, like I notice the game that has the most money right now is The Boo Keeper.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000
$105 is how much they've raised towards their $20,000 goal.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000
But the site is still new, so who knows. I'm trying to look at some of these little perks they offer here.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000
They're trying to get this in 86 days. Oh, they have like a little video as well from the developer. That's kind of neat.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:04.000
And they actually will give a game for a $5 project or two games for $20.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:11.000
A thank you package for $50. That's kind of interesting. Give your voice to a character for $1,000.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:17.000
So that's kind of neat that they have like little perks like that if you really believe in one of these games.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000
And I like how they have like the little video from the developer telling you a little more about the game. So that's pretty cool.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:30.000
So check that out. Even if you don't have any money, it's kind of neat just to hear about some of the indie games and some indie developers and the trials and tribulations they go through.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:39.000
8bitfunding.com. What I also noticed was here was a magazine was posted on here that they're trying to fund an actual magazine for $1,000.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
It's an indie gaming magazine. Kind of neat.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Maybe we need to get some of these people on our show to hawk their products. Who knows? Could be interesting. I like hearing about new ideas.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Alright. So 8bitfunding.com. Let's move on to some more stories. Dark Soccer?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Well, how about something on Kid Icarus?

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
How about it?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Well, it's not going to be out until after E3. Or Zelda for that matter.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:10.000
They're actually saying that, of course, we've mentioned earlier that neither of those are going to be launch titles for the 3DS.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:19.000
That they are going to be out early June which is right after E3. So it's speculated.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Maybe that's going to be because they're going to be improved maybe? We could hope.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I don't know though. When you said the news, I couldn't help but feel like this.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Yeah.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:41.000
But it's kind of the news I think we were all expecting, honestly. I mean, if the game wasn't coming out of launch.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I was convinced Kid Icarus was going to make it out of launch though. They made such a big deal out of that at E3.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.000
So it's kind of, last year anyway. So it's kind of shocking that it is delayed, but again.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
It's just teasing, Rob. Teasing.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Well, you've got to make sure the game is great. Don't release a mediocre game.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
It's gaming foreplay.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I'm all for them taking more time to do it if they need the time to make the game great.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:12.000
So, it's just a bummer they didn't have anything done, ready to go with the exception of, I guess, Nintendogs and, what is it, the submarine game or whatever other weird things they have.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Oh, they're doing Pilotwings.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
That's true. Pilotwings might be interesting.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:22.000
I don't know though. I didn't feel Pilotwings 64 the same way I did the original S&S version, which is still one of my favorites.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
I love Pilotwings on the SNES.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000
So, there you go.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Anyhow, Loki, what do you have for us? The mailbag is coming up soon, by the way, you guys.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and soon your calls, the FUs of the Week, and so much more. Loki?

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:43.000
There's a lot more disappointing Congressman coming from California. I swear to God, it's just...

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
What do we have? Idiots working in Congress over here?

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
No, I didn't vote for him.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000
This time it's not Lee, though, so it is a different Congressman.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Joe Baca. He introduced against legislation back in 2009 that required games to display labels of warnings between violent video games and aggressive behavior.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Now, apparently, he's come back and now he's trying to pitch a similar thing.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.000
He's saying that he wants a warning to be put on these games.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.000
So, warning, excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:30.000
And it says, I guess, the 2009 act failed to gain momentum, but he's now relabeled it the Video Game Health Labeling Act of 2011.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:36.000
And it's basically the same act with the same goal, putting warning labels on games rated Teen and above.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:47.000
And apparently now, I guess the only difference this time around is that he's gained support of Virginia Congressman Frank Wolf.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Which, I don't understand where a Virginia Congressman has any play in California, but whatever.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Anyways, it says, just as we warn smokers of health consequences of tobacco, we should warn parents and children about the growth and growing scientific evidence demonstrating a relationship between violent video games and violent behavior.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:21.000
As a parent and grandparent, I think it's important to have people know everything they can about the extremely violent nature of some of these games.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Which is great, because that's what's on the ESRB label. It shows you what kind of content's in those games.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000
So you don't need to do this. I don't understand what the point is.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:40.000
But apparently they are trying to move that forward.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.000
I think we probably have a message for the Congress people involved in this.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Shut the fuck up!

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.000
That's how I feel.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Sounds good to me.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Like, you know, I mean, if you're gonna put warning labels on video games, you're gonna put warnings on movies, you're gonna put warnings on sugary candy, may it cause your kid to have a short attention span?

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:14.000
If you, I mean, I'm sorry, but first off, violent video games don't affect everybody the same way, and there hasn't been, there's been studies that go both ways with that. There's nothing definitive about it.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And we already have a label on the box that shows what kind of content's in the game. It shows if it's violent.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
And if you read the back of the box, you can get a pretty good idea too.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
You don't need, you know, another label.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:41.000
You know, if you're gonna buy a game called Zombie Massacre, you know, 2011, the back of the box, you know, is probably gonna indicate to you that it's probably pretty violent, and that you will be massacring zombies in the game.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:49.000
You know, you're not suddenly gonna get, you know, a game with puppets and rainbows and, I don't know, whatever. Stupid.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Puppet Rainbow Massacre.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
That would be a little bit different.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
They did that in an episode of Angel.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I mean, I'm sorry, but isn't there, like, a budget to be balanced? Aren't there jobs that need to be created?

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Yeah, this stuff does cost money. I mean, and why are these congressmen, you know, like, wasting time on this stuff?

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Seriously.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Especially California congressmen.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
There's a word for it.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Two words, actually.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Budget allocation.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Funding.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:26.000
In what? They're trying to get donations for their 2012 campaign by pleasing some moral superiority board?

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:36.000
It's the stuff like that that actually pulls in other funds for the different areas of, uh, the different committees and different stuff that they're trying to allocate money to.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
They have the big problems because they need to go through and do a whole big audit.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000
And they need to have the audit done by someone not in government but by an outside party.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.000
So, in other words, if this type of movement didn't exist, the committee might get folded?

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Probably.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Then fold the fucking committee!

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
This is a waste of our goddamn time!

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Everybody's goddamn time!

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Agreed.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
One more time, Congressman Joe Baca, I'm expressing my First Amendment right and telling you-

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
This is also Baca.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Whatever.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
That's funny.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Moron.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Shut the fuck up!

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Thank you, Pendlet.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.000
But, that was funny because, never mind.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Anyhow.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.000
If that's the best thing that committee can come up with, then it deserves to be folded.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Moving on.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I can hear it in my head now.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
You mad?

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Yes, I am mad.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Alright, let me move on. Sorry.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Sarian.net. Remember that website? That was the website where you could play action Sierra games, adventure games, like King's Quest and all this stuff.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
You could play it on your iPad.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000
And we were all sitting here going, just a matter of time before this thing gets shut down.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Yep, we are waiting for this thing to get shut down.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Guess what happened, guys?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
It got shut down this week. That's right.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000
And the letter from Activision's legal counsel got posted on the website for everybody to read.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
And I liked how some of this email went.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:12.000
While we appreciate your dedication to the Sierra Classic Library and understand that you are a fan of these games, Activision has not authorized the development or distribution of these games via your website.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Accordingly, we must demand that you immediately cease any further distribution or exploitation, I like that word, of the Sierra games on your website.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Now, as much as you want to paint Activision as the big bad evil people, I don't know.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000
They kind of do have a point. I mean, it is their games and this whole thing, posting them public, you know.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
But if you're not going to do anything with it, then what the hell are you doing?

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:43.000
However, it could be argued that these games are available for sale on good old games and on Steam.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000
So if you're going to get these games, then you should do them the legitimate way.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:53.000
And if Activision wanted to do an iPad release of the game, well, then this website is kind of getting in the way.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Well, there is another interesting development that happened this week that's worth mentioning, and that is that it wasn't totally shut down after the cease and desist.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:10.000
It looks like Activision ended up giving Sarian approval to continue running in a limited capacity.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Sarian.net is now able to publish the first game of any series in its multiplayer HTML5 form.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.000
So I guess this whole new little way of doing it is available.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000
However, the iPad versions are no longer there because they might want to develop it sometimes.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000
And Activision has allowed at least that, which I think is somewhat generous.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000
There are also links to buy the games on Steam on the website.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
This is free advertising for retro titles.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:46.000
It is. So, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like, as much as you want to hate Activision, you can't say they're not doing anything with this.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:58.000
You are able to buy the games legitimately out there somewhere. So, I don't know, it's a little bit hard for me to get mad at Activision for cease and desisting, somebody trying to give that away for free.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:07.000
It does pain me that Activision continues to do nothing new in this genre, but I guess at least we always have the silver lining.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Which, by the way, Episode 3 was delayed.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
But it'll be coming out when it's ready.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
I see what you did there.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
That's right.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Let's go to the mailbag!

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you can send us your emails every week.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
And I gotta say, guys, the emailbag is still in a pretty sad state.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:34.000
We got one email this week, and it's not signed, so I'll just say it's from Adam H.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Wanting us to talk about the PSP2 or the NGP.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
And linking us to the blog where we can talk about that.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Well, I think we did go over pretty much the big stuff.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
And done.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
That's right, we did go over the big stuff in Part A.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000
I will give the courtesy of looking at this website here and see if there's anything we didn't cover.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Because you never know, there might be little stuff that falls through the crack or whatever.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Let's see.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Nope, screenshots, got those.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Uncharted Portable, yeah.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
5-inch organic light-emitting display.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
We already mentioned that.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Or did you use the word organic?

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
I did OLED.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Okay.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
6-axis is in it, GPS.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Yeah, I think we covered all this, dude. Sorry.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
But, hey.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
There's some nice little pictures. I like the whole back touchpad.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Looks kind of funny with all the little PlayStation symbols over and over.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000
So yes, our mailbag is in kind of a sad state tonight, I'm sorry to say.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you want to help us out for future weeks.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It'll fold your laundry, wash the cat.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
That's right.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000
So meanwhile, let's get into some FUs, some angst.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:52.000
I have three FUs, and I love you.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
My FUs go to-

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Aw, I love you too.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000
My FUs goes to being sick, because I hate it.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:09.000
My second FU goes to the CW for playing Supernatural by a week, because dammit, I've been waiting for this damn episode.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000
It's like, stop teasing me.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:25.000
And then FU to all of the people in the torrent community who decided to capitalize on the fact that certain people don't actually watch active TV and download the episodes as a torrent and decide to put out a virus torrent.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Which, thankfully, the moment you see the Windows error, you know, codec thing, you have to stop it before it goes to whatever site to update the codec.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
So it doesn't, you know, actually virus you.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
So yeah, stupid.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000
And my love you goes to Dan, because he's been taking good care of me.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Aw.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
You're a little sick there, Rob.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Yeah, I mean, I think I caught whatever you guys have.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Rob's got our plague.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000
All right.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Loki, you have an FU of the week.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Mainly just to Xbox 360s being so delicate and fragile that they'll break within five minutes.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000
What, did you drop one?

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I didn't drop one.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I didn't have to drop one.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
I turned it on.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:15.000
And then I switched the monitor resolution and it went ehhh and died.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
So no.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
The original consoles, man.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
I swear, if you have a Xenon console, it's going to die.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:26.000
It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
That sucks.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
I don't have a lot of FUs.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Things are relatively well right now.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000
So I'll just say FU to money or lack thereof.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Never having enough of it.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000
FU to Disneyland being crowded yesterday.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
That's never fun to go on a crowded day.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Everybody else needs to go somewhere else when I'm there.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.000
And I guess FU to the fact that I didn't get to spend enough time there.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
It really was just like a fast, fast trip.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
So, yeah.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
That's really it.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Otherwise, things are pretty good.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
If those are my FUs, then things are pretty well in my world.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Let's move on.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
A couple more stories for you guys.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000
And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Please make sure before you call us,

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Echo123, if you are on Skype, you must, must, must test yourself first.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I think even Skype puts in there now,

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
click this button to make a test call.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
You need to do that before you go on the radio.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Yes, listen to the nice lady that says, you know,

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Hello, welcome to the Skype call testing service.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
You need to hear her before you hear us, so please do that now.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
But if you're using the phone, that's easy.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000
You can just pick it up and call.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
All right, but we're not taking the calls just yet.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
We got a couple more stories for you first.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Loki.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:40.000
One other thing that was announced during the PlayStation conference,

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
and it wasn't necessarily the PlayStation phone,

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
it was the PlayStation Suite.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:49.000
And what the PlayStation Suite is, is actually a couple things.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:55.000
First off, it's gonna be a PlayStation store that's gonna be available for Android phones.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:03.000
They'll allow you to purchase different PlayStation, you know, things,

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:08.000
whether it be PlayStation 1 games or other, you know, PSP minis or whatever.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Those are gonna be available as well.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:16.000
But you may remember when there were some of the leaked videos of, like, the PlayStation phone out,

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000
this was actually one of the things they could have been running on.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Of course, they were running a third-party homebrew PlayStation emulator,

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000
but I mean, assuming that works, and obviously this works just fine.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000
And of course, some of the games that they're mentioning that are gonna be available

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
are actually early PlayStation 1 games.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Cool Borders 2, Syphon Filter, and Rallycross, Wild Arms, and MIDI Evil.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Yay, the same fucking PS1 games I already played on the PS3 again.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
How about PS2 games?

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Come on, there's a huge market.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000
You know, PS2 is like ten years old, some of the early games at this point.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000
The oomph to be able to do PlayStation 2.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Well, I thought the NGP is gonna bring the PS3 experience in your pocket,

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
and it's a powerful fucking little thing.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
It can't play a PS2 game? Really?

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Well, this isn't for the NGP, this is for phones.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Oh, my bad.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
This is for Android phones.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Or the Android iOS.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Because we can't really say it's just for phones now,

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
since they do have tablets now with the Android iOS.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Oh, I remember something about this is all gonna tie into the NGP as well, too, right?

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Android OS, not iOS, what am I saying?

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Yeah, so it's a way to get PlayStation content out there on more than just the PlayStation phone.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000
So, neat.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000
But honestly, though, I mean, just looking at...

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Unless you have that PlayStation phone, I can imagine this is gonna suck,

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.000
just because, I mean, just look at the controls.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
It takes up, like, so much screen space, it's just ridiculous.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Yeah, touch controls are ridiculous, too.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000
You need tangible buttons. Forget it otherwise, honestly.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Yeah.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
That's the one thing we've learned from iPhone gaming.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Very few iPhone games really, really work.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
They have to be designed for that touch.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Things like Cut the Rope work, because it's very easy.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Things like, I guess, Angry Birds, although I've never played it, work,

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
because it's based around the touch controls.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Things like a port of Mega Man fail,

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
because you need tangible controls in order to be able to play it.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
I will say that Espagaluda worked very well with touch controls.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Really?

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Yeah, but that's because it has auto-fire and stuff.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
I did it without auto-fire.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
It actually plays really well.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
And Mushihime-sama was really fun.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000
I don't know. I just, I need tangible buttons.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
I thought that was all Sony's thing with the move.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Don't you like buttons?

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Whatever.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Alright, one more story for you guys before the Skype line tonight,

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000
and it has to do with World of Warcraft, but it's kind of an interesting one,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000
because you know where WoW goes, other MMOs tend to follow.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
This is kind of interesting.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000
WoW has gone after gold sellers in a whole new way.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.000
They have successfully petitioned PayPal

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
to issue notices to all the big gold selling companies that are out there,

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.000
that if they don't stop WoW's virtual currency selling,

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.000
then their accounts will be suspended permanently.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Very interesting, because these places are in other countries and so forth,

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000
and they accept PayPal as a method of payment,

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
which a lot of folks don't want to give companies,

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000
well, folks shouldn't be using these fucking things in the first place,

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
but on the other hand, when they do use them,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
they don't want to use their real credit card info,

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.000
so they'll often use PayPal.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Well, now they've kind of cut off that bridge,

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
so I think that's kind of cool that they did that.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
That was a smart way to go about doing it.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000
So yeah, that's how they're going after it.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Cut out the middle man.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.000
And they could kind of strong arm PayPal too,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000
because I'm pretty sure they take PayPal as a method of payment for the game itself,

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
so they could tell PayPal either do this

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:50.000
or we're going to stop taking your thing as a form of payment.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
They could kind of strong arm it like that.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.000
I'm not saying that's what they did, but I could imagine that being part of the conversation.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Why not?

01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Makes sense.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Play hardball.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:05.000
But I did like having PayPal for like for Star Trek Online,

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000
because I would buy Cryptic Points to get my unlocks.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Right, but those are official.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
That's not like buying gold.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.000
No, but I mean, I think it's convenient to have it there,

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000
like if you want to get like a little thing here or there.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.000
And certainly, you pay 10 bucks and get 1200 points,

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000
which I bought tons of stuff with my points.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:35.000
So I think that they need to be a little bit more judicious with what they will and won't accept via PayPal.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Yeah, and honestly, if you buy gold online for WoW,

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
your own account is going to get hacked inevitably,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000
and you're just encouraging those people to continue to hack accounts,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
because where do you think that gold comes from?

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Hardworking players, you know?

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.000
So if you buy gold, you suck.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000
There are people that will help you out if there's something you really need to buy.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Get a guild.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Don't buy gold online.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
I heart the guild.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Oh yeah, because they've helped you out.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Yeah, I know.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Find a guild.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
You don't need to buy gold.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Find a guild of nice people.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
And don't steal from your guild.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Yeah, don't steal from your guild.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.000
If you're in the game to just profit profit and steal everything from your guild,

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
then you're in the game for the wrong reasons.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Play the auction house game if money making is what you want.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Buy out a certain item and then sell it for triple.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I don't know.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
All right, let's open up the Skype line right now.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
The phones are open.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Take your calls on any topic we've talked about tonight.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Maybe you have a comment on the NGP itself.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Maybe you want to talk 3DS.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Maybe you want to talk about that whole PS3 hacking mess,

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
or something we haven't brought up yet.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Whenever you want to talk about the phones are open,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:47.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.000
While we wait for those calls to come in,

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Loki, do you have any quick last minute stories for us?

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
No, not really.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Well, not yet.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Actually, that Galactus video, that was someone that was playing on a pirated Xbox 360 version.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Naughty, naughty.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Naughty, naughty.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Because you can see the 360 in the background there.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Uh-oh.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Uh, let's see.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Some other fun stuff we could talk about here.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Um, this is kind of neat.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
We haven't mentioned this yet.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Platinum's new game that's coming out, Max Anarchy.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Well, at least it's how it's known in other places.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
It's coming over as Anarchy Reigns.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
It's kind of an MMO brawler game,

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000
and it also features the main character from Madworld,

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
but in full color this time.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.000
And he's actually kind of in all the trailers and stuff.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Honestly, though, I kind of like him better black and white.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000
He doesn't look that cool when he's not in black and white.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I don't know. That's just my opinion.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Alright, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Hi, this is Bazinator.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Hey, Spazinator. What's on your mind, buddy?

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Well, since it's too much the topic of the night,

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:03.000
I just want to chime in on the NGP or whatever it's called.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Whatever they end up calling it, sure. What are your thoughts?

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Well, even though some people within the dial game community

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.000
would like to pick me as Sony fanboy,

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.000
I'm a little hesitant to even consider getting the NGP.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Although the system does sound nice on paper,

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:33.000
but the truth is, even with my PSP, I very rarely touch it.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Hell, nowadays I will use it for downloading podcasts and whatnot,

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.000
and that's about it.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Let me back up. Why did you abandon your PSP?

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Was it a lack of the games that you have to play,

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.000
or what caused you, I don't know, are you a DS player now,

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
or what caused you to abandon the PSP?

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Well, I was a DS player for a while, too.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000
I had both systems, but truth be told,

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:10.000
there's more games on the PS3 and the 360 that I would much rather play.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:16.000
For example, on the 360, I constantly play Game Room,

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:22.000
and on PS3, I play a lot of Super Stardust HD, so on and so forth,

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000
and between the two main consoles,

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
there's more games on there that I'm interested in,

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
as opposed to handheld.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Considering that I'm on the budget,

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I have to watch how much I spend on games,

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000
and don't really have enough money to go all the way around,

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000
I would rather play my games on consoles, as opposed to handheld,

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.000
because really, isn't the point of handhelds to go out and about

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.000
and play them when you're not at home?

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:59.000
And I'm usually home pretty much 24-7.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Well, at first, yeah, I did play my PSP a lot initially,

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000
playing the Darkstalkers games and the ports of PS2 games,

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:14.000
but I just generally find myself playing the system less and less.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000
So it's kind of the price that freaks you out, too, though,

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:22.000
because you mentioned that you have a very limited budget,

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.000
kind of like I mentioned earlier.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
There's just certain people, especially in this economy this day and age,

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
that don't have a lot of the extra money,

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
and they kind of know this is going to be expensive.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.000
So is it kind of like the price that scares you, too?

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Yeah, basically, yeah.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I live under $800 a month, and that basically,

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:51.000
that $800 a month not even has to go towards rent, food,

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:55.000
my time order bill, so on and so forth.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000
There's not a lot of room for entertainment out there.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Yeah.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Granted, I managed to keep my expenses low

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.000
because the cost of living in Buffalo, New York is pretty low,

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
but still, even with that,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:14.000
that leaves me with roughly $200 a month that if I'm lucky,

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.000
I'm able to save and whatnot.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000
In fact, it took me like a year just to save up for this netbook

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
that I just recently got.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Well, let me ask you this.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Let me ask you this, though, because obviously,

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
the system is expensive.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Do you think you would use or try to save up anyway

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:36.000
for one of the competitors to a PSP2?

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Is there something that maybe interests you more about the 3DS

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
or maybe even the iPad, you could say,

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
as a competitor of the NGP, whatever it's called?

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Is there either of those that maybe interest you more

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
that you would save up for, or no,

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000
I'm not interested in this wave of technology at all?

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000
It's kind of hard to say just now

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000
because obviously, all those systems aren't quite out yet.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.000
If I do consider going out and buying any handheld,

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000
whatever, whether it be 3DS or PSP2 or what have you,

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:15.000
I would have to wait just to pull a figure out,

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.000
but let's say a year, year and a half,

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
wait to see what comes out for whatever system

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000
and see if those games would interest me.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Then maybe, yeah, I'll consider getting them,

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000
but if nothing of interest comes out for me,

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:36.000
like at least bare minimum, I don't know, 15 games at least,

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
then I'd just say forget it.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.000
So in other words, it's the games that are on the system

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
that are going to make it or break it for you.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Yeah, and they would have to be like exclusive games,

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:56.000
not found on the home systems, no ports of any kind,

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000
I mean truly exclusive stuff or interoperability.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.000
I hear you, buddy.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
It's our golden rule of gaming,

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
a system is only as good as the games that are on it,

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:10.000
so I think it's a smart approach for a budget gamer to wait and see.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Let the people that have more disposable income

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
kind of beta test everything for you, I suppose.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
So Spazinator, I've got to let you go to get more calls,

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000
but thank you as always, and who knows,

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
maybe you'll win a contest at a local store,

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
maybe win one of these guys for free.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000
I'll be hoping for you.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.000
All right.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Yeah.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Have a good one, buddy.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR is our number,

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
if you want to give us a call.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.000
SSG100Matt agrees in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
The price will be key.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Bonds006 says, I am PC till death.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
That's an interesting way of looking at it,

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
especially from the whole budget perspective,

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000
is that, well, I have this PC anyway.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
There's tons and tons of games available on PC.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Why even bother with a handheld or even a console?

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
I've got everything I need right in my PC.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
That's the way a lot of people look at it, surprisingly enough.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000
877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Do we have any other last-minute stories, Loki, to hold us over?

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Do we get more ringy rings?

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Let's just see here what I've got here.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
What can you pull out of your butt, Loki?

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:19.000
What can I pull out of my butt?

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Let's see, can I have this all pulled up, too?

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I don't want to know what Loki can pull out of his butt.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.000
I meant, like, story-wise.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Not actual.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Yes.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
There was a whole lot, actually.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.000
It's funny, this week, I was surprised that there wasn't a whole lot of news

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
other than the PSP stuff.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Sure, other than that big press conference, that's really it, I guess.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.000
It was just kind of like, wow, isn't that P or NGP awesome?

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
It's so awesome.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I wonder how much it's going to be.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.000
And then, you know, 3DS was like, anyone remember about me?

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
I just got announced last week.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Oh, I think by the time the 3DS comes out, that will change quite a bit.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Yeah.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Well, we got another call.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000
You're saved.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
You can find something else for after this.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Who's this?

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Hi, this is us for show on demand.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Well, hey, I haven't heard from you in a while.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
How you doing?

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I'm doing good.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:21.000
I actually wanted to kind of give a mini review on a game that no one's really talked about.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Let's hear it.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
But it's gotten a lot of controversy.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
I played Galgun for the Xbox 360.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Galgun, okay, okay.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Set the stage.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000
What type of game is Galgun?

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Galgun is a very perverted shooter.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
It's a dating sim shooter, I should say.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
All dating sims should be shooters.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Okay.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000
I'm interested so far.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:51.000
So it's gotten a lot of controversy in it because Microsoft...

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:55.000
I posted a video in the chat room.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:00.000
There's a lot of panty shots and a lot of questionable material in it.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:06.000
So a friend of mine has a Japanese 360, so we bought it.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:14.000
And we played it, and I felt immediately dirty afterwards.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:20.000
You spray your love on them, by the way.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
This game looks disgusting.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:26.000
This looks like Elibits, but with girls.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Little school girls.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.000
I'm sure they're all 18 or over, I'm sure.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Yeah, of course, of course. And you also get to shoot at teachers and all that, so...

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.000
This looks like Elibits. Is this like Elibits?

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Remember that game on the Wii?

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Yeah, well, you know what the funny thing when you mention that is?

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:49.000
The whole game has the feeling of a Wii game that was rejected,

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:53.000
but it was ended up cut out on the 360.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
They wouldn't give up.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:59.000
All right, so usually games like this end up being crappy,

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
but you felt dirty afterwards.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Was she tied up by a plant? What the hell was that?

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
A tentacle.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
There's a boss battle in it.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Well, the whole thing is centered around when you start the game,

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
you have to choose a girl that you're interested in.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Now, the whole thing is you're trying to go through your high school and all that

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
to try to get with this girl.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000
And you have to go through all these women who are going after you,

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:25.000
hitting you with postcards and, you know, typical anime stuff.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Oh my goodness, postcards.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
He might get a paper cut.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Yeah.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000
So what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to use a gun

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:40.000
that shoots pheromones at the teenage girls

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.000
that makes them drop down in ecstasy.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
So it's like your love gun.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Yeah, it's a love gun.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.000
I see.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.000
And, you know, there's a special mode where you can zero in on a girl

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:55.000
and shoot her at specific parts of her body, like her legs.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.000
So there's like a Fallout 3 mode?

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Yeah, there is.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.000
They're in the back.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000
And, you know, there'll be parts where she'll try to stop you

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
with her earring and, you know, certain things.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Are you allowed to shoot these girls in the butt or do they not like that?

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Yes, you can shoot them in the butt.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Wow.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
And, you know, it's funny because, you know, the game's so dynamic

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:22.000
that, you know, different girls have different hot spots, I should say.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Where you get an ecstasy bonus, as it's called.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Okay.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000
So, Matt, this is either like the best game ever or the worst game ever.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000
So where does it fall?

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
It's both.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000
It's both.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Because it's just so fucked up.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000
And you know what?

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
I was looking at it.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:44.000
The people who made this game made a lot of kids' games.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
They made, you know, the X-Men Zero series.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.000
They actually made Mega Man 9 and 10.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:53.000
So this is their chance to release some steam, so to speak.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Yeah, I guess so.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000
But, you know, the whole thing is, you know, it's very ridiculous.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000
And, you know, it's kind of tough to play because it's a dating statement.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
It's all in Japanese.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
There's no English.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
And it's never going to come in America.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000
So we're kind of guessing through the whole thing.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
But, you know, there's a lot of minigames and bonus stages.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
You know, they're ridiculous.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.000
But it's a ridiculous game.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Ikuma JP is in our chat room and he actually lives in Japan and he says,

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
This game does not exist.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:30.000
You might have to check, like, the back room of a store.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Like, I don't know how they have it set up in Japan.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
But I'm looking at this on YouTube.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:38.000
This looks real and I've heard of this before.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I just want to see the tentacle monster one more time.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Wait, was that sheep?

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000
What the fuck?

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:51.000
I would say if Loki has a Japanese 360, you should get it.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Just for the last.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Loki, I think you need to bring a copy of this to the show one night.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Come on, it's episode 400 next week.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
What do you say?

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
You need to figure this out.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
You need to get one of these.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000
You need to import one of these real quick and get it over here to the show.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Expedite the shipping.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
All right.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.000
So anyhow.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000
That's bad.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
You know, I had to take a long bath after this.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
It just felt so terrible.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.000
I'm sure those girls have to take a long bath too to wash what they got off.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
I'm watching him shoot the teachers.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.000
All right.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.000
All right, Matt.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I want this game.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Thank you for bringing this into our lives.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
How can we ever repay you?

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.000
I totally want this game.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
I totally think you should get a game.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000
All right.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Thank you for the call, Matt, and bringing this game into our lives.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Take care, buddy.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Bye.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Oops, I missed.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Oops, I accidentally hung up on him early.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Sorry, Matt.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000
All right.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:43.000
1877 game OLR.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Our username on Skype.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Orange on the radio.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.000
AkumaJP says, just kidding.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.000
I have seen it.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Estacy shot.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000
That's funny.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
It does totally look like a rejected Wii game.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.000
All right.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.000
We've got time for a couple more calls, I suppose.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000
I don't know if you had another story for us, Loki?

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Just real quick stuff.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
No Kid Icarus or Zelda until after E3.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Yeah.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
DarkSaga did report on that.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
You were probably playing Grand Theft Auto.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
No, I wasn't playing Grand Theft Auto.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.000
You were playing Galgun.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.000
I was not playing Galgun.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Of course, let's see here.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Seriously, we have like, Atlas is bringing out Divinity II, the Dragon Knight saga, which

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:26.000
is kind of an update to Divinity II with all the extra bonuses.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:30.000
That's coming out in May or April.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:35.000
By the way, there was some chatter earlier that accused me of never listening to Loki.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000
I just want to point out it's been proven it goes both ways.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Oh, I never listen to anybody.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.000
It's called multitasking.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:48.000
That's how we do this live show where we interact with the chat room, talk to each other, and

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
take calls, like the call we have on the line right now.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Who's this?

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Hey, this is excellent.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Hi, how are you, buddy?

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Doing good.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000
I don't know how I'm going to, I don't know what to say now.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
I'm flabbergasted compared to that last caller.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.000
That's all right.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000
That's the one update.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
I don't know if I can do that.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:13.000
You're becoming like the Ranma of the new year.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
You're getting on this show every week.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
That's interesting.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
But hey, if no one else is calling in.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.000
No, I try not to.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.000
It's all you, buddy.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.000
I try not.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.000
I don't try to call unless one, you need the calls, or two, I have something to call in

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.000
about.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:27.000
All right.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Well, what does it happen to be tonight?

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
One or two?

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Two, actually.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
All right.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000
What do you have to talk about tonight?

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
I want to talk about the next gen.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Yes, please.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000
A lot of people talk about that tonight.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
I think the price point is even scaring me.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.000
I liked what they were... Well, I was going to say, a lot of the things I liked when I

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:48.000
saw... I was watching the coverage as it came out, and I liked the little bit that

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:55.000
I saw, and the fact that I could actually have a handheld that plays quality games of

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:00.000
that of the PS3 would be absolutely amazing, but the price point, the fact that I know

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:04.000
it's going to come out, it's going to be like, oh, it's $799 or $800.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000
So that's what's going to scare me more than anything.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.000
That one will be like, okay, I'm going to have to put that in the back burner for like

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:14.000
three years before getting in and trying to catch up with everybody else, so...

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.000
It will never sell if it's over $500.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Sorry, I just... This is the perfect time for us to kind of take a step back.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Let's hop in the time machine and go back to five years ago, 2006.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000
You ready?

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Back in 2006, it was the Sony E3 press conference.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.000
You ready?

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Here you go.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Ridge Racer.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:45.000
The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change, and the consumers are ready.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Genji 2 is an action game which is based on Japanese history.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Ridge Racer.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.000
which actually took place in ancient Japan.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000
So here's this giant enemy crab.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Ridge Racer.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.000
And you attack its weak point for massive damage.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
It's Ridge Racer.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Ridge Racer.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.000
PlayStation 3 will retail for $599.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
$599.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
$599.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Giant enemy crab.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000
$599.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.000
$599.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
$599.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
It's Ridge Racer.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Ridge Racer.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Can't wait for E3 this year.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Sony always brings the lols.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:42.000
By the way, that's one of my favorite YouTubes ever.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Ridge Racer.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:47.000
That's one of my favorite YouTubes on the entirety of YouTube.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:50.000
It's the Sony press conference in one minute.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.000
For the love of God, make a new Ridge Racer game.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Ridge Racer.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Let's see here. Ridge Racer for the Xbox was the same as Ridge Racer 7.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Was the same as Ridge Racer on the PSP.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Was the same as Ridge Racer on, well actually the PSP version was like 4.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:17.000
But the 3DS version is basically the same as Ridge Racer 7 and Ridge Racer 6.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.000
All they're doing, they're not even putting any new effort into it.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:24.000
It's like, eh, let's put the game over.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
New cars, eh, let's port the game over.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.000
X-ominor think that'll cost 599 US Crabs.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Alright.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Those are historically accurate crabs.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Alright, I'm sorry X-Link. We're getting away from what you wanted to talk about.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Did he, X-Link?

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
No, no, it's quite alright. I'm not gonna keep it too long.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:46.000
It sounds like our connections seem pretty bad here, so.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Uh, well so, so-

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.000
But no, I just wanted to say that though, because you know, a lot of people, you know, like, I'm in between jobs right now.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I don't have 599 dollars to spend.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:01.000
I don't, I do have a job and I don't have 599 US dollars to spend.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Uh, I'm a little freaked out with the price.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.000
This thing better blow me if it's gonna be that much money.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
I better just do more than that. My god.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:18.000
This thing better come with a love gun or something, I don't know.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Alright. If they do, if they port gal gun-

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Start talking to you sexually?

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.000
To the NGP. Yeah, I wanted to talk dirty to me for 599 US dollars.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.000
I know, Rob.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:32.000
If there's a gal gun on the NGP, then I might be able to be talked into it. I don't know.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Well, you know, this is gonna be a fun year nonetheless for E3.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:44.000
And it's gonna be a lot of fun because this is gonna be probably the year of let's see who wound up who and what category and what area.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:47.000
So, yeah, this is gonna be a lot of fun, I have to say.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000
He's shooting his love pheromones into that plant's mouth.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
I can't, alright.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.000
XLink, I'm sorry, they're still fascinated with gal guns, so I gotta let you go.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
But have a good night, and thanks for calling.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Appreciate it.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Yeah, no problem.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Later.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Yes, you too. Okay, bye bye.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Oh my god, poor Inksfall on her from Ragnarok.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:11.000
It's gal gun! Gal gun!

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Ah, now everybody in chat's just being dirty.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Ah, you're all being dirty. SSJ100Matt says, Fleshlight attachment coming in June 2012.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Well, since you all are being dirty, let me bring this up.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Have you all heard of that show My Strange Obsession that's on TLC, the network that brings you hoarders and intervention and all that?

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.000
If it's got midgets or multiple kids, it's on our network.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:41.000
TLC now has the show My Strange Obsession where they like to show things like there was the chick that ate couch material.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Yes, I remember that.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000
She ate the foam inside couches. A chick that slept with her blow dryer.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.000
I saw that.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Well, this week, or maybe it was this last week, I don't know, they are going to have a guy who is infatuated with his real doll.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000
His love doll.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Good lord.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:00.000
That believes he is married to it or something like that. I don't know what the deal was.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:05.000
It was something like he treats the doll like it's a real person and sleeps with it at night.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Wasn't that a movie?

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
More than one way.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:11.000
This is real life, apparently. This is not like Weekend at Bernie's. This is the real deal.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000
No, it wasn't. They had a member of us with... I don't remember the guy's name.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Nah, I think I know what you're talking about. Was that Simone? About the virtual chick that comes to life?

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:21.000
No, no, no, no.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
De Niro was in that, but that movie went straight to video.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Oh.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:29.000
No, there was a movie about this guy who had a love doll or something like that.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:35.000
And it was like him and the whole town kind of pretended it was real.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
For no reason. I don't know.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.000
That sounds like a dumbass movie.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:42.000
It was one of those fucking artsy films. I don't know what it is.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:46.000
It was one of those things where I was like, really? I'm not gonna go see that.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Something the wife made you watch?

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Oh, I forgot to mention! Oh my god.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Gaming Week. Totally forgot.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:01.000
This week we had this kind of a kickoff for the 2011 year type thing.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:07.000
They had people from different branches out and stuff and they were doing these team building events and stuff like that.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.000
From Salacious Pop, Lance and the Real Girl.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Yes, that's it. Thank you.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Anyways, because I'm too lazy to look that up.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:24.000
So they had a bunch of Connect Adventure games that we were competing in teams for high scores and we win stuff.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:32.000
And I'd like to say that two out of the three days we kicked the crap out of everybody.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:40.000
The third day, or actually I should say the first day, we would have won had we played together, both myself and my co-worker.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Instead we were on separate teams with other people, which is why we lost.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:49.000
We won like $80 worth of movie passes.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Nice! What movie are you taking me to?

02:21:53.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Well, we don't go to see movies very often, so when we do go we're gonna get popcorn, hot dogs...

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000
$80 plus your kids.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
$60 in bulk candy.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:08.000
It's just a matter of time before your kids are gonna wanna go see every Disney movie, so you know.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
I mean, maybe a couple years, but still.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Yeah, a couple years.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
I just thought it was funny that we kicked the crap out of them.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Well, yeah, you're the video game team. You're supposed to kick the crap out of them.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Yeah.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Alright.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:20.000
It was awesome.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Well, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Thank you guys who got through.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:25.000
If you didn't get through, you can always email us.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:30.000
But we're gonna go ahead and start to wrap up the show tonight.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:34.000
It's a little early, but I guess it wasn't outside of the NGP.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Not a whole lot to say.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
We can just have an extra long after birth.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Uh, Darth Saker, your final thought tonight?

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Uh...

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Alright.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.000
And by the way, the chat room is yelling. It's actually Lars and the real girl, not Lance.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:53.000
And Salacious Pop says, it's actually really good, thank you very much.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I heard it was actually good.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Thank you very much.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:56.000
It just looked dumb.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000
You know, sorry.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
I don't know.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Alright.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000
My final thought tonight is, it's like I'm walking on sunshine.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:17.000
My final thought is, I never would have thought that Pandora would introduce me to a bunch of awesome music that I never would have heard of, thanks to Pandora.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Although it also introduced me to a lot of crappy music and music that I've heard of, you know, numerous times.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:31.000
But, you know, it's a little difficult to hit, you know, the thumbs up and thumbs down while driving my car.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Good point.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Alright, well thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:40.000
If you've enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask you guys, tell a couple people about our show.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Word of mouth is how we spread the word.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
That's how we've been doing it for the past nine years.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:50.000
We're not able to advertise in video game magazines or have E3 booths or, you know, have any of that.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000
We don't have a full-fledged team bringing news to you.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:54.000
This isn't our day jobs.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.000
We work very hard with balancing our family lives and all that stuff in this show.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000
And that's all we ask.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:00.000
It's not a pity story.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:01.000
It's just all we ask.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Help us spread the word about our little show.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
And that's all we really want.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Leave us nice reviews on iTunes.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:07.000
All that fun stuff.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:10.000
And if you didn't like our show, fine.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Don't listen to it ever again.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
But support other indie podcasters.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
They do a lot of hard work.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Especially, of course, you know, we're a little partial to the folks at AllGames.com and the varieties of shows that are there.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:24.000
But even if you're like, I hate every single show on AllGames, fine.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.000
You're a real picky bitch.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.000
But there's got to be something in the indie universe that's for you.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
So support independent podcasting.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Thank you very much, guys.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Have a wonderful week.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.000
We will see you back here next week for episode number 400 OMG.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Until then, good night.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:41.000
