With your hosts
Dark Sakura
Sky and Loki
Tonight, January 2nd, 2011
A popular SoCal arcade prepares to shut its doors
A hype Japanese release underperforms
And a classic Super Nintendo RPG makes its way to mobile phones
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello, my friends out there on the internet
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that show where every gamer has a voice
Over the next few hours, we'll be talking to you about video games
And gaming culture, gaming lifestyle, all that fun stuff
A new year here at Orange Lounge Radio
Our ninth year, if you can believe it, of broadcasting
From 2002 to 2011
My name is Rob Roberts
And with me, as always, as she has been for nine damn years
Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers
I hate that damn dragon
We're gonna get to that in a minute because everything, like, changed
It's like, it's like a new, is it technically a new decade now that it's 2011?
Yes
Okay, so like, new decade, everything changed
Seriously, I'm gonna get to that in a minute
Nothing's changed, I brought this
Tech master Loki over there, interjecting his opinion, yes
Yes, Tech Master Loki?
Yes, I brought soup a few weeks ago
Remember, I had two large soups, I'm like, look, I have two soups
But tonight you brought four soups
Well, it wasn't intentional, I only wanted two
Instead of two large soups, he has four smaller soups
Which I think is still more soup than the, you know, it was before
Alright, and that's value
Now, I do have to introduce, always with us, the fourth guest on the show
Officially is our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
Or we are on the IRC network on Game Surge
If you find that, gamesurge.net
And we are in channel Orange Lounge
If you want to do that, the real easy way, just go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com
But we do sometimes have guests in studio with us
Just to hang out and have some fun with us
Say hello to Gary is back tonight
Happy New Year
How are you doing, Gary?
I'm doing alright
You haven't been here in a few months
I seem to remember the last time you were here
Loki was out, so you were kind of a fill-in hosty type deal
Yeah, something like that
You're back tonight to kick off the new year with us here at OLR
We were off for the holiday break and all the December events that were going on
DarkSakura loaded her car and went up to Washington
How was your Washington trip, by the way?
That fun, huh?
It was alright, it was very...
I watched a lot of the DIY network
And Chiller, because they had a Buffy marathon
Doesn't Chiller also run the Twin Peaks episodes?
I have no idea, because I don't have cable
When did you watch on DIY?
House Movers, that was pretty cool
And I watched a lot of the home repair ones
I learned the quick way to add in drywall
Here comes Dan the man, the husband of DarkSakura, always present here
Am I on here?
Yes, you're on
Before you listen to her bitch about it, she also got to drink ridiculously expensive wine
I did
And she got completely smashed with my dad, which was hilarious
Your dad kept pouring me the wine
And you kept drinking it
And so did he
Anyway
And then he got an inversion table, so I'm drunk and upside down
It was kinkier than it sounds, with my dad
Shut up!
You are a bastard
Indeed
He was a smooth pimp
So before you let her go, oh, it sucked and I was bored
I didn't say it sucked
She had a good time
She got to sleep the whole way there in the back
I saw her vlogs, they were entertaining
DarkSakura is a vlogger now, with her little phones-y
And disturbing
And then Dan sitting there in the background like, hey, I'm Dan
I talked more on a couple that we didn't upload
Oh, bummer
Okay, well, I'm out of here
Alright, take care, Dan
So yeah, we do occasionally talk about video games here on Orange Laundry Radio
Video games, what the fuck?
Since it is a new year, let me just kind of reset the stage for everybody
If we happen to have any new listeners
So we're hitting the reset button real quick
Tell you a little bit about Orange Laundry Radio
Orange Laundry Radio started in 2002
I have a college radio background and DarkSakura and I used to do stuff with another show called
Undersedation Live, which is still up and running on the All Games Network on Saturday nights
But we decided to start a show that was kind of talking smack about video games
And what I mean by that is that DarkSakura, myself, and Loki
We actually all met at a arcade locally here
Playing, believe it or not, Dance Dance Revolution
We used to be obsessed with that game
I was never skinnier
Oh, no, no, no, Rob, Rob
For us, it was Parapara
A little bit of that, too, and Beatmania
And a lot of those music-based video games
So for a very long time, before there was even podcasting
We had a show on Live 365 dedicated to music games
And the music from them and so forth
So things have evolved, podcasting happened
And, you know, music games kind of faded out
Then they came back in a different way
And now they're kind of going, you know, things go up and down
And kamami said no one would like them
Yeah, so anyway, we're here
Silly, silly people
We're talking about kind of the rest of the video games
Of course, we still have a fondness for music video games
But we talk about role-playing games
Meat
Even first-person shooters
And meat
We might get to tonight
And of course
Meat
Food games
Iron Chef, for we
I'm going to make a sandwich in a moment
And I'm going to make a turkey and cranberry sandwich
And it's going to be amazing
The secret ingredient, Iron Chef, the game is suck
All right, anyhow
So that's our little show
So welcome, thanks for joining us
And of course, we do plug ourselves as the show
Where every gamer has a voice
And we do mean that, you know, this show was started with a bunch of us
Kind of sitting around after a night at the arcade
We used to go to this little restaurant called Brookfield's
That was in the parking lot of the arcade where we all played at
And we would have
Old people food
Well, but awesome mozzarella sticks
So we'd always kind of dine on mozzarella sticks
And talk smack about the games we just played
So that's kind of what we try to emulate here
Via our chat room, via the Skype line, via Twitter, via email
Via Carrier Pigeon, if you can figure out how to get one here
Rick's Glass of Merlot
All right, anyhow
Let's talk about games and your gaming week
We were off last week because of Decemberween or whatever
Yeah, Decemberween
Whatever it is you celebrate
Festivus, Christmas, Kwanzaa, all of it
All of it was an excuse to have last week off
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
Well, I played a lot
Actually, I played a lot of Mushihime Sama Bug Panic
Thank you so much, Loki
That game is so freaking fun
And seriously, it's like mix of cave shooter and an adventure game
And it's bullet hell on feet
It's fun, it's super fun
And so I played a ton of that
And I feel dirty
I feel dirty, Rob
Why? Why do you feel dirty?
Wow
DarkSakura started playing World of Warcraft
Oh my god, you guys
It's like a total turnaround from her stance two weeks ago
And I gained 30 levels in four days
Okay, so before everybody starts yelling at you
Scab defector, you suck
What is it, what's the magic that's there now that wasn't there for you last time?
More to do
Shut up
You get the hell out
You get the hell out
You are not on, no, no
I'd like to give an F you to Rob
For the whole fucking Warcraft thing
I'm not having it in my house
She can play for a while
Then she's gonna get all addicted
And I'm gonna get a fucking divorce
It's your fault, Rob
It's not my fault
I'm gonna kill you
Tiara plays too, blame her
I don't like Tiara, oh I like her
You can get the hell out
Should we call the police right now?
There's about to be a domestic disturbance
At least it's all captured
Here on the radio
Dan was in here doing the happy dance
While I blithely flipped him off
Alright
It was funny
It has more to do now, I guess
Keep in mind, I love Star Trek Online
I freaking love it
But I was running out of stuff to do
I was seriously getting bored
And they'd put in episodes
And I would just wait and do
All of the portions of the episode
At once, and then I would be done with it
And I'm like, okay, what do I do now?
And even some of the missions are now broken
And as much fun as I was having
I was like, I'm kinda done
What more can I do?
So I thought that the changes were really exciting
But really all I ever do is go in there
Talk to my friends and play Dabo
That's it
So I was like, you know
The door of opportunity swung open
So I gave it a try
Even after I was damn determined to play this game
Because it did not want me to
I defied
Every power
That tried to prevent me from playing this game
Meaning?
Meaning that my stupid
The loader.exe was reading
Badly with Windows
So I had to rename it Bob
And then it worked
No seriously, I tried every freaking thing
I ran safe mode with networking
I did all of this crap
And finally I'm like, fuck you, I'm naming you Bob
And it worked
Wasn't there a program back in the day called Microsoft Bob?
I have no idea
Isn't that like the reason we have Comic Sans in the world now?
Ooh, yeah
By the way, I've gotta go to our chat room
You know they are the always present guests here on the show
They're not allowed to talk
Black Wolf, addict
Act Deft, sell out
Bojigawa, addict
Jesus, let's just pop in our chat room
I was fine with my spouse's
Sleeping pill and QVC addiction
But I will not abide World of Warcraft in this marriage
Wow
Well I think, is he trying to say that you're addicted
Alan Hart
Is he trying to say that you're addicted to sleeping pills and QVC?
I am not
Dan admitted to me earlier today
That he used to stay up late
In his high school years
Watching the Home Shopping Network
What other good shit about
I was in fifth grade
And I stayed up all night watching Home Shopping Network
Because I was up late
And it made me feel like somebody was up with me
So I wouldn't be lonely
Pathetic, huh?
And it's hilarious because they're so stupid
I love watching them sell a computer
You press this button
And it does stuff
It comes with a free printer
Didn't know your show was going to be a confessional tonight
I know, it's like
We're cleaning the slate for New Years
It's a confessional tonight on Orange Lounge Radio
Get everything off your chest
So that this new decade
Can be a relieving one
Amen to that
But, well I am going to say
That I have now made it from
One side of the continent
To the other
On whatever freaking continent that is that you took me to
Actually, first of all
You took me to this giant tree
And then I jumped off, died
And then respawned at the bottom of the tree
So that I wouldn't have to figure out how to get off of it
And then just ran across the water
And then I've been
Running all over the continent
And it's been kind of fun because I've actually kind of
Been getting into the story
And getting into the lore of the game
It's been, now that I'm actually
Getting to see more of the story
Because that was one of the big things that I liked about Star Trek Online
As I was going through
All of the ranks and stuff
You get more of the story and I was like
Well it's really fitting in well with Star Trek Universe
And then I just got to this point like
What? Why are we fighting the Davidians?
They were the lamest
Brain sucking
Interdimensional creatures ever
It really
Except that they gave me the cool Silent Hill thing
So that was cool but
I accidentally ran into an instance and got killed
That has to happen at least once I think
It was the one that was underwater
Like with all the underwater people
Sounds like Black Fathom depths
That was it
That was it
Oh it's sad I know that
And now I'm in some place called the Battle Scar
And I couldn't find the damn flag
And then I just gained a level
Congrats, so what level are you now?
I know you're gonna do it
37
In a row?
But I think I've done okay
For myself because I've gotten there
In technically
Six days of playing
Right?
You've been jamming right along
Bochi Kawa in our chatroom says
Everyone jumps off of Teladrasil, it's normal
Is it like the Golden Gate?
Lumi's in our chatroom says
I hope we have another
I Slept with a Forum Troll reveal
I don't know
Gary, have you ever slept with a forum troll?
No
Well we had a guest a couple weeks ago that
Apparently had so
The only thing that forum trolls
Are fit for is machine gun targets
Alright
Seriously though
But I got a melodica
Which has nothing to do with games but I love Marisa forever
Would you learn how to play Still Alive on the melodica
And play it for us one night?
Wow that was random
I could probably figure it out over the course of the show
That's okay we don't need to hear you rehearsing
Throughout the next three hours
If you have nothing else gaming to report
No I did other stuff
I remember so fucking
We've had a bunch of maim going on in the front room all day
I heard they were playing Moonwalker when we got here
Because all I could hear was
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
No no wait I had to go
Ouch
And yeah
They've had the maim fest going on
And Dan has a new steering wheel
For Gran Turismo 5
I'm never gonna call
Wow Player an addict again
I'm gonna call Dan an addict
It's a Bobby Blackpool
Joke
Bobby is convinced that Gran Turismo 5 is not out
Because he's not seen it on a store shelf anywhere
But your husband somehow has it
You know what I can verify that it is out
Because sometimes I hear Dan yelling at it
That though
And the biggest thing that I'm gonna give it
Is that it has the top gear track
And it has the Stig
So it's instantly
In my cool book forever
Because I freaking love the Stig
He listens to all kinds of interesting music
And he may or may not be an alien
Okay
Let's go to Loki
Loki how was your gaming week?
It was okay
I didn't play a whole lot
Just playing the same stuff
I've been working on Grand Theft Auto stuff
Just doing construction stuff
With the mods
Then also of course
I've been playing some
iPod games
Including
Some of these aren't exactly new
Actually most of these aren't new
But they're very similar types of games
Cannibalt and I Must Run
Both actually pretty much similar to Cannibalt
Based off the Flash game
Where you run and have to jump over pits
And stuff like that without dying
And keeps getting faster and faster
I Must Run they try to add kind of a story to it
And it's kind of neat
And I like the presentation of it
It's like some time traveling game
That sort of reminds me of the art style
Of like Feel the Magic
So that's kind of cool
And then
Also played
More Swords and Poker 2
Which unfortunately is not on
The app store anymore
The first one, Swords and Poker 1
But thankfully though
I have a jailbroken iPod
So I don't have that problem
And I'm glad
Because those games are very addicting
And then also
I don't know if you noticed
But there was
Some new stuff actually coming on
The app store
It was pretty cool
They had one of the
Tails games actually
Is now on the app store
So if you're a fan of that series
You might want to check that out
It was a Super NES Tails game
It was
Let's see here
Which Tails game was it?
Tails
I guess
Tails of Weaver
Lucian Cult
But I guess it's based on the MMORPG
But it looks like
A nice 16-bit RPG
You know
I will say even though you've been kind of slowly
Going this way over the past six months
Maybe the biggest change for 2011 isn't the fact
That Loki is not bringing bacon
Pizza to the show but the fact that
I would have never said two years ago
That Loki would be the one here reviewing games that are out on the
iTouch
Call me crazy but if you've listened to Loki's
Diatribes in the past on Apple
I've already told you though
I understand
It's still a little bizarre
It's max not the i things
See the i things
They are expensive but they're good
And the max
The max are fucking expensive
They're not good
You don't get very good value for what you
Purchase
I would hope that if I'm spending $2,000
On a laptop that I'm getting something
More than just one USB drive
I don't care if it's paper thin
I want a fucking computer that can do something
That's just my opinion
But hey you know what
Teach their own and some people will buy
Max stuff forever and honestly
I spent no money on this
I had a stupid gift card that they gave me
It was either that or
Buying a bunch of Apple TV's
That throw out a window or something
I will say that max are still
Great for the graphics but now
That Adobe's figured out that
There's really a lot of PC users out there
I have no need
To have a Mac anymore
They have pretty monitors
But those monitors have their old
God I want one of those gorgeous
Gigantor monitors
Oh my god that would be so amazing
I would need new underwear every day
They're pretty nice
Our graphics department has
Some of those and they're nice
But once again it's a monitor
And I'm sure that monitor is way overpriced
For what it is
So I just
I could buy a TV and hook it up
And it would cost less than the monitor
See like I have my
iPod which I can browse the web
And stuff if I have a wifi spot
And I have my phone which you know I can
Browse the web too with that but honestly
I hate my phone's web browser
It's terrible and it's
Slow
I have an Android phone
But it's
It's a virgin mobile prepaid
Android phone
I don't think it's like a super android
Android that plays snake
Yes
But it is an
Android that I was able to root and
Add a thing to
Allow me to tether
To it so I just tether this
To it and I'm able to browse the web
And I love it and it's great
And I use this actually a lot now
To you know browse the web and check
My mail or whatever instead of
Having to go to my computer boot it up and do
All that stuff and then just it's a lot
Quicker I just do it on here
But see that's the only thing I have I like going for
It cause I mean this is
Arguably the top
There's no I mean Zune's
They're alright but there's no
Yes but there's no like
You know there's not really
Any iPod
Competitors out there that are kind of close to it right now
Can't say the same though for Max
Max I'm sorry it's just there's
There's competitors everywhere and they're just beating the
Crap out of them
Other computers are you know they've
Gotten the form factor really small but
I'm sorry it's just
That's not important to me
So Loki would you say
The description of a Mac is an overpriced fashion
Accessory true or false
Or something else
They buy into the brand and not
Necessarily it's for people
They've
Kind of marketed them as PCs
They're easy to use or laptops
They're easy to use and it's they're kind of
People don't want to try to
Learn stuff and they trust the
Apple brand because it's been around forever
And unfortunately people are willing
To spend a lot of money for that
This is the impression I get and I'm probably going to piss some
Mac fans off but you know oh well
I had an Apple
Laptop it only lasted me a year but
I had it but anyway
I kind of get the sense that
Apple a lot of their systems
Why I don't know why we've turned into this Mac versus PC
War but
Really preference I mean if you want to buy one
Go ahead but Macs are kind of like PC
Consoles to me and I think sometimes that's the
Advantage of them is that a lot of the software is
Very much customized for the Mac
Because their library is
A little more limited than what you see on the PC
And the expandability and
Customizability well yes I understand you can do some
Of it with Apple they're not all over the
Fucking map like PCs are like
There's zillions and zillions of
Different types of PCs but there's only so many types
Of Macs and I think the software
By nature kind of is
A little more optimized and runs a little better
On Macs the app store coming to the Mac
Is a great idea because
You know at least then you have a lot of
Different programs and tools and stuff that people
Can just fill
Their computer with like I have with my
iPod so
I think that's a good idea and they'll really fit with it
But once again it's basically just
Like hey look it's just a more expensive
iPad or something now it's a computer
iPad you know
I don't know it's just but iPads
Are so cute last time I used
Anything from Apple it crashed on me
I don't know
Alright well let's get let's get off the Apple
PC stuff and continue with our gaming
Weeks I don't know if Loki has anything else
But if no just grant them though but I don't we
Don't need well what else is new let's go over to
Gary what types of video games you've been
Playing lately
Well Dark Sakura's husband's been
Kicking my ass thoroughly on Street Fighter
For Super Turbo
Yes well
That goes without saying I just started
Playing it thank you I just said that
I can't that he can't help that he's
Not good at it that's because I haven't played it
Since I was in junior high thank you
And I've
Also yeah yeah yeah
I also just started playing Batman Arkham
Asylum finally
Which the graphics are wow
And yeah
I know I'm trying to come lately to that party but
It's still something I haven't
Attached the game oh okay
Well I feel a little bit better but still
It's a fun
Game I'm told that you can beat it in about
Eight hours if you if you're dedicated but
I'll drag it out and enjoy it
As long as I can so
But yeah I
Recently acquired an Xbox 360
So and that's been
That's been a lot of fun
And I'm quite impressed I also got a
A Samsung
Phone with windows on
It and I noticed it has the Xbox Live
Application
I have yet to go through the catalog
And see what games are available to download
I think I saw Tetris as one of them
That's been a big thing they're pushing lately is that the
Whole achievements from your phone and all that
Pretty good
You know what's kind of cool and I kind of
Off subject here real quick but we were talking about
Oh I was talking about my phone
One thing I like and this is something
That I wish that they would do with like
Steam and stuff is the Android
Marketplace say you buy an
App or something like from them and it either
Sucks or it doesn't work
You can get your money back
And uninstall
Nice yes I mean
That's awesome
They should really have that
I haven't paid for any apps on this
On the windows phone yet the only ones I've got
I've downloaded were free so
But you know we'll see what happens
With that I like it so far
But
Time will tell the battery doesn't last
For anything but I'm told that's normal
Yeah with a lot of smart phones
They don't always last very long
My iPhone lasts forever
Well the more you're online the more you do
The GPS enabled stuff
Of course that's all going to be a battery drain
So you just want to make sure you're not running anything in the background
We were running the MP3 players
From here to Washington and didn't lose
And didn't use up the whole battery
Surprisingly enough MP3 really doesn't use that much battery
And I was
Using and Facebooking the entire way too
It only uses up a lot of battery
If you continuously skip through songs
I've noticed if you just let it play
Yeah it'll go forever
So
Well anything else for your gaming week you wish to share with us Gary?
Oh just
A lot of tabletop D&D
Ah that's right
You're into the old school types of games
Not really old school
But I like me some Final Fantasy 2
And I've got a hold of Final Fantasy 13
And haven't had a chance to start it yet
Because I'm still one thing at a time
And for the tabletop fans out there
Because I know there's always a few
There's always a little bit of crossover between the video gaming circles and tabletop gaming circles
What are your tabletop games of choice right now?
Um
I was playing
I've been playing D&D since 2000
So I'm kind of getting burnt out on fantasy
I'm looking at Hero System
I'm looking at Mutants and Masterminds
From Green Ronin
Which just recently released
A DC Heroes
Roleplaying game based on the Mutants and Masterminds system
Last fall
And they're going to put out the third edition of Mutants and Masterminds
Very very shortly
I haven't only gotten to play it once or twice
But I'm told by people who have played it
It's an awesome system
I have a little bit more experience with Hero
Which is a lot more complicated
Alright
Speaking of DC there's a big new game coming out soon
The DC Universe Online is out in about
One, two weeks
From that it looks awesome
Yeah I've played the beta on the PC
It's good times
It's a little bit like if Ninja Turtles was an MMO
Because it is a lot of beat-em-up
It does come with a month of free play
Well that's customary, of course
So we'll see
I'll have to look into that one
Alright
Well anyway, my gaming week
I want to talk about a few things with my gaming week
I'm kind of like Gary
I was kicking it old school a little bit
I wanted to buy two used games and get one free
One of them isn't old
I bought Tron Evolution
Which is the game that came out
To support the new Tron movie, Tron Legacy
I bought that on the Playstation 3
And I played this at E3 and I was somewhat
Encouraged by what I saw
With the whole Prince of Persia style fighting
And you know
I was seeing the light bike races
On another screen, although that ended up really being
The Wii version
So I played the Tron game
And it sucks, I hate it
I'm really disappointed because
Tron deserves a better game than this
And I'm sorry to say it
It was clearly
Clearly rushed to make
The movie release
And this shit always happens with games based on movies
And that's why none of them are ever any good
I should say, rarely are they good
And unfortunately it just falls in that same bin
Where the best part about it was the
Daft Punk soundtrack in the beginning
It's hard to hear that
Because it deserves better
And there's so much more they could do with the Tron mythos
I will say this, the story
Is kind of the coolest part
And what I liked is that some of it
Would parallel scenes in the movie
And without giving it all away
Because I don't want to tell you about the whole plot
But I will say it's supposed to
Explain what happened between the first movie
And the new movie
And the new movie does some of that flashback as well
So there is overlap
With the flashback scene which you see in the movie
And what you play in the game
Honestly, I think I'm just going to go on YouTube
And try to find a compilation of all the cut scenes from the game
There will be more Tron games
It's inevitable
I wish they'd be better
This is what ruined the game for me
What absolutely ruined the game for me
Was in one sequence
I finally got through the first level
And I got to the sequence where you're on light bikes
And I was like, fuck yes!
I get to do the light bike races
Because that was one of the coolest fucking things in the movie
I'm doing spirals and up the hills
Yeah, you know
And I'm doing the light bikes and they control
Like, butt
And I crashed my light cycle
I shit you not, like seven times
And the whole acceleration, deceleration
Doesn't really flow
And there's this part where you are supposed to do this big jump
But if you haven't accelerated enough
You don't make the jump
I'm literally sitting there going
Did anybody play this game
To see if it was fun
Because it's not fun
And that is so frustrating
Because it's Tron
It's fucking Tron
And it deserves to be so much better
I was so mad
I will tell you this
Do not, do not spend $60 on this game
Do spend 99 cents on the iPhone game
That's out there because it's a better experience
Dude, I have that, it's great
That was the other thing that I was trying to remember when I played
That game is fun
But you did see the movie, right?
I fucking love the movie
Well you know that they're doing it twice
They're doing like a Clone Wars thing with it
Where they're going to have an animated series
That's going to be between the first and second movies
Yeah, that sounds interesting
You should totally read the comics by the way
The Tron, the betrayal
They're really good
I wonder if there's any overlap with that in the game as well
But let me tell you, here's some of my problems with the game you guys
Because you know, I'm sitting here when it stinks
The thing is that
A lot of the combat feels like really repetitive
And there's some frame rate issues
When like, you know, you're throwing the disc
It just kind of seems to like
Bounce all over the screen in random frames
The multiplayer
Like, what would you think multiplayer would be in Tron?
What would you think would be the first thing
You're going to go into in a multiplayer in Tron?
Anybody?
Don't you think? No
Nope, it's a battle arena
It's not the disc thing, it's just 20 people
In a big clusterfuck arena
All de-rezzing each other
There were no light cycles up front
Not that I could find easily
I could have sworn I read it's like in there
But I was like cycling, I don't know if it's something you have to buy
Later on or what
But I was cycling through the stuff
I didn't find that mode to play
So either I'm a complete moron or the game was not well designed
Because I could not find it
Because I'm thinking, if you're trying to sell a game to Tron fans
You would put that light cycle, the tanks
All that shit would be front and center
You know what I mean? And it's not
I went into this ultra lame
20 people all throwing discs at each other
Or the light jets
That would have been cool
Or the little mosquito looking guys in the movie
It was awesome
Wyland in our chatroom says
Play a real Tron game, play 2.0
You know what? I've heard a lot of good things
About that game and I probably should
You're probably right
I was going to ask you about that
Were there any other Tron games that came out before the movie?
Besides 2.0?
Just Tron 2.0
That I know of
And that's not counting any fan stuff
Because the Tron sequel has been in development
For quite some time
From what I understand
So there's been an absence of Tron things
I mean not counting
Xbox Live Marketplace
Had rehashes of the Tron
I don't think you can get them anymore
Because of license issues
If you don't count that
This is where it gets awesome
Tron deadly discs
And Wyland just wants to say
Yeah 2.0 is far far better
Than evolution
And Tigerclaw says Sky light cycles are in there
I think it's the RB button that puts you in light cycle mode
Well I mean I know light cycles
Were like in the game but is it multiplayer?
Because when I was like circling around the different arenas
It was all different types of
Melee
So whatever I mean
Call me an idiot if you want
But the fact that I couldn't find that very easy
I think speaks for itself
Yeah
Anyhow
Unfortunately if you must
Rent Tron for the story
Do not do not spend 50 or 60 dollars
Just go to the Tron wiki
I've already read the whole thing on the Tron wiki
Well I mean it's nice to see it
Like it's fun to see the movie
Rent it
It's at most worth a $5 rental
And you could probably play through it a weekend
Or
Most red boxes nowadays do have game rentals
As well you can rent it for one day
For like two bucks
There you go
From what you were saying that sounds like about all it's worth
So I'm gonna move up the scale
In games I played this week
So here's the next game I played
White Knight Chronicles came out in 08
It's like a level 5 game for the Playstation 3
What was it? Final Fantasy 11
The offline version almost
Well here's the thing
I'm not sure what the fuck this game is
Like and that's
The weird thing about it
Like I kind of feel like White Knight Chronicles
Is one of those games where
It has a bit of an identity crisis
Where they try to do so much with it
That they have a lot in the game
But it doesn't do any of it exceedingly well
And it's not that I dislike the game
It's been interesting to me enough
Where I've sank like 4 hours in it so far
But
I don't know
Let me kind of set the stage for you
It's kind of your typical like
You've been kidnapped and you gotta go find her
Type of thing
You create this character in the beginning of the game
And your character does nothing in the story
Your character literally stands there
Next to the main character
While everything is playing out
Which is really weird right?
So ok whatever
The main character and his little lackey
You go off on the adventures
And you know you're killing things
And the battle system is the closest thing I could compare it to
Is like Final Fantasy 12
Because you can kind of do like live attacks
And things and the coolest part was that you can create
Combos based on your class
And you can kind of like string these
Combos together that you've created
And so it's kind of cool
Like I like that
And you go out in the fields and you know
Fight some monsters just go from one place to the other
And all the monsters you see on the map
You start to get some frame rate issues
In some areas which are on the Playstation 3
Which is supposed to be this uber piece of technology
Is a little bit
But whatever you know you kind of look past that
And go forward
And then
After about a couple hours into the story it says
By the way there's this whole GeoNet thing
You can hook up online
And play with other people and get quests
And do this stuff together
And so I'm like oh maybe that's why your character
Has been a lackey this whole time
Because that's like really going to be your online character
Even though they had nothing to do with the single player mode
This character is going to be like
Your little online person
And I don't know
And then the game starts to feel like
Now I'm playing Phantasy Star Universe
There's all these quests
That you can kind of do and there's recommended levels
And you go out in the field
And do your goal like it really kind of felt like
Phantasy Star Universe
Where you play the single player for a little while
And then all of a sudden it's like oh hey it's a multiplayer game too
So it's really weird
I don't know how else to explain it
And sometimes the camera
Can kind of bug and sometimes
You know the battle system
Starts to feel a little bit like okay
Like could I gain my little powers
A little faster so I could do the cool stuff
More often because right now this feels very slow moving
So yeah White Knight Chronicles
A bit of an identity crisis
I didn't hate it
I don't love it
I like it but I have a really difficult time
Explaining to anybody
What the game is
So your rating in a nutshell is just what meh?
I think if you like
Japanese RPG type of games
And you like the more actiony
Based ones like you like Phantasy Star
Online
It's not press X to swing your sword
It's a little more active time battle than that
But if you kind of like
That sort of idea then I think you'd like it
And if you like your grind fest
I think it would be permissible
And especially now that you can find it most places
Like 30, 35 bucks
That's a fair price to pay
Considering it has a pretty robust online mode
It's a fee for
So I'll give it that
And I guess there's a sequel that came out in Japan
But I don't think it's coming out here
Because unfortunately I do not believe the game did too well
So there you go
Yeah so that was the
That was the weird thing
Then I played
Fallout 3
I was partying like it was 2008
But I finally got a hold of this game
On the used game sale
And yeah I think the people describing it
With guns, really good
Great story though
I was totally into it in the beginning
I think they do a great job kind of setting the stage
As you're doing that whole like baby
To child to adult
And all that
I don't want to spoil anything even though the game is like years old now
But you know it's kind of like
How you get to where you are in the story
And why you're in a nuclear wasteland
And all this stuff
And yeah the only unfortunate thing about it
Is that if you don't save often
The NPC you might have wanted to do a quest for
Will end up dead and now you can't do that quest
So uh
Save now, save often
That's really the only terrible thing I can think about it
Otherwise I gotta say
Another reason why I really like this game
Is that it's not just that it's like first person shooter
But you can use some of like your little power
By hitting the right bumper
To go into like this like
Focus attack mode
Where if I suck at first person shooters
At least if I'm like kind of like stealthy enough
At second person points
I can still shoot someone in the head with a very accurate shot
Because it basically stops the game
And you can focus on a part of the body
And it tells you the percentage
Yeah a little bit
Because it tells you like the percentage of success
So I thought that was kind of neat
So uh yeah
I like Fallout and it's a beautiful game
And there's so much to it
And if you have the game of the year edition
You just have quests upon quests upon quests
So uh yeah
My Fallout 3
Um let's see
Something else I want to talk about
I've had 11 days in a row off of work
Because at my work we take the entire time
Between Christmas and New Years off
It's like a PTO thing I won't get into details
That's what we do
So I've had 11 days to kind of you know play some games
And so forth
One day I decided you know what
I'm gonna watch The Tester season 2
I'm gonna just download every single episode
I'm gonna watch the whole damn thing
Yeah sure me
Has sure me's bowels been voided
Okay sure me's asleep so hopefully she won't hear me
Talking about this
I gotta admit something you guys
It was actually a pretty good show
Like it was better than the first season
What I watched of it
I think the show
Now here's the show if you haven't heard of it
You can only download the show
It's only available on PlayStation Network
And it's a show about people that are
Imagine it's The Apprentice
The Donald Trump Show you're fired
But it's with video games and the ultimate job is to become
The PlayStation Tester
Which is why this show is getting a lot of shit
Because what a glamorous job game testing is
Right?
But what I like about the show
What I ended up ultimately liking about it
Was that you know
It didn't really hide the fact
That none of these people
Really had the goal of being a PlayStation Tester
A lot of them said
Fully self aware
I want this job to get my foot in the door
So I can work with these people
To work my way up
And like this one girl
She even says in one episode
You know what? I don't even own a PlayStation 3
I want to make games for children
And you might kind of look at that and go
What? You don't even own a PlayStation 3? What the hell are you doing on this show?
But I kind of looked at that going
That's really kind of honest of Sony to have in there
Because if you think everybody that's working
In the video game industry right now
Grew up on video games
And I had a pickup call coming
And so I thought it was a very kind of like honest response
And another guy had said
You know what? I want to do this so I can get into PR
And yeah
So it seemed like everybody that was kind of on the show
Like actually really wanted to be there
And I have to admit
I can't remember the last time I saw a reality show
Where by the time it was down to the last episode
The final three people
Like I would have been happy with any single one of them winning
Ultimately the person that won
I thought was a
Person that was really going to use
Their potential and so forth
But I would have been happy if Sony really
Ended up hiring any of them
Because I thought they kind of told a good story
So when I say like
Oh my gosh you should drop everything you're doing and watch this show
No
I mean like really I should have been trying to catch up on
True Blood or some other show
I don't know why I was watching this
But if you're surfing around the channels
And you're watching reruns of Cops on G4
Or you're watching some of this other garbage that's on TV
Like honestly the tester
It's not that bad
You know it's not like
They are
It's interesting because
You're going to look at some of the like types of challenges
They do and so forth and like you're like
What does this have to do with game testing
Does it have anything to do with game testing
But it's TV
Look at The Apprentice
What does a lot of the crap they do on that show have to do with
Actually running a company
Not a lot but usually there's that one little
Tip in it
That is kind of the focus of the episode
And that's the same thing I mean this show is a complete rip off
Of The Apprentice in many ways
So yeah I
Really didn't hate it
In fact I kind of liked it
And I think I'll watch next season
Isn't that weird
Like we're supposed to hate this show right
I'm not smelling any gas from Shermy
And to me the second season
What the second season did better than the first season
Is I really felt like the people
That were just like
Didn't even want to be there or were just cast
Were like the very first person
That was off that show
I was like if this person laughs in the show
I'm gonna just swallow my own tongue
Or something it's just terrible
But the very first person they kicked off was the right person
It was somebody who didn't even need to be there
They did have someone that was on
That was kind of more of a drama causer than anything else
And not to really like spoil
What happens or anything
But ultimately like when his
Desserts comes up you kind of go
Oh yeah like if you're like ah
So I don't know if that was like a TV thing or what
But there you go
So looking at our chat
Room chat at chat.orangelaunge
Radio.com Bochi Kawa in our chat room
Says oh tester I thought that it was interesting
This run that jerk must have been a plant
I really don't think anyone would go that far
To be an asshole and would get anywhere near
Thinking he wants a job I think you're
Right I think he was one of those people that was cast
For drama I mean maybe he did want the job
But not as bad as
The people that ultimately make it to the
Final episode and that do end up
Ultimately getting the job so
Yeah there you go
Not as terrible as I would have thought I know I was
Surprised maybe you would be too who knows
So that's it that's it for my gaming week
Let's quickly do some housekeeping
You can
Join us on twitter at twitter.com
Slash o l r we'll be taking some tweets
Later on in the show of course and
We will be of course
Looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
And if you don't already have us
On facebook please consider adding us
Facebook.com slash orangeloungeradio
And with that we'll get into some
Gaming news tonight and Loki as always
Will start us off
Ah yes and this is kind of interesting
You know the Playstation
3 hacking news
It's kind of been going back and forth as far
Okay we found a crack and oh hey
We patched a crack and
So on and so forth but this
I don't know if they can be able to recover from
During the
Kind of hacker conference
Going on right now the chaos communications
Conference 27C3
Apparently the
Hackers responsible for the Wii's homebrew channel
Who I guess is the group called
Failoverflow gave a presentation
Which they've said they
Figured out the private key
Sony uses to authorize code
To run on retail PS3 systems
What that means is that
Hackers would have almost full control
Of the PS3 system without
The use of a USB device
Basically
It means they'd be able to sign their own code
And you'd be able to
Do a lot
Of things on there including you know
Their whole big thing is to run
Linux on PS3's whatever the
Firmware version is
Of course they're not really interested in
Piracy with this obviously people
Could adapt it to do that
But they're really kind of concerned
With just the applications of it and
Um
Some of the things that was kind of neat
About it is that they
Literally have almost access to all
The like cores and everything using this
Um
It's just kind of neat
Who saw this punchline coming a mile away
When the PlayStation 3 first did away with Linux
And see this is actually hard coded into
Each console
There's no way to patch this
They can't
Wow
I mean basically what they can do is
They create keys or whatever
These USB devices have keys on them
Assigned to them and what they've done
Like to prevent those
Jailbreak devices from working
Is they add blacklists for different keys
Well
The master key you can create your own keys
From it so
They block one you can just create another one
You know it's just impossible to
Stop it
So what happens now? Piracy runs rampant
Or what? Not necessarily I mean
Their whole big thing is they don't want to
They're not aiming towards piracy they just want to
Bring like homebrew
To the PS3
Linux is really what they're looking to
Do
Let's bring Linux back I guess
But don't you think this would have also been a conclusion
Anyway even if Sony hadn't done away with Linux
Do you think that maybe they were working on this
Anyway
I mean I guess
What do we know we're not in this little organization
Or whatever but
It's just interesting to me it's really interesting that
Sony kind of pulls the plug on the whole
Linux thing because they were worried about
People exploiting it for piracy really
At the end of the day and now it's like
Well we're just going to shove Linux
In this thing whether you like it or not
And if they can install Linux on a freaking toaster
They can install Linux on a
Hacker proof PS3
This is probably worse than the whole
Exploit through
Linux to begin with
Because a lot of people may not have had Linux
On their system or weren't even interested
In that but the fact that they
Took it away and people don't like
When things are taken away especially when they
Paid for them whether it's an advertised
Feature or not I don't care
Now to be fair
Just devil's advocate you don't have
To patch your PS3 to remove
The Linux you just won't be able to play
Any games in the past
That's removed from your system
That's basically it we can either
Say oh well you know
You could lose Linux and you get column A
Games made in 2010
Or you get column B Linux
You can't have both
So that's kind of lame
But it's going to be interesting
To see where this goes from here because
That's bad
SSJ100Matt in our chat room says
I don't know I still think people are going to
Use it to pirate games well of course they are
Of course there are people out there
That are going to do that and
I don't doubt that they're
Going to find ways to do that but
It's just that the
Aim of this group wasn't to
Just you know
Create some sort of way to pirate games
They're not interested in that
But other people are
Interested in that I'm really curious
To see what Sony's kind of
Response ends up being to this because you know
A lot of them are probably coming back from holiday
Tomorrow you know while I'm sure there's some
People working for Sony 365
Days a year there's probably a lot of people
Coming back tomorrow and it's going to be interesting to see what
Their kind of response is if they do try to
Patch it I know you say it's unpatchable
They try to do something I mean
They've got it they kind of owe it to their
Basically I mean they've got a lot
Of things even just after
This conference you know they have things being released
That group has already released
The development tools for
The stuff that they have so now they have
Different you know
Like
Early code and stuff to
Code to pack and unpack
Pup and package files to
Make and read
Selfs and
Other developer related stuff
So you know
Look forward to possibly
Custom firmwares what not
And they've already released the root key so
I mean
I don't know there's not much
More you can really do there it's just
Yeah
It's going to be tough there's
Not really any way that they're going to be able to get around this
Wow
Because if you think about it you can't change
The master key if you do
That then like
You know some of the consoles aren't going to
Work you just can't it's part of
The hardware
Alright well something else to look forward to
Hardware wise
Hardware wise in 2011
Is the psp2
Of course we've heard rumors and rumors about
It but more and more
Seems to come out every week and this has to do with a
New York Times interview that
Khaz Harai he's the of course Sony computer
Entertainment head talking
A little bit about the psp2 but not
Directly a lot of people are kind of inferring
Things about the psp2 because
Keep in mind Sony has not confirmed a psp2
It's just one of those duh
Of course they're working on a new hand held system
And we don't know if it's a phone
We don't know if it's a psp2
We don't know if it's both or one of each
We don't know that stuff yet but we do know
What Khaz Harai said to the New York Times and that was
Quote depending on the game there are ones
Which you can play perfectly well with a
Touch panel but you can definitely play
Immersive games better without physical buttons
And pads I think there could be games
Where you're able to use both in combination
Oh so suddenly he's kind of
Endorsing a little bit about touch things right
Hmm this must mean
That some of those rumors about the touch panels are true
Quote we don't want gamers to be asking
What's the difference between
A Playstation phone or a phone
And a psp we have to come up
With a message that users will understand
It would have to be a product that keeps
The Playstation's strengths intact
Again sort of
You know kind of
Not outright saying there's a Playstation
Phone but saying you know we're trying
To kind of you know
You have to do it right and of course
We're doing it right
Come on
Please
Well Consumer Electronics Show is this weekend if I'm not mistaken
Or this week
So you might see it there but
I mean if it's
I would say this if the phone
And the psp2 are
Separate I would say you'll see the phone
As CES you might see it as soon as CES
Possibly Game Developers Conference
Psp2 however
E3 I mean
Maybe Game Developers Conference but again
Game Developers Conference is not supposed to be the media event
That's E3
But Sony kind of seems
To use Game Developers Conference
Anyway to make big announcements
They talked about the move
They unveiled Playstation Home
It wouldn't be unheard of for them to drop
A little bombshell
Although I think the psp2 would just be so big of a bombshell
I think Game Developers
Conference is too early for it
Unless they just want to come out and say
Okay fine you figured it out
So here developers get to work
We'll see
Anyhow moving on with some other news
Sadness
Very very much sadness
About the psp2 I know
Arcade Infinity
Uh oh
It's gone
The inevitable has happened
It's closing on January 15th so we need to go
Take a trip to LA like now
Like tomorrow? Yeah
Good luck right
Basically Arcade Infinity
Was the big place that
Got a lot of RB money in the US
Not just that
But a lot of just import games in general
I played an Umjamilami
Arcade machine at Arcade Infinity
And the tambourine version of
Samba de Amigo
Which by the way is the gayest video game I've ever played in my life
Was that tambourine
To whatever
You shake around a tambourine like you're Stevie Nicks
It's crazy
Except without the big hobo
Stuff
Anyway I'm sorry I meant boho stuff
But yeah these are the places
That brought us Blaze Blue
And DJ Max Technica
And the Gundam game
Remember that awesome Gundam game?
And remember one day
That we were there
We sat and played like what 10 games of
Shock Troopers
Just because it was on free play
That was pretty fun
I've never played Typing of the Dead
And we're like
Oh my god it's in Japanese
We could get as far as the boss
That would ask you questions and you'd have to answer them
And then it would be like shit I don't know Japanese
I can't do it
But I mean man
I just have so many good memories
Of that place but now
It's gonna be
Closing
It's going away
I gotta be honest the last time I was there
I didn't have quite the wonder
That it had when I was there back in its
Hay day but I think that's
Sadly arcades in general
I really hate to say it but
Man the online stuff is really
It's really
Taking its toll I mean it's kind of obvious
Well you know the other thing that they were doing
There was
Selling import skylines
Like bringing
In cars from Japan
And trying to make them street legal
For sale in the U.S.
But yeah apparently Bimani
Style folks are having a
Gathering there for the last day
So
Our buddy DJ Tyrant
Who once in a while does some stories
Foragelongstreet.com he's gonna go and give us
A little report so since I can't be there
It'll be nice to have somebody there
Bring me back a token
I probably have a bunch still somewhere
I know I've got some somewhere but
That's just really sad cause I mean
Whenever we would go to LA we would always make it a point
That we were gonna go to Arcade Infinity
And then we'd go have dinner at that place
That you had to walk all the way freaking across
A you know football field sized parking lot
To go eat at
And then we'd go back and play more games and then
You know it's just it's sad
Yeah Very very sad
Well it's just sad in general that
Here's another great arcade closing its doors
And this is a trend we saw starting
Years ago with what Southern Hills Golf
Land Folsom Game Room
You know all these
Arcades just started closing and closing
And even the arcades that are still there
Which would be like Roseville Golf Land and some of the other
Golf lands that are out there
Are nothing but ticket redemption machines now
You know what I mean?
Shermie's trying to get out so she can go poop on the tester
Yep I figured as much
She's probably trying to get out No she's fine
She's sitting underneath your butt She doesn't poop in the corner
She's sitting underneath you
Shermie is equally sad
About the closure of Arcade Infinity
It is sad
Certainly back in the heyday that was the only place
I could play Keyboard Mania
Yeah
And I just remember playing the crap
Out of that Gundam game
Well somebody needs to take a 40
And pour it out in the parking lot
What are they doing to the rest of their candy cabs?
Unfortunately I only have good beer
So I'm not going to do that
Just go to BevMo and get one crappy beer
So you can
Ice cold, cold 45
Cold 45, dump it in the lot
Thank you
Please and take pictures of it
Take pictures of it
One for me and one for my homies
Rest in peace Arcade Infinity
Sorry to see you go
I wonder what they're doing with their cabinets
You opportunist
Probably the same thing that Tilt at the Metron is doing
You want to get a BeatMania machine for 300 bucks
I should check uh
Well I don't have a
Speaking of other arcades that have
Gone away
You get a Marvel vs Capcom for 300 bucks
Allen saw that and he said Christmas Rob! Christmas!
Christmas!
Poor Allen, poor
Alright anyway
Uh yeah
Well Nintendo was warning that you shouldn't have children
Under the age of 6
Playing the 3DS in 3D mode
Apparently it will make them go cross-eyed
Well that's not the reason
But it may hurt their vision
So
It's bad
So don't play it in 3D mode
Unless you want cross-eyed kids
Oh come on
Surely it can't be
That you play
This for 5 minutes and you're gonna go cross-eyed
You're talking about prolonged
Exposure
Is what this is
Nintendo's probably over-reacting
So there isn't a lawsuit
When at the end of the day this really comes down to
Parents, you really should watch how much
Of the games your 6 year old is playing
Exactly and that brings up a wonderful point
Is that you can use the included
Parental controls
That allow parents to lock the device
In 2D mode
So it's the 3DS 2DS
That's okay though
As much as I think the 3D thing is kinda cool
Like there's gonna be times where I don't want
The 3D, like I just wanna play
A 2D little game and have it at that
But what's interesting to me
Is that they are releasing movies
On the 3DS
At least if E3 is any indication
I guess we won't really know till the official
Press reveal or what have you
But they were showing a
Trailer for Tangled
The Rapunzel movie that's out in theaters
By the way it was actually really good
They were showing a trailer
For that at E3 on the 3DS
So they're gonna market
3D movies for kids on these things
So
You know
Granted you could say that well Tangled
Would also work for a 10-15
To an adult really year old
Come on
To an adult year old?
You know what parent isn't gonna want to sit
Their 6 year old in the back of the car and have them watch
Tangled to shut them up on a road trip
In 3D!
It'd be like buying an
Expensive 3D
HD television and going
You know what? I'm watching all
3D
I don't need this 3D
I'll pay your high premium price
For your TV with fancy technology
But I'm not, in fact you know what
I'm not even hooking up HDMI to it
I'm going straight composite bitch
So Nintendo
Is paranoid that
Some kid somewhere is gonna
Go cross eyed because they spent
12 hours a day looking at the
3DS and so they're putting this disclaimer
On it to kind of save their own butt because
Parents can't be bothered to watch how much
Their kids are playing games. That's what the story
Should really say, right?
At least that's what I think
Enablers!
I love this chat room
Chatter here, big wang eater
Um
So that'd be cool if 3DS had a deer hunter
In 3D, well you know what?
Cabela's comes out each year
They've been doing a lot of games on the DS
I would not be surprised if you see a 3DS
Cabela's game
Somewhere somehow some idiot parent
Will let their kid play that, their six year old
Kid play that in 3D. Big wang eater
Thank you big wang eater
Alright, 3D porn
Well the big wang eater goes on to say
3D porn, well you know
You will be able to take your own 3D pictures with this
You can show the big wang being eaten
Can you share the pictures you take
Like on the internet or whatever? I think you can
Awesome, time to penis
5 seconds, 5 seconds
Before we have a 3D penis
You know what?
See, some of us actually
Have people that we can
Do this in real life with
And don't need to watch it in 3D
We have what's called real life
Ah
They've also already been marketing like
When I did see that whole Tangled movie
Which by the way, I saw lots of
Six year olds in that theater wearing 3D glasses
And watching the movie, but anyway
They were showing a commercial
For a 3D camera
So you'd like watch the pictures on your 3D TV
That you take with the new camera
So, and this isn't DS related
It's like a new Sony camera or whatever
That does 3D pictures
Cause everybody has a boner for 3D right now
I like what Isam said
4D porn sex across time
I approve of that
Alright
That's what you need a TARDIS for
Well, moving on to other things
Nintendo that aren't necessarily 3D
But I bet a lot of people wish this was
Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword
Hey remember, there's a new Zelda game coming you guys
Remember?
They were talking about it
They were talking about it at E3 and it was delayed from Christmas
Rob ignored it
As if he has the upward thrust
Only in 2D
I'm sorry
But here's the deal guys, not only has it been delayed past Christmas
But now Nintendo is kinda saying
Yeah that whole early
2011 thing
Liars
That's not really gonna happen
Because of course there is very dense gameplay
And you're gonna want to replay this game
Dense?
That's not a description for gameplay
They have quietly
Moved this game to a
2011 release
Could be any time next year
We need to save it for
The holidays
For our Wii HD
It's gonna be a game that's slightly uprest
Well there you go
There's not a lot of
Like huge games I can think of that really have me
Excited that are coming out on the Wii anytime soon
Like it's all about the 3DS at Nintendo right now
So unfortunately this news is a little bit sad
Well
Hey they have innovative games for the Wii
Like Mario's Sports Mix
It's a sports game compilation
There's none of those on the Wii right?
That sound you heard in the background
That was crickets chirping
We have a soundboard for that
That was me blinking
Tired call on our chatroom talking about 3D by the way
It says 3D TVs are way behind in the 3D technology
Theaters now are using polarized lenses
Which doesn't need to use the shutter glasses technology
In other words you don't have to recharge the glasses to watch 3D
Exactly and that's what I'm saying they need to fucking do with those damn TVs
Cause those glasses are like $5 or free if you steal them from the movie theaters
You're not stealing them
You're paying the premium for them anyway
You're paying the recycler
They can go fuck themselves I'm paying for those damn glasses
Actually
But they're still gonna charge you the full theater price when you bring in
Whether or not you bring in your own pair of 3D glasses it seems like
Actually I thought it was a great suggestion
One of my friends suggested after seeing Tron
You know we should keep these glasses
And we should like bling them out
And like you know bedazzle them
And you'll put like pipe cleaner designs on them
And all this
So that way you know next time they try to hand you your 3D glasses
Oh no thanks I brought my own
They have designer polarized glasses you can get like pay like hundreds of dollars for
Awesome
Why?
You know what I should actually hold onto those to wear over my glasses
For when I go outside in the sun
Nice
Do those things work
The 3D glasses for the theater
They don't work with the TVs do they?
No
That was what we were saying
The only 3D technology that I think that's worthwhile is the Disney one
Just because it uses the polarized glasses
Or Nintendo's new technology which uses nothing at all
Exactly
They're actually looking to do TVs that way too
Which I think would really hurt your eyes
But I think that the polarized glasses are a good alternative
Because in that way instead of saying
Yeah you gotta buy this 3D TV
Oh by the way if you want more than two people to watch that
You're gonna need to buy another set of $100 glasses
Yeah
No thank you
Alright well
So Zelda Skyward Sword
2D, 3D, whatever D it's in
It's probably not coming out until December
What?
Upward thrust
Moving on
Well you know Final Fantasy 13 came out for the Xbox 360 in Japan
And guess what?
That's how well it did
It showed up at 39th in the software charts for Japan
Which is really low
So yeah they only sold
Well I'll put it this way the game that made number 20 sold 22,579 units
Yeah
That's kind of
So it probably sold about 10,000 or whatever
Something like that
Wasn't that how many 360 owners there are in Japan?
Well the number of
It's under 1.5 million
Users in Japan
And keep in mind the PS3
Is close to 6 million
So
Basically
There were a lot of
Also because of how early Final Fantasy 13 came out in Japan
And they thought it was only gonna be for
PlayStation 3 so a lot of people bought
A PlayStation 3 just to play Final Fantasy 13
I was gonna say when I first kind of heard about this story earlier in the week
I had gotten into Double Take and said
I thought they specifically said they are not doing 360 Final Fantasy 13 in Japan
So where the hell did this come from?
Well even with this one it had you know
A few extra goodies and you know
They brought other stuff out and did a price reduction on it
And it still wasn't enough
So kind of like the typical international editions they usually do in Final Fantasy games right?
But see now though
Well the whole thing is that typically these international editions have come out on the same console
And have had the English content
Like for example I've got
Final Fantasy X-2 International
And the game I can pick
Japanese or English language
I can choose my subtitles
And yeah I'm trying to
Watch this comparison to
To see you know
What the deal is and
The Xbox 360
One actually kind of looks like
Poop in comparison
Oh no it doesn't they look the same
I think people look way too
I think in order to see that level of detail
You have to be sitting as close to your TV
As you're sitting next to your monitor right now
Well yeah but I'm saying
You know but also for people who have
You know a really good HDTV
It's
Gonna make a difference like right now
The biggest things now keep in mind I also
Have an eye for it
I'm seeing difference in color quality
I'm seeing difference in line quality
You know
Yeah but how much of that can be blamed on the fact you're watching a streaming
And that's why Final Fantasy 13 sucked
No Final Fantasy 13 is great
It is I think it's a great
Game and it's
I don't understand all this hatred
Well I do understand why people are hating on it
But trust me I've played way worse games this past year
Final Fantasy 13 isn't even close
Well no I'm not saying it's at all bad
That would be Final Fantasy 14
Yeah seriously no I know you're not
I did the same thing with the Saturn and the Playstation
Versions of Castlevania Symphony of the Night
Because we had the Saturn
One and the uh
And we listened to the two
We watched both of them
The Saturn version had better 2D
Shitty 3D
The Saturn version had better sound quality
The Playstation version had better
Load times
So I'm the kind that does
This type of comparison so
Going back to the story at hand because I kind of feel like
The 360 PS3 debate on Final Fantasy 13
Was like 9 months old when the game came out
But going back to the story at hand
I get the sense people in Japan
Didn't buy this game because A
They didn't know for the longest time that it was coming out
And most people bought it on Playstation 3
Thinking it was never coming out on the 360
And B, you don't have
Close to that same
Adoption ratio you have here in the US
In Japan you're talking six
Playstation 3's for every one Xbox 360
That's not even
Close to the ratio here
Which is not the reverse but it's
A lot closer to one to one than that
And also though I have to look at it
This way too is that we're dealing with
Sony, a Japan based company
And we're dealing with Microsoft
A US based company
I think they're gonna know their markets a little bit
Better in their native area
That's really my point
You know
For example, the Saturn did
So much better in Japan than it did here
And a lot of it had to do with marketing
A lot of it had to do with audience
You know I think that
Going with the same thing I think that
Microsoft knew how to market to an American audience
They didn't know how to market to a Japanese audience
And maybe they didn't want the same type of
Features that we do here so you start off
With a less interested
Base and then you bring out a game
However long after
There's been another version
Out that's available to people who
Have the system
So it's
It's basically
I don't know why they expected it to do well
I was gonna say I was hoping Final Fantasy 13
Doesn't suck I just bought it but I haven't started it yet
It doesn't suck by the way
For the Xbox 360
It doesn't suck it's just better on PS3
I'll take your word for it then
And I don't even think it's
Negligible honestly
I don't think you would notice a difference
I was gonna say what's the difference honestly
You have to disc swap on the 360 version
You know what
We had to do that on the PlayStation 2
What kind of TV do you have an HD TV
That you play on or do you use the standard?
I have a Samsung
Is it full 1080
Or is it only 720
You might notice
Like the hair is a little different
It's an LED
Basically the big things you're gonna notice
Is difference in color
You won't notice any difference if you never see the
PS3 version I'll put it that way
But the big difference is that you're dealing with
More jaggedies
More aliasing on the
Xbox 360 version because the graphics processor
Is different the game was made for the PS3
So you're basically dealing with
The whole
Port issues
You're also dealing with the fact that there is
Rampant hardcore pornography in the Xbox
360 version
While there wasn't in the PS3 version
And that may offend some people but for me
That was a plus
I mean
It was much
I'd expect that kind of stuff in Mexico but
I'm not sure whether that makes me want to play it more or not
I don't need to know that about you
Anyhow
Why don't we travel the world and talk about some release dates
Some other games that might do a little bit better
Or
Not
This week is still a little bit light
January I mean come on
It's not a big ol' release month
Some cool stuff though coming out
But not so much this week
Lost in Shadow though on the Wii is making
It's way out so that puzzle game
From Hudson Soft it kind of has a little bit of a
Shadow Colossus vibe to it
That'll be on the Wii
And
Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the
Osborne house
That's on Nintendo DS
Cool you get to go to the Osborne's house?
Uh
Yeah
Not that Osborne house I'm afraid
Uh Emergency
2012
Um
I'm assuming that you play some sort of
Emergency crew when the world
Is ending and yes it looks about right
Actually so that's kind of cool
It says warning the world as we know it is out of
Control as the head of
All rescue operations you
Must ensure that you get the job
Done with fire and rescue services
Yeah I don't think fire and rescue services
Are going to stop a tidal wave from
Wiping out a city
I don't think that really works
But they'll try
They will try
Hold back that wave with your axe there
Um and then apparently Ghost Trick
Phantom Detective is supposed to be out
As well on Nintendo DS
And that is it
Traveling over to Japan this week
Uh not this week
But next week is when you start to see some stuff
On the 360 like Arcana Heart 3
But I guess I'll reiterate that next week
On the 360 going over to the Playstation 3
Kind of the same story
There's not really a lot out there either
I'm getting the sense it's going to be a very
Slow week
Nintendo Wii you don't even see anything until the end of the month
That's the crazy stuff
But the DS
The DS probably has your one highlight and big game this week
Saga 3
Jiko no Hasa
Shadow or Light comes out this week
That of course is in the Saga series
Right by Squeenix
On the DS and that's probably the big one
That people are going to be looking at and importing
When I look at the screenshots of this game
I really kind of go oh it's like a Saga game
That kind of looks like those Final Fantasy remakes they did on the DS
That's pretty much what you got there
So if you like the Saga series you'll probably be into that
And that is really it
That's like seriously the only thing
You have to look forward to this week
Um the PSP does have a slot machine
Game coming out but do you really care?
I don't think you do
So
A slot machine game you said?
Yes
You know that would actually do really well over here to get into
With the elderly market
Can I talk about Europe now?
I guess you can
Well um on the first there was
UFC trainer like no one really
Gives a crap about that
And on the fourth Lost in Shadow and guess what
That's it
Very slow week but you know the holiday
Shopping fever is gone so
Geez people
In two weeks we got two great games on the PS3
Isn't that ironic
Alright
Well we got a couple more stories for you guys
And then the classic game of the week
We'll close out part A in just a moment
Yes one of the bitches that we had last year
With Ubisoft with their
Really odd
Use of
DRM
They had a
Basically you had to be connected
To their servers the entire time
While you're playing different games
And if for whatever reason you
Feature or had some sort of
Connection problem whether it be just
A quick you know disconnect
Your game would actually stop
And you would have no opportunity to save or whatever
It would just totally fuck you up
And that was on even like single player games
Like Assassin's Creed 2
Or Splinter Cell Conviction
Well apparently though
There has been an update I guess
That
Those DRM checks are a little bit
Easier now
In fact on games
I guess like Assassin's Creed 2
And Splinter Cell Conviction for example
They have now
Made it where it just has to check
With the servers when you boot the game
But if you lose your internet connection
While playing the game it will not
Actually interfere with your game at all
So that's kind of cool
But also makes me think that it doesn't matter
Because people got around the stupid hacks
People don't want to deal with it
They won't that's the reality
They got around it anyways and all it
Really hurt was the people that bought
The game legitimately so
I don't know
But at least it's not
As terrible
Alright
Well kind of
One of the big stories from the end of last year was
The fact that Harmonix was being unloaded
By Viacom and it looks like we might have
Some resolution finally to this
A press release that came out over the holiday
From John Drake saying
That who is that Harmonix obviously
We are happy to confirm that the news today
That the sale of the company is complete
Viacom and MTV networks have been an
Amazing home for the past four years
Blah blah blah fluff fluff right
It's where we launched Rock Band and Dance Central
Beatles, Green Day, blah blah blah
We're excited to be returning to our roots as an
Independent and privately owned studio
And what this means the
DLC schedule marches on for
Rock Band, we will continue our support of
Previously released titles, and we're hard at
Work at some unannounced projects that we think
You're going to be pumped about
And the other half of this, it wasn't in the press release
But it was confirmed they are keeping the licenses
For Dance Central and Rock Band, they will get to
If they decide to make Rock Band 4
Or Dance Central 2
I think at least one of those is a sure thing
I would honestly say
I don't think Rock Band 4 is a sure thing at this point
I think Harmonix might do
Something new
The whole plastic instrument thing
But they may not call it Rock Band
And I think that's okay
I think sometimes your series needs a swift kick in the pants
So I would be
Quite okay with that if they decide
I'd be okay with Dance Central 2
I would be totally okay with Dance Central 2
And I think that's a sure thing
Of course there's going to be a Dance Central 2
Absolutely, it was clearly the biggest game on Connect
I'm so happy, we took down the tree today
The Christmas tree, so that we were able to move the
Coffee table out from the middle of the room again
And connect space again
Congratulations, there you go
So there it is, Harmonix going independent
That's a very
Kind of an obvious resolution
That none of us had guessed previously
So good luck
You kind of think
When people are talking about selling a company
It's like
You never really think, hey they could just buy themselves
Because they probably have a lot of money
Right?
Well, good luck to Harmonix
Pay off for them, we'll see
Anyway, let's take a minute not to talk about the future
Or this year, the coming year
But to reflect on the past
And gaming's history and how we all got here
To 2011 and gaming
It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week
In this segment, DarkSakura
Is going to go through the archives
In her cavernous vault
That she has here in the house
And find a game that she says, hey
It's not that big
Listen kids, you should be playing this game
Respect your elderly games
And what game did you pick this week?
Hard Drivin'
As in the nap machine
I will go into why it's the nap machine later
So forget all this
Need for speed stuff
Listen to those really great sound effects
Bong bong
Listen for a minute
That's about as much music as the game has
As a drum roll
Serious
Well then listen to some squeaking breaks
Listen to DarkSakura, tell us about this game
Hard Drivin' was basically
It was touted
According to this poster
As the world's first authentic driving simulation
Game
It was the first 3D polygon
Driving environment
It used a simulated cabinet
Virtual reality, oh my god, lawnmower man
It's real
And it was all on custom hardware
It had force feedback
A car physics simulator
And most of the
Design was done by
Some dude named Max Behensky
So that's pretty cool
Now also keep in mind that
Other games that came out around this time like
Pole Position and Outrun were sprite based
Scaling
Ah, you found the best part
The instant replay, trying to go up that loop
Basically, instead of
Having the sort of artificial graphics
Where the car wouldn't land
The right, you know, right side up
Or, you know
It actually used very realistic
Physics in the game
When you went too far off track
You would crash your skin
Your windshield would crack
You could keep driving
And then it also gave you the replay
Where you would die
And a hideous car fire
But you gotta admit, some of it's a little janky
Like the car explodes and then suddenly
In the next frame it's back together
It's very jank
We are very spoiled by today's graphics
Keep in mind, this was 1988
And this was a polygon game
In 1988
Wow, car explosions
Do not work that way
The car that you're supposed to be in
Is sort of like a Ferrari Testarossa
So I mean, that's pretty cool
You basically
Race
Against
This car called the Phantom Photon
And you can race the wrong way
You can do all this other stuff
It's actually, you know
It has, um, also
You can play it in automatic
You also have a realistic manual
Transmission with a clutch and everything
You can stall the car
When you miss shift
And, you know, like I said, force feedback and everything
So it's meant to be a driving simulator
And, you know
This game was
Pretty crazy for its time
It was put out by Atari
And
You know, they
This was really one of the coolest ones
For the record, the
Genesis version of this game is shit
Utter, utter shit
Oh, the Super Nintendo one was shit too
Yeah, um, so
As far as sequels that came out
There was Race Driving
In 1990, Hard Drivin' 2
Drive Harder that came out, um
On the
Yeah, on the Atari ST
And Commodore Amiga
An unreleased one called Hard Drivin'
Airborne in 1993
And then Street Drivin' that came out in 2001
On the GameCube, Playstation 2 and
Xbox, um, different versions
Came out, there
Hard Drivin' 3, now it's hard
Hard Drivin' 4 in my pants
Now, um
This that I'm gonna quote on here is that
The engine, transmission, control, suspension and
Physics were modeled in conjunction with
Doug Milliken who was listed
As a test driver in the game credits
So, um, that's actually
Pretty cool, um, this says that his father
William Milliken of Milliken
Research led a team at Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory
In Buffalo, New York that converted
Aircraft equations of motion
To equations of motion for the automobile
So it was a
You know, they actually used real science
In it, which I thought was pretty cool, it was meant to be a real
Stimulator
Um, as far as Easter Eggs
In the game, one of the buildings along
The speed course, um
Has a sign that says, uh, sorry
A sign above the door that says, The Hut
Um, if
If you made a hard left turn at the start
Of the game, you have a secret track
Which is a long straight road that leads to
A very short circular track
Around a tower
If you slow down and stop in front of one of the buildings
A keyhole appears in the building door
What?
Running into a cow will cause a moo sound to be played
At least in the Sega Genesis port
There's exactly one cow
Um, and
Ate carefully
After getting a sufficiently high score
Then, um, you get a full course race against the
Phantom Photon on the stunt track
So it's pretty cool
Um, but, now I have to tell you
About, now I'm gonna
Put a picture of the cabinet in the chatroom
Um, for a reason
For a specific reason
This thing had
A chair that would swivel out
And
Inside it was very dark
So one day when I was working at
Cyber station at Bel Air Mall
In Mobile, Alabama
There was nobody
In the damn mall
It was Tuesday morning
I had been up all night, so guess what I did?
I sat my happy butt
Inside the chair at hard driving
I filled myself in, and I took a three hour nap
Well, you know, not like a
A full on nap
I could still hear people
No one came in
I got all my other stuff done
And I sat in the hard driving machine
And took a three hour nap
It was dark, the chair was comfortable
How colossally irresponsible of you, but funny
Oh please
I was 19
So
But at any rate
That's my story about the hard driving cabinet
It's the great nap machine
The game actually, I'll be honest
I don't like playing hard driving
It's hard
And time has not treated it well
No it hasn't
But it's notable for what it is
I gotta click on this link
Cause there's a YouTube suggestion here
The worst Genesis game ever made
Hard driving
I just wanna remind myself how fucking terrible this is
Okay, I don't wanna hear some asshole
Talking about it, I just wanna see it here
Oh yeah, with the
And I say that with love
Crazy ass draw in on the thing
Oh my god, the framery on here is so awful
It's hideous, it's hideous
But I mean
God, can you imagine that people
Somebody somewhere actually dropped like $50 on this game
I know
It's one freaking track, right?
You missed the cow, Rob, you missed the cow
Well I'm gonna burn in hell for all eternity
For missing the damn cow
I like Test Drive 3
And it came out around the same time
Looked very similar to this
And they, um
They came out after this
You also have to race other cars
And I used to try to take a shortcut by driving off-road
Not something a performance
High speed vehicle is meant to do
But I did encounter lots of deer
Deer
Rob's looking at the Commodore 64
Yes, Commodore 64 hard driving
I have to see this
Wow
It's like $10
And this framery is awful
Oh wow
You could grow old playing this game
Imagine
I know this is terrible radio
Imagine you're playing, I'll link it in the chat
But for those listening on the podcast
Imagine you're playing hard driving on the Game Boy
The old Game Boy
Like the old Game Boy
Monochrome
There's the link in chat
Somebody spent $50 on this game
Just so you know
Is there a loop even?
Oh no, here's the bridge
Crash
Actually, you might get better
You might get a faster framerate on the Game Boy
And then that was, wow
Rama in our chat room says
I worked in a video store when this game came out
It did pretty well in sales
Because it's virtual reality, man
It's crazy, wave of the future
Or something
At any rate
Like I said
I'm not a fan of the game itself
However, I will
You're a big fan of naps
I love naps
But I will give it props
For what it is and what it did at the time
If not for hard driving
We may not have Ridge Racer
That's true
This is
The beginning of our 3D racing games
Right here
Even though this game really
Hasn't been treated well with time
And it's kind of shit now
Without it, we wouldn't have some of the stuff we have today
Because people
Like to do loopy loops and jumpy jumps
I just figured I took so many damn naps in the machine
I may as well play it a couple of times
I'll tell you something else that's funny
I want to tell it to other people
Who have worked in an arcade
We got an allotment of 25 tokens a week
Tell me
Once you started working at the arcade
Stop using your damn tokens
Did you not play anything for a while?
Because you were tired of being there
When I quit Rob, seriously
I had 600 and something tokens
I played a lot of Skee-Ball
And a lot of Street Fighter Alpha 2
5th Dream in our chat room says
VR without glasses
Without glasses, sound like anything recent?
I see what you did there
Alright
That may be a very topical
And appropriate game of the week
It might be a lot
Crazier than you think
There it is, a classic game of the week
Hard driving
On various systems
But we're going to give it to the arcade
Because the arcade one can nap in
And definitely not the Commodore 64
Definitely not that one
Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange
Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere, we're not done
We've got plenty more show to go
We're going to talk about Chrono Trigger
Super Meat Boy, Valve, Indie Games
The 3DS, yes more
But we have some actual big news about it
So we're going to talk about all that when we come back with more
Of Orange Lounge Radio, so don't go anywhere
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
The show where every gamer has a voice
We're taping episode number 395
Tonight, January the 2nd of
2011, it's our first show of 2011
Rob Roberts here with you
Over the next few hours, of course DarkSakura, Loki
And our special guest tonight, Gary here in studio
Talking about video games and so forth
We're going to get into the rapid fire news
In just a minute, but first
Some quick plugs for some other shows that we here
At OLR are branching out into
By the way, special thanks to the
Forces that be at our website for putting the little
Links now right there on OrangeLoungeRadio.com
So if you're curious about some of the other shows
We do, they are all right there
So DarkSakura does a show, it's called
Comic Insanity
Talks a lot about comic books
Yep, and we are dark until
Next week, so we will be recording
Again this next weekend
All right, the best
Little Horde House in Azeroth
My little show about Warcraft, which by the way
Had some Comic Insanity crossover this week
Tiara was our special guest, or Maron Marvel
From that show, so it's a good one to listen to
It was actually a really good show this week I had to say
So check that out at
Our link in iTunes
We don't really have a website yet, working on it
So search us in iTunes
Horde House, H-O-R-D-E space
H-O-U-S-E, or we are linked
Right there at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
We have a blog spot technically, but that's just what
We use to link our feeds, so we don't
Don't take that too seriously
Anyhow, that's that
Let's get into some quick news
Some rapid news, believe it or not
There was still some stuff that happened in the gaming world
This week, so
Believe it or not, few things
Christmas doesn't stop everything
So it was announced
This week at Pokemon Black and White
We'll be headed over to
North America on March 6
You'll be able to play with your
Pokemans on that date
And of course the two versions
Will have slightly different
Themes to them I guess this time
The black version will offer
Pokemon
Looks like a Reshirium
And a setting called
Black City, while white will contain
A lush green area called
White Forest
And will let you capture a Pokemon
Named Zekrom
Boy, they're having to get
Creative with the alphabet soup on these
Pokemon names, aren't they?
So
Those are actually going to be
Coming March 6
On the
Nintendo DS
Also
Not really coinciding
With that, but next month
There's going to be some
Pokemon downloads available
At GameStop and Toys R Us
This is actually happening between
January 30th and February 5th
At Toys R Us
You're going to be able to pick up
Ash's
Pikachu
A version of that character
With a special set of abilities at Toys R Us
I guess
He starts off at
Level 50
Cool, I guess
Some other stuff you can check out
Of course at GameStop
During
I guess during different weeks
They're going to have different Pokemon you can download
January 3rd through the 9th
They have
Raikou
Looks like 17th through 23rd
And Tai
And
Looks like
Entei, I guess
31st through February 6th
Suisin
And
That means nothing to me, by the way
Because I don't play Pokemon
Nor do I understand what any of these
Really flamboyant
Slightly mythological creatures
That almost looks like a dog
But if you want to be
The very best
No one ever was
You gotta catch them all
It's like STDs
To train them is your cause
Gotta catch them all
Uh
Something that
I'm not sure a lot of people may be wanting to catch
Do you think antibiotics could
Clear up a bad case of the Pokemans?
I'm on a strong
Dose of antibiotics right now
And I have no
Urge to play Pokemans
So maybe
Dynasty Warriors 7
Is coming to North America
March 22nd
And it will be, I guess, the first version
That will include 3D
And move support, of course on the Playstation 3
And I guess
The game will also be on Xbox 360
As well
Some new stuff that's gonna be in the game
Apparently they have a
Free roam mode dubbed Chronicle mode
There's gonna be 60 playable characters
And I believe online co-op
Is the other brand new thing
So yay
And then last but not least
As
A lot of games seem to
Kind of go this route
Devil Summoner Soul Hackers
Is a game that I guess came out on the Saturn
Back in Japan in 1997
It has not been released
Over here in North America
Or has gotten an English release anywhere in the world
I remember that game
So now
A group of hackers calling themselves
Devil Hackers
What a friendly name
They're working on a fan made
Translation of the title for
The PSP
And of course
They have a teaser trailer
For it, but it's like 13 minutes long
So that's a big tease
That's a long trailer, geez
That is a long trailer
I mean, do we really need to watch a trailer of
Like, hey look, the game's in English now
I mean, this, I don't know
You know what, I hadn't heard about this game
Until tonight, so maybe some people just need to
Know about its epic epicness
Maybe
Hey, speaking of epic, Rock Band
Is a very epic music game
And there's an epic musician coming to the game
This week, and it doesn't get any better
Than Johnny Cash, ladies and gentlemen
Coming this week to Rock Band
And it's a big pack of
8 songs that you can get for
About, what is that
1080 Microsoft points
It's about 14 bucks and all said and done
Cry Cry Cry
Don't Take Your Guns to Town
Five Feet High and Rising
Folsom Prison Blues
I Got Stripes
I Walk the Line
Tennessee Flat Top Box
And the Ballad of Ira Hayes
Awesome
Also, if that wasn't good enough, Dark Soccer
Free songs coming out this week
Free shit
It is 9 songs for free
It's the Rock Band pack
It's just merry freaking January
There it is, 9 songs for free
They are all, of course, indie bands that
Kind of have ties to harmonics like Bang Camaro
And you know, things like that
But hey, you know what, free is free
You might find some music you like
So there you go
By the way, also, some pro guitar and bass
Stuff on some of those Johnny Cash songs
Rob!
But only like I Walk the Line and Tennessee Flat
Our friend has brought over the guitar
The pro guitar
Well, I didn't get to see it used
But it was really nice
So many buttons on it
Better be nice for the price that it is
Right?
He seemed to like it
I watched him playing stuff with it
It was pretty cool
I mean, not last night, but New Years
If you
Like Rock Band 3
And you like Fallout 3
Then this song is for you
And it's on the Rock Band Network
You're going to have to dig for this one a little bit
It's Kirby Crackle
Doing the Fallout tribute song
Vault 101
And that's a little play on
Where you start in the game
Fallout 3
That's available on the Rock Band Network store
So if you like that song
There's a clip of it available on YouTube
Rock Band isn't the only game
Getting some download stuff coming
Dance Central is still kicking
It is still going
In fact, actually it came out a couple weeks ago
But we were off for the holidays
Let's see
Rihanna came out with Disturbia
Girls and Boys
By Blur
That's kind of cool
And Janet Jackson with Control
Awesome
Would you dance to Girls and Boys in Dance Central?
I know you like your Blur
Super Meat Boy
If you were waiting for this game on the Nintendo Wii
You are going to be waiting forever
That is because the Wii version of Super Meat Boy
Is gone
What it boils down to
You can read a very interesting
Press release or statement from the folks behind
Super Meat Boy
But basically, the 40 megabyte limit
Imposed on WiiWare games by Nintendo
Means the Super Meat Boy version would have been
Shit
There would have been tons of songs
The Dark World levels wouldn't have even been there
Basically, you would have gotten a
And they called it this, a shitty version of Super Meat Boy
So it would fit right in with everything else
Really
But what's kind of sad about this is that
Originally, this was announced as a WiiWare game
And so they've had to do a little bit of backtracking
Saying, hey, we know Wii originally announced this
As a WiiWare thing
But guess what?
I think it was that Nintendo was really the first
To announce it
Specifically for the Wii to begin with
They were just making a game and Nintendo kind of wanted it
And B
You know what? The game grew bigger
And it's a great game
And if you own a Wii
You probably have a PC somewhere in your house
Even if you don't have a 360
At least you can get this game somewhere
The game will not be coming out on the PlayStation 3
Due to an arrangement
With Microsoft
You can kind of read between the lines there
Dark Sakura
Well, Squeenix has decided
That they are going to
Have another Final Fantasy game
Duh!
They actually filed for a European trademark
For Final Fantasy Type 0
And has it under everything
From computer game software to toy swords
So
Maybe it'll be cool
Then we have new characters
For Tekken Tag Tournament 2
There's a Lutadora
And
They don't know her name
But she's pink!
She's wearing a rasslin' mask
She makes me think of Rainbow Mika
And it's a she
So maybe they're taking a page from Capcom's book
And then
In other news
There's actually a few more things
That are sort of cementing in
That the
Previously rumored taskmaster
Akuma and Sienkou
Are going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3
And that's in the way of
Xbox 360 achievements
There is one called
For those who dwell in darkness
And so that's going to be a team
Composed of all Darkstalkers characters
So that means three characters
So there's going to be another Darkstalker
So far we just have Felicia
And Morrigan
So all the rumors are going to Sienkou
And then there's one called Fate of the Satsui no Haro
Which is
Which is going to be
Basically the only other person
That Ryu could fight would be
Akuma
Because that's the only person in game canon
Would have that going on
Unless you count Marvel superheroes
What about the guy that's from
Super Street Fighter 4
The one that was
What was it
Not Shenlong
Or whatever
Oh, Gokun
Like, it was another character
It wasn't Akuma
Or whatever, it was supposed to be there
Yeah, Gokun
There's Sensei, that's Gokun
And he doesn't follow that
Oh
Because he's hardcore badass and has cool music
And then the other one
Of course the rumor was Taskmaster
Who, I'm like, dude, he's not even relevant
Why put him in it, but
I guess, but there's
There's supposed to be
More going on with that one
They also said there's
Another list of achievements
Among others are who will answer the call
And this achievement is
Participate in 8 player lobby
On Xbox Live, so
There's going to be lobbies
So we also
Get the Sentinel and
Hagar are also rumored to be
In it, I'm just happy
That X-23 is in it, so
That's it
Sounds like a definite purchase for you
Than Dark Sakura
Hell yeah
It doesn't even matter what character
Deadpool
I am sick of Deadpool in the comics
But I love everything else that has Deadpool in it
Does that make sense?
No, but that's okay
Twitter.com slash OLR
Every week we ask you to show us your tweets
And we will respond to them here on
The program
We're going to start tonight with a tweet
Nathan Jackson on Twitter
Question for OLR
Is the Kinect going to fundamentally change
Gaming to the point of abandoning
Controllers completely?
I'm going to give that a big fat
No, because some people
Like to touch things
They like that, and funny enough
I think that's all kind of part of Sony's
Marketing campaign is that
Sometimes people want tangible things
But
Here's case in point
There's only so much of the iPhone
Gaming I can take because I don't have those
Tangible buttons and the responsiveness
Isn't always there for me
I think they seriously need to
Aren't they supposed to be unveiling
New stuff soon or something?
I think MacWorld is coming up this week
This month
They seriously need some sort of controller thing
Or something
It would really help
Will it change gaming?
Sure, this type of technology
Has been slowly coming at us ever since
The Wii, I mean what you're seeing with
The Kinect is really just an evolution of something
We've kind of seen before
And it will evolve again
So is the Kinect
Here to stay in gaming culture?
Sure, but is it going to
Eliminate what you know of games today?
Nah, not until we have
The holodeck, once the holodeck's here
Then it's all over, because remember
And I've said this on the show a lot
Everything we do
And with every generation
Is bringing us one step closer to the holodeck
For reals
Once gaming reaches the holodeck
We're on the last generation of gaming
Even then there might be a holodeck 2.0
Huh, I don't know
Alright, let's see, moving on with some other tweets
I'm going to
DJ Rama S sends us a tweet
Interesting
EA is being sued
By gamers
Because of the football license
Exclusivity
That they have
That's the story that he's linking us to
I thought I heard about this before
Maybe something has progressed with this
I could have sworn I heard something about this before
But it was like years ago
But anyway, whatever
Let's see
They're saying
We believe EA forced consumers to pay an artificial premium
On Madden NFL video games
We intend to prove that EA could inflate prices
On their sports titles
Because these exclusive licenses
Restrain trade and competition
For interactive sports software
Because, you know, when NFL 2K5 came out
It was only 20 bucks
And EA had to sell Madden 2005
At 30 bucks
And then once the exclusive deal hit
Well shit, those games just cost like 60 bucks
Since then
They want anybody who's purchased
An EA football game since August 2005
To get damages in this settlement
Which if it ends up being this whole class action thing
Means every person will probably get 50 cents
Hope you retained all your proof of purchases
For these 5 year old games
Good luck
By the way, yeah, I knew this was old
It was originally filed in mid 2008
But, what's new about it
A judge has recently allowed
This lawsuit to proceed
I thought I'd heard about this before
It was just that long ago
But it's moving forward, it wasn't laughed out of court
So that could be interesting
A story for us
From TigerClaw305
About the
Galaga World Record attempt
Let's see
Andrew Laidlaw
Of Washington State
Has claimed the Galaga
Record, and he did it on
New Year's Day
4,525,150 points
As certified by
Twin Galaxies, because you know
They carry the spirit stick
They say it goes, so they are the authority
On video game high scores
That was a record taken from
Phil Day, who set a
3.2 million record in November
Of 2009
He said, quote, the first time was magical
In a way, this time it's a huge
Relief. Well, congratulations
A lot could be said about
Sex, that way
I was gonna say, you know
Ability to perform
Under stress
Oh, you crazy kids
That's gonna do it for the tweeters tonight
TigerClaw linked us another story, but it's coming up a little later in the show
Also Spaznator is
Not enjoying the changes
To the feed, because he's not able to tune in
Remember guys, allgames.com
Is really the best place for you to tune in
It is HTML5 compliant
I think the only people that are getting screwed are the PSP people
Because I'm not sure the PSP browser
Supports the HTML5
Hopefully there will be a solution for you guys
Soon, but yeah
A lot of change-a-roonies going around at all games
Radio, from what I understand
Not bad stuff, just, you know
New year, new stuff
Out with the old, in with the new
So some of the shows that are no longer around
They're gonna be replaced with some new live shows
So, you know, it'll be nice to have some new stuff going on
So with that comes streaming changes, et cetera, et cetera
So hopefully they get all that worked out
In the next couple weeks, and then we can update
All our fun little PSP stuffs
And get everybody back on board
Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news
Mailbag is coming up in a little bit
Mailbag at orangeontrader.com and Fuse of the Week
And of course the Skype line
But first, some more news
Oh yeah, good stuff
So this is kinda neat
You know, Valve is pretty
Kind of on the cutting edge with different things
They definitely put out a lot of popular games
And of course
One of the things that they actually have interest in doing
Is providing
Better experiences for those
Who may be disabled
For example
One of the things that they're looking on to do
Is with eye tracking
This would provide
Ways for people that, you know, for example
Don't have full body movement
To be able to play
Without having to
Use their hands
Or their entire body
As an input device
And it says
It may be possible in the future
Let the eyes act as the proxy
For the mouse cursor letting gamers
Transmit navigation
And targeting inputs via eye movements
If you couple this
With the use of blinks
And other proxies for button
Predices, you may remove
The need for a mouse and keyboard
Or gamepad altogether
So that's pretty cool
So, break this down for me
How exactly is that gonna work?
They're gonna have some sort of way
To track where your eyes are looking
And basically
They're gonna have some sort of system in place
Where, for example, say
If I blink my eyes
A certain way or something
Like a double blink or something like that
That it will act as a key press
Or maybe if I tilt my head a little bit
It's meant for gamers
That have very
Limited movement
Who's that genius guy in the wheelchair?
Stephen Hawking
Stephen Hawking games
Wasn't it
I wanna say it's Atari
But I'm not 100% certain
It had this thing called a psychic controller
All it did was control
The mind thingy
I can't remember the name of it
But it really just used
The movement of the forehead
And blinking of the eyes to do the control
It's the same concept
But now that the technology has caught up
That it could actually be
To track your retinas
An ultra-fine Kinect
Oh certainly
I think the technology has come up
Well enough to make it something viable now
I'd hate to have that
With somebody with epilepsy
That wouldn't work
But it's a neat concept
Especially though
With
I was thinking
There's other uses for head tracking out there
But that's really, I think, innovative
I'm all about
Making games more accessible
I don't know if this stuff could ever replace
But if it helps enable
And bring more people to the table, then hooray
Then maybe people won't sue
Well, you know
People will sue about what they can sue
Alright
Anyhow, Rama says in our chatroom
At chat.orangelandreary.com
I'm reminded of those special custom controllers
Nintendo put out for disabled people to play their games
Hmm
I don't even remember seeing those
But of course
I never bought one
But I think I remember seeing it on a TV show
Or something
Anyway, moving on
This is something very exciting
What is old is new again
Chrono Trigger
Yeah, that's right, the old school
Super Nintendo game
Is apparently coming back all over again
Sit down, it's not a sequel
But it's the inevitable
Mobile version of the game
There's a teaser site up now
On Squeenix's Japanese
Website
That apparently a mobile phone version of Chrono Trigger
Is on the way
Spring 2011 is the release
Very interesting
Now here's the thing to consider
If it's coming out of mobile phones in Japan
Especially the way this thing looks
With the whole PSP style upgrade graphics
I'm really reading really far into this
But the font they use on
The 2011 Spring
Looks like some of the fonts I see in the Final Fantasy remakes
Yeah, I'm jumping way ahead with this guys
But the point is
It probably will inevitably come out for the iPhone
That was wordy
Wasn't it? Probably will inevitably, whatever
It's probably going to come out for the iPhone
At some point, I just don't want to guarantee it
Because I don't know anything
But hey, Secret of Mana just came out on the iPhone
Did you know that on the iPad?
I didn't like the way it controls, but that's just me
Of course, because the controls on the iPhone suck
Like, trying to emulate that whole control pad
Just doesn't work
I have yet to see a game that it works in
The best iPhone games are the ones that
Evolve either just tapping
And not like having to emulate a control
Or tilting, like everything else
Kind of blows
I will disagree
There are two games that it works on
And they're both cave games
One is for
Espaluda
Espaluda 2
Having the drag
Across there actually works very well
And the little controller thing from Ushihime Sama
Super Bug Panic
Actually works really well too
Amiga777 in our chatroom says
Hope they don't abandon like they did for Agito
Oh, that's right, the Final Fantasy 13
Remember that? Well, keep in mind Amigo
We haven't heard anything about Versus either
So it could still be happening
Later this year
I have a feeling Final Fantasy 13 Versus
Is going to be the big thing we hear about at E3 this year
From Squeenix
At least in the JRPG camp
Because certainly they have the Tomb Raider reboot now
Isn't that weird that the Tomb Raider reboot is a Squeenix game now?
Kind of talk about this
All the different camps there
SalaciousPop in our chatroom says
They'll charge $9 for the ROM
Just like Secret of Mana for iOS
$9 for an iOS ROM hack
Well, hold on
You could kind of read into that
A couple ways
Because I don't think it's really a ROM hack
Because they do have to adapt it
For a different screen resolution
And they are putting those controls in it
$9 is still a lot though
I mean, I hear you there
But those games will inevitably come down in price
It'll be $9 this month
$7 next month
$0.99 when there's a big sale
And that's when I will finally get it
At some point
And I urge you to do the same thing
Savalas in our chatroom says
Angry Birds is amazing on iPhone
iPad, iTouch
You know I still haven't played that game
I've heard very mixed things on Angry Birds
Angry Birds is
Frustrating and fun
I've had it downloaded forever
And I still have not played it
And then they taunt you with their little snort noises
Stupid green pigs
I've played some iPhone games
I've played that Smurf village game
Finally
And I played that dungeon crawler game
That Loki gifted me a couple weeks ago
It was really pretty
But it was kind of hard to control
Well I mean
It's still really pretty
It's probably better on the iPad
I don't know, for some reason
You're so cramped on the phone
I would think on the iPad you might have a little bit better
Oh I forgot to mention
They have Raptor Call of the Shadows
On iOS now
Oh really? Remember that old shareware game?
Oh wow
How much do they want for that?
I wouldn't know
Alright
Let's move on, Dark Sakura
Meat
Meaty meat meat
Meat
Actually
Super Meat Boy is going to have some goodies coming out
More beefy goodness
Meat
With the
Next update
It's supposed to be a free PC update
There is
There is going to be
A level editor
An online level portal called Super Meat World
And something called
Enter the Unknown
But with the editor you can basically
Go
Recreate anything in the game
Except the bosses
You can actually determine
Which characters will play the level
You have all kinds of different stuff going on
But you have to hit all the validation
To make sure that you can upload it
The online level portal
Basically
Is just lets you go check out all the levels
That people have made
Super Meat World
Is a big hub
And is
What's going to bring you new chapters
To the game
And it unlocks with
30 bandages
And pops up on the map before the first
Chapter actually begins
And then Enter the Unknown which is exclusive
For the PC
Picks a random user made level
And filters it based on whatever difficulty
That you picked
So
Basically it just is giving you a random
Player created level
Based on the difficulty that you've selected
So pretty cool
That's pretty cool
That's interesting that whole random
S ability
It's Mystery Meat
That's what they should have called it was Mystery Meat
I like that
Trademark that today
That sounds so wrong
Super Meat Boy
Worst title ever
And worst, yeah I've said this a million times on the show
Worst little logo ever
But awesome game
Bandage Girl
You've got to be kidding me
I know we never did an appropriate top games
Of the year
But Super Meat Boy
Definitely would have been near my top of the list
I'm showing
I'm showing Gary the beginning of the game
This is
This is real? Wow
Loki dare I ask if you had
To pick one game for your game of the year
Last year
Is it possible? Red Dead?
That's what everybody else picked
Red Dead was alright
I don't know
I still play Grand Theft Auto though
But Red Dead was kind of cool
I don't know if I would say it's my game of the year
Though
Maybe
I can't pick one
That's why we didn't even try to do that
There was a lot of great games last year
So we just took last week off
Think about it
I know a top contender for game of the year
This year is going to be
Well what do you think?
Earth Defense Force
Insect Overgeddon
But see last year
I'm pretty sure I would have said on the end of the year
Classy 14 is going to be the best game of the year
Next year
Boy was I wrong
I'm still going to say Star Trek Online
Was my game of the year
Unfortunately it was the game that only lasted
Me a year
Mine was probably
Civ 5
He would say that
Of course I would
Anyhow
Let's move on with some more news
We've got the mailbag coming up in just a minute
We've talked a little bit about the Xbox Live
Indie Games Winter Uprising
It's a group of developers
That are putting out games on the Indie Games Store
That are kind of getting pissed
That there's a lot of crappy games out there
And a lot of clones
And ripoffs of other things
Although
If we're going to really get into
Nitpicking on the stuff
Their games aren't exactly original either
But whatever
What's cool though is Microsoft has actually
Put up a banner
Or I should say a little
Highlight spot
That you can actually check those out
From the
Xbox Live Marketplace
They actually added to their spotlight
And
I believe now all the games have been released
That are a part of that
One of the few last ones here
Cthulhu Saves the World
Apparently came out
Earlier last week
And then also they had
Breath of Death 7
Which was the last one
Cthulhu Saves the World looks like it was made with RPG Maker
But yeah
You can check those out
And check out the
Little link on Indie Games Winter Uprising
Plus there's plenty of games out there
That really need to be checked out
And a lot of them
Actually all of them have free demos
And they're cheap
A lot of them are really cheap out there
So check out the demos
Buy the full game
What are the huge Indie Games
That I should be playing? Do we know of any?
Cause I tried a couple and
I gotta admit, nothing that really
Nothing that really made me want to come on the show and talk about it
Haven't you played Carnivale?
I haven't
I was looking at that Breath of Death
Whatever though, I was gonna download that
I just didn't get around to it
I think that's what it was called
It was one of the first Indie Games I picked up
And it's awesome
So good
It's kind of a game where you launch
This clown rag doll
Thing into the area
And you collect balloons and stuff
But it's
Really
Kinda cool
I just like the art style in it and everything
But yeah, Carnivale
I'm trying to think of some other ones
That are actually pretty cool
There
There was one, oh god, what the hell was that?
There was one
It was
It was some sort of
Obama
Fighting game or something like that
Oh dear
What the hell was it?
It was something ridiculous
It was some dude that
Was
Running around and there would be people
Trying to attack you and you can
Pick up a bus and smash them with the bus
Oh, you showed me
Videos of that, I remember
It looked like bad dudes or something
It was pretty funny
Are you a bad enough dude to be the president?
Nice
Alright, well you think of some others
I don't know, I haven't really been on Indie Games
In a while, so
You'll have to remedy that soon, alright
Well anyway, let's talk about
This is definitely not about Indie Games
It's about games that people are looking forward to
Next year, the Nintendo 3DS
Is a huge, huge thing of course
It's going to be about 2011
Because everything has to be in 3D in this day and age
So the 3DS is getting a big
Public showing in February
In Japan
3DS will also be at the World Hobby Fair
It's going to be at some Japanese shopping centers
Crazy, crazy
Excuse me, crazy stuff
But here's some of the games
That are going to be playable
At this exhibition
Nintendo World 2011
The new Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D
Pro Evolution 3D Soccer
Street Fighter IV 3D
Resident Evil Revelations
Dynasty Warriors Chronicle
Dead or Alive Dimensions
Oh man, Dead or Alive Dimensions
Imagine those titties bouncing in full 3D
It's going to be amazing
Ridge Racer 3D
Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle
Nintendogs plus Cats
Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D
Steel Diver Pilotwings Resort
AR Games and the Nintendo 3DS
Camera
Now there's some other stuff that is not playable that's going to be shown
Kingdom Hearts 3D
Super Monkey Ball 3D
Puzzle Bobble 3D
Star Fox 64
Animal Crossing Mario Kart
So on and so on
Probably the same shit we saw at E3
But maybe with a new coat of paint
I don't know
By the way, most people are predicting it will be $2.99
I'm going to say
I agree with that, $2.99
and the Zelda Ocarina of Time is the pack-in
Because it's a huge
game without being
a lot of money
spent by Nintendo, you know what I mean?
I think that will be the pack-in game
The camera, the Zelda Ocarina of Time
3D, maybe some samplers
with some of these other trailers and so stuff
Other stuff, but it won't be Kid Icarus
I'll tell you that, that will not be the pack-in game
Alright
And that's just
I have nothing to go off of
Just what I think
Let's get to what you think in the mailbag
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
is a place to send your emails every week
Dark Soccer will dive in the mailbag
and pick some of her favorite emails
and read them for us here on the air
I will
But I think the holidays slowed people down, didn't it?
Yep
This one, the OLR 2010 Predictions Forum thread
We got next to nothing
and mine were all wrong
but thankfully so
I won't be posting
a 2011 thread this year
I would like to mention a heavily self-biased list
of some notable things that happened
Don't include the stuff if it was part of your year-end wrap-ups
I'm gonna do it anyway
Well, we didn't even end up doing your year-end wrap-ups, so there you go
2010 Slimeball Award
Activision
Dismantling of Infinity Ward was
so as not to pay bonuses
for a job while being gamefully employed
is not a reason to fire them
In fact, the games industry
will be best served
if you encourage career development across companies
The decision was very profit-oriented
and slimy
One thing I hope the developer studios should have learned
is to put in their contracts
that bonuses are paid
based on project, not employment
2010 Last to the Party Award
Me! I joined Facebook in August
2010
Developer of the Year, PopCap
Their games are not hard-hitting, but they sure are fun
PopCap is really good at breathing new life
into old games, plant versus zombies on new systems
with new features, Bejeweled 3,
Zuma's Revenge, and Zuma Blitz
2010 Welcome to the 21st Century Award
Steam
Steam made no-box direct sales of software
worth it with their great prices
Think you shouldn't pay as much for a game
because the cost of packaging and media isn't an issue?
Steam understands that
The newest games are pricey, but their sales
on right now make it affordable
2010 Best Use of Meat
in a Game's Title, Super Meat Boy
They managed to use the initials SMB
to hilarious effects
I'm looking forward to what you guys come up with
Ra-ba-buh
Ba-bom
That's cute
Last one
Dear Peoples of the Intertubes
You put out the call on Twitter for gaming-related
New Year's resolutions. Well, most of my resolutions
have to do with writing
My only vaguely gaming-related one
is to pay off my credit card, which I've
only used to buy my two-year-old
laptop. Besides, I don't make
resolutions as much as I make goals. Goals
tend not to have an expiration date that leads to
disappointment in yourself. Stay black, redertainment
This message was brought to you by
Windows 7, which totally fucked up my
two-year-old laptop, sent for my iPad
Well, you gotta have the money to buy the games, so
Ah, good ol' reliable iPad
And if you pay off your credit card, you can always
run it all up again. Just kidding
You know what I have noticed? Don't look too crazy. What?
I have better luck sending emails from my iPhone
than I do my PC sometimes. Really?
Because my iPhone has never crashed on me
Alright, well let's get to the FUs of the week
I've had iPhone apps crash on me
just so you know. I've had apps crash
but there's no such thing as a BSOD
on an iPhone. Yet
But there is a such thing as the
alarms suddenly not working on the iPhone
I don't know if you heard about that
It's not a perfect world
Let's get to the FUs of the week
FU to my back and now my butt
Because I was playing with my friend's son
and he's heavy
and I've wrenched my lower back
and it's since settled in my right side
I have a bad hip for the record
I've been in two car accidents
and injured my hip both times
and I'm in a lot of pain
I've taken significant Vicodin today
significant, I won't say how much
and um, I still hurt
I'm walking around like I'm, you know, 90
and I don't like it
Also, I FU'd to the tail end of this cold that refused to go away
which makes me very antisocial and bitchy
Is that all?
Okay, Loki
What's your FUs of the week, Loki?
My FU of the week would be to
I don't know, the weather
sucks
I don't really have anything
Uh, Gary
Do you have any FUs of the week?
Things that are making you mad?
I would have to
agree with Loki on that one
the weather around here has blown goats
all days yesterday and today
I hate rain
but I've said that before
I mean, other people will remind me
that yes, we need it
but still, it makes everything
especially driving more difficult
and
yeah, that's the only one I want to say right now
It can rain up in the hills
and trickle down here
Well, it can rain, yeah, it can rain at night
when I actually don't have to drive
but, oh well, whatever, that's life
I don't think the environment cares if you're driving or not
I'm pretty sure it doesn't
but I'm still frustrated all the same
Um, I would say
FU to
Comcast!
My internet provider
Comcast is evil
My internet is still dropping out
I came out to my house last week
to try to fix it
and I'm still getting
randomly dropped from the internet
which is affecting my Warcraft playing
Sorry, you know
Jamie and I have a mutual friend who has Comcast
and she's always complaining about issues with it
so I can feel your pain on that one
Hey, at least the tech who came to my house
was really nice, but I kind of got the sense
in just what he was saying that
yeah, this seems to be a problem in Comcast's office
and I'm just really here to validate that there's a problem
You know, like
so frustrating
At least nobody came into your neighborhood and snapped the main
fiber optic cable
You remember when that happened to me?
Well that's not Comcast though, that's just some jackass
That's some asshole
But anyhow, that's it for my FUs of the Week
Just FU to the fact I can't run instances
and wow, because I always get disconnected
Rude and ignorant
Couple more news stories for you guys
and then the Skype line 877-GAME-OLR
but not just yet, we got two more stories for you
Mikey?
Yes, so
to kind of wrap things up
and this is surprising, thank God
I haven't run across it probably because it's in a different region
but Android
the marketplace is getting a few games
that are actually Trojan horses
that are letting
I guess malicious hackers
possibly use your phone as part of
a botnet
Apparently in China
on their app store, there's
I guess a few apps that are affected
by this. Monkey Jump 2
Sex Positions
President vs. Aliens
and
City Defense and
Baseball Superstars 2010
It says they found
these only right now on the Chinese app store
but they're saying that
it's possible that these may be coming
to the other regions
to just be on the lookout for them
It says
Although the intent of this Trojan isn't entirely clear
the possibilities range from setting up
a malicious mobile ad network
to creating an Android botnet
They said that
they're just kind of
watching out. It says possibly affected apps
could be posted to the app stores
targeting US users
in the future
so just
be on the lookout
I worry about
the day something like this happens to the iPhone
I mean Android's bad enough, there's enough people to use that
but boy oh boy when something like this
happens on iTunes
That's true
I mean everything does have to go through that rigid
approval process with Apple
but you just wonder when something's gonna slip through the cracks
It will eventually
Of course they can always pull it
once it gets out there
I heard about that
What was the one
something about baby
oh it was really bad, it was something like
punching babies or something and somehow it got approved
it was really terrible
Well some of you might feel a little terrible
about this and it's always interesting
to report on these type of like ROM
types of stories but there's a part of me that sits here
and goes okay seriously y'all this game
is like 20 plus years old
so let's talk about The Legend of Zelda
on the Famicom
or the Nintendo if you will
You know when it came out on the Famicom
it was actually a disc game
and we didn't have it here in the US but some of the games
for the original Japanese version
of the Nintendo ran on the
Famicom disc system
so they were like these little floppies
Well this week or I should say
over the holiday at least it did come to light that there was
a prototype of The Legend of Zelda
on one of these discs
so it was found and promptly uploaded
to the internet and you can check this out for yourself
it's a prototype of The Legend of Zelda
Here's the thing though guys
honestly when I kind of heard about this I was like oh that's neat
that there's a prototype out there for such a big game
but not that much changed
they changed some sprites
slightly
it's almost unnoticeable
how they changed some of these sprites
like some of the guys that bounce around
didn't have whiskers before and they do now
I mean there's really little stuff
very very minor floor plans
some reconfigurations
but of course if you're a hardcore Legend of Zelda fan
and if you grew up with this game
it's kind of neat to see what once was
so
what's that? I'm downloading it
of course you are
it is available on this website
called let's see
it was originally put on this forums
at lostlevels.org
which I think gets into a lot of these types of
prototype issues
and I guess there's more information available as well
on a website called the Cutting Room Floor
TCRF.net
which is a whole little like Wikipedia
type thing that will detail all of the changes
if you really want to know what rooms
led different rooms and how the item
drops were different. I mean they get into
the real nitty gritty about
this. Most people will just kind of go
eh, neat, couple things are different
so
you know again if you're going to download stuff like this
though you should consider you know at least owning
a legitimate copy of this be it through
Virtual Console or one of the
50,000 times Nintendo has released this
games be it in compilations or what
have you
but I say you know what
if as long as you have one of those
other games or you've had at some point in your life
I think you're entitled to take a peek at this
game.
Alright that is it for the
news tonight. We're going to open up the
Skype line. Woohoo! Let's get some calls
877-GAME-OLR or
our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
first calls of 2011 before
the delay is bigger tonight
so it's about a minute so do we have any
last minute stories while we wait for some calls to come in?
No but I was going to talk you were
asking about games that are good on the
marketplace and I was just pulling up some
that I thought might have been pretty good
one that I was really addicted
to Minor Dig Deep
was a really good one on the indie marketplace
and it's only a buck
this one looked kind of funny
Try Not To Fart
It looked awful. I saw the box art
for that like how exactly
do you not fart? I don't I think
it's button presses you have to mimic the button
presses but they have like you know
like different situations eating dinner
with like your girlfriend's parents
or you know wedding
I remembered one of the indie games
that I played that was really really bad
it was called Maids With Balloons
Oh I saw that! And it's
it actually has like live motion
video in it that they actually shot
like in some guy's spare bedroom and it starts
to look like a really really
bad homemade porno with
these three chicks and in
made costumes that really need to be dry cleaned
like just you know
like trying to be all like sexy and
so forth and
wow it was
it was kind of poop. Like I hate to
you know I know we're supposed to support indie
games and all that stuff but it's very
clear what this game is all about and it's
not the game. Sounds like epic fail
Yeah Insiders
Incite Lacrosse's college
was it College Lacrosse 2010?
That's a good one. Alright
let's get to the call. Hi you're on Orange
Laundry Radio who's this?
It's Ron and yes SSJ 100
Matt is correct I am the first one
of the year. You're the
first one of every goddamn show but you know what
here's what I say if you don't like Rama getting through
first every time they have Skype
on the iPhone you know
you can call us at Orange Laundry Radio we have a toll free number
for heaven's sakes there's plenty of ways
to get through to the show so if
you're the only one that wants to have your voice be heard
then so be it. What's on your mind tonight?
That and there are weeks when I let people
jump the line I don't even bother but
a couple of things
I'll be on my merry little way
now this whole court case
with the whole NFL thing I'm hoping
that the judge nullifies the contract
because damn it I want my tech mobile
NFL teams
Ah that would be nice you know I think
competition is sometimes a little bit healthy
you know what really frustrates me to no end about this
whole Comcast stuff is that
there's no real competition
in this area I mean I guess
we're starting to see more and more AT&T
U-verse and some people would tell
me oh well there's DSL and I'm
actually getting to the point where I don't care if
DSL is like a fourth as fast as
cable I'm gonna fucking switch
if they can't figure this problem out
you know what I mean? I hear you
DSL isn't as fast but it's just more
dependable more reliable I mean
that's part of the reason why I switched to fiber optic
I mean yeah I got I had
cable but you know what when the cable
modem goes out at 12
midnight during off peak hours
for 5-10 minutes at a time
I'm switching to something else
that's a lot better and besides
FiOS TV
pictures a lot sharper and a lot
cleaner than what cable vision was offering
I don't even really watch TV it's all about Netflix
and all that now but you know you live in New York
City too where you probably have more options
see being here in Sacramento
it's not that Sacramento doesn't have like you know
it's not like we're a potent town or one of the
I think what we're number 20 in the nation
or something like that but I live a little bit
on the outskirts of Sacramento so
I don't think I have as many options where I live
I hear where you're coming from
because where I am my options are either cable
vision or Verizon
you go in certain parts of New York City it's
either Time Warner or Verizon
and sometimes it's RCN or AT&T
it depends on where you go
big wang eater in our chat room is saying
fucking switch, switch bitch
I will switch to eating
big wang that's why I will switch to
how long ago did you switch to that?
you opened the door
I plead the fifth
I plead the fifth
well going back to the DSL
part of the reason the DSL is better than
cable is because with cable you're sharing bandwidth
with everyone on your block whereas
DSL just everyone in your house
it's a slightly more manageable situation
but yeah plus DSL
speeds are getting up to where they can compete
with cable's fastest speeds
first question I'm going to ask the DSL people is
can I play WoW on it?
that's all I want
and even with DSL speeds coming up
you have to pay more for it
but let's get back to gaming talk
yeah sorry
well hey it directly affects my games
it's not just WoW
it's Playstation Network and this whole
White Knight Chronicles being online enabled
I can't keep a connection
it's getting bad
anyhow
so what else is on your mind my friend anything else?
Arcade Infinity
now before we get into that
just so you know
Colt 45
is a malt liquor not a beer
so if you're going to pour a 40
you're pouring a 40 of malt liquor
you don't pour beer
beer is tasty malt liquor
not so much
that's why I said
an ice cold Colt
can is the same to me unless it's Guinness
but Guinness is better out of a bottle truth
true that true that
even better on tap
that's true more truth
so alrighty
Rama I'm going to go ahead and let you go
but wait actually one more question
because I'm going to ask this of all our callers tonight
your favorite game of last year using any
criteria you want there is no right or wrong answer
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World the game
because
it was the only game
I played more than any other game
of all of last year it just
brought me back to my favorite
beat em ups I mean this is a game
where people would just come over
it was like the number 2 game in my house next to rock band
I want you to get people together and have fun
this is like I felt like I was like 10
11 12 years old playing
playing this game you know
nothing's wrong with that fun is where it's at
got that right alright Rama you have a good one
we'll see you next time
877 game OLR
or our username on skype is orange lounge radio
give us a call we'll talk
SSG100 Matt
in our chatroom says Guinness is a meal really
well yeah I mean well it's liquid bread
I suppose you could look
at it that way there's no other last minute
stories in house we've got nothing but calls
to go on
well I was going to make more recommendations
sure give us a couple more while we wait for some calls
shoot one up
that's supposed to be a really good one
and that's pretty
cheap explosion aid
was another good one that was by the guys that did
weapon of choice and really
cool looking shooter game here comes a call
hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this
legend nazaku here hello my friend
how are you doing
doing pretty good what's on your mind buddy
nah I know
adam mentioned arcade infinity you probably already
covered this to death but
the way I see it is that
I'm surprised it managed to go this
long given
the fact that you know round
one pretty much was there
pretty much was the
was a death blow to them
and don't get me don't get me wrong with
round one at least they're like an authentic
japanese entertainment center to an
extent and they're
they do a lot better than d&b but
I don't know it's like the arcades are
pretty much dead at this point I hate
to say it they're dead they're just not
dying they're they're pretty much dead
it's funny you bring up d&b
because I was at dave and busters this week
and it's still it's still kicking there's still quite a
lot of corporate owned I'm
talking about like mom and pop
operations like arcade infinity
I gotcha
like those on their way out
the rest of them are pretty much on death row
unless of course you're in
you know you have foot traffic but
yeah it's a disaster state of affairs now
it just
you know it doesn't make sense when
you know
I get
the way no I get what you're
saying you know sadly it's one of those things where you know
yeah we covered the story here and it was kind of one
of those oh that's kind of
sad but it's also not surprising
I mean that's just you're right arcades
have been kind of going this way and there's
there's not been a lot that's really made us
have to go oh we've got to go to the arcade and have
that experience because now we have
the internet you know and
even it's it's so weird
because OLR started because
of arcade culture and
that couldn't happen today
and it's kind of sad
in a way but even our little
arcade culture has moved to the internet
in its own little way and it's not
like the internet didn't exist then because we used to have
our own little forums the sacramentals
were our little DDR team and so
forth which wasn't really a team it was just you know
kids that played DDR but
you know it wasn't
like what we have now with
Xbox Live I would
go so far as to say things like Xbox Live and
MMOs that's what really killed the arcade
right but then
again I've been hearing it
from other arcade owners that I know
that you know it's a dying industry
it's pretty much
on its days are pretty much numbered
and I know that I mean
somebody has to innovate somewhere
and of course I don't know what that answer is
or I'd be a freaking millionaire but
surely there is something where people
would want to do it in person you know what I mean
there's got to be something that will
get people I always want to do it in person
it's just you know
what I mean the folks who run
the classic arcades they're probably going to be
around for a while as long as that
as long as that generation of
folks who used to play those types
of older games even the newer ones
they'll still
be a place for those types of arcades
even ours even a place like
AI someone will
someone will step up eventually
and just you know pick up the torch
where they left off as well you know
as long as they're right as long as
they're like running a tight
ship I gotta say this
I gotta say this though too I mean let's be
real AI also
it was in kind of a shitty location
right round one it didn't
really have a lot of advertising
and I realized it was an independent thing but
unless you were kind of on the internet
I had no idea about this place
until I was like online and
posting on DDR boards
it's not even that I heard they were getting
flack from the city like they were
they were like really hesitant about
renewing their licenses wow
sad right and not a couple with
the fact that their landlord
you know raised their rent
constantly you know
raised their rent to the point where they were
gonna they had no choice but to be driven
out that you know and then round one
showed up so it was like so
many forces and the
they pretty much were
there were so many
aspects responsible for their demise
and it's like I don't
want to like clog up this precious Skype
time just debating it if you look on
those forums the fighting game forums
even your Bobani forums
you'll find the answers from people
who actually who have
more deeper knowledge than I do
that's what I hear let me ask you I've been asking
everybody else tends to wrap up and get more calls
what was your favorite game of all last
year any criteria you want uh
let me see
any criteria would that
be I'm thinking
I'm thinking bad company too
why is that because I think
just because of its crack like addictions like
especially the multiplayer
where it's all even though it's
team based it's just like on the PC
there's no ass hattery there's
like everyone helps everyone
fights no one quits
I wish there could be less ass
hattery in online games that is
one thing I would say Red Dead Redemption
but I just started that game a few days ago
that is one thing I will say that arcades
always kind of have over
uh the uh
online stuff is that online
you can hide behind your monitor but in
arcades if you're gonna be an asshole you have to be an
asshole to people's faces
that's one thing I do this at arcades
alright Zaku I gotta let you go so we can get more calls
have a good one buddy
I have a podcast where they discuss
the game but I haven't heard any of their shows
yet because I don't want to download iTunes
but um yeah I think yeah I've heard something like
that and uh my game of the decade is
Grand Theft Auto IV I think
that's just one of the best games ever made
in my opinion I don't
understand where all the hate for it came
from you know
no Loki would be right there with you buddy
Loki Grand Theft Auto IV game of the decade
possibly maybe
um it's pretty good
I don't know if I
yeah you had people complaining about the water
I think that was some of the best
computer generated water I've ever
slammed into the game and I can't believe people even
hated that I don't know it's just a weird
hate for that game I think when that's
like if you're complaining about the water
above everything else like really
that's kind of a stretch you know
I can think of games that have many more problems
than the water yeah they complain
about the water and the driving just because you couldn't
just you couldn't speed down uh
down the street at like 200
miles a minute you know
without uh you know they claim that
that was also a problem with the game I don't know I love the game
but anyway uh what else I want to get
to is arcades you asked about innovation
yeah and I think that uh
the way they'll probably be able
to save it is uh virtual reality
like some type of
apparatus that I know they already have something like that
but they need something where you'll have a
group of people that'll stand in it and there'll be some type of
multiplayer aspect I think that multiplayer
to the arcade will actually
be something that might be able to save it
so the holodeck
yeah yeah pretty much yeah the holodeck
that'll save
the arcades I think or maybe even
motion control I don't know
I find it kind of fascinating in a way that you're
calling in to talk about saving arcades and you
also kind of in the same sentence say
mag is the best game that you played last year
mag is very interesting
because it's it's
not an MMO
you can't really call it just some multiplayer online
game either it's like a
it's just it's a brawl
you know what I mean
yeah it's really great I mean
I think as far as
first person shooters go
that's the main reason why I like mag was just because
it was very innovative they were doing something
that you're not seeing in call of duty
that you're not even seeing in halo
and you know I just can't believe
how people just
knock any type of new innovation that comes out of
you know if the first person shooter is not call of
duty they knock it down
and you know
you know if the game is in
well what's the other big game that they
have out there that
people seen the
halo I'm drawing a blank
oh wow there you go yeah
if it's not wow it also gets shot down black ops
it's like you could only
yeah it's like you could only make those two games it's like you can only
make call of duty for shooters and you
could only make wow for
MMOs you know it's like the only
two games in existence in people's minds
I mean don't
get me wrong I like wow I think wow is great
but I've also played other MMOs
and I think you know they should also get
a chance you know I think they're
great games do you think there's a way
I'm just a gamer period do you think
there's a way to bring the magic of
mag and what makes that game exciting for you
to an arcade or do you think that
that 64 player brawl
experience is something you can really only do
online and only ever do online
I don't know you can bring something like
mag to an arcade
you couldn't have 128 people
versus 128 people but
you know you could probably have like a little
skirmish of like maybe
four people versus another four
people almost like a laser tag
you know what it could be
you could still use the internet in it
but it could be like city versus city
or something like that like you know
Sacramento local

joining us it's almost like you missed OLR
I'm very
very touched
I'm touched are you

I don't know if I'd go that far
Q100 Matt in our chat room says
people are doing that with Technica 2 now
they are battling with people for AZ
and CA see I like
where that's going that's a good start
unfortunately that's just one game
but alright
let's see let's go to another call here
this will be our last call tonight hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this?
hi this is Akdeft
hey Akdeft haven't heard from you in a long time
what's up?
nothing much you guys want to talk about
some games sure
what's up?
have you tried or have any of you tried
the
mexican wrestling game
AAA
I have not tried it
and I'm going to assume the other folks in the studio
probably haven't either but why don't you tell us all about it
I think if we knew more about it I think Dan would play it
well it's a
pretty interesting game
well basically
it's wrestling but
you have many
professional mexican wrestlers
and it's actually a pretty fun
game to play on multiplayer
is it like full on with all the theatrics
and masks and everything?
yeah oh that's awesome
yeah it actually
captures all the mexican
wrestling thing well
the action and all the
things that happen
on mexican wrestling the drama
yeah the drama
well basically
even the audience
plays a factor
well
plays in the game
not actually playing but
it plays a factor in the game
was this the game you were
telling us about previously that was actually developed in
mexico?
yes it was developed by
mexicans and columbians
I think
it was I think
published by konami
on the united states
awesome speaking of interesting
things published by konami I know this is
completely random but I have to get that out
at some point is that I was
at dave and busters over the weekend I think I mentioned
one of the things I played while I was there
it was a wheel of fortune ticket spitting
machine where you like guess the puzzle and everything
it was made by konami
couldn't believe it I didn't realize they had the license to do that
type of thing but they do a lot of arcade
stuff or uh redemption type of
things like slot machines and so forth
you said this was triple A
oh yeah
she's looking at a video here in the studio right now
of this game
yeah this
looks sick
triple A
or triple A
okay I think this
is immediately awesome
hmm
I'm just watching the intro of it that looks really cool
where's the gameplay okay I see that they
have some over the top wrestlers
oh it's the guy in the skeleton suit I love
that little creepy yeah he's called
la parka oh this is sweet
dark soccer is gonna be uh
getting her wrestling on okay
I actually like wrestling games believe it or not
cause I like customizing a wrestler
I think oh yeah
if you like wrestling games
you're gonna love this well we
used to get um all of
the uh the WWF or WWE
ones but cause the the big
thing about it is that because um
some of the publishing went overseas
is that they'd actually have some of the big moves from
some of the Japanese wrestlers
and we would you could
actually unlock like take all
these different parts and recreate
official you know Japanese wrestlers
in it and it was really awesome and
I remember okay do you remember WrestleMania
2000?
kinda for the Nintendo 64
yes I made this one
wrestler who was a
degeneration X guy and we had
him fight everybody and you know just
on like the watch mode and he beat everybody
including getting the women's belt
but
I also I like to do with those
games is just like make somebody and then just have
them go in watch mode on all of the
things I think that would be fun
alright Act F I got
one more question for you and that would be what was the
best game you played all last year using any criteria
you want?
I didn't play that many games this year
well last year
but I think what game that
I really found
interesting it was
it is
BB BB BB
or 6B
ah yes I heard you mention this in chat what was so great about it?
well it's actually
a pretty simple game
it's a simple platformer
though you control
you don't jump you don't
do any
spectacular thing like in Mario
or any platform like that
you control the gravity
you can go up or down
but you can't jump
or can't move
according to what you want to do
so you have to calculate
what you're going to do
if you're going to fall you have to
well
be very lucky or
some kind of
somewhat skilled
so you don't die because
many of the rooms are filled with spikes
that's why it's called
ah got it
interesting
it's also very cheap I think it's
$5 I think
and it's a pretty complete game
I think it's the best game
I played last year
simple jet innovative
alright great
I like hearing about some new games
and things that you know maybe some of the rest of us
missed so I think that's a great pick
alright buddy we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show
but thanks so much for your call
thank you take care
alright that's going to do it for the skype line tonight
thank you guys so much for calling
sorry to those that didn't get through

for like 5 minutes and then suddenly it's ringing off the hook at the end
please feel free to email us

more time and some more games in the future

before Arkham City comes out later this year
and I also wanted to try Transformers
War for Cybertron so I haven't gotten to that one yet either
I'll give you an assignment
for the next time you come on the show
at some point you got to find us that tabletop
game that you think is the most accessible to somebody
who's been playing the types of games

a challenge to say the least

better
