A popular PC game prepares for release on Xbox Live, more details come out about the next Elder Scrolls game, and EA prepares to disconnect the servers for several old games.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
We do tape live at All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern-ish, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show wraps up.
We really like Bobby because he always has us on our show and does this nice little transition and
Tonight we were talking about light-up cereal boxes, but before we get to yummy, delicious electrical cereal, let me introduce the cast and crew here at Orange Lounge Radio.
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm hungry.
What would you prefer, electric Trix or electric Honey Nut Cheerios?
Neither.
Why?
Because I hate both of them.
Well, what electric cereal would you like?
Frosted Mini Wheats.
Grape Nuts.
I adore Grape Nuts, but I'd have to say my favorite cereal of all time is Frosted Mini Wheats.
I'll get to my favorite cereal in a minute.
And yes, we'll talk about games too.
But say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
Hi.
Hi, how are you, Loki?
I'm fine.
I'm finishing my last piece of Honey Barbecue Chicken.
What was your favorite cereal growing up?
Honey Barbecue Chicken Nuggets?
Hell no.
Actually, you know, it's kind of funny.
I like both extremes of cereal.
Like, really bad for me cereal and really good for me cereal.
It's weird.
Like, I used to, and I still do, like Special K. Yes, the chick cereal.
I forgot about that.
That's one of the greatest moments of this show's history was when it came out that you enjoyed Special K. It's pretty good, actually.
It's not bad.
You know, Special K, I actually...
Captain Crunch
Really?
The one that is always last in the package for me is Lucky Charms.
I hate Lucky Charms.
And, well, Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
But here's the thing about Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
I hate it with milk.
So I have to eat it dry.
And it's just really, because all the cinnamon falls off.
I don't like cereal with milk at all.
I eat all my cereal dry.
Like, I know that's really weird to some people.
No, that's not weird at all.
But that's how I do it.
You know what the other one is really addicting?
What is it?
Golden Grahams.
Okay.
I can't stop eating that stuff.
Now you can't have a video game show and talk about cereal without bringing up Nintendo cereal.
Did anyone ever try that when they were younger?
I liked it.
I thought it was hideous.
Really?
I didn't mind it.
I thought it was pretty good.
I didn't like kid cereals.
I hated marshmallows.
I still hate marshmallows.
Nintendo cereal was closest probably to Froot Loops because I've soon remembered it was more like fruity and sugary.
I think that would be the taste it was close to.
Froot Loops weren't really big on my plate either.
I mean they were okay.
I just didn't like it.
I don't remember Nintendo cereal having marshmallows.
I don't think it did.
break into the shredded wheat.
I would say my favorite breakfast cereal of all time, and this might surprise some people, is Crispix.
Crispix is good.
I fucking love Crispix.
That's like half rice on one side, half corn on the other.
Oh, that stuff is good.
And gluten-free.
I don't know what it is.
It's amazing.
It's my favorite cereal.
It's not even a sugar candy cereal.
Damn, I need to get a box of that.
It's so good.
It's the texture.
It's so gross, but it's the truth.
I love putting Crispix and using my tongue to smash it to little bits.
I used to do that too.
Everybody does it.
It's just no one talks about it.
And then I would eat one half of one side And then eat the other half It's like eating an Oreo with no cream filling It's with milk filling I remember when they first brought Crispix out I mean, that was something that came out later on in my life
and DarkTetsuya in our chat room.
Of course, we have to introduce the chat room.
We love the chatters.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
DarkTetsuya wants to know, are there any cereal podcasts out there?
I don't know, but maybe we need to start one.
We'll have to look for one.
I don't know.
And many folks in our chat room agree.
Yes, there's one called the Ethereal Cereal Podcast.
Shut up.
Really?
I just found it.
Is it really about breakfast cereal?
That's what I'm going to find out.
All right.
Well, anyhow, we will talk plenty more about breakfast cereal.
There's one called Get Cereal.
Food and everything.
But we have to talk about our gaming weeks.
We've got to bring it back to video games.
It is a new year.
It's 2011.
Kind of a tiny, tiny lull in new games right now because everyone, I think, is catching up from last year's games.
But things are going to hit the ground fast.
LittleBigPlanet 2, I believe, is this week.
And that's just going to be the first in several huge, huge releases.
Oh, next week.
Loki's correcting me.
I knew it was January mid-somewhere.
But very soon that's going to come out and that's kind of the first of several bing bing bing big stuff coming up Oh yeah, DC Universe is this week, thank you Loki So I'm going to be quitting World of Warcraft When I played the beta on PC I had a good time with it So I never did get around to playing the PS3 one and they pulled the plug on it So I'm torn, I don't know if I really want to get into DC Universe or not But anyway, I guess we can talk about that later Let's talk about what's going on right now in your gaming week Dark Sakura, start us off
I hit level 63 right before the show.
Um, but this whole, like, like if you go listen to the last show on the feed right now, I'm pretty sure you were still hating on World of Warcraft and Razami for playing it.
So like podcaster only people have no idea that you have now leveled to 63.
Not last week.
Cause last week was after I got back from Washington.
No, the last show on the archives was.
Oh, on the archives.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Well, they, they changed enough in it that I was like, okay, I got it.
I got to give it a try.
Because, you know me, I'm not gonna bitch about something without having tried it myself.
Good.
I think that's a good thing to do.
I mean, and besides that, I just like fucking with you guys, you know?
No, I know, I know.
It's just like I mess with you for some of the things you like, but secretly it's alright.
Which, for the record, I haven't touched Second Life since the last time I said I haven't touched Second Life.
And for the record, Grape Nuts aren't so bad.
They're actually pretty good.
Grape Nuts are great.
They're great!
Anyway.
I, on the other hand, think Grape Nuts are nasty and you really shouldn't touch Second Life ever.
Some things never change on this program.
So anyway, anyway.
I, well, okay.
I know last week live I, you know, mentioned that I had really hurt my lower back.
It's technically my right hip.
Really bad.
I sprained my hip.
Although it's more funny to say I sprained my butt because really it's,
You broke your butt.
But I've been seeing my chiropractor.
I have one more appointment to go to and it still hurts but it's not nearly as the debilitating pain I was in before.
So all I could do is just sit here on an ice pack and play World of Warcraft because what else was there for me to do?
I've done everything in Star Trek Online and I still love Star Trek Online so much but all I was doing was freaking playing Dabo.
And there's only so much gambling one can do.
I really like this point in our chatroom here from Salacious Pop.
In my opinion, this just proves that Blizzard properly redid the experience in Kata, which was the point.
1-60 was still from 2004 and shitty.
If Jamie likes it now, then they really gave it an overhaul.
Yeah, well, and now Dan was like, oh, they dumbed it down for people so that people can, you know, have a more rewarding experience and blah, blah, blah.
And I was like, you know, when I first, when I first, first started playing, this was, you know, when I got Burning Crusade, when it was new, ooh.
It was like, okay, I've done everything.
I'm not going anywhere.
I've done all this.
I'm not going anywhere.
Fucking boring.
Same gameplay over and over and over and over and nothing interesting.
And I think that's a big part of the change, too.
I don't want to go too far into this because, again, we have the separate Warcraft show now because we talk too much about it on this show.
But it's important because where Warcraft goes, like it or not, it is the biggest MMO right now.
The rest of the industry will follow Warcraft.
with some exceptions, which we'll get into even later in the show.
But my point, in old Vanilla WoW, a lot of the quests were fetch me animal pelts, kill X number of monsters.
And they still have a lot of that.
And there is a lot of that, but they've also mixed in a lot of more interesting technology from the newer expansions, like vehicle stuff from Rapid Lich King.
Use this item to scrape tar off this creature's ass.
Yes, things like that.
You know what I'm talking about too, don't you?
No one, because I haven't done that quest.
But did you get to dig through the poop for the key?
No.
That quest I did.
I did see the one.
Okay, now Tiara showed me this one.
It was where you go to, oh crap, what's the, not the Outlands, but the place where everything's red?
That has the big scar?
Baron's?
Badlands.
Okay.
Because keep in mind, I'm still learning what everything's called.
And you run into a gnome, a dwarf, and something else.
A pizza place?
No.
I see what you did there.
It's not a setup for a bad joke.
The dwarf is like, I went up to Deathwing and I punched him in the face!
I got on my motorcycle and picked up some hot babes, and we had a tender moment.
Oh, that's the one where one of the hot babes is a blood elf male.
I remember that.
Alright, I've seen that.
Good times.
But basically they were all telling tall tales and it was really funny.
It was cute.
So that's what I like is that there's a lot more comedy thrown in there.
It's like the quests have names that make me laugh my ass off.
And I'm still pissed off at that stupid dragon for setting the world on fire and not setting me on fire.
Stupid fucking dragon.
You were online with me for this.
I was.
And you're like, I'm standing in the fire and not dying.
What is wrong?
I took a screen capture of me in the fire not dying.
I wanted the damn achievement.
And then I got achievements that you don't have.
Whatever.
Thanks to X-Link.
No one, Kerr.
All right.
What else besides WoW have you been playing?
Well, also, thank you for the thing that you sort of were in on.
You're welcome.
I got 800 gold.
I'm gonna go buy me a bird.
No, I was playing other stuff, though it was really solitaire.
And Mushihime-sama!
Because that game is crack.
I tell you, cave fans, if you want a little fun, it's still bullet hell.
It's just bullet hell with running.
And, like, you target stuff, and then you let your things fall, but you still have to avoid the bullet.
It's bullet hell.
It's bullet hell on feet.
Well, hell.
It's great.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
It was okay.
I played a few different things this week.
I played The Flying Hamster, which is pretty awesome.
It was a game that was a PSP Mini at one point, and they just brought it over to the iOS platform, and it's kind of a shooter game where you play a chibi flying hamster who has to save his hamster girlfriend or something like that, and it's a shooter, and it's really hard, actually, but it's all chibi, and it's kind of cool.
So I played that.
And then, uh, more Sword and Poker 2.
I'm actually almost done with that game.
I'm in the last dungeon, and I'm maybe six floors in, so that's pretty cool.
Um, what else did I play?
I think I played a little bit more, uh, Cannonbolt, which is fun.
Um...
Oh yeah.
And then, more Grand Theft Auto.
But finally, after working on it for six months, we got our new modded games running again.
And I tell you, that first game...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Aren't having as much fun as they could be having because I usually am kicking the crap out of them.
Whereas the mod games, everybody has fun and it's just so over the top.
I was hysterically laughing throughout the whole game because all this crazy shit was happening.
It was awesome.
I'm looking forward to playing more of that.
This time though, we hot swapped all of our drives so we don't get banned.
So our consoles don't get banned this time.
I'm pretty fast at it now.
I can hot swap a console in about 15 minutes.
It's like field stripping a gun or something.
It's pretty quick.
So yeah, I played that.
Actually looking forward to playing some new games soon.
I'm going to pick up LittleBigPlanet.
I have the collector's edition on order because I want those bookends and the little stuffed plush sack boy for my desk.
And then...
Actually, that's probably going to be the newest thing I'm going to play for a while.
I am going to actually finally update my console now that certain hacks have come out that allow custom firmwares and whatnot.
On any firmware console.
You want to get Linux on your good old PS3 again, huh?
I don't really want even Linux.
And here's the thing is I had the opportunity to actually mod my console to where I could pirate games on it.
But I just didn't want to pirate games on the PS3.
And that's saying something.
and it's not a good something alright let's see moving on to my gaming week sadly I don't have a lot of new new stuff to report I haven't had a lot of money to buy a lot of extra games lately so it's mostly the same stuff I was talking about last week with Fallout 3 and continuing on White Knight Chronicles a little more although I have to admit the online stuff still doesn't make sense to me but whatever at least my internet is somewhat cooperating so I can keep a connection to PlayStation Network now
so that's nice so I guess I'll dip in a little bit and talk about some iPhone games that I've checked out recently one of them that I think you guys would like and this was something that was somebody had shouted out to me on Twitter and I so apologize because I forgot who sent this to me on Twitter but it's a game called VGMC or Video Game Music Challenge and it's free on the App Store and all it is is it plays like theme songs from old school video games and you're given like
I'm going to try Paperboy.
Correct!
Here's another one.
Mario 3, right?
Yeah.
So that probably doesn't pick up on the speed review, so I apologize.
It's all kind of mid-ied.
A little bit, yeah.
It's not like the original, original stuff, but it's all mid-ied.
But hey, it was free, so I think that's kind of cool.
I did play that too, I forgot.
Did you?
Yes.
Yeah, it's cute.
I like that.
So that was a fun one.
I played a little bit of Cut the Rope, the holiday edition, which is this really popular iPhone game, is Cut the Rope.
But I'm cheap, and I like to have a lot of the free demos before I buy games, and so they have this holiday edition that's free.
And it's basically a puzzle game.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
for money and it's like it's too hard to just get in there and like play a game the interface is shit I'm sorry I don't have a nice way of saying it like they have just destroyed the game because they're trying too hard to build this music store around it and I don't need all this I don't really like all this other bullshit like OpenFaint and I don't even like Game Center and some of this other stuff like I really wish there was just one for all of it and to be honest I honestly
As much as I like OpenFaint and what it's trying to do, we need one standard across all the iPhone games.
And I think Apple ought to just step in and say, it's Game Center and get the fuck out.
We're going to stop approving your apps if it has any other shit in it.
I know that's a terrible thing to say because Game Center is the worst of all of them, but maybe they can work with the OpenFaint people.
I don't know.
But I think it's ridiculous that you have all these different games and they have all these different add-ons.
They should just buy and absorb OpenFaint.
or something.
I don't know.
So there's a lot of people that are going to really hate that I said that but it's just annoying.
I kind of don't like either of them though.
I hate all these freaking pop-ups when I start games.
Sign up for OpenFaint.
Sign up for this network.
No!
I have an iPhone so I don't have to play with other people.
You know?
Yeah.
So.
Hey, let your friends on Twitter and Facebook know that you're playing another fake game.
I will post on Facebook if I want them to know I'm playing this game.
It's getting to be too much.
I want a Facebook update every time I score a point.
No, no, no, no.
And then, believe it or not, I downloaded Smurf Village on the iPhone.
It's stupid.
It's a Facebook game.
If you like those Facebook grindy games, then have fun.
I prefer Knights of the Clicky on Facebook, which, by the way, I got Extover to play, or he played it.
I don't know, because he heard one of us talking about it, and he said it was the worst thing he'd ever played in his life.
Night of the Crystal
Yeah, you kind of echo a lot of people that are kind of done with Knights of the Clicky.
Like, once you beat that final boss, you can kind of grind old quests and stuff, but there's not a lot else to do.
Now, they did just recently release... I can't believe I'm talking about a Facebook game.
We really do need... They released some new levels.
We really do need an official Knights of the Clicky starring Clicky the Pen.
Yeah.
A different show on the network owns the rights to that character.
So you'll have to get agreements and contracts.
You know, I haven't gotten to the last boss because I actually have been going through for gold mastery on other levels.
Oh, wow.
And now I'm like, this is boring.
What the crap am I doing?
I'm done.
Some comments in our chat room.
Some talk about Steam and Apple.
William Murderface says Apple needs to get in bed with Steam already.
No.
Actdeft says Apple kind of already did that.
That's when Portal came out for free.
And that's true.
Steam is on the Apple system now.
Yeah, it's good for them, but I mean, no.
Apple doesn't need to buy Steam.
There was some other big news in the
Anyhow, let's move on into some housekeeping tonight.
No show stuff as far as I know, although I will say it looks like we can kind of project now when episode number 400 will be, although we have yet to plan anything special for it.
But if tonight is episode 396, then 397, 398, 399, episode number 400 of Orange Launch Radio will be February 6th of this year, assuming we do not miss any shows between now and then.
Or do not have a show at 3.99 and a half
I'm sure some daily ones have, but I don't know about any other weekly shows.
So if there are, I don't know of them, which would be a surprise at this point because that means you have to be doing a show for at least eight, nine years like we have.
So yeah, we'll be kind of doing something a little special for episode 400.
We just don't know what yet.
In good OLR fashion, we're procrastinating.
Otherwise, you can join us on Facebook.
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
How about another marathon episode?
You like those, right?
I'm not working.
Or Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.
How about we get into some gaming news?
Loki, start us off tonight with some gaming news.
Yes, so of course there's some information, I mean, slightly before when the US announcement and stuff comes out on the 19th, but some stuff about the 3DS launch in Japan.
They've announced 10 titles that are going to be expected for launch.
I guess the Japanese launch date will be February 26th.
And the titles you can expect...
Winnie11 3DS, Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition, Samurai Warriors Chronicle, Tobidasu Puzzle Bobble 3D, Nintendogs Plus Cats,
Wow, they're going to do three versions of that too Toy Poodle and New Friends French Bulldog and New Friends and Sheba and New Friends Yes, I will not be stupid this time and buy all three versions Actually, I'll be smart this time and not buy any version Ridge Racer 3 I don't know, I kind of want the kitties I want the kitties too
Ridge Racer 3D, Combat of Giants, Dinosaur 3D, and Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle.
So those are expected out.
Also it says there's supposed to be some new titles announced as well, including BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2.
and ports of Tales of the Abyss and Raving Rabbids Travel in Time, as well as the third game in the Tank Beat series.
So those are going to be some launch titles.
No real word on what the pricing is going to be over here yet, but in Japan it looks like they're kind of ranging around, looks like 4,980 yen to say about...
6,090 yen.
So between, say, $60 and $73.
Obviously, it's a lot more expensive over there.
I was going to say, there's got to be... They're not going to be $70 games.
They're not going to be $70 games here.
But they'll be more expensive than DS games, won't they?
They will be more... They'll use the 3D thing as an excuse to charge a $10 premium.
They will.
I've already said before that one of the launch titles I've seen actually have an actual price to it is $40 retail.
So...
D.S.
Games
There have been one or two $40 retail games, but I'm expecting probably a $10 increase.
You're probably going to see everything from $40 to a $50 as a high-end game, would be my guess.
and then of course there's some more information regarding the battery life for the 3DS they're saying that the 3DS has a 3-5 hour battery life for playing 3DS games of course it's going to be a little bit longer if you're playing regular DS games which is going to be 5-8 hours and they're saying that's probably because it doesn't have to run the third display since the two displays are interlaced on the top screen um
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Samurai Warriors Chronicles Dead or Alive Super Monkey Ball
So where's the hype at right now?
Because let me go to a comment in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Defective Candy in our chatroom says, I love Nintendo, but I'm just not going to invest in a 3DS when it comes out.
I'm going to wait until they release a second version just to make sure all the bugs are worked out.
And I think that's a good question to ask.
Where's the hype meter now for the 3DS?
Because are you guys interested in buying one now?
Or are you kind of where Defective Candy's at?
Where you're like, you know what?
There is always inevitably the GBA with the backlight, the DS Lite, the second iteration of the handheld that comes out later.
Yeah, but here's the thing with me and the DS Lite and all that stuff.
I didn't really care about the DS Lite.
I guess the only iteration would be the DSi that was slightly different where they actually had SD storage and the cameras on it and stuff like that.
That's a little different.
I don't know if you'd even consider that a different system almost, but it pretty much was.
um sadly it won't ever be utilized and remember they're going to be having dsi only games and there was a handful of those but they're kind of crap a lot of them were crap it was just unlock extra stuff that there's really no reason we shut out of the regular ds version exactly um so
I don't know.
I'm actually planning on getting one at launch.
They haven't announced any launch titles yet, but I know one of the titles that they were working on that was supposed to be for the 3DS was the new Excite Truck game.
I'm telling you, if they have a new Excite Truck game at launch, I will not be able to resist.
No, but I am planning on getting one at launch.
And just because I don't really care about the reiterations that come out later on, unless they add major features to them, it doesn't really matter to me that they shrink down the size of the system, or they make the system bigger, or they have a different color.
I don't care.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So here's and I'm really gonna make myself sound like an a-hole by saying this but here's where I'm coming from that a lot of you aren't coming from.
I've seen the 3DS and I've played the 3DS and like I swear I'm not saying that to be a jerk but I'm telling you I'm saying that because when you see this technology for the first time and you're like I'm looking at 3D with no glasses and
and DarkSakura.com
I gotta say, I really want one.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Ooh, touchpad.
You're really catching up with everybody.
Well, I don't want to sound like a broken record on this show, but I always think the PSP's strength was not just as a gaming system, but as a comprehensive multimedia device.
But they're really kind of expensive.
And that's what the 3DS doesn't have.
I don't look at the 3DS going, I'm going to be able to browse the web in 3D.
No, I'm not.
but they're saying though that for example they were talking at CES during their keynote that they're having Sony tablets they didn't really come out and say the PSP phone but they're going to have the PSP phone they're going to have the PSP 2 probably at some point soon so I don't think they really care too much the fact that they can do all this stuff because pretty much everything now is doing all that stuff you can browse the web with any device almost
Except the DS.
Well, I guess you can.
Just not well.
All right.
Let me go to the chat room at chat.orangelearn.com because there's some interesting discussion going on here that I want to bring up.
Gamer Girl kind of started the thing off by saying, I hate 3D.
I can't watch that shit.
And Solar Flare says, 3D is a fad.
And CSCRSMAT454, sorry, I don't know what the preferred name is there, wait for a price drop.
Hmm.
Well, here's the thing.
Can I say this real quick, though?
I also think I'm getting a little sick of the whole 3Ds in the movie thing because I think most movies don't benefit from it.
Tron sure did.
Yeah, but then I'm like, but Tron was actually really awesome in 3D.
I thought Avatar was great in 3D.
You know, and it's so difficult.
But I think there's too much.
Like, Gulliver's Travels 3D, no thanks.
Not gonna bother.
Do not want.
But even something like Tangled was really cute.
Here's the thing though, Gulliver's Travel is not a movie targeted at you, Rob.
It's targeted at little kids that like Jack Black.
Well, it missed its target because it didn't do very well at the box office.
Well, that's the thing.
It's a gamble.
I mean, that's something... Jack Black does not put people in the seats anymore.
I don't know, but it's...
Speaking of which, I am going to sneak out to the theaters to see Tron one last time.
In D-Box.
In D-Box.
We need to go.
Because Friday, the 14th, is the last day that they will have... Actually, no, that will be the cutoff because they're going to be getting the new D-Box movie, which is...
Thanks for watching!
And I was very skeptical going into the 3DS, but seeing that technology for the first time without the glasses was pretty amazing.
And I have to admit, my favorite part, and this is something the movies don't give you, my favorite part was that there's a little slider where you can adjust the intensity of the 3D.
So it can be like, you know, kind of pulling on the eyes to, forget it, 2D.
Just throw the 3D out and have 2D.
So it's interesting to me that developers are going to have to consider that, that some people are going to want to play 3D, some want to play 2D.
I the reason why I'm excited about the 3D I want to see where it's going to take games because you know things like Doom, Quake, even things like Zelda when they first came out they were called 3D games this whole virtual reality and I think now that we have real 3D technology I'm really curious to see where that's going to take the gaming and interaction technology that's where I'm at
Sorry, Loki, I cut you off like five minutes.
Well, and then on the other thing is they don't have to necessarily use the 3DS top screen as a 3D screen.
They can use it as an HD 2D screen because you have twice the resolution now to play around with.
They don't have to actually interlace it to do 3D.
So I think there's a lot of potential to do some really good looking games.
And the games on it look really good.
I mean, like the...
We'll see.
I'm curious to know more details about what the US is getting.
I was very surprised to hear that there is no pack-in at all.
And we haven't heard what the new Mario game is going to be.
Can you imagine a new Mario game on this?
That would be sexy.
I also do have to mention that for the people in the chat room who are pissing about 3D, if you don't like it, don't see it.
Well, true.
But, you know, I did ask the question, who's going to buy this and who's not?
And so, if they're not, that's fine.
But I'm saying, you know, for the people who are just saying 3D is overdone, 3D is overdone, if you don't like it, fine.
Don't ruin it for the people that like it.
I don't, you know, that's this thing.
If you don't want your games in 3D, don't buy a 3DS.
If you don't want your movies in 3D, don't go see them in 3D.
If you don't want to watch TV in 3D, don't get a 3D TV.
It's that easy.
Stop bitching.
3D is slowly becoming the norm
But otherwise, everybody's talking about 3D, 3D, 3D TVs, 3D TVs without glasses, 3D... 3D's not going anywhere.
It's going to be around for a while, and it will become the norm, and people will just stop bitching about it.
It's not a fad, but yes, just like... So I can see where people are concerned about that.
But just like any emerging technology, just like with, you know, the Wii and stuff like that, the first, you know, the first games you have on the Wii or whatever are gonna be really cheesy and they're gonna be just some cheap ideas to utilize the technology.
Just like the first 3D movies, you know, there's a couple good ones and a lot of them were just tacked on 3D to get people in the seats because it's a 3D movie.
But a lot of stuff now, a lot of movies are being filmed in 3D.
Granted, you're not gonna see, you know,
I don't know, Sister of the Traveling Pants 3 in 3D God, let's hope not But I think eventually everything will be in 3D And that's just going to be the way it is And then when you're talking to your kids about how you used to see the 2D movies They're like, 2D?
What are you talking about?
What is 2D?
And that's the time when the 4D dimension will be coming out And you can watch movies in an alternate time
This is my issue is that people bitched about TV when it was new.
People bitched about HDTV.
People bitched when it was time to go from 8-track to cassette.
Or VHS to DVD.
Exactly.
It's the same thing over and over.
And it's just sort of like a big inevitability.
Technology is going to progress.
I gotta play devil's advocate.
None of those technologies hurt my eyes.
That's the one downside I can see to this 3D.
Yeah.
Like, even when I go to do the 3D movies and so forth, like, I can't wear the glasses for the whole two hours consecutively.
Yeah, but you know why, though?
That's because the technology that they have right now, there's a lot of flicker and just... But they're gonna catch up.
It's... The technology will get better and it'll be less harsh on your eyes.
Okay, that's fair.
Well, I mean, think about this.
Alright, look at televisions in the 80s.
Okay.
Remember those big, you know, cabinet televisions that would have that, you know, look like, oh, they're supposed to be nice furniture and shit.
A really blurry screen quality.
Now we've got TVs that are three times those size in perfect crystal clear HD quality.
And we're talking about a span of 25 years.
So... So by the time I'm 50, the holodeck should be out, right?
No, I'm not saying that.
But now also...
But if you think about it too, the growth of technology is also exponential.
The more technological advancement you get in the different fields, they're going to speed up the new rate of research.
The more you learn, the more you're going to learn.
That's how I see it.
Two very interesting comments in chat.
I gotta bring up.
Bochikawa in our chatroom says, Besides, we're still playing games on the NES.
If you want new, then get new.
If you want old, play old.
Interesting.
Seriously.
That's what we do.
We've got a whole room full of old.
And it's not to say that all technologies end up taking off.
Old is new.
Look at how much retro crap gets repackaged and comes out.
You know what I mean?
That's because all the kids have grown up and are making the games.
Fascinating.
Can you believe...
And I don't know if this is on our show or not, but can you believe that copies of Super Mario All-Stars, the reprint that was on the Wii, are selling for $75 and $80 on eBay?
Yeah.
Are you people fucking nuts?
Let me bring this up in chat as well because this is another good comment.
And then I promise we can change the topic.
Mayor in our chatroom says, why now versus the last 3D?
And I think that's a very legitimate question.
And I'm guessing a lot of it has to do with the technology.
The last time 3D was big was the mid-early 80s when JAWS 3D was out and that stuff.
And I'm thinking...
There's two reasons for it.
A, that technology wasn't as good, period.
I mean, when you're talking to 3DS, again, I'm telling you guys, the first time you see it without glasses, you do have that moment of, whoa, everybody's going to have that moment of, whoa, I'm playing this and I'm not wearing glasses and I'm seeing the 3D.
And then B, Jaws 3D was not Avatar.
And love Avatar or hate it, the fact is it's the highest grossing movie ever.
And now everybody wants to be it.
Those are the two big differences to me.
Technology has come a long way and a movie got to be extremely successful with the technology.
Let me tell you that Avatar didn't make its money because people liked the plot.
They wanted to see the pretty 3D.
Well, but if you also look into the actual technology that went into it, it's basically, and I think they applied some of it to a lesser extent in Tron, remember, with having the 3D modeled younger face, even though he looked like plastic.
That technology still needs some work.
But I think what they needed was better animation.
That's what I think that that needed.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
For example, I'll use Tron since I was already on it.
In the first Tron movie, when he walks into the cubicle area and there's cubicles going on for miles, that was on matte painting.
Or remember V when they walked into the ship and it's the whole lines of the storage pods going on in the back in the old one.
That was on matte painting.
My favorite was always rear projection for driving scenes.
Yeah.
yeah but now if you look at that you're gonna I don't think that the craftsmanship is going anywhere it's just moving to a different medium you're still gonna have to have animators you're still gonna have to have artists that are gonna be able to make all of this and yeah maybe you're saving in resources and paint and that type of thing and keep in mind I still think nothing will replace painting nothing will replace physical art you know what I mean
But at the same time, I think that if you're looking in terms of pushing the envelope as far as the experience that you can deliver in technology, in a cinematic experience, or in games or movies, anything like that, that you're going to have to start making situations where it's cheaper to produce.
And I think that that's going to be the advantage of going with the same type of innovations that they made with Avatar.
That's what my point was, is the fact that you could have...
and then send it off to a team of animators and have this high quality product produced with some time and effort but you're not paying for a set.
You're not paying for makeup.
None of that.
That was my point.
That's where I see everything going with the technology developed with that.
Yeah, cool movie.
But I think that they need to take the same things.
Keep in mind, they could even do the same thing with video games.
We've had motion capture in video games before.
So keep in mind taking that same sort of...
you know the blank set you can actually do all of your cinematic cutscenes with like actual actors and record them real time have them you know the layers and everything put over it for a game and boom there you go
Let me try to wrap up this topic by going back to one other thought.
and DarkSakura.com.
All these launch games are kind of like that obvious thing to do the technology.
All the Kinect launch games were essentially Wii knockoffs and Dance Central.
You know, all the 3DS things are these, you know, Nintendo upgrades and sort of like, you know, finally Kid Icarus coming back and so forth.
I'm really curious now what is going to be next now that these technologies are established how are you going to take it to the next level what is that must have game going to have in it that implements that technology that just blows us away so I'm really interested in what's going to be brought to the table this year at E3 and it's either going to be great or it's going to show that you know what we should have never left where we were last year
DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
They are now doing the whole, I hate the word term, microtransaction, because a transaction is a transaction.
Fuck putting a size on it.
But they're using this little, you know, and I can see doing it.
I've been doing some of them in Star Trek Online when I was playing.
I bought outfits and shit packs and stuff, even with my subscription fee.
So I can see that if someone wants to, you know, make, you know, a character look a certain way, they're going to spend all the little bits and pieces and not even see that they're nickel-diming their money right into their pocket.
and I've always said the minute this technology comes out for World of Warcraft, Horde House is over, I'm quitting WoW.
The minute this type of stuff, and you might already say, oh Rob, you can already do it, the mounts, that's all superficial crap.
And you know, it does not affect the base game.
When this becomes their model.
Exactly.
If Warcraft ever implements this stuff where the stats change or you're getting things that otherwise you'd grind dungeons for or whatever, Horde House is cancelled and WoW is done.
I like playing a game where everybody's on an equal playing field.
Everybody's paying $15 a month.
Everybody is on that same playing field when it comes to the quests that you're grinding and so forth, and those that get the super awesome items really worked for it.
However, that's not to slam this other idea because, you know, not everything can be wow and not everything can kind of command the $15 up front.
And I think we've seen a lot of the same model, oddly enough, in Facebook games and it's worked really well.
I don't know.
These games, I'm okay with the way they do it because it's sort of like, well, you know nothing in this world is really free.
So that's how they choose to nickel and dime you instead of the cost of the game.
And so, I don't know, for some reason, I'm okay with it.
But at the same time, I can't think of any free-to-play games that I really play with any regularity except one or two Facebook games.
That even then, if they were to disappear and delete tomorrow, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.
well you keep in mind too that a lot of like remember when I was playing Ragnarok online a lot of the free servers that I would play on they would actually make the money to run the servers by offering special items for people who donated and you know that's been going on for years Second Life that's how they run you know you pay real money for stuff that people have made and
That's how you do your thing there.
I think that it's just now they're saying that when you don't notice how much you're spending, that it's easier to spend a lot more.
If that makes sense.
Absolutely.
That's gambling.
There's a lot of that.
And on top of that, you're not dealing with actual physical money.
You're dealing with a click yes.
There's no money leaving your hand, but it's relieving your bank account.
Yeah.
It could be dangerous.
When Xbox Live first came out, I bought every single arcade game that came out.
Freaking iTunes.
Yeah, iTunes is easy to fall into that too.
Same thing.
Oh yeah.
So, anyway.
Good talks tonight.
Speaking of Xbox Live... Keep a ledger by your desk when you play.
For real.
All right, Loki, what's up next in the news for us?
All right.
Oops.
Anyways, this is kind of cool.
They're doing a new promotion.
Well, it's kind of something that they've been doing each year for Xbox Live Arcade, the house party.
Well, this time they've got a lineup of games coming up.
It's actually pretty cool.
There's going to be five games that will start coming out on February 18th each week.
And it's going to include the following titles.
Beyond Good and Evil HD.
Hardcore Uprising.
That's that Contra game that's kind of anime style now.
Bejeweled Blitz Live.
Full House Poker Torchlight Xbox Live Arcade
I am so excited about Torchlight coming.
It's going to be sweet.
But it's going to be weird because Torchlight is very PC.
You know what I mean?
And if you've never played it, it's basically Diablo 2.
I don't know how else to explain it.
It's a lot of that same kind of like dungeon crawl and lots of keys do different things.
And I think they've talked about with this coming Xbox Live Arcade, they've practically revamped the whole battle system.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
But at the same time, they're going to kind of trick me into buying the same game twice because I have it on PC and now I kind of want it on Xbox Live Arcade.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Exactly.
I've been tricked into buying this game twice.
What about you, chatters?
Any of you guys play Torchlight on your PC and yet you think you're going to buy this on Xbox Live Arcade as well?
That's what I'm curious about.
What were some of the other games that were coming out?
It's all Torchlight Torchlight to me.
But Jewel Blitz Live.
They have that.
That game's free to play on Facebook.
They're going to charge me to play it on Xbox Live?
Yes.
Bastards.
Beyond Good and Evil HD.
I know a lot of people are Beyond Good and Evil fans.
Yeah, that'll be a big one.
What else?
Oh, there's that new poker game.
That was from Microsoft.
Oh, that's the one versus 100 replacement, isn't it?
Yes.
Yes.
Bochikawa in our chatroom says, Torchlight with Kinect support?
That might be really fun.
I don't think it uses Kinect.
I don't think so either.
That's an interesting thought, though, is that what if instead of a mouse, it was your hand?
And you could just move your hand around and click by, like, just thrusting your hand forward or something?
I don't know.
It'd be interesting.
Dartetsuya reminded us that Diablo was on the PlayStation.
Look at how Diablo worked on the PlayStation.
They just changed the controls to work with a controller.
Activision Blizzard, and Zynga
What do these two companies possibly have in common where they're both being sued?
Well, Walker Digital, which was founded by Jay Walker, who also made Priceline.com, is behind this suit.
So maybe it's not just any old troll.
This is a troll with a big website.
Zynga and Activision violate the patent, which is a database-driven online distributed tournament system.
Walker is saying that the part of this that has been violated is the part of the patent that says there is a quote method of conducting a distributed electronic tournament for a plurality of players and World of Warcraft, Call of Duty Black Ops which is Activision which is part of Blizzard, Mafia Wars and all these games have these tournaments in them
Kind of odd that StarCraft isn't mentioned because when I think tournaments, I don't think WoW, I think StarCraft, but whatever.
I guess violates this patent.
I don't know, I'm starting to think with all these stories I read that patent stuff is a need for reform.
I think whatever judge reviews that needs to just tell him to bite his ass.
Well, and it probably will get laughed out of court, as a lot of these recent ones have.
But they're asking for a full trial or whatever.
And you know what?
If this guy had the technology years ago or whatever, that's fine.
If you were the one that thought of it, I guess, although I somehow don't think these companies have implemented it quite the same way.
And just the fact that...
Why do you patent something and then do nothing with it?
That's what bothers.
That's what makes you look like a troll, is you're just waiting for someone to actually put a good idea to use, and then you get to sue the pants off of them.
I don't know.
A little silly to me, and I'm sure it's a little silly to all of you as well.
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
Oh, I've got a few other things.
How about Mario All-Stars?
Well, it sold out.
And copies are going for $80 on eBay.
And they're talking about more reprints.
So we might be seeing it going.
However, they have not sold out in the UK.
And you can still get your copy on Amazon UK for $17.99.
So people in Europe, stockpile.
Because we're coming after your supply.
And people here in the US, you're going to be really sorry buying these for $80 on eBay if they end up reprinting them, which they probably will.
Well, yeah, I mean, basically, Mark Franklin, who's the head of Nintendo PR, said that they're thinking about bringing it back in reprints.
So they definitely want to make more money, and people will buy them.
The market's there.
And I'm sure there's got to be a lot of us sitting here going, who is buying this?
Because seriously... It's a port of a game that was out on the SNES.
I mean...
Well, here's this.
Dan turned to me a while back and said, Hey, you want this game?
Why?
We've got it on the SNES.
I mean, I think we were talking about wanting the special edition or something because it came with shit, but why?
I guarantee that you can buy a Super Nintendo and the game for less than $80.
Oh no, I'm sure you can.
The game is easy to find.
I mean, it wasn't like of super limited production or anything, but you can find them.
Most people don't understand that.
I think I've got two copies.
It's the Wii.
If I have another copy, I'll send it to somebody.
I know this is hard for people that listen to this show to understand because you all are very gaming aware.
You're culturally aware of the gaming community.
I think there's a lot of people out there that honestly don't understand that.
they don't think you can buy Super Nintendos anymore or they think that well it's on the Wii it's a Wii version it's different no it's not they don't know that
All they know is that the game is on the Wii now.
We are expert analysts of video games.
Trust us.
It's the same thing.
It's like when they re-released The Wizard of Oz into theaters for a limited run.
It's the same damn movie.
They didn't put anything back.
Dorothy suddenly does not go home.
You know what I mean?
She still clicks her heels three times.
That'd be fucking hilarious.
Change the ending.
But no, the movie is still the same.
You know what I mean?
Nothing's changed.
They changed the ending and she's actually in the insane asylum like in the second movie.
I honestly truly think people don't know that you can go out and still buy the game.
They think that, oh, they've re-released this now and I can get it on my Wii for my kids.
They should be listening to our podcast.
Why aren't they?
and some folks in the chat room seem to agree with me.
Tigerclaw says, true, and people who never bought a Mario game in their life, this will be their first entry to Mario.
DDRDollarBill says, here's the thing, casual players aren't going to go out and find a Super Nintendo and then find the games.
They don't know how to hunt at a free market.
I know.
Lazy.
Nintendo is taking advantage of lazy people.
Every industry out there takes advantage of people being lazy.
Infomercials exist.
They create problems for people that people didn't have before so that they can sell them a product for a problem they didn't have.
Thank you for reminding me because I actually have a problem with my cat not being able to get high enough on our windows so I had to go buy a sunny seat for it.
Your cat can live.
It's a cat.
She needs to be higher up on the window.
Shermie sits on the damn floor.
Cats desire height.
When she wants sunlight, she goes and sits in front of the door.
I think some of the greatest company ideas out there are formed on how can I allow people to be more lazy like let me give you an example there's companies out there that will do takeout for any type of food and they just charge like a surcharge we have something called takeout taxi yeah any restaurant in the world and get you takeout food now here's the thing not everybody who uses that is lazy because certainly you have homebound people sick people people who don't have driver's license people who are studying for their finals yeah exactly
But I'll betcha that's 10% of who's using it.
Oh yeah.
No, I understand.
It's just, you know, I don't want to start ranting again.
Forget it.
No, please, rant.
We haven't had good rants in a long time on this show.
Why can't people just get off their asses and just put effort into shit, you know?
Because then I have to look away from my farm and my plants on my farmville will die.
I was just ranting, Rob.
Nothing is going to equal the experience of sitting down and playing the game on the Super Nintendo with the right controller.
It's just not going to be the same.
That's the whole reason why we didn't get the new Donkey Kong, Rob.
It's because you can't play it with a classic controller.
It's not Donkey Kong.
You have to do the little shaky thing.
They didn't want to put motion control in it.
Miyamoto made them.
That's retarded.
I want to sit down and play a game that doesn't have motion control.
And I want to wear my pajamas while I'm doing it so I can be lazy playing it the way it's meant to be played.
So I'll go to effort to be lazy.
You know what's a really interesting comment here from Xlink in our chat room?
Netflix is another company.
And he didn't really put context to that, so I'm assuming it means Netflix kind of made their money off lazy things.
But I don't know.
Like...
I can definitely see that end of it, but I don't know if I'd necessarily call it lazy as much as it is damn convenient.
Because what did we have to do before?
You had to get out, get in your car, go to the video store, and so forth.
It's more convenience, in my opinion.
It's also kind of the subscriber fee.
When Blockbuster had their stores, not until the end, after Netflix was out, did they have these monthly fees where you could rent all the movies you wanted.
That's why people like Netflix from what I understood.
They could send one movie away and there'd be another one waiting for them.
I can kind of take that going to Blockbuster out of my daily routine and watch more movies.
I don't know if I would call that lazy, though.
I mean, I guess it is in a way.
People are convenience-centric.
They're focused on convenience.
And
I kind of miss going to Blockbuster and looking at the movies and reading the backs of them and everything and going to rent my games and the special rental only versions of stuff.
Well, there's still like one Blockbuster in every town if you want to do that.
It's just farther away now.
and the fucking Redbox thing.
I hate the Redbox.
That's why my husband doesn't have a job as a freaking Redbox.
Hate it.
I'm not really a big fan of Redbox either.
Like, in my opinion, you should go out to a blockbuster if you're going to use something like Redbox.
It's not that different.
And this is what the other problem is, too, is that I think that there's a sort of forced isolation going on people, you know?
It used to be you had to get out and be in society and be a part of things, but now it's like, everyone's an individual and we have to cater to everybody and...
Political Correct, and blah, blah, blah.
And I think that it's a matter of you're removing the human element from the equation.
Ooh, good point from Frisbee in our chat room.
Netflix eliminated the late fees.
That's why it got so popular.
That's a very good point.
But do you see what I mean?
No, I do.
I do.
I have to make sure our chatters.
Every gamer has a voice.
I gotta get their voice.
For example, even with World of Warcraft, going back to that, you're...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
See, I like to do both, but sometimes it's not practical.
You know what I mean?
Like sometimes I'm playing these games with people that live halfway across the country, all the way across the country.
That's fine.
That's one thing.
But I'm saying how many people in the guild live in town or near town?
I mean, that's, you know, one point.
It used to be that we would, all of us would get together like twice a week and play DDR or go to the arcade and something.
And now it's just like, oh, I'll see you online.
What happened to hanging out?
What happened to good old fashioned hanging out?
I think that the other thing with all of this is just that it's removing the personal element from everything.
We are a convenience-driven society and we also don't like dealing with people because it's inconvenient.
Anyway, more ranting.
Yet, yet, there's a stigma in our society that we all need to be skinny and beautiful because only skinny is beautiful.
But the realistic end of it is that with how much we are lazy and convenience-driven, it ought to be that sitting at home all day getting really, really...
Remember when Big Betts were in?
You have that magnet.
I like big butts and I cannot lie.
You other brothers can't deny.
I thought you liked boobs.
Alright, let's move on.
Release dates.
Let's travel around the world and see what is conveniently coming out to a store near you.
PC, Playstation 3, Xbox 360 Ghost Trick Phantom Detective Nintendo DS Ace Attorney
DC Universe, they're going to have that available on PlayStation 3 and PC, both the regular and collector's editions of those Prinny 2, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude, on PSP What?
Say that again Prinny 2, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude
Prinnies are the little guys in the Disgaea, little penguin dudes, right?
Yes.
And this is about Operation Panties?
Yes, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.
Okay, like what the fuck happened to this series when I wasn't watching it?
So like now there's a game coming out where the little penguins are going on a panty raid.
Am I correct?
I'm not sure.
What is Operation Panties?
I have no idea.
Yeah.
Alright, keep going.
I need to do some research.
Kingdom Hearts Recoded.
That's coming out on Nintendo DS this week.
Spellforce 2, Faith and Destiny on PC.
Let's see...
And that's basically it.
Next week, lots of good stuff.
But that's for next week.
Or the week after next, I should say.
I want me some LittleBigPlanet 2.
There's no wiki entry on Prinny 2, Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.
I'm trying to find more information on this.
I'm doing Google.
Give me a minute.
Let's see.
Okay, there's something on the PlayStation blog.
Let's see what this is all about.
Printy 2 is a side-scrolling hack-and-slash action game and you can play as Printy.
Your mission this time is to find the precious panties of Demon Lord Etna.
Yes, you have to search for Etna's panties, or Etna swears that she will skin all printies and make them into panties.
Well, now that I think of that, pretty panties would be kind of cool, but not for the printies.
You must find her panties by following morning in the game so you don't have any time to dilly-dally.
Let's get to it, dude.
Words escape me, folks.
This is what gaming has become.
Look at your life.
Look at your choices.
What are you doing?
Insolacious Pop is chiming in there.
Etna, the demon girl, was in Disgaea.
Her panties are missing and you fight an action platformer to find them.
But with panties, like in Ghosts and Goblins.
Ghosts and Goblins and panties.
I just, I can't.
Although, you know what, this game probably deserves to sell more copies than a lot of the stuff out there.
I mean, hooray for them for giving gamers what they really want.
Panties.
Let's move on to Japan and talk about some of the crazy games coming out over there.
On the Xbox 360, Arcana Heart 3 is making its way out this week.
Arcana Heart, that's the all chick fighters, right?
Alright, number three is coming out.
Panties will fly!
Or at least they will in my brain.
James Bond Bloodstone comes out on 360 this week as well as Mass Effect 2, the Japanese edition.
Took them a little while to localize it for those guys.
Stoked, Big Air edition also on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
And a very limited edition Arcana Heart 3 arcade stick coming out as well.
Coming out on the PlayStation 3.
Arcana Heart 3 gets a version there as well, and a joystick.
And James Bond Bloodstone also coming out on the PlayStation 3 in Japan.
So the releases kind of mirror each other there.
Nothing on the Wii this week.
In fact, things are kind of quiet from Nintendo until we get to the last story in a couple weeks.
And then, of course, Nintendo's going to be all about the 3DS in Japan in just a little bit.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
This game is like that old game Go, but with one of the world's experts, who's this kind of cute chick in her cyber form helping you to play that old game.
Does she strip down naked if I do well?
It's not strip Go.
Get your mind out of the gutter.
Not interested.
Also, Black Robina comes out this week from one of my favorite named companies over there.
Broccoli.
Broccoli.
You know what else?
Broccoli did.
What else?
DigiCarrot.
Ah.
Well, they're doing Black Robina on the PSP this week.
That's it for Japanese releases.
Well, for Europe, there's a few.
We have Zite on Xbox 360 for the 12th.
On the 14th is DC Universe Online and Ghost Trick.
And also Kingdom Hearts Recoded.
And that's it.
Alright, we're almost to the classic game of the week, but first, a couple more stories for you guys.
And this next story, you're going to want to remember this when we get into Part B tonight.
Yes, THQ has partnered with Mattel and they're going to be doing some brand new licensed games based on their properties.
And of course, some of the deals that they have in place already, well, they've already got some stuff, I guess.
He-Man by the power of Greyskull.
So that's kind of cool.
And then they haven't really said what other rights they're also going to be working with.
I guess...
let's see here they said Barbie, Hot Wheels it's kind of odd because Barbie and Hot Wheels right now Activision kind of has the rights to those because they've been making games for them for a while now mainly the Barbie stuff off of the DVD movies if you believe it or not they keep releasing DVD movies for Barbie stuff Fisher Price, Rock'em Sock'em Robots Masters of the Universe and Polly Pocket um
and of course, you know, people are wondering also, they're gonna be maybe doing some tie-ins with the U-Draw game tablet, because they do have that by the way so I don't know, it's interesting I wonder if they're gonna be doing any off the new Masters of the Universe series is that even still around?
do they show it in reruns?
weren't they supposed to be opting a new movie or something for that?
Well, Dolph Lundgren needs more work.
I'm serious, man.
Isn't he like senile by now?
He's got to be getting pretty old.
He was in Expendables.
He's not that old.
Well, Expendables was different though.
It brought back everybody for that movie.
And they're all pretty old.
Alright.
One more story for you guys, then the classic game of the week.
And this has to do with some big announcements at Consumer Electronics Show this week, which usually isn't a gaming show per se, but a few things will always get slipped in there because of course gaming consoles are what's in your living room.
and one place that gaming consoles have really expanded beyond just the place you play video games is being an entertainment device letting you watch movies and Netflix on them and Microsoft talked a little bit about Netflix expansion coming this spring Netflix will get Kinect enabled so you'll be able to flail your arms to queue up episodes of Veronica Mars if that's how you choose to do it I bet this will be one of those things where you use it a couple times to impress your friends and then you're done with it
Thanks for watching!
Maybe next year's CES.
Who knows?
Also announced, though, is that Hulu will be coming to Xbox.
It's out on the PlayStation, but Hulu Plus will be coming to the Xbox 360 at the same time later this spring.
So there you go.
One other little tidbit that was dropped in the press conference.
Remember how Microsoft had a goal of selling 5 million Kinect units by Christmas?
Well, they came out at CES and said they sold 8 million units.
But some people have said, wait a minute, did you really sell 8 million units or did you push 8 million units out there to retailers?
Hmm.
Well, regardless of however the numbers are being skewed, it still is a fairly impressive amount.
I guarantee if they, I think those are sold numbers because they haven't been sitting on shelves.
Let me put it that way.
They're hard to find.
So, yeah, and who knew?
A lot of people thought that that was going to be a high number for them to break because that's way more than they sold 360s in the first year.
Of course, 360s were really hard to get at that time, so I don't know.
These are still hard to get.
Are they really?
I guess I'm spoiled.
It seems that way at least.
Probably not for retailers.
It's pretty easy to get for them.
Yeah.
I like how everybody in our chatroom at chat.orangenetradio.com is coming out with their own ideas for what Kinect should do on voice command.
Like DDR Dollar Bill says, Kinect, get me a beer.
Frisbee in our chatroom says, computer, end holodeck.
DDR Dollar Bill says, Kinect, ban this douchebag who called me a racial slur.
Someday, someday.
TigerClaw, Xbox, play Tron.
Tron.
Tron.
I said Tron, damn it.
Yeah, it would be like the voice recognition on the DS.
Blue.
Blue.
Brew.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
you should put down all those newfangled holiday toys and your 3DSs and play games the way we used to when we had to walk barefoot through the snow both ways 20 miles up the river and eat our grape nuts to play these games I'm still hungry Rob, all I've had is pizza
Alright, what is the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
Space Fury.
Specifically, Space Fury on the ColecoVision.
You have to play a little bit of, you have to play the opening taunt.
I love that music.
Okay.
So this is the screen where you select your difficulty.
DarkSakura.com
It was put out by Sega on June 17th, 1981.
It has a rotate left, rotate right, and thrust and fire.
So basically, it kind of plays like Asteroids, but as you go through the game, you actually can get a little armored unit that takes you into different levels of different things you can shoot.
Except that these little segments combine into a bigger segment, and then you have to blow up the smaller segments and stuff, but they can blow you up.
It looks like a little bit Time Pilot, which kind of was Asteroids-inspired, too.
It's kind of like between the two.
As far as the arcade, the arcade version was Vector.
So, of course, this one's not Vector.
But the arcade version, it was Vector on an XY monitor, and it ran on the Sega G80 arcade system.
It had some of the best lines in it, like, So, a creature for my amusement, prepare for battle!
And my favorite one is... And I keep in mind, my mother was great at this game.
She played a lot of freaking Space Fury.
But, like, when you win the game, basically the last thing that you get is, Our battle has concluded, warrior.
You were a stimulating opponent.
And the alien in this also appears in a video game called Zector.
Now, for the Clicovision version, of course, it's sprite-based.
It's, you know...
Really, really early video game system.
I don't know what else I can say about that.
But you use the little... Because it had the keypad controller, so you'd actually thrust and go with your little side shoulders and fire that the same way.
And move around.
It was actually kind of hard to control.
I was not good at this game, but like I said, a lot of this game happened in my house.
And you can get power-ups for shooting and get extra...
I love this game and I played it on the ColecoVision actually.
It was one of the games I really enjoyed playing.
I never had a ColecoVision growing up.
I've got two.
You want to borrow one?
I'm not growing up anymore.
Oh, come on, Rob.
We know you're still growing up.
I am.
This is when it talked to you.
The voice is so realistic.
Bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep
All right, your classic game of the week this week is Space Fury.
Good pick, even if it's not one I'm super familiar with.
It looked very interesting, so I will have to check it out this week.
I think I've already done GORF, haven't I?
I'm sure you have.
I'm sure you have.
All right, we're going to take a quick break, guys, but don't go anywhere.
We're going to be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio in Part B tonight.
We're going to do some quick, quick news, including some news on what's going on with APB, Bionic Commando Rearm 2 we got some news on,
We're going to get some other news stories tonight about the Mac App Store, of course, your Twitter topics, the mailbag, and because DarkSakura specifically asked for it before the show started tonight, we're going to do a list list tonight.
I hope you were paying attention in part A because it has to do with what our list list is about.
We'll tell you all about that when we come right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, not soon, but it will come out and that will be a must-have.
But Blu-rays that came out recently that I need to see.
I still have not seen this movie.
Can you believe it?
Inception?
I still haven't seen it and I need to.
You do need to see that.
That is pretty awesome.
I've heard nothing but great things about that movie.
And now that the Blu-ray is out, I'm going to need to see that.
It is absolutely something you should see.
That was something else I missed in D-Box.
That would have been a good movie in D-Box.
Oh, really?
Well, D-Box is kind of really, really new, isn't it?
It's really, really new, yeah.
The theater out here that has it is brand spanking new.
It's brand spanking new, and it's only in one theater, and it's only one row of seats.
There's two rows of seats in the theater I was in.
Oh, then maybe it is two rows.
I thought it was just one.
But yeah, it's only one theater that they have it in.
Very limited.
It's fun.
It's one of 30 theaters that has it.
And that's, of course, the seats that move, the little motion seats that, you know.
But it's fun.
It's completely unnecessary for a lot of movies.
Like, the only movie I've seen in D-Box was the Resident Evil movie.
And honestly, I'm not a fan of the Resident Evil series and stuff, but that movie is so far away from the Resident Evil game series.
It's more of, like, The Matrix now.
Right.
It was still pretty cool.
And I think with Tron, though, just even watching Tron the first time around, it's going to be awesome with the D-Box stuff.
I'm really looking forward to it.
Let us know when you're going.
I even think, though... Probably Wednesday during the day.
I'm glad I did the D-Box thing, but it was a little silly.
It was a little silly.
But it's cool to say you did it.
Which movie did you do it for?
Tron.
Oh, you did?
Yeah.
When's Hot Christmas Eve?
Oh, did you like it?
It was...
Because I really like Tron, yes, but it was a little unnecessary and it was kind of expensive.
Don't expect to get just thrown around in the seats because that ain't happening.
I mean, you can adjust the intensity of it, but I would compare it a little more to Captain EO where the movements in the seat are very subtle.
There's a lot of the flying stuff in there.
I thought that would be pretty cool.
Some of it's kind of neat.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think yeah or that they have to make it like pitch pitch black in there which they can't you know that's what they do on things like star tours and stuff to kind of take you out of that but uh yeah you know they can't do that for emergency reasons and for people want to leave to go to the bathroom so uh yeah I think D-Box still has some tweaking that they need to do but it was you know what it was fun save up save up like the eight grand or whatever get a home unit
Defective Candy in our chatroom says So a D-Box is like Honey I Shrunk the Audience at Disney
No, because those chairs don't move.
The movie's a lot better, too.
Because Honey, I Shrunk the Audience was terrible.
Well, those seats don't move, though, in Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.
A little bit.
They do a little bit.
And I liked that because Eric Idle was in it.
There's a part when the baby picks up the audience and does this thing.
You gotta admit, that part was pretty cool.
Yeah, but the movie itself was dopey.
Yeah, it was.
It really outstayed its welcome.
I mean, when was the last time they made a honey-eye blank the kids?
Well, you know, I had to say because Eric Idle was in it.
I am really sad that Rick Moranis is not getting more work.
I mean, seriously.
That was by his choice, I believe.
I believe he retired to raise his children.
Okay, well, then props to him.
Once you make Strange Brew, you can retire.
That's what it is, I guess.
All right.
I still think his best movie was My Blue Heaven.
DarkSakura does a side podcast with her friends Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.
Comic Insanity
Awesome.
And you have to listen to it.
If you're a loyal OLR listener, you have to listen to that too.
And you should also listen to Horde House.
Even if you don't play WoW, you can hear Extover make dick and fart jokes.
Horde House, the best little Horde House in Azeroth, tapes on Thursdays typically.
We don't want to be held to that, but usually if we don't do Thursday, we'll do Friday.
So later in the week is when we do our show and we put it right up on iTunes so you folks can grab that.
And yeah, it's a fun show.
We always have a third random guest and DarkSakura has made it known she wants to come on and be that guest.
So we're going to work her into a future episode.
Sadly, won't happen this week.
We're having our gala 10th episode special this week.
A look back.
10th anniversary?
Yes, a look back at 10 hilarious episodes of The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.
It'll be a good time.
And very self-serving because that's what anniversary podcasts should be.
Because we're making a big, big deal for our team.
Like, I'm telling you, the 10th episode of Horde House is a much bigger deal than 400 episodes of OLR.
I mean, I'm sorry, but that's just... It's a joke, DarkSakura.
Get it?
I'm eating Alright, let's get to some rapid fire news I can't make weird faces at you when I'm doing chipmunk cheeks We don't have a website by the way We're not on Infamous.net and we're not even on OrangeLaunchRadio.com We have a blog spot and really that's just the shell for the podcast feed Also We don't have a website right now Before we forget, Geek Life Go to geek-life.com, we're having a comic book giveaway So go in there and read about it
And by the way, speaking of Geek Life, Maren Marvel, who runs that and who has filled in for me on this very program, she was on episode 8 of Horde House, not this week's, but last week's episode.
She did a phenomenal job.
So if you haven't heard that episode of Horde House, you should go listen to it.
She did a very good job.
All right, let's go to some rapid-fire news, some of the news stories that we just didn't find the long amounts of time to talk about in other parts of the show, but we wanted to talk about them anyway.
APB reloaded.
They're doing a beta for it.
How ironic, because I actually participated in the original APB beta.
If you're interested in that, they're going to be starting the closed beta in February.
The official Twitter account, APB Reloaded, has more information on that.
Apparently, you can sign up on the official website.
It is, of course, going to be free to play when it finally launches, unlike the original APB.
I didn't think APB was that bad of a game.
I thought it was actually pretty cool, but unfortunately it didn't last too long.
Definitely worth checking out, especially since it's going to be free to play.
The PSP Go has been hacked, not surprisingly.
The brand new, I guess, firmware 6.31 and 6.35 have a new homebrew enabler for them.
And using this homebrew enabler, you're actually able to load the Prometheus ISO loader, which for those who don't know, it loads dumps of different PSP games.
and, of course, the PSP game to show off your hack would be Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, the PSP game that does not have a digital version of it on the PlayStation Network store, pissing off people that own a PSP Go.
And, of course, this homebrew enabler doesn't really require any sort of tricks to get it to work, so that's...
Not good news for Sony, but I'm sure they'll try to find a way to patch that out.
And then finally, there's a couple games in this series that have been available on the iOS store.
Of course, the Japanese App Store, or if you have a jailbroken iPhone or iPod, you can also find these available as well.
Um, it's a game dev story, and of course there's game dev story 2.
Well now there's a brand new game that they have coming out called, uh, Why Why the Game Dealer.
And it's basically, um...
a game retail store sim and the game dealer you assume the role of a game store boss who must manage employees and please customers all while balancing the stock portfolio of game development studios and apparently also be able to offer customers food and shoo away mall rats from the free food mini games that's funny um
The Game Dealer is available on the Japanese App Store right now.
That sounds like fun.
That's real life for a lot of people that listen to this show, I'm sure.
Yeah.
Awesome.
All right, let's go to Rock Band and what is coming out this week in Rock Band.
They're still kicking along with new releases.
Although this is a new release, I'm going to take a big fat pass on, but maybe some of you out there are into this.
Linkin Park Pack comes out this week, January 11th.
Crawling, In the End, Numb...
Somewhere I Belong, Waiting for the End, and What I've Done.
All those songs are coming out for either 160 Microsoft points, 200 Wii points, or $1.99 on the PlayStation Store.
You can also get some pro guitar or bass expansions for the song In the End and What I've Done.
Again, if you like Linkin Park, that is.
If you are a fan of Elder Scrolls and you're just sitting there tapping your fingers waiting for Skyrim to come out, well, maybe now is a good time to go back and visit Morrowind.
There's a brand new mod that just came out called Morrowind 2011.
Morrowind 2011 was a mod that was released last week, and it basically makes Morrowind just even more gorgeous than it was originally.
Because remember Morrowind, I mean, for the time it was awesome graphics, but
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The author who originally made this whole expansion, he talked about it on his blog, which is at morowind2011.wordpress.com.
He said, quote, In the end, I'm just very disappointed that I wasn't given a chance to correct the issues with the package, as I knew there were issues that were in the process of being fixed or updated.
But the file is out on the internet, and it will be very hard for anyone to remove it from all the sites.
Anyhow, one other thing, and I'm very excited about this, the Facebook Civilization game.
That's right, I'm getting excited about a Facebook game.
What are you going to do about it?
Civilization World starts its alpha testing phase on January 12th.
You can go sign up for it now, but it was a little weird because I guess you need to have a team name and all this other stuff.
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
More stuff, and some weird stuff among it, but including this weird-ass mustache.
And I'll get into that.
Basically, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 is coming out, along with an extra mustache on the dude, and jumping!
It will be on PlayStation Network on Tuesday, February 1st.
It'll be $15.
And then the next day it will be on Xbox Live Arcade for 1,200 Microsoft points.
Challenge Rooms, and Mustache Sailor Moon
Well, Sailor Moon is having a new DS game come out in Italy.
Namco Bandai Europe is bringing the first Sailor Moon DS game.
And it's the second Sailor Moon game that's being released outside of Japan.
And it's called La Luna Splenda, which, yeah, very Sailor Mooney.
and they're saying it's adventure, fantasy, fun, action these are the watchwords for next spring yeah the last Sailor Moon game that I had was on the Super Nintendo
and trailers for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 reveal two more characters.
And one of them, I saw coming.
The other one, I'm like, why?
Even though it is cool.
Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely cool.
The first one we get is Hagar from Final Fight and Saturday Night Slam Masters.
That game was so awesome.
I wish we could get that on the Xbox Live Arcade.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
This game is out, what, next month, is it?
I can't remember.
I get my release dates all mixed up.
That's going to be exciting.
It's pretty cool.
All right.
Well, is that it for the Rapid Fire News?
Yarp.
Then we will get into the Twitter topics for tonight.
I'm going to go to the tweeters, twitter.com slash OLR, where you show us your tweets every Sunday night here on this program.
www.streetfighter.com
I guess they have actually kind of used the editor mode to make like Ken and Vega and Blanca, Dhalsim.
Somebody having fun with the editor mode there.
That's kind of cute.
I like how you can get the interview with M. Bison and everything.
Kind of funny.
Yeah, we were talking about that on the show earlier.
Oh, were you?
Yeah.
Oh, awesome.
Yeah, that's very well done.
And the moves are pretty much what you'd expect out of them.
You know, I don't really play a lot of these wrestling games, but that's pretty cool.
Dude, Dudley.
Yeah.
I like this, too.
In the side, like, what's recommended.
It looks like there's a Felicia in one of these.
Like, somebody did that.
Wow.
Big boobies on Felicia.
All right, anyway.
Moving on.
Going to SSJ100Matt on Twitter.
DarkTetsuya
to Milpitas.
Bye!
DarkSakura.com
TigerClaw says Ion and Atari is teaming up for the iCade, a classic arcade machine set up for your iPad.
Oh, that's adorable.
It's this cute little machine with tangible joystick and buttons that you can put your iPad in and, like, play old games with.
That's cool.
I like that.
Except the fact that you can buy a...
you know I know it's a really expensive way of playing something that you can get a million other ways but it's still cute I say it was cute and one more tweet for us from Tiger Claw Microsoft confirms that Kinect PC support is coming
Well, good.
As it should be, because if the modding community is so far ahead of them, it's almost a little bit embarrassing.
It is coming.
It already is here, basically.
Well, my official Kinect PC support is coming.
Steve Ballmer hinted at this support in his keynote speech there.
It is part of the company's larger plan.
Quote,
Well, we certainly started out on Xbox and we're very focused in on gaming.
We're the number one game console in a lot of countries and we're very happy about that.
We're trying to do two major things, though.
We're trying to move beyond gaming to include the world of socialization, movies, TV, and music.
And we're trying to make the whole experience accessible to everybody in the family, not just the traditional gamer.
So just expect this whole Kinect craze to grow, at least if Microsoft's keynote is to be taken at face value.
All right.
So this is kind of interesting and not too different than what they were doing.
I guess it's an improvement maybe.
But THQ for Homefronts, they're doing the online pass thing again.
But this time instead of just saying, hey, you know what, you better buy the game new or pay the $10 and have no online play.
They're saying, hey, you know what, you better buy the game new or pay $10 or have,
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
I don't know.
It's still kind of a crappy way of doing things, but it's slightly better than not offering any online component at all.
So now you get a demo of the online component.
That's basically what this boils down to.
That's kind of weird.
That's them combating the use sales.
But of course, I don't know if this is a game I'm particularly interested in, so we'll see.
Who knows?
It looked cool.
But some of the early leaders were Flight Control HD and Chopper 2 That's right, some of the same crap that you see on the iPhone and iPad Is also dominating the Mac App Store Now if you don't know what the Mac App Store is It's basically Imagine Steam and Apple kind of combined It's selling, I don't want to say PC games But Mac games, like for your actual Mac In the same vein that you buy iPad and iPod stuff right now I think it's a great idea
Well, it's a very logical and idea that makes sense.
And especially because, you know, a lot of these games are kind of cheaper this way.
Like games like Chopper 2, 99 cents.
Angry Birds, five bucks.
So, I mean, that's much cheaper than going into an actual store and paying 20 or even 40 bucks for one of these.
Of course, not everything is so cheap.
I mean, some programs like iMovie is 15 bucks.
Aperture, 80 bucks.
You know, but it's a way for them to sell, you know.
so uh interesting uh but what also is notable about this hackers you know the old saying hackers gonna hack so actually i just made up that saying so now we have haters gonna hate and hackers gonna hack well hackers gonna hack and they uh found the loophole in the mac app store they pirated angry birds already it took less than just a couple of days uh yep that's it
All you have to do is copy and paste this in-store purchase code and you can get the games for free.
By the way, I love this.
The name of the group that hacked the games, Hackulous.
Get it?
Like, tapulous?
Well, Hackulous, actually, they're responsible for the program Instalus, which is what people use to download pirated games on the iPod.
and iPad.
I keep thinking of Tapulous who makes Tap Tap Revenge.
That would be fun.
Alright, let's move on with some more stories.
DarkSakura.
Monster Hunter 3 event go on because the town itself was similar to the one used in the game.
and they had a lot of people go up including people who said that they probably would have never gone had you know they're not been the Monster Hunter event and I've got a couple of friends that live overseas who were totally in the Monster Hunter and like will go to the special Capcom events and camp out outside their offices and stuff so pretty crazy stuff
Konami did something similar for Love Plus at the Atami Onsen.
So they did the same thing.
And one was done at... Let me see if I can pronounce this right.
Shakunage no Mori Botanical Park in Mimata.
So they did something too.
That was for Colony Nasekatsu Plus.
Thanks for watching!
Can we get like Angry Birds the ride?
Can you imagine if you could go on like a Mario Brothers roller coaster where like as you're going up, like imagine, can you know that part of California Screamin' where it goes up, down, up, down, up, down?
That my favorite part?
Yeah, a bunch of hills really fast.
What should happen is at the top of every hill on the Mario coaster, ba-ding, ba-ding, ba-ding.
That would be great.
Tell me they could not make an awesome theme park out of a video game.
They could do it.
I mean, I guess it would be all the licensing and so forth.
It would be a pain in the ass.
But still, make it happen.
They made a game in a theme park.
The Toy Story game.
Oh, that's true.
That was fun.
That Toy Story game is awesome.
And they are actually able to update it like an iPhone game or something with new levels and things like that.
I haven't ridden it since Toy Story 3 came out, but I heard there's some newer stuff in there.
Yeah, that was really fun.
Keep surprises going.
And then the game came out.
But yeah, we could totally have a mall taken over by zombies.
Like a Dead Rising ride?
Maybe.
Perhaps.
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
Loki, what would you want to see at a video game theme park?
Um...
I don't know.
I mean, I don't think it's really a good idea, actually.
You don't think it's a good idea?
Why not, hater?
I guess it'd be fun to see, like, giant rabbit, you know, people dressed up as the giant rabbits or whatever.
That'd be kind of funny.
Or just imagine booth babes everywhere.
So you're suggesting a Hooters theme park.
They have a Hooters hotel, why not?
They do.
It's the ugliest looking hotel I've ever seen.
Can you imagine one of those station wagons with the wood grain paneling on the outside turned into a hotel?
That would be the Hooters hotel.
They have wood grain paneling on the outside of the hotel.
Why?
I don't know, why?
Because they're tacky.
Alright, let's move on to another story.
Loki, what do you have for us?
I'm not getting a reply I'm not getting a reply
The Elder Scrolls Game
One is going to be the way that the game actually levels.
The player's levels are now going to be more balanced because I guess actually in the game, much like Fallout 3 and that kind of stuff, as you level up, the enemies level up as well.
Well, in Oblivion, it got to the point where it was...
Pretty damn impossible to be able to go up against some of the enemies because they would just be leveling up with you.
I don't like roleplaying games where they level completely up with you.
I think at some point you have to be able to overpower them a little bit.
A little bit.
I do agree that it should be a difficulty setting if something like that.
Anyways, it's going to scale to the player's level, but it's going to be more balanced, they're saying.
It says foes will likely be easily bested by using some of the new features in the game, like dual wielding, I guess is going to be a new feature that they're going to have.
You can equip any item or spell to either hand using both simultaneously in combat.
So that's pretty cool.
And then, of course,
They were saying that, I guess, also the leveling system, they're saying no longer binds players to class defined by a set of skills.
It says players can pick and choose from the game's 18 abilities, which level up while using them simultaneously, unlocking perks with each new level.
So it basically sounds like it's going to be Fallout.
And then they're also going to include new weapon crafting systems, improved character creation tools, etc.
And that's pretty cool, character creation-wise, because I believe their tools are pretty impressive in Oblivion.
The only problem I found with Oblivion, though, is I can create any character I want as long as they were butt-fucking-ugly, because that's all that that tool would create is really ugly-looking people.
You know, the Fallout one isn't much better, to be honest.
I don't know how much you've played around in Fallout 3, but a lot of the characters are fugs there, too.
So, sorry to say.
By the way, SolarFlare reminds me in the chatroom, like FF8, Rob?
Yes, exactly like that.
All right.
One more story for you guys, then we're going to get to Listless tonight.
I'm so excited.
I haven't even told you guys the topic.
I think it's a fun topic tonight.
But if you were paying attention earlier in the show, we dropped a hint.
Yep.
So maybe you figured it out.
And I finally got a guest for us, and it's an exciting guest that we haven't had on the show in a while.
Yep.
So we'll get to that in a minute.
I want to go to this story about EA.
Pulling the plug on some old games.
That's right, the servers are getting shut down for some old games because that fee you pay to use Xbox Live, well, it doesn't pay to keep old shit running.
Now, the good news is most of this stuff is old sports games, you know, games that have been replaced with newer versions.
For example, NCAA Basketball 08 and 09, gone.
NCAA Football 07, 08, 09 in 2010, gone.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura.com
Also closing on January 17th, the Sims Carnival.
So if you were a Sims Carnival fan, but there must not have been that many of you because EA's shutting the server down, you will not be able to play anymore after January 17th.
And there's this contingent out there going, there was a Sims Carnival?
Exactly.
Now, February 8th is when most of the sports games are scheduled to close.
To be honest, this is nothing new.
It's always a bummer when it's games that aren't really sports games that upgrade every year, but it's kind of inevitable.
And again, they feel like they can pull the plug because you're not playing them.
Party Party
It's time for Listless tonight, boys and girls.
I'm so excited.
We haven't done one of these in a while.
The way Listless works, we are going to be forming the definitive list.
And there is no arguing once this list is complete.
This is a very scientific method.
And it involves you guys in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com We're going to bring in a fourth person to play along with us tonight.
Let's get him on the line.
I'll dumb down the music here while we give our friend a call.
Hello!
Hi!
Hi!
Is this Breslow? !
It usually is.
Oh, Lord, hang up, Rob.
Long time no talk, my friend.
How are you?
I'm kidding.
Happy New Year, DarkSakura.
Geez.
I'm kidding.
Hard, hard, hard, hard.
What are your New Year's resolutions, Breslau?
It doesn't matter.
I've broken them all already.
I did my first episode of USL, so those are all out the window.
Congratulations.
If you don't know Bress Lowell, not only has he guested on this show a little bit in the past, not so much lately though, sadly, but that's because he's too busy doing another show.
He's big time now, a host on Under Sedation Live, which is Saturday nights on the All Games Network.
And with Iguana Girl, who's been on this show as well, Jessica Harper, Travis Donovan, who I'm afraid to have on this show.
But Rob's never been on Under Sedation Live, has he?
That's where I grew up.
That was my old stomping grounds.
Apparently, this is our 10th year doing it, and we didn't even realize it.
Wow.
And here I was talking about OLR celebrating the 400th episode.
But, you know, USL's taking a lot of breaks.
I don't even know if they've gotten up to 400.
I hate to say it, DMN.
I don't know.
Whoa, hey.
Blast from the past there.
Oh, sorry, Breslow.
Because I'm looking at... Never mind, I don't want to say it.
But I'm looking at something, and it still says the old name.
I wanted to have you on specifically to talk about USL madness
Yes, we extended the deadline because not a lot of people submitted.
Basically what you do is you get a list of your 25 most favorite video games of all time.
They can be as far back as Atari 2600 and television, and they can be as modern as Xbox 360, PS3, PC.
They can even be your favorite arcade games.
We actually have had one nomination for Skee-Ball, believe it or not.
Okay, good choice actually.
Skee-Ball is pretty awesome.
but basically what you do is you get that list together order it from 1 to 25 1 being Super Metroid, 25 being Minecraft or something I like how you told everybody what to make their number ones your number one you're just going to put Super Metroid next to it because otherwise you're crazy
and then you submit those to uslmadness at gmail.com voting actually we extended it a week it closes tonight at midnight pacific which is if you're listening live less than 4 hours from now alright procrastinators I expect the live listeners to get cracking do you accept like partial lists what if somebody's like I can't get to 25 but I've got 10 would you take that?
LB to Action!
What's that?
Wow!
Yeah, Minecraft's in the top 30, Pac-Man's in the top 30, Fallout might get a one seed this year.
Like, that's how nuts it is.
Nice.
Now, DDRDollarBill's in the chatroom saying, fuck Minecraft.
So, DDRDollarBill, that means you better get your list in so you can bump Minecraft down a little bit.
And then we will announce the bracket sometime this coming week.
Alright, uslmadness at gmail.com.
Super Metroid's a one seed, right?
No.
What?!
What? !
Yeah, I know.
This whole contest is a sham.
Your listeners are insane.
I'm not sure which.
Are you ready to play listless with us tonight?
I am.
I actually have a list ready of something that I don't know anything about.
Here we go.
Because I don't tell you the topics in advance.
That would never happen in the magic of radio.
Let's tell the listeners already what the topic is.
Alright, if you were listening in Part A, I said pay attention when Loki did the story about THQ and Mattel are entering a game deal, which means we might get a Masters of the Universe video game.
So we thought, you know what we should do?
Let's talk about toys that we think ought to be video games.
Because, you know, if we limited it to just Mattel, I don't know what's Mattel and what's not.
Like, Barbie's Mattel, right?
I don't know.
So we're going to just say toys in general.
board games, whatever anything you can find in the toy aisle at Target or Walmart or Toys R Us I should say is fair game.
Except for like diapers.
Like I don't think they should make a video game out of diapers.
So if you guys have diapers on your list, please remove it.
It has to be an actual marketed toy item.
Yes, it needs to be a toy.
So babies R Us items don't count.
Alright everybody?
Now chat room here's what you guys need to do.
You need to start suggesting things in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com because if one of the hosts
Ends up duplicating something we usually turn to chat to figure out how to fill in the gaps there.
Also, the chat plays a very important part in this, because what's going to happen, we're going to go around and everybody's going to name their top three.
Myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and Breslow will each name their top three.
Then each of us will go around and take one item off of the list.
Something will not be worthy of the list.
That will leave us with a list of eight, and you guys in our chatroom vote to come up with a definitive list of three.
I know this sounds really complicated, you guys, but that's why it's a scientific process.
Science is hard, y'all.
Be careful, guys.
We're about to try science.
She blinded me with science.
All right.
Let's get into the list.
Why don't we start tonight?
How about Loki?
I don't know how often you start in list list, but tonight you're starting this list list.
What toy ought to be a video game?
This is a terrible, terrible answer, but I'm going to do it anyways because it's simple.
It's simple.
Ball.
Ball.
Ball.
Ball!
Okay, tell us how the game Ball works.
Really can be anything.
You see, balls are very versatile toys.
You can play whatever games you want with them.
Ball.
Press A to bounce.
It'd be like one of those reverse sandbox games or something.
It's Minecraft, but with balls.
I can see the commercial now.
Come, play with our balls.
Alright, I'll go next.
My number three choice.
My number three choice for toy they should make into a game.
Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven.
That was on my list and I removed it, Rob.
All right, so, Cookie Mama... Wouldn't that be in the reverse, though?
What do you mean?
They're, like, kind of making a video game into a toy.
The toy's already existed ever since I was a little girl.
No, it's video games based on a toy.
Easy Bake Ovens have been around forever, and now Cookie Mama's gonna take that old toy... I understand.
...and she's gonna make fine cuisine with nothing but a light bulb.
You press the eject button and food comes out.
DarkSakura, what is your number three answer?
Toy that ought to be a game.
The erector set level building game.
We have to build the whole thing out of erector sets and then you run your little guy through the erector set.
Okay.
It's kind of like a Lego game but not because it's an erector set.
Kind of a little big planet.
Only you build the whole thing out of erectors.
Wow.
Erector sets.
Well, screw chat.
They're not giving the answers that come on the show.
You are, Bressel.
It doesn't matter if chat took them.
Here's my throwaway choice then.
Alright, fine.
Homies.
Homies.
Oh, God.
Little Homies.
Those little toys, the Homies.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
I haven't seen those in forever.
Hey, you want to hear something ironic?
Huh?
There was a Little Homies game.
Was there?
Yes, there was.
Wow.
Well, they need to do a better one.
What would the Homies game be?
Brestle.
I don't know, Saints Row 3?
It was a kart racing game, is what it was.
Oh, God.
Screw that.
They need to do it again.
Alright.
I love some of the choices that are coming out in chat, by the way.
Alright, number two pick, Loki, who brought us Ball.
What is your number two pick for a toy they ought to make into a video game?
If you say Top, I'm coming down to Sacramento and punching you.
Saying what?
Top.
Top.
Thanks for watching!
fuck yes I heard Domino Rally Domino Rally was awesome now granted I know that they have a game called Domino Rally that's you know Mr. Domino but that's a different thing no fuck Mr. Domino I know what you're talking about you're talking about dominoes that do loop-de-loops and all the crazy stunts right yes all right yeah I'm I support you there you can build levels out of dominoes it'd be awesome awesome I like that pick Domino Rally is Loki's number two pick my number two my number two pick tonight uh light bright dance dance revolution
Because I can think of no better way to rave than with Light Bright.
Use your Light Bright to throw a sweet rave party.
Exactly.
Sandstorm is already a confirmed song in Light Bright DDR.
Just so y'all know.
It'd be awesome and you know it.
It'd be rave and the kids would be getting high and playing their light bright DDR.
Alright.
DarkSakura, what is your number two choice for toy they ought to make a video game?
Bratz Doom.
As in they're all the monsters and you have to go around shooting them with the BFG.
Bratz in Doom.
Bratz Doom.
Bratz Doom.
Shoot the Bratz, alright?
I like that.
Would the final level have Paula Abdul?
Because she was involved with the movie.
Or no wait, she got fired from the movie, I think.
Dude, you have to be a special kind of stupid to get fired from the Bratz movie.
Or a special kind of high.
Wall drugs.
All right.
Loki, what is... I'm sorry, not Loki.
Breslul.
You guys are so the same.
It's hard to tell you guys apart.
One of you is sitting right here.
All right.
Breslul, what is your number two choice for a toy they need to make into a video game?
I really hope one of you three have heard of this board game, but I'm gonna say Dominion.
We'll see you next time.
Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set, Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, and Dominion.
Loki, what is your number one pick?
I'll take your Bratz Doom and I'll raise you Dead Rising Mole Madness.
That's great.
That's great.
Not only do you have to fight off zombies, but you also have to find good deals on clothing and other couture.
I really should have put that.
What's that dating game called?
I really should have put that on my list and I didn't.
Girl Talk?
Girl Talk!
Actually, they have this really shitty looking game that I've seen at Target.
It's something about, like, it's called, like, Oops, That's the Truth.
What the hell is this game called?
It's some type of, like, weird party game that they're selling as an Xbox 360 game.
Oh, um... Somebody's had to have heard of this.
No, I know what you're talking about.
It's the Truth or Lies?
Yes, that game.
No, it's called Truth or Bargain Bin, actually.
Exactly, very soon.
Alright, my number one pick.
I picked a serious one, just like Bressol did for his last one.
My serious number one answer, Millborn on Xbox Live Arcade.
That would be pretty badass, too.
Millborn is like the best French card game ever made.
It might be the only French card game ever made, but damn it, it's awesome.
The whole point of that game is to fuck your buddy.
That's the whole point of the game.
DarkSakura, what's your number one answer?
My Little Pony Deathmatch
I think it should be... They bite and get rabies and stuff.
I think it should be like Derby Owners Club, but with My Little Pony where you can whip the horses when they're bad.
And whichever one is last gets shot.
Michael Vick presents My Little Pony Deathmatch.
Okay, how about we call it... Here's the name.
Death Race My Little Pony.
And if you pre-order now, we'll give you a year's supply of Elmer's glue.
I was thinking that.
Death Race, My Little Pony is DarkSakura's number one answer.
DarkSakura, I'm noticing a trend here.
I think you have some anger issues.
Somebody's homicidal tonight.
Breslow, what is your number one answer?
This was mentioned in the chat, and this is basically Pong on crack in board game form, Crossfire.
Oh shit, I remember the commercials for those.
That's the one where you have all those steel balls, right?
Yeah.
My mother would never buy me that when I was growing up.
My mom wouldn't buy me that either.
I love my mom.
There was a pinball table that used that same thing called Hyperball.
Really?
Crossfire was awesome.
All the little boys wanted one.
Probably some of the girls, too.
I bet DarkSakura wanted Crossfire, too.
Yeah, my mom wouldn't get it for me.
But she got it for my brothers, go figure!
Our parents were all mean.
Loki, did your parents buy you Crossfire?
I didn't want it, but I got to play it and it was fun.
One moment.
Shoot a bunch of balls at this other thing with ball in the middle.
You alright, Bressel?
Bressel needed to put the show on hold for a minute so he could tend to some business.
BRB, poopin'!
All right.
Well, here's the list as it stands right now.
Ball, Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dominion, Dead Rising Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade, Death Race My Little Pony, and Crossfire.
This is hard.
We have to eliminate some of these from the list.
I don't know if I can.
All right, but we got... That's how it works.
So, Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
Homies.
It's already got a game in.
It's crap.
Sorry.
Homies is gone.
Brussels, back from his poop.
Welcome back.
All right.
Let's see.
My turn.
Oh, this is hard.
I don't want to eliminate any of these.
I...
I'm sorry, I hate to do this because I know the chatters probably love this one.
I've got to eliminate Ball because I just don't get it.
What is the game?
That sounds like a tech demo to me, so I'm sorry.
Ball has been stricken from the list.
DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
Only for lack of familiarity, Dominion.
Oh, poor Breslul got two of them yanked from the list.
But that's okay, Breslul, because you're obviously not going to eliminate your own, so you get at least one on there.
Breslul, which of these is not worthy of the list?
I'm going to eliminate Crossfire.
I mean, Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven.
Oh, why are you eliminating Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven?
because if only on the guarantee that it'll like my Xbox will spit out delicious treats which I don't think that technology is quite there yet so not yet not until we get the holodeck and how it makes food and everything all right so here's the list that our chatters are going to vote on you're going to vote for your number one and number two pick and you're going to send them over private message to sky in the chat room please label your number one and your number two choices or I'm going to assume what you list first is number one and what you list second is number two so here is the
You alright, Breslow?
You need a minute?
Alright, so here's the list as it stands right now.
Erector Set Level Building Game, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dead Rising Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade, Death Race, My Little Pony, and Crossfire.
Chatters, it's now in your hands to come up with a definitive list of the top three toys that need to be video games.
And while you're at it, Breslau, repeat the March Madness, the USL Madness email.
I will do that.
It is uslmadness at gmail.com.
You have about three and a half hours to get those submissions in.
If you're listening on the podcast, I'm sorry.
The expiration has gone past, but we will have voting up probably by the time you're listening to this.
And I noticed that somebody in studio just sent you an email.
I think I already did one before, but I did it again just to be safe.
I don't think I got one from you, but I'm assuming that it now rhymes with Waklakura.
Yeah.
You might be right, actually.
All right.
Yeah.
So there you go.
Thank you so much for playing our dumb little game tonight, Brestle.
We really appreciate it.
Best of luck with USL Madness and everything that goes on at Understation Live.
Tell the others we said hi.
Tell Iguana Girl I'd like to go see another D-Box movie with her at some point and have Pinkberry.
Okay.
All right.
Hey, guys, one more thing.
Yes.
Yeah, he hung up.
Ask.
You ask.
They have Ninja Legos now.
Place your vote, by the way, right now.
Send your number one and your number two choices.
You have until the end of the mailbag segment to get those votes in.
And I'll tell you a spoiler.
There's not a lot of emails tonight.
So hurry, hurry, hurry.
But let's see what is in the email bag.
We're going to open it up right now, folks.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us your emails every week.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura is going to jump in the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite emails for you all.
How about the one email we got?
One email?
Holy shit.
It's a big one though.
You better get those votes in now.
Well, it actually is from Rababa.
Picking apart an Ars Technica story about Nintendo warning about the 3D for young gamers.
So I'm going to read the email as is.
First, they claim that eye growth as literally translated may be harmed according to a warning statement for the 3DS.
They state that it isn't about actual growth, but rather perception.
The concern is that the portions of our visual system that reside in the brain are adaptive.
They adjust to information we receive and can remap connections in order to operate more efficiently on a typical input.
This is especially true in infants as the visual system is still developing at the earliest stages of life.
which is true, babies can't see much of anything for the first few weeks except blurs this ability to rewire our visual system on the fly is behind the 3D health concerns I actually don't know if what they state is true but it does seem made up to me I wish it said according to this article in the Lancet or the like
I find it odd that they forget about the common eye disorder lazy eye where muscles in one eye don't grow causing a seemingly cross eye.
This treatment is remarkably simple wearing an eye patch to exercise the weaker eye.
I always assumed the warning was for conditions like lazy eye.
What do you think?
Also, isn't the warning more about what we don't know about simulated 3D effects?
I'm sure that there will also be warnings to stop using 3D if you develop nausea or headache.
Either way, it must be better than the red-blue 3D.
Later, rababa.
Cyan magenta.
I think we got into this a little bit last week on the show with the disclaimer, but I think it's just Nintendo kind of overcompensating a little bit where it's just that we live in a too happy society.
They're covering their ass.
Yeah, and I think a kid would have to play these games for a very long time.
But I'll admit, when I was playing the 3DS, I did feel that little pull on my eyes.
But, you know, when it got to me, I just would turn the slider off.
So it's really about just kind of knowing your limits, I suppose, and knowing when to turn that off.
Now, I guess a child wouldn't really know their limits, but that's why parents have to supervise, you guys.
So, I don't know.
I don't know what else to say on that.
Anything else for that email, DarkSakura?
Nope.
Death Race, Not Dead Rising
Dead.
This is the very, very last call.
If you don't get those votes in now, they may not count because we have to move into the FUs of the week.
It's the part of the show where we get angsty.
F you to my hip for hurting like a motherfucker all week and keeping me from doing fun things.
However, I have leveled quite a bit in World of Warcraft and F you to that too.
Loki?
F you to my shoulder.
I must have slept on it weird or something last night because it's been hurting the hell out of me today, so that really sucks.
Are you sure that your child hasn't learned how to climb out of the crib and come chew on your shoulder?
No, he tried to eat my nose last night though, so it's possible.
Well, babies are always sticking things in their mouths.
I don't know if you saw the picture on Facebook Nellie posted.
That picture was great.
It was like some, he just like all of a sudden started attacking my nose.
It was funny.
It's something!
Bite!
Babies are cute.
Until they get three and decide to jump on you and break your back.
And then they're still cute.
Yeah, the way that I hurt my hip is catching Becky's son Julian.
Because now he's falling with style on top of people.
Like in Toy Story.
Alright, my FU of the week goes to people that are always negative.
All the time.
People that just live in this negative little world with their negative little comments.
They never have anything good to say.
Jeez, Rob, you're complaining a lot.
Shut up!
That was negative too!
No, but I'm serious.
I just say there's certain fun things that I like to do and the amount of negativity surrounding them is starting to suck the fun out of it.
It's nothing any of you are involved with.
Don't worry about it.
So it's kind of one of those things where I'm starting to get to my wits end and it's kind of like I might have to give it up because it's not fun anymore.
That's a bummer.
It's nothing to do with podcasting, y'all.
Don't start rumors.
Or Warcraft.
So it's just frustrating.
Anyhow, drama.
There's always drama somewheres.
But let's make things a little happier and get into the listless results!
Yay!
Results of tonight's list list.
This is it.
This is the definitive list, you guys.
Oh, we got a late vote.
I almost would not let this count.
However, I don't think it's going to change the final result here.
No, it does not.
All right.
The top three, and this is it, guys.
There is no disputing.
These are the three games you want to see them make out of toys.
Number three tonight, and it was a close one.
Number three tonight was Death Race, My Little Pony.
Woo!
Yay!
We want those ponies to fight to the death.
Your number two pick for game you most want to see them make out of an old toy.
Crossfire.
That's going to be interesting.
I don't know how that would be a video game.
You should find the commercial for Crossfire, Rob.
Didn't it have like a catchy little theme song to it?
I think it did.
Hold on.
I think somebody had posted it in chat.
Let me see if I can YouTube it real quick.
Here, hold on.
The getty caught in the crossfire.
Something like that.
It was retarded and funny at the same time.
And it had this red and blue background.
Okay, hold on.
Hold on, kids.
Here we go.
Coming soon to a video game store near you.
I found one of those at a thrift store.
God, the 80s were amazing.
Rob, with the label on it, Missing Balls.
It was like a year ago.
This game has no balls.
And the number one toy you most want to see turn into a game.
Come on, you guys know our audience.
What is it?
Light Bright DDR Yay, everyone get out the E in the sandstorm Everyone rave, coming soon Hugs, hugs everybody, hugs I made some candy because you're my friend you guys Let's hug, can we cuddle?
And then there's the make out room
No, it's the cuddle room.
It's not the make-out room.
Oh, you know that's what it's going to turn into later.
Did you ever go to... I want to say you went to one.
I just remember we both went to one or something.
No, I went to a roller skate rave.
I love Tracy Lords, I'm not even going to lie.
Oh yeah, and Sunscreen and all of those mid-90s dance music.
And there was activities going on in the outside because we couldn't do anything inside the rink.
Sorry, we needed a soundtrack to this.
But we had people in various states of intoxication on roller skates.
It was amazing.
Loki, did you ever go to a rave when you were younger?
No, but I had to clean up a rave.
And that's not much fun.
Apparently, they got the good idea to host a rave at the Cusar.
Oh, God.
And most people, I guess there was an orgy on the T-Mech machine, and there was also an orgy on the hard-driving machine, I think.
The nap machine.
Anyway, so they had that, but people started... How can you have an orgy in the hard drive then?
I don't know.
You can't fit more than one person in there.
I wasn't there.
But anyway, people were paying money to go inside the arena.
They weren't even really playing laser tag.
They were just staring at the colors from all the black lights.
So, uh, yeah, I missed out on that, unfortunately.
But I got to come in and clean it up afterwards, and that sucked.
so uh yeah so that rave was kind of dopey but the other one was like an outdoor kind of thing I don't even know where it was because I wasn't watching where we were driving and I had a lot of fun I have to I'm not gonna lie I had a lot you know for being like the E for being 20 I didn't do any of that and actually everybody really respected my wishes um to not get into doing any of that but um I'm not gonna lie um there was this guy who I think might have had some of the substances it was really hot and we just made out all night like I didn't I didn't need nothing to get me in the mood
I'm like, you're hot, that's drug enough for me.
Oh, Rob.
So that was the day.
And then actually, I kissed a girl at that same wave.
Ew!
I know, because she's, okay, this has nothing to do with games, but I don't even care, this is funny.
She took this book, or she had this book of everybody she'd ever made out with was in this book.
and uh she was on page 67 and i said i want to be page 69 in your book like i i have to like this is my new goal i want to be page 69 in your book and she's like well i'll make out with you but i have to have 68 first so i was like you make out with her
and so she made out with this random guy and then made out with me and then I was number 69 and then this is so terrible you guys don't do this at home then we decided we were all three gonna kiss and that's when I got introduced to three-way kissing which is really weird yeah it's it's there's certain things I can't say with my husband any other just kidding
So that was my raving experience.
It was a good time.
I've just done the roller rave.
It wasn't sex.
It was just kissing.
I've done the roller rave.
The roller rave was fun.
Because I drank a lot of beer.
And I can roller skate drunk.
All righty.
Let's move on.
Do not drink and roller skate.
It is a bigger disaster than drinking and driving.
Let's try to get back into some actual video game news.
Unless Loki wants to talk about three-way kissing.
I don't know.
I have no experience in that, I'm afraid.
Well, then I guess we'll have to go back to video game news.
I guess we're going to have to.
So there was concern with Harmonix being sold by MTV.
Who was going to buy them?
Was it going to be Activision?
God, let's hope it's not Activision.
But ironically enough, no one ever thought Harmonix may buy Harmonix.
And that's what happened.
Apparently our Harmonix, they've been purchased and they have an investment group.
Columbus Nova also took part in that.
They purchased them for $49.99 plus whatever debt they had.
So apparently they're going to...
take on their debts and stuff but Harmonix will assume responsibility over its liabilities and also includes music rights fees and responsibilities for lots of unsold games and equipment sitting on warehouse shelves also they're going to be able to keep the rights to Rock Band and Dent Central and will have control over those franchises so that's kind of cool
and Viacom's not doing too bad out of it.
Apparently the sale will reportedly net Viacom $150 million in tax benefits and considering it spent $175 million to buy the company in the first place, that's not bad.
Wow, so they're going to write off essentially on their taxes this year, Viacom.
I mean, Harmonix.
Viacom will write them off.
Wow.
Crazy.
I just hope that they can get the backing that they'll need to keep up with production and licensing and everything.
Where's the commercial on YouTube that's all QVC style where you can buy a video game publishing company for $49.99?
and the chicks who have no idea what they're talking about trying to explain it.
Have you ever watched them sell video games on QVC?
It makes my brain hurt.
It's so awesomely bad.
I don't watch TV, Rob.
Oh my God.
That should be a segment on our show.
I just watch Supernatural.
We're hard up for new segments on our show.
We need to start doing like QVC selling video games because it's hilarious how bad they are.
This game is called Shock Troopers and I think it's about getting electrocuted in the jungle while you're shooting guns.
This is a really fun game for the whole family.
And this game is called Resident Evil.
It's not bloody at all.
There's no zombies.
For you auto aficionados out here, Grand Theft Auto is perfect for you.
It has lots of cars in it.
And hookers.
I want to see really quick.
Do they have any on YouTube?
Hold on.
You know they've got everything on YouTube, Rob.
You're not going to have a problem.
Although, if you don't find anything, I will be surprised.
And there was the guy who broke the TV with the Wiimote on QVC.
Really?
That was pretty funny.
QVC Phineas and Ferb motion video game.
Phineas and Ferb is awesome!
I don't... This isn't actually a clip from QVC though.
I don't know.
Sadly, I don't... Chat room, you need to find me one so I can play it here on the show.
Okay, we got one more story for you guys and then we're going to open up the 877 number.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Ooh, actually, I need to make sure that the 800 number is still working because it actually may have ran out tonight and I forgot to recharge it.
Silent Hill Downpour
Yep, that's the new name of the game, Silent Hill Downpour.
There's new information about this game in the latest Game Informer.
Apparently the town is huge, and you're going to use a subway system to get from one part of the town to another.
There's going to be a never-before-seen southeastern side of Silent Hill.
There is no hospitals or schools in that area.
So they're trying something new.
There will be optional side quests apparently in the game as well.
Combat will be from more like the earlier Silent Hill games.
You can avoid a lot of encounters and it's advised to avoid encounters.
You can only carry one melee weapon at a time, such as an axe.
The enemies are very hard to kill.
The weapons break easily.
The only fights you have to do in the game are boss battles.
Water is going to be an essential part of the game There's apparently a room in the game that has upside down running water on the ceiling Puzzles will be back to scaling difficulty levels So you can have easy puzzles or super hard puzzles So that's kind of cool because it sounds like they're going back to their roots a little bit But it sounds like they're mixing a little bit of old Silent Hill with open world quest driven games Like, I don't know, Warcraft, Borderlands, that type of thing So that's kind of neat, I gotta say
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Actdeft in our chatroom says Silent Hill Downhill more like it.
Is that like the last game except they're replacing the snow with lots of rain?
I would have to give it a try.
I would have to give it a chance.
I've given the other ones a chance.
I'd have to give this a chance.
Because, I mean, Silent Hill, you know.
DDR Dollar Bill says Silent Hill Signs Edition.
I do like the idea of having the open universe so maybe me too maybe that will be the redeeming factor who knows what do you most want to see in a new Silent Hill game do you think they ought to just go back to Silent Hill 2 I want to see it produced by Konami in Japan that's what I most want to see
That's what it needs is to be back.
They need to beg Yamaoka to come back and they need to just get it back done the way they were doing them before.
They were doing them well.
Why did they screw up?
They shouldn't have ever sent the franchise to the U.S.
I mean as far as to be developed in the U.S.
That's what I'm saying.
It doesn't have the same feel anymore.
All right.
We are going to open up the Skype line right now Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR It does look like the number is working but the message I think is broken so if you call you're not going to get that little You've reached Orange Lounge Radio message line It's some generic thing right now so we'll look at that after the show why that's going on but otherwise you can give us a call right now 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Now there is a bit of delay between live and when the folks can actually start calling so I'll ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories
Yes, there's some new stuff developing on the 3D side of the PlayStation Network.
Apparently, they're going to start offering some 3D movies available on their service.
And one of those 3D movies is, yes, the 3D swimsuit video via, I believe, Sports Illustrated.
So you will be able to get 3D boobs on the PlayStation 3.
Not quite porn, but hey, whatever.
It's Cinemax-style porn.
Yes.
I don't know if you've seen this yet, Rob.
This is kind of scary.
Another Kinect hack.
Some guy has actually programmed the Kinect to allow him to play around with the figure of
Ivy from Soul Calibur with boob physics.
Well, lack of boob physics, but Soul Calibur boob physics, so he can move around with her boobs bouncing around.
Yay, boob simulations.
All right, we got a call coming in, so let's go to that real quick.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, it's D.D.
Odd Dollar Bill.
D.D.
Odd Dollar Bill.
How are you doing, my friend?
I'm doing all right, man.
Doing all right.
All right.
What's on your mind?
Uh, pretty much I was trying to send an email out to you guys, but I kept, I was trying to do it to the website, but I kept getting rejected.
So I figured, let me just call up and explain what's going on.
Weird, I don't know why the website's rejecting, but you know, the website had some major issues last week.
I guess some people started spamming our photo feed.
I missed, I totally missed this.
Like, Actdeft and Deekman took care of it when I wasn't listening.
But, uh, or watching, I should say.
But I guess, like, people were putting, like, weird, like, porno things in the picture feed.
And, uh...
You know I've threatened to pull the plug before if that shit starts happening.
However, I realize there's no one that actually listens to this show's fault.
But we have to keep an eye on that now.
So some of the things with the website might have got tweaked because of that.
Anyhow, what's on your mind?
Pretty much this is probably going to be the year that I'm going to really just stop gaming.
Video gaming.
What?
Why is that?
well the other day a couple days ago I was going to I was just listening to some old Nintendo games like some music you know the NSF files the emulators and I was just going back like what are some of the best things I remember about games and quite honestly today's games don't have any excitement to it they just there's nothing really exciting about playing them anymore there's no games that get you excited anymore what type okay let me ask you this what type of old Nintendo games did you like
Some memories, let's see.
I actually love the original Ninja Gaiden, for example, the trilogy.
Okay.
I love that.
Blaster Master was another popular one.
I agree.
That new Blaster Master game they made a little while ago wasn't nearly as good as the old one.
It was really unfortunate.
Oof, I haven't tried that yet.
But, yeah, like, what was another one I tried?
I mean, I can go to Genesis games like Phantasy Star 2, for example.
Those things gave me great memories.
They made me want to play it through no matter how bullshit hard it got.
They were just fantastic, those games.
Recently, no game really has actually grabbed my attention.
Maybe just one, but how many games get released a year?
That's a bad number.
Out of curiosity, what's the one game that grabbed your attention?
Red Dead Redemption.
Oh, okay.
Well, that was a pretty solid game.
Interesting.
And you know what?
You seem to really like exploring in games because a lot of those games you name, they all have to do something like you explore and you find new things as you go through the world.
Especially something like Red Dead Redemption is a lot about exploration.
So it sounds like these kind of open world games might kind of be your thing.
I don't know.
I'm just kind of guessing.
But what about like...
New games that kind of call back that retro style.
And I mean things like Bionic Commando Rearmed, we talked about earlier in the show.
It has a new release coming out.
Super Meat Boy, awesome throwback to retro games.
No interest there?
Okay, for Bionic Commando Rearmed, I loved that.
I eventually beat it, and it was a satisfying experience.
I really loved it.
Especially since I loved Bionic Commando since the arcade edition.
which most people are going to be like, there was an arcade?
I seem to recall one, I do.
And not even just the PayChoice10 one.
I think there was actually like a, I seem to recall what you're talking about.
Yeah, like that one.
Super Meat Boy is actually a very, very interesting case.
I tried a demo of it and I liked it but at the same time my thoughts were
Do I really want to go through the harder levels for reward that I'm not going to really enjoy?
I mean, you know, it's like, am I going to play this difficult game for the sake of it being difficult?
Or am I going to play it because I actually enjoy it?
You know, I see a comment in our chatroom, and I think this is a darn good piece of advice for you.
And Azam in our chatroom says, Someone get this man a near-lethal dose of indie gaming stat.
Maybe you're just fed up with what's in the mainstream and a lot of those games that, you know, cost $60 to find out a game sucks.
Have you thought about turning to the indie side of things a little bit?
Maybe exploring a little more what Steam or the Xbox Live Indie Arcades has?
on it.
Ah, that's another good point you guys bring up.
That's another point I was going to bring up because, yes, I've actually turned to indie gaming and I can tell you one other game that actually really caught my interest and I didn't really mention this and I got it remembering.
Amnesia.
You ever heard of it?
Yes, I have.
I have heard of Amnesia.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I mean Super Meat Boy of sorts is an indie game as well there's a lot of these indie packs that are available on Steam I don't know you know it's not as cheap now as they were at Christmas time but things where you can get like you know kind of like a sampling of different types of games pretty cheap the humble indie bundle was out recently you know maybe there's more to look for in there where you don't feel like you're getting a shafted with the money you're spending
especially when it's like you can't really play much demos these days.
Absolutely.
Well, DDR Dollar Bill, I hope you find something to kind of change your mind a little bit.
There's so many types of games out there, but maybe it's just not going to be a AAA game from the developer.
But at the same time, you liked Red Dead Redemption, so I wouldn't look away completely from what the mainstream is doing because they'll be more like Red Dead soon, trust me.
Yeah, I guess it's just the start of the year, so I'll give it a chance.
That's true.
I think it'll be okay.
All right, DDR Dollar Bureau, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks for giving us a call.
Good topic.
No problem.
Later, guys.
Later.
All right, good call.
Let's go to another one.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, what's up, guys?
This is Taijudo.
Taijudo.
What's on your mind, buddy?
No, no.
Before I go into what I want to talk about, I just wanted to recommend...
Game.
Well, not actually a game, but what you guys were doing earlier where you were combining toys with games.
Yeah, yeah, what's that?
How about a chase in Will Warriors with the burnout engine?
Dude, sweet!
I like that.
You know, I'm kind of surprised we didn't get something in that whole racing game theme because there was so much good racing stuff.
You know, I did consider for a moment a Power Wheels racing game.
That thought did cross my mind, but I like your idea a lot.
Yeah, don't forget about Mask.
That was also great.
I don't know about the cartoon, but the toys were great.
But on to what I was going to talk about...
I don't know if there's still any people out there that were interested in the agency MMO that was supposed to come out like eons ago.
Yeah, whatever happened to that?
You guys remember this game?
You've been following this?
It's supposed to still, supposedly it's still in development.
I mean, I doubt that.
I mean, it's been a long time since we've heard anything from it.
But according to a lot of sources, they're all saying that the game's still coming out on PlayStation 3 and the PC, supposedly the PC before the PS3.
But I don't know.
That's kind of shaky.
But I do have some good news for people.
Who may be still interested in that game There's a Facebook app Made by the developers of that game That you can actually play now It's kind of like Mafia Wars You know, the whole tech space type deal But it's a lot of fun, the presentation is really great And I'm enjoying it Awesome So, I might have missed it Have they nailed a release window for this yet?
Or does it need to go through the extensive testing first?
That, I don't know I mean, you guys can look that up Um
As far as I know, they're reworking the game.
They weren't satisfied with what they originally had, the stuff that they were showing at E3.
And they're supposedly rebuilding a whole other type of game.
Because for whatever their reasons are,
I just hope they didn't take out the feature where there was supposed to be some feature where...
You could actually play the game through your cell phone.
You were supposed to take on these little, I guess you would call them microagents, and they were supposed to build cars and gadgets for you, and you were supposed to be able to manage that through your cell phone somehow.
I thought that was a great idea.
I like the fact that they were taking MMO in another direction, so hopefully they're not coming out with just something like APB, where you're just running and gunning, and a whole lot of BS.
I really like that idea of interacting with the cell phones more and other types of things like that.
I think that's a really good use of... Sorry about that.
Somebody sent me a YouTube link.
I brought it up a little soon.
Sorry, that totally threw me.
Way to go!
I know, gosh, sorry about that.
But that's kind of the way games like Warcraft and so forth are going where they're fully interactive with all these different types of platforms like the mobile phones and everything.
Yeah, I think that's the way to go.
Like I said, I don't know if you remember what I called last week and I'm all about game innovation and I kind of agree with your previous caller that games need to be a little more innovative.
I mean, I'm not going to quit gaming anytime soon
but they do need to come out with something more than just Call of Duty and all the other bullshit that they're coming out with.
I want them to really take advantage of what we have now.
We have motion control crap, we have HD crap.
There's just so much that they can do with it.
I know that it's a whole money management thing and there's a memory thing and there's a lot of balancing things that you have to do with the games but I know that they can do a lot better than what they're doing now.
They can at least try Alright Alright, well we'll be keeping an eye on this game It does appear they're still targeting the second half of 2011 for this But it'll be done when it's done, darn it Yeah, and oh, that name of the app is The Agency Covert Ops Look for that on Facebook, that's the name of it That is available on Facebook And looks like it's been up since May of last year Missions, minigames, and sharing achievements with Facebook friends
I'm going to hang up and let the next caller come in.
Some stuff coming out of CES.
They're talking a little bit about Avatar Connect, which is going to be kind of a new chat method that you can use to actually chat with people and recognize facial expressions and stuff like that.
So kind of mapping your voice to your avatar, which is kind of neat.
and they'll be available for gold numbers later this spring.
You'll use it once and then the thrill will be over.
But I do like the idea like you can like publish it to Facebook and stuff.
I'll bet you we're going to start seeing podcasts recorded like this.
We should do an episode of OLR like this, like a bonus episode of OLR.
That would be funny.
That would be kind of funny.
That's like the one thing we have to do and then that'll be it.
And the other thing, I don't know if this pissed you off, Rob.
They're talking about bringing Game Room to the Windows Phone 7.
TurboGrafx Games coming to the Playstation Network
So you can play games like Keith Courage that weren't very good.
Yeah, these are from Hudson.
Don't get me started.
Alien Crush, Bomberman 94, Box Adventure.
Some of them were good.
Dungeon Explorer, New Adventure Islands, Soldier Blades, Superstar Soldier, Victory Run, World Sports Competition, and Newtopia.
All right, I got a call waiting.
Newtopia is a great game, and it's a lot like Zelda.
Let me go to the phones.
Haven't you done a classic game of the week?
I think I have done Newtopia.
Let me go to the phones because I got somebody waiting.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is X-Link.
Hey, X-Link.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Hey, nothing much.
You know, sometimes games and stuff, sometimes I can understand the other color a while back.
I mean, there's been times when I step back from playing video games for a while because, you know, you get burned out.
You play stuff, you know, you think a lot of stuff comes out.
It's the same thing.
It's, you know, you know, I take a few days off, maybe read some books.
You know, they come back and do something else.
But, you know,
I'm sure there's something out there for a little bit for everyone and yeah and as I was telling you earlier they should make Millie Bourne into another PC game if they I mean I know there was one a long time ago but I think they should make that into another one I have a indie app on my iTouch that I bought from the store that was 99 cents that was kind of the card game though it's not the official version but it plays the same way which is really cool
You know, I like playing all kinds of different stuff.
Roleplaying, card games, you know, games like Super Meat Boy, Nick's Quest was another good one I had played for a bit, you know, first person shooters.
So when I get bored of one thing, I kind of switch it around to another thing so that way I don't get too burnt out on playing one genre of a
That's not bad advice at all.
And especially, you know, with thanks to the magic of emulators, or I'm sorry, virtual console, you know, you can have a variety of different games, you know, especially the old school stuff, you know, because that's what our listener seemed to enjoy that you can go back and forth to.
You know, one odd suggestion maybe I would have for that listener, and maybe this is one of those things where I'll get laughed out of the room.
but maybe that person should try an MMO maybe if games were a little more social I don't know like for me like WoW being the big social thing it is kind of keeps me is what keeps me coming back to that game but at the same time and there's a lot of free ones too there's I mean I used to play before I played WoW I played a Persona one that they had that was totally free so I mean
You don't have to really pay to play, so to speak.
There's a lot of free stuff out there.
It might be another niche or something else totally different out there.
I don't think there's anything wrong, though, with the advice of, if you think you're bored of video games, take a break.
There's nothing wrong with it.
You don't have to game every single day.
I'm not going to think any less of you.
None of us will.
That's not true, but that's all right.
Stop.
Go watch some movies or catch up on TV shows.
Go read a book.
Go start another project.
And then maybe you'll find that game that wants to bring you back.
You know, it's kind of interesting, too, when you're talking about this whole, you know, about being lazy and stuff.
It's because mostly because technology.
Our technology has grown so rapidly, so quickly, and it's so easy to access a lot of different stuff so quickly.
Like,
Why do I need to go to the library to check out a book?
I can go online and buy the book straight from Amazon and get it right here in my own living room.
Unfortunately, with technology, there's always pros and cons to everything.
Unfortunately, a pro thing is it's quicker and easier, but a con is that we don't do as much as we used to.
We get to a point in society now it's like we want things almost virtually handed to us because we're like, well, we can get this this way.
Why can't we do this?
I've got to admit I've bought a book on my iPhone before and one of the reasons I kind of like that sort of technology is that I have the book with me everywhere I go in case I'm ever bored.
That way I'm not carrying around a bulky book.
That's kind of the one really advantage I like of having it on there.
But I do also understand, you know, there's really no substitute for an old dusty book.
Yeah.
So, I mean, but, you know, I still read books.
I have plenty of books on my shelf that I read that's actual physical books.
I mean, you know, not everything is the e-book.
It's clearly my strategy guides.
I mean, I have a lot of limited edition strategy guides that I like to have just for, you know, collector's edition just for, you know, to have on my shelves because I like looking at them.
So, I mean, you know, so, I mean, there's...
It's kind of funny when you're saying that because that brought me back to the whole thing back when I was taking technology ed class in high school and we're talking about, you know, because of all these pros there's going to be cons, you know, like fast food and movies and now we got books and video games and, you know, we don't have to do as much as we used to to get what we want.
It's okay, I press a few buttons or click on a few things and boom, there it is, so.
Boom, there it is.
That's definitely the culture we live in now.
Alright, X-Link, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for the call as always.
And how proud are you of Jamie and her level 63?
I'm very proud of her.
30 levels in one week.
Jesus, I can't do anything more.
You might get explicit for it.
Yeah, but, yeah, damn.
That's all I'm going to say is damn.
I couldn't believe that.
30 levels in almost a week.
That was just amazing.
That really, congratulations.
Thank you.
And thank you as well for the gift.
I don't want to say anything.
Play a game how you want to play a game.
That's fine.
But just for you to blow through 30 levels in a week just kind of made me laugh a little bit because I'm just kind of like, man, I know other people that are just like they don't even do a level a month.
I'm still going to see if it's possible for me to make 85 before classes start next week.
Well, it took me to get, it almost took me a year to get to 80, but that's only because I was only playing a few times a week, and I was just doing it a few hours a day.
But then again, how was I getting to 82, Rob, again, when I got Kata?
Archeology whoring.
That's right, there we go.
Non-stop.
So, yeah, that was a lot of fun.
You guys are going to have to show me the ropes.
Oh, I will.
The one thing, though, is that, and this is, I think, what chased me off before, is the whole feeling like I'm being forced to play with people.
You know?
Just do whatever you want to do.
Like I said before, you had to open the invitation to our raids on Wednesday, and if you want to, that's fine.
If you don't, you don't.
There's no right or wrong.
Well, no.
I understand that.
I've been getting the, oh, the whole game experience is when you're playing with doing, you know, the dungeon thing with a lot of people, and...
I'm like, I've been enjoying playing by myself.
I like playing with one or two people.
Really quickly, and I'm not going to say too much on this because I know people are going to get shut off, but just like, oh shit, they're talking about WoW.
Rob invited me to WoW a year ago, and when I started playing, I thought for sure that it was going to be kind of like, okay, Rob's going to show me ropes, and I'm going to do all this stuff, and this is going to be great, and blah, blah, blah.
And I know Rob had his own thing.
He was really busy with work and whatnot.
Rob contestants, there were times when I had played with them, but for the most part, between me getting to 1 in 80...
was, other than the help from another guildie of ours, whoever my name was, that I did 90% of that stuff on my own.
I went through, I went through all the pugging stuff, through the dungeons and everything else, but for most parts, I did non-stop questing from day one when I started to when I got to like 80.
Among a few odds and ends and PvP and whatnot, but
I had a lot of fun playing by myself.
That's one of the few games I can actually say.
You can play by yourself and have a lot of fun doing it.
That's what I like.
I need to play with six of my friends in order to get this done.
But it is fun to play with your friends, too.
That's what keeps me in WoW is raiding.
Definitely, by far.
Alright, well, anyhow, I gotta let you go before we have Horde House to spin off here, but thank you so much for your call, okay, buddy?
Anytime, anytime.
Later.
I think pretty soon, especially when you hit about maybe level 70 or so, we're gonna have to, well, maybe soon, we'll have to run you into some dungeons and show you the ropes in dungeons.
I just want to basically learn how to play with other people so if I decide that I want to be social, that I'm not going to kill everybody.
Because I have a problem of accidentally casting my area of effect.
The dark side of pug groups is that they're not always noob friendly and they expect that you know everything and you may not and that's very unfortunate.
But anyway, let's move on.
I don't want to get too far into wild talk.
All right.
That's going to do it, though, for the Skype line tonight.
Thank you guys so much for your calls.
Really appreciate it.

She just came waddling out.
That's right.
Now she's just sitting there waiting to poop.
Hey, baby cakes.
All right.
Can you say something to everybody?
Let's talk about the tester.
Say something to the listeners, baby.
I don't think Shermie is very talkative.

Get that out of my face.
No comment.
All right.

Drunk show.
You never know what antics might, if I could get a ride home somehow.
You can sleep on the couch.
You never know what antics might happen.
You can sleep in the vault and freeze.
Do you want to do a drunk show next week that bad?
Will you drink?
I know he won't.
He can't.
He's got to be a responsible daddy, but will you?
Maybe I will.
Okay.
Because it's been that long, I will get nice and toasty on air for listeners if I can figure out a ride home or something.
Okay.
So maybe I'll see if somebody can drive me to the show.
We'll see.
