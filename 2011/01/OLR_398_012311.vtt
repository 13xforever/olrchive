00:00.000 --> 00:20.400
Tonight, January 23rd, 2011, the 3DS US launch gets some details, Final Fantasy games get

00:20.400 --> 00:25.400
sequels and new names, and after over a decade we finally have a release date for Duke Nukem

00:25.400 --> 00:26.400
Forever.

00:26.400 --> 00:35.280
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:35.280 --> 00:39.000
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.040
We are live with our 398th episode on this January 23rd, 2011.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.720
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you every week.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.640
With me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

00:52.640 --> 00:53.640
Hi.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.640
How are you, Dark Sakura?

00:54.640 --> 00:55.640
I have hobbit shoes.

00:55.640 --> 00:56.640
How are you?

00:56.640 --> 00:57.640
Am I not hearing you at all?

00:57.640 --> 00:58.640
Am I muted?

00:58.640 --> 00:59.640
The fabulousness of live radio.

00:59.640 --> 01:00.640
Try again.

01:00.640 --> 01:01.640
La, la, la.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.640
Much better.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.640
Okay.

01:03.640 --> 01:04.640
I'm wearing my hobbit shoes.

01:04.640 --> 01:05.640
What is the hobbit shoes?

01:05.640 --> 01:08.040
I have Vibram five finger multi-sport shoes.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.800
They're the shoes that look like feet.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
They're not really shoes.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.800
I'll take a picture.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.160
They're like Spiderman webbing that go on your feet and they're the strangest things.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.160
They're foot gloves.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.280
They're the strangest things I've ever seen.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.840
But they're comfortable and when they break in they're supposed to be really good for

01:20.840 --> 01:22.560
your feet and give you a natural stride.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.880
Would you play DDR in those?

01:23.880 --> 01:24.880
Yeah.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
Yeah.

01:25.880 --> 01:26.880
I've seen people do it before.

01:26.880 --> 01:27.880
Might be interesting.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.880
But I'm gonna take a...

01:28.880 --> 01:29.880
Play some Dance Central.

01:29.880 --> 01:30.880
Shake your booty.

01:30.880 --> 01:31.880
I'm not gonna play Dance Central.

01:31.880 --> 01:32.880
I'm gonna play Dance Masters.

01:32.880 --> 01:33.880
Really?

01:33.880 --> 01:34.880
You wouldn't...

01:34.880 --> 01:35.880
Oh, Dance Central's great.

01:35.880 --> 01:36.880
Hara-para.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.600
Dance Masters gets old after like the first five songs you play.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.600
I don't care.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.600
Don't care.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.600
All right.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.600
Whatever.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
Let's see if Tech Master Loki cares.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.600
Hi, Loki.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.600
I don't care about Dance Masters.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.600
And we don't hear you either.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600
What is going on?

01:48.600 --> 01:49.840
It's called ill preparation.

01:49.840 --> 01:50.840
Apparently.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.680
I don't know what this is all about tonight.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.160
Plus that mic.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.160
Everyone's up with it.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.160
I don't know.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.160
You've been getting quieter and quieter every week.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.560
It's because I'm talking quieter and quieter.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.160
They get really loud!

02:00.160 --> 02:01.360
Exactly.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.160
That's why we have to be careful how we tune it for you.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.160
I do that on purpose.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.160
All right.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.160
Well, how's your week been, Loki?

02:06.160 --> 02:07.160
It's been fine.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.160
Yeah?

02:08.160 --> 02:09.160
Good times.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.960
Anything exciting going on with the baby?

02:10.960 --> 02:11.960
Growing?

02:11.960 --> 02:12.960
Getting older?

02:12.960 --> 02:13.960
He's eating some...

02:13.960 --> 02:15.960
He's starting solid foods, I guess.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.800
I saw the avocado post.

02:17.800 --> 02:23.040
He's eating avocado, rice cereal, and...

02:23.040 --> 02:24.120
What else?

02:24.120 --> 02:26.640
When's it okay to start feeding a baby bacon?

02:26.640 --> 02:27.640
Not for a long time.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.200
Oh, what a bummer.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.200
He's getting...

02:30.200 --> 02:32.200
Well, it's avocado, rice cereal, and...

02:32.200 --> 02:33.200
Cheerios!

02:33.200 --> 02:36.800
I think that's actually it, avocado and rice cereal.

02:36.800 --> 02:41.320
But then he's going to be eating, I think, carrots this week.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.320
All right.

02:42.320 --> 02:45.000
Well, good luck in the baby adventures.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.840
Anyhow, we're going to get into how we always like to start off the show.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.000
How was your gaming week?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.240
But first, of course, I want to introduce the chat room.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.260
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com with us here every week.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.800
The always present fourth guest on the show, as we say.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.360
And lots of people making the connection.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.200
I'd written a tweet about this earlier on my Twitter account.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.240
Episode number 400, the way things are right now, will end up being the same day as the

03:06.240 --> 03:07.400
Super Bowl.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.560
That's just great.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.560
That's just fabulous.

03:10.560 --> 03:14.560
Our 400th episode is going to be the same day as the Super Bowl.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.600
I don't know if we really have anything exciting planned, though.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.600
I mean, it's just...

03:17.600 --> 03:18.600
I don't know.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.600
It's just...

03:19.600 --> 03:20.600
After this long...

03:20.600 --> 03:21.840
I have something exciting planned.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.240
I know you've got a little, a little something.

03:24.240 --> 03:28.160
But both of you need to actually stay instead of depart super quick after the show.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.720
I've offered, I don't know how many times, but anyway.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.800
You're not the one I'm worried about, Loki.

03:33.800 --> 03:39.160
All right, but anyway, besides all that stuff, 400 is coming up.

03:39.160 --> 03:43.080
And I don't know if we're doing anything too exciting, special.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.280
You know, I don't know.

03:44.280 --> 03:49.480
After however long we've been doing the show, nine years or whatever, the self-congratulatory

03:49.480 --> 03:51.580
episodes, there's been enough of them.

03:51.580 --> 03:52.580
So we'll see.

03:52.580 --> 03:56.080
500 is the really big deal, or 10 years, whatever comes first, which I guess would actually

03:56.080 --> 03:57.340
be 10 years.

03:57.340 --> 03:58.600
But anyway, enough of that.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.400
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games you have been playing

04:01.400 --> 04:02.400
this week.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.400
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

04:04.400 --> 04:09.200
Um, I made level 75 on World of Warcraft.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.760
And got two of my friends to play.

04:11.760 --> 04:12.760
Addict.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.160
Now I'm the dealer.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.160
Um...

04:16.160 --> 04:20.120
That's what pyramid scheme I say.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.120
Pyramid head scheme.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.120
Ah.

04:22.120 --> 04:26.000
And, uh, I played some Portal.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.840
And uh, some more Mushihime-sama.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.840
And lots of Solitaire.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.300
Because I was at school.

04:34.300 --> 04:40.320
And I updated and installed my own Linux Mint 10 by myself.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.000
On two computers.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.480
And fixed the networking problems.

04:43.480 --> 04:47.860
Now, I know I've heard you talk favorably of Linux Mint before as something you like

04:47.860 --> 04:51.600
to use as another OS besides just, you know, Windows.

04:51.600 --> 04:57.040
What is the advantage, I guess, of doing Linux on one system and Windows on the other?

04:57.040 --> 05:03.080
Specifically in the case of my netbook, it uses less memory and less space.

05:03.080 --> 05:10.080
And if I need to, I can actually boot it off of a USB that I've installed Linux on.

05:10.080 --> 05:15.960
So say that, you know, this computer that I'm on now, say that something goes haywire

05:15.960 --> 05:20.960
in it, all I have to do is boot it off of Linux and I can run through the file system.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.300
And if I need to delete something, I can.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.420
Good times.

05:24.420 --> 05:25.420
It works on everything.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.420
Well, it makes sense.

05:26.420 --> 05:29.880
Uh, there's some folks in our chat room talking about episode 400, by the way.

05:29.880 --> 05:33.420
SalaciousPop in our chat room says, episode 400 is going to be a drunk show, I thought.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.420
That's right.

05:34.420 --> 05:35.420
We had mentioned something about that, hadn't we?

05:35.420 --> 05:36.420
Yes, we have.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.420
Perhaps.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.420
Maybe that will happen.

05:38.420 --> 05:39.420
Um...

05:39.420 --> 05:43.720
And then, uh, SSJ100Matt says, we need Rice Princess and Extifer for episode 400.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.720
We'll see.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.160
We invite them, they'll make it all about them.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.560
If you listen to Hoard House, you'll know, so.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.560
We'll see.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.560
We'll see.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.560
Nothing is impossible.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.880
So that's it for Dark Soccer's Gaming Week.

05:53.880 --> 05:54.880
We'll move on over to Loki.

05:54.880 --> 05:55.880
How was your gaming week?

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
Um, it was okay.

05:56.880 --> 06:03.720
I played a couple things, um, I tried, I don't know, just for the hell of it, I tried that

06:03.720 --> 06:08.800
one, um, free game that was made by that 14-year-old or something like that, some bubble something

06:08.800 --> 06:10.160
or other.

06:10.160 --> 06:15.400
And, um, it was okay for a few minutes and then I was like, wow, this looks like a really

06:15.400 --> 06:17.160
cheaply made game.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.600
And I got bored with it.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.600
Why do you think it's doing so well?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.200
This is that iPhone, iTouch game.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.160
I hope because people like fucking human interest stories and because people are simpletons

06:25.160 --> 06:29.920
and they like free shit and as long as it has a good storyteacher, well, I better support

06:29.920 --> 06:31.920
it because the 14-year-old made it.

06:31.920 --> 06:32.920
Great.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.760
You know, 14-year-olds make a lot of shit.

06:35.760 --> 06:36.760
Usually.

06:36.760 --> 06:37.760
Yeah.

06:37.760 --> 06:42.120
Um, but, you know, whatever, you know, these are the same people like Angry Birds, so,

06:42.120 --> 06:50.760
you know, one of my, it's not a stretch for them, I guess, um, then I, I literally dusted

06:50.760 --> 06:55.280
off my PS3, uh, to finally put the 500, those things are dust magnets.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.520
You don't dust them off, they'll turn gray.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.520
Yeah.

07:00.520 --> 07:07.960
So, um, I dusted it off and I finally installed my 500 gig hard drive that I had for it and

07:07.960 --> 07:15.040
then I, um, did the noble thing and I installed a custom firmware on it and now all my systems

07:15.040 --> 07:17.600
are modded as they should be.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.760
You're so proud.

07:18.760 --> 07:24.680
It was seriously the black sheep of the bunch and, you know, now, now it's all perfect.

07:24.680 --> 07:29.640
And I know I've read stories about systems bricking and stuff like that, but seriously,

07:29.640 --> 07:35.120
if you just wait a little bit to make sure everything's okay, let the dust settle, you're

07:35.120 --> 07:36.120
all good.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.040
And it's so easy to do, it's seriously scary.

07:40.040 --> 07:47.280
Um, so I did that and then, um, played a little bit of Planet 2, a little bit of that, um,

07:47.280 --> 07:53.360
just a few levels and then a couple, actually just one online level and, um, it's fun.

07:53.360 --> 07:58.200
I like Little Big Planet 1, I mean, that was a fun game, and Little Big Planet 2, obviously

07:58.200 --> 08:01.360
very similar to that, they have some new features that they added in there.

08:01.360 --> 08:07.000
I don't really care for the grappling hook too much and, and I don't know if it's just

08:07.000 --> 08:12.600
the design of the, you know, Dualshock 3 analog sticks or something like that, but for some

08:12.600 --> 08:17.520
reason I was having issues with it trying to, you know, swing my character back and

08:17.520 --> 08:23.000
forth and having the grappling hook, you know, change length, which would normally be controlled

08:23.000 --> 08:27.360
by the up and down on the analog, even though I'm not pushing up and down on the analog,

08:27.360 --> 08:34.280
it was just very, the dead zones for it were really, um, really large, I guess.

08:34.280 --> 08:39.680
So it was difficult to accurately get it to swing and adjust the, you know, size of the

08:39.680 --> 08:41.460
grappling hook and stuff like that.

08:41.460 --> 08:46.160
So it actually killed my character one time, but it's alright, it's kind of cool.

08:46.160 --> 08:50.520
And then I played someone's user recreated levels, the first person shooter Resident

08:50.520 --> 08:55.580
Evil thing, and that was actually kind of cool, um, definitely different and a good

08:55.580 --> 08:59.840
indicator of what you can do with, um, Little Big Planet 2, and then there was also like

08:59.840 --> 09:05.240
a top down RPG game that someone made, um, which I tried out, that was pretty cool.

09:05.240 --> 09:10.120
So, um, lots of unique stuff and I like how they're kind of hinting at some of the things

09:10.120 --> 09:14.680
that you can do in like the first few levels, like they have the ability where you can link

09:14.680 --> 09:18.880
two different levels together or more than two levels together, so like for example say

09:18.880 --> 09:22.560
you wanted to create, you know, like a Mario Brothers game, you can do that, you can create

09:22.560 --> 09:24.760
all the different levels and then just link them all together.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.080
And I'm sure it's only a matter of time before somebody does create Mario Brothers in Little

09:28.080 --> 09:29.080
Big Planet.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
It's probably already happened, actually.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.280
Oh, I'm sure it already has.

09:32.280 --> 09:38.240
But it's really cool, I mean, I really, I've been trying to play it for like the longest

09:38.240 --> 09:43.880
time, but you know, trying to be able to play a game on my big TV, um, it's not really working

09:43.880 --> 09:44.880
out for me.

09:44.880 --> 09:49.120
Thankfully though, and this will also kind of help out with, if I have to ever stream

09:49.120 --> 09:54.400
DJ Hero 3 or something, I have a new capture card for my laptop that I can just plug into

09:54.400 --> 09:58.760
USB, so it allows me to play games and just hook straight up to my laptop and I can play

09:58.760 --> 10:04.560
it off the screen, no lag, so, um, that'll give me an additional screen to play Little

10:04.560 --> 10:05.560
Big Planet on.

10:05.560 --> 10:09.640
Go into our chatroom at chat.orangelandscreeter.com, there's some people that are asking about

10:09.640 --> 10:15.640
your hacking habits, uh, BlackWolf says, now you never have to pay for another game, yay!

10:15.640 --> 10:19.080
Which is a very tongue-in-cheek comment from BlackWolf because he's actually very anti-video

10:19.080 --> 10:20.080
game piracy.

10:20.080 --> 10:24.480
Uh, but, Loki, you do still buy games, you bought, what, like seven copies of Grand Theft

10:24.480 --> 10:27.520
Auto IV on various systems or something?

10:27.520 --> 10:30.840
And, uh, it's not like you don't pay for games.

10:30.840 --> 10:35.200
Uh, so then, I guess this leads to the question from AkumaJP, Loki, what is the benefit of

10:35.200 --> 10:37.840
custom firmware for the PS3?

10:37.840 --> 10:38.840
Lots of things.

10:38.840 --> 10:42.360
One, um, you can play all the different homebrew stuff that they have on there.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.280
You can add different features to your system.

10:45.280 --> 10:49.200
It's just really early, so a lot of the stuff we don't know yet what you're gonna be able

10:49.200 --> 10:54.840
to do with it, but, um, yes, there's definitely the backing up portion of it that you can

10:54.840 --> 11:00.980
back up games and, you know, pirate stuff if you want to, um, will I do that?

11:00.980 --> 11:05.320
Probably not, because I had the ability to jailbreak my PS3 for the longest time, I actually

11:05.320 --> 11:10.560
had the tools to do it, but, I just didn't, there was no reason, like, I literally sat

11:10.560 --> 11:14.600
there going, well, I could do this and pirate a bunch of games, but, there's no real games

11:14.600 --> 11:15.600
I wanna play!

11:15.600 --> 11:21.480
I mean, so, it's like, that's sad, I mean, if I really don't wanna, you know, if there's

11:21.480 --> 11:25.120
nothing I really wanna play on there, then, I don't know, but.

11:25.120 --> 11:28.480
As long as I've known you and as long as I've been doing this show with you, you've always

11:28.480 --> 11:31.200
kind of been the type to me that just likes to do it because you can.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.880
Like, you know, because somebody's like, you're not supposed to hack your PS3 to be able to

11:34.880 --> 11:40.320
run this, and you're very much the type that's like, well, yes I can, you know, I'm gonna

11:40.320 --> 11:42.240
do it anyway, and then it is.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.240
Pretty much, yeah.

11:43.240 --> 11:48.080
So, alright, anyhow, is that it for your gaming week?

11:48.080 --> 11:54.480
Oh, I wanted to ask you something about Little Big Planet 2, excuse me, Little Big Planet

11:54.480 --> 11:58.320
2, what was, kind of, you mentioned there's some new features and so forth, what was one

11:58.320 --> 12:01.800
of the first things that jumped at you that you noticed was different about the game from

12:01.800 --> 12:03.640
Little Big Planet 1?

12:03.640 --> 12:11.080
Um, I mean, the springboards, I guess, that was like the first thing that they show that's

12:11.080 --> 12:12.080
different.

12:12.080 --> 12:18.040
Um, I like, it did import my character and all my stuff that they had collected in the

12:18.040 --> 12:20.480
first game, which is kind of cool.

12:20.480 --> 12:26.240
Um, I don't know, there's not a lot right now that's different, it's just a few different

12:26.240 --> 12:30.960
things, but I mean, I know that the game is gonna be really, because it's kind of, I'm

12:30.960 --> 12:35.080
still going through the first few levels of the game where the tutorial levels, you know,

12:35.080 --> 12:40.640
so they haven't really introduced a ton of stuff yet, it's just very much like the first

12:40.640 --> 12:46.680
game right now, um, but that's alright, because the first game was awesome.

12:46.680 --> 12:51.160
Um, I did, I do like how they had some voice acting in the game, like the cut scenes, the

12:51.160 --> 12:56.840
cut scenes are actually, um, very unique, um, and then also I like how, and I'm not

12:56.840 --> 13:01.820
sure if the Da Vinci character or whatever is voiced by John Cleese, but it sounds like

13:01.820 --> 13:06.160
it, and then later on, because they only have voice acting through the cut scenes, through

13:06.160 --> 13:10.640
the rest of the game, he's just kind of mumbling, it sounds like John Cleese mumbling, which

13:10.640 --> 13:11.640
is kind of funny.

13:11.640 --> 13:16.160
I thought they had gotten his talent to voice something, I don't know if it was that, but

13:16.160 --> 13:18.200
maybe a different, no it was Fable 3 I'm thinking of.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.200
Yeah, he was the butler.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.720
I don't know, he very well could be in the Little Big Planet as well, I didn't follow

13:22.720 --> 13:23.720
it that closely.

13:23.720 --> 13:28.240
Sadly, I did not get to play Little Big Planet 2 this week, because I'm trying to save money

13:28.240 --> 13:33.520
right now, so I can't justify a lot of new $60 games, and so for that reason, I don't

13:33.520 --> 13:36.600
have a lot of new games to report on this week sadly, haven't played anything really

13:36.600 --> 13:40.800
brand brand new, except I will mention this, because it's kind of different, and along

13:40.800 --> 13:44.440
with all the like, I guess, doing things you're not supposed to do with your system stuff

13:44.440 --> 13:49.120
that Loki's been talking about, I got an app that got pulled from the app store about like

13:49.120 --> 13:53.120
12 hours after it was up, so I'm kind of happy I got this app.

13:53.120 --> 13:59.000
It's called iDOS, and it's for the phones, and it's basically a DOS emulator for the

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
iPhone.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Awesome.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.600
So, what you can do is that there's various like DOS games that were actually kind of

14:04.600 --> 14:10.040
included in the little store that come with it, like Duke Nukem, the original side scroller

14:10.040 --> 14:16.960
is in it, and Wolfenstein 3D, the shareware episode is available there, and so on.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.200
And let's see, I can actually fire up, I'm gonna fire up Wolfenstein 3D here real quick

14:20.200 --> 14:23.200
on the phone, so you can kind of see this.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.940
The only thing that kind of sucks about it, which actually is a really big drawback, is

14:25.940 --> 14:31.240
that, again, the iPhone makes for a shitty controller, a very shitty controller, especially

14:31.240 --> 14:35.680
when there's like eight different buttons on here to be able to play this, which is

14:35.680 --> 14:37.300
next to impossible.

14:37.300 --> 14:44.200
So you can kind of like, I don't know if you can hear like the old school ad-lib sound

14:44.200 --> 14:49.560
effects there in the mic, but yeah, perhaps, but it's kind of cool.

14:49.560 --> 14:54.760
But just playing it is a pain in the ass, like it just, it doesn't play very well, so.

14:54.760 --> 14:58.760
It's just cool for a minute to say, hehe, DOS games I remember from when I was 12, but

14:58.760 --> 15:02.520
until they get more tangible controls for this thing, it's just gonna be a little ridiculous,

15:02.520 --> 15:03.520
I think.

15:03.520 --> 15:07.400
Plus, I kind of like the fact that I got this app when I wasn't supposed to have it, woohoo!

15:07.400 --> 15:11.080
So that's really the only, like, woohoo!

15:11.080 --> 15:16.520
The only one I wanted to get, actually, that got pulled immediately was Minecrafted, which

15:16.520 --> 15:19.960
was the Minecraft client for- Really?

15:19.960 --> 15:21.160
I didn't even know they had that, okay.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.440
Yeah, it was very brief.

15:22.440 --> 15:26.920
It's supposed to be coming back later, but it was like a leaked version of it.

15:26.920 --> 15:30.880
Funny, though, you mentioned Duke Nukem and stuff like that.

15:30.880 --> 15:35.320
Well, Duke Nukem was on the store, I think, already, and then Wolfenstein is actually

15:35.320 --> 15:41.440
available through, well, through Cydia, if you have a jailbroken device.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.440
Which I don't.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.880
I don't know, I'm like- And yes, it still controls like crap.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.000
I know hella people jailbreak their iPhone and they even came out on the courts and said

15:48.000 --> 15:52.360
that you can or whatever, but I just, I don't know, I'm all paranoid about that stuff, because

15:52.360 --> 15:56.840
this thing is like my life, my texting, my phone, I can't have it go wrong.

15:56.840 --> 16:01.360
Well, but you're already on 4- It's not worth it to relive Wolfenstein 3D

16:01.360 --> 16:02.360
all over again, you know what I mean?

16:02.360 --> 16:03.360
No, it's not.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.440
So that's kind of my perspective on it, so.

16:05.440 --> 16:09.080
Alright, so that was really it for my gaming week, otherwise just more of the same stuff,

16:09.080 --> 16:13.880
you know, WoW, Pac-Man, the new Championship Edition deluxe, and so forth.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.320
So, that's it for my week.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.080
Some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's news.

16:19.080 --> 16:23.840
You can, of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and we're also available

16:23.840 --> 16:29.040
on Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and of course we do tape live at All

16:29.040 --> 16:34.080
Games Radio, allgames.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right

16:34.080 --> 16:39.040
after the Bobby Black Wolf show, if you ever do want to come in and join a live episode.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.840
Please do join us sometime, we'd like to reach you.

16:41.840 --> 16:47.200
Maybe you can sync your PS, or your iPhone with a PS3, they were saying use it as a router

16:47.200 --> 16:48.200
for a controller.

16:48.200 --> 16:53.000
Well, you don't even have to really necessarily do that, some actual homebrew programs through

16:53.000 --> 17:01.000
like Cydia and stuff like that, it allows you to sync a Wii remote to your iPod or iPad

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
to play Nintendo or Super Nintendo games.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.640
It's just not worth it.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.360
It's pretty awesome, though.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.920
Too much, too much work for not enough payoff.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.800
Alright, let's move on to tonight's news, we will start off with, of course, the one

17:13.800 --> 17:15.680
and only Loki tonight.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.760
Yes.

17:16.760 --> 17:23.320
So it's kind of sad, they were trying to find a buyer for bizarre entertainment, or bizarre

17:23.320 --> 17:30.880
creations or whatever, and unfortunately Activision was unable to do so, that's, dude, they put

17:30.880 --> 17:38.760
out some pretty awesome racing games and hell, they had a pretty awesome arcade shooter game.

17:38.760 --> 17:45.040
I can't believe no one wanted to buy the developer of the original Project Gotham games and Geometry

17:45.040 --> 17:46.320
Wars, which was huge.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.320
Microsoft?

17:47.320 --> 17:48.320
Hello?

17:48.320 --> 17:49.320
I'm shocked.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.320
Shocked.

17:50.320 --> 17:55.640
But anyways, but I mean, this is kind of a trend if you think about it, I mean, look

17:55.640 --> 18:01.760
at Harmonix, they're all, oh, nope, no buyers for Harmonix either, I mean, other than themselves.

18:01.760 --> 18:07.680
I don't know, maybe just people aren't snapping up developers anymore, but I mean, I guess

18:07.680 --> 18:15.320
Blur didn't do as well as they had hoped, and, god, I can't remember their stupid running

18:15.320 --> 18:16.880
gun shooter that they had.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.960
Wasn't there a James Bond game that had come out recently?

18:18.960 --> 18:26.160
Oh yeah, yeah, the last James Bond game, but, I mean, come on though, what do you expect,

18:26.160 --> 18:30.740
and this is Activision's fault, I'm sorry, this is plainly their fault, what do you expect

18:30.740 --> 18:36.080
when you release a okay first person shooter the week before Black Ops?

18:36.080 --> 18:38.360
I mean, seriously, you expect it to do well?

18:38.360 --> 18:42.120
No, they expected it to die!

18:42.120 --> 18:46.600
So I don't know, it could have done a lot better if it was released in a different part

18:46.600 --> 18:52.320
of the year or next year or whatever, and it really was, oh, well, we have the license

18:52.320 --> 18:56.760
to the Bond series, ah crap, they're not making another movie, well, we need to make some

18:56.760 --> 19:00.580
money off of this license we paid for, so let's make a game.

19:00.580 --> 19:04.280
And ironically now they are making another Bond movie, didn't they announce that a couple

19:04.280 --> 19:05.280
weeks ago?

19:05.280 --> 19:07.280
And they're just making another game?

19:07.280 --> 19:08.280
Huh.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.280
Interesting.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.280
That's not bizarre.

19:10.280 --> 19:14.360
That's such a bummer, I mean, I had heard somewhere, I don't remember, it was earlier

19:14.360 --> 19:18.080
in the week, so forgive me if my memory is a little rusty, but there's some type of new

19:18.080 --> 19:22.600
tax in, I don't know if it's Britain, the greater part of Britain, or if it's just this

19:22.600 --> 19:26.520
area that the Bizarre Creations studio is in that has something to do with video games

19:26.520 --> 19:29.960
that actually may have had an impact that maybe was too expensive to keep these guys

19:29.960 --> 19:32.440
up and running where they're at now.

19:32.440 --> 19:36.560
It's one of those, you know, it's cheaper to get folks in another country to do the

19:36.560 --> 19:37.680
development or whatever.

19:37.680 --> 19:43.200
Yeah, well they're basically recommending that they close them now, is the recommendation

19:43.200 --> 19:44.200
I guess.

19:44.200 --> 19:48.960
And I guess they recently did the same thing with Budcat in the US.

19:48.960 --> 19:52.460
Well I'm hoping that, you know, it's one of those for every door that closes and other

19:52.460 --> 19:57.000
opens type of scenarios where at least these guys might get, you know, on their feet somewhere

19:57.000 --> 20:01.040
else, or maybe they'll do that thing where they start up their own darn studio, which

20:01.040 --> 20:03.040
we've seen a lot of developers in the past do.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.040
You never know.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.040
Try some different ideas.

20:06.040 --> 20:09.320
I can't believe that means there's never going to be another Geometry Wars game.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.320
Eh, whatever.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.320
Unless, well, I don't know, I really like that series.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.120
I ain't really going to improve upon that, I mean.

20:14.120 --> 20:19.080
Eh, I guess you could look at it that way, but, and I guess technically, what, Activision

20:19.080 --> 20:23.440
would own that, so they could always have one of their other developing houses do it,

20:23.440 --> 20:26.040
but I don't know, it just, it wouldn't be the same.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.040
Yeah.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.440
So, well, that's too bad.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.120
Chat dot orange lounge radio dot com for some comments.

20:33.120 --> 20:37.000
Uh, Ezominar chat room says, this is probably a time where they would rather purchase intellectual

20:37.000 --> 20:41.600
properties to re-release rather than take on new employees.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.400
AlphaKananagram says, WTF, Geometry Wars 2 is the shit.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.600
I agree, Geometry Wars 2 is awesome, and it's kind of a bummer.

20:48.600 --> 20:53.240
But maybe since the Xbox Live Arcade especially, and, and I guess to some extent the PlayStation

20:53.240 --> 20:58.080
Network, is pretty easy to develop for, I mean, I'm, I don't know, I'm not a video game

20:58.080 --> 21:02.520
developer, but I am assuming that what, the, the folks that put out Super Meat Boy, not

21:02.520 --> 21:04.600
exactly a large development studio, correct?

21:04.600 --> 21:08.320
Wasn't it like three or four different people kind of buds getting together doing this game?

21:08.320 --> 21:09.320
Pretty much.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.660
And granted, it's not on PlayStation Network, but it could have been, because I think they

21:12.660 --> 21:15.200
have some dealio with Microsoft.

21:15.200 --> 21:21.120
So my hope, maybe these guys that end up losing their stuff at Bazaar can kind of go and develop

21:21.120 --> 21:28.680
maybe for these smaller platforms, like handhelds and Xbox Live Arcade, the Geometry Wars-esque

21:28.680 --> 21:32.800
sort of games, or whatever other ideas they might have, because, you know, Blur was a

21:32.800 --> 21:34.320
pretty good idea too.

21:34.320 --> 21:40.400
That was a, I, I really think if there had been a Blur 2, it would have been awesome.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.720
Blur 1, it was a good game, but it did need some work.

21:44.720 --> 21:49.120
But I love that idea of the arcade racer meets Mario Kart, and the commercials for that were

21:49.120 --> 21:54.100
always so awesome, where it was, um, the little Mario Kart cute characters that are practically

21:54.100 --> 21:57.720
getting run over by the adult- Better yet, make it an arcade game.

21:57.720 --> 21:58.720
Perhaps.

21:58.720 --> 21:59.720
Perhaps.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.200
Uh, Derek H. in our chat room seems to agree with me.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.920
I hope the people from Bazaar reform a new studio.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.040
I hope so too, or at least a good portion of them.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.360
I hear respawn's hiring.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.360
Never know what might happen.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.880
Alright, moving on to some other news, and this has something to do with kind of like

22:14.880 --> 22:19.920
basement development, if you will, on a very large scale.

22:19.920 --> 22:25.360
StarCraft 2, of course, you know, has some very flexible development materials, we'll

22:25.360 --> 22:26.560
say, in the game.

22:26.560 --> 22:30.140
And people have been able to make all sorts of games within StarCraft 2, hell, there's

22:30.140 --> 22:35.920
an endorsed by Blizzard shooter that's actually in the game, like a shoot-em-up type game

22:35.920 --> 22:36.920
that's there.

22:36.920 --> 22:43.660
Well, somebody has actually gone to such great lengths, they have created World of StarCraft,

22:43.660 --> 22:47.320
and in looking at some of the screenshots in these movies that were subsequently pulled

22:47.320 --> 22:51.240
from YouTube, I'll get to that in a minute, they really had kind of a look and feel, if

22:51.240 --> 22:56.320
you will, of World of Warcraft, but with the StarCraft universe, where you could pick different

22:56.320 --> 23:00.920
classes such as, say, Marine, or what have you, and the different factions in the game,

23:00.920 --> 23:03.560
of course, being the three factions that are with StarCraft.

23:03.560 --> 23:08.200
Well, there were some teasers that were up on the internet, and they got pulled pretty

23:08.200 --> 23:09.200
quickly.

23:09.200 --> 23:12.680
Blizzard put the smackdown on those and took them down.

23:12.680 --> 23:17.600
And a lot of people were saying, boo, Blizzard, you guys are a bunch of bastards for taking

23:17.600 --> 23:20.440
this stuff down, why would you do that?

23:20.440 --> 23:27.440
And the modder who created this, Ryan Wenzel, you know, even kind of went on his own forums

23:27.440 --> 23:31.320
saying, I don't really know what's going on right now, you guys, this is all kind of developing

23:31.320 --> 23:32.320
at a fast pace.

23:32.320 --> 23:33.320
Well, here's the deal.

23:33.320 --> 23:38.560
Activision Blizzard is actually not trying to shut down this mod altogether, but I think

23:38.560 --> 23:42.800
the problem that they're having is that it's the World of StarCraft name that they don't

23:42.800 --> 23:43.800
like.

23:43.800 --> 23:47.880
They don't want this guy making his mod called World of StarCraft.

23:47.880 --> 23:52.560
So it looks like this MMO is actually going to continue on, but under a new name.

23:52.560 --> 23:58.880
By the way, Ryan Wenzel, the modder, has actually been invited by Blizzard to go meet the StarCraft

23:58.880 --> 24:00.560
2 development team.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.560
Interesting.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.860
Also, this whole thing expanded so fast.

24:03.860 --> 24:07.800
He was also invited by the folks that made the MMO League of Legends.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.440
I don't know if you've seen that, but that's like Defense of the Ancients kind of, actually

24:10.440 --> 24:14.480
that is a game I did get to see like 15 seconds of a little bit this weekend.

24:14.480 --> 24:15.800
One of my friends is into that.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.840
And it's like a Defense of the Ancients kind of like game, the old mod.

24:18.840 --> 24:22.000
The people that make that invited this guy to go interview with him.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.600
So his net celebrity went up like exponentially real quick.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.600
That's cool.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.600
Yeah, it's kind of cool.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.400
It was cool that he was invited by Blizzard though, because Blizzard was like, dude, dude,

24:30.400 --> 24:33.440
dude, it's not the mod we're not cool with.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.440
It's the name.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.520
So hopefully they're going to be able to work this out.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.980
And Blizzard wanted to make it clear.

24:37.980 --> 24:43.360
It was never our intention to stop development on the mod, but with the name so closely resembling

24:43.360 --> 24:47.920
that of World of Warcraft, we wanted to discuss the title of the mod with the developer.

24:47.920 --> 24:52.880
And as part of our routine procedure, we contacted YouTube to request the video be removed while

24:52.880 --> 24:55.320
that discussion took place.

24:55.320 --> 24:59.000
Such a little like politically correct way of saying that.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.600
So, interesting, huh?

25:01.600 --> 25:02.600
Yeah.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.480
It's like, we're not trying to be jerks, but no.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.480
It's all branding.

25:07.480 --> 25:12.520
It's also, I think what's going on here, the unsaid part too, is it's a lot of that big

25:12.520 --> 25:17.600
company syndrome where I'm sure the developers actually kind of had their eyebrows raised

25:17.600 --> 25:19.800
going, that's kind of cool what this kid did.

25:19.800 --> 25:24.440
Whereas the legal team and the protections of all this were like, hell no, shut it down.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.120
You don't protect it, you lose it.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.120
Exactly.

25:27.120 --> 25:31.000
So I think, whereas the development team was like, yeah, come on over and play with us

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
for a day.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Let's see what you're up to.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.840
The legal team was like, hell no, you need to shut it down under this name.

25:37.840 --> 25:41.880
So it's kind of interesting how that all works together.

25:41.880 --> 25:44.640
That sounds very corporate to me.

25:44.640 --> 25:47.520
Well, you know what else is stupid?

25:47.520 --> 25:48.520
What is stupid?

25:48.520 --> 25:49.520
Nintendo.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.520
What?

25:50.520 --> 25:51.520
You don't say.

25:51.520 --> 25:57.560
Well, basically, they were talking to Kotaku and said that they didn't see any reason to

25:57.560 --> 26:03.480
put in some sort of trophy or achievement system because they don't want to tell people

26:03.480 --> 26:08.840
how to play the games to get some kind of, quote, mythical reward.

26:08.840 --> 26:15.520
The US exec Bill Trinen is quoted saying, basically, the way the games are designed

26:15.520 --> 26:20.280
is they're designed for you to explore the game yourself and have a sense of discovery.

26:20.280 --> 26:24.560
So it's like, we don't want to give you directions on what to do in the game.

26:24.560 --> 26:27.640
We want you to find everything on your own.

26:27.640 --> 26:28.640
Which I understand that.

26:28.640 --> 26:32.060
And they say that they're not really against the idea of trophies.

26:32.060 --> 26:35.720
They just don't want it to be the whole purpose for playing the game.

26:35.720 --> 26:39.680
They believe that except for Super Smash Bros. Brawl, in which case they don't care about

26:39.680 --> 26:40.680
that.

26:40.680 --> 26:41.680
Well, that's what I said.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.640
They are not against them.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.080
It's just that they don't want that to be the full basis of the game.

26:47.080 --> 26:51.960
I just don't think they want to license the rights to, you know how a lot of these people

26:51.960 --> 26:57.520
copyright different things or have patents for trophy systems and stuff like that?

26:57.520 --> 26:59.520
They probably just don't want to license that crap.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.760
I have no idea and neither do I care.

27:01.760 --> 27:07.680
It's just, they, I kind of think it's interesting that they went on the limb to say this.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.560
Since everybody else is doing it.

27:09.560 --> 27:16.160
Once Xbox started having it, Playstation had it, and they have them in MMOs and all kinds

27:16.160 --> 27:17.160
of stuff.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.160
Way to go Nintendo.

27:18.160 --> 27:22.480
Way to not embrace something that's popular right now.

27:22.480 --> 27:26.200
Online gameplay, meh, whatever, we don't need that.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.160
Trophies, eh, we don't need that.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.800
Organized community, eh, whatever.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.360
I don't know.

27:32.360 --> 27:37.200
Like I get this story and all, but it strikes me a little bit as a reason that's invented

27:37.200 --> 27:38.920
after the fact.

27:38.920 --> 27:43.040
Like that the Wii simply was not programmed to have this type of functionality in it.

27:43.040 --> 27:47.640
And I sort of get that because the Wii doesn't have anything like Xbox Live, like Playstation

27:47.640 --> 27:48.640
Network.

27:48.640 --> 27:52.880
There's no centralized Wii service except for, granted, Wii Connect 24, the thing that

27:52.880 --> 27:56.480
lets you send the mails and all that stuff and the friend code play online.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.480
But I don't know.

27:57.480 --> 28:01.680
It just, I don't know enough about how computers talk to each other and how the internet actually

28:01.680 --> 28:05.360
works, but it doesn't strike me as quite the centralized system that the other two are.

28:05.360 --> 28:08.600
It could be patched in later if they really wanted to.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.960
They did it with the PSP.

28:09.960 --> 28:12.400
Or they're launching a new console.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.000
You know, they could kind of roll it out with that if they wanted to.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
I don't know.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.120
I just feel like there might be a little more value in Virtual Console, especially if they're

28:20.120 --> 28:25.500
gonna try to get us to buy the same games again on the 3DS, to have some type of trophy

28:25.500 --> 28:29.840
room for actually having played these games and getting scores on them.

28:29.840 --> 28:34.840
I mean, even if it's just a frickin' high score table, fuck, I'd take Game Center over

28:34.840 --> 28:35.840
nothing.

28:35.840 --> 28:36.840
You know what I mean?

28:36.840 --> 28:39.900
And Game Center, not that great.

28:39.900 --> 28:40.900
But it's better than nothing.

28:40.900 --> 28:43.640
I also personally don't care about achievements myself.

28:43.640 --> 28:48.000
I just play the games to enjoy them and have fun.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.280
I do, I get that, but it's sort of like, it's kind of nice to have that little pat on the

28:53.280 --> 28:54.280
back.

28:54.280 --> 28:55.280
To have that in your portfolio.

28:55.280 --> 28:59.080
The only reason I've tried to get any achievements in World of Warcraft is for the experience.

28:59.080 --> 29:02.040
Because, you know, I've got experience points for it.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.040
Yeah.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.040
That's it.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.320
You get experience points for doing quests and stuff, but you don't get-

29:06.320 --> 29:08.400
I got them for getting the exploration ones.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.680
Oh yeah, because you get experience points.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.680
Yeah, I get it.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.680
Yeah.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.680
But other than that, I don't care.

29:13.680 --> 29:17.720
It really just, I, you know, I laughed at that one because I thought it was funny, but

29:17.720 --> 29:21.640
other than that, it was like, okay, someone did something that they were gonna be doing

29:21.640 --> 29:22.640
anyway.

29:22.640 --> 29:26.000
But yeah, since you bring that up, Blizzard also doesn't really have a centralized server

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
for achievements.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.480
Like, you can't, you know, this came up on a previous episode of Hoard House, you can't

29:30.480 --> 29:35.200
link your Starcraft and your Warcraft achievements together right now.

29:35.200 --> 29:39.200
Maybe when Diablo comes out, there'll be like some type of Blizzard centralized thing.

29:39.200 --> 29:42.320
But then again, that'll only ever be for Blizzard games.

29:42.320 --> 29:46.120
It's never gonna connect to the Steam and all the Steam achievements.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.920
I do, I get that it's starting to get a little fragmented.

29:48.920 --> 29:53.120
It is a little silly that, you know, you have your set on the Wii and your set on the 360

29:53.120 --> 29:57.240
and the Playstation 3, and it really should just be about beating the game start to finish.

29:57.240 --> 30:01.040
But I don't know, I sorta like having that little, that little sticker in my book that

30:01.040 --> 30:03.800
says, you did something really weird in this game, you know?

30:03.800 --> 30:06.320
Rob, I know how we can fix that problem.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.320
How?

30:07.320 --> 30:13.320
We just take a page out of Activision's book, we send out patches.

30:13.320 --> 30:16.000
Fuck yes!

30:16.000 --> 30:20.120
Just like they did back in the Atari 2600 day, that would be amazing, like, that you

30:20.120 --> 30:24.880
should get the actual patches for, and if you, you know, didn't read about this way

30:24.880 --> 30:29.580
back in the day, back in the 80s when the Atari 2600 was big, you could take a picture

30:29.580 --> 30:33.360
of your screen if you get a high score on a game, send it into Activision, and if it

30:33.360 --> 30:36.760
was above a certain threshold that would be in the instruction manual, they would send

30:36.760 --> 30:41.760
you a patch that you could like put on your leather jacket and, you know, hey, I'm cool.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.360
And I'm pretty sure that's where the whole idea of achievements on a 360 came from in

30:45.360 --> 30:46.720
the first place.

30:46.720 --> 30:51.040
It's really a bummer, actually, that when they did Game Room, uh, you didn't have any

30:51.040 --> 30:53.480
type of resurgence of this, you know what I mean?

30:53.480 --> 30:56.840
I mean, I guess there were the little trophies in Game Room, but it wasn't quite the same,

30:56.840 --> 30:57.840
you know?

30:57.840 --> 31:02.880
Because patches are expensive, and if a publisher doesn't have to make unnecessary expenses

31:02.880 --> 31:04.520
like that, they won't.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.920
But if you print them in mass, it's not that bad.

31:06.920 --> 31:07.920
It would be awesome, though.

31:07.920 --> 31:14.420
I mean, come on, I've seen some of the tchotchke crap that they just push out for certain game

31:14.420 --> 31:19.240
titles that are terrible, but, um, I don't know.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.240
They could do it.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.840
They're just being lazy.

31:21.840 --> 31:26.240
Spagenator in our chatroom says, I wonder if they'll ever be a Diablo MMO.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.960
It's kind of World of Warcraft, actually.

31:27.960 --> 31:32.960
When I first played World of Warcraft, I was feeling a lot more Diablo than I was Warcraft,

31:32.960 --> 31:39.360
because Warcraft is an RTS, and World of Warcraft really isn't, so it's interesting.

31:39.360 --> 31:43.920
Derek H. says he had a patch for Barnstorming, and DefectiveCandy says my grandfather had

31:43.920 --> 31:44.920
one of those patches.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.680
So, some people remember those patches.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.500
Well, see, that's the thing.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.680
That's how awesome it was.

31:49.680 --> 31:51.560
People are still talking about them today.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.840
See, if they did that now, that would be awesome.

31:54.840 --> 31:58.000
People would be talking about them for a long time.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
But no.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Missed opportunity.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.720
It's all about cash now.

32:01.720 --> 32:02.720
Unfortunate.

32:02.720 --> 32:06.240
Alright, well, what else is in the news, Loki?

32:06.240 --> 32:07.240
Big stuff.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.240
The 3DS.

32:08.240 --> 32:12.560
They finally had the announcement of the release date for the 3DS and the price.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.080
We knew it was going to be in March.

32:15.080 --> 32:19.080
Now it's been pinpointed to March 27th.

32:19.080 --> 32:25.540
The price is going to be $2.50 in the US, or I guess North America, and they're saying

32:25.540 --> 32:31.400
that they're going to have quite a few launch games available for that and whatnot.

32:31.400 --> 32:35.480
Not really certain on which games are going to make the launch, although two that have

32:35.480 --> 32:40.600
been nailed down in the launch period by Nintendo, coming from Nintendo.

32:40.600 --> 32:48.360
Unfortunately, are Pilotwings and Nintendogs plus cats.

32:48.360 --> 32:52.120
I liked Pilotwings back on the Super Nintendo.

32:52.120 --> 32:58.080
The Pilotwings game looked neat, Nintendogs and cats...

32:58.080 --> 32:59.960
I know the game's going to suck.

32:59.960 --> 33:05.600
I know, it's one of those things where it's like, it would be awesome to try, but I don't

33:05.600 --> 33:06.600
want it.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.960
Because I know I will get bored with it so quick.

33:09.960 --> 33:11.040
It's just...

33:11.040 --> 33:13.640
I know exactly what you mean, it's just like the original Nintendogs.

33:13.640 --> 33:16.520
You read about it on paper and all the features they're putting in, you're like, oh man, this

33:16.520 --> 33:18.400
sounds like it's going to be really cool.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.480
And then I just know it, just like the first Nintendogs.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.760
I buy the game and it's going to be dumb after 30 minutes.

33:23.760 --> 33:24.760
You know what I mean?

33:24.760 --> 33:30.240
You're like, God, I have to feed it every day, I have to play with it every day.

33:30.240 --> 33:35.040
Nintendogs is kind of, at least the original one, is kind of an overblown Facebook game.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.560
The original Nintendogs has a lot in common with a Facebook game.

33:37.560 --> 33:41.600
I don't know, I can't explain it, but it's what it feels like to me.

33:41.600 --> 33:42.600
Yeah.

33:42.600 --> 33:46.960
Some of the interesting things that they were talking about, which is kind of weird, is

33:46.960 --> 33:56.080
the system actually has a pedometer built into it, and you get coins by walking around.

33:56.080 --> 34:02.320
So you earn coins that you can spend in games for different things.

34:02.320 --> 34:08.840
And then they have an activity log, which attracts your gameplay as well as your steps.

34:08.840 --> 34:12.880
They're also talking about how you can make Mii's in the interface, and they have that

34:12.880 --> 34:16.120
cool feature where you can take a picture of yourself and give you a bunch of different

34:16.120 --> 34:17.560
options for Mii's and stuff.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.780
You can import your Mii's from the Wii.

34:19.780 --> 34:20.920
But you can't go the other way.

34:20.920 --> 34:28.920
Yeah, just because it's, well, because they say it's more complex for, you know, than

34:28.920 --> 34:29.920
the Wii system.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.560
The one on the 3DS is Mii 2.0.

34:32.560 --> 34:38.120
Yeah, and it makes sense because if you think about it though, it all comes down to the

34:38.120 --> 34:43.280
fact that they can't patch games, because they have all the Mii's and stuff in the backgrounds

34:43.280 --> 34:50.160
on the games, but they can't display the ones that they don't have the features for, even

34:50.160 --> 34:59.340
if they did an update for the editor or whatever on the Wii to make it more interactive and

34:59.340 --> 35:04.800
stuff and add more features, but it would still not be compatible with those games,

35:04.800 --> 35:05.800
I think.

35:05.800 --> 35:09.800
What do you guys think about that price point, $250 for a 3DS?

35:09.800 --> 35:10.800
Do you think that's fair?

35:10.800 --> 35:12.320
Do you think it's too much?

35:12.320 --> 35:15.840
Because there's some people on the internet that say, you know what, that's too much.

35:15.840 --> 35:16.960
I think it's fine.

35:16.960 --> 35:20.920
I think it makes sense, because they're not going to really have any competition right

35:20.920 --> 35:21.920
now.

35:21.920 --> 35:25.540
And I guarantee that thing will be selling for a lot more than that.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.640
You're not going to be able to find these things.

35:27.640 --> 35:33.760
So you get your orders in while you can, and if you're savvy enough, buy two and sell one

35:33.760 --> 35:37.380
on eBay.

35:37.380 --> 35:38.380
I kind of agree.

35:38.380 --> 35:41.600
I think the price point is actually better than what I was expecting.

35:41.600 --> 35:46.160
I thought it was going to be 3DS, $300 was what I was originally thinking they were going

35:46.160 --> 35:49.280
to do with it, but no, this is actually lower than I thought.

35:49.280 --> 35:53.640
It's right at what I expected, based on what they put out the end retail price.

35:53.640 --> 35:54.640
That makes sense.

35:54.640 --> 35:59.480
And it kind of leaves them a little room to lower it later.

35:59.480 --> 36:03.520
Like if they want to do a cut for Christmas, they probably will.

36:03.520 --> 36:06.880
You know, they could cut it to $200 by Christmas with some type of package.

36:06.880 --> 36:07.880
I don't think they will.

36:07.880 --> 36:08.920
I don't think they need to.

36:08.920 --> 36:13.640
I think it's going to be like the Wii, where it was in short supply for a very long time,

36:13.640 --> 36:16.520
and they're not going to cut that thing for at least a year.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.120
At least a year.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.120
It prints money.

36:20.120 --> 36:23.520
The price scale will come, and probably a new system revision will come out.

36:23.520 --> 36:28.280
I guarantee you that that thing will not be dropping in price by the end of this year.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.980
Every kid will want one too.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.360
Every freaking kid.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.240
It's 3D without glasses.

36:33.240 --> 36:34.960
I mean, come on.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.280
People are like, oh, it's so stupid, you know.

36:38.280 --> 36:42.400
People are just going to be blown away by just seeing the actual screens.

36:42.400 --> 36:48.180
They're just going to be blown away.

36:48.180 --> 36:52.400
I don't even want to quote certain analysts, but there's people out there that have said

36:52.400 --> 36:56.560
they could have charged more than that, and they could have still sold all the units that

36:56.560 --> 36:57.560
they had.

36:57.560 --> 37:01.040
So, I don't know.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.520
I'm looking at some of the comments in our chat room.

37:03.520 --> 37:07.400
Game Guru says, $250 is a bit too expensive for a handheld game system.

37:07.400 --> 37:11.160
Tiger Claw says, when you put the 3DS with the PSP Go, from the price standing point,

37:11.160 --> 37:13.060
the 3DS has the most features.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.060
How much was the PSP Go?

37:14.060 --> 37:15.520
Was the PSP Go $250 as well?

37:15.520 --> 37:21.300
Yeah, but see, okay, there's a difference with the PSP Go and the 3DS, okay?

37:21.300 --> 37:30.080
If the 3DS didn't have it, it'd be like the 3D, the DSi, and not even so the DSi, I guess.

37:30.080 --> 37:35.000
The PSP Go had less features than the PSP, and they came out at a price point that was

37:35.000 --> 37:40.880
more expensive than the current model, and you couldn't buy games for it in stores.

37:40.880 --> 37:44.960
So it had people scratching their heads like, why do you want me to get this?

37:44.960 --> 37:51.760
There's no enhancements to it other than onboard storage, which memory is so cheap nowadays

37:51.760 --> 37:54.000
it doesn't matter.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.800
There's no UMD drive, so I can't play any of the games I normally have right now.

37:58.800 --> 38:01.200
There's no way for me to convert them into a digital format.

38:01.200 --> 38:08.400
I have to rebuy my games if I want to buy the system.

38:08.400 --> 38:12.900
There's some Bluetooth support, great.

38:12.900 --> 38:20.520
But the thing is, and this is the best part, their retail partners or whatever, like GameStops

38:20.520 --> 38:24.640
and stuff like that, or just mom and pop shops, they weren't bringing them in.

38:24.640 --> 38:30.480
Well, GameStop might have, because they have better partnerships with these guys, but individual

38:30.480 --> 38:33.360
mom and pop shops were not bringing them in, because what money are they going to make

38:33.360 --> 38:34.360
off of it?

38:34.360 --> 38:37.640
The system, they're making no money off of it, and they can't sell any software for it,

38:37.640 --> 38:41.520
so they said, fuck them, we're not bringing this shit in.

38:41.520 --> 38:45.000
And people are just like, if you want a PSP, get a PSP 3000.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.320
I still say that today.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.320
Get a PSP 3000 if you're looking at a PSP.

38:48.320 --> 38:49.880
Don't you think you can get a Go anymore?

38:49.880 --> 38:52.880
They slowly phase out.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.800
So has the PSP went?

38:55.800 --> 38:58.840
Let me get to a couple more 3DS stories here, and we'll kind of continue this discussion,

38:58.840 --> 39:02.900
because there are some other interesting developments in the 3DS world.

39:02.900 --> 39:04.400
Some of it has to do with online play.

39:04.400 --> 39:08.440
First off, did you hear that the friend codes are getting reduced to one friend code?

39:08.440 --> 39:12.640
So sadly friend codes aren't going away, but it's one friend code for everything.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.640
So you won't have a separate friend code.

39:14.640 --> 39:18.080
Well I still don't like the idea of a friend code, but I understand that they want that

39:18.080 --> 39:22.320
in there so that the rapists can't rape our children through the internet or something

39:22.320 --> 39:23.320
like that.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.640
Hide your kids, hide your wife.

39:25.640 --> 39:32.880
I don't, I still don't get why you can't just have a name instead of a 16 digit randomized

39:32.880 --> 39:33.880
code.

39:33.880 --> 39:37.520
I mean it's a step in the right direction, but when Nintendo is already three steps behind

39:37.520 --> 39:44.280
you when it comes to online play, that news kind of just makes me go, whatever, it's a

39:44.280 --> 39:47.840
good thing you figured the 3D thing out, because I don't know otherwise.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.520
But that is, I guess whatever.

39:49.520 --> 39:53.560
At least you only have the one friend code, despite the fact that it'll not really be

39:53.560 --> 39:54.560
something customizable.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.880
It is supposed to show you what your friends are playing though.

39:56.880 --> 39:57.880
That sounds like a little better.

39:57.880 --> 40:02.200
Yeah, and there's apparently an app in it that will show you what the status is of your

40:02.200 --> 40:04.120
friends at any time.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.780
So you can see what they're playing or what have you.

40:05.780 --> 40:11.200
So a little more like you're familiar with Xbox Live, even though it's in an app, interesting.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.080
Here's the other thing though that is kind of cool, and to be fair, I should say this

40:14.080 --> 40:15.520
when it comes to friend codes.

40:15.520 --> 40:20.380
If you are connected to another friend local, on the local wireless, you can push a button

40:20.380 --> 40:24.040
to accept or send a friend request and you won't ever have to exchange the number.

40:24.040 --> 40:30.120
The 3DS will just automatically grab the information and there you have it, your friends.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.520
So that's, okay, now that's a little better.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.720
I like that part of it.

40:34.720 --> 40:41.840
So if you will, and you're at a convention, you can push a button and then get gang raped

40:41.840 --> 40:42.840
by friend requests.

40:42.840 --> 40:51.300
Yeah, but it has to be a mutual button pressing, meaning you both have to accept the request.

40:51.300 --> 40:52.300
You know what I mean?

40:52.300 --> 40:55.640
It's a big old friend request gang bang.

40:55.640 --> 40:59.560
I know, the next Penny Arcade Expo or E3, man.

40:59.560 --> 41:03.080
You know, the 3DS will be out by this year's E3, so it's going to be kind of interesting

41:03.080 --> 41:04.080
to see how.

41:04.080 --> 41:09.000
E3 is not so much a fan event as it is a trade slash journalism event, but still, there's

41:09.000 --> 41:12.460
going to be, you know how many fanboys still manage to go to E3 because there are blogs

41:12.460 --> 41:13.460
and so forth.

41:13.460 --> 41:19.360
You know, there'll be plenty of that exchanging and stuff going on.

41:19.360 --> 41:22.160
I wonder if they're going to have like a booth like they did back when the DS was new where

41:22.160 --> 41:23.960
you could kind of do the download of the demos.

41:23.960 --> 41:26.160
So I think that's a good idea.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.160
That used to be cool.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.760
That's how I played Meteos for the first time, which is still one of my favorite DS games

41:29.760 --> 41:30.760
to this day.

41:30.760 --> 41:32.760
Well, you know what my game was at that time?

41:32.760 --> 41:33.760
Electroplankton.

41:33.760 --> 41:34.760
Oh, yes.

41:34.760 --> 41:35.760
I remember that.

41:35.760 --> 41:36.760
Yeah.

41:36.760 --> 41:37.760
I still remember one of the first E3s I went to.

41:37.760 --> 41:38.760
No, it was probably the second one.

41:38.760 --> 41:42.640
I remember when Shane took the Meteos demo with us, you know, because he just left his

41:42.640 --> 41:43.640
standby.

41:43.640 --> 41:44.640
Oh, that's all right.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.640
Yeah.

41:45.640 --> 41:46.640
We all did that one night.

41:46.640 --> 41:50.840
We downloaded the Meteos from the 3D, not 3DS, from the DS station that they had on

41:50.840 --> 41:53.960
the floor, and then we just didn't close, or we didn't turn off the DS.

41:53.960 --> 41:57.040
We would just close the lid, and the battery had been fully charged that morning, so we

41:57.040 --> 42:00.200
closed the lid, took it with us, and then at dinner that night, it was like, let's play

42:00.200 --> 42:01.200
more Meteos.

42:01.200 --> 42:04.480
You know, we still had the demo from the show that morning, so.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.620
And I think, yeah, I don't know if it was Shane or somebody.

42:06.620 --> 42:11.640
Some people didn't, like, they left their DS on and plugged in, like, after E3 was over

42:11.640 --> 42:14.880
so they wouldn't lose the demo, and so they had, some people, I think, had it for, like,

42:14.880 --> 42:18.160
up to a week after the show was over, just to still play it more.

42:18.160 --> 42:20.360
It was a great puzzle game.

42:20.360 --> 42:25.640
Anyhow, another quick story about the 3DS, and this has to do with the Virtual Console.

42:25.640 --> 42:30.400
They did confirm, I mean, we kind of already knew this, but just a confirmation, Game Boy

42:30.400 --> 42:34.560
and Game Boy Color games will be coming to the Virtual Console.

42:34.560 --> 42:40.000
Super Mario Land is the first confirmed, which, by the way, blows, compared to other Mario

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
games.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.400
It's like, it doesn't even play like other Mario games.

42:42.400 --> 42:47.440
You don't have a fireball, you have this random ball that bounces off walls, and it's like

42:47.440 --> 42:48.680
this Egyptian theme.

42:48.680 --> 42:51.400
I don't think it was supposed to be Mario game at first, I think it was supposed to

42:51.400 --> 42:52.400
be something else.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.400
But whatever.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.400
It's like Mr. Do.

42:54.400 --> 42:59.840
No, well, okay, yeah, the weapon is, I mean, the gameplay is still like a Mario game, but

42:59.840 --> 43:00.840
yeah.

43:00.840 --> 43:03.680
So yeah, Super Mario Land is confirmed.

43:03.680 --> 43:08.200
No word about advanced games, because keep in mind there's no longer an advanced slot

43:08.200 --> 43:14.640
on these things, so no word yet if that's coming in the future or what.

43:14.640 --> 43:15.640
So there you go.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.800
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

43:18.800 --> 43:20.520
Maybe something not about the 3DS?

43:20.520 --> 43:22.800
Uh, actually, no.

43:22.800 --> 43:28.520
This actually has to do with, well, it has something to do with Nintendo, but not specifically

43:28.520 --> 43:31.240
Nintendo's side.

43:31.240 --> 43:36.680
Yoshinori Ono, who is the producer of Street Fighter IV, said he wants to make Nintendo

43:36.680 --> 43:39.400
vs. Capcom.

43:39.400 --> 43:50.320
And he's quoted as saying that he wants to pitch it to Masahiro Sakurai, who is the creator

43:50.320 --> 43:52.280
of Super Smash Bros.

43:52.280 --> 43:54.600
So I think that that would actually be kind of cool, I mean, they're already doing Marvel

43:54.600 --> 44:00.800
vs. Capcom 3, and then we have Tekken in Street Fighter, so who knows?

44:00.800 --> 44:06.160
Would you like to have Jigglypuff farting on Blanca or something?

44:06.160 --> 44:07.160
That would be really odd.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.160
That would be odd.

44:08.160 --> 44:09.160
I don't think they would ever do it.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.160
No.

44:10.160 --> 44:13.680
It would kind of be a dopey game, but in a, I don't know, like I said, there's a lot of

44:13.680 --> 44:18.200
dopey games out there, I don't know, I don't necessarily mean that in a bad way.

44:18.200 --> 44:23.120
If something's gonna work with Nintendo, it's gonna have to be like a, I think Namco would

44:23.120 --> 44:30.440
do it, because all the Tekken games had weird characters like Gon and Yoda.

44:30.440 --> 44:33.960
Why don't you just have Mega Man be a character in the next Smash Bros.?

44:33.960 --> 44:36.960
I mean, weren't they kind of saying that a while ago anyway?

44:36.960 --> 44:41.200
I remember when this last one that came out on the Wii was being teased with all the new

44:41.200 --> 44:45.240
characters, because Snake was in it and Sonic was in it, there was rumors for the longest

44:45.240 --> 44:49.840
time that Mega Man was also gonna be in it, because I guess there was another third-party

44:49.840 --> 44:55.320
character that was in the game or whatever, which ended up being Sonic, I think, and they,

44:55.320 --> 44:58.640
you know, people were saying, oh, it's Mega Man, it's gonna be Mega Man, because Capcom

44:58.640 --> 45:00.880
and Nintendo have been talking about this for forever.

45:00.880 --> 45:03.080
I think that'll be the most that you see come of this.

45:03.080 --> 45:08.920
I just think in a full Marvel versus Capcom, or even Tatsunoko versus Capcom kind of way.

45:08.920 --> 45:11.760
Unless they do all the cutesy characters.

45:11.760 --> 45:14.160
Maybe all the cutesy Capcom characters could do it.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.160
Cutesy Capcom battle!

45:15.160 --> 45:19.720
Tatsunoko versus Capcom would be awesome with a Mario character or something like that,

45:19.720 --> 45:24.440
or I could see them doing maybe, like, Link or something in the Mar- like, they ported

45:24.440 --> 45:28.160
Marvel versus Capcom 3 or something to the Wii or something, they could add Link in there

45:28.160 --> 45:29.720
and just, like, Soul Calibur.

45:29.720 --> 45:32.400
Yeah, that, that maybe, maybe, maybe.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.640
Super chibi 3D Capcom fighter!

45:34.640 --> 45:35.640
Eeee!

45:35.640 --> 45:37.680
Well, that'll be the game that comes with it, and it's all the cute-

45:37.680 --> 45:39.320
You know, Capcom did Pacato Fighter!

45:39.320 --> 45:40.320
Uh-huh.

45:40.320 --> 45:41.840
Yep, so it's been done.

45:41.840 --> 45:45.000
It could- anything's possible, I suppose.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
So.

45:46.000 --> 45:51.120
Ed Seton Beaver in our chatroom says, I mean, Capcom characters would fuck up the stupid

45:51.120 --> 45:53.000
Nintendo characters.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
I don't know, though.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.640
Couldn't Kirby just go- and, you know, just kind of have his way with the Capcom characters?

45:58.640 --> 45:59.640
He does suck.

45:59.640 --> 46:08.320
Alright, I don't know, let the fanboy wank begin after that story, but I don't think

46:08.320 --> 46:12.720
anything will come of it except maybe in the next Super Smash Bros. game, which will probably

46:12.720 --> 46:13.720
be on the 3DS.

46:13.720 --> 46:14.720
Just saying.

46:14.720 --> 46:17.480
Yeah, and never want to get a big ol' hard-on about it.

46:17.480 --> 46:18.480
Mm-hmm.

46:18.480 --> 46:23.280
Because, oh my god, you can play it on the Wii, friend code, across galaxies, and locally,

46:23.280 --> 46:25.200
and oh my god.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.240
And Miis.

46:26.240 --> 46:27.240
Watch that.

46:27.240 --> 46:32.440
There's gonna be a Super Smash Bros. fighter thingy on the stinkin' DS, and your Mii will

46:32.440 --> 46:33.440
be a character.

46:33.440 --> 46:34.440
That wasn't in the Wii version?

46:34.440 --> 46:36.440
Eh, it might have been, I don't know.

46:36.440 --> 46:37.440
It's been-

46:37.440 --> 46:38.440
Maybe not, I don't know.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.240
It's been years since I've played it at this point.

46:40.240 --> 46:41.560
I don't remember.

46:41.560 --> 46:45.440
I liked, like, even like the little adventure part of that game.

46:45.440 --> 46:47.360
The adventure stuff was cool, I'll give you that.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.160
That was a really cool part of the game.

46:49.160 --> 46:50.160
So.

46:50.160 --> 46:51.960
Alright, let's move on with some release dates.

46:51.960 --> 46:55.120
Travel the world and see what's coming out to a console near you.

46:55.120 --> 46:58.760
It's not a lot of stuff coming out this week, but there is a couple good things.

46:58.760 --> 47:03.840
Dead Space 2 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, as well as the collector's

47:03.840 --> 47:09.360
editions with the wonderful replica gun in there.

47:09.360 --> 47:14.680
Paws and Claws Marine Rescue on Nintendo DS.

47:14.680 --> 47:24.100
Two Worlds 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, as well as the royal edition of that.

47:24.100 --> 47:28.320
And Lord of Arcana on PSP.

47:28.320 --> 47:29.320
That I believe is it.

47:29.320 --> 47:30.320
Alright.

47:30.320 --> 47:32.320
I have to take a look here.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.320
Yep, that is it.

47:33.320 --> 47:35.480
Can we do things a little out of order and go to UK dates?

47:35.480 --> 47:36.480
Oh no, nevermind.

47:36.480 --> 47:37.480
I, I've, okay.

47:37.480 --> 47:41.800
Sorry, my, well my, my thing wasn't loading, but it just popped up, so.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.200
I blame your thing.

47:43.200 --> 47:44.200
Yes.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.200
Stupid thing.

47:45.200 --> 47:47.800
Alright, well here we go, Japanese release dates.

47:47.800 --> 47:53.280
The Xbox 360 will be getting Monster Hunter Frontier Online Season 10.0 Premium Package.

47:53.280 --> 47:57.800
From what I understand, this game is pretty big over there, so it's like, I guess a repackaging

47:57.800 --> 48:00.120
a new, new expansion or what have you.

48:00.120 --> 48:01.800
Will be coming out on the 26th.

48:01.800 --> 48:06.400
Otherwise, some other games that are coming out on the 360 very soon, Dream Club Zero

48:06.400 --> 48:10.800
and Galgun are both coming out very soon on the 360 over in Japan.

48:10.800 --> 48:16.200
But I hear Galgun actually has a demo for it out there if you do have a Japanese Xbox

48:16.200 --> 48:22.720
360 account, which I do, though, huh, I did.

48:22.720 --> 48:24.640
I don't, I'd have recovered that account.

48:24.640 --> 48:26.240
Well good luck with that.

48:26.240 --> 48:31.160
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Dragon Age Origins gets its Japanese release.

48:31.160 --> 48:34.360
I mean, I know that's a long time after we had it, but they've probably localized quite

48:34.360 --> 48:35.500
a bit for Japan.

48:35.500 --> 48:36.600
So it took a little while.

48:36.600 --> 48:41.360
Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Mindjack comes out, Shooting Studio and Wizardry Twin

48:41.360 --> 48:42.360
Pack.

48:42.360 --> 48:46.120
Like, is that like the old school C64 wizardry games?

48:46.120 --> 48:48.200
Like a new version of it?

48:48.200 --> 48:49.920
They're RPG games.

48:49.920 --> 48:54.800
Dude, I think these might be like new versions of that old school game from the 80s.

48:54.800 --> 48:58.880
Very, very text heavy in Japanese, though, so you better be fluent in Japanese if you're

48:58.880 --> 48:59.880
gonna import that.

48:59.880 --> 49:04.080
Did you see that Zork is on good old games now?

49:04.080 --> 49:10.880
I had heard about that, but you know, I can't justify paying what they want for Zork.

49:10.880 --> 49:11.880
You know what I mean?

49:11.880 --> 49:13.360
Plus, I had the whole research.

49:13.360 --> 49:17.700
You could play Zork on GameTap, like back when GameTap was cool, when Turner owned it.

49:17.700 --> 49:22.520
You could play the Zork games, and you know, I kind of got my fill of retro back then.

49:22.520 --> 49:24.620
And now I'm over it.

49:24.620 --> 49:30.640
On the Nintendo Wii, huge week on the Wii, huge, gigantic, monumental week on the Wii.

49:30.640 --> 49:32.580
The last story comes out this week.

49:32.580 --> 49:34.000
That is a huge game.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.640
I would be so excited if this game would come out in the US, they have said nothing about

49:37.640 --> 49:38.640
it yet.

49:38.640 --> 49:40.440
They have said they are not bringing it out.

49:40.440 --> 49:41.440
Fuckers!

49:41.440 --> 49:42.440
When did they say that?

49:42.440 --> 49:46.740
They said that it was Europe, Nintendo Europe was commenting on it.

49:46.740 --> 49:48.560
They said they are not bringing it out.

49:48.560 --> 49:50.840
Change your fucking mind, because that game needs to come out.

49:50.840 --> 49:56.080
I guess the wording is, they have no plans to bring it out yet.

49:56.080 --> 49:59.760
Well, you need to change them plans or stop being so coy about whatever you have planned

49:59.760 --> 50:00.760
for E3.

50:00.760 --> 50:04.840
You know, what are they going to talk about on the Wii at E3 this year?

50:04.840 --> 50:06.680
There's nothing to talk about.

50:06.680 --> 50:10.160
At least this would be something to hold people over, because again, if you don't know what

50:10.160 --> 50:14.440
this game is and why I'm so excited about it, it's a Mistwalker RPG on the Wii.

50:14.440 --> 50:20.120
And the graphics actually look pretty phenomenal, you know, compared to the 360 and PS3, considering

50:20.120 --> 50:21.120
the Wii's limitations.

50:21.120 --> 50:26.220
Mistwalker, of course, the studio that made Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey.

50:26.220 --> 50:30.300
And especially with Lost Odyssey, underrated RPG games available on the 360.

50:30.300 --> 50:33.560
This is kind of like their foray into the Wii universe.

50:33.560 --> 50:34.960
And it's coming out in Japan this week.

50:34.960 --> 50:39.340
There's also a Wii bundle that's going to have this, but nothing about when it's coming

50:39.340 --> 50:44.920
out over here, if ever, besides that Koi Lo comment that Loki already referenced.

50:44.920 --> 50:49.340
Just to, like, kind of put this in perspective, when you look at, like, Japanese releases

50:49.340 --> 50:53.060
for February, there are four games.

50:53.060 --> 50:55.400
Actually three, because one of them is a collector's pack.

50:55.400 --> 50:56.720
Three games coming out in February.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.640
Here it is, right here.

50:58.640 --> 50:59.640
Nintendo of France.

50:59.640 --> 51:03.680
It says they have no plans to localize Last Story.

51:03.680 --> 51:08.840
It says, let's see here, no plans at the moment.

51:08.840 --> 51:10.760
Don't listen to the guy from France.

51:10.760 --> 51:17.720
It says the adaptation of this game could be very long, 12,000 dialogue, or it says

51:17.720 --> 51:20.040
it has 12,000 dialogues.

51:20.040 --> 51:22.520
Listen up, Nintendo of France.

51:22.520 --> 51:26.880
You need to surrender to the idea of having Last Story in English, not French.

51:26.880 --> 51:30.120
And their translation teams are overstretched in the short term.

51:30.120 --> 51:36.600
I'll tell you what's gonna happen, hackers will do this.

51:36.600 --> 51:37.600
Hackers will...

51:37.600 --> 51:38.600
Hackers gonna hack.

51:38.600 --> 51:41.520
Hackers are gonna translate this.

51:41.520 --> 51:47.400
And you know, it will happen, it'll get released, and that'll piss people off.

51:47.400 --> 51:50.280
I think, I don't know, I don't trust some guy.

51:50.280 --> 51:55.160
If Reggie Fils-Aime had come out and said, it's not happening, then I'd believe it.

51:55.160 --> 52:00.040
Some random, you know, executive with Nintendo of France says it, we're all supposed to accept

52:00.040 --> 52:01.040
that as the final word.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.040
I don't think so.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.360
I say no.

52:03.360 --> 52:09.600
And then they followed it up with, I fought in your general direction.

52:09.600 --> 52:11.520
Stop.

52:11.520 --> 52:14.360
Moving on to the DS.

52:14.360 --> 52:17.360
Actually not a lot going on on the DS either, but this is a little more understandable

52:17.360 --> 52:19.980
of course, because we have 3DS on the horizon in February.

52:19.980 --> 52:25.900
But there are a couple puzzle games, and then a game called Sora no Otoshimono Forte Dreamy

52:25.900 --> 52:29.320
Season in regular and deluxe editions.

52:29.320 --> 52:34.420
It's an adventure game that's coming out with 3 chibi little cartoony babes on the cover.

52:34.420 --> 52:37.380
It looks like it might be some type of card game, but I do want to point out that this

52:37.380 --> 52:40.060
chick is not wearing pants in the screenshot.

52:40.060 --> 52:41.600
She's wearing gym uniform.

52:41.600 --> 52:46.380
Whatever, it looks like she's not wearing pants to me.

52:46.380 --> 52:48.280
She's not wearing pants, she's wearing shorts.

52:48.280 --> 52:49.280
Fine.

52:49.280 --> 52:50.280
They're bloomers.

52:50.280 --> 52:51.280
They're very short shorts.

52:51.280 --> 52:52.280
They're bloomers.

52:52.280 --> 52:53.800
Well, they have to be agile.

52:53.800 --> 53:02.960
Lastly, on the PS3, I'm sorry, PSP, Toaru Majutsu no Kinsho Mokuroku comes out from

53:02.960 --> 53:08.960
ASCII this week, which that game, it's a futuristic world with magic powers.

53:08.960 --> 53:09.960
It's a fighting game.

53:09.960 --> 53:13.000
It's kind of like Dissada, but just with general characters.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.880
But this game might catch some people's attention.

53:14.880 --> 53:17.840
Valkyria Chronicles 3, Unrecorded Chronicles.

53:17.840 --> 53:22.080
That comes out with PSP this week, so I'm sure that'll have its fans and importers.

53:22.080 --> 53:24.800
Okay, now we can go to the UK Dark Sakura.

53:24.800 --> 53:25.800
Sorry.

53:25.800 --> 53:26.800
Okay.

53:26.800 --> 53:30.640
On the 25th, we have Dead Space, for the iPhone, sorry.

53:30.640 --> 53:36.800
On the 28th, though, we have Dead Space 2 for PS3, PC, Xbox 360, and Mario Sports Mix

53:36.800 --> 53:41.600
and Yogi Bear, the video game.

53:41.600 --> 53:46.160
Have you seen the alternate ending, quote unquote, on YouTube where Boo Boo shoots Yogi

53:46.160 --> 53:47.160
Bear?

53:47.160 --> 53:51.880
It's the alternate ending to the movie.

53:51.880 --> 53:52.880
It's great.

53:52.880 --> 53:57.360
That would mean you'd have to go see the movie, right?

53:57.360 --> 53:58.840
And I would hate to see that movie.

53:58.840 --> 54:01.960
No, you don't, you just look it up on YouTube.

54:01.960 --> 54:07.440
I understand that, but I don't want to even try to pretend to see that movie or part of

54:07.440 --> 54:08.520
the movie.

54:08.520 --> 54:09.680
You don't understand, it's awesome.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.640
Wait, hold on, here it is, here it is.

54:11.640 --> 54:15.680
Here it is.

54:15.680 --> 54:21.120
And it's all of the sad music and everything, and Yogi Bear sees the little wanted ad for

54:21.120 --> 54:28.720
himself or whatever up on the wall, and there's Boo Boo looking all sad and pointing the gun.

54:28.720 --> 54:30.720
Come on.

54:30.720 --> 54:36.720
All this sad music, God.

54:36.720 --> 54:39.720
By the way, I started it like a minute and a half into it.

54:39.720 --> 54:42.720
And then, there you go.

54:42.720 --> 54:43.720
Yay.

54:43.720 --> 54:46.320
Wait, seriously, who did that?

54:46.320 --> 54:51.320
I know, it looks, some people say it might be a viral thing for the movie, that they're

54:51.320 --> 54:55.360
saying it's independent, but it was actually like a viral thing, and then there's the bear

54:55.360 --> 54:56.360
skin rug.

54:56.360 --> 54:57.360
The very end.

54:57.360 --> 54:59.560
That's kind of wrong.

54:59.560 --> 55:02.520
Dark Sakura's rolling her eyes so far.

55:02.520 --> 55:09.560
See, now, if that movie, if that movie had that kind of humor, like it was like an adult

55:09.560 --> 55:16.640
movie, you know, with like violence and titties, how do you have titties in a Yogi Bear movie?

55:16.640 --> 55:18.040
Who cares?

55:18.040 --> 55:23.400
But if you had violence and titties in there, that might be a cool movie.

55:23.400 --> 55:25.600
I wouldn't see that.

55:25.600 --> 55:28.080
I don't remember titties being in the old cartoon.

55:28.080 --> 55:29.080
Exactly.

55:29.080 --> 55:30.080
It doesn't matter.

55:30.080 --> 55:31.080
Who cares?

55:31.080 --> 55:34.840
I don't remember the cartoon being raped across, oh wait, it was now, but I don't remember

55:34.840 --> 55:38.600
it being terrible like this.

55:38.600 --> 55:40.960
Of course the chat room is asking for a link.

55:40.960 --> 55:45.040
I'm trying to get one for you guys right now, but let's get back, do we finish UK dates?

55:45.040 --> 55:46.040
I'm sorry.

55:46.040 --> 55:47.040
Yes, that's it.

55:47.040 --> 55:48.040
Let's get back into some news, Loki.

55:48.040 --> 55:53.720
I just don't understand why we can't have violence and titties in Yogi Bear.

55:53.720 --> 55:55.600
It makes sense.

55:55.600 --> 55:57.600
Think about it.

55:57.600 --> 56:02.960
There was an Xbox 360 dashboard update this week, which pissed me off because that delayed

56:02.960 --> 56:07.360
me from playing my Grand Theft Auto game for a good half an hour, because our internet's

56:07.360 --> 56:12.040
really slow, and the first thing I was worrying about is, is console amusement going to get

56:12.040 --> 56:19.480
banned because it's flash and not hot swapped like the rest of them, because I got lazy.

56:19.480 --> 56:20.800
But no, that wasn't the case.

56:20.800 --> 56:31.420
It was actually a small update to restore, I guess, the planned launch or whatever, basically

56:31.420 --> 56:35.680
the option where you can have the disc and the drive, and when you start the system up,

56:35.680 --> 56:39.320
it'll actually play the game instead of going to the dashboard, and it was something I guess

56:39.320 --> 56:43.120
that broke in the last dashboard update.

56:43.120 --> 56:48.160
And they will have a second update later this week, because I guess they just didn't have

56:48.160 --> 56:57.560
time to finish the update, to darken, I guess, your gamertag pictures or whatever it's going

56:57.560 --> 57:03.440
to be, instead of it being on green or something, now it's on dark gray, which is stupid.

57:03.440 --> 57:04.440
Oh, and the other thing-

57:04.440 --> 57:05.440
What a change.

57:05.440 --> 57:11.840
Yeah, and the other thing is, it also broke the ability to play backups of Call of Duty

57:11.840 --> 57:18.160
Black Ops, Mario Warfare 2, and of course, Halo Reach.

57:18.160 --> 57:20.080
Also known as the real reason.

57:20.080 --> 57:22.280
Yes, the real reason.

57:22.280 --> 57:29.480
What it did was it added the, what was it, the API 2.5 checks, I think that's what they're

57:29.480 --> 57:37.000
calling them, it's a new, I guess, authenticity check that they've been adding to some new

57:37.000 --> 57:46.920
games to make sure they're not backed up, and if, for example, you're playing one of

57:46.920 --> 57:50.720
these games and it happens to be backed up, your console gets flagged for banning on the

57:50.720 --> 57:51.720
next-

57:51.720 --> 57:52.720
We ban you.

57:52.720 --> 57:56.720
The next go around.

57:56.720 --> 58:05.480
Finally, it doesn't always, well, they have the new light touch firmwares for the DVD

58:05.480 --> 58:06.920
drives already.

58:06.920 --> 58:14.680
This is back when the first dashboard updates came out, or actually the new checks and stuff

58:14.680 --> 58:18.960
came out, and they've already patched it out on these drives, assuming you have your drive

58:18.960 --> 58:22.920
up to date, modded and stuff, and there's some drives that actually don't support this

58:22.920 --> 58:26.140
at all, so it doesn't matter, you can patch it all you want, but they can still play backups

58:26.140 --> 58:28.720
all they want and there's no way for them to check.

58:28.720 --> 58:29.720
So that really sucks.

58:29.720 --> 58:36.760
Oh, and there's ways also to patch your games so that they're not checked by this too.

58:36.760 --> 58:40.720
But at least they'll get a good chunk of the people that are playing that.

58:40.720 --> 58:46.220
Me on the other hand, I'm safe for now because I'm not playing Black Ops or Modern Warfare

58:46.220 --> 58:51.880
2 or Halo Reach, and unfortunately I don't think they're gonna be checking episodes of

58:51.880 --> 58:52.880
Liberty City.

58:52.880 --> 58:58.000
Granted, I am playing on a legit copy of episodes from Liberty City, but my drive is flashed

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
in one of my consoles.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
Naughty, naughty.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
It's for testing.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
Of course.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.760
Because my J-Tag's broken!

59:03.760 --> 59:05.800
I have to test it on that right now.

59:05.800 --> 59:09.360
Alright, I'm looking at our chatroom for some comments, and of course everybody's lit up

59:09.360 --> 59:13.920
about the adult Yogi Bear movie, and Salacious Pop is practically writing the movie right

59:13.920 --> 59:15.680
now in some of the chatroom comments.

59:15.680 --> 59:17.920
Hey, uh, boo-boo!

59:17.920 --> 59:20.000
Don't boguard all the coke, boo-boo!

59:20.000 --> 59:21.480
Fuck you, Yogi!

59:21.480 --> 59:25.600
Hey, no bears allowed in the strip club, violent mauling.

59:25.600 --> 59:26.760
What did you do to my car?

59:26.760 --> 59:29.680
Yeah, you know that saying about bears only shitting in woods?

59:29.680 --> 59:30.680
It's wrong.

59:30.680 --> 59:31.680
Puts on aviator shades.

59:31.680 --> 59:32.680
Yeah.

59:32.680 --> 59:37.600
That would be awesome.

59:37.600 --> 59:41.680
Act deaf to her chatroom says, boo-boo has a right to bear arms.

59:41.680 --> 59:42.680
Get it?

59:42.680 --> 59:45.680
That's it, I'm, bye.

59:45.680 --> 59:58.680
Ladies and gentlemen, it took 398, 398 weeks, but this show has officially driven Dark Sakura

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.720
to the brink of sanity.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.840
To madness.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:05.040
I had sanity, ever.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040
That's true.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:10.520
Alright, uh, moving on, one other quick story for you guys, and then we're gonna get to

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.300
the classic game of the week.

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.280
Take it back to the old school way.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:18.840
Don't kick it back 14 years right now, remember when they originally announced Duke Nukem

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.840
Forever?

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:24.680
Oh boy, yes, that's right, Duke Nukem Forever was that game that was announced before some

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.480
of you were probably born.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.920
This game was supposed to come out, and now it finally has a release date.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.760
That's right, it was published in the latest Game Informer magazine, May 3rd, 2011, or

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:42.920
2011, whatever you want to say, is the new release date for Duke Nukem Forever.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.000
That is what Gearbox Software is aiming for.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.760
You know, of course, obviously they're really hyping up this release now, it's like the

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:55.760
game that was never gonna happen, but honestly, guys, once this game kind of changed hands,

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.080
it's happened pretty quickly, and I think it's not surprising that really all it took

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.520
was getting it away from 3D Realms and giving it to someone else.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.080
Hopefully the game, I mean, I don't mean to disrespect 3D Realms, but damn, you never

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080
did anything.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.080
Did you see the trailer?

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.920
Actually, I didn't see the full trailer.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920
It's funny.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.200
Well, let me take a look here.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.200
It's just, when's your birthday?

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.200
When's your birthday?

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:20.160
All right, I'm gonna say I was born in 1931, because that's where my mouse clicked first.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.720
February 1st, 1931.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.720
Here we go.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.720
Fresh and white.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.720
Try mine.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:25.720
It whitens.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.200
Don't show me these goddamn ads.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.200
Just go to Kotaku.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.200
Seriously.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.200
All right, hold on.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.200
Joysick.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.560
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.600
It's gonna be done in a second anyway.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.840
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do, okay, here we go.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:48.640
A to M, of course.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.520
All these establishing shots of...

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.520
They used to tell stories of a man who saved the world.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.520
A man whose very presence sent aliens running back to their mother ships.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.520
A man who disappeared without a trace.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.520
When the invaders came back, they came back angry.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:20.920
They tore our planet apart bit by bit, but they made one mistake.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.120
They shouldn't have gone after our women.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:28.560
Damn it, why do they always take the hot ones?

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.600
You want it.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.600
Nice.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.200
The captions are the best part.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.960
You need it.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.520
Did he just punch that alien in the face?

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.520
Yes.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.920
Awesome.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.320
And now.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.320
Rest in pieces.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.560
We're fucking bringing it.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.960
Nice.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.680
What?

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:04.640
Did you think I was gone forever?

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:10.280
Did they get the original voice actor?

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.280
It sounds like it.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.280
Hell, I'd still hit it.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:25.680
It's this big giant alien with three doobs.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.200
He's peeing.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.800
That's lovely.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.480
That's nice.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.440
That's going on for way too long in this trailer.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.440
I'll be done soon.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.440
Really?

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.440
Oh, how'd it go?

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440
Nice.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.440
I like the vehicle drive.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.440
I think it was cool.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:58.800
It should be good, because this guy just did it out of order land.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.800
Yeah.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800
Coochie coochie.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800
Hail to the king, baby.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.800
What about the game, Duke?

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800
Was it any good?

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:10.800
Yeah, but after 12 fucking years, it should be.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.800
Nice.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.600
Very cute.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.200
With the minute I heard it was going to the guys that made Borderlands, I was like, okay,

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.840
it's in capable hands.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.200
I'm curious to see how the game plays, like a first level walkthrough type of video or

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.400
something, which I'm sure probably exists out there from the Penny Arcade Expo where

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.720
they brought it.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:33.720
But yeah, it looks like it's keeping that same sense of humor, and definitely not holding

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.280
back on the tits and ass.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.280
That's nice to see.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:43.880
I remember reading that everything that's blurred out or bleeped out is actually going

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.880
to be in the game.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.880
Nice.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.880
Very nice.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:52.160
Let's see, our chat room is oversharing as they're watching this trailer here with us.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:57.040
Ed Seton Beaver in our chat room says, I am touching myself to the trailer.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:02.760
Defective Candy says, I have quite literally been waiting for this game my whole life.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:07.080
Bonds006 says, punching it in the face never gets old.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.080
That's right.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.960
Or is it punching ET?

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:14.320
It's not Scott Pilgrim, it's Prodigy, okay?

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.120
It's the Prodigy.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.120
Not Scott Pilgrim.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:21.440
Yes, it was in that trailer, but it's the Prodigy.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.600
There's also a cage match pick that won a couple times.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.600
That's right.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.760
All right, let's get into the classic game of the week.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.800
Enough about this stuff that you had to wait 14 years for.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.600
How about something that was out 14 years ago?

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600
I think it's 12 years.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600
Whatever.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.600
He said 12 years.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.600
I'm going by Duke.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.600
Fine.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.600
It's like 13.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.600
It's like...

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.600
Oh, shut up.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.560
All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:47.040
Fine, excite me with a classic game.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.160
The classic game of the week is Power Stone 2.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.320
Specifically Power Stone 2.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.920
That is a pretty fucking rad game, actually.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920
Power Stone 1.

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.320
Power Stone was great, but Power Stone 2 made all kinds of fun improvements over the first

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.320
one.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.880
So first of all, it's got all of the characters from the first Power Stone, and it's basically

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:09.060
a four-player fighting game, and it's just so much fun.

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.700
You have all kinds of different gameplay.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:14.080
You've got the one-on-one, which is like the original.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.700
It's a two-character storyline game.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:21.280
You have arcade mode, which is a four-character storyline game, and two characters advance

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.280
per round.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.440
Then you have original, which is multiplayer, so you can pick stages and everything.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.120
It's a fun party game.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.720
And then adventure that has an unpredictable storyline, and you can collect cards, items,

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.440
and money.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.720
So yeah, it's got five different stages, and the boss stages, and all kinds of different

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.720
fun stuff.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:46.680
You've got the desert stage that has the Pharaoh Walker, and all kinds of neat things, but

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.680
all of the...

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.880
It even had secret characters like Pride Falcon and Mel, and in the PSP version, you also

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.680
get Kraken and Valgus back from the first game, so that was pretty cool.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.160
I like Jack.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.160
Yeah.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:06.600
I think Jack was cool, although I think for Dan, he was always using Foker, or as they

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:13.120
had him in the U.S. one, Falcon, but you know, because Foker's like Roy Foker from lacrosse.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.720
That's what he always said, so.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.160
Or he's a real mother Foker.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.040
I would always use Ayame.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.520
That was me.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:27.160
But yeah, you can, you know, the stages will change, you know, as you do it.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.880
Like when you've got an airplane stage, the plane will start falling apart, and the characters

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:37.520
will battle as they skydive, and floating platforms, and all kinds of different stuff,

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:41.520
so there's sort of like little sub-levels in each level, and you can get different items

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:47.840
like flamethrowers, and giant hammers, and bear traps, and a magazine, and you know,

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:53.200
you get food, and invisibility, and wings, and all kinds of fun stuff.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:59.160
And you can, you know, drop bombs and icebergs at people, so, really cool, but you've got

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:04.680
like the bad guys, like I said, Pharaoh Walker and Dr. Erode, Dr. Erode is cool, and he has

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:11.320
a power stone of his own, but you know, you get the different stones and you can like

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.640
do super powered up forms and that type of thing, it was pretty neat.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:23.200
And on the Dreamcast, now, this was in the adventure mode, you had like an item shop,

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:28.560
and you could, you know, get different things, and actually the secret character Mel ran

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.960
the item shop, and with the VMU, it had this thing called the mini book, that you can look

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:39.040
at your player's item inventory, you can trade items with other players, and you can register

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.120
things in your inventory as handy items that appear in original mode, so they give you

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.800
this advantage.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:52.760
And if you put the CD, the disc in a CD player, then it plays the same message, well, it plays

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.160
the same message that was used on the Dreamcast one, except there's piano music with it.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.720
And that's a power stone too.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.960
Awesome.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.840
Dreamcast!

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.520
I played a lot of this on the Dreamcast actually, I actually had this game, this is one of the

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.840
few games that you've mentioned from Sega that I actually played a lot of when I was

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:10.840
a kid.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:11.840
Oh yeah.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.840
This is a fun game.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.840
I love this game.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.600
This is not really there, is it?

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.600
No, it should be.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.080
They should do a new power stone.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.120
With this Dreamcast resurgence, that would be awesome, because I know this is a Capcom

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.440
game, not Sega, but still.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.240
We need a new power stone.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.240
And how?

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.240
With eight players.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.240
Absolutely.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:32.000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Power Stone 2.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Good choice, Dark Soccer.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Very good choice.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.040
All right, we're gonna go to a break, guys, it's that time of the show where we take a

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.040
break.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.180
We'll be back though, there's plenty more Orange Laundry to come, we haven't even talked

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.760
about some of the things that were announced at the Square Enix event this week which we're

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:43.760
gonna get into.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.080
A little more news about Duke Nukem Forever, believe it or not, a story about the Rock

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.800
Band Network and some things going on with Apple.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:53.600
And we have to talk about what's going on with the PlayStation hack case, because there's

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.600
more developments.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:58.920
We'll get into all that, plus a story involving boobs, and it's not even a Yogi Bear related

01:09:58.920 --> 01:09:59.920
thing.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.920
We've got all that after the break.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.640
We'll be right back with your Twitter topics, emails, or lack thereof, and more in just

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:13.560
a little bit here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.040
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:24.760
We are live on this Sunday, January 23rd of 2011 for the 398th episode of our little program.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.880
And we've got plenty more news coming up, some rapid-fire news in just a moment, but

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.600
we quickly wanna give some plugs for some other shows that we work on.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.920
Every week, Dark Sakura has a show that she does.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.920
Yes.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.920
With her buddies.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:41.080
Comic Insanity, and you can find it on infamous.net, that's N-F-A-M-O-U-S, and we have a Twitter

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.080
for Comic Insanity as well.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:47.280
And speaking of Dark Sakura, she was the special guest on a special live episode of the show

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.420
that I do with Xtaphir.

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:50.420
It's called Horde House.

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:54.700
The best little Horde House in Azeroth, you can guess it's all about the World of Warcraft.

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.700
Fun times.

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:56.700
It was very fun.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:57.700
I had a good time.

01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:58.700
Good.

01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:59.700
Excellent.

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:00.700
We had a good time doing it.

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:01.700
So check those out.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:02.700
Both available on iTunes.

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:05.840
Comic Insanity, that's the letter N, no I in front, and Horde House.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.400
You can find those both on iTunes or whatever podcasting directory it is that you use.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.760
Let's get into some rapid-fire news, and then the Twitter topics.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.280
You got just a couple minutes to lock those in.

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.360
Twitter.com slash O-L-R for the Twitter topics.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.240
First, some quick news.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.240
Yes.

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:27.200
There's a rumor that an official software development kit for Windows is coming before

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:33.240
the Kinect, and they're saying it could actually be coming within the next few months, which,

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.540
if you think about it, would time just perfectly with Game Developer Conference, and wouldn't

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:41.560
that be something that they would probably want at Game Developer Conference?

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.560
Maybe?

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.560
A little bit?

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.560
Good theory?

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:52.480
It says, apparently, this is coming from a website WinRumors, sources are familiar with

01:11:52.480 --> 01:12:00.080
the plans, and that a, I guess, official software development kit and Kinect drivers are being

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:07.120
prepped for a beta release in the coming months, potentially arriving with the upcoming XNA

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:12.640
update dubbed Community Technical Preview, and the report, I guess they're saying that

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:18.980
there's statements being made by Microsoft's head Steve Ballmer earlier this month saying

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:26.160
that the Kinect support would be coming to PC in a formal way in the right time.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.860
Makes sense that it would be at something like Game Developers Conference.

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:33.960
My bet would be that's when it's coming out, you'll probably see an update to XNA and stuff

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.000
like that around that time as well.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.360
You get support for, I mean it's good anyways, because you get support for the XNA stuff

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.680
for PC stuff, and for the indie games.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:52.360
I'd really like to see what the indie games do with Kinect, it'd be very interesting.

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.360
And scary at the same time.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:13:00.160
Yes, it could be very scary as well, true.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.200
Pixel Force Halo is now free to download.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:08.920
This is the Halo demake by Eric Ruth, who you may remember ran into a little bit of

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:15.480
trouble with his last demake of DJ Hero, but this time though it's kind of a side scroller

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.480
shooter game, so go check it out.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:34.400
And you can find that on I guess bigdownload.com slash games slash pixel dash force dash halo slash pc slash pixel dash force dot halo dot dash free dash game.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.920
Or just do a damn Google search for it, because it's probably a lot easier than writing that

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.840
all down.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:47.760
And then last but not least, speaking of DJ Hero, DJ Hero 2 has added some new trans anthems

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:56.900
this week, and you can get these for $8 or 640 Microsoft points, and they are also available

01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:01.640
separately on the Wii for 300 points a pop.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:10.560
And with that you get Foreign Angel by Paul Van Dyke mixed with 9 PM Til I Come by ATB.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:14.960
Which even though that song I don't really consider like a trans anthem, I do remember

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.880
that it was on a bunch.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.320
And apparently that song is remixed as well, my bad.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:25.720
It was on a bunch of trans albums back when I was buying CDs a long time ago.

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:33.000
Not Over by Paul Oakenfold featuring Ryan Tedder, and Punk by Ferry Corson versus Imagine

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.680
by Armin van Buren, so sounds cool.

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.840
I didn't pick up the pack yet, I don't know, $8 is a lot for something I'll probably play

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:45.040
once and then go heck cool, you know what I mean.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.520
Oh I'll pick up the pack eventually, I bet you will.

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:51.760
Alright, moving on to some other quick news.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.680
An interesting other sequel announced to a game I kind of thought everybody hated but

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:56.680
I guess not.

01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.840
99 Nights, remember this game, it was out on the Xbox 360, and there was even a sequel

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:01.840
to it that came out.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:06.160
I played the original, it's not terrible, it's just not great either.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.580
So I never even bothered with the sequel, but apparently they've decided to justify

01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:15.320
a, get ready for this, MMO, 99 Nights Online.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:21.000
It's an action MMO, Q Entertainment has announced that they are doing this for the PC.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
There will be a number of RPG elements in this, meaning there will be different job

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
classes, there will be PVP, you can party up with other players, and of course, hack

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.300
hack slash slash and all the button mashing you are used to from the originals.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:39.240
It will be a free to play game, so that's pretty cool, microtransactions of course,

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.480
that's how these things work these days.

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:46.840
No word on when this game will announce in North America, if at all, obviously this is

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.800
going to be in other countries first.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:55.280
There you go, Portal 2, big news on Portal 2 this week.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.560
Portal 2 has announced that when it comes to the PS3, it's going to have cross platform

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:02.260
chat between the PS3 and the PC.

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:07.380
That includes multiplayer as well, and get this, you buy the game on the PS3, you're

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:10.140
going to get the Steam version for free.

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:14.560
If you link your PSN and your Steam accounts, you will get the Steam Play version of Portal

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:17.120
2 free, because you have the PS3 game.

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:22.320
So, boy did they just sell many more copies of the Playstation 3 version of this game,

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:27.260
at least versus the Xbox 360, which is really what Sony wanted at their conference I'm sure

01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:31.800
when they came out and announced this whole new friendship they now have with Valve.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:37.040
So they are also saying with this, a quote from Gabe Newell from Valve, quote, we hope

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:42.240
to expand upon the foundation being laid in Portal 2 with more Steam features and functionality

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:47.080
in DLC and future content releases.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.120
Could be very interesting for the future of these two companies working together.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.920
By the way, Cloud Based Storage will also be working on the PS3, which I think they

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.080
had announced before, but it's kind of interesting to see how that's all going to work with the

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.000
PC integration as well.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.840
One other quick story here, and I mean quick.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.160
You know there's a new Justin Bieber movie coming out?

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.920
Yeah, I know right?

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:14.680
Think of how I felt when I had to see that trailer before I went and saw Tangled.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:19.160
Well you know what, you got to give Nintendo props, because they wanted to use a 15 second

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.960
clip of the Super Mario Brothers theme song in the new Justin Bieber movie, and Nintendo

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.800
said no.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.800
Nintendo said no.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800
Thank you, Poop.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:29.800
We'll decline your offer.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.800
Because cereal's more important.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.000
Yes, funny enough, I remember back in the day there was Nintendo underwear you could

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
order from the magazine.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.120
And you think of how bad of an idea that was?

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.120
This is much worse.

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.120
Yeah, that's right.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.120
It's like Underoos.

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:48.360
Oh yes, we may have made a failing cereal brand, and we may have hoarded out our brands

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:56.160
to all sorts of different merchandise out there, but no, we are drawing the line here.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.640
Fuck off, Justin Bieber.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.760
There you go.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.520
They probably just didn't cough up enough money.

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.120
I'm sure that's what these things usually go down to.

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.800
You put the Zelda theme inside, you know, Scott Pilgrim, yeah, but that was a decent

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:10.800
movie.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.440
And it didn't start Justin Bieber.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.440
Justine.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.800
It didn't start Cute Little Lesbian.

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.360
Alright, let's move on with more stories, Dark Sakura.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:27.040
Well for fans of Bejeweled Blitz, it looks like Bejeweled Blitz Live is going to have

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.480
16 player online play with the Xbox Live Arcade.

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.280
So that's pretty cool.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.480
Lots of people can play.

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.000
It's going to be crazy go nuts.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.400
And Dance Dance Revolution is having download content.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.000
Yay.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.720
There's a greatest hits pack that's got Paranoia, Brilliant to You, AM3P, Trip Machine, Put

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:50.720
Your Faith in Me.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.560
And there's a premium pack that's free.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:58.480
This is Let's Get Away, Dreaming Can Make a Wish Come True, and Private Eye.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.400
And just a whole bunch of stuff.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.520
There's a lot of stuff on here.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.000
There's Economics Greatest Hits, which has Be For You, Hire, Burn on the Floor, Hysteria,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.800
Trip Machine.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.800
Really cool.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.520
I think that these are worthy packets.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.960
So hoorah.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:28.880
And also there is video out that has two more characters for Super Street Fighter IV.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.120
There is Evil Ryu and Oni Akuma.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.480
So that's pretty cool.

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.480
Which I kind of saw coming anyway.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.480
Looking forward to that.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:38.480
Yeah there's video out.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.720
It hasn't been officially confirmed, but dude there's video so whatever.

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:43.480
He's got red glowing eyes.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.480
It's Evil Ryu.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.480
Yeah.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.920
They have some better screenshots out there too.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:48.920
Yeah.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:49.920
Like that.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.920
Yeah.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920
It's...

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.920
Yeah.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.920
It's official.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.920
As official as it gets.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:20:00.480
And his moves are the same ones that he had in Alpha 2.

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.480
And Alpha 3.

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:02.480
So.

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:03.480
Whatever.

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.480
It's all...

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.480
Let's see.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.720
This is what it's about.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.720
Arcade Unlocks.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.720
I love that shit.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:09.720
Yeah.

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:13.080
I love that shit when it was around with DDR Max 2.

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:16.040
They got people, got asses in the seats as they would say.

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.040
You know.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.040
Got people to the arcade.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.040
Well.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.040
Fans of DDR.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:24.680
Because I'm sure people that play Street Fighter don't give a shit about DDR.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.920
But that's what they need to do.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.200
That's pretty, pretty badass.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.440
Are we ready to get to the tweets?

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.360
It looks like actually they're just calling him Oni.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.880
I'll take that as a no.

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.960
Which kind of makes sense because...

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:39.960
Anyway.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.960
Okay.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.960
We have tweets.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:42.960
No I know.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.200
I remember when Oni mode in DDR was a big deal.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.600
And everybody was like, what does Oni mean?

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.600
Oni means ogre.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.600
Oh, ogre.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.600
So.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.600
Alright.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.600
Now let's get to the tweets.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:53.600
Tweet tweet.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.400
Every week we invite you guys to show us your tweets at twitter.com slash olr and it'll

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:01.240
invoke some discussion here on our lovely program and you guys sent quite a few tweets

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:02.240
tonight.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.240
So we'll start it off with retertainment.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:07.960
Jumping ahead a little bit here but I'll go ahead since most people know about this already.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:12.320
Final Fantasy XIII-2, shouldn't they be putting their attention towards fixing the fuck up

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.800
that is Final Fantasy XIV?

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.320
Yes, but that's going to take some time.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:21.560
Seriously, Final Fantasy XIV relaunch in the US at least Christmas.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:22.560
If not later.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.080
Uh, I guess later.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.080
Really?

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.080
It's a broken mess.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.600
Well, it is a hot mess but they could do an expansion pack and fix a lot.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.600
Hopefully.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:31.600
Like, you know, add an auction house.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.600
Among other things.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.600
If they expand it, it's more stuff to fix.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.600
It's true.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.100
Alright, let's see.

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:43.520
Spazinator PSM, there are rumors that an MGS HD collection is in the works.

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.960
A Metal Gear Solid HD collection.

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.960
I wouldn't be surprised.

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:46.960
It's a trend.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.960
I wouldn't either.

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:50.680
We've got two already coming out in March.

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.840
We've got the Tomb Raider and the Prince of Persia.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.360
Ah, good point.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.160
So, and they just had the Sly collection.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.640
It's popular nowadays.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.200
Moving on to another tweet from Spazinator, kind of keeping us up to date on the video

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.200
releases.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:09.760
Pilots to Being Human, Perfect Couples, and Fairly Legal are free on Xbox Live, while

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:12.960
Perfect Couples and Fairly Legal are free on PlayStation Network.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.240
If you'd like to sample new TV shows or whatever.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.240
I know.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.240
I have no interest in this.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.360
No, I have a problem with Being Human.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.360
What is, I don't even know.

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.360
What is that show?

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:22.360
Okay, it was a show.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.680
I've watched the first two seasons of it on BBC America.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:29.160
It's a show about, no it's not a comedy.

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.160
No, a copy show.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.360
Yeah, it's about a vampire, a ghost, and a werewolf that live in the same flat.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.040
Sounds like the beginning of a joke.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:40.000
I've said the same thing, but it's actually a really good show, at least the British one

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
is.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.740
I've heard the American one is not so good.

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:46.680
You know, but sometimes they bring shows over from Britain and they're not so bad.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:49.880
Like All in the Family, which is like, you know, a huge American show from the 70s, that

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:51.280
was a British show to begin with.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.600
Sometimes, and The Office has been on for years and years.

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:58.220
I still prefer the British one, but you know, it just depends.

01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:02.320
Usually they'll start the same and then kind of branch off in different directions, but

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.320
I don't know.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.880
If there's this show, I don't know how far do I want to get into this.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.800
Have you heard about that Skins show?

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.680
It's big in the UK, but they made it here on MTV.

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:13.080
Like I have zero interest in that show.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.080
Zero.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.680
Actually, if there's a number less than zero, I have that amount of interest.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.680
Negative infinity?

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:23.120
Negative infinity is my interest level for that, but I can't get away from it on my entertainment

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:25.960
gossip websites, which pisses me off.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:33.280
Act Def sends us a tweet, hey, it's about the PSP2, a little rumor, 3G connectivity

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.720
and a very fancy screen on the PSP2.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:40.120
If this tweet from Act Def is to be believed where he links us to a story on Kotaku, apparently

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:47.040
it's a report from Nikkei that the portable in Japan will be on the NTT Docomo network

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.840
via 3G.

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:55.400
Could that mean like this is going to be like T-Mobile's answer to the iPhone or I don't

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:58.320
know, I'm pulling that out of my ass, but one of the providers that doesn't have the

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.520
iPhone, maybe they'll have the PSP2.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.520
Interesting.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:07.720
They're not saying anything about phone, just 3G connection, kind of like an iPad.

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:10.720
That would be interesting because that means you could play multiplayer anywhere you go.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.520
What would you think about 3G on the PSP2?

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.360
Would that be cool for you, Loki?

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.920
Would you like that?

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:22.680
Here's what it comes down to, and this is with any 3G gaming app, 3G means I need a

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:28.240
fucking subscription for a data plan to somewhere, and that's the killer right there.

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:35.480
I mean, unless it's included in the price of that system, it's going to be fucking expensive

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:41.880
because you're going to have to pay another $100 a month or $60 a month to play your stupid

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.880
system.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:51.880
Wi-Fi, no, no thanks, but then again, if I can do it via Wi-Fi, that's fine, I'll just

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.840
tether it to my phone.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:59.120
Alright, uh, Sturlok sends us a tweet, Crimson Echoes finally leaked, suck it Square, and

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.400
then links us to the story, and I was like, what's Crimson Echoes?

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:08.440
Oh yes, it's the fan-made Chrono Trigger sequel, so the fan-made Chrono Trigger sequel finally

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.480
leaked out to the internet, which we all knew it would, this is the one Square Enix shut

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:15.400
down not that long ago, we all knew it, once it hits the internet it's out, and sure enough

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.720
that's what happened.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.120
Crimson Echoes made its way out, apparently also a game called Flames of Eternity got

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:25.680
leaked, which was I guess a branch-off of the same title, so there you go.

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.560
By the way, I'm looking at the fighting in this game, it looks like Final Fantasy VI,

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.480
it's kind of interesting, maybe it's like a really elaborate ROM hack or something,

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.640
I don't know.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:41.360
Alright, uh, let's move on to, uh, Defective Candy, I like this, sent us a tweet, Connect

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:45.680
hacked for surgical robot, what?

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:50.320
A group of graduate students at the University of Washington have modified the firmware and

01:25:50.320 --> 01:26:00.240
software of the Connect to guide the actions of surgical robots, wow, and it gets into

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.560
more of the details of this, I'm looking for some quotes here, I'm just seeing this story

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.080
for the first time.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.800
The hacked unit adds the sense of touch and feeds information to the surgeon, the setup

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:16.320
could save $50,000 on the standard rig used to perform non-invasive surgery.

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:21.520
We could define basically a force field around, say, a liver, if the surgeon got too close

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.760
he would run into that force field and it would protect the object he didn't want to

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.480
cut, that's weird.

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:33.160
But then, what about the day the machines take over, do you really want a machine operating

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.160
on you?

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.160
Cyberdyne!

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:43.800
Exactly, Skynet, alright, a couple tweets from Tigerclaw, Telltale Games strongly hints

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:49.080
at doing the Walking Dead game, I guess really the title says it all but we're linked to

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:54.360
a story there, The Walking Dead is a show on AMC, and it was a comic book series that

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:58.120
now is this big TV show, I know a few people that are into this, I haven't watched this,

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.880
but apparently Telltale Games is hinting that perhaps they're doing something on this, and

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.400
that was, well Telltale's got a big event going on, they're going to be talking about

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:12.680
five new multi-platform efforts, and I'm assuming Jurassic Park of course is one of those, they're

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:17.740
also saying one of the titles announced is based on a just launched property from the

01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:23.120
TV and comic book world whose popularity is changing life as some know it, so some people

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:28.040
are inferring that from that, sounds like we'll find out in a month, could be interesting.

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:31.800
And then Zeba sends us a couple tweets as well, the Kinect hacker that made himself

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.560
into a bunch of Minecraft monuments has now put those monuments in motion, weren't you

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:39.000
saying something about this, it was during the break or right at the end of part A, I

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
don't remember?

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.760
I was just saying that, we were talking about this like a couple weeks ago, oh was it?

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:50.920
Well there you go, apparently this is a Minecraft monument where now it moves, I still have

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:54.880
never played Minecraft, does that make me a bad gamer, or just lazy, nope, I haven't

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.940
done it either, weird, yeah apparently the Minecraft monument moves at 30 frames a second

01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:04.400
while he juggles three balls, which I guess if you had to kind of create this like bit

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.880
by bit, it's probably a pain in the ass, you know what's better though?

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:11.400
But it's the one that they have where it's a cat chasing a laser.

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:16.200
Mnzeba also sent us a tweet about this, a letter from the Final Fantasy XIV producer

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:21.200
explaining upcoming huge changes, and it's a very long read, and this was just produced

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.960
a little bit this week, they actually did some polls, this is really long, so I might

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.280
have to read this while someone else is doing a story, but yeah, looks like they really

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.080
took this poll and kind of like took some of the feedback to heart, so what are they

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:37.200
talking about?

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:42.800
Tutorials for new players, quests revolving around the danger facing the world, public

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:50.800
company quests, improvements to the log, improvements of dialogue, windows, character jump feature,

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:57.520
interesting, guildlevs, so yeah, they want to do a whole bunch of new shit in the game,

01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:03.200
we'll just leave it at that, there's a long letter available, lodestone.finalfantasyxiv,

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:07.360
the roman wayofsaying14.com, that's where you can find that.

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:10.680
Last couple tweets here, another one from Tiger Claw saying consumer group reporting

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:16.560
Activision to UK Fair Trade Office over black ops glitches, and this is a link to a story

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:22.200
on Gamasutra, it's a British consumer group, The Gamer's Voice, they're going to complain

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:27.200
to the UK Office of Fair Trading about the performance issues in the PS3 and PC versions

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:32.400
of Call of Duty Black Ops, I guess the publisher did not respond to an open letter from the

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:37.280
group one month ago, which talked about the freezing and online multiplayer login that

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.640
the game is not functioning as attended or advertised.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:46.800
So I guess you could say it's kind of like the Better Business Bureau in a way, interesting.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:50.480
So somebody's going to take him to task over that one, I don't know, these things usually

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:54.640
don't end up in much, usually like either a settlement or a letter or something, I don't

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.360
know, but it'll be interesting to see what happens overseas.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.800
One last tweet from Alex Carson, Alex P. Carson on Twitter, do you remember last year when

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:06.360
I made a proposition of you mentioning me on the show in exchange for me raising your

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.680
Facebook fan count?

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.960
I gotta say no, but it was over a year ago.

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:14.400
But I did just name you on the show, there you go.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:19.280
But I gotta be honest, and this is kind of in our philosophy on OLR in general, we don't

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:25.560
just want people, we don't just need numbers, we want people that listen to the show and

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:26.560
enjoy the show.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:30.240
So yeah, of course, you know, we always ask at the end of every show, tell your friends

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:34.320
about the show, but you know, and again, I'm inferring a lot from this tweet, but of course

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:39.480
don't spam, don't spam, we don't need to sink to that level, and you know, I think it would

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.200
be awesome if your friends would join the Facebook page, but only if they really want

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.200
to hear the show.

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.920
If they're not into video games, you know, maybe this isn't the show for them.

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:50.960
Maybe they need to subscribe to a sex podcast, woohoo, so.

01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:53.760
But we always appreciate any efforts, absolutely.

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:57.800
And I'll even read your Twitter name on there, there you go.

01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:58.880
Alright!

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:03.400
Let's move on to some more gaming news, some phone calls coming up in just a little bit,

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:04.400
as well.

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.400
Mmhmm.

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:12.680
Um, so the court case against, um, Geohot has been delayed, and as we kind of alluded

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:20.200
to last week when we were talking about it, um, we brought up how it's being held right

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:27.460
now in San Francisco, but he's from New Jersey, and so, um, you know, there was a whole question

01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:29.640
over the jurisdiction and stuff like that.

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:32.480
I remember talking about that last week, yeah.

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:38.400
Because according, you know, to, uh, the judge, it says if having a PayPal account were enough,

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:43.520
um, then there would be personal jurisdiction in this court over everybody, and that can't

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:44.520
be right.

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:49.920
And, um, so the case is pending further discussion over jurisdiction, a decision Sony is likely

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:57.680
to frown upon, um, and, you know, now, seeing as how the hack is, you know, completely available

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:06.600
online, and as I mentioned earlier, um, you know, installing it on your system is so stupid

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:12.600
easy now, especially if you want to install custom firmware that people have made, which

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:18.420
have gone a little bit beyond what Geohot, um, had wanted, and kind of, it could lead

01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:25.440
to piracy, um, I mean, it's, it's literally just flashing your console in the recovery

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.440
mode.

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.440
That's it.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:35.360
Um, yeah, I, I don't know, it's gonna be an interesting case.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:40.040
Yeah, story's gonna come up every damn week until they settle.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.040
Exactly.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.040
Well, and then-

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.040
I don't think they'll settle either.

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:47.320
And then you have companies using it, the whole PS3 hacking thing, as an excuse.

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:53.280
According to Infinity Ward, um, I'm assuming this is what's left of Infinity Ward, um,

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:59.680
Modern Warfare 2 has been, or has been kind of made unplayable, thanks to people hacking

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:03.720
the game, and it says Infinity Ward cannot patch a fix.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:10.920
Um, people are saying it's a total shambles, it's unplayable, um, according to Infinity

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:17.300
Ward's games rely on security of the encryption on the platforms they're played on, um, unless

01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:21.880
the security exploit itself is resolved on the platform, updates to the game through

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.480
patches will not resolve the problem.

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:28.800
At this time, we do not have any ability to restore or adjust individual stats.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:38.920
Uh, we're looking at every option to help us, um, help any user affected, and, um, here's

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.280
what's funny about this whole thing.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:44.040
See, they put it out around the time when all these hacking stories, you know, with

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:50.360
the whole keys and stuff being released, um, were put out, but, if you look at the big

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:54.340
picture here, it's actually, this was happening before all that happened, and it's because

01:33:54.340 --> 01:34:01.340
people have been hacking save files, and they've been doing that, um, so this is totally unrelated

01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:07.280
to anything that has to do with those PS3 keys, and on top of that, um, they're doing

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.760
the same thing on the 360, they're hacking save files and stuff, and that stuff's been

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:18.860
kinda been patched, um, so, really comes down to, they just don't wanna fix it, and if you

01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:20.400
think about it, why would they?

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.960
Modern Warfare 2, eh, whatever, so it goes to shit.

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:23.960
Buy Black Ops!

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.960
So, I don't know.

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:34.720
Interesting, I, uh, there's no way to just track down who's fucking up the game and just

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:35.720
ban them?

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:40.960
Um, they, maybe they could, but, you know, they could just create another account, I

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:41.960
guess.

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.120
They'd have to actually track down systems.

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:45.120
Interesting.

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:48.640
Sorry about that, you cut off there in the beginning.

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.000
So wouldn't that go back to the laziness factor?

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
I think so.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
No.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Yep.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.960
And here's the thing, though, is people aren't actually reading into this, they're kinda

01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:02.920
saying, oh, well, thanks GeoHot for, you know, doing all this, now Modern Warfare 2 is unplayable.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:07.880
If you're gonna believe everybody and what they say, and without doing actual research

01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:13.840
into what's going on, then sure, go ahead and blame those hackers, but it is different.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.720
It's a special kind of hacker out there.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:20.980
It's the little kid that figures out, oh, hey, I can grief somebody this way, or I can

01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:25.200
cheat in this game, and, you know, screwed up for everybody.

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:30.480
It's just like, you know, in the whole Grand Theft Auto, you know, hacking or modding community,

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:34.000
there's people that actually wanna make stuff that's kinda cool, and then there's people

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.200
that wanna make cars that freeze people, or guns that freeze people's games, because they're

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:41.420
douchebags, and that's what they do.

01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:45.600
So no matter what you do, those douchebags will find a way to be a douche.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.880
Play with your friends and nobody else.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:48.880
Exactly.

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.320
That's sadly where some of this is going, honestly, online.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.440
If you wanna play a legitimate game, you gotta play with your friends.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.000
Take your ball and go home.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Ha!

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.800
All right, some news coming out of Square Enix this week, revolving in a tweet a little

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.320
bit ago, kinda references.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:06.760
Final Fantasy XIII-2 was announced, and it's coming out for the 360 and the PlayStation

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.760
3.

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:11.100
It was during the little press event that Square Enix had this week.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:14.040
There's a little trailer that goes with it as well.

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.060
We won't play that one like we did the other one, though.

01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:19.760
But we will say that in the little logo, you can see that there's this whole little like

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.720
contrast character to lightning, so that there's kinda like, I don't know, an anti-lightning

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:26.000
or what it is.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.600
Now they are saying that Final Fantasy XIII-2 is set to launch in Japan in 2011, but that's

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:32.920
probably just Japan.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.760
They're not saying anything about the US just yet.

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:37.480
Oh no, they said next winter.

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:38.480
I'm sorry about that.

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.920
They said next winter was the release.

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:44.280
Does that mean next February or next December?

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.840
Because you could kinda take that a couple ways.

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.360
Hopefully it's a quick cycle.

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:50.760
I mean, I'm assuming this is just gonna be done in the same engine as the first game

01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:56.800
was, but just, you know, new story, some new models and all that stuff.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:59.600
Hopefully more dreshsphere, right?

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:00.600
Yay.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:03.060
Okay, maybe not.

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:06.280
The name of Final Fantasy Agito XIII has been changed.

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:10.520
It's now Final Fantasy Type Zero, which would explain some of the stories in the past couple

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.080
weeks about these trademarks showing up.

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:17.560
Final Fantasy Type Zero is the game that is coming out instead.

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:22.400
It is gonna be on the PSP, of course, and they just said that this title just seems

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:27.520
to be more appropriate because this is a more action-oriented design of the game.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:28.520
And there you go.

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:29.520
It's gonna be coming out to the PSP.

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:34.380
30 voiced characters in the game, multiplayer supposedly in it as well.

01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:37.960
Nothing announced just yet for what's going on in North America, but it is coming out

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:42.000
to Japan this summer on two UMDs.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Not one, but two.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.720
That must be a big game.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:48.280
We'll see.

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:53.360
Well, how about going back to something that we touched on earlier?

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.360
Yay!

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.960
It's like a blast from the past.

01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.960
Yes.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.360
Duke Nukem Forever!

01:37:58.360 --> 01:37:59.360
Yay.

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.000
Is there gonna be download content?

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Is there?

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Huh, huh, huh, huh?

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Um, probably.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.720
Well, they haven't announced anything about it, but they are saying that they are trying

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:15.280
to, and this is a quote, on making possible the UNpossible shipping Duke Nukem Forever.

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:20.800
Um, but they are saying that there could be some download content, that they are keeping

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:23.160
the future in mind.

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.920
So I'm sure there will be.

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:27.760
Build your own strip club DLC.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:28.760
Yay!

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.400
I want voice macros to come back.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.720
That'll be nice.

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:33.480
I wouldn't be surprised if they have DLC.

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:37.560
I mean, look at the awesome DLC they had for the original Duke Nukem 3D.

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:41.480
They have the fourth episode, the Atomic Edition, which is just awesome.

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.720
I love the supermarket level.

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:47.520
I love the level that was kind of Disneyland, but not, you know, the Pirates of the Caribbean

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.400
ride and stuff.

01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:50.400
Awesome.

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.880
I just miss Duke Nukem Deathmatch.

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.800
That was awesome.

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.400
I hope this game is as awesome as the old Duke Nukem was.

01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.400
I really do.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.400
It looks pretty neat.

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.400
It does.

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:02.400
It does.

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:07.360
The trailer's sense of humor is any indication, but, you know, how often do games look cool

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.520
and they suck?

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.960
Just as a reference as the original.

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:11.960
Yes.

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:18.800
There are some developers out there developing for the iOS platform that are pissed off at

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:27.320
Apple because they just don't take piracy or theft seriously.

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:31.280
Theft in this case happens to be a game called The Blocks Cometh.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:35.920
It's an iPhone game that's out there right now that's completely ripped off of a Flash

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:36.920
game.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.080
It didn't just copy the game.

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.720
They took the name, they took the assets, the music, everything.

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.920
They ported it over.

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:46.600
Unfortunately, it's not by the creators.

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:49.120
It's by somebody else.

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:53.200
The creators of the actual game actually have a version for the iPhone that's in the works

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:55.520
right now, but they're pissed off.

01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:01.920
They contacted Apple and their customer service or whomever has said their legal department

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:09.320
has contacted the people responsible for it and they've kind of given them the runaround,

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:15.160
but there's nothing really that they seem to be doing.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:19.880
It's kind of a serious case if you think about it because it's not just, oh, this game is

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:24.320
sort of like Angry Birds or this game is sort of like something else.

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:29.120
This is literally, we took this game, stole everything from it, and threw it on there.

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:36.400
If I created Super Mario Brothers and popped it onto the iOS, Apple's app store and stuff

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:37.400
like that.

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:38.400
Well, could you?

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:42.080
I mean, if this game gets by, why hasn't someone done that yet?

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:44.080
Maybe they need to.

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:52.040
Super Mario Brothers or Great Giana Sisters, I don't know, take your pick.

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:53.040
That is pretty serious.

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.800
I thought when I first was reading the subject of the story, I was like, oh, maybe Apple's

01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:59.120
not doing anything about the people that are copying the iOS, but you're talking about

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:02.640
they've actually approved and highlighted games that were just ripped off of shit on

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.640
the internet.

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.640
That's crazy.

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.800
It is actually promoted to the What's Hot section.

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:10.080
I have a feeling a lot of that runs on an algorithm, though.

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:15.680
I don't think that they necessarily specifically targeted that game to promote.

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:16.680
I think you're right.

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:17.920
It's probably getting a lot of downloads.

01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:22.200
It's probably been getting a lot of downloads because of the coverage, honestly.

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.200
Is it a pay game, though?

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.240
Yes, it is a pay game.

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:28.360
Pay games aren't worth it.

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:31.800
By the way, AlphaCananagram, I don't know if you saw this, he's following up in chat

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:34.200
saying they have taken it down since then.

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.040
So it is no longer there.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.880
But look at what it took for that to happen.

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.880
I think that's still fairly notable, you know what I mean?

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:43.280
Nobody saw that right away.

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:47.120
But of course, if I'm working at Apple and I'm testing these apps, am I gonna recognize

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:48.300
this game?

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:49.300
Probably not.

01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:54.780
You know, they don't do the peer review thing like XNA does, where lots of people are prone

01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:57.080
to recognize stuff that's ripped off.

01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:00.660
But if it's just like a couple people at Apple, I mean, I would never recognize that this

01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:01.660
game was ripped off.

01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.640
I'd never played the original.

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:11.000
So in that way, I can kind of sympathize, but I guess they do need something else.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.320
Maybe they need a quicker way to stake your claim if you do believe you've been ripped

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:16.320
off.

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:17.320
Maybe that's what they need.

01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:18.320
I don't know.

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:19.320
Maybe.

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.320
We'll see.

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:29.560
Alright, so let's move on to another story that has to do with the Rock Band Network.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:32.800
Woohoo, Rock Band!

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.840
Rock Band Network 2.0 is coming out in February.

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:39.380
February 15th is the date to be exact.

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:42.200
That's when the new track creation system will come out.

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:47.360
All songs currently being made for Rock Band Network, they must be done by February 14th

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.880
when 1.0 will be phased out.

01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:54.300
And then everything after that for Rock Band Network 2 will require Rock Band 3.

01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:58.420
I'm assuming this means because of, you know, the keyboards and all that other stuff.

01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:01.180
So there you go.

01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:05.760
By the way, Rock Band 3, sadly not doing too well on the sales charts, did it?

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:08.160
It didn't do too well after Christmas, did it?

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:09.160
That's too bad.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.160
Still awesome.

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.160
Still awesome.

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:12.440
I agree.

01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.520
Maybe forcing people to upgrade will do some good.

01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:18.440
Maybe they should just cut slash the price of the game to 20 bucks and watch it fly off

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:19.440
shelves.

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:21.480
Hey, I have a friend that bought the Pro Guitar.

01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:22.480
Oh yeah?

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:23.480
Yeah.

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.480
It's pretty heavy.

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:26.480
It's pretty cool too.

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:34.080
Alright, so with that, I guess we're going to get into the mailbag at mailbag.orangeloungeradoo.com

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:37.720
is the place where you send us emails every week.

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:41.520
So we're going to get into the mailbag.

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:51.720
Well, we actually, well, the mailbag kind of sucks because we've got nothing in it.

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.920
Read the spam!

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:56.080
Well, we don't have any spam either.

01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:01.040
So I dedicate this to everyone who did not send an email.

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.040
I'll take the box!

01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:03.040
The box!

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:04.040
You took the box!

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.040
Let's see what's in the box!

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.040
Nothing!

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:07.040
Absolutely nothing!

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.040
Stupid!

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:09.040
You're so stupid!

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.040
Stupid!

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.040
Stupid!

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.040
Stupid!

01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:13.040
Stupid!

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:14.040
Stupid!

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:15.040
Stupid!

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:16.040
Stupid!

01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:17.040
Stupid!

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.040
Stupid!

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.040
Stupid!

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:29.080
You're so stupid!

01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:30.080
Nice.

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.080
Yeah.

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:35.520
You know, that's the movie that Dan and I got engaged over.

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:36.520
I know.

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:37.520
I remember that.

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:38.520
Yeah.

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:41.240
You want a drink from the fire hose.

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.240
You know what's funny?

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.240
Wheel of Fish.

01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:45.880
I don't think I've ever seen that movie from start to finish.

01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:47.280
No, the best thing.

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.280
Badgers!

01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:49.280
Badgers!

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:53.560
We don't need no stinking badgers!

01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:56.240
Weird Al needs to do another movie, don't you think?

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:57.560
He totally does.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.560
Alright.

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:01.560
Uh, let's move on to the FUs of the week.

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.640
What an appropriate time to get into this segment.

01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:21.040
Now I know we have some of these.

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:27.960
F you to certain situations that are beyond my control that involve finances and my house.

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:28.960
Logie?

01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:35.560
Uh, F you to the people at A&W for not knowing how to fill up a half gallon of root beer.

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:41.360
It was actually, not to mention, it is impossible to transport this without it spilling everywhere

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:45.600
as it was, and um, it made it very difficult to drive.

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:49.680
I will never be buying a half gallon of root beer again, it is just too much root beer.

01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:51.320
Half gallon of fucking root beer, Logie.

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.800
It's a half gallon of root beer.

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.120
It's not carbonated enough.

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.120
I don't understand why.

01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:57.320
A&W from the tap is supposed to be the bomb too.

01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:59.000
Yes, it's really sweet though.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
It's really, really sweet.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
It's like drinking syrup.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.480
Their diet root beer is excellent though.

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:07.880
But yeah, I like their root beer.

01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:10.880
Uh, my FU of the week, I have to be vague.

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:13.720
There's actually a lot of stuff going on but nothing I can talk about on my public show,

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:15.840
so F you to stuff.

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:16.840
That's all stuff.

01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:18.840
There you go.

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.360
So, let's get back to some gaming news.

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:25.400
Then the Skype line in just a little bit after a couple more stories.

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:26.560
Logie, you need to cheer me up.

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.280
Do you have a story that might cheer me up?

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:29.280
Um, yes.

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:34.160
It's about the brand new Yogi Bear movie.

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:36.280
No, I'm not cheered up.

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:39.840
No, it's about Tiger Woods and a weird glitch.

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:41.280
This really isn't cheering me up.

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:47.380
It's about a weird glitch that is being reported, I don't even know if we should take this seriously,

01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:48.960
by The Sun.

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.240
Yes, the tabloid magazine in the UK.

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:59.520
Apparently there was a glitch that this one woman has encountered, Brit and Joe, um, Elay

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:06.080
or whatever, apparently her avatar that she had set up on there, one day, when she popped

01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.120
on the game, it was topless!

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:10.200
Oh, now you have my attention.

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:11.200
What?

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.200
What's this?

01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.200
Nipples and everything.

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:14.200
What?

01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:22.600
The, uh, the avatar is topless and of course EA was quick to say that, um, there is no

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:28.080
possible way that that could have been done without some sort of hack.

01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:33.600
But as we've seen with, you know, games like Heavy Rain, I could believe that it could

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:40.360
be done, um, you know, granted she doesn't actually have like boob textures or whatever,

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:45.120
you know, the nipple bumps are there for like the clothing and stuff, but I don't think,

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:49.920
I think that just for some reason it's not drawing the clothing on.

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.840
But, uh, she's topless and playing golf.

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:54.840
Boobies!

01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:56.520
You know what?

01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:00.080
You get those women topless and playing golf, I bet you a lot more people-

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:04.960
I bet, I bet Tiger Woods would sell like twice as many copies as it does now.

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:09.120
Tiger Woods, the M-rated golf game.

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:11.440
There you go.

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:14.840
Well, it just took a story about boobies to cheer me up a little bit.

01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:15.840
Tiger Boobs.

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:16.840
Tiger Boobs.

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:18.520
I like that.

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:25.360
All right, Xbox 360 is going to be seeing the return of some Wonderswan color shoot-em-ups.

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:26.720
That's right, that's awesome.

01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:30.240
Judgment Silver Sword, I guess, is one of those games.

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:33.920
It was originally designed in a homebrew competition in 2001.

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:35.900
It was published in 2004.

01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:38.700
It's now coming back on the Xbox 360.

01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:43.880
Judgment Silver Sword and the remix Cardinal Sins, they are both going to be coming out,

01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:49.120
I guess, their bonuses in a new 360 retail shmup, Eshkatos?

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:50.920
I don't know if I'm saying that right.

01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:53.520
Of course, all these games are coming out in Japan.

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:57.040
There's two trailers for this game that are out there on the internet.

01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:59.040
You can import it on March 24th.

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.640
I like this because I guess there's like one trailer here that shows like a split- because

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:07.800
you know how like vertical shmups on the 360 don't use much real estate on the screen at

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:08.800
all?

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:11.600
Like there's all this wasted horizontal space.

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.160
Well in this game- sorry it's a little loud, sorry guys.

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:19.160
It looks very pretty, I gotta say.

01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:22.520
Like some of the effects they're doing and stuff, but then there's one part of the trailer

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:28.800
here where they're showing multiplayer in like three screens on the screen at once.

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:31.680
That's cool.

01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:33.960
That's very cool.

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:36.880
And then they're dodging lots and lots of bullets.

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.880
They're dying.

01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:42.680
WonderSwanColor shmups making a return on the 360, but only in Japan!

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:45.520
Which makes sense because WonderSwanColor was only out in Japan, never came out here.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:47.920
It was such a good system too.

01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.460
Our Skype line is now open!

01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:56.000
You can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.780
You can go ahead and give us a call, we'll talk about whatever it is you want to talk

01:49:58.780 --> 01:49:59.780
about.

01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:02.280
In the meantime, should we see if there's any last minute stories because I know it

01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:06.560
takes about a minute till the folks that are listening hear us begging for calls.

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.240
There's a rumor, well we talked a little bit about this, the 3G and stuff, and the OLD

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:15.000
screen on PSV2 already, I'm assuming, that was in Twitter Topics now that I think of

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000
it.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Yep.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Okay, nevermind.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.720
I had to pull it up and I was ready to go and everything.

01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:21.720
Sorry.

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:26.280
I know I have more stuff to talk about here, I just have to pull it up.

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.280
Do do do.

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:28.280
Ummm.

01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:30.280
What was I gonna say?

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:31.280
Words?

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:32.280
Words, yes.

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:42.280
Specifically, no I was gonna say that those people out there that are thinking about possibly

01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:46.880
hacking your Playstation 3 using the readily available custom firmwares that are out there,

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:53.820
you may remember that they have ways of tracking you down, so make sure you get one of those

01:50:53.820 --> 01:51:02.360
things that erases your game history or something like that.

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:10.080
A lot of the new programs have that built in so that you don't get caught, I guess.

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.680
LA Noire.

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:16.960
That was a game that also had a trailer leaked out for it.

01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:24.080
Also gonna be coming out from Take-Two in May, this on May 17th, big game for Rockstar.

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:27.120
I mean it looks awesome.

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:31.200
So that'll be coming out in the middle of May there.

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:36.200
Also Plants vs. Zombies and Peggle coming to the Android Marketplace the second quarter

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.560
of this year.

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:39.560
Pretty neat.

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:47.080
Again, the phones are open, 1-877-GAM-OL-R or use the name on Skype is Orange Lounge

01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:48.080
Radio.

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:50.080
It's gonna be another one of those nights.

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:54.200
Get your lazy butts up, pick up your phone, and give us a call.

01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:57.160
If you have something to say, I mean, you're just gonna sit here on the line.

01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:02.760
Talk about a video game and you better not be, um, what's your face?

01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:05.960
Now see, I saw this story and I thought of you, Jamie.

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:12.600
Epic Mickey, you're talking about 10 different Easter eggs that are in this game from different

01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:14.200
Disney history and stuff like that.

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:22.280
For example, in the game, actually in Mickey Junk Mountain, they actually have a basketball

01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:27.840
court in that part of the game as well.

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:28.840
That's cool.

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:32.200
They kind of allude to the basketball court that's in Matterhorn.

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:34.640
Let's go to the phones, we do have a call on the line.

01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:36.040
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:37.040
Who's this?

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.040
Hi, can you hear me?

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:39.040
Uh, we sure can.

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:40.040
Who is this?

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.520
Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.

01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:43.920
DDR Dollar Bill, what is on your mind?

01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.920
Hey, not much.

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:50.080
Um, I took your advice a couple weeks ago and then I actually picked up a, well, I guess

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:54.080
you can call it an indie game, but one that's been getting a whole bunch of hype from everybody.

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:55.080
What's that?

01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:56.080
Minecraft.

01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:57.080
Ah, okay.

01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:01.040
Now, for those that didn't hear, you called in a couple weeks ago and I believe it was

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:04.440
something about, I am just frustrated with games today.

01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:09.280
It's same shit, different year, you know, I feel like there's no games for me to play

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:10.800
and I said, well, try indie.

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:14.120
So you went for a popular indie title, but an indie one nonetheless.

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.120
Minecraft.

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.120
What do you think of Minecraft?

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:18.120
Hello?

01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:21.100
Did we lose him?

01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:22.100
Can you still hear us?

01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:23.100
God damn it.

01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:24.100
I think we lost.

01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:25.100
Hi, can you hear me?

01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:26.100
Yes, we can now.

01:53:26.100 --> 01:53:27.100
Hi.

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:28.100
What did you think of-

01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:29.100
Oh, pfft.

01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:30.100
Hi.

01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:31.100
Stupid microphone.

01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:32.100
Did you mute yourself?

01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:33.100
Hi, can you hear me?

01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:34.100
What did you think of Minecraft?

01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:38.600
Um, for a beta, I'm very impressed.

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:39.600
Yeah?

01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:46.000
Yeah, it's weird in that it's the total freedom to do anything.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.800
It's almost like, I feel like I have nothing to do, but I'm just enjoying just doing nothing.

01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:54.200
Okay, I have never played Minecraft.

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.960
I read a lot about it on the interwebs, but I've not played it.

01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:59.340
So can you like, tell me what Minecraft is?

01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:02.680
What do you do in Minecraft?

01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:11.640
The best way I can say this is, you pretty much make stuff to sort of build, well the

01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:16.460
idea is that you pretty much have to build your shelter and your tools and everything

01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:21.480
out of different parts you find here and there, and during the day, and you have to make good

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:28.400
shelter because at night, you get invaded by zombies and skeletons and spiders, so you

01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.040
want to be safe at night, and then you do the same thing every day, like daytime you

01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:39.920
build stuff and raise trees and make flowers and kill animals for food, and at night you

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:42.080
pretty much either hide or you defend yourself.

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:45.840
Okay, so there is like kind of an actual game to it, because I was always under the impression

01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:50.720
that there really wasn't a lot to it outside of like creation and building, so that's kind

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:51.720
of cool.

01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:55.480
Okay, so you're trying to prevent, I guess, zombies from eating your face.

01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:58.840
I like stuff, so that's kind of cool.

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:04.100
So did this help kind of break your video game blahs, or are you still looking for that

01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:08.400
game that just makes you love video games again?

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:13.960
It sort of helped kill the blahs because I also realized that I'm pretty much a PC gamer

01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:17.600
for life now.

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:22.760
I've pretty much shied away from PS3 and Xbox, and I like playing on a PC a lot better.

01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:23.760
Why?

01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:25.720
I'll give you an example.

01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:31.800
I tried out the demo the other day for Mass Effect 2 just for shits and giggles.

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:37.880
It ran so much better on my computer than on the Xbox or PS3.

01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:42.680
So it's more a matter of you feel like the technology that the games need today, maybe

01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:45.160
the console cycle's gone on too long.

01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:49.120
You know, let's face it, the 360's been out now, it's going on its fifth year, right?

01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:51.960
So maybe it's time for some new consoles?

01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:59.360
Either that or some heavy updates and whatnot, because my computer's not that old either,

01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:04.240
but it was running circles around the console, so I was like, what the hell?

01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:11.280
Well a lot of it has to do with your video card as well.

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:12.280
That's a big part of it too.

01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:14.320
So you have a newer video card in your system?

01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:20.060
Yeah, I mean I got one just last year, it's still a newer one.

01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:26.360
My process is old, but it's one of those things where logically it doesn't make sense, but

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:27.360
it just works.

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:30.600
I'm going to a chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.

01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:33.800
Bochi Kawa says, Minecraft is like Legos, the RPG.

01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:37.800
You know there is actually a really fun, just a Lego builder game that is on the official

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.800
Lego website.

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:42.240
It's not really a game, it's like a tool where you just have a virtual box of Legos and you

01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:45.700
can put together whatever, and then of course it's to sell more Legos.

01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:49.740
You click a button and they will send you the bricks you need to make your thing.

01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:50.740
You just built.

01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:51.740
Which I think is kind of amazing.

01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:52.740
Oh wow.

01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:54.360
I know right?

01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:59.720
Some other comments in chat, Bonds006 says, Same here, I will always be a PC gamer.

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:03.040
And Alex P. Carson says, PC greater than fucking anything.

01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:05.400
So you have some people supporting you on your side.

01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:06.400
Absolutely.

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:07.400
Awesome.

01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:08.400
Alright.

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:11.600
Well, DDR Dollar Bill, we're going to let you go to get some more calls, but any quick

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:13.600
final thoughts for our listeners?

01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:15.280
Uh, yeah.

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:16.280
Support PC gaming.

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:17.600
Alright, we'll try.

01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:21.320
And hey, Steam is going to save PC gaming, if it hasn't already.

01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:22.320
Hey, Steam rocks.

01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:23.880
Alright, and the indie stuff of course.

01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.440
Alright, have a good one buddy.

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:26.440
You too, thanks guys.

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:31.480
Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype if you want to give us a call.

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:33.800
Any other last minute stories for us?

01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:34.800
I have nothing.

01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:35.800
Aww.

01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:36.800
Um, sure.

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.440
You'll just have to make something up.

01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:41.360
Dark Soccer, wait, no, I want Dark Soccer to make something up.

01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:43.040
Make up a video game news story.

01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:46.040
Something that actually didn't happen.

01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:51.720
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:55.280
I'm putting her on the spot people, it's live radio.

01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:56.280
Chirp.

01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:57.280
Chirp.

01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:00.520
Oh, a new Angry Birds game is coming out?

01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:05.560
Yeah, a new Angry Birds versus Dark Soccer.

01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:08.680
Angry Birds versus Angry Co-host.

01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:12.600
I was going to say Angry Birds versus Zombies.

01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:18.960
Of course, because everything indie these days is something something versus zombies,

01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:19.960
right?

01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:20.960
Indeed.

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.200
Let's go to another call.

01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:23.200
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:24.200
Who's this?

01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:25.200
Hey, this is X-Link.

01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:26.200
Hey buddy, how you doing?

01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:27.200
Hey, doing good.

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:30.880
I got to play with the PS3 move for my first time.

01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:33.080
Ah, what'd you think of the PS3 move?

01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:35.560
I, I, depending on the game, I really like it.

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:43.720
Um, though I did like the, um, bowling, um, and, um, the, um, the, the sports one they

01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:45.680
had out, it was, it was pretty fun.

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:47.560
It was, it was a lot of fun.

01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:52.960
It had a lot of similarities to that of Wii, but it, the, the graphics and the way they

01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:54.600
did it was a lot better.

01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:58.840
The, um, output and the way it was controlled was, I think, for personally, for me, it was

01:58:58.840 --> 01:58:59.840
a lot smoother.

01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:00.840
So.

01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:04.920
Do you, I mean, maybe this is a really hard question to ask, but it's something I've given

01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:07.280
a lot of thought to myself is that, okay.

01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:11.200
And I've said this on the show before, you know, connect and move they're out there now.

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:15.800
And most of the games that have come out originally are for the most part with a few exceptions,

01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:18.920
copies of Wii games, you know, and with nicer graphics.

01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:21.240
Where do you think the move goes next?

01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:24.760
Can you see the move integrated into Sony's core franchises?

01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:25.760
The world.

01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:27.640
It's going to become the world like that of.hack.

01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:33.920
We're going to have visors and everything, and it's going to become one big MMO.

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:35.840
It already is in their core franchises.

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:38.600
A lot of it seems, a lot of it really feels like an afterthought though.

01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:39.760
Like LittleBigPlanet 2.

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:42.400
Yeah, the move supports there in a bonus level.

01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:43.680
No, I understand that.

01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:44.680
That's just retarded.

01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:47.160
That's just basically the prehistoric thing that's in there.

01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:54.400
Um, no, I'm saying it's in their core franchises as in SOCOM 4 and Killzone 3.

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:55.680
Those are core franchises.

01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:56.680
Okay.

01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:59.360
Granted, I don't pay attention to a lot of the first person shooters.

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:00.360
That's why.

02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:03.000
And I remember seeing that at the GDC even, but.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:09.200
Granted, their gun that they have, their little shell, is retarded looking.

02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:10.200
Just saying.

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:12.040
No, I agree with you.

02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:13.640
I agree with you on that.

02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:18.280
I'm hoping that people will step up to the planet on those things and make stuff better,

02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:21.320
like actual better looking guns and stuff like that.

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:26.520
Um, you know, like, for example, like Time Crisis with Namco, I like the guns they use.

02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:29.760
It makes you feel like you're playing the arcade with their actual guns, so the guns

02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:34.560
are quite different from that of the arcade because of the feedback and whatnot, but.

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:38.840
And there's no pedal button, but still, I think they will do good.

02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:41.320
It's moving in the right direction, I believe.

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:42.320
What was the-

02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:46.200
It's sad, though, because it's really killing off stuff like arcades and stuff that I grew

02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:47.480
up loving as a kid.

02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:49.720
It's just, you know, it's hard to compete.

02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:51.840
Well, I don't think the move killed that.

02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:57.560
I think Xbox Live and just the internet in general killed that.

02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:58.560
MMOs.

02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:02.520
Yeah, you know, MMOs for real used to be going to the arcade, you know.

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:03.520
I don't know.

02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:04.520
It's depressing.

02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:10.360
Instead of booting up your computer or your Xbox and playing the games, yeah, it really

02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:11.360
was.

02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:14.280
And it was a lot of fun playing your quarters and stuff on top of the, you know, on top

02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:18.360
of, you know, in certain areas saying, hey, look, I want to be next, you know, or have

02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:20.720
to be, you know, waiting in line, you know.

02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:23.840
I guess maybe save that 20 minute wait from playing that one game that you really want

02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:24.840
to play.

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:28.080
But at the same time, too, you know, it's kind of sad, you know.

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:32.720
That, you know, that feeling you got being around a big crowd and they're cheering you

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:33.720
on and stuff.

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:37.200
It's not really the same.

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:43.280
Yeah, I think it would be cool if they would make, like, an MMO that kind of, you know,

02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:45.240
if you can't beat them, join them.

02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:47.280
Make an MMO about, like, going to arcades.

02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:48.280
That's what game room should have been.

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:53.040
Like, an MMO where you're going to the arcade and playing these old school games and the

02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:56.560
better you get at games, the better you can skill up your character to maybe help you

02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:57.720
get, like, cheap.

02:01:57.720 --> 02:01:59.800
I don't want to say cheap but get better in other games.

02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:00.800
I don't know.

02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:01.800
There's an idea there.

02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:02.800
No.

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:03.800
I agree on that.

02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:04.800
That'd be cool.

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:05.800
What's the best thing you played on Move?

02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:06.800
I'll kind of end it with that question.

02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:10.480
Well, unfortunately, I only played two different games, so probably the bowling because I did

02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:14.840
really well against my friends on that one, so the Bronx took bowling.

02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:15.840
Okay.

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:21.240
Also, really quickly, Gearbox, I think, is going to do really great with the Duke Nukem

02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:25.360
because they did a really great job with Borderlands and their DLC.

02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:31.200
So if they keep it close to making somewhat of the original feel, from what I've seen

02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:33.800
from the trailers and stuff, I think they're going to do a really good job.

02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:37.240
It's going to be really, really interesting to see what they do with it.

02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:40.520
And I know they really are with their fans and what the fans want.

02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:44.220
So I wouldn't be surprised if they make some kind of mod so you can build your own strip

02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:48.320
club or build your own miniature bat.

02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:52.800
I would see a lot of that probably coming out near and down the road also because a

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:57.640
lot of feedback has been really positive on it, and they really want what the people want.

02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:01.560
So that's been a really good, positive thing too.

02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:07.960
One day we'll have our arcades again, but we'll take that next great invention to bring

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:09.840
people back.

02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.720
More beer in arcades, that's what it really needs.

02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:15.400
Because you look at the arcades that are popular, Dave & Buster's, the Retro arcades, they all

02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:16.400
serve beer.

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:20.720
Well, there's one by where I used to live, believe it or not, that did the same thing

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:22.280
too, and it was very popular.

02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:23.280
Less kids, more beer.

02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:27.400
Again, it was beer at EDR, so I mean, pretty much go hand in hand, so yeah.

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:28.400
All right.

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:31.400
All right, well buddy, we're going to let you go to try and fit in a couple more calls,

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.400
but have a good one.

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:33.400
Yeah, you too.

02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:34.400
No problem.

02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:35.400
All right, thanks.

02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:36.400
Bye.

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:37.400
All right, so let's go to another call.

02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:38.400
Hi.

02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:39.400
You're on Orange Mountain Radio.

02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:40.400
Who's this?

02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:41.400
Hey, it's Zappi.

02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:42.400
Hey, Zappi.

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:43.400
How you doing?

02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:44.400
Oh, pretty good.

02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:45.400
All right.

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:46.400
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:51.400
Well, I've been playing one of the big releases of the week, well, only big releases of the

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:56.000
week, Little Big Planet 2, and I can't say more than, I mean, like, it's awesome.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.400
All right, so let me ask you some of the same stuff I asked Loki in the beginning of the

02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:01.040
show, because I haven't played the game yet.

02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:04.640
What did you notice right away, or maybe not right away, but what did you notice were some

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:07.920
differences from Little Big Planet 1 when you played the game?

02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:14.480
I learned that there's, like, a lot more variety when I'm playing it, like, Little Big Planet

02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:18.640
1 was a good, solid platform, but with the second one, they really, like, tried to make

02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:24.600
it different, having, like, different, like, gimmicks in it, like, sort of, like, how they

02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:31.440
had notions for Mario World, where they, like, shook up the gameplay a little bit, and, like,

02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:36.800
for example, like, there's some levels that are just like, oh my god, I'm playing a shmup,

02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:43.200
or there's other ones where you're controlling a giant rabbit, like, they really, like, made

02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:47.120
it interesting and, like, they're like a full sequel instead of, like, just something, like,

02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:48.520
shoveled on.

02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:50.920
So what's some of the cool stuff you've seen in the user-created levels?

02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:53.680
I don't know if you've had a chance to dip in there, but have you seen any really cool

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:56.760
user-created stuff yet?

02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:01.040
One of the cool things I saw was they made an entire tower defense game out of the Little

02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:02.040
Big Planet engine.

02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:03.040
Oh, wow, nice.

02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:09.520
Yeah, I was kind of surprised that you do that, but they designed this in mind that

02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:15.360
you can basically take whatever game ideas you want and make it, which is really exciting.

02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:19.400
Speaking of taking whatever ideas you want and making it, I have to, and I apologize

02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:22.600
from deviating from your call a little bit, but, you know, in the last call, we were talking

02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:26.040
about ways to save arcades, and, of course, our chat room's going off on that.

02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:33.320
sj100matt says, tits could save arcades, and xlink says, now, that could be a good idea,

02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:35.480
so maybe you need to mix strip clubs with arcades.

02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:41.560
When in doubt, show some tits, right, DarkSakura?

02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:42.560
How about some cock?

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:44.400
All right, well, that could work, too.

02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:47.480
There could be something for everybody, absolutely, I agree.

02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:48.480
Boobs and nuts.

02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:49.480
Equal opportunity.

02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:50.480
Boobs and nuts.

02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:52.480
Boobs and nuts.

02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:57.400
You know, there was an old-ass game on the NES, I really apologize, by the way, there

02:05:57.400 --> 02:06:01.880
was an old-school game on the NES years and years ago, it was only out in Japan, not out

02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:06.720
here, it was called Nuts and Milk.

02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:11.880
I shit you not, look it up, it's on Wikipedia, Nuts and Milk, and that could be the name

02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:13.880
of the arcade.

02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:14.880
What's that?

02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:16.840
How does that get past censors?

02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:22.320
Because it's Japan, it's not the same, they don't have the same slang, it's different,

02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:23.320
so all right.

02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:28.520
Oh yeah, LittleBigPlanet 2, so have you played the Nuts and Milk remake in LittleBigPlanet

02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:29.520
2 yet?

02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:33.800
I'm sure it's coming along any day now, but unfortunately no.

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.760
Oh, okay, that's too bad.

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:40.400
All right, so, anything else you've been playing lately, just LittleBigPlanet 2 taking up your

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:41.400
time, or any other games?

02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:46.080
I've also been playing some Dead Space, the first one, looking forward to the new one

02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:50.720
that's coming out this week, and I can't believe you missed this game in 2008 because it's

02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:51.720
really fun.

02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:57.440
Because it went off my radar for so long, I'm going okay to make a second one, there

02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:04.240
must be something to it, and I can't believe it, it's really going back to the survival

02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:08.120
horror roots, where you're actually being freaked out, like you're thinking that something

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:11.600
is around that next corner, and there might be.

02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:16.360
It kind of sucks when games like, you find out about them like three years after they

02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:21.140
were out, and then like, by the time you're like, this game was fucking rad, you found

02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:24.800
out that the development studio got closed, and everybody got laid off, like I bet you

02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:27.720
anything that's gonna happen to blur.

02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:32.040
When the game's down to 20 bucks, if it's not already, it'll start selling more copies,

02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:37.360
and then people are like, wow, they should really make a sequel to this, oh shit, they

02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:38.360
should.

02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:42.600
Yeah, it's a shame that happened, like blur was pretty fun.

02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:46.400
Alright, well anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight before we let you

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:47.400
go?

02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:48.800
I don't know, that's it.

02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:52.280
Alright, well have fun with LittleBigPlanet 2, hopefully I'll be playing it pretty soon

02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:55.560
as well, just you know, gotta wait to save up the money.

02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:56.560
Okay.

02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:58.560
Alright, later buddy.

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:03.720
877-Game-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a

02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:04.720
call.

02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:07.960
If you want to give us a call, call came in from Canada.

02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:09.280
Maybe he had said that before, he was kidding.

02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:13.160
My friend just got back from Toronto, actually, he's coming back in tonight, you know, Grandpa

02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:18.440
Warcraft, went to Toronto, went to Toronto and just coming back tonight.

02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:19.440
Cool.

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:22.560
Yeah, I want to go to Toronto, I've never been.

02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:24.400
Here it's really fun, Vancouver's awesome though.

02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:25.400
I want to go to Vancouver.

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:28.440
Like how can Toronto be better than Vancouver, I'm sure there's a lot of people living in

02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:33.520
Toronto that are mad at me for saying that, but seriously, Vancouver is awesome, awesome.

02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:35.600
Let's go to the phones, there's more calls coming in.

02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:38.720
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:39.720
This is Chortles.

02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:40.720
Chortles!

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:41.720
Hi buddy, how are you?

02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:42.720
Hey.

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:44.720
Hey, what's on your mind tonight?

02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:45.720
Chortles?

02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:52.160
Um, honestly, I was just considering, is it just me or is it PlayStation, like, okay let's

02:08:52.160 --> 02:09:00.160
put it this way, you know how Activision, is it true that you on PlayStation Network,

02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:05.920
these publishers have to put out the servers themselves for the multiplayer?

02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:14.640
Because I've been considering that in the wake of, like, okay I'm not sure if I'm overhearing

02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:19.600
this, but basically, have you heard the reports about PlayStation Network getting hacked recently?

02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:21.600
Loki, is that something familiar to you?

02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:23.680
The PlayStation Network's been getting hacked recently?

02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:26.760
I don't follow that stuff as well, so you don't really.

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:30.920
I'm sure somebody's trying to hack it.

02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:34.520
Which probably includes PlayStation Network and all this stuff with the Modern Warfare

02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:35.520
and so on.

02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:38.440
Yeah, I'm sure you've heard that.

02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:41.600
I just want to jump quickly back to your question about the whole central servers and who's

02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:42.960
really running them.

02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:46.880
I think to some extent the publishers are running, I mean, I don't know the ins and

02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:50.880
outs of games, but like for example, EA, we just had a story on them a couple weeks ago

02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:54.280
that they were shutting down the servers for a bunch of old sports titles.

02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:59.280
So I think they do run servers, I think what Microsoft and PlayStation, what they're running

02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:02.560
is kind of like the matchmaking and distribution services.

02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:06.040
When you download upgrades and so forth, it's coming from their servers because they're

02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:07.880
getting a cut of the profits.

02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:11.560
When you're connecting to find opponents, it's probably through them.

02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:14.760
But then when you're actually playing the game, it's probably through the publishers.

02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:20.140
I also would cite things like DC Universe, which is sort of a gray area because that's

02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:23.240
Sony Online Entertainment, so maybe less.

02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:25.640
But what about things like Final Fantasy XI?

02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:32.520
I mean that game, people forget it's on the 360, but it is, and it is such a unique game

02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:34.200
because it has two front ends.

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:38.400
It has Xbox Live, which you don't even need gold, but then you use it to basically connect

02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:43.800
to Play Online, which is really the central, I mean, Final Fantasy XI literally breaks

02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:47.040
every single rule you know about Xbox Online.

02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:50.760
And nobody's playing it on the Xbox, which is interesting.

02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:56.400
I guess most people aren't looking to it for Final Fantasy XI, but the reason I was wondering

02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:02.000
that is because on the one hand, you know, you have the whole idea about, oh, you get

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
–

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Yeah?

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Go ahead.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Yeah.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000
I'm sorry.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.160
I just realized that I'm actually hearing what we just said previously for like a few

02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:12.880
seconds later as background echo.

02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:16.560
Good old school first rule of calling into radio, turn down your radio because it throws

02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:17.560
everybody off.

02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:18.560
It's all right.

02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:19.560
Yeah.

02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:20.560
Fair enough, man.

02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:21.560
Yeah.

02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:30.440
I was just considering that in the fact that Activision has a deal with Microsoft to have

02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:33.760
released the DLC first on 360.

02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:38.080
Isn't that likely for the next two Call of Duty's at least as well?

02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:42.360
I'm not sure of the specifics of the agreement, but it's certainly not uncommon that one console

02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:45.440
gets download content that the other consoles don't get.

02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:46.440
That's –

02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:47.440
At least earlier.

02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:48.920
I think buying exclusives for forever.

02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:52.600
You wanna cite another example, look at what's going on with the PlayStation 3 and Portal

02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:54.840
2, which we talked about in the rapid fire news earlier in this whole like –

02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:55.840
Oh, I heard about that.

02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:56.840
Yeah, the cloud –

02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:58.720
Is Portal 2 coming to 360 by the way?

02:11:58.720 --> 02:11:59.720
It is.

02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:00.720
Okay.

02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:04.320
But Sony is really trying to do everything they can to make theirs, and this is the quote

02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:08.840
from what they said at E3, the definitive version of Portal 2.

02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:09.840
Uh-huh.

02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:10.840
Ooh.

02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:14.880
Well, which is really funny considering that that means free access to the other two versions.

02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:20.560
Yeah, I mean to the home computer versions, which come to think of it, that's actually

02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:22.520
a business model I really like.

02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:32.240
You pay for the game once, and then you have the game period in whichever way it's playable

02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:33.600
other than 360.

02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:37.640
I love that model too, and think about the caller that called in – I don't know if

02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:41.560
you heard the guy earlier that called in saying that he's all about PC gaming now because

02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:45.320
consoles just aren't doing it for him, and the games run better on his PC.

02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:47.880
I think he'd be frothing at the mouth about an idea like that.

02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:52.400
Imagine buying Mass Effect 2 on the PlayStation and you get it on all consoles.

02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:55.680
Yeah, like that would be my sort of thing.

02:12:55.680 --> 02:12:59.120
I mean, I could not get enough of that.

02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:08.080
I mean, it's funny that he revived his love of PC games because – okay, I'll just

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:10.760
let you know what I've been doing over the winter.

02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:18.600
Basically, I think one of the only games that I bought for a console in 2010 was Assassin's

02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:19.600
Creed Brotherhood.

02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:22.560
Mind you, that was a launch game.

02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:24.480
It was immensely satisfying for a while.

02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:30.960
I don't regret that purchase, but then after a while it petered out, especially when it

02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:35.880
came to trying to get good connectivity for the multiplayer, and while there were some

02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:40.800
severe issues with lag and multiplayer –

02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:41.800
The baby escaped.

02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:47.640
There's a baby in the background that appears to have escaped.

02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:48.640
You know what?

02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:55.920
Let me put it this – I'm not going to pretend how she would know the word lag.

02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:59.520
I'm just going to leave it at that.

02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:01.120
Dark Soccer, can you get CPS on the line?

02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:02.120
No, I'm kidding.

02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:03.120
I'm kidding.

02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:04.120
All right.

02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:11.200
I'm sorry if this is boring everywhere when it's listening in, but basically I found

02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:18.160
that over the holidays I was doing my Christmas shopping, and unlike last year, I found that

02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:21.640
there wasn't much that I was looking for in the way of Steam.

02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:26.000
I mean, yes, I know about the legendary Steam holiday and summer sales.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:31.160
I have partaken of them in past years, but this time I found that even though I was sitting

02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:36.840
on a nice chunk of change, I mainly just wanted to upgrade my hardware.

02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:43.440
For example – okay, main thing that I changed is my video card.

02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:51.840
Originally I was using onboard video, don't ask, but as a result, basically this time

02:14:51.840 --> 02:15:02.280
around I decided to upgrade to a Radeon HD 5770 made by MSI, one gigabyte.

02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:10.260
I think a lot of the draw for me was the cooling, like two fans, three heat pipes, a heat sink.

02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:15.400
It was pretty cool stuff, and so far it seems to run all my games decently.

02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:20.520
You know, I think with the PC it's really about the hardware, making the right choices

02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.240
with that, and if you invest with that, you're going to get a huge payback.

02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:27.600
I mean, I know I upgraded my video card last year so I could run Warcraft better, which

02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:29.520
is the only PC game I need to be playing.

02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:30.520
No, I'm kidding.

02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:31.520
There's lots of them.

02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:32.520
Oh, no, no.

02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:36.200
Hey, I've played World of – like, I've played World of Warcraft for a long time.

02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:40.880
I jumped – like, I took the weak trial for Cataclysm, but I'm not paying for that right

02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:47.360
now, although I will give this advice to anyone who plays World of Warcraft.

02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:51.680
Even if you take a break in the form of, like, canceling your subscription or not playing

02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:54.120
a while, get the Battle.net authenticator.

02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:59.240
Like, if you don't already have it and you use a smartphone, just get the mobile authenticator.

02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:02.240
Because you don't want people using your account while you're not there.

02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:07.360
Yeah, I've actually had that happen to me in – like, in the summer of 2010.

02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:13.480
Like, two weeks after – two weeks after my subscription ran out, boom, my account

02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:15.080
was hacked.

02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:18.840
A lot of stuff – a lot of stuff got stolen.

02:16:18.840 --> 02:16:26.160
My – like, my all-time highest level item got jacked, and by the time I found – by

02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:33.280
the time I found out, got my account unhacked, and got back into World of Warcraft, it was

02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:35.560
too late for Blizzard to recover my stuff.

02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:39.600
Yeah, and it's a story I have heard way, way, way too many times.

02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:43.120
But, Chortles, I've got to wrap up and let you go, because if I keep letting you talking,

02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:44.680
pretty soon they're going to give you our time slot.

02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:46.920
So I've got to wrap up and let you go.

02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:47.920
Find the baby!

02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:51.520
Well, if I set out, I'll probably have – I'll probably be more focused next time,

02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:52.520
I suppose.

02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:54.160
That baby has walked out the front door by now.

02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:55.160
Go get him.

02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:56.160
All right.

02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:57.160
Yeah, all right.

02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:58.160
All right.

02:16:58.160 --> 02:16:59.160
Bye.

02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:01.280
Thank you, Chortles, for that call.

02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:03.560
He was just really happy to be here.

02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:04.640
He just – he sounded happy.

02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:05.640
I like enthusiasm.

02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:06.640
Brains!

02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:07.640
Brains!

02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:08.640
Give him the call.

02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:09.640
He was just enthusiastic.

02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:10.640
Brains.

02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:11.640
You're saying it was a zombie baby in the background?

02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:12.640
Yes.

02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:13.640
I'm – all right.

02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:14.640
Be nice.

02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:15.640
All right.

02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:16.640
Thank you so much for the Skype line tonight.

02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:17.640
Thank you guys so much for calling us.

02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:19.840
If you didn't get through tonight, please consider sending us an email.

02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:24.360
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails to.

02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:26.280
We would really appreciate it.

02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:27.940
All right.

02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:29.800
Let's wrap up the show.

02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:30.800
We're done.

02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:31.800
Is there any other last-minute stories we've got to get out?

02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:32.800
Ribbons and bows, Rob.

02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:33.800
Ribbons and bows.

02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:34.920
Spanking on the butt.

02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:35.920
It's done.

02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:36.920
Slack.

02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:37.920
I have nothing.

02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:38.920
All right.

02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:41.560
Then let's go around and get everybody's final thought, and we'll start with Loki

02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:42.560
tonight.

02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:43.840
Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:50.240
My sound card decides when it decides to work and not – and I don't like that.

02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:54.720
My final thought is I took Friday off, so yay for four-day work week next week.

02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:55.720
Woo!

02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:57.680
Dark Soccer, you have a final thought?

02:17:57.680 --> 02:17:58.680
Reject false icons.

02:17:58.680 --> 02:17:59.680
Ooh.

02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:00.680
You're going old school.

02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:01.680
I am.

02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:04.280
I didn't expect you to whip that out until episode 400.

02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:07.240
Let me whip this out.

02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:08.240
She's just getting warmed up.

02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:09.240
Yeah.

02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:10.240
It's been a very long time since I've heard that one.

02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:11.760
I'm warming up my bitch-slapping hand.

02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:12.760
All right.

02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:16.280
Well, thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting Independent Podcasting.

02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:17.840

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.720
We'll ram other things down your throat.

02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:26.720
Shh.

02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:27.720
Stop.

02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:29.720
Like candy.

02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:32.840
Dark Soccer is like, I got a lollipop.

02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:34.240
Tell friends – I'm trying to do a plug.

02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:36.400
This is a very important plug I'm trying to do here, Dark Soccer.

02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:37.400
Stop derailing me with your toilet humor.

02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:38.680
Are you plugging it already?

02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:39.960
Stop it.

02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:45.160
Go on to iTunes or whatever favorite podcast site you use and leave us a nice review.

02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:46.320
We would really appreciate it.

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:48.960
Five Star Reviews on iTunes helps go a long way to promote.

02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:50.520
Tell your friends about the show.

02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:54.920
Tell people you think would be interested in people talking about video games and giving

02:18:54.920 --> 02:19:01.680
folks a voice and hearing people call in and just talk about games they really like.

02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:02.680
That's it.

02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:03.680
Tell your kids.

02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:04.680
Tell your wife.

02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:05.680
That's right.

02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:07.280
And tell your husbands because we're gaming everybody out there.

02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:08.280
Exactly.

02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:09.280
I think.

02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:10.280
We're going to do it for another week.

02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:13.280
We will be back next week to do it all again.

02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:14.280
I'm so excited.

02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:15.280
I just can't hide it.

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:16.280
We'll see you next week.

02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:19.560
