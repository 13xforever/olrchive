00:00.000 --> 00:20.320
Today, January 9th, 2011, a popular PC game prepares for release on Xbox Live.

00:20.320 --> 00:24.720
More details come out about the next Elder Scrolls game, and EA prepares to disconnect

00:24.720 --> 00:31.400
the servers for several old games.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.080
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:35.080 --> 00:38.560
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.560 --> 00:44.240
We do tape live at All Games Radio every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

00:44.240 --> 00:48.080
ish right after the Bobby Black Wolf show wraps up.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.400
We really like Bobby because he always has us on our show and does this nice little transition.

00:52.400 --> 00:57.640
Tonight, we were talking about light-up cereal boxes, but before we get to yummy delicious

00:57.640 --> 01:01.800
electrical cereal, let me introduce the cast and crew here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:01.800 --> 01:06.040
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always is the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie

01:06.040 --> 01:07.040
Summers.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.040
Hi.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.040
How are you?

01:09.040 --> 01:10.040
I'm hungry.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.560
What would you prefer, electric Trix or electric Honey Nut Cheerios?

01:12.560 --> 01:13.560
Neither.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.560
Why?

01:14.560 --> 01:15.560
Because I hate both of them.

01:15.560 --> 01:19.160
Well, what electric cereal would you like?

01:19.160 --> 01:20.160
Frosted mini-wheats.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.480
Grape nuts.

01:22.480 --> 01:28.040
I do adore grape nuts, but I'd have to say my favorite cereal of all time is frosted

01:28.040 --> 01:29.440
mini-wheats.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.000
I'll get to my favorite cereal in a minute, and yes, we'll talk about games too, but say

01:33.000 --> 01:35.520
hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.520
Hi.

01:36.520 --> 01:37.520
Hi.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.520
How are you, Loki?

01:38.520 --> 01:39.520
I'm fine.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.720
I'm finishing my last piece of honey barbecue chicken.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.600
What was your favorite cereal growing up, honey barbecue chicken nuggets?

01:44.600 --> 01:45.600
Hell no.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.200
Actually, you know, it's kind of funny.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.240
I like both extremes of cereal.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.760
Like, really bad for me cereal and really good for me cereal.

01:52.760 --> 01:53.760
It's weird.

01:53.760 --> 02:00.520
Like, I used to, and I still do, like Special K. Yes, the chick cereal.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.520
It does not...

02:01.520 --> 02:02.520
I forgot about that.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.680
That's one of the greatest moments of this show's history was when it came out that you

02:06.680 --> 02:08.360
enjoyed Special K.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.360
It's pretty good, actually.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.360
Cereal for women.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.360
It's not bad.

02:11.360 --> 02:17.340
You know, Special K, I actually, long time ago, I used to like Total and Product 19.

02:17.340 --> 02:21.160
You know what got me hooked on that stuff is, you know how they used to give you, like,

02:21.160 --> 02:26.160
when you buy the camping packs of the little cereals and stuff like that, and you'd be

02:26.160 --> 02:29.440
left, after you eat all the good ones, you're left with, like, okay, Special K and stuff.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
And they're not bad.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.600
I mean, so it kind of got me hooked on that.

02:32.600 --> 02:37.200
But on the other side of the spectrum, and I go through about a box of this a week, Cap'n

02:37.200 --> 02:38.200
Crunch.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.200
Really?

02:39.200 --> 02:42.200
The one that is always last in the package for me is Lucky Charms.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.000
I hate Lucky Charms.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.800
And well, Cinnamon Toes Crunch, but here's the thing about Cinnamon Toes Crunch, I hate

02:48.800 --> 02:49.800
it with milk.

02:49.800 --> 02:54.680
So I have to eat it dry, and it's just really, because all the cinnamon falls off.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.760
I don't like cereal with milk at all.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.280
I eat all my cereal dry.

02:58.280 --> 03:01.600
Like I know that's really weird to some people, but that's how I do it.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.120
You know, the other one is really addicting?

03:05.120 --> 03:07.760
Was it Golden Grahams?

03:07.760 --> 03:09.400
I can't stop eating that stuff.

03:09.400 --> 03:14.200
Now, you can't have a video game show and talk about cereal without bringing up Nintendo

03:14.200 --> 03:15.200
cereal.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.280
Did anyone ever try that when they were younger?

03:16.280 --> 03:17.280
I liked it.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.280
I thought it was hideous.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.280
Really?

03:19.280 --> 03:20.280
I didn't mind it.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.280
I thought it was pretty good.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.280
I didn't like kid cereals.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.280
I hated marshmallows.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.280
I still hate marshmallows.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.640
Nintendo cereal was closest probably to Froot Loops, because I still remember it was more

03:27.640 --> 03:29.480
like fruity and sugary.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.480
I think that would be the taste it was close to.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.240
See, Froot Loops weren't really big on my plate either.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.240
I mean, they were okay.

03:33.240 --> 03:36.560
I just, I didn't like- I don't remember Nintendo cereal having marshmallows.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.560
I don't think it did.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.520
Let's break into the shredded wheat.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.440
I would say my favorite breakfast cereal of all time, and this might surprise some people,

03:43.440 --> 03:44.440
is Crispix.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.160
Oh, Crispix is good.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.160
That's the one that's-

03:47.160 --> 03:48.160
I fucking love Crispix.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.720
That's like half rice on one side, half corn on the other.

03:49.720 --> 03:50.720
Oh, that stuff's good.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.720
And gluten-free.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.720
I don't know what it is.

03:52.720 --> 03:53.720
It's amazing.

03:53.720 --> 03:54.720
It's my favorite cereal.

03:54.720 --> 03:55.720
It's not even a sugar candy cereal.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.120
Damn, I need to get a box of that.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.680
It's so good.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.680
It's the texture.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.680
Like, I can't- it's so gross, but it's the truth.

04:02.680 --> 04:06.480
Like, I love putting Crispix and then, like, using my tongue to smash it to little bits.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.800
I'm like, haha, and then eat it.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.200
I used to do that, too.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.520
Everybody does it, just no one talks about it.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.360
And then I would eat one half of one side, and then eat the other half.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.240
It's like eating an Oreo with no cream filling.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.240
It's with milk filling.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.680
I remember when they first brought Crispix out.

04:19.680 --> 04:26.560
I mean, that was something that came out later on in my life.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.760
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.440
Of course, we have to introduce the chat room.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.760
We love the chatters.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.860
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

04:32.860 --> 04:36.160
Dark Tetsuya wants to know, are there any cereal podcasts out there?

04:36.160 --> 04:40.200
I don't know, but maybe we need to start one.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.320
We'll have to look for one.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.400
I don't know.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.800
And many folks in our chat room agree- Yes, there's one called the Ethereal Cereal

04:45.800 --> 04:46.800
Podcast.

04:46.800 --> 04:47.800
Shut up.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.800
Really?

04:48.800 --> 04:49.800
I just found it.

04:49.800 --> 04:50.800
Is it really about breakfast cereal?

04:50.800 --> 04:51.800
That's what I'm going to find out.

04:51.800 --> 04:52.800
Or maybe it's just a funny name.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.800
Alright.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.640
Well, anyhow, we will talk plenty more about breakfast cereal.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.000
There's one called Get Cereal.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Food and everything.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.520
But we have to talk about our gaming weeks.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.200
We've got to bring it back to video games.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.200
It is a new year.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.200
It's 2011.

05:04.200 --> 05:09.360
It's kind of a tiny, tiny lull in new games right now, because everyone I think is catching

05:09.360 --> 05:11.960
up from last year's games.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.480
But things are going to hit the ground fast.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.860
Little Big Planet 2, I believe, is this week.

05:16.860 --> 05:19.800
And that's just going to be the first in several huge, huge releases.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.800
Oh, next week.

05:20.800 --> 05:21.800
Loki's correcting me.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.280
I knew it was January, mid, somewhere.

05:23.280 --> 05:27.140
But very soon, that's going to come out, and that's kind of the first of several bing-bing-bing

05:27.140 --> 05:28.140
big stuff coming out.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.140
DC Universes this week.

05:29.140 --> 05:30.140
Oh, yeah.

05:30.140 --> 05:31.140
DC Universes this week.

05:31.140 --> 05:32.140
Thank you, Loki.

05:32.140 --> 05:33.140
So I'm going to be quitting World of Warcraft.

05:33.140 --> 05:37.720
When I played the beta on PC, I had a good time with it.

05:37.720 --> 05:42.240
So I never did get around to playing the PS3 one, and they pulled the plug on it.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.640
So I'm torn.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.920
I don't know if I really want to get into DC Universe or not.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.640
But anyway, I guess we can talk about that later.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.880
Let's talk about what's going on right now in your gaming week.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.080
Dark Sakura, start us off.

05:52.080 --> 05:56.120
I hit level 63 right before the show.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.820
I just can't believe this.

05:57.820 --> 06:00.640
You hated World of Warcraft three weeks ago.

06:00.640 --> 06:01.640
They changed it.

06:01.640 --> 06:02.640
You know what's funny?

06:02.640 --> 06:05.320
The podcast is behind right now, and I totally apologize.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.320
That's my fault.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.720
I've just been, you know, slacking, whatever.

06:09.720 --> 06:16.380
But if you go listen to the last show on the feed right now, I'm pretty sure you were still

06:16.380 --> 06:19.320
hating on World of Warcraft and Razami for playing it.

06:19.320 --> 06:24.880
So podcaster-only people have no idea that you have now leveled to 63.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.800
Not last week, because last week was after I got back from Washington.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.120
No, the last show on the archives was-

06:30.120 --> 06:32.840
Oh, on the archives, yeah, yeah, no.

06:32.840 --> 06:38.480
Well, they changed enough in it that I was like, okay, I gotta give it a try.

06:38.480 --> 06:44.120
Because you know me, I'm not gonna bitch about something without having tried it myself.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.120
Good.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.600
I think that's a good thing to do.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.200
I mean, and besides that, I just like fucking with you guys, you know?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.200
No, I know, I know.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.840
It's just like I mess with you for some of the things you like, but secretly it's all

06:53.840 --> 06:54.840
right.

06:54.840 --> 06:55.840
It's fine.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.760
Which for the record, I haven't touched Second Life since the last time I said I haven't

06:57.760 --> 06:58.760
touched Second Life.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.840
And for the record, Grape Nuts aren't so bad.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.840
They're actually pretty good.

07:02.840 --> 07:03.840
Grape Nuts are great.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.840
They're great!

07:04.840 --> 07:05.840
Anyway.

07:05.840 --> 07:09.440
I, on the other hand, think Grape Nuts are nasty, and you really shouldn't touch Second

07:09.440 --> 07:12.120
Life ever.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.920
Some things never change on this program.

07:13.920 --> 07:22.280
So anyway, anyway, um, I, well, okay, I know last week, live, I, you know, mentioned that

07:22.280 --> 07:27.200
I had really hurt my lower back, my, it was technically my right hip.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.200
Really bad.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.720
Although it's more funny to say I sprained my butt, because really it's-

07:31.720 --> 07:34.080
You broke your butt, ugh!

07:34.080 --> 07:39.880
But, um, I've been seeing my chiropractor, like, I have one more appointment to go to,

07:39.880 --> 07:43.820
and it still hurts, but it's not nearly as the debilitating pain I was in before.

07:43.820 --> 07:49.840
So like, all I could do is just sit here, on an ice pack, and play World of Warcraft,

07:49.840 --> 07:50.840
because what else was there for me to do?

07:50.840 --> 07:55.240
I've done everything in Star Trek Online, and I still love Star Trek Online so much,

07:55.240 --> 07:57.680
but all I was doing was freaking playing Dabo.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.800
And there's only so much gambling one can do.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.720
I really like this point in our chat room here from Salacious Pop.

08:03.720 --> 08:08.640
In my opinion, this just proves that Blizzard properly redid the experience in Cata, which

08:08.640 --> 08:09.640
was the point.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.240
1-60 was still from 2004 and shitty.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.000
If Jamie likes it now, then they really gave it an overhaul.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.960
Well, and now Dan was like, oh, they dumbed it down for people so that people can, you

08:19.960 --> 08:23.060
know, have a more rewarding experience, and blah blah blah.

08:23.060 --> 08:26.720
And I was like, you know, when I first, when I first started playing, this was, you know,

08:26.720 --> 08:28.960
when I got Burning Crusade.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.820
When it was new.

08:31.820 --> 08:35.080
It was like, okay, I've done everything, I'm not going anywhere.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.800
I've done all this, I'm not going anywhere.

08:37.800 --> 08:38.960
Fucking boring.

08:38.960 --> 08:43.260
Same gameplay over and over and over and over and nothing interesting.

08:43.260 --> 08:44.840
And I think that's a big part of the change too.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.820
I don't want to go too far into this, because again, we have the Separate Warcraft show

08:47.820 --> 08:51.480
now that, you know, because we talk too much about it on this show, but it's important

08:51.480 --> 08:55.520
because where Warcraft goes, like it or not, it is the biggest MMO right now.

08:55.520 --> 09:00.000
The rest of the industry will follow, you know, with some exceptions, which we'll get

09:00.000 --> 09:01.160
into even later in the show.

09:01.160 --> 09:08.420
But my point, in Old Vanilla WoW, a lot of the quests were fetch me animal pelts, kill

09:08.420 --> 09:09.760
X number of monsters.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.760
And they still have a lot of that.

09:10.760 --> 09:15.460
And there is a lot of that, but they've also mixed in a lot of more interesting technology

09:15.460 --> 09:18.240
from the newer expansions, like vehicle stuff from Rapid Listing.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.600
Use this item to scrape tar off this creature's ass.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.800
Yes, things like that.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.160
You know what I'm talking about too, don't you?

09:24.160 --> 09:27.000
Uh, no one, because I haven't done that quest, but did you get to dig through the poop for

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
the key?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
No.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
That quest I did.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I did see the one.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.560
Okay, now Tiara showed me this one.

09:32.560 --> 09:38.160
It was where you go to, um, oh crap, what's the, not the Outlands, but the place where

09:38.160 --> 09:39.160
everything's red.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.480
It has the big scar.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.480
Barrens?

09:42.480 --> 09:43.480
Badlands.

09:43.480 --> 09:44.480
Okay.

09:44.480 --> 09:45.480
Oh.

09:45.480 --> 09:49.280
And, because keep in mind, I'm still learning what everything's called, so.

09:49.280 --> 09:57.000
And um, and you run into a gnome, a dwarf, and uh, uh, something else.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.240
A pizza place?

09:58.240 --> 09:59.240
No.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.240
And they, no they don't.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.240
I see what you did there.

10:01.240 --> 10:05.400
And it's not a setup for a bad joke, but it's like, the dwarf is like, I went up to Death

10:05.400 --> 10:10.000
Winger and I punched him in the face!

10:10.000 --> 10:12.800
I was watching this video of this guy playing through it and he was doing all the voices

10:12.800 --> 10:16.680
and everything, and I was like, this is the funniest shit I've ever seen.

10:16.680 --> 10:20.880
And then the gnome was like, oh yeah, well I shrunk the world and looked for him in the

10:20.880 --> 10:24.800
clouds, and then I threw him on that other continent, so nah.

10:24.800 --> 10:29.200
And then the last one's like, I got on my motorcycle and picked up some hot babes, and

10:29.200 --> 10:30.360
we had a tender moment.

10:30.360 --> 10:33.520
Oh, that's the one where one of the hot babes is a blood elf male.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.520
Yeah.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.520
I remember that, yeah.

10:35.520 --> 10:36.520
Alright, I've seen that.

10:36.520 --> 10:37.520
Yeah.

10:37.520 --> 10:38.520
Good times.

10:38.520 --> 10:42.040
Um, but it was, it was just, but basically they were all telling tall tales and it was

10:42.040 --> 10:43.040
really funny.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.040
It was cute.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.880
What I like is that there's a lot more comedy thrown in there.

10:46.880 --> 10:52.240
It's like the quest to have the names that make me laugh my ass off.

10:52.240 --> 10:56.360
And I'm still pissed off at that stupid dragon for setting the world on fire and not setting

10:56.360 --> 10:58.040
me on fire.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.440
Stupid fucking dragon.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.040
You were, you were online with me for this.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.040
I was.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.360
And you're like, I'm standing in the fire and not dying.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.360
What is wrong?

11:05.360 --> 11:09.980
I took a screen capture of me in the fire not dying.

11:09.980 --> 11:12.160
I wanted the damn achievement.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.400
And then I got, I got achievements that you don't have.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.400
Whatever.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.400
Thanks to X-Link.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.400
No one, Ker.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.400
Alright.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.760
What else besides wow have you been playing?

11:19.760 --> 11:23.240
Well, also thank you for the thing that you sort of were in on.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.360
You're welcome.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.360
I got 800 gold.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.360
I'm gonna go buy me a bird.

11:27.360 --> 11:32.280
Um, no, I was playing other stuff, um, though it was really solitaire.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.280
And Mushihime Sama!

11:33.280 --> 11:36.240
Cause that game is crack.

11:36.240 --> 11:40.760
I tell you, Cave fans, if you want a little fun, uh, it's still bullet hell.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.000
It's just bullet hell with running.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.040
And like, you target stuff and then you let your things fall but you still have to avoid

11:47.040 --> 11:48.040
the bullet.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.040
It's, it's bullet hell.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.720
It's bullet hell on feet.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.160
Well hell.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.160
It's great.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.160
Alright.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.160
Loki, how was your gaming week?

11:55.160 --> 11:56.160
Um, it was okay.

11:56.160 --> 11:59.440
Um, I played a few different things this week.

11:59.440 --> 12:03.080
Um, I played The Flying Hamster, which is pretty awesome.

12:03.080 --> 12:09.040
It was a game that was a PSP mini at one point and I just brought it over to the iOS platform

12:09.040 --> 12:14.200
and it's a kind of a shooter game where you play a chibi flying hamster who has to save

12:14.200 --> 12:19.960
his hamster girlfriend or something like that and it's a shooter and it's really hard actually

12:19.960 --> 12:22.280
but it's all chibi and it's kind of cool.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.960
So I played that.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.760
And then, uh, more Sword and Poker 2.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.880
I'm actually almost done with that game.

12:28.880 --> 12:35.760
I'm in the last dungeon and I'm maybe six floors in, so that's pretty cool.

12:35.760 --> 12:39.040
Um, what else did I play?

12:39.040 --> 12:43.880
I think I played a little bit more, uh, Cannibalt, which is fun.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.600
Um, what else?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.320
Oh yeah.

12:48.320 --> 12:53.720
And then more Grand Theft Auto, but finally after working on it for six months we got

12:53.720 --> 12:59.840
our new modded games running again and I tell you that first game is the most fun I've had

12:59.840 --> 13:03.560
playing Grand Theft Auto in six months.

13:03.560 --> 13:10.720
It's just so incredibly different because the last, just the normal prank games that

13:10.720 --> 13:16.400
we play and stuff, I'm very concerned about winning and a lot of time my co-workers, I

13:16.400 --> 13:21.800
should say almost all the time, my co-workers aren't having as much fun as they could be

13:21.800 --> 13:24.680
having because I usually am kicking the crap out of them.

13:24.680 --> 13:30.900
Um, whereas the mod games, everybody has fun and it's just so over the top, like I was

13:30.900 --> 13:35.120
hysterically laughing throughout the whole game because just all this crazy shit was

13:35.120 --> 13:38.860
happening and it was just, it was awesome.

13:38.860 --> 13:42.000
So I'm looking forward to playing more of that.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.520
This time though we hot swapped all of our drives so we don't get banned, or so our consoles

13:48.520 --> 13:51.000
don't get banned this time.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.920
I'm pretty fast at it now, I can hot swap a console in about 15 minutes, it's like field

13:55.920 --> 13:57.920
stripping a gun or something.

13:57.920 --> 14:04.520
It's pretty quick, um, so yeah I played that and then um, actually looking forward to playing

14:04.520 --> 14:08.080
some new games soon, hopefully, well I'm going to pick up a little big planet.

14:08.080 --> 14:13.260
I have the collector's edition on order because I want those bookends and the little stuffed

14:13.260 --> 14:21.760
plush sack boy for my desk and then um, actually that's probably going to be the new thing

14:21.760 --> 14:22.760
I'm going to play for a while.

14:22.760 --> 14:27.660
I am going to actually finally update my console now that certain hacks have come out that

14:27.660 --> 14:33.360
allow custom firmwares and whatnot, so, on any firmware console, yeah.

14:33.360 --> 14:39.880
You want to get Linux on your good ol' PS3 again, huh?

14:39.880 --> 14:44.120
I don't really want even Linux and here's the thing is I had the opportunity to actually

14:44.120 --> 14:50.140
you know, mod my console to where I could pirate games on it, but I just didn't want

14:50.140 --> 14:55.480
to pirate games on the PS3 and that's saying something.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.280
And it's not a good something.

14:58.280 --> 15:02.440
Alright, uh, let's see, moving on to my gaming week.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.360
Sadly I don't have a lot of new new stuff to report.

15:05.360 --> 15:09.060
It's uh, I haven't had a lot of money to buy a lot of extra games lately so it's mostly

15:09.060 --> 15:13.560
the same stuff I was talking about last week with Fallout 3 and continuing on White Knight

15:13.560 --> 15:17.600
Chronicles a little more, although I have to admit the online stuff still doesn't make

15:17.600 --> 15:21.200
sense to me, but whatever, at least my internet is somewhat cooperating so I can keep a connection

15:21.200 --> 15:22.760
to PlayStation Network now.

15:22.760 --> 15:23.760
So that's nice.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.760
So I guess I'll dip in a little bit and talk about some iPhone games that I've checked

15:26.760 --> 15:29.440
out recently.

15:29.440 --> 15:33.040
One of them that I think you guys would like, and this was something that somebody had shouted

15:33.040 --> 15:37.560
out to me on Twitter and I so apologize because I forgot who sent this to me on Twitter, but

15:37.560 --> 15:43.300
it's a game called VGMC or Video Game Music Challenge and it's free on the App Store and

15:43.300 --> 15:49.880
all it is is it plays like theme songs from old school video games and you're given options

15:49.880 --> 15:53.160
on the screen and you have to guess what the song is.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.220
For example, want to play along guys?

15:55.220 --> 15:56.720
Let's see how well you guys do.

15:56.720 --> 16:00.600
So I'm in the menu of Video Game Music Challenge right now and let's see how well you guys

16:00.600 --> 16:01.600
do.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.600
Here's the first one.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.600
Ready?

16:03.600 --> 16:04.600
Anyone?

16:04.600 --> 16:05.600
Anyone know this one?

16:05.600 --> 16:06.600
This one's hard.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.600
I'm going to try Paperboy.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.600
Correct.

16:08.600 --> 16:23.320
Here's another one.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.320
Mario 3, right?

16:24.320 --> 16:25.320
Yeah.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.320
So that probably doesn't pick up on the speaker.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.240
It's all kind of middied.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.240
A little bit.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.240
Yeah.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.240
It's not like the original, original stuff, but it's all middied.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.240
But hey, it was free.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.240
So I think that's kind of cool.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.240
I did play that too.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.240
I forgot.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.240
Did you?

16:37.240 --> 16:38.240
Yes.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.240
Yeah.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.840
I played a little bit of Cut the Rope, the holiday edition, which is this really popular

16:42.840 --> 16:43.840
iPhone game.

16:43.840 --> 16:44.840
It's Cut the Rope.

16:44.840 --> 16:48.860
But I'm cheap and I like to have a lot of the free demos before I buy games and so they

16:48.860 --> 16:50.920
have this holiday edition that's free.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.760
And it's basically a puzzle game.

16:52.760 --> 16:56.400
But the cutest thing about it, and I think everyone would agree, would be the little

16:56.400 --> 17:01.360
monster character that you're trying to feed the candy to, Om Nom Nom, is adorable.

17:01.360 --> 17:05.000
And you have to like feed him the candy by choosing which ropes to cut.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.720
And it's kind of like a gravity physics puzzler type of thing.

17:09.720 --> 17:10.720
So it's fun.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.240
I like that.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.320
Tap Tap Revenge 4 is also out on the iTunes store.

17:15.320 --> 17:17.440
That's one of those like you tap along to songs.

17:17.440 --> 17:21.560
I'm going to admit, I used to like Tap Tap Revenge.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.840
I don't like it anymore.

17:22.840 --> 17:27.840
I think it really has become something, it's outgrown what it was.

17:27.840 --> 17:32.640
In the first couple versions it was cool, but now it's all commercialized and it's about

17:32.640 --> 17:33.640
selling the music.

17:33.640 --> 17:38.560
And the interface is impossible to navigate because they're trying to push all these add-on

17:38.560 --> 17:44.020
songs for money and it's like it's too hard to just get in there and like play a game.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.020
The interface is shit.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.060
I'm sorry, I don't have a nice way of saying it.

17:47.060 --> 17:52.840
Like they have just destroyed the game because they're trying too hard to build this music

17:52.840 --> 17:54.560
store around it.

17:54.560 --> 17:59.760
And I don't need all this, I don't really like all this other bullshit like Open Faint

17:59.760 --> 18:02.880
and I don't even like Game Center and some of this other stuff.

18:02.880 --> 18:06.280
Like I really wish there was just one for all of it.

18:06.280 --> 18:13.400
And to be honest, as much as I like Open Faint and what it's trying to do, we need one standard

18:13.400 --> 18:15.360
across all the iPhone games.

18:15.360 --> 18:20.680
And I think Apple ought to just step in and say, it's Game Center and get the fuck out.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.360
We're going to stop approving your apps if it has any other shit in it.

18:23.360 --> 18:26.760
Like I know that's like a terrible thing to say because Game Center is like the worst

18:26.760 --> 18:31.380
of all of them, but maybe they can work with the Open Faint people, I don't know.

18:31.380 --> 18:34.760
But I think it's ridiculous that you have like all these different games and they have

18:34.760 --> 18:35.760
all these different adults.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.760
They should just buy and absorb Open Faint.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.540
Or something, I don't know.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.880
So there's a lot of people that are going to really hate that I said that, but it's

18:40.880 --> 18:41.880
just annoying.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.680
I'm kind of, I kind of don't like either of them though.

18:43.680 --> 18:48.640
I hate all these freaking pop-ups when I start games, sign up for Open Faint, sign up for

18:48.640 --> 18:49.640
this network.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.640
Mine's like...

18:50.640 --> 18:51.640
No!

18:51.640 --> 18:54.040
I have an iPhone so I don't have to play with other people.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.040
You know?

18:55.040 --> 18:56.040
Yeah.

18:56.040 --> 18:57.040
So...

18:57.040 --> 19:00.720
Hey, let your friends on Twitter and Facebook know that you're playing an Open Faint game.

19:00.720 --> 19:04.280
I will post on Facebook if I want them to know I'm playing this game.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.080
Like, it's getting to be too much.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.840
I want a Facebook update every time I score a point.

19:09.840 --> 19:10.840
No.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.720
No, no, no.

19:12.720 --> 19:16.240
And then, believe it or not, I downloaded Smurf Village on the iPhone.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.720
It's stupid.

19:17.720 --> 19:18.720
It's a Facebook game.

19:18.720 --> 19:22.040
If you like those Facebook grindy games, then have fun.

19:22.040 --> 19:26.800
I prefer Knights of the Clicky on Facebook, which, by the way, I got Xtiver to play, or

19:26.800 --> 19:29.720
he played it, I don't know, because he heard one of us talking about it, and he said it

19:29.720 --> 19:33.100
was the worst thing he'd ever played in his life.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.100
Because Knights of the Crystal...

19:34.100 --> 19:35.880
There really is no point in Knights of the Crystal.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.720
It's Mafia Wars with Final Fantasy characters.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.240
I pretty much stopped playing it.

19:39.240 --> 19:45.040
I mean, I'm playing it some, like when I remember to, but when I was in Washington, I was like,

19:45.040 --> 19:48.480
I couldn't keep up with it on my laptop, so I was like, eh.

19:48.480 --> 19:52.320
Yeah, you kind of echo a lot of people that are kind of done with Knights of the Clicky.

19:52.320 --> 19:56.360
Like once you beat that final boss, you can kind of grind old quests and stuff, but there's

19:56.360 --> 19:57.800
not a lot else to do.

19:57.800 --> 20:02.320
Now they did just recently release, I can't believe I'm talking about a Facebook game.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.520
They released some new levels.

20:03.520 --> 20:10.440
We really do need an official Knights of the Clicky starring Clicky the Pen.

20:10.440 --> 20:15.520
A different show on the network owns the rights to that character, so we'll have to get agreements

20:15.520 --> 20:16.760
and contracts.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.320
You know, I haven't gotten to the last boss because I've actually been going through for

20:19.320 --> 20:23.440
Gold Mastery on other levels, and now I'm like, this is boring!

20:23.440 --> 20:25.440
What the crap am I doing?

20:25.440 --> 20:27.300
I'm done.

20:27.300 --> 20:30.040
Some comments in our chat room, some talk about Steam and Apple.

20:30.040 --> 20:34.080
William Murderface says, Apple needs to get in bed with Steam already.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.900
Act Def says Apple kind of already did that.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.920
That's when Portal came out for free.

20:37.920 --> 20:38.920
And that's true.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.920
Steam is on the Apple system now, so.

20:40.920 --> 20:45.320
Yeah, it's good for them, but I mean, no, Apple doesn't need to buy Steam.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.880
There was some other big news in the Apple world, and we'll talk about that because we

20:48.880 --> 20:50.680
have to, because it does affect video games.

20:50.680 --> 20:54.040
We're going to talk about that a little later on in the program, but we'll wait until we

20:54.040 --> 20:55.040
get there.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.720
So, I really don't have anything else to share with my gaming week.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.120
Not a lot of new console stuff, unfortunately.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.120
It's been a little slow.

21:02.120 --> 21:06.440
But hopefully as some of the new releases come out, I'll be picking them up and excited

21:06.440 --> 21:07.440
about that.

21:07.440 --> 21:11.480
I also really want to get LittleBigPlanet 2, so I think I'm going to have to do that.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.840
Anyhow, let's move on into some housekeeping tonight.

21:14.840 --> 21:20.400
No show stuff as far as I know, although I will say, it looks like we can kind of project

21:20.400 --> 21:26.120
now when episode number 400 will be, although we have yet to plan anything special for it.

21:26.120 --> 21:33.200
But if tonight is episode 396, then 397, 398, 399, episode number 400 of Orange Law and

21:33.200 --> 21:37.720
Trade Deal will be February 6th of this year, assuming we do not miss any shows between

21:37.720 --> 21:38.720
now and then.

21:38.720 --> 21:41.800
Or do not have a show at 399 and a half.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.920
So I don't know what's going to happen.

21:42.920 --> 21:47.080
I know we had talked a while about maybe doing it at a pizza parlor or something and trying

21:47.080 --> 21:48.640
to get some of the old crew together.

21:48.640 --> 21:53.680
I don't know if that's feasible, but we'll try to do something fun for episode 400.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.600
We're thinking about what we're going to do for that.

21:55.600 --> 21:59.960
So that's really the only thing, because I don't know if there's a lot of gaming podcasts

21:59.960 --> 22:02.160
that have hit episode 400 that are weekly.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.840
I'm sure some daily ones have, but I don't know about any other weekly shows.

22:05.840 --> 22:09.960
So if there are, I don't know of them, which would be a surprise at this point, because

22:09.960 --> 22:13.080
that means you have to be doing a show for at least eight, nine years like we have.

22:13.080 --> 22:17.600
So yeah, we'll be kind of doing something a little special for episode 400.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.120
We just don't know what yet.

22:19.120 --> 22:22.080
In good OLR fashion, we're procrastinating.

22:22.080 --> 22:27.560
Otherwise, you can join us on Facebook, porn, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.000
Or how about another marathon episode?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.760
You like those, right?

22:30.760 --> 22:35.600
Or twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.400
How about we get into some gaming news?

22:38.400 --> 22:40.560
Hokies, start us off tonight with some gaming news.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.560
Yes.

22:41.560 --> 22:47.440
So of course, there's some information, I mean, slightly before when the US announcement

22:47.440 --> 22:56.200
and stuff comes out on the 19th, but some stuff about the 3DS launch in Japan.

22:56.200 --> 23:02.440
They've announced 10 titles that are going to be expected for launch, I guess the Japanese

23:02.440 --> 23:05.440
launch date will be February 26th.

23:05.440 --> 23:13.780
And the titles you can expect, Winning Eleven 3DS, or 3D Soccer, get it, 3DS, Super Street

23:13.780 --> 23:25.720
Fighter 4 3D Edition, Samurai Warriors Chronicle, looks like, Tobi Dasu, Puzzle Bobble 3D, Nintendogs

23:25.720 --> 23:34.080
Plus Cats, wow, they're going to do 3 versions of that too, Toy Poodle and New Friends, French

23:34.080 --> 23:40.940
Bulldog and New Friends, and Shiba and New Friends, yes, I will not be stupid this time

23:40.940 --> 23:47.000
and buy all 3 versions, actually, I'll be smart this time and not buy any version, Ridge

23:47.000 --> 23:56.200
Racer 3D, I don't know, I kinda want the kitties, I want the kitties too, Ridge Racer 3D, Combat

23:56.200 --> 24:03.800
of Giants Dinosaur 3D, and Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle, so those are expected

24:03.800 --> 24:11.240
out, also it says there's supposed to be some new titles announced as well, including

24:11.240 --> 24:17.560
BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2, Imports of Tales of the Abyss, and Raving Rabbids Travel in

24:17.560 --> 24:26.760
Time, as well as the third game in the Tank Beat series, so those are going to be some

24:26.760 --> 24:31.880
launch titles, no real word on what the pricing is going to be over here yet, but in Japan

24:31.880 --> 24:45.720
it looks like they're kind of ranging around 4980 yen to say about 6090 yen, so between

24:45.720 --> 24:55.200
say $60 and $73 compared, well obviously it's a lot more expensive over there, I was going

24:55.200 --> 24:58.840
to say, they're not going to be $70 games, they're not going to be $70 games here, but

24:58.840 --> 25:04.040
they'll be more expensive than DS games won't they, they'll use the 3D thing as an excuse

25:04.040 --> 25:10.760
to charge a $10 premium, they will, I've already said before that one of the launch titles

25:10.760 --> 25:18.480
I've seen actually have an actual price to it is $40 retail, so it's not unheard of to

25:18.480 --> 25:25.480
have a $40 retail DS game, but it's rare, so usually those are the Squeenix games right,

25:25.480 --> 25:31.560
like the Final Fantasy remakes kind of got up there, sometimes, usually the cap they'll

25:31.560 --> 25:38.880
do on DS games is about $35 retail, but there have been like one or two $40 retail games,

25:38.880 --> 25:45.800
but I'm expecting probably a $10 increase, probably going to see everything from $40

25:45.800 --> 25:53.560
to a $50 as a high end game would be my guess, and then of course there's some more information

25:53.560 --> 25:59.160
regarding the battery life for the 3DS, they're saying that the 3DS has a 3 to 5 hour battery

25:59.160 --> 26:04.560
life for playing 3DS games, of course it's going to be a little bit longer if you're

26:04.560 --> 26:10.040
playing regular DS games, which is going to be 5 to 8 hours, and they're saying that's

26:10.040 --> 26:15.640
probably because it doesn't have to run the third display since the two displays are interlaced

26:15.640 --> 26:24.080
on the top screen, so that'll save a little bit of the battery, but either way, 5 to 8

26:24.080 --> 26:27.760
hours or 3 to 5 hours, that's not too bad.

26:27.760 --> 26:35.800
In comparison though, the DSi XL, they say that that lasts about 17 hours, so you may

26:35.800 --> 26:42.320
have to charge it a little bit more than you would your normal systems.

26:42.320 --> 26:46.200
So now that we know a little bit more about what the 3DS is going to be all about, I mean

26:46.200 --> 26:52.560
granted a lot of this news that came out this week from the event was Japan, but still we're

26:52.560 --> 26:53.560
kind of watching it here.

26:53.560 --> 26:59.320
Well, Samurai Warriors Chronicles is coming out here, that'll be the launch title here,

26:59.320 --> 27:05.560
Dead or Alive is going to be a launch title here, and Super Monkey Ball will be a launch

27:05.560 --> 27:06.560
title.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.720
So where's the hype at right now, because let me go to a comment in our chatroom at

27:09.720 --> 27:14.400
chat.orangelaunchrader.com, Defective Candy in our chatroom says, I love Nintendo, but

27:14.400 --> 27:17.080
I'm just not going to invest in a 3DS when it comes out.

27:17.080 --> 27:21.240
I'm going to wait until they release a second version just to make sure all the bugs are

27:21.240 --> 27:22.240
worked out.

27:22.240 --> 27:26.640
And I think that's a good question to ask, where's the hype meter now for the 3DS?

27:26.640 --> 27:30.600
Because are you guys interested in buying one now, or are you kind of where Defective

27:30.600 --> 27:35.440
Candy's at, where you're like, you know what, there is always inevitably the GBA with the

27:35.440 --> 27:39.840
backlight, the DS Lite, the second iteration of the handheld that comes out later.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.680
Yeah, but here's the thing with me, and the DS Lite and all that stuff, I didn't really

27:43.680 --> 27:45.680
care about the DS Lite.

27:45.680 --> 27:50.920
I guess the only iteration would be like the DSi, that was slightly different where they

27:50.920 --> 27:57.160
actually had like SD storage, and you know, the cameras on it and stuff like that.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.240
That's a little different.

27:59.240 --> 28:03.720
And I don't know if you'd even consider that like a different system almost, but it pretty

28:03.720 --> 28:05.960
much was.

28:05.960 --> 28:10.280
Sadly it won't ever be utilized, and remember they were going to be having DSi only games,

28:10.280 --> 28:13.320
and there was a handful of those, but they were kind of crap.

28:13.320 --> 28:16.840
A lot of them were crap, it was just unlock extra stuff that there's really no reason

28:16.840 --> 28:19.200
we shut out of the regular DS version.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.200
Exactly.

28:20.200 --> 28:29.800
So I don't know, I'm actually planning on getting one at launch, and really, you know,

28:29.800 --> 28:32.680
they haven't announced any launch titles yet, but I know one of the titles that they were

28:32.680 --> 28:38.840
working on that was supposed to be for the 3DS was the New Excite Truck Game, and I'm

28:38.840 --> 28:43.600
telling you, if they have a New Excite Truck Game at launch, I will not be able to resist.

28:43.600 --> 28:48.920
No, but I am planning on getting one at launch, and just because I don't really care about

28:48.920 --> 28:55.240
the reiterations that come out later on, unless they add major features to them, it doesn't

28:55.240 --> 29:01.040
really matter to me that they shrink down the size of the system, or they, you know,

29:01.040 --> 29:04.880
make the system bigger, and they have a different color.

29:04.880 --> 29:09.640
I don't care, because remember, those first systems are more exploitable than the other

29:09.640 --> 29:13.800
systems, so that's really what I care about.

29:13.800 --> 29:19.000
See here's where I'm at with the 3DS, like I am kind of with you skeptics, like it's

29:19.000 --> 29:23.520
inevitable that once you buy this, they're going to announce a new one next year.

29:23.520 --> 29:29.260
Like that is absolutely going to happen, it happens with every Apple product, it's a thing

29:29.260 --> 29:31.400
of technology.

29:31.400 --> 29:35.520
Here's and I'm really going to make myself sound like an a-hole by saying this, but here's

29:35.520 --> 29:38.760
where I'm coming from that a lot of you aren't coming from.

29:38.760 --> 29:43.760
I've seen the 3DS, and I've played the 3DS, and like I swear I'm not saying that to

29:43.760 --> 29:48.400
be a jerk, but I'm telling you, I'm saying that because when you see this technology

29:48.400 --> 29:55.720
for the first time, and you're like, I'm looking at 3D with no glasses, it kind of

29:55.720 --> 29:57.720
takes you back for a minute.

29:57.720 --> 30:01.520
And I think when they start putting these kiosks in stores and so forth, I think they're

30:01.520 --> 30:04.880
going to win a lot of people over, and I think there's going to be a lot of people that

30:04.880 --> 30:09.760
kind of put the, you know, oh well there'll be a new one next year aside, because they're

30:09.760 --> 30:11.360
going to want something like this now.

30:11.360 --> 30:14.560
Not just for the games, but for the things like the movies, and some of the other things

30:14.560 --> 30:17.600
that they're promising they're going to do, the cameras and so forth.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.200
I got to say, I really want one.

30:20.200 --> 30:24.120
Here's the thing too about the 3DS, is it's really kind of pushing some technology here

30:24.120 --> 30:25.560
that we don't see yet.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.640
Nintendo does this.

30:26.640 --> 30:32.080
They grasp new technology, and at the same time they don't embrace new technology sometimes.

30:32.080 --> 30:37.000
With the Wii, the whole motion control thing, that was really ahead of the game there.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.260
And then everybody was kind of playing catch up with that.

30:39.260 --> 30:43.320
But their network support, not quite where it is with everybody else.

30:43.320 --> 30:47.820
The 3DS, the technology's there, it's great that they're going to be doing all these cool

30:47.820 --> 30:49.080
things with it.

30:49.080 --> 30:56.140
I'm not so much of a fan of them re-releasing Nintendo 64 games supporting the 3DS.

30:56.140 --> 30:57.140
Come on!

30:57.140 --> 31:02.040
Seriously, you've been pulling this shit since the GameCube.

31:02.040 --> 31:06.240
It's just ridiculous to have these re-release games, but whatever.

31:06.240 --> 31:11.320
But here's the thing, is if this comes out and it's extremely popular, say they announce

31:11.320 --> 31:16.960
the PSP2, okay great, the PSP2's going to have some pretty cool hardware behind it,

31:16.960 --> 31:19.700
but what's it really going to do?

31:19.700 --> 31:23.420
Has a trackpad on it, ooh, ooh, touchpad.

31:23.420 --> 31:26.480
You're really catching up with everybody.

31:26.480 --> 31:30.440
Well I don't want to sound like a broken record on this show, but I always think the PSP's

31:30.440 --> 31:35.840
strength was not just as a gaming system, but as a comprehensive multimedia device.

31:35.840 --> 31:36.840
They're really kind of expanding.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.320
And that's what the 3DS doesn't have.

31:38.320 --> 31:43.040
I don't look at the 3DS going, I'm going to be able to browse the web in 3D, no I'm not.

31:43.040 --> 31:47.900
But they're saying though that, for example, they were talking at CES during their keynote

31:47.900 --> 31:52.680
that they're having Sony tablets, they're having, well they didn't really come out and

31:52.680 --> 31:55.880
say the PSP phone, but they're going to have the PSP phone.

31:55.880 --> 31:59.400
They're going to have the PSP2 probably at some point soon.

31:59.400 --> 32:05.240
So I don't think they really care too much, the fact that they can do all this stuff,

32:05.240 --> 32:08.640
because pretty much everything now is doing all that stuff.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.540
You can browse the web with any device almost.

32:11.540 --> 32:12.540
Except the DS.

32:12.540 --> 32:15.240
Uh huh, well I guess you can, and not very well.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.240
Just not well.

32:16.240 --> 32:19.680
Alright, let me go to the chatroom at chat.orangehelger.com, because there's some interesting discussion

32:19.680 --> 32:21.120
going on here that I want to bring up.

32:21.120 --> 32:25.420
Gamergirl kind of started the thing off by saying, I hate 3D, I can't watch that shit.

32:25.420 --> 32:33.060
And SolarFlare says, 3D is a fad, and CSCR, SMAT 454, sorry I don't know what the preferred

32:33.060 --> 32:35.480
name is there, wait for a price drop.

32:35.480 --> 32:36.480
Hmm.

32:36.480 --> 32:37.480
Well here's the thing.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.640
Can I say this real quick though?

32:39.640 --> 32:44.440
I also think, I'm getting a little sick of the whole 3Ds in the movie thing, because

32:44.440 --> 32:47.600
I think most movies don't benefit from it.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.600
Tron sure did.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.240
Yeah, but then I'm like, but Tron was actually really awesome in 3D.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.640
I thought Avatar was great in 3D.

32:53.640 --> 32:58.280
You know, and it's so difficult, like, I am, but I think there's too much, like Gulliver's

32:58.280 --> 33:03.560
Travel's 3D, no thanks, not gonna bother, do not want, but even something like Tangled

33:03.560 --> 33:04.560
was really cute.

33:04.560 --> 33:05.560
But here's the thing though.

33:05.560 --> 33:09.800
Gulliver's Travel is not a movie targeted at you Rob, it's targeted at little kids that

33:09.800 --> 33:10.800
like Jack White.

33:10.800 --> 33:14.200
Well it missed its target because it didn't do very well at the box office.

33:14.200 --> 33:20.360
Well that's the thing, it's a gamble, I mean that's something, Jack Black does not put

33:20.360 --> 33:28.000
people in the seats anymore, I don't know, but it's, speaking of which, I am gonna sneak

33:28.000 --> 33:36.120
out to the theaters to see Tron one last time, in D-Box, in D-Box, because Friday the 14th

33:36.120 --> 33:40.120
is the last day that they will have, actually no that will be the cutoff because they're

33:40.120 --> 33:48.560
gonna be getting a new D-Box movie which is, what the fuck is it, it's that Seth Rogen

33:48.560 --> 33:49.560
one.

33:49.560 --> 33:50.560
The Green Lantern.

33:50.560 --> 33:51.560
No, no, Green Hornet.

33:51.560 --> 33:52.560
Green Hornet, yeah.

33:52.560 --> 33:53.560
Green blank.

33:53.560 --> 33:54.560
The Green Hornet.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.800
Yes, I need to, I am sneaking out this week during, during, during.

33:57.800 --> 34:01.600
Okay, here's the thing I want to say though, because I am totally in that camp where I

34:01.600 --> 34:05.960
also think we're starting to get a little much with the 3D, and I was very skeptical

34:05.960 --> 34:09.680
going into the 3DS, but seeing that technology for the first time without the glasses was

34:09.680 --> 34:13.960
pretty amazing, and I have to admit my favorite part, and this is something the movies don't

34:13.960 --> 34:18.520
give you, my favorite part was that there's a little slider where you can adjust the intensity

34:18.520 --> 34:24.860
of the 3D, so it can be like, you know, kind of pulling on the eyes to, forget it, 2D.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.960
Just throw the 3D out and have 2D.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.720
So it's interesting to me that developers are gonna have to consider that, that some

34:29.720 --> 34:33.280
people are gonna want to play 3D, and someone to play 2D.

34:33.280 --> 34:38.440
The reason why I'm excited about the 3D, I want to see where it's gonna take games, because,

34:38.440 --> 34:44.400
you know, things like Doom, Quake, even things like Zelda, when they first came out, they

34:44.400 --> 34:47.040
were called 3D games.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.000
This whole virtual reality.

34:49.000 --> 34:54.040
And I think now that we have real 3D technology, I'm really curious to see where that's gonna

34:54.040 --> 34:56.940
take the gaming and interaction technology.

34:56.940 --> 34:57.940
That's where I'm at.

34:57.940 --> 34:58.940
Sorry, Loki, I cut you off like five minutes.

34:58.940 --> 35:02.400
Well, and then on the other thing is they don't have to necessarily use the 3DS top

35:02.400 --> 35:07.680
screen as a 3D screen, they can use it as an HD 2D screen because you have twice the

35:07.680 --> 35:10.160
resolution now to play around with.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.160
They don't have to actually interlace it to do 3D.

35:13.160 --> 35:18.400
So I think there's a lot of potential to do some really good-looking games, and the games

35:18.400 --> 35:19.520
on it look really good.

35:19.520 --> 35:24.520
I mean, like, the Dead or Live game looks like a console Dead or Live game, you know,

35:24.520 --> 35:29.760
Street Fighter IV looks like console Street Fighter IV, so it's not bad.

35:29.760 --> 35:32.460
And I think that's another point that a lot of people are forgetting is that we're all

35:32.460 --> 35:37.560
talking about 3D, yes, but in 2D, the graphics are better than they are on the DS.

35:37.560 --> 35:38.920
It is a graphical upgrade.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.600
It's not just a DS recycled.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.600
There is graphical and hardware upgrades with this thing.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.600
So.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.040
Well, we'll see.

35:47.040 --> 35:51.840
I mean, you know, I'm curious to know more details about what the US is getting.

35:51.840 --> 35:55.360
I was very surprised to hear that there is no pack-in at all.

35:55.360 --> 35:58.520
And we haven't heard what the new Mario game's gonna be.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.400
Can you imagine a new Mario game on this?

36:00.400 --> 36:01.760
That'll be sexy.

36:01.760 --> 36:07.080
I also do have to mention that for the people in the chat room who are pissing about, you

36:07.080 --> 36:10.840
know, 3D, if you don't like it, don't see it.

36:10.840 --> 36:15.800
Well, true, but, you know, I did ask the question, who's gonna buy this and who's not, and so

36:15.800 --> 36:16.800
if they're not, that's fine.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.880
Well, but I'm saying, you know, for the people who are just saying 3D is overdone, 3D is

36:19.880 --> 36:23.960
overdone, if you don't like it, fine, don't ruin it for the people that like it.

36:23.960 --> 36:27.400
I don't, you know, that's this thing.

36:27.400 --> 36:30.960
If you don't want your games in 3D, don't buy a 3DS.

36:30.960 --> 36:35.240
If you don't want your movies in 3D, don't go see them in 3D.

36:35.240 --> 36:38.740
If you don't want to watch TV in 3D, don't get a 3D TV.

36:38.740 --> 36:39.840
It's that easy.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.640
Stop bitching.

36:41.640 --> 36:46.640
But maybe there's this worry, and I think it's a valid concern, that 3D is slowly becoming

36:46.640 --> 36:47.840
the norm.

36:47.840 --> 36:48.840
You know?

36:48.840 --> 36:49.840
It is gonna become the norm.

36:49.840 --> 36:50.840
Consumer electronics show.

36:50.840 --> 36:54.140
We don't, we didn't hear about any 2D TVs.

36:54.140 --> 36:58.880
Maybe the one, we heard about like one 2D TV because it was like a gigantic wall-sized

36:58.880 --> 37:01.640
television, like, I mean, wall-sized television.

37:01.640 --> 37:06.640
But otherwise, everybody's talking about 3D, 3D, 3D TVs, 3D TVs without glasses, 3D.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.000
3D's not going anywhere.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.400
It's gonna be around, you know, for a while, and it will become the norm, and people will

37:11.400 --> 37:12.480
just stop bitching about it.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.480
It's not a fad.

37:13.480 --> 37:16.760
But yes, here, just like- So I can see where people are concerned about

37:16.760 --> 37:17.760
that.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.960
But just like any emerging technology, just like with, you know, the Wii and stuff like

37:20.960 --> 37:25.760
that, the first, you know, the first games you have on the Wii or whatever are gonna

37:25.760 --> 37:30.880
be really cheesy, and they're gonna be just some cheap ideas to utilize the technology.

37:30.880 --> 37:35.240
Just like the first 3D movies, you know, there's a couple good ones, and a lot of them were

37:35.240 --> 37:40.080
just tacked on 3D to get people in the seats because it's a 3D movie.

37:40.080 --> 37:43.480
But a lot of stuff now, a lot of movies are being filmed in 3D.

37:43.480 --> 37:49.240
Granted, you're not gonna see, you know, I don't know, Sister of the Traveling Pants

37:49.240 --> 37:50.240
3 in 3D.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.680
God, let's hope not.

37:51.680 --> 37:56.680
You know, but I think eventually everything will be in 3D, and that's just gonna be the

37:56.680 --> 37:57.680
way it is.

37:57.680 --> 38:01.520
You know, and when your kids, you know, you're talking to your kids about how you used to

38:01.520 --> 38:04.360
see the 2D movies, they're like, 2D?

38:04.360 --> 38:06.080
What are you talking about?

38:06.080 --> 38:07.080
What is 2D?

38:07.080 --> 38:10.280
And that's the time when the 4D dimension will be coming out, and you can watch movies

38:10.280 --> 38:12.460
in an alternate time.

38:12.460 --> 38:18.320
This is my issue, is that people bitched about TV when it was new.

38:18.320 --> 38:21.640
People bitched about HDTV.

38:21.640 --> 38:24.480
People bitched when it was time to go from 8-track to cassette.

38:24.480 --> 38:27.040
Or VHS to DVD.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.040
Exactly.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.200
It's the same thing over and over.

38:31.200 --> 38:34.160
And it's just sort of like a big inevitability.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.880
Technology is going to progress.

38:36.880 --> 38:39.280
I gotta play devil's advocate.

38:39.280 --> 38:44.240
None of those technologies hurt my eyes.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.280
That's the one downside I can see to this 3D.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.280
Yeah.

38:47.280 --> 38:50.720
Like, even when I go to do the 3D movies and so forth, like, I can't wear the glasses for

38:50.720 --> 38:51.720
the whole two hours consecutively.

38:51.720 --> 38:52.720
Yeah, but you know why, though?

38:52.720 --> 38:56.280
That's because the technology that they have right now, there's a lot of flicker and just

38:56.280 --> 38:57.900
they're gonna catch up.

38:57.900 --> 39:01.120
It's the technology will get better and it'll be less harsh on your eyes.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.120
Okay, that's fair.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.120
Well, think about this.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.720
Alright, look at televisions in the 80s.

39:05.720 --> 39:06.720
Okay.

39:06.720 --> 39:11.040
Remember those big, you know, cabinet televisions that would have that, you know, look like,

39:11.040 --> 39:13.240
oh, there's supposed to be nice furniture and shit.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.200
Really blurry screen quality.

39:15.200 --> 39:21.840
Now we've got TVs that are three times those size in perfect crystal clear HD quality.

39:21.840 --> 39:25.200
And we're talking about a span of 25 years.

39:25.200 --> 39:29.280
So by the time I'm 50, the holodeck should be out, right?

39:29.280 --> 39:31.660
No, I'm not saying that.

39:31.660 --> 39:32.660
But now also...

39:32.660 --> 39:33.660
Holodeck retirement.

39:33.660 --> 39:38.680
But now, but if you think about it too, the growth of technology is also exponential,

39:38.680 --> 39:47.040
you know, as the more technological advancement you get in the different fields, they're gonna

39:47.040 --> 39:49.140
speed up the new rate of research.

39:49.140 --> 39:51.240
The more you learn, the more you're gonna learn.

39:51.240 --> 39:52.560
That's how I see it.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.160
Two very interesting comments in chat.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.160
I gotta bring up.

39:55.160 --> 39:59.680
Bochi Kawa in our chat room says, besides, we're still playing games on the NES.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.120
If you want new, then get new.

40:01.120 --> 40:03.000
If you want old, play old.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Interesting.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Seriously.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
And that's what we do.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.960
We've got a whole room full of old.

40:07.960 --> 40:11.240
And it's not to say that all technologies end up, you know, taking off.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.240
Old is new.

40:12.240 --> 40:15.520
Look at how much retro crap gets repackaged and comes out.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.520
You know what I mean?

40:16.520 --> 40:19.000
That's because all the kids have grown up and are making the games.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Fascinating.

40:20.000 --> 40:27.800
Steve, and I don't know if this is our show or not, but can you believe that copies of

40:27.800 --> 40:34.400
Super Mario All-Stars, the reprint that was on the Wii, are selling for $75 and $80 on

40:34.400 --> 40:35.400
eBay?

40:35.400 --> 40:36.400
Yeah.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.700
Are you people fucking nuts?

40:38.700 --> 40:41.240
Let me bring this up in chat as well, because this is another good comment.

40:41.240 --> 40:43.680
And then I promise we can change the topic.

40:43.680 --> 40:48.060
Mayor in our chat room says, why now versus the last 3D?

40:48.060 --> 40:51.000
And I think that's a very legitimate question.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.160
And I'm guessing a lot of it has to do with the technology.

40:53.160 --> 41:00.120
Like, you know, the last time 3D was big was the mid early 80s when like Jaws 3D was out

41:00.120 --> 41:01.400
and that stuff.

41:01.400 --> 41:05.800
And I'm thinking there's two reasons for it.

41:05.800 --> 41:09.240
A, that technology wasn't as good, period.

41:09.240 --> 41:13.760
I mean, when you're talking to 3DS, again, I'm telling you guys, the first time you see

41:13.760 --> 41:17.680
it without glasses, you do have that moment of, whoa, everybody's going to have that moment

41:17.680 --> 41:22.380
of whoa, I'm playing this and I'm not wearing glasses and I'm seeing the 3D.

41:22.380 --> 41:26.680
And then B, Jaws 3D was not Avatar.

41:26.680 --> 41:32.020
And love Avatar or hate it, the fact is it's the highest grossing movie ever.

41:32.020 --> 41:34.600
And now everybody wants to be it.

41:34.600 --> 41:38.560
So I think those are the two big differences to me is that, you know, technology has come

41:38.560 --> 41:44.460
a long way and a movie got to be extremely successful with the technology.

41:44.460 --> 41:48.840
And let me tell you that Avatar didn't make its money because people liked the plot.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.440
They wanted to see the pretty 3D.

41:50.440 --> 41:56.760
Well, but if you also look into the actual technology that went into it, it's basically

41:56.760 --> 42:00.920
in, you know, I think that they applied some of it to a lesser extent in Tron, remember,

42:00.920 --> 42:06.400
with the having the 3D modeled younger face, even though he looked like, you know, plastic.

42:06.400 --> 42:10.080
That technology still needs, still needs some work.

42:10.080 --> 42:15.160
But I think I think what they needed was better animation.

42:15.160 --> 42:17.640
That's what I think that that needed.

42:17.640 --> 42:23.560
But if you stop and look at it, you're going to basically be replacing.

42:23.560 --> 42:27.800
I mean, now, keep in mind, we were having this conversation like a while back, me and

42:27.800 --> 42:32.680
Dan were, about how we miss, you know, matte paintings and, you know, things in movies

42:32.680 --> 42:35.920
use like, for example, OK, I'll use Tron since I was already on it.

42:35.920 --> 42:39.800
In the first Tron movie, when he walks into the cubicle area and there's cubicles going

42:39.800 --> 42:42.840
on for miles, that was all matte painting.

42:42.840 --> 42:51.400
You know, or remember V when they walked into the ship and it's, you know, the whole lines

42:51.400 --> 42:54.880
of the storage pods going on in the back and the old one.

42:54.880 --> 42:56.160
That was all matte painting.

42:56.160 --> 42:59.520
My favorite was always rear projection for driving scenes.

42:59.520 --> 43:00.520
Yeah.

43:00.520 --> 43:07.200
But now, but now if you look at that, you're going to, I don't think that the craftsmanship

43:07.200 --> 43:08.520
is going anywhere.

43:08.520 --> 43:11.880
It's just moving to a different medium.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.400
You're still going to have to have animators.

43:13.400 --> 43:16.680
You're still going to have to have artists that are going to be able to make all of this.

43:16.680 --> 43:21.480
And yeah, maybe you're saving in resources in paint and that type of thing.

43:21.480 --> 43:24.720
And keep in mind, I still think nothing will replace painting.

43:24.720 --> 43:27.160
Nothing will replace physical art.

43:27.160 --> 43:28.160
You know what I mean?

43:28.160 --> 43:33.760
But at the same time, I think that if you're looking in terms of pushing the envelope as

43:33.760 --> 43:39.920
far as the experience that you can deliver in technology, in a cinematic experience or

43:39.920 --> 43:45.360
in games or movies, anything like that, that you're going to have to start making situations

43:45.360 --> 43:47.320
where it's cheaper to produce.

43:47.320 --> 43:52.280
And I think that that's going to be the advantage of going with the same type of innovations

43:52.280 --> 43:53.280
that they made with Avatar.

43:53.280 --> 43:59.320
That's what my point was, is the fact that you could have warehouses and then send it

43:59.320 --> 44:06.680
off to a team of animators and have this high quality product produced with some time and

44:06.680 --> 44:09.820
effort, but you're not paying for a set.

44:09.820 --> 44:14.480
You're not paying for makeup, you know, none of that.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.480
That was my point.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.480
Okay.

44:16.480 --> 44:17.480
Okay.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.840
That's where I see everything going with the technology developed with that.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.980
You know, yeah, cool movie.

44:21.980 --> 44:25.800
But I think that they need to take the same things that, you know, they can even do, keep

44:25.800 --> 44:28.040
in mind, they can even do the same thing with video games.

44:28.040 --> 44:32.880
You know, we've had motion capture in video games before, so keep in mind taking that

44:32.880 --> 44:37.560
same sort of, you know, the blank set.

44:37.560 --> 44:43.520
You can actually do all of your cinematic cut scenes with like actual actors and record

44:43.520 --> 44:48.440
them real time, have them, you know, the layers and everything, but over it for a game and

44:48.440 --> 44:50.800
boom, there you go.

44:50.800 --> 44:53.280
Let me try to wrap up this topic by going back to one of the thought.

44:53.280 --> 44:57.240
No, because it relates to what you just said about motion capture and stuff and a lot of

44:57.240 --> 45:00.200
the other technology that's been coming out in the past few months has to do with that

45:00.200 --> 45:06.120
when you talk about Kinect is basically kind of like a live motion capture type of thing.

45:06.120 --> 45:09.440
Going back to the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are

45:09.440 --> 45:10.440
on it.

45:10.440 --> 45:13.600
And I think that's very important to remember with this whole 3DS launch as well is that

45:13.600 --> 45:19.000
if the games are poop, you know, the pretty will wear off quickly.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.220
I am really curious about this year's E3.

45:22.220 --> 45:27.700
I am so, like I have to admit, like the hype going into this year's E3 is almost higher

45:27.700 --> 45:32.600
than it's ever been because I think this is a very crucial E3.

45:32.600 --> 45:38.160
I think it's either going to be the best show ever or it's going to be a stinker.

45:38.160 --> 45:40.200
And I mean, easy to say, right?

45:40.200 --> 45:45.760
But the reason why is because now you have this technology, you have Kinect, you have

45:45.760 --> 45:52.840
Move, you have soon to be this PSP2, and you have the 3DS and, you know, all these launch

45:52.840 --> 45:56.460
games are kind of like that obvious thing to do the technology.

45:56.460 --> 46:01.960
All the Kinect launch games were essentially Wii knockoffs and Dance Central.

46:01.960 --> 46:07.600
You know, all the 3DS things are these Nintendo upgrades and sort of like, you know, finally

46:07.600 --> 46:10.120
Kid Icarus coming back and so forth.

46:10.120 --> 46:13.280
I'm really curious now what is going to be next.

46:13.280 --> 46:19.120
Now that these technologies are established, how are you going to take it to the next level?

46:19.120 --> 46:24.120
What is that must-have game going to have in it that implements that technology that

46:24.120 --> 46:26.360
just blows us away?

46:26.360 --> 46:30.800
So I'm really interested in what's going to be brought to the table this year at E3.

46:30.800 --> 46:34.000
And it's either going to be great or it's going to show that, you know what, we should

46:34.000 --> 46:38.040
have never left where we were last year.

46:38.040 --> 46:44.000
The whole 12 months have been a lie, and this whole crap is just a fad.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Very curious.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.960
Anyhow, let's move on with some more topics.

46:46.960 --> 46:48.960
Good discussion, but we've got plenty more to get through tonight.

46:48.960 --> 46:49.960
So Dark Sakura.

46:49.960 --> 46:55.360
Well, how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with 3D visuals except maybe

46:55.360 --> 46:56.360
being rendered?

46:56.360 --> 46:58.920
Lord of the Rings Online.

46:58.920 --> 47:01.280
It's making a lot of money now.

47:01.280 --> 47:04.320
Since they went free to play, and you know how we kind of left, oh, they must be sucking,

47:04.320 --> 47:05.800
they're going free to play.

47:05.800 --> 47:13.160
Actually, they're making three times as much revenue monthly, so that's pretty cool.

47:13.160 --> 47:19.300
They are now doing the whole, I hate the word term, microtransaction, because a transaction

47:19.300 --> 47:27.480
is a transaction, fuck putting a size on it, but they're using this little, you know, and

47:27.480 --> 47:32.160
I can see doing it, I've been doing some of them in Star Trek Online when I was playing.

47:32.160 --> 47:37.120
I bought outfits and ship packs and stuff, even with my subscription fee.

47:37.120 --> 47:43.560
So I can see that if someone wants to make a character look a certain way, they're going

47:43.560 --> 47:46.800
to spend all the little bits and pieces and not even see that they're nickel diming their

47:46.800 --> 47:50.000
money right into their pocket.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.800
And I've always said the minute this technology comes out for World of Warcraft, Horde House

47:53.800 --> 47:55.960
is over, I'm quitting WoW.

47:55.960 --> 47:59.760
The minute this type of stuff, and you might already say, oh Rob, you can already do it,

47:59.760 --> 48:04.560
the mounts are da da da da, that's all superficial crap, and you know, it does not affect the

48:04.560 --> 48:05.560
base game.

48:05.560 --> 48:06.560
When this becomes their model.

48:06.560 --> 48:07.560
Exactly.

48:07.560 --> 48:11.400
If Warcraft ever implements this stuff where the stats, you know, change or you're getting

48:11.400 --> 48:16.320
things that otherwise you grind dungeons for or whatever, Horde House is canceled and WoW

48:16.320 --> 48:23.520
is done, as far as I'm concerned, because that's not, I like playing a game where everybody's

48:23.520 --> 48:26.080
on an equal playing field.

48:26.080 --> 48:30.480
Everybody's paying 15 bucks a month, everybody, you know, is on that same playing field when

48:30.480 --> 48:35.240
it comes to the quest that you're grinding and so forth, and those that get the super

48:35.240 --> 48:37.680
awesome items really worked for it.

48:37.680 --> 48:45.240
However, that's not to slam this other idea, because, you know, not everything can be WoW,

48:45.240 --> 48:49.740
and not everything can kind of command the $15 up front, and I think we've seen a lot

48:49.740 --> 48:55.700
of the same model, oddly enough, in Facebook games, and it's worked really well.

48:55.700 --> 48:59.880
You know, and I don't know, these games, I'm okay with the way they do it, because it's

48:59.880 --> 49:03.560
sort of like, well you know nothing in this world is really free.

49:03.560 --> 49:07.200
So that's how they choose to nickel and dime you instead of the cost of the game.

49:07.200 --> 49:11.560
And so, I don't know, for some reason, I'm okay with it, but at the same time, I can't

49:11.560 --> 49:17.640
think of any free to play games that I really play with any regularity, except one or two

49:17.640 --> 49:19.300
Facebook games.

49:19.300 --> 49:23.400
That even then, if they were to disappear and delete tomorrow, I wouldn't lose any sleep

49:23.400 --> 49:24.400
over it.

49:24.400 --> 49:28.240
Well, you keep in mind, too, that a lot of, like, remember when I was playing Ragnarok

49:28.240 --> 49:29.240
Online?

49:29.240 --> 49:32.640
A lot of the free servers that I would play on, they would actually make the money to

49:32.640 --> 49:38.840
run the servers by offering special items for people who donated.

49:38.840 --> 49:43.120
And that's been going on for years.

49:43.120 --> 49:44.960
Second Life, that's how they run.

49:44.960 --> 49:50.480
You know, you pay real money for stuff that people have made, and that's how you do your

49:50.480 --> 49:52.080
thing there.

49:52.080 --> 49:57.120
I think that it's just now they're saying that, you know, when you don't notice how

49:57.120 --> 50:03.400
much you're spending, that it's easier to spend a lot more, if that makes sense.

50:03.400 --> 50:04.400
Absolutely.

50:04.400 --> 50:07.000
That's gambling, is a lot of that.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.280
And on top of that, you're not dealing with actual physical money.

50:10.280 --> 50:13.560
You're dealing with a click, yes.

50:13.560 --> 50:18.440
There's no money leaving your hand, but it's relieving your bank account, so.

50:18.440 --> 50:19.440
It could be dangerous.

50:19.440 --> 50:22.440
When Xbox Live first came out, I bought every single arcade game that came out.

50:22.440 --> 50:23.440
Freakin' iTunes.

50:23.440 --> 50:26.240
Yeah, iTunes is easy to fall into that too.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.240
Same thing.

50:27.240 --> 50:28.240
Oh yeah.

50:28.240 --> 50:30.240
So, anyway.

50:30.240 --> 50:31.920
Good talks tonight!

50:31.920 --> 50:32.920
Speaking of Xbox Live-

50:32.920 --> 50:35.400
Keep a ledger by your desk when you play.

50:35.400 --> 50:36.400
For real.

50:36.400 --> 50:39.360
Alright, Loki, what's up next in the news for us?

50:39.360 --> 50:40.360
Alright.

50:40.360 --> 50:41.360
Oops.

50:41.360 --> 50:42.360
Anyways.

50:42.360 --> 50:48.520
This is kinda cool, they're doing a new promotion, it's kinda something that they've been doing

50:48.520 --> 50:51.120
each year for Xbox Live Arcade.

50:51.120 --> 50:52.120
The House Party.

50:52.120 --> 50:56.880
Well, this time they've got a lineup of games coming out that's actually pretty cool.

50:56.880 --> 51:02.320
There's gonna be five games that will start coming out on February 18th, each week.

51:02.320 --> 51:04.600
And it's gonna include the following titles.

51:04.600 --> 51:12.960
Beyond Good and Evil HD, Hardcore Uprising, that's that Contra game that's kinda anime

51:12.960 --> 51:13.960
style now.

51:13.960 --> 51:20.480
Bejeweled Blitz Live, Full House Poker, which is supposed to be that game that's kind of

51:20.480 --> 51:26.920
the next evolution of the, what do they call that, the 1 vs 100 type thing, but now with

51:26.920 --> 51:27.920
poker.

51:27.920 --> 51:31.680
And then of course, Torchlight is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade as well.

51:31.680 --> 51:36.600
So that's a pretty good lineup of titles right there.

51:36.600 --> 51:45.880
And no word on pricing for that yet, but those are gonna be each week, so that's pretty exciting.

51:45.880 --> 51:50.520
I am so excited about Torchlight coming.

51:50.520 --> 51:51.520
It's gonna be sweet.

51:51.520 --> 51:56.480
But it's gonna be weird, because Torchlight is very PC.

51:56.480 --> 51:57.480
You know what I mean?

51:57.480 --> 52:02.040
And if you've never played it, it's basically Diablo 2.

52:02.040 --> 52:04.020
I don't know how else to explain it.

52:04.020 --> 52:09.840
It's a lot of that same kind of like dungeon crawl, and lots of keys do different things.

52:09.840 --> 52:13.040
And I think they've talked about with this coming to Xbox Live Arcade, they've practically

52:13.040 --> 52:17.720
revamped the whole battle system, because you kinda have to click a lot.

52:17.720 --> 52:20.240
You have to use a mouse to play Torchlight.

52:20.240 --> 52:24.480
So going from that to controller is gonna be really weird.

52:24.480 --> 52:26.840
It's not even gonna be the same game.

52:26.840 --> 52:30.600
So it's almost strange to me that they're calling it Torchlight still.

52:30.600 --> 52:34.240
It's almost like Torchlight Side Quest or Side Story.

52:34.240 --> 52:38.500
I guess I don't really know until I get my hands on it how different it's gonna be, but

52:38.500 --> 52:44.920
just at the base with changing all these controls is gonna be really interesting.

52:44.920 --> 52:48.880
But at the same time, they're gonna kinda trick me into buying the same game twice,

52:48.880 --> 52:51.600
because I have it on PC and now I kinda want it on Xbox Live Arcade.

52:51.600 --> 52:52.600
Damn it!

52:52.600 --> 52:53.600
Damn it!

52:53.600 --> 52:54.600
Exactly.

52:54.600 --> 52:55.600
I've been tricked into buying this game twice.

52:55.600 --> 52:57.160
What about you, chatters?

52:57.160 --> 53:01.240
Many of you guys play Torchlight on your PC, and yet you think you're gonna buy this on

53:01.240 --> 53:04.000
Xbox Live Arcade as well?

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
So I'm curious about...

53:05.000 --> 53:08.600
What were some of the other games that were coming out?

53:08.600 --> 53:10.640
It's all Torchlight Torchlight to me.

53:10.640 --> 53:14.680
But Joel Blitz Live, they have that...

53:14.680 --> 53:16.280
That game's free to play on Facebook.

53:16.280 --> 53:18.480
They're gonna charge me to play it on Xbox Live?

53:18.480 --> 53:19.480
Yeah.

53:19.480 --> 53:20.480
Bastards.

53:20.480 --> 53:21.480
Beyond Good and Evil HD.

53:21.480 --> 53:24.000
I know a lot of people are Beyond Good and Evil fans.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Yeah, that'll be a big one.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.320
What else?

53:27.320 --> 53:30.520
Oh, there's that new poker game that was from Microsoft.

53:30.520 --> 53:35.360
Oh, that's the 1 versus 100 replacement, isn't it?

53:35.360 --> 53:36.360
Yes.

53:36.360 --> 53:39.200
Bochikawa in our chatroom says Torchlight with Kinect support?

53:39.200 --> 53:40.680
That might be really fun.

53:40.680 --> 53:42.840
I don't think it uses Kinect.

53:42.840 --> 53:43.840
I don't think so either.

53:43.840 --> 53:46.360
That's an interesting thought, though, is that what if instead of a mouse, it was your

53:46.360 --> 53:47.360
hand?

53:47.360 --> 53:51.780
And you could just move your hand around and click by, like, just thrusting your hand forward

53:51.780 --> 53:52.780
or something?

53:52.780 --> 53:53.780
I don't know.

53:53.780 --> 53:54.780
It'd be interesting.

53:54.780 --> 53:57.720
Did Suya remind us that Diablo was on the PlayStation?

53:57.720 --> 53:58.960
Look at how Diablo worked on the PlayStation.

53:58.960 --> 54:01.160
They just changed the controls to work with the controller.

54:01.160 --> 54:04.480
I totally forgot that Diablo had been on the PlayStation.

54:04.480 --> 54:07.000
I think I did play it on the PlayStation, too.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
All right.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.440
Well, anyhow, moving on to another story while some more comments come in.

54:11.440 --> 54:12.440
This is one of those stories.

54:12.440 --> 54:16.160
I just want to hurry up and get through this and forget about it because it's another one

54:16.160 --> 54:21.880
of these, like, crazy obscure patent guy comes out and decides to sue reputable companies

54:21.880 --> 54:25.760
in a court of law because everybody in this country is too happy.

54:25.760 --> 54:28.160
And who's getting sued this time?

54:28.160 --> 54:32.880
Activision Blizzard and Zynga.

54:32.880 --> 54:36.900
And I can't, like, what do these two companies possibly have in common where they're both

54:36.900 --> 54:37.900
being sued?

54:37.900 --> 54:44.480
Well, Walker Digital, which was founded by Jay Walker, who also made Priceline.com, is

54:44.480 --> 54:45.480
behind this suit.

54:45.480 --> 54:47.060
So maybe it's not just any old troll.

54:47.060 --> 54:49.720
This is a troll with a big website.

54:49.720 --> 54:56.800
Zynga and Activision violate the patent, which is a database-driven online distributed

54:56.800 --> 54:59.920
tournament system.

54:59.920 --> 55:06.000
Walker is saying that the part of this that has been violated is the part of the patent

55:06.000 --> 55:11.200
that says there is a, quote, method of conducting a distributed electronic tournament for a

55:11.200 --> 55:14.160
plurality of players.

55:14.160 --> 55:19.640
And World of Warcraft Call of Duty Black Ops, which is Activision, which is part of Blizzard

55:19.640 --> 55:25.680
Card, Mafia Wars, and all these games have these tournaments in them.

55:25.680 --> 55:28.760
Kind of odd that Starcraft isn't mentioned, because when I think tournaments, I don't

55:28.760 --> 55:32.360
think, wow, I think Starcraft, but whatever.

55:32.360 --> 55:34.600
I guess violates this patent.

55:34.600 --> 55:39.880
I don't know, I'm starting to think with all these stories I read that patent stuff is

55:39.880 --> 55:41.480
a need for reform, or-

55:41.480 --> 55:44.280
I think whatever judge reviews that needs to just tell him to bite his ass.

55:44.280 --> 55:47.520
Well, and it probably will get laughed out of court, as a lot of these recent ones have,

55:47.520 --> 55:49.800
but they're asking for a full trial or whatever.

55:49.800 --> 55:50.800
And you know what?

55:50.800 --> 55:53.760
If this guy had the technology years ago or whatever, that's fine.

55:53.760 --> 55:57.440
If you were the one that thought of it, I guess, although I somehow don't think these

55:57.440 --> 56:00.440
companies have implemented it quite the same way.

56:00.440 --> 56:04.600
And just the fact that, why do you patent something and then do nothing with it?

56:04.600 --> 56:07.120
Like that's what bothers.

56:07.120 --> 56:10.240
That's what makes you look like a troll, is you're just waiting for someone to actually

56:10.240 --> 56:14.680
put a good idea to use, and then it gets to the pants off of them.

56:14.680 --> 56:15.680
I don't know.

56:15.680 --> 56:20.640
A little silly to me, and I'm sure it's a little silly to all of you as well.

56:20.640 --> 56:23.440
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?

56:23.440 --> 56:26.440
Oh, I've got a few other things.

56:26.440 --> 56:28.440
How about Mario All-Stars?

56:28.440 --> 56:35.120
Well, it's sold out, and copies are going for 80 bucks on eBay, and they're talking

56:35.120 --> 56:37.120
about more reprints.

56:37.120 --> 56:41.220
So we might be seeing it going, however, they have not sold out in the UK.

56:41.220 --> 56:47.440
And you can still get your copy on Amazon UK for $17.99.

56:47.440 --> 56:50.960
So people in Europe, stockpile!

56:50.960 --> 56:52.800
Because we're coming after your supply.

56:52.800 --> 56:56.760
And people here in the US, you're gonna be really sorry buying these for $80 on eBay

56:56.760 --> 56:58.920
if they end up reprinting them, which they probably will.

56:58.920 --> 57:08.200
Well yeah, I mean, basically, Mark Franklin, who's the head of Nintendo PR, said that they're

57:08.200 --> 57:12.960
thinking about bringing it back in reprints.

57:12.960 --> 57:16.040
So they definitely want to make more money, and people will buy them.

57:16.040 --> 57:17.900
The market's there.

57:17.900 --> 57:22.120
And I'm sure there's gotta be a lot of us sitting here going, who is buying this?

57:22.120 --> 57:27.440
Because seriously, it's a port of a game that was out on the SNES, I mean.

57:27.440 --> 57:32.520
Well here's this, Dan turned to me a while back and said, hey, you want this game?

57:32.520 --> 57:33.520
Why?

57:33.520 --> 57:34.520
We've got it on the SNES.

57:34.520 --> 57:38.680
I mean, I think we were talking about wanting the special edition or something because it

57:38.680 --> 57:41.360
came with shit, but why?

57:41.360 --> 57:43.120
I'll tell you who's buying this.

57:43.120 --> 57:46.120
Most people out there in the world aren't like you and Dan.

57:46.120 --> 57:51.220
There's a lot of folks that, you know, are having families now that when they were teenagers

57:51.220 --> 57:54.860
were playing the Super Nintendo and remember this game on the Super Nintendo.

57:54.860 --> 57:56.080
It's soccer moms!

57:56.080 --> 57:59.660
It's the same people that are driving the sales of the Wii in the first place.

57:59.660 --> 58:02.280
Soccer moms are buying the Mario games because they remember playing it when they were younger.

58:02.280 --> 58:07.160
I guarantee that you can buy a Super Nintendo and the game for less than $80.

58:07.160 --> 58:11.360
Oh no, I'm sure you can.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.000
The game is easy to find.

58:13.000 --> 58:18.440
I mean, it wasn't like a super limited production or anything, but you can find them.

58:18.440 --> 58:20.160
Most people don't understand that.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.160
I think I've got two copies.

58:21.160 --> 58:22.160
They think it's the Wii.

58:22.160 --> 58:24.120
If I have another copy I'll send it to somebody.

58:24.120 --> 58:28.960
I know this is hard for people that listen to this show to understand because you all

58:28.960 --> 58:32.680
are very gaming aware, you're culturally aware of the gaming community.

58:32.680 --> 58:36.780
I think there's a lot of people out there that honestly don't understand that.

58:36.780 --> 58:40.640
They don't think you can buy Super Nintendos anymore or they think that, well, it's on

58:40.640 --> 58:41.640
the Wii.

58:41.640 --> 58:42.640
It's a Wii version.

58:42.640 --> 58:43.640
It's different.

58:43.640 --> 58:46.200
No, it's not.

58:46.200 --> 58:48.280
They don't know that.

58:48.280 --> 58:50.380
All they know is that the game is on the Wii now.

58:50.380 --> 58:53.200
We are expert analysts of video games.

58:53.200 --> 58:54.560
Trust us.

58:54.560 --> 58:55.560
It's the same thing.

58:55.560 --> 59:00.040
It's like when they re-release The Wizard of Oz into theaters for a limited run.

59:00.040 --> 59:03.480
It's the same damn movie.

59:03.480 --> 59:05.080
They didn't put anything back.

59:05.080 --> 59:08.000
Dorothy suddenly does not go home.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
You know what I mean?

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
She still clicks her heels three times.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
That'd be fucking hilarious.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
They changed the ending.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
But no, the movie is still the same.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
You know what I mean?

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Nothing's changed.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.720
But a lot of people don't get that.

59:18.720 --> 59:19.720
I honestly truly think-

59:19.720 --> 59:22.940
It changed the ending and she's actually in the Insane Asylum like in the second movie.

59:22.940 --> 59:26.200
I honestly truly think people don't know that you can go out and still buy the game.

59:26.200 --> 59:30.640
They think that, oh, they've re-released this now and I can get it on my Wii for my kids.

59:30.640 --> 59:33.320
They should be listening to our podcast.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.040
Why aren't they?

59:35.040 --> 59:37.040
And some folks in the chat room seem to agree with me.

59:37.040 --> 59:38.520
Tiger Claw says true.

59:38.520 --> 59:41.540
And people who never bought a Mario game in their life, this will be their first entry

59:41.540 --> 59:42.540
to Mario.

59:42.540 --> 59:46.100
DDR Dollar Bill says, here's the thing, casual players aren't going to go out and find a

59:46.100 --> 59:48.820
Super Nintendo and then find the games.

59:48.820 --> 59:50.440
They don't know how to hunt at a free market.

59:50.440 --> 59:51.440
Lazy.

59:51.440 --> 59:52.440
I know.

59:52.440 --> 59:56.960
They're taking advantage of lazy people.

59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.200
Every industry out there takes advantage of people being lazy.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.240
We have certain infomercials exist.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:09.040
They create problems for people that people didn't have before so that they can sell them

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.760
a product for something, for a problem they didn't have.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.800
Thank you for reminding me because I actually have a problem with my cat not being able

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:20.220
to get high enough on our windows so I had to go buy a Sunny Seat for it.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.220
Your cat can live.

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.340
It's a cat.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.360
She needs to be higher up on the window.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.320
Shirmi sits on the damn floor.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.320
Cats desire height.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.320
When she wants sunlight, she goes and sits in front of the door.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:35.240
I think some of the greatest company ideas out there are formed on how can I allow people

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.240
to be more lazy.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.680
Like, let me give you an example.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.000
There's companies out there that will do takeout for any type of food and they just charge

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
like a surcharge over it.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.440
We have something called takeout taxi.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.120
Yeah, any restaurant in the world can get you takeout food.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.680
Now here's the thing.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:54.400
Not everybody who uses that is lazy because certainly you have homebound people, sick

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.800
people, people who don't have driver's license.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.800
People who are studying for their finals.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.160
But I'll bet you that's 10% of who's using it.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.160
Oh yeah.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.000
No, I understand.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.200
It's just, you know, what, I don't want to start ranting again.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.200
Forget it.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.200
No.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.200
Please rant.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.200
We haven't had good rants in a long time on this show.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:21.800
Why can't people just get off their asses and just put effort into shit, you know?

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.440
Because then I have to look away from my farm and my plants on my Farmville will die.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.080
I was just ranting, Rob.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:36.240
It's like, nothing is going to equal the experience of sitting down and playing the game on the

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.280
Super Nintendo with the right controller.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.320
It's just not going to be the same.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.880
And I mean, like, you know, that's the whole reason why we didn't get the new Donkey Kong,

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:46.880
Rob?

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.480
It's because you can't play it with a classic controller.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.680
It's not Donkey Kong.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.920
Oh wow.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.060
You have to do the little shaky thing.

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.640
They didn't want to put motion control in it.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.520
Miyamoto made them.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.240
That's retarded.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.240
I want to sit down and play a game that doesn't have motion control and I want to wear my

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:10.040
pajamas while I'm doing it so I can be lazy playing it the way it's meant to be played.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.140
So I'll go to effort to be lazy.

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:16.440
You know what's a really interesting comment here from XLink in our chat room?

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.620
Netflix is another company.

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:22.320
And I'm not, he didn't really put context to that so I'm assuming it means, like, Netflix

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.140
kind of made their money off lazy things.

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:29.760
But I don't know, like, I can definitely see that end of it but I don't know if I'd necessarily

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:33.600
call it lazy as much as it is damn convenient.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.480
You know, because what did we have to do before?

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.080
You had to get out, get in your car, go to the video store and so forth.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.160
It's just, it's more convenience in my opinion.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.680
It's also kind of the subscriber fee.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:50.320
You know, when Blockbuster had their stores, not until the end after Netflix was out did

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.920
they have these monthly fees where you could rent all the movies you wanted.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.800
Like I always, like that's why people like Netflix from what I understood was that, you

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:00.680
know, they could send one movie away and there'd be another one waiting for them and it's kind

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:05.120
of like, you know, I don't, I can kind of take that going to Blockbuster out of my daily

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.040
routine and watch more movies.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.360
I don't know if I would call that lazy though.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.280
I mean, I guess it is in a way.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.040
Yeah, it's, people are convenience centric.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:24.320
They're focused on convenience and, you know, I kind of miss, you know, going to Blockbuster

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.120
and looking at the movies and reading the backs of them and everything and going to

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:32.480
rent my games and the special rental only versions of stuff.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.280
Well there's still like one Blockbuster in every town if you want to do that.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.440
It's just farther away now.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.840
And the fucking red box thing.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:43.840
I hate the red box.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:48.080
That's why my husband doesn't have a job as a freaking red box.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.080
Hate it.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.880
I'm not really a big fan of red box either.

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:57.160
Like in my opinion, you should go out to the, like you should go out to a Blockbuster if

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.360
you're going to use something like red box.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.720
It's not that different.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.240
And this is what the other problem is too is that I think that there's a sort of forced

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:06.040
isolation going on people.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:11.040
You know, it used to be you had to get out and be in society and be a part of things,

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:17.280
but now it's like everyone's an individual and we have to cater to everybody and political

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.120
correct and blah, blah, blah.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:24.600
And I think that it's a matter of you're removing the human element from the equation.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.080
Ooh, good point from Frisbee in our chat room.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.040
Netflix eliminated the late fees.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.480
That's why it got so popular.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.480
That's a very good point.

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.800
But, but do you see what I do?

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.800
I do.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.800
I do.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.840
I have to make sure our chatters, every gamer has a voice.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:43.720
For example, even with world of Warcraft, going back to that, you're, you're not really

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:49.380
there hanging out with your people, you know, you're chatting and yeah, but it's impersonal.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.440
It's pretty impersonal I think.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.560
And what happened to getting people together and playing a board game or getting people

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:58.280
over for, you know, doing four player bomber man?

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:02.320
See, I like to do both, but sometimes it's not practical.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.320
You know what I mean?

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.540
Like sometimes I'm playing these games with people that live halfway across the country

01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:06.640
or all the way across the country.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640
That's fine.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.640
That's one thing.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.080
But I'm saying how many people in the guild live in town or near town?

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:17.720
I mean that, that's, you know, one point you, it used to be that we would, all of us would

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.520
get together like twice a week and play DDR or go to the arcade and something and now

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.720
it's just like, Oh, I'll see you online.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720
What happened to hanging out?

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.480
What happened to good old fashioned hanging out?

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.280
It's I think that the other thing with, with, you know, all of this is just that it's removing

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.560
the personal element from everything.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.440
We are a convenience driven society and we also don't like dealing with people because

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:43.400
it's inconvenient to, anyway, more ranting.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:48.600
Yet, yet there's a stigma in our society that we all need to be skinny and beautiful because

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.640
only skinny is beautiful.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:57.440
But the realistic end of it is that with how much we are lazy and convenience driven, it

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:04.800
ought to be that like, you know, sitting at home all day getting really, really, you know,

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.840
nonactive and stuff ought to be the pretty thing, right?

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.400
Cause that's where more people are at these days.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.400
I don't know.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.280
So what you're saying is like back in the middle ages.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.280
Sure.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:23.760
Cause if you know, you were fair skinned and stuff and nonworking, then you were more desirable.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.960
I would be so famous in the middle ages.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.240
All right.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.080
We're totally getting on this like off topic.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.360
Remember when big butts were in?

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:34.120
You have that magnet.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.280
I like big butts and I cannot lie.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.280
You either brothers can't deny.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.280
I thought you liked boobs.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.520
All right, let's move on.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520
Release dates.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.880
Let's travel around the world and see what is conveniently coming out to a store near

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.880
you.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:45.880
Yes.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.160
Not a whole lot this week yet, but there are a few things coming out, so that's good.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:59.040
The start of things off, Venetica, which is on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:02.400
Ghost Trick Phantom Detective on Nintendo DS.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.000
That's by the artwork from the guys that did stuff on the Ace Attorney series.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.760
So that looks pretty cool.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.320
DC Universe.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:15.360
They're going to have that available on PlayStation 3 and PC, both the regular and collector's

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.680
editions of those.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:22.280
Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude, on PSP.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.280
What?

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.600
Say that again.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.800
Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:35.120
Prinny's are the little guys in the Disgaea, little penguin dudes, right?

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.120
Yes.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.760
And this is about Operation Panties?

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.760
Yes.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:41.640
Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:46.440
Okay, like, what the fuck happened to this series when I wasn't watching it?

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.760
So, like, now there's a game coming out where the little penguins are going on a panty raid.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.280
Am I correct?

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.960
I'm not sure.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.720
What is Operation Panties?

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.280
I have no idea.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:00.200
Alright, keep going.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.880
I need to do some research.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:03.560
Kingdom Hearts Re-Coded.

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.760
That's coming out on Nintendo DS this week.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:14.320
Um, Spell Force 2, Faith and Destiny on PC.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:21.280
Um, let's see.

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.640
And that's basically it.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.640
Next week, lots of good stuff.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.480
But that's for next week's, or the week after next, I should say.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:32.240
I want me some Little Big Planet 2.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.200
There's no wiki entry on Prinny 2 Dawn of Operation Panties, dude.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.480
I'm trying to find more information on this.

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.480
I'm doing Google.

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.920
Give me a minute.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.920
Let's see.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.080
Okay, there's something on the PlayStation blog.

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.880
Let's see what this is all about.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:52.680
Prinny 2 is a side-scrolling hack and slash action game and you can play as Prinny.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.080
Your mission this time is to find the precious panties of demon lord Etna.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:02.440
Yes, you have to search for Etna's panties, or Etna swears that she will skin all Prinny's

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:05.240
and make them into panties.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.800
Well now that I think of that, Prinny panties would be kind of cool, but not for the Prinny's.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:15.040
You must find her panties by following morning in the game so you don't have any time to

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.040
dilly dally.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:21.320
Let's get to it, dude.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.880
Words escape me, folks.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.760
This is what gaming has become.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:26.760
Look at your life.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.760
Look at your choices.

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:33.880
What, what, what are you doing?

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:39.960
Insolacious pop is, is chiming in there.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.120
Etna, the demon girl was in Disgaea.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:46.240
Her panties are missing and you fight an action platformer to find them, but with panties

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:52.160
like in ghosts and goblins, those ghosts and goblins and panties.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.040
I just, I can't.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.600
Although you know what, this game probably deserves to sell more copies than a lot of

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.600
the stuff out there.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.720
I mean, hooray for them for giving gamers what they really want.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.720
Panties.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.440
Let's move on to Japan and talk about some of the crazy games coming out over there.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.400
On the Xbox 360, Arcana Heart 3 is making its way out this week.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.040
Arcana Heart, that's the all chick fighters, right?

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.040
Yeah.

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.740
Alright, number 3 is coming out.

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.040
Panties will fly.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.340
Or at least they will in my brain.

01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:31.440
James Bond Bloodstone comes out on 360 this week as well as Mass Effect 2, the Japanese

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.440
edition.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.600
It took them a little while to localize it for those guys.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:39.000
Stoked, big air edition also on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:46.720
And a very limited edition Arcana Heart 3 arcade stick coming out as well.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:53.820
Coming out on the Playstation 3, Arcana Heart 3 gets a version there as well and a joystick

01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:58.660
and James Bond Bloodstone also coming out on the Playstation 3 in Japan.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.600
So the releases kind of mirror each other there.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:05.880
Nothing on the Wii this week, in fact things are kind of quiet from Nintendo until we get

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.160
to the last story in a couple weeks.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.400
And then of course Nintendo is going to be all about the 3DS in Japan in just a little

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.400
bit.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.080
So things are going to be quiet there for a little bit, but we'll get back to them in

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.080
a while.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.600
The DS, also very quiet unless you want to get Zombie Daisuke, oh wait that's actually

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.600
next week.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.000
So there's nothing on the DS this week.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.640
But how about the PSP, there's a few games coming out there.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:33.080
Macross Ultimate Frontier gets a price reduction this week as does Umiwaza Yikari no Yasashi

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.040
Igo gets a price reduction.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.720
It's not coming out, it's getting a little cheaper and more affordable.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:46.720
And this game is, it's like that old game Go, but like with one of the world's experts

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:54.440
who's this kind of cute chick in her cyber form helping you to play that old game.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.720
Does she strip Go naked if I do well?

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:57.720
It's not strip Go.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.160
Get your mind out of the gutter.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.760
Not interested.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:06.880
Also Black Robina comes out this week from one of my favorite named companies over there,

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.880
Broccoli.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:10.280
You know what else Broccoli did?

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.280
What else?

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.280
Digi-Carrot.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.280
Ah.

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.880
Well they're doing Black Robina on the PSP this week.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.240
That's it for Japanese releases.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.880
Well for Europe there's a few.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.260
We have Zite on Xbox 360 for the 12th.

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:29.120
On the 14th is DC Universe Online and Ghost Trick.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.760
And also Kingdom Hearts Recoded.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.760
And that's it.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.940
Alright we're almost to the Classic Game of the Week, but first a couple more stories

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.360
for you guys.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.360
And this next story, you're going to want to remember this when we get into Part B tonight.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.360
Yes.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:51.360
HQ has partnered with Mattel and they're going to be doing some brand new license games based

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.480
on their properties.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:13:00.560
And of course some of the deals that they have in place already, well they've already

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.920
got some stuff I guess.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.800
He-Man by the power of Greyskull.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.180
So that's kind of cool.

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:15.300
And then they haven't really said what other rights they're also going to be working with

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.300
I guess.

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:21.120
Ah let's see here, they said Barbie Hot Wheels.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:25.080
It's kind of odd because Barbie and Hot Wheels right now, Activision kind of has the rights

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:28.200
to those because they've been making games for them for a while now.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.000
Mainly the Barbie stuff off of the DVD movies.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
If you believe it or not they keep releasing DVD movies for Barbie stuff.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:46.920
Fisher Price, Rock'em Sock'em Robots, Masters of the Universe, and Polly Pocket.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:51.920
And of course you know people are wondering, also they're going to be maybe doing some

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:58.640
tie-ins with the U-Draw game tablet because they do have that by the way.

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.440
So I don't know, it's interesting.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.720
I wonder if they're going to be doing any off of the new Masters of the Universe series.

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.800
Is that even still around?

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.800
Do they show it in reruns?

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.800
I don't know.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.080
Weren't they supposed to be optioning a new movie or something for that?

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:19.320
Well Dolph Lundgren needs more work.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.360
I'm serious man, the guy- Isn't he like senile by now?

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.040
He's got to be getting pretty old.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.760
He was in Expendables, he's not that old.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:31.000
Well Expendables was different though, it brought back everybody for that movie.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.360
They're all pretty old.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:36.160
Alright, one more story for you guys, then the classic game of the week.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.240
And this has to do with some big announcements, the Consumer Electronics Show this week, which

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.900
usually isn't a gaming show per se, but a few things will always get slipped in there

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:48.360
because of course gaming consoles are what's in your living room.

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.840
And one place that gaming consoles have really expanded beyond just the place you play video

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:58.100
games is being an entertainment device, letting you watch movies and Netflix on them.

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:01.480
And Microsoft talked a little bit about Netflix expansion.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:06.000
Coming this spring, Netflix will get Kinect enabled.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.560
So you'll be able to flail your arms to queue up episodes of Veronica Mars if that's how

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.560
you choose to do it.

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.600
I bet this will be one of those things where you use it a couple times to impress your

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.480
friends and then you're done with it.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.960
Because you know, as cool as the Kinect technology is, I don't know, it'd be a little slow to

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.640
like wave your arms and then kind of look for the movie you're looking for.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.880
Now where this might be really cool is that instead of fumbling for the controller, which

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:36.200
is probably off, if you're able to say, Kinect, pause, so you can go up and get a sandwich,

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.200
that will be great.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.600
That will be the coolest thing about Xbox Netflix.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.320
Kinect, make me a sandwich.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.540
Maybe next year's CES, who knows.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.840
Also announced though is that Hulu will be coming to Xbox.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:51.140
It's out on the PlayStation, but Hulu Plus will be coming to the Xbox 360 at the same

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:53.320
time later this spring.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.820
So there you go.

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:59.060
One other little tidbit that was dropped in the press conference, remember how Microsoft

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:03.320
had a goal of selling 5 million Kinect units by Christmas?

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.720
Well they came out at CES and said they sold 8 million units.

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:12.080
But some people have said, wait a minute, did you really sell 8 million units?

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.360
Or did you push 8 million units out there to retailers?

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.640
Hmm.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.760
Well regardless of however the numbers are being skewed, it still is a fairly impressive

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.760
amount.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.700
I guarantee if they, I think those are sold numbers because they haven't been sitting

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:27.700
on shelves.

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:28.700
Let me put it that way.

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.880
They're hard to find.

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.880
So yeah, and who knew?

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:38.000
A lot of people thought that that was going to be a high number for them to break because

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.480
that's way more than they sold 360s in the first year.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:45.440
Of course 360s were really hard to get at that time, so I don't know.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.840
These are still hard to get.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.640
Are they really?

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.640
I guess I'm spoiled by what you have to say.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.600
It seems that way at least.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.080
Probably not for retailers.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.840
It's pretty easy to get for them.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:02.280
I like how everybody in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrady.com is coming out with their own ideas for what

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.240
Connect should do on voice command.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.760
Like DDR Dollar Bill says, Connect, get me a beer.

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:14.000
Frisbee in our chatroom says, Computer, end holodeck.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.040
DDR Dollar Bill says, Connect, ban this douchebag who called me a racial slur.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:24.000
Someday, someday.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.280
Tiger Claw, Xbox, play Tron, Tron, Tron, I said Tron, damn it.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:32.440
Yeah, it would be like the voice recognition on the DS.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:38.920
Blue, blue, brew.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.320
That joke will make sense if you've ever played Brain Age.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:44.880
Alright, let's move on to the classic game of the week.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:45.880
Yay.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:51.480
It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane to gaming's past where Dark Soccer is

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.740
going to step into the vault and pull a game out of the archives and she thinks, hey, you

01:17:55.740 --> 01:18:03.000
ungrateful kids, you should put down all those newfangled holiday toys and your 3DSs and

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.920
play games the way we used to where we had to walk barefoot through the snow both ways,

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:14.800
20 miles up the river and eat our grape nuts to play these games.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:15.800
I'm still hungry, Rob.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.400
All I've had is pizza.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.520
Alright, what is the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer?

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:26.020
Space Fury, specifically Space Fury on the ColecoVision.

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.560
You have to play a little bit of, you have to play the opening taunt.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.120
I love that music.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.120
Okay.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:45.640
So this is the screen where you select your difficulty.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.800
Suddenly I'm watching a Space Odyssey.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:51.160
That was something that we heard a lot of in my house when I was in the third grade.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.160
I love this game.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.160
Isn't it great?

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.160
Okay.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:59.000
Now, before I go into the ColecoVision version, which is what this is, I'm going to have to

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
go into the arcade version.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.160
It was put out by Sega on June 17th, 1981.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.960
It has a rotate left, rotate right and thrust and fire.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:14.880
So basically it's kind of, it kind of plays like asteroids, but you, as you go through

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.840
the game, you actually can get like a little armored unit that takes you to different levels

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.920
of different things you can shoot, except that these little segments combine into a

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.920
bigger segment.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:29.360
And then you have to, you know, blow up the smaller segments and stuff, but they can blow

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.360
you up.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:33.560
It looks like a little bit time pilot, which kind of was asteroids inspired too.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.400
It's kind of like between the two.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.100
As far as the arcade, the arcade version was vector.

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:45.160
So of course this one's not vector, but the, uh, the arcade version, it was vector on an

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:50.040
XY monitor and it ran on the Sega G80 arcade system.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:56.960
Had some of the best lines in it, like, so a creature for my amusement, prepare for battle.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:01.040
And my favorite one is, and I keep in mind, my mother was great at this game.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.400
She played a lot of freaking space fury.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:09.200
Um, but like when you, uh, win the game, basically the last thing that you get is, our battle

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.360
is concluded, warrior.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.960
You were a stimulating opponent.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:19.160
And the alien in this also appears in a video game called Zektor.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:24.320
Now for the Colecovision version, of course it's sprite based.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:29.160
It's, you know, really, really early video game system.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.840
I don't know what else I can say about that.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:36.360
Um, but you use the little, uh, uh, cause it had the keypad controller, so you'd actually,

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:43.320
uh, thrust and go with your little side shoulders and fire that the same way and, uh, move around.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.240
It was actually kind of hard to control.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:51.120
I was not good at this game, but like I said, a lot of this game happened in my house.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:58.440
And you can get, you know, power ups for shooting and, you know, get extra, uh, bullets and

01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.440
everything.

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.320
So it was really cool, but, it's simple.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.240
You blow shit up, the game.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.760
I love this game and I played it on the Colecovision actually, it was one of the games that I really

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:10.760
enjoyed playing.

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.560
I never had a Colecovision growing up.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.560
Well...

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.200
I've got two, you wanna borrow one?

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.680
I'm not growing up anymore.

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:20.000
Oh come on, Rob, we know you're still growing up.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.440
I am.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.520
This is when it talked to you.

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:31.080
The voice is so realistic.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:35.120
That's even better than Impossible Mission.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:39.480
Another visitor, stay awhile, stay forever.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.960
So that's Space Fury.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:46.220
Alright, your classic game of the week this week is Space Fury.

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:47.440
Good pick.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.520
Even if it's not one I'm super familiar with, it looked very interesting, so I will have

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:52.520
to check it out.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.840
I think I've already done Gorf, haven't I?

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.840
I'm sure you have.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.840
I'm sure you have.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.600
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, guys, but don't go anywhere.

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:01.080
We're gonna be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio in Part B tonight.

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:07.640
We're gonna do some quick, quick news, including some news on what's going on with APB, Bionic

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:11.040
Commander Rearmed 2, we got some news on, and we're gonna get some other news stories

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:16.960
tonight about the Mac App Store, of course, your Twitter topics, the mailbag, and, because

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:20.520
Dark Sakura specifically asked for it before the show started tonight, we're gonna do a

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.520
list list tonight.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.720
I hope you were paying attention in Part A, because it has to do with what our list list

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:25.720
is about.

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:35.560
We'll tell you all about that when we come right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:39.600
And welcome back, everybody, to Part B of tonight's Orange Launch Radio.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:47.640
It is episode number 396 for this January the 9th of 2011.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.640
And I know we can't play the music on the break when you guys listen to this on the

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.320
podcast, but we had some music from Tron in there, just because Loki was talking about

01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:00.080
how he wanted to go see that just one more time before it leaves the whole D-Box thing.

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:04.240
And I'm kind of in the same boat, except the place I need to see it is IMAX, and even though

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.920
I hear it's actually not as great on IMAX as it is in 3D, at least that was a consensus

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:13.000
on my Facebook post earlier this week, I still just feel like I need to see it, so I see

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.960
it once in every format.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.800
But I guess the Blu-ray's coming out soon.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:20.640
Well, not soon, but, you know, it will come out and that will be a must-have.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.880
But Blu-rays that came out recently that I need to see, I still have not seen this movie,

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:25.880
can you believe it?

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.880
Inception?

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.400
I still haven't seen it, and I need to.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:29.400
You do need to see that.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:30.400
That is pretty awesome.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.400
I hear it.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.120
I've heard nothing but great things about that movie, and now that the Blu-ray's out,

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.640
I'm gonna need to see that, so.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:38.880
It is absolutely something you should see.

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.960
That was something else I missed in D-Box, though that would have been a good movie in

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:43.960
D-Box.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:44.960
Inception.

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:45.960
Oh, really?

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:46.960
Yeah.

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.800
Well, D-Box is kind of really, really new, isn't it?

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:50.800
It's really, really new, yeah.

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.720
The theater out here that has it is like brand spanking new.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:58.400
It's brand spanking new, and it's only in one theater, and it's only one row of seats,

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.760
so it's pretty-

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.760
It's two rows of seats in the theater I was in.

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.760
Oh.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:03.760
Then maybe it is two rows.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.760
I thought it was just one.

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:07.280
But yeah, it's only one theater that they have it in.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.280
Oh, wow.

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.280
Very limited, but.

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.280
So.

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.860
It's fun, and it's one of 30 theaters that has it.

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:16.840
And that's, of course, the seats that move, the little motion seats that, you know.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.840
It's fun.

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:20.120
It's completely unnecessary for a lot of movies.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:24.200
Like the only movie I've seen in D-Box was the Resident Evil movie, and honestly, I'm

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:28.360
not a fan of the Resident Evil series and stuff, but that movie is so far away from

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.360
the Resident Evil game series.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.080
It's more of like The Matrix now.

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.760
It was still pretty cool, and I think with Tron, though, just even watching Tron the

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.200
first time around, it's gonna be awesome with the D-Box stuff.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.520
I'm really looking forward to it.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.800
Let us know when you're going.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.320
I even think, though, probably Wednesday during the day-

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:48.440
I'm glad I did the D-Box thing, but it was a little silly.

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.680
It was a little silly.

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.040
But it's cool to say you did it.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.040
Which movie did you do it for?

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.040
Tron.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:55.040
Oh, you did?

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.040
Yeah.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.040
We saw Christmas Eve.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.040
Oh.

01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.040
Did you like it?

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.040
D-Box?

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:05.200
Because I really liked Tron, yes, but it was a little unnecessary, and it was kind of expensive.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.200
Don't expect to get just, like, thrown around in the seats, because that ain't happening.

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:12.320
I mean, you can't adjust the intensity of it, but I would compare it a little more to

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.080
like Captain EO, where the movements in the seats are very subtle.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:18.520
No, I just, there was a lot of the flying stuff in there, I thought that'd be pretty

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.520
cool.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.520
Yeah, some of it's kind of neat.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.480
But I kind of agree, and I think we had talked about it on the show a couple weeks ago, or

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:27.240
maybe, I don't remember, but one of the things that kind of takes you out of the reality

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:32.400
of it is that it is not an IMAX screen, and your field of vision is not completely the

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:36.400
movie, because it's a regular-sized movie screen, and I think if the screen were a lot

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.960
bigger or you had something else in those seats to take the rest of your field of vision

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:45.680
away, that would make it truly amazing, I think.

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.320
Or that they have to make it like pitch pitch black in there, which they can't, you know,

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.000
that's what they do on things like Star Tours and stuff, to kind of take you out of that,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.080
but yeah, you know, they can't do that for emergency reasons and for people who want

01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.600
to leave to go to the bathroom, so yeah.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:04.880
I think D-Box still has some tweaking that they need to do, but it was, you know what,

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:05.880
it was fun.

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:11.880
To save up like the eight grand or whatever, get a home unit, they have them, it's compatible

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.320
with a lot of those movies.

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:19.840
You know, I wouldn't invest in that again unless it was a movie like Tron where I know

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:26.400
I love it and I want to see it a new way, and you know, that's really it.

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:29.920
DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says, so a D-Box is like Honey, I Shrunk the Audience

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:30.920
at Disney.

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.400
No, because those chairs don't move.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.160
The movie's a lot better, too, because Honey, I Shrunk the Audience was terrible.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:39.080
Well, those seats don't move, though, in Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.600
A little bit, they do a little bit.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.600
A little bit.

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.880
And I liked that because Eric Idle is in it.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:48.240
There's a part when the baby picks up the audience and does this thing and-

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.000
You gotta admit, that part was pretty cool.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.880
Yeah, but the movie itself was dopey.

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:53.600
Yeah, it was.

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.120
It really outstayed its welcome.

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.000
I mean, when was the last time they made a Honey, I blank the kids?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.880
Well, you know, I had to say because Eric Idle was in it.

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:04.080
I am really sad that Rick Moranis is not getting more work.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.120
I mean, seriously.

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:07.240
That was by his choice, I believe.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.120
I believe he retired to raise his children.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.840
Okay, well, then props to him.

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.840
Once you make Strange Brew, you can retire.

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.320
That's what it is, I guess.

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.320
All right.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.880
I still think his best movie was My Blue Heaven.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.760
But his children have to be grown up by now.

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.400
I mean, come on, go back.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:27.760
The rumor is he'll cameo in Ghostbusters 3, but we'll see.

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:30.640
There's lots of rumors about that movie.

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.040
That's a day one for me.

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.040
All right.

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.360
Anyhow, Twitter topics coming up very soon.

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.520
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. First, we're going to get into some rapid fire news, but I also

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.160
have to give quick, quick plugs for the other shows.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:47.560
Dark Sakura does a side podcast with her friends, Marin Marvel and Dan Shadow.

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:50.400
It's called Comic Insanity, and we have a Twitter now.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.800
It's Comic Insanity without an I before the N.

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:58.600
And yes, we got a tweet from Comic Insanity tonight, so we'll read that in a little bit.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.600
Yep.

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:05.240
And we, the podcast goes up every Tuesday at Infamous.net.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.660
That's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.

01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:10.160
Or the iTunes store, I'm sure.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.160
We are in the iTunes store.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.160
Awesome.

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:14.520
And you have to listen to it.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.400
If you're a loyal O-L-R listener, you have to listen to that, too.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.640
And you should also listen to Hoard House.

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:23.320
Even if you don't play Wow, you can hear Extrovert Make Dick and Fart Jokes.

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:27.440
Hoard House, the best little Hoard House in Azeroth, tapes on Thursdays, typically.

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:31.080
We don't want to be held to that, but usually if we don't do Thursday, we'll do Friday.

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:34.480
So later in the week is when we do our show and we put it right up on iTunes so you folks

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.640
can grab that.

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:36.760
And yeah, it's a fun show.

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:40.140
We always have a third random guest, and Dark Soccer has made it known she wants to come

01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:41.480
on and be that guest.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.440
So we're gonna work her into a future episode.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.100
Sadly won't happen this week.

01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:48.280
We're having our gala 10th episode special this week.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.280
A look back...

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.280
10th anniversary?

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.280
Yes.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:53.480
A look back at 10 hilarious episodes of The Best Little Hoard House in Azeroth.

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:54.480
It'll be a good time.

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.640
And very self-serving because that's what anniversary podcasts should be.

01:28:57.640 --> 01:28:59.480
They're making a big, big deal for our...

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:03.120
Like I'm telling you, the 10th episode of Hoard House is a much bigger deal than 400

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.120
episodes of OLR.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.280
I mean, I'm sorry, but that's, that's just...

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.280
It's a joke, Dark Soccer.

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.280
It's...

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.280
Get it?

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.280
I'm eating.

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:15.040
All right, let's get to some rapid fire news.

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.840
I can't make weird faces at you when I'm doing chipmunk cheeks.

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.640
We don't have a website, by the way.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:23.120
We're not on Infamous.net and we are not even on OrangeLawnTrader.com.

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:27.840
We have a blog spot and really, that's just the shell for the podcast feed.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:28.840
Awesome.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.240
So, we don't have a website right now.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.240
Before I forget, Geek Life.

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.120
Go to geek-life.com.

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.160
We're having a comic book giveaway, so go in there and read about it.

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.960
And by the way, speaking of Geek Life, Maren Marvel, who runs that and who has filled in

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.480
for me on this very program, she was on episode 8 of Hoard House, not this week's, but last

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.480
week's episode.

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:47.480
She did a phenomenal job.

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.540
So if you haven't heard that episode of Hoard House, you should go listen to it.

01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:50.960
She did a very good job.

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:57.320
All right, let's go and to some rapid fire news, some of the news stories that we just

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:01.600
didn't find the long amounts of time to talk about in other parts of the show, but we want

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.320
to talk about them anyway.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:07.000
APB Reloaded, they're doing a beta for it.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
How ironic, because I actually participated in the original APB beta.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.660
But if you're interested in that, they're going to be starting to close beta in February.

01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:23.460
The official Twitter account, APB Reloaded, has more information on that.

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:29.320
And apparently they're going to be having, you can sign up on the official website.

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:36.160
And it is of course going to be free to play when it finally launches, unlike the original

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.160
APB.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:42.800
And I didn't think APB was that bad of a game.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:47.600
I thought it was actually pretty cool, but unfortunately it didn't last too long.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:52.160
But definitely worth checking out, especially since it's going to be free to play.

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:56.920
The PSP Go has been hacked, not surprisingly.

01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:06.800
The brand new, I guess, firmware, 6.31 and 6.35, have a new homebrew enabler for them.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:13.640
And using this homebrew enabler, you're actually able to load the Prometheus ISO Loader, which

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:19.280
for those who don't know, it loads dumps of different PSP games.

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:26.800
And of course the PSP game to show off your hack would be Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep,

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:33.680
the PSP game that does not have a digital version of it on the PlayStation Network Store,

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:37.400
pissing off people that own a PSP Go.

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:43.480
And of course, this homebrew enabler doesn't really require any sort of tricks to get it

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:49.120
to work, so that's not good news for Sony, but I'm sure they'll try to find a way to

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:52.280
patch that out.

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:59.600
And then finally, there's a couple games in this series that have been available on the

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:02.220
IOS store.

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:08.560
Of course the Japanese App Store, or if you have a jailbroken iPhone or iPod, you can

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:12.320
also find these available as well.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:16.320
It's Game Dev Story, and of course there's Game Dev Story 2.

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:22.800
Well now there's a brand new game that they have coming out called YY the Game Dealer.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:30.680
It's basically a game retail store sim.

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:35.200
And the Game Dealer, you assume the role of a game store boss who must manage employees

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:41.040
and please customers, all while balancing the stock portfolio of game development studios,

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:48.700
and apparently also be able to offer customers food, and shoo-way mall rats from the free

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.700
food mini-games.

01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:54.280
That's funny.

01:32:54.280 --> 01:33:00.340
But I guess the Game Dealer is available on the Japanese App Store right now.

01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:02.240
That sounds like fun.

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:05.920
That's real life for a lot of people that listen to this show, I'm sure.

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:06.920
Awesome.

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:11.440
Alright, let's go to Rock Band and what is coming out this week in Rock Band.

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.640
They're still kicking along with new releases.

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:18.480
Although this is a new release, I'm going to take a big fat pass on, but maybe some

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:20.040
of you out there are into this.

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:23.560
Linkin Park Pack comes out this week, January 11th.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:29.720
Crawling in the End, Numb, Somewhere I Belong, Waiting for the End, and What I've Done.

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:34.920
All those songs are coming out for either 160 Microsoft Points, 200 Wii Points, or $1.99

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:36.420
on the PlayStation Store.

01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:42.120
You can also get some Pro Guitar or Bass expansions for the song, In the End, and What I've Done.

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:45.960
Again, if you like Linkin Park, that is.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:49.360
If you are a fan of Elder Scrolls and you were just sitting there tapping your fingers

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:54.560
waiting for Skyrim to come out, well maybe now is a good time to go back and visit Morrowind.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:59.840
There's a brand new mod that just came out called Morrowind 2011, Morrowind 2011 was

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:06.080
a mod that was released last week, and it basically makes Morrowind just even more gorgeous

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.080
than it was originally.

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:10.760
Because remember Morrowind, I mean it was, for the time it was awesome graphics, but

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.680
man they really kind of upped the graphics, there was a bunch of mods out there that just

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:16.600
made the game look beautiful.

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:21.680
Well here's the thing though, it was out, but then it was pulled, because I guess this

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:26.400
used some other mods in it, and maybe the right people didn't quite get credit for it,

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.520
when some of the original modders complained on the Bethesda forums that their work was

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.760
being used.

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:35.440
So the original mod was pulled, but you guys know, once it hits the internet, it's never

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.080
truly off of the internet.

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:42.920
The author who originally made this whole expansion, he talked about it on his blog,

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:48.240
which is at Morrowind2011.wordpress.com, he said quote, in the end I'm just very disappointed

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:52.200
that I wasn't given a chance to correct the issues with the package, as I knew there were

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.980
issues that were in the process of being fixed or updated.

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:58.160
But the file is out on the internet, and it will be very hard for anyone to remove it

01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.920
from all the sites.

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:05.600
Anyhow, one other thing, and I'm very excited about this, the Facebook Civilization game.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.880
That's right, I'm getting excited about a Facebook game, what are you going to do about

01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:08.880
it?

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.600
Civilization World starts its alpha testing phase on January 12th.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:17.720
You can go sign up for it now, but it was a little weird, because I guess you need to

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:21.800
have like a team name and all this other stuff, I don't know, it didn't make a lot of sense

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.640
to me when I was filling it out, and I don't know if I want to play the alpha, I'll just

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.640
wait for the open beta.

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:29.240
But that means this game is mere months away, so very exciting, and when you look at the

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:32.880
graphics for it, it looks very like chibi and cute and kind of unlike any other Civ

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:35.680
game we've seen yet, so it's going to be very interesting.

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:43.160
Civ World, again, you can sign up at 2kgames.com slash civworld slash alpha.

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.540
Dark Soccer, what do you got for us?

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:51.960
More stuff, and some weird stuff among it, but including this weird ass mustache.

01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.160
And I'll get into that.

01:35:53.160 --> 01:36:00.960
Basically, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 is coming out, along with an extra mustache on the dude,

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.600
and jumping!

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:07.280
It will be on Playstation Network on Tuesday, February 1st, it will be $15, and then the

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:12.100
next day it will be on Xbox Live Arcade for 1200 Microsoft points.

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:15.680
And there will be challenge rooms and mustache!

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.040
So yeah.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.040
It's very Burt Reynolds, porn-stache-looking.

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:25.080
Anyway, there's still more Sailor Moon stuff, Rob.

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.080
Did you know that?

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.880
Sailor Moon!

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:36.200
Well, Sailor Moon is having a new DS game come out in Italy!

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:42.600
Anamco Bandai Europe is bringing the first Sailor Moon DS game, and it's the second Sailor

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.120
Moon game that's being released outside of Japan.

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:54.040
And it's called La Luna Splenda, which, yeah, very Sailor Moon-y.

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:58.200
And they're saying it's adventure, fantasy, fun, action, these are the watchwords for

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.360
next spring.

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:06.880
Yeah, the last Sailor Moon game that I had was on the Super Nintendo.

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:13.560
And trailers for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 reveal two more characters.

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:18.320
And one of them I saw coming, the other one I'm like, why?

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.900
Even though it is cool, don't get me wrong, it's absolutely cool.

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:25.840
The first one we get is Hagar from Final Fight.

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.800
And what is it, Saturday Night Slam Masters?

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:29.800
That game was so awesome.

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.720
I wish we could get that on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.400
He's gonna be wrasslin' his way through Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:40.720
And then Phoenix, which I'm like, why?

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:46.300
I think it's really why, but at the same time, very very cool with lots of Fuego, and she

01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:48.740
freakin' has Dark Phoenix mode.

01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:49.740
So that's really cool.

01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:53.860
I like how the characters have multiple modes for them based on their level of, you know,

01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:54.860
how powered up they are.

01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:56.360
It's pretty cool.

01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:58.200
So booyah.

01:37:58.200 --> 01:37:59.960
This game is out, what, next month is it?

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:00.960
I can't remember.

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:01.960
Yes.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:02.960
I get my release dates all mixed up.

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:03.960
That's gonna be exciting.

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:04.960
It's pretty cool.

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:05.960
Alright.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.440
Well is that it for the rapid fire news?

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:08.440
Yarp.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.240
Then we will get into the Twitter topics for tonight.

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:17.160
I'm gonna go to the tweeters, twitter.com slash o-l-r, where you show us your tweets

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.240
every Sunday night you're on this program.

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:25.200
Let's start off with a tweet from Comic Insanity, hmm, I didn't just hear a plug for them earlier

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.820
in the show or what have you.

01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:31.960
It's a story about Street Fighter characters for WWE Raw versus SmackDown, which is this

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:35.720
trailer here, sorry for the extra music there, but I got linked to a YouTube.

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:41.600
I guess they have actually kind of used the editor mode to make like Ken and Vega and

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:46.800
Blanca, Dalsim, somebody having fun with the editor mode there.

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:47.800
That's kind of cute.

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:48.800
Oh yeah.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.000
I like how they can get the interview with M. Bison and everything, kind of funny.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.800
Yeah, we were talking about that on the show earlier.

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:55.800
Oh were you?

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:56.800
Yeah.

01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:57.800
Yeah.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:02.640
That's very well done and the moves are pretty much what you'd expect out of them.

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.240
You know, I don't really play a lot of these wrestling games, but that's pretty cool.

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.240
Dude, Dudley.

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.240
Yeah.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.240
I like this too.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:12.760
In the side, like what's recommended, it looks like there's a Felicia in one of these.

01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:14.760
Like somebody did that.

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.000
Wow.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.600
Big boobies on Felicia, alright anyway.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:27.360
Moving on, going to SSJ100Matt on Twitter, our pal YYR will be at MAGFest in Washington

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:30.200
D.C. next week showing off his games.

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.560
Local listeners should stop by, MAGFest.org.

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.680
Well if you're in the Washington D.C. area and you happen to be going to MAGFest, say

01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:41.120
hello to YYR for us because he does a lot of great indie games on the marketplace like

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:46.680
Snake 360 and the Shooting Gallery game and Falling.

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:49.960
Lots of good stuff so check that out at Ollie's booth.

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:54.880
Dark Tetsuya wants to relay a bit of bad news for us.

01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:00.080
Apparently we had a BeatMania 2DX Resort Anthem machine at Roseville Golf Land.

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:02.640
It's been moved to Milpenis.

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:04.380
Bye.

01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:05.380
That sucks.

01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:06.380
Like did...

01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:07.380
To hell with them.

01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:09.480
Does that mean the whole 2DX machine's gone all together?

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.480
That blows.

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:13.480
F you Milpenis.

01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:14.480
Milpenis.

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:16.920
Alright.

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:17.920
How mature of you.

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:19.040
I know, I'm so mature.

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:22.840
Tiger Claw wants to send us some links here.

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:29.200
Tiger Claw says Ion and Atari is teaming up for the iCade, a classic arcade machine setup

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.200
for your iPad.

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:35.400
Oh that's adorable, it's this cute little machine with tangible joystick and buttons

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:41.920
that you can put your iPad in and like play old games with.

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:42.920
That's cool.

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:43.920
I like that.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:50.000
I love the fact that you can buy a, you know, I know it's a really expensive way of playing

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.680
something that you can get a million other ways, but it's still cute.

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.600
I say it was cute.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.800
And one more tweet for us from Tiger Claw.

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:05.080
Microsoft confirms that Kinect PC support is coming.

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:06.080
Well good.

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.720
They should, as it should be, because if the modding community is so far ahead of them

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:11.080
it's almost a little bit embarrassing.

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.560
I mean it is coming, it already is here basically.

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.760
Well my official Kinect PC support is coming.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:22.520
Steve Ballmer hinted at this support in his keynote speech there.

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.680
It is part of the company's larger plan.

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:29.000
Well, we certainly started out on Xbox and we're very focused in on gaming.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.880
We're the number one game console in a lot of countries and we're very happy about that.

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:36.240
We're trying to do two major things though.

01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:41.600
We're trying to move beyond gaming to include the world of socialization, movies, TV, and

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.240
music and we're trying to make the whole experience accessible to everybody in the family, not

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.000
just the traditional gamer.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.680
So just expect this whole Kinect craze to grow, at least if Microsoft's keynote is to

01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:54.640
be taken at face value.

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:59.520
Those are the tweets tonight at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Let's move into some more gaming

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.520
news.

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:02.000
Hey, guess what's coming up in just a little bit?

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.040
Listless!

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.240
And tonight's topic is?

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:06.840
Well, I'll tell you in a little bit.

01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:09.600
We need, we're going to need somebody from the chat room to participate with us tonight,

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:10.600
aren't we?

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:11.600
We're going to need a fourth person.

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:12.600
We sure will.

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.000
So I better find someone quick.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.720
I'm going to see, I have a particular person in mind.

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:17.040
I want to see if they want to participate.

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:20.440
If not, I'll open it up to anyone.

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:24.260
All right.

01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:28.800
So this is kind of interesting and not too different than what they were doing.

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:36.540
I guess it's an improvement maybe, but THQ for homefronts, they're doing the online pass

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:37.740
thing again.

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.880
But this time, instead of just saying, hey, you know what, you better buy the game new

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:48.280
or pay the $10 and have no online play, they're saying, hey, you know what, you better buy

01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:55.220
the game new or pay $10 or have limited online play.

01:42:55.220 --> 01:43:00.080
They're going to allow you to play the multiplayer component of the game, however, you're only

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:06.480
going to be able to level up to level five versus the full game's level 75.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.900
So kind of give you a little bit of a taste of the online portion of the game.

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:14.800
Of course, if you're going to want to play the online portion, you're probably going

01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:23.200
to want to buy the game new or perhaps not rent the game.

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.240
I don't know.

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:28.560
It's still kind of a crappy way of doing things, but it's slightly better than not offering

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:30.780
any online component at all.

01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:33.920
So now you get a demo of the online component.

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:35.760
That's basically what this boils down to.

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:40.880
That's kind of weird.

01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:42.760
That's them combating the use sales.

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:48.080
But of course, I don't know if this is a game I'm particularly interested in, so we'll see.

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:49.080
Who knows?

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.080
It'll look cool.

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.080
All right.

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:53.480
Let's move on to another story here about the Mac App Store.

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.480
It is out.

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.480
It came out this week.

01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:00.000
And guess what the number one thing that's being sold on the Mac App Store is right now?

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Angry Birds.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
That's right.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.400
Angry Birds is the number one application.

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:04.960
Some other games are showing up in the top 10.

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:08.440
Of course, this changes day by day, so it might not be totally accurate, but some of

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:12.680
the early leaders were Flight Control HD and Chopper 2.

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:13.680
That's right.

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:18.520
Some of the same crap that you see on the iPhone and iPad is also dominating the Mac

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:19.520
App Store.

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:25.120
Now, if you don't know what the Mac App Store is, it's basically imagine Steam and Apple

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:26.120
kind of combined.

01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:32.400
It's selling, I don't want to say PC games, but Mac games like for your actual Mac in

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:35.760
the same vein that you buy iPad and iPod stuff right now.

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:36.760
I think it's a great idea.

01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:41.600
Well, it's a very logical idea that makes sense and especially because, you know, a

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.120
lot of these games are kind of cheaper this way.

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:46.800
Like games like Chopper 2, 99 cents.

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:49.720
Angry Birds, five bucks.

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:54.160
So I mean that's much cheaper than going into an actual store and paying 20 or even 40 bucks

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:55.160
for one of these.

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.400
Of course, not everything is so cheap.

01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:04.160
I mean some programs like iMovie is 15 bucks, Aperture 80 bucks, you know, but it's a way

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:07.240
for them to sell, you know.

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:09.840
So interesting.

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:13.120
But what also is notable about this, hackers.

01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:16.600
You know the old saying, hackers gonna hack.

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:19.240
So actually I just made up that saying.

01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.880
So now we have haters gonna hate and hackers gonna hack.

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:26.440
Well, hackers gonna hack and they found the loophole in the Mac App Store.

01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:28.480
They pirated Angry Birds already.

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.480
It took less than just a couple of days.

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.880
Yep, that's it.

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:37.000
Apparently all you have to do is like copy and paste this in-store purchase code and

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.240
yeah, you can get the games for free.

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.240
By the way, I love this.

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:45.160
The name of the group that hacked the games, Hackulous.

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.160
Get it?

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.160
Like Tapulous?

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:52.020
Well, Hackulous actually, they're responsible for the program Instalus which is what people

01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:56.800
used to download pirated games on the iPod.

01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:01.640
But I think, I keep thinking of like Tapulous who makes Tap Tap Revenge.

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:04.000
That would be fun.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Alright.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.080
Alright, let's move on with some more stories, Dark Sakura.

01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:15.320
Well, for Monster Hunter fans, this is actually kind of neat, actually video game companies

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:21.520
have been using different games to promote tourism in Japan.

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:29.720
My Nietzsche Daily News actually reported that Shibu Hot Springs in Nagano actually

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:36.600
worked with Capcom to have a Monster Hunter Portable 3 event go on because the town itself

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:40.060
was similar to the one used in the game.

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:45.040
And they had a lot of people go up, including people who said that they probably would have

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:49.120
never gone had there not been the Monster Hunter event.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:53.760
And I've got a couple friends that live overseas who were totally into Monster Hunter and will

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:57.520
go to the special Capcom events and camp out outside their offices and stuff.

01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.760
So, pretty crazy stuff.

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:07.840
Konami did something similar for Love Plus, the Atami Onsen, so they did the same thing.

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:19.080
And one was done, let me see if I can pronounce this right, Shakunage no Mori Botanical Park

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:20.800
in Mimata.

01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:23.220
So they did something too.

01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:28.000
That was for Kalanina Sekatsu Plus.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.300
The reason why I was excited to hear you talk about this story is because I want to beat

01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:35.640
the dead horse of when are we going to get a video game theme park?

01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:39.200
Like seriously, Angry Birds is super popular.

01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:43.480
Can't Angry Birds be a ride at a theme park now, even though I care less about the game?

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:45.120
Can we get Angry Birds the ride?

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:49.800
Can you imagine if you could go on a Mario Brothers roller coaster where as you're going

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:54.920
up, imagine, can you know that part of California Screamin' where it goes up, down, up, down,

01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:55.920
up, down?

01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:56.920
Is that my favorite part?

01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.920
Yeah, a bunch of hills really fast.

01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:04.320
What should happen is at the top of every hill on the Mario coaster, bling, bling.

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.840
Tell me they could not make an awesome theme park out of a video game.

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:07.840
They could do it.

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.360
I mean, I guess it would be all the licensing and so forth that would be a pain in the ass,

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:14.320
but still, make it happen.

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.440
They made a game in a theme park.

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:17.440
The Toy Story game.

01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:18.440
Oh, that's true.

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:19.440
That was fun.

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.440
That Toy Story game is awesome.

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:25.400
And they are actually able to update it like an iPhone game or something with new levels

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:26.400
and things like that.

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.720
I haven't ridden it since Toy Story 3 came out, but I heard there's some newer stuff

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:30.720
in there.

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:31.720
Yeah, that was really fun.

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:32.720
Keep surprised.

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.480
And then the game came out.

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:42.400
But yeah, we could totally have a mall taken over by zombies.

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.400
Like a Dead Rising ride?

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:45.400
Maybe.

01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:46.400
Perhaps.

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.840
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:52.440
Loki, what would you want to see in a video game theme park?

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.680
I don't know.

01:48:54.680 --> 01:49:01.960
I mean, I don't think it's really a good idea, actually.

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:04.360
You don't think it's a good idea?

01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:05.560
Why not, hater?

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:10.960
I guess it'd be fun to see, like, giant rabbit people dressed up as the giant rabbits or

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:11.960
whatever.

01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:14.120
That'd be kind of funny.

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:18.760
Or just imagine booth babes everywhere.

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:23.560
So you're suggesting a Hooters theme park.

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:24.800
They have a Hooters hotel.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:25.800
Why not?

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:26.800
They do.

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.560
It's the ugliest looking hotel I've ever seen.

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:33.600
Can you imagine one of those station wagons with the wood grain paneling on the outside?

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.080
Turned into a hotel.

01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:37.240
That would be the Hooters hotel.

01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:41.720
They have wood grain paneling on the outside of the hotel.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:44.320
Why?

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:45.320
I don't know.

01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.320
Why?

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.320
Because they're tacky.

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:50.400
Alright, uh, let's move on to another story.

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:52.280
Loki, what do you got for us?

01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.880
Ah, yes.

01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:55.560
Um, let's see.

01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:05.720
We were talking a little bit about, um, um, some of the stuff for, uh, what was it, uh,

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:12.800
Skyrim actually, um, the Elder Scrolls, ah, Elder Scrolls game.

01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:17.920
They were talking about some new stuff that's, um, available actually coming from the Game

01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:18.920
Informer magazine.

01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:21.560
They have a little piece on it in their new issue.

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:26.600
Some of the differences are going to be in this game as compared to Oblivion, for example.

01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:30.560
Um, one is going to be the way that the game actually levels.

01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:35.200
The player's levels are now going to be more balanced, um, because I guess actually in

01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:39.960
the game, much like Fallout 3 and that kind of stuff, as you level up, the enemies level

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:40.960
up as well.

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:46.320
Well, in Oblivion, it got to the point where it was pretty damn impossible to be, um, able

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:50.840
to go up against some of the enemies because they would just be leveling up with you.

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.080
I don't like role-playing games where they level completely up with you.

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:57.840
I think at some point you have to be able to overpower them a little bit.

01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:58.840
A little bit.

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:03.960
I do agree that it should be a difficulty setting, if something like that.

01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:08.160
Um, anyways, they're going to have a, it's going to scale, you know, to the player's

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.840
level, but it's going to be more balanced, they're saying.

01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:17.840
Um, it says, uh, foes will likely be easily bested by using, um, you know, some of the

01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:21.920
new features in the game, like dual-wielding, I guess is going to be a new feature that

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:22.920
they're going to have.

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:28.760
You can equip any item or spell to either hand using both simultaneously in combat.

01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:31.160
Um, so that's pretty cool.

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:41.800
Um, and then of course, uh, they were saying that, um, I guess, uh, also the leveling system,

01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:46.400
they're saying, uh, no longer binds players to classifying by a set of skills.

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:53.760
It says, players can pick and choose from the game's 18 abilities, um, which level up

01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:59.000
while using them simultaneously, unlocking perks with each level.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.600
So it basically sounds like it's going to be Fallout.

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:05.520
And then they're also going to have, yeah, and then they're going to also include, uh,

01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:10.840
new weapon crafting systems, improved character creation tools, etc.

01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:14.920
And that's pretty cool, character creation-wise, because I believe they're, uh, their tools

01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:16.600
are pretty impressive in Oblivion.

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:20.400
The only problem I found with Oblivion though, is I can create any character I want, as long

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:25.440
as they were butt-fucking-ugly, because that's all that that, that tool creates, is really

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:28.280
ugly-looking people.

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:30.560
You know, the Fallout one isn't much better, to be honest.

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:34.560
I don't know how much you've played around in Fallout 3, but, uh, a lot of the characters

01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:36.360
are, are fugs there too.

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.440
So, sorry to say.

01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:42.760
Uh, by the way, SolarFlare reminds me in chat room, like FF8, Rob?

01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:45.920
Yes, exactly like that.

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:51.800
Alright, um, one more story for you guys, then we're going to get to List List tonight.

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:52.800
I'm so excited.

01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:53.800
I haven't even told you guys the topic.

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:56.800
I think it's a fun topic tonight, but if you were paying attention earlier in the show,

01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:57.800
we dropped a hint.

01:52:57.800 --> 01:52:58.800
Yep.

01:52:58.800 --> 01:52:59.800
So maybe you figured it out.

01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:02.480
And I finally got a guest for us, and it's an exciting guest that we haven't had on the

01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:03.480
show in a while.

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:04.480
Yep.

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.480
So, uh, we'll get to that in a minute.

01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:10.640
Uh, want to go to this story about EA pulling the plug on some old games.

01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:14.440
That's right, the servers are getting shut down for some old games, because that fee

01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:19.000
you pay to use Xbox Live, well, it doesn't pay to keep old shit running.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.800
Now, the good news is, most of this stuff is old sports games.

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:26.000
You know, games that have been replaced with newer versions.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.280
For example, NCAA Basketball, 08 and 09, gone.

01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:36.760
NCAA Football, 07, 08, 09 in 2010, gone, at least the 2010 version on the PS2, specifically.

01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:39.280
NHL 08 and 09, they're out as well.

01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:41.660
So it's mostly old sports games.

01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:48.600
It also impacts series like Madden, Fight Night Round 3, FIFA, some of those games.

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.640
But they weren't the only ones impacted.

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:56.280
If you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings, the Battle for Middle Earth, 1 or 2 on PC,

01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:58.080
those servers are gone.

01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:03.440
Closing next week, Battle for Middle Earth 2 on Xbox 360, as well as the Rise of the

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:05.700
Witch King, which I guess was the expansion.

01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:07.640
Not the Lich King, guys, the Witch King.

01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:08.640
There's a difference.

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:13.720
Also, closing on January 17th, The Sims Carnival.

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:17.440
So if you were a Sims Carnival fan, but there must not have been that many of you, because

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:21.400
EA's shutting the server down, you will not be able to play anymore after January 17th.

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:24.240
And there's this contingent out there going, there was a Sims Carnival?

01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:25.240
Exactly.

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:29.740
Now, February 8th is when most of the sports games are scheduled to close.

01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:32.180
To be honest, this is nothing new.

01:54:32.180 --> 01:54:35.640
You know, it's always a bummer when it's games that aren't really sports games that upgrade

01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:39.080
every year, but, you know, it's kind of inevitable.

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:43.160
And again, they feel like they can pull the plug because you're not playing them.

01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:47.000
But for those people that game on a budget and buy old games used, because, you know,

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.320
you can get, like, last year's sports games super cheap.

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:51.320
For a song.

01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:52.320
I know.

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.320
It's super cheap.

01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:55.800
So, you know, budget gamers, that's a huge way they can kind of do it.

01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:59.040
Unfortunately, they don't get that same perk.

01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:02.760
Oh, well, what can you do?

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:04.760
Guess what it's time for, guys?

01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:05.760
Party!

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:09.000
Big American Party!

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:15.520
It's time for Listless tonight, boys and girls.

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:16.520
I'm so excited.

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:17.520
We haven't done one of these in a while.

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:22.960
The way Listless works, we are going to be forming the definitive list.

01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:25.440
And there is no arguing once this list is complete.

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:27.680
This is a very scientific method.

01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:32.960
And it involves you guys in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:35.400
We're going to bring in a fourth person to play along with us tonight.

01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:37.720
Let's get him on the line.

01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.880
I'll dumb down the music here while we give our friend a call.

01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:47.960
Now hopefully it works, because that would be a little embarrassing if it didn't work.

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:52.040
But sometimes, you know, live show and connections can be a little bit spotty.

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:53.040
Hello!

01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:54.040
Hi!

01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:55.040
Hi!

01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:57.880
Is this Breslul?

01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:58.880
It usually is.

01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:00.880
Oh, lord, hang up, Rob.

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:03.120
Long time no talk, my friend, how are you?

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:04.120
I'm kidding, kidding.

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:05.520
Happy New Year, Dark Sakura.

01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:06.520
Jeez.

01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:07.520
I'm kidding.

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:08.520
Heart, heart, heart, heart.

01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:11.120
What are your New Year's resolutions, Breslul?

01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:12.120
It doesn't matter.

01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:13.120
I've broken them all already.

01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:16.920
I did my first episode of USL, so those are all out the window.

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:17.920
Congratulations.

01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:21.360
If you don't know Breslul, not only has he guessed it on the show a little bit in the

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.360
past.

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:23.360
Not so much lately, though, sadly.

01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.760
But that's because he's too busy doing another show.

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:30.800
He's big time now, a host on Under Sedation Live, which is Saturday nights on the All

01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:32.400
Games Network.

01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:37.640
And with Iguana Girl, who's been on this show as well, Jessica Harper, Travis Donovan, who

01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:39.200
I'm afraid to have on this show.

01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:42.280
Oh, but Rob's never been on Under Sedation Live, has he?

01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:43.280
That's where I grew up.

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:44.800
That was my old stomping grounds.

01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:48.440
Apparently, this is our 10th year doing it, and we didn't even realize it.

01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:49.440
Wow.

01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:53.180
And here I was talking about OLR celebrating the 400th episode.

01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:55.120
But you know, USL is taking a lot of breaks.

01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:56.520
I don't even know if they've gotten up to 400.

01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:57.520
I hate to say it, DMN.

01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:58.520
I don't know.

01:56:58.520 --> 01:56:59.520
Whoa, hey.

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:00.520
Blast from the past there.

01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:01.520
Oh, sorry, Breslul.

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:02.520
Because I'm looking at...

01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:03.520
Never mind.

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.800
I don't want to say, but I'm looking at something and it still says the old name.

01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:07.800
DDRFreak?

01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:08.800
No.

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:09.800
Yes, I'm reading DDRFreak still.

01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.200
I was just looking at all the porn posts today.

01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:13.200
All right.

01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:18.200
Hey, I wanted to have you on specifically to talk about USL madness.

01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:19.440
Yes.

01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:22.960
We extended the deadline because not a lot of people submitted.

01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:29.280
Basically, what you do is you get a list of your 25 most favorite video games of all time.

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:34.600
They can be as far back as Atari 2600 and television, and they can be as modern as Xbox

01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:36.460
360, PS3, PC.

01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:38.220
They can even be your favorite arcade games.

01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:42.640
We actually have had one nomination for Skee-Ball, believe it or not.

01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:43.640
Okay.

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:44.640
Yeah.

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:45.640
Good choice, actually.

01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:46.640
Skee-Ball's pretty awesome.

01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:50.100
But basically, what you do is you get that list together, order it from one to 25, one

01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:53.920
being Super Metroid, 25 being Minecraft or something.

01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:58.000
I like how you told everybody what to make their number ones.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Your number one, you're just going to put Super Metroid next to it because otherwise

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
you're crazy.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Yeah.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.320
Then you submit those to uslmadness at gmail.com.

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:09.000
Voting, actually, we extended it a week.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:14.120
It closes tonight at midnight Pacific, which is, if you're listening live, less than four

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:15.120
hours from now.

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:18.240
All right, procrastinators, I expect the live listeners to get cracking.

01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:19.620
Do you accept partial lists?

01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:24.040
What if somebody's like, I can't get to 25, but I've got 10, would you take that?

01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:29.600
I will do that, but those games won't get as good consideration as if you do a full

01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:30.600
list.

01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:36.080
So then you need to just throw in some bullshit, like Mappy, throw in... I was trying to get

01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:37.080
Dark Soccer.

01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:38.080
Elevator action!

01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:39.080
What's that?

01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:43.120
Some people have thrown out Minecraft, and Minecraft's currently in the top 30.

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.120
Wow.

01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:45.120
Yeah.

01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:49.400
Minecraft's in the top 30, Pac-Man's in the top 30, Fallout might get a one seed this

01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:50.400
year.

01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.400
Wow.

01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:52.400
That's how nuts it is.

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:53.400
Nice.

01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:55.480
Now, DDR Dollar Bill's in the chat room saying, fuck Minecraft.

01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:59.040
So DDR Dollar Bill, that means you better get your list in so you can bump Minecraft

01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:00.040
down a little bit.

01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:01.040
Yeah.

01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:03.320
And then we will announce the brackets sometime this coming week.

01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:07.080
All right, uslmadness at gmail.com.

01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:09.080
Super Metroid's a one seed, right?

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:10.080
No.

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:11.080
What?

01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:12.080
It's a two seed right now.

01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:13.080
What?

01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:14.080
Yeah, I know.

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:18.120
This whole contest is a sham.

01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:19.480
I know your listeners are insane.

01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:20.480
I'm not sure which.

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:22.480
All right, you ready to play listless with us tonight?

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:23.480
I am.

01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:26.960
I actually have a list ready of something that I don't know anything about.

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:27.960
All right.

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:28.960
So here we go.

01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:30.600
Because I don't tell you the topics in advance.

01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:32.880
That would never happen in the magic of radio.

01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:33.880
All right.

01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:35.640
Let's tell the listeners already what the topic is.

01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:36.640
All right.

01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:39.840
If you were listening in part A, I said pay attention when Loki did the story about THQ

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:43.720
and Mattel are entering a game deal, which means we might get a Masters of the Universe

01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:45.000
video game.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.080
So we thought, you know what we should do?

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:52.080
Let's talk about toys that we think ought to be video games because, you know, if we

01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:56.240
limited it to just Mattel, I don't know what's Mattel and what's not, like Barbie's Mattel,

01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:57.240
right?

01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:58.240
I don't know.

01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:03.320
So we're going to just say toys in general, board games, whatever, anything you can find

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:08.880
in the toy aisle at Target or Walmart or Toys R Us, I should say is fair game, except for

02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:09.960
like diapers.

02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:11.940
Like I don't think they should make a video game out of diapers.

02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:13.640
So if you guys have diapers on your list, please remove them.

02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:16.120
It has to be an actual marketed toy item.

02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:17.440
Yes, it needs to be a toy.

02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:19.160
So Babies R Us items don't count.

02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:20.160
All right, everybody.

02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:22.360
Now chat room, here's what you guys need to do.

02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:26.320
You need to start suggesting things in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com because

02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:31.080
if one of the hosts ends up duplicating something, we usually turn to chat to figure out how

02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:34.200
to fill in the gaps there.

02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:38.080
Also the chat plays a very important part in this because what's going to happen, we're

02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:42.160
going to go around and everybody's going to name their top three, myself, Loki Dark Sakura

02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:44.660
and Bresloh will each name their top three.

02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:48.260
Then each of us will go around and take one item off of the list.

02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:50.360
Something will not be worthy of the list.

02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:54.580
That will leave us with a list of eight and you guys in our chat room vote to come up

02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:56.080
with a definitive list of three.

02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:00.600
I know that sounds really complicated you guys, but that's why it's a scientific process.

02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:02.160
Science is hard y'all.

02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:04.080
All right.

02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:05.080
Be careful guys.

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:08.160
We're about to try science.

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:10.000
She blinded me with science.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.440
All right, let's get into the list.

02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:14.000
Why don't we start tonight?

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000
How about Loki?

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.360
I don't know how often you start in listless, but tonight you're starting this listless.

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:22.200
What toy ought to be a video game?

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:29.000
This is a terrible, terrible answer, but I'm going to do it anyways because it's simple.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
It's simple.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Ball.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Ball.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Ball.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Okay.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:39.200
Tell us how the game ball works.

02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:40.280
Really can be anything.

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.640
You see balls are very versatile toys.

02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:46.760
You can play whatever games you want with them.

02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:47.760
Ball.

02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:52.920
Press A to bounce.

02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:56.640
It'd be like one of those reverse sandbox games or something.

02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:02.160
It's Minecraft, but with balls.

02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:03.880
I can see the commercial now.

02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:05.280
Come play with our balls.

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:06.480
All right.

02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:07.480
I'll go next.

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:08.480
My number three choice.

02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.080
My number three choice for game or toy they should make into a game.

02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:15.160
Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven.

02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:18.520
That was on my list and I removed it, Rob.

02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:20.620
All right.

02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:21.620
So Cooking Mama.

02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:23.640
Wouldn't that be in the reverse though?

02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:24.720
What do you mean?

02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:30.840
They're like kind of making a video game into a toy.

02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:33.840
The toys already existed ever since I was a little girl.

02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:37.520
The Easy Bake Ovens have been around forever and now Cooking Mama is going to take that

02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:45.000
old toy and she's going to make fine cuisine with nothing but a light bulb.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.000
But no.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Don't worry, Bresl.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Mama will fix it.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.000
All right.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Oh God.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.720
You won't ever be eating poop in Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven.

02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:55.920
You might be eating mud pies though because I don't know.

02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:00.240
Haven't they made Pooping Mama yet?

02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:03.440
There's Babysitting Mama where you have to change poopy diapers.

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:04.880
I mean, you mean shake the baby?

02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:05.880
I mean, hi.

02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:06.880
All right.

02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:09.200
So Dark Sakura, what is your number three answer?

02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:10.520
Toy that ought to be a game.

02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.560
The erector set level building game.

02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:17.040
We have to build the whole thing out of erector sets and then you run your little guy through

02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:18.040
the erector set.

02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:19.040
Okay.

02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:21.680
Oh, it's kind of like a Lego game, but not because it's an erector set.

02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:22.680
Kind of a little big planet.

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:26.000
Only you build the whole thing out of erector sets.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Wow.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
All right.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Well, screw chat.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.240
They're not given the answers that come on the show.

02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:32.240
You are, Bresl.

02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:34.440
It doesn't matter if chat took them.

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.040
Here's my throwaway choice then.

02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:37.040
All right.

02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:38.040
Fine.

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:39.040
Homies.

02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:40.840
Oh God.

02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:41.840
Little homies.

02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:42.840
Those little toys.

02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:43.840
The homies.

02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:44.840
Oh no.

02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:45.840
Yeah.

02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:46.840
I haven't seen those in forever.

02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:48.760
You want to hear something ironic?

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:50.580
There was a little homies game.

02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:51.580
Was there?

02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:52.580
Yes, there was.

02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:53.580
Wow.

02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:54.580
Well, they need to do a better one.

02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:56.900
What would the homies game be Bresl?

02:03:56.900 --> 02:03:57.900
I don't know.

02:03:57.900 --> 02:03:59.040
Saints Road 3.

02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:01.600
It was a kart racing game is what it was.

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:02.880
Oh God.

02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:03.880
Screw that.

02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:04.880
They need to do it again.

02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:05.880
All right.

02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:08.960
I love some of the choices that are coming out in chat, by the way.

02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:09.960
All right.

02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:10.960
Number two pick.

02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:12.600
Loki, who brought us ball.

02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:17.800
What is your number two pick for Toy They Oughta Make Into a Video Game?

02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:20.840
If you say top, I'm coming down to Sacramento and punching you.

02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:21.840
The same what?

02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:22.840
Top.

02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:23.840
Top.

02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:25.840
No one plays at tops.

02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:26.840
No.

02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:27.840
Strag.

02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:28.840
No.

02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:29.840
No.

02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:30.840
My next one.

02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:37.480
I don't know if anyone remembers these, but they used to have these giant sets you could

02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:40.400
get called Marble Mat.

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.720
It was Domino Rally.

02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:43.720
Fuck yes.

02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:44.720
Domino Rally.

02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:45.720
Domino Rally was awesome.

02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:50.320
Now granted, I know that they have a game called Domino Rally, Mr. Domino, but that's

02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:51.320
a different thing.

02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:52.320
No.

02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:53.320
Fuck Mr. Domino.

02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:54.320
I know it's tight.

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.680
You're talking about dominoes that do loop-de-loops and all the crazy stunts, right?

02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:56.680
Yes.

02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:57.680
All right.

02:04:57.680 --> 02:04:58.680
Yeah.

02:04:58.680 --> 02:04:59.680
I support you there.

02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:00.680
You can build levels out of dominoes.

02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:01.680
Yeah.

02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:02.680
Awesome.

02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:03.680
I like that pick.

02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:04.680
Domino Rally is Logie's number two pick.

02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:05.680
I like that.

02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:12.360
My number two pick tonight, Light Bright Dance Dance Revolution.

02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:18.160
Because I can think of no better way to rave than with Light Bright.

02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:20.960
Use your Light Bright to throw sweet rave parties.

02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:21.960
Exactly.

02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:27.480
Sandstorm is already a confirmed song in Light Bright DDR, just so you all know.

02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:28.480
Oh God.

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:30.080
It'd be awesome and you know it.

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:34.880
It'd be rave and the kids would be getting high and playing their Light Bright DDR.

02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:36.520
All right.

02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:40.280
Dark Sakura, what is your number two choice for Toy They Oughta Make a Video Game?

02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:42.400
Bratz Doom.

02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:48.360
As in they're all the monsters and you have to go around shooting them with the BFG.

02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:50.120
Bratz in Doom.

02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:51.120
Bratz Doom.

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:52.600
Bratz Doom.

02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:53.600
Shoot the Bratz.

02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:54.600
All right.

02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:56.320
I like that.

02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:59.320
Would the final level have Paula Abdul because she was involved with a movie.

02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:00.320
Or no, wait.

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:01.320
She got fired from the movie, I think.

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:04.560
Dude, you have to be a special kind of stupid to get fired from the Bratz movie.

02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:09.000
Or a special kind of high.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Wall Drugs.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000
All right.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Loki.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
What is your...

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
I'm sorry.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Not Loki.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Bresloh.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
So you guys are so the same.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000
It's hard to tell you guys apart.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.400
One of you is sitting right here.

02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:20.400
All right.

02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:24.960
Bresloh, what is your number two choice for Toy They Oughta Make a Video Game?

02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:28.880
I really hope one of you three have heard of this board game, but I'm going to say Dominion.

02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:32.200
Haven't heard of it.

02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:33.760
What the hell is Dominion?

02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:37.320
It's basically a kind of reverse magic where you start out with a deck and there's a set

02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:41.920
of cards out and you pay money to buy cards and then use them later.

02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:45.360
It's kind of like Settlers of Catanesh.

02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.360
It's fun.

02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:48.240
And they should make it into an Xbox Live Arcade game.

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:49.240
So Dominion.

02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:50.240
All right.

02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:51.240
I'll take your word for it.

02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:52.240
All right.

02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:53.240
Cool story, bro.

02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:54.240
All right.

02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:55.240
Loki.

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:56.240
Cool story, bro.

02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:57.240
What's your number one...

02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:58.240
Wait.

02:06:58.240 --> 02:06:59.240
What's your number one call?

02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:07.320
Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set, Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally,

02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:10.920
Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, and Dominion.

02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:13.760
Loki, what is your number one pick?

02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:19.400
I'll take your Bratz Doom and I'll raise you Dead Rising Mole Madness.

02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:21.680
That's great.

02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:22.900
That's great.

02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:27.600
Not only do you have to fight off zombies, but you also have to find good deals on clothing

02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:31.160
and other couture.

02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:32.520
I really should have put that...

02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:33.920
What's that dating game called?

02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:37.160
I really should have put that on my list and I didn't.

02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:38.160
Girl Talk?

02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:39.160
Girl Talk.

02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:45.480
Actually, they have this really shitty looking game that I've seen at Target.

02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:46.580
It's something about like...

02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:48.700
It's called like Oops, That's the Truth or something.

02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:50.240
What the hell is this game called?

02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:55.840
It's some type of like weird party game that they're selling as an Xbox 360 game.

02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:57.320
Oh, um...

02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:58.320
Somebody's had to have heard of this.

02:07:58.320 --> 02:07:59.320
No, I know what you're talking about.

02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:00.880
It's the Truth or Lies?

02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:02.240
Yes, that game.

02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:05.800
No, it's called Truth or Bargain Bit, actually.

02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:07.280
Exactly, very soon.

02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:08.960
Alright, my number one pick.

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:12.420
I picked a serious one just like Breslöl did for his last one.

02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:16.960
My serious number one answer, Millborn on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:19.160
That would be pretty badass too.

02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:22.720
Millborn is like the best French card game ever made.

02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:27.660
It might be the only French card game ever made, but damn it, it's awesome.

02:08:27.660 --> 02:08:29.920
So Millborn, and if you have...

02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:32.400
The whole point of that game is to fuck your buddy.

02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:33.920
That's the whole point of the game.

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:34.920
Awesome.

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:37.640
I just gave us the explicit tag.

02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:38.640
Thank you very much.

02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:39.640
Good night, everybody.

02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:40.640
You're welcome.

02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:43.000
That's why you're on this show tonight, to make sure we earn the explicit rating.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:46.900
So if you've never played Millborn, it's kind of like a racing game that you do at cards,

02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:49.220
and Breslöl is right.

02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:53.640
You fuck your friends by puncturing their tires, getting them pulled over, making the

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:54.920
green lights turn red.

02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:55.920
It's awesome.

02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:57.560
I love Millborn.

02:08:57.560 --> 02:08:58.560
Alright.

02:08:58.560 --> 02:08:59.560
It's good.

02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:00.560
Let's see.

02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:01.560
Where are we going to next?

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:02.560
How about Dark Soccer?

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:03.560
What's your number one answer?

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:09.040
My Little Pony Deathmatch.

02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:10.040
I think it should be...

02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:12.840
Like they bite and get rabies and stuff.

02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:16.320
I think it should be like Derby Owners Club, but with My Little Pony where you can whip

02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:17.760
the horses when they're bad.

02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:21.140
And whichever one is last gets shot.

02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:24.040
Michael Vick presents My Little Pony Deathmatch.

02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:25.040
Okay.

02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:26.840
How about we call it...

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:27.840
Here's the name.

02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:28.840
My Little...

02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:29.840
Death Race My Little Pony.

02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:30.840
Alright.

02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:34.920
And if you pre-order now, we'll give you a year's supply of Elmer's Glue.

02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:36.520
I was thinking that.

02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:37.520
Alright.

02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:41.000
Death Race My Little Pony is Dark Soccer's number one answer.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.520
Dark Soccer, I'm noticing a trend here.

02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:45.040
I think you have some anger issues.

02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:46.520
Somebody's homicidal tonight.

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:47.520
Alright.

02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:50.640
Hello, what is your number one answer?

02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:55.600
This was mentioned in the chat, and this is basically pong on crack in board game form.

02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:56.600
Crossfire.

02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:00.120
Oh shit, I remember the commercials for those.

02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:02.400
That's the one where you have like all those steel balls, right?

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:03.400
Yeah.

02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:04.400
And you shoot...

02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:07.560
My mother would never buy me that when I was growing up.

02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:08.560
She was a bitch.

02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:09.560
My mom wouldn't buy me that either.

02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:10.560
Alright.

02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:11.560
I love my mom.

02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:13.840
There was a pimple table that used that same thing called Hyper Ball.

02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:14.840
Really?

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:15.840
Crossfire was awesome.

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:17.520
All the little boys wanted one.

02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:18.520
Probably some of the girls, too.

02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:20.080
I bet Dark Soccer wanted Crossfire, too.

02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:21.480
Yeah, my mom wouldn't get it for me.

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:22.480
Ah.

02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:23.480
But she got it for my brothers.

02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:24.480
Go figure.

02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:25.480
Our parents were all mean.

02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:27.600
Loki, did your parents buy you Crossfire?

02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:30.560
I didn't want it, but I got to play it, and it was fun.

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:31.560
Not pointless.

02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:32.560
One moment.

02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:35.360
Shoot a bunch of balls at this other thing with a ball in the middle.

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:38.040
You alright, Bresloh?

02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:41.560
Bresloh needed to put the show on hold for a minute so he could tend to some business.

02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:43.560
BRB, poopin'.

02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:47.520
Alright, well here's the list of sustains right now.

02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:54.280
Ball, Cooking Mama's Easy Bake Oven, Erector Set Level Building Game, Homies, Domino Rally,

02:10:54.280 --> 02:11:01.240
Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dominion, Dead Rising Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade,

02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:04.600
Death Race My Little Pony, and Crossfire.

02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:05.720
This is hard.

02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:07.400
We have to eliminate some of these from the list.

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:08.400
I don't know if I can.

02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:11.000
Alright, but we got, that's how it works.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.320
So Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:15.320
Homies.

02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:18.040
It's already got a game in it, it's crap.

02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:19.280
Homies is gone.

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.000
Bresloh's back from his poop.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Welcome back.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Alright.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.400
Let's see, my turn.

02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:27.400
This is hard.

02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:29.680
I don't want to eliminate any of these.

02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:32.760
I'm sorry, I hate to do this because I know the chatters probably love this one.

02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:36.600
I've got to eliminate ball because I just don't get it.

02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:39.560
What is the game?

02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:41.600
That sounds like a tech demo to me, so I'm sorry.

02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:43.720
Ball has been stricken from the list.

02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:46.000
Dark Sakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.200
Only for lack of familiarity, Dominion.

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.200
Aww.

02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:54.200
Poor Bresloh got two of them yanked from the list, but that's okay, Bresloh, because you're

02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:57.680
obviously not going to eliminate your own, so you get at least one on there.

02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:00.800
Bresloh, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:04.800
I'm going to eliminate Crossfire, I mean Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven.

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:05.800
Aww.

02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:09.160
Why are you eliminating Cooking Mama Easy Bake Oven?

02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:15.120
Because only on the guarantee that my Xbox will spit out delicious treats, which I don't

02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:17.920
think that technology is quite there yet.

02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:21.360
Not yet, not until we get the holodeck and how it makes food and everything.

02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:24.160
All right, so here's the list that our chatters are going to vote on.

02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:27.640
You're going to vote for your number one and number two pick, and you're going to send

02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:30.720
them over a private message to Skye in the chat room.

02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:33.800
Please label your number one and your number two choices, or I'm going to assume what you

02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:37.320
list first is number one and what you list second is number two.

02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:39.440
So here is the...

02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:40.520
You all right Bresloh?

02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:41.520
You need a minute?

02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:45.280
All right, so here is the list as it stands right now.

02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:51.640
Erector Set Level Building Game, Domino Rally, Light Bright DDR, Bratz Doom, Dead Rising

02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:57.640
Mall Madness, Millborn Xbox Live Arcade, Death Race My Little Pony, and Crossfire.

02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:03.240
Chatters, it's now in your hands to come up with a definitive list of the top three toys

02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:04.840
that need to be video games.

02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:10.320
And while you're at it, Bresloh, repeat the March Madness email.

02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:11.320
I will do that.

02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:15.140
It is uslmadnessatgmail.com.

02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:21.000
You have about three and a half hours to get those submissions in if you're listening on

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000
the podcast.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.960
I'm sorry, the expiration has gone past, but we will have voting up probably by the time

02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:30.040
you're listening to this.

02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:33.560
And I noticed that somebody in studio just sent you an email.

02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:37.240
I think I already did one before, but I did it again just to be safe.

02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:41.600
I don't think I got one from you, but I'm assuming that it now rides with Woklockera,

02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:42.600
so...

02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:45.600
You might be right, actually.

02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:46.600
All right.

02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:47.600
Yeah.

02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:48.600
So there you go.

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:50.040
Thank you so much for playing our dumb little game tonight, Bresloh.

02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:51.120
We really appreciate it.

02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:54.680
Best of luck with uslmadness and everything that goes on at Understation Live.

02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:56.960
Tell the others we said hi.

02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:00.460
Tell Iguana Girl I'd like to go see another D-Box movie with her at some point and have

02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:01.460
Pink Bird.

02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:02.460
Okay.

02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:03.460
All right.

02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:04.460
One more thing?

02:14:04.460 --> 02:14:05.460
Yes?

02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:06.460
Yeah.

02:14:06.460 --> 02:14:07.460
You hung up.

02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:08.460
Ass.

02:14:08.460 --> 02:14:09.460
Dude.

02:14:09.460 --> 02:14:10.460
You ass.

02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:11.460
They have Ninja Legos now.

02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:12.460
Place your vote, by the way.

02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:13.460
Right now.

02:14:13.460 --> 02:14:14.460
Send your number one and your number two choices.

02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:18.160
You have until the end of the mailbag segment to get those votes in, and I'll tell you a

02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:19.160
spoiler.

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.120
There's not a lot of emails tonight, so hurry, hurry, hurry.

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.640
But let's see what is in the email bag.

02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:29.040
We're going to open it up right now, folks.

02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:32.820
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send us your emails every week.

02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:34.280
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:37.120
Dark Soccer is going to jump in the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite

02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:38.120
emails for you all.

02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:39.540
How about the one email we got?

02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:40.540
One email?

02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:41.540
Holy shit.

02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:42.540
It's a big in, though.

02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:43.540
You better get those votes in now.

02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:49.360
Well, it actually is from Rababa, picking apart an Ars Technica story about Nintendo

02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:52.240
warning about the 3D for young gamers.

02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:54.800
So I'm going to read the email as is.

02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:59.880
First they claim that eye growth as literally translated may be harmed according to a warning

02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:01.480
statement for the 3DS.

02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:05.400
They state that it isn't about actual growth, but rather perception.

02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:11.300
The concern is that the portions of our visual system that reside in the brain are adaptive.

02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:15.120
They adjust to information we receive and can remap connections in order to operate

02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:17.320
more efficiently on a typical input.

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:21.280
This is especially true in infants as the visual system is still developing at the earliest

02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:22.280
stages of life.

02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:23.280
Which is true.

02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:29.120
Babies can't see much of anything for the first few weeks, except blurs.

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:33.920
This ability to rewire our visual system on the fly is behind the 3D health concerns.

02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:39.040
I actually don't know if what they state is true, but it does seem made up to me.

02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:42.520
I wish it said according to this article in the Lancet or the like.

02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:43.520
I wish it...

02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:47.560
And I find it odd that they forget about the common eye disorder, lazy eye, where muscles

02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:51.040
in one eye don't grow, causing a seemingly cross eye.

02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:55.360
This treatment is remarkably simple, wearing an eye patch to exercise the weaker eye.

02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:58.760
I always assumed the warning was for conditions like lazy eye.

02:15:58.760 --> 02:15:59.760
What do you think?

02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:04.960
Also, isn't the warning more about what we don't know about simulated 3D effects?

02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:08.600
I'm sure that there will also be warnings to stop using 3D if you develop nausea or

02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:09.600
headache.

02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:12.320
Either way, it must be better than the red-blue 3D.

02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:13.640
Later, Ra-ba-ba.

02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:17.440
Sigh and magenta.

02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:21.080
You know, and I think we got into this a little bit last week on the show with the disclaimer,

02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:25.320
but you know, I think it's just Nintendo kind of overcompensating a little bit, where it's

02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:28.600
just that we live in a soo-happy society.

02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:29.600
They're covering their ass.

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:34.640
Yeah, and I think a kid would have to play these games for a very long time.

02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:39.200
But I'll admit, when I was playing the 3DS, I did feel that little pull on my eyes.

02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:42.320
But you know, when it got to me, I just would turn the slider off.

02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:46.240
So it's really about just kind of knowing your limits, I suppose, and knowing when to

02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:47.240
turn that off.

02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:50.920
Now, I guess a child wouldn't really know their limits, but that's why parents have

02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:55.080
to supervise you guys.

02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:59.120
So I don't know, I don't know what else to say on that.

02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:00.120
Anything else for that email?

02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:01.120
DarkSagra?

02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:02.120
Nope.

02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:03.120
Wow.

02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:04.120
Alright.

02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:05.120
I'm still tallying cage match votes.

02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:06.120
Well...

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:07.120
Listless votes?

02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:08.720
Sorry, that's what I meant.

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:09.720
Listless votes.

02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:10.720
Cage matches for after.

02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:11.720
Yeah, sorry.

02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:12.720
My bad.

02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:13.720
Listless votes.

02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:14.720
I'm still tabulating right now.

02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:17.440
And two of these have very similar names that I keep mistaking.

02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:21.120
See, I just gave one a vote that I shouldn't have, because it was a vote for Death Race,

02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:22.120
not Dead Rising.

02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:23.120
Dead!

02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:24.120
Alright.

02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:27.440
This is the very, very last call.

02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:30.520
If you don't get those votes in now, they may not count, because we have to move into

02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:32.140
the FUs of the week.

02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:37.280
It's the part of the show where we get angsty.

02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:52.840
FU to my hip.

02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:56.640
For hurting like a motherfucker all week.

02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:58.440
And keeping me from doing fun things.

02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:04.080
However, I have leveled quite a bit in World of Warcraft, and FU did that too.

02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:05.080
Loki?

02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:07.080
Um, FU to my shoulder.

02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:11.640
I must have slept on it weird or something last night, because it's been hurting the

02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:15.020
hell out of me today, so that really sucks.

02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:18.160
Are you sure that your child hasn't learned how to climb out of the crib and come chew

02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:19.160
on your shoulder?

02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:20.160
No.

02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:22.240
He tried to eat my nose last night, though, so it's possible.

02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:23.240
All babies are always sticking things in their mouths.

02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:26.360
I don't know if you saw the picture on Facebook Nellie posted.

02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:27.360
That picture was great.

02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:32.020
It was like some de- he just like all of a sudden started attacking my nose, it was funny.

02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:33.020
It's something!

02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:34.020
Bite!

02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:36.640
These babies are cute.

02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:40.280
Until they get three and decide to jump on you and break your back.

02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:42.160
And then they're still cute.

02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:49.800
Yeah, the way that I hurt my hip is catching Becky's son Julian, because now he's falling

02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:52.360
with style on top of people.

02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:57.560
Like in Toy Story, anyway.

02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:03.660
All right, my FU of the week goes to, um, people that are always negative all the time.

02:19:03.660 --> 02:19:07.160
People that just live in this negative little world with their negative little comments,

02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:09.320
they never have anything good to say.

02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:12.320
Geez, Rob, you're complaining a lot.

02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:13.320
Shut up!

02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:14.320
That was negative, too!

02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:15.320
No, but I'm serious.

02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:20.760
It's like, I just say there's, there's certain fun things that I like to do and the amount

02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:23.660
of negativity surrounding them is starting to suck the fun out of it.

02:19:23.660 --> 02:19:24.660
And it really is.

02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:27.140
It's nothing any of you are involved with, don't worry about it.

02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:30.900
So it's kind of one of those things where I'm like starting to get to my wits end and

02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:34.980
it's kind of like I, I might have to give it up because it's not fun anymore.

02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:35.980
I get it.

02:19:35.980 --> 02:19:36.980
It's a bummer.

02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:37.980
It's nothing to do with podcasting, y'all.

02:19:37.980 --> 02:19:38.980
Don't start rumors.

02:19:38.980 --> 02:19:39.980
Or Warcraft.

02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:40.980
So it's just frustrating.

02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:41.980
Yeah.

02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:42.980
Anyhow, drama.

02:19:42.980 --> 02:19:50.420
There's always drama somewheres, but let's, let's make things a little bit happier and

02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:53.460
get into the listless results.

02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:54.460
Yay!

02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:56.460
Results of tonight's listless.

02:19:56.460 --> 02:19:57.540
This is it.

02:19:57.540 --> 02:19:58.800
This is the definitive list.

02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:02.060
You guys, Oh, we've got a late vote.

02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:03.820
I almost would not let this count.

02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:06.460
However, I don't think it's going to change the final result here.

02:20:06.460 --> 02:20:08.020
No, it does not.

02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:09.020
All right.

02:20:09.020 --> 02:20:10.580
The top three, and this is it guys.

02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:11.800
There is no disputing.

02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:15.660
These are the three games you want to see them make out of toys.

02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:18.060
Number three tonight, and it was a close one.

02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:21.180
Number three tonight was death race.

02:20:21.180 --> 02:20:22.180
My little pony.

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:23.180
Yay.

02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:27.860
We want those ponies to fight to the death.

02:20:27.860 --> 02:20:34.780
Your number two pick for game you most want to see them make out of an old toy, Crossfire.

02:20:34.780 --> 02:20:35.780
That's going to be interesting.

02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:36.780
I don't know how that would be a video game.

02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:37.780
You should find the commercial for Crossfire, Rob.

02:20:37.780 --> 02:20:39.580
Didn't it have like a catchy little theme song to it?

02:20:39.580 --> 02:20:40.580
I think it did.

02:20:40.580 --> 02:20:41.580
Hold on.

02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:42.580
Let me put that in and chat.

02:20:42.580 --> 02:20:43.580
Let me see if I can YouTube it real quick.

02:20:43.580 --> 02:20:44.580
Here.

02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:45.580
Hold on.

02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:54.340
It was retarded and funny at the same time and it like had this like red and blue background.

02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:55.340
Hold on.

02:20:55.340 --> 02:20:56.340
Hold on kids.

02:20:56.340 --> 02:20:57.340
Here we go.

02:20:57.340 --> 02:20:58.340
Coming soon to a video game store near you.

02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:27.100
The ultimate challenge, Crossfire.

02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:28.660
I found one of those at a thrift store.

02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:29.860
God, the eighties were amazing.

02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:32.220
Rob, with the label on it, missing balls.

02:21:32.220 --> 02:21:35.140
It was like a year ago.

02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:36.620
This game has no balls.

02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:37.780
All right.

02:21:37.780 --> 02:21:43.140
And the number one game or sorry, number one toy you most want to see turned into a game.

02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:44.140
Come on.

02:21:44.140 --> 02:21:45.140
You guys know our audience.

02:21:45.140 --> 02:21:46.140
What is it?

02:21:46.140 --> 02:21:48.140
Light, bright DDR.

02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:49.140
Yay.

02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:53.420
Everyone get out the E in the sandstorm.

02:21:53.420 --> 02:21:54.980
Everyone rave.

02:21:54.980 --> 02:21:55.980
Coming soon.

02:21:55.980 --> 02:21:56.980
Hugs.

02:21:56.980 --> 02:21:57.980
Everybody hugs.

02:21:57.980 --> 02:21:58.980
Hugs.

02:21:58.980 --> 02:22:01.900
I made some candy cause you're my friend.

02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:04.380
You guys let's hug.

02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:07.060
Can we cuddle?

02:22:07.060 --> 02:22:08.580
And then there's the make out room.

02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:11.660
No, it's the, it's the cuddle room.

02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:12.660
It's not the make out room.

02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:14.100
Oh, you know, that's what it's going to turn into.

02:22:14.100 --> 02:22:17.640
Did you ever go to like, I want to say you went to one, like I still remember we both

02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:18.640
went to one or something.

02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:26.820
No, I went to a roller skate rave and really, well we got permission to.

02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:32.900
We rented, this is in Alabama, mind you, we rented a roller rink and my roommate at the

02:22:32.900 --> 02:22:40.280
time DJ'd the whole thing and it was like, like the, the dance music of that day, like

02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:45.500
Psychosonic and Tracy Lords and Moby and all of that cause you know Tracy Lords did her

02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:46.500
stint as a DJ.

02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:47.500
I love Tracy Lords.

02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:48.500
I'm not even going to lie.

02:22:48.500 --> 02:22:49.500
Oh yeah.

02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:58.020
Um, you know, and a sunscreen and all of those, you know, uh, mid nineties dance music and

02:22:58.020 --> 02:23:03.380
there was activities going on in the outside cause we couldn't do anything inside the rink.

02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:09.460
Sorry, we needed a soundtrack to this, but we had people in various states of intoxication

02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:11.540
on roller skates.

02:23:11.540 --> 02:23:12.540
It was amazing.

02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:15.300
Loki, did you ever go to a rave when you were younger?

02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:22.180
Um, no, but I had to clean up a rave and that's not, not much fun.

02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:32.660
Apparently they, they got the good idea to, um, host a rave at the Cuzar and most people,

02:23:32.660 --> 02:23:41.420
I guess there was an orgy on the T-MEC machine and there was also an orgy on the, uh, hard

02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:43.740
driving machine, I think.

02:23:43.740 --> 02:23:45.500
The nap machine.

02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:50.020
Anyways so they had that, but people started having an orgy in the hard drive and I don't

02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:51.020
know.

02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:52.020
I wasn't there.

02:23:52.020 --> 02:23:56.220
Um, but anyways, see people were paying money to go inside the arena.

02:23:56.220 --> 02:23:58.540
They weren't even really playing laser tag.

02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:01.900
They were just staring at the colors from all the black lights.

02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:06.860
So uh, yeah, I missed out on that unfortunately, but I got to come in and clean it up afterwards

02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:07.860
and that sucked.

02:24:07.860 --> 02:24:08.860
How exciting for you.

02:24:08.860 --> 02:24:10.600
I went to, I went to two raves.

02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:13.380
I had a really good friend of mine when I was younger was really into the whole rave

02:24:13.380 --> 02:24:16.340
thing and one of them was kind of dumb.

02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:17.660
Like I didn't have a good time at that rave.

02:24:17.660 --> 02:24:21.580
It was, it was like a house that was like a recording studio that whatever.

02:24:21.580 --> 02:24:25.540
Keep in mind y'all, I went to school in Chico, California, which is like party central.

02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:28.100
Like everything you've read about, about Chico being a party school.

02:24:28.100 --> 02:24:29.100
Totally true.

02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:34.620
So uh, yeah, so that rave was kind of dopey, but the other one was like an outdoor kind

02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:35.620
of thing.

02:24:35.620 --> 02:24:38.740
I don't even know where it was cause I wasn't watching where we were driving and I had a

02:24:38.740 --> 02:24:39.740
lot of fun.

02:24:39.740 --> 02:24:40.740
I have to, I'm not going to lie.

02:24:40.740 --> 02:24:44.300
I had a lot, you know, for being like the E for being 20 I didn't do any of that.

02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:48.660
And actually everybody really respected my wishes to not get into doing to any of that.

02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:50.260
But um, I'm not going to lie.

02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:54.780
Um, there was this guy who I think might've had some of the substances was really hot

02:24:54.780 --> 02:24:55.940
and we just made out all night.

02:24:55.940 --> 02:24:59.420
Like I didn't, I didn't need nothing to get me in the mood.

02:24:59.420 --> 02:25:00.420
I'm like, you're hot.

02:25:00.420 --> 02:25:02.260
That's drug enough for me.

02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:04.460
Oh Rob.

02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:05.460
So that was the day.

02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:08.500
And then actually I kissed a girl at that same wave.

02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:10.580
I know because she's okay.

02:25:10.580 --> 02:25:12.420
This has nothing to do with games, but I don't even care.

02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:13.740
This is funny.

02:25:13.740 --> 02:25:19.200
She took this book or she had this book of everybody she'd ever made out with was in

02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:20.620
this book.

02:25:20.620 --> 02:25:26.560
And uh, she was on page 67 and I said, I want to be page 69 in your book.

02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:28.260
Like I have to like, this is my new goal.

02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:30.100
I want to be page 69 in your book.

02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:33.540
And she's like, well, I'll make out with you, but I have to have 68 first.

02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:36.500
So I was like, you make out with her.

02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:41.260
And so she made out with this random guy and then made out with me.

02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:45.380
And then, uh, I was number 69 and then this is so terrible.

02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:47.080
You guys don't do this at home.

02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:52.000
Then we decided we were all three going to kiss and that's when I got introduced to three

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.820
way kissing, which is really weird.

02:25:53.820 --> 02:26:03.720
Yeah, it's, it's, there's certain things I can't say with my husband and the other.

02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:07.220
So that was my, um, raving experience.

02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:12.180
So it was a good time, you know, I've, I've just done the wrong and silly and you know

02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:13.180
what it was.

02:26:13.180 --> 02:26:14.180
It wasn't sex.

02:26:14.180 --> 02:26:15.180
It was just kissing.

02:26:15.180 --> 02:26:16.180
I've done the roller rave.

02:26:16.180 --> 02:26:17.180
Yeah.

02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:22.780
The roller rave was fun cause I drank a lot of beer and I can roller skate drunk.

02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:25.780
Alrighty, let's move on.

02:26:25.780 --> 02:26:28.660
Do not drink and roller skate.

02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:30.940
It is a bigger disaster than drinking and driving.

02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:34.340
Let's try to get back into some actual video game news.

02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:35.340
I don't know.

02:26:35.340 --> 02:26:36.740
Unless Loki wants to talk about three way kissing.

02:26:36.740 --> 02:26:40.300
I don't know, but I have no experience in that I'm afraid.

02:26:40.300 --> 02:26:42.300
Well then I guess we'll have to go back to video game news.

02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:49.380
I guess we're going to have to, um, so there was concern with, uh, harmonics being sold

02:26:49.380 --> 02:26:54.860
by, uh, MTV, you know, who was going to buy them, you know, was it going to be Activision?

02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:59.860
God, let's hope it's not Activision, but, uh, ironically enough, no one ever thought

02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:03.900
harmonics may buy harmonics and that's what happened.

02:27:03.900 --> 02:27:10.940
Um, apparently our harmonics, um, they've been purchased and they have a investment

02:27:10.940 --> 02:27:11.940
group.

02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:14.940
Uh, Columbus Nova also, um, took part in that.

02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:19.860
They purchased them for $49 and 99 cents plus whatever debt they had.

02:27:19.860 --> 02:27:28.700
So, um, apparently they're going to, um, you know, take on their debts and stuff.

02:27:28.700 --> 02:27:35.420
But, uh, harmonics will assume, uh, responsibility over its liabilities and also, um, includes,

02:27:35.420 --> 02:27:40.900
um, music rights, fees, and responsibilities for lots of unsold games and equipment sitting

02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:42.420
on warehouse shelves.

02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:49.100
Also, they're going to be able to, um, keep the rights to Rock Band and Dent Central.

02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:51.820
And, um, we'll have control over those franchises.

02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:54.020
So that's kind of cool.

02:27:54.020 --> 02:27:56.140
And Viacom's not doing too bad out of it.

02:27:56.140 --> 02:28:02.020
Apparently the sale will reportedly net Viacom $150 million in tax benefits and, uh, you

02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:05.820
know, considering it spent $175 million to buy the company in the first place, that's

02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:06.820
not bad.

02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:07.820
Wow.

02:28:07.820 --> 02:28:12.940
So they're going to, uh, write off essentially on their taxes this year, Viacom, or I mean,

02:28:12.940 --> 02:28:13.940
I, uh, harmonics.

02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:15.740
Viacom will write them off.

02:28:15.740 --> 02:28:16.740
Wow.

02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:17.740
Crazy.

02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:22.620
I just hope that they can get the backing that they'll need to keep up, uh, with, you

02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:24.700
know, production and licensing and everything.

02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:29.700
Where's the commercial on YouTube that's all QVC style where you can buy a video game publishing

02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:35.000
company for $49.99 and the chicks who have no idea what they're talking about trying

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000
to explain it.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.160
Have you ever watched them sell video games on QVC?

02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:40.340
It makes my brain hurt.

02:28:40.340 --> 02:28:41.860
It's so awesomely bad.

02:28:41.860 --> 02:28:43.380
I don't watch TV, Rob.

02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:44.380
Oh my God.

02:28:44.380 --> 02:28:45.380
That should be a segment on our show.

02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:46.380
I just watch Supernatural.

02:28:46.380 --> 02:28:47.720
We're hard up for new segments on our show.

02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:53.080
We need to start doing like QVC selling video games because it's, it's hilarious how bad

02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:54.180
they are.

02:28:54.180 --> 02:29:00.180
This game is called Shock Troopers and I think it's about getting electrocuted in the jungle

02:29:00.180 --> 02:29:02.300
while you're shooting guns.

02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:03.300
Yeah.

02:29:03.300 --> 02:29:07.700
This is a really fun game for the whole family.

02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:09.900
And this game is called Resident Evil.

02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:11.260
It's not bloody at all.

02:29:11.260 --> 02:29:12.660
There's no zombies.

02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:16.260
For you auto aficionados out here, Grand Theft Auto is perfect for you.

02:29:16.260 --> 02:29:19.340
It has lots of cars in it and hookers.

02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:22.900
I want to see really quick.

02:29:22.900 --> 02:29:24.260
Do they have any on YouTube?

02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:25.260
Hold on.

02:29:25.260 --> 02:29:27.340
You know they've got everything on YouTube, Rob.

02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:29.620
You're not going to have a problem.

02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:32.020
Although if you don't find anything, I will be surprised.

02:29:32.020 --> 02:29:36.660
And there was the one, the guy who broke the TV with the Wiimote on QVC.

02:29:36.660 --> 02:29:37.660
Really?

02:29:37.660 --> 02:29:40.660
That was pretty funny.

02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:45.300
Um, QVC Phineas and Ferb motion video game.

02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:48.500
Phineas and Ferb is awesome.

02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:52.340
I don't, this isn't actually a clip from QVC though.

02:29:52.340 --> 02:29:53.340
I don't know.

02:29:53.340 --> 02:29:54.340
Sadly I don't.

02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:55.340
Good chat room.

02:29:55.340 --> 02:29:56.340
You need to find me one so I can play it here on the show.

02:29:56.340 --> 02:29:57.340
Okay.

02:29:57.340 --> 02:29:58.340
We got one more story for you guys.

02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:03.620
Then we're going to open up the, uh, uh, 877 number 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype

02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:04.620
is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:30:04.620 --> 02:30:10.820
Ooh, actually I need to make sure that, uh, the 800 number is still working because, uh,

02:30:10.820 --> 02:30:13.740
it actually may have ran out tonight and I forgot to recharge it.

02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:16.700
So you may only be able to get us on Skype tonight at OrangeLoungeRadio, but I'll try

02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:17.700
in a minute here.

02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:22.060
Uh, first off though, we've got to get to news about the new Silent Hill.

02:30:22.060 --> 02:30:26.160
There's a new Silent Hill game coming and it's called, not Silent Hill 8, it's called

02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:28.100
Silent Hill Downpour.

02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:29.260
Yep.

02:30:29.260 --> 02:30:32.100
That's the new name of the game, Silent Hill Downpour.

02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:35.360
There's new information about this game in the latest Game Informer.

02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:39.100
Apparently the town is huge and you're going to use a subway system to get from one parts

02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:40.460
of the town to another.

02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:44.500
There's going to be a never before seen Southeastern side of Silent Hill.

02:30:44.500 --> 02:30:47.180
There is no hospitals or schools in that area.

02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:48.180
Hmm.

02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:49.180
So they're trying something new.

02:30:49.180 --> 02:30:52.460
Uh, there will be optional side quests apparently in the game as well.

02:30:52.460 --> 02:30:56.020
Uh, combat will be from more like the earlier Silent Hill games.

02:30:56.020 --> 02:31:00.340
You can avoid a lot of encounters and it's advised to avoid encounters.

02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:03.840
You can only carry one melee weapon at a time, such as an axe.

02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:06.780
The enemies are very hard to kill, the weapons break easily.

02:31:06.780 --> 02:31:11.300
The only fights you have to do in the game are boss battles.

02:31:11.300 --> 02:31:13.380
Water is going to be an essential part of the game.

02:31:13.380 --> 02:31:17.260
Uh, there's apparently a room in the game that has upside down running water on the

02:31:17.260 --> 02:31:18.260
ceiling.

02:31:18.260 --> 02:31:22.580
Uh, puzzles will be back to scaling difficulty levels so you can have easy puzzles or super

02:31:22.580 --> 02:31:23.740
hard puzzles.

02:31:23.740 --> 02:31:26.540
So that's kind of cool because it sounds like they're going back to their roots a little

02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:27.540
bit.

02:31:27.540 --> 02:31:31.580
But it sounds like they're mixing a little bit of old Silent Hill with open world quest

02:31:31.580 --> 02:31:35.600
driven games like, I don't know, Warcraft, Borderlands, that type of thing.

02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:38.420
So that's, um, kind of neat, I got to say.

02:31:38.420 --> 02:31:40.920
So, uh, looking forward to trying that.

02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:41.920
Hopefully that'll be at E3.

02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:46.060
Are you excited for that game at all, Dark Sakura?

02:31:46.060 --> 02:31:51.980
I was looking at the stuff for it, and I think that it's got some interesting stuff to it,

02:31:51.980 --> 02:31:52.980
so I might play it.

02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:57.980
But if it's anything at all like, um, whatever the Shattered Memories was, then no.

02:31:57.980 --> 02:32:01.860
Act Definite on our chatroom says Silent Hill Downhill, more like it.

02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:03.500
Wham wham wham wham.

02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:08.740
So is that like the last game except they're replacing the snow with lots of rain?

02:32:08.740 --> 02:32:12.260
I would have to give it a try.

02:32:12.260 --> 02:32:13.260
I would have to give it a chance.

02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:16.180
I'd have to give the other ones a chance, I'd have to give this a chance.

02:32:16.180 --> 02:32:19.380
Because I mean, Silent Hill, you know.

02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:24.740
DDR Dollar Bill says Silent Hill Signs Edition.

02:32:24.740 --> 02:32:29.980
I do like the idea of having the open universe.

02:32:29.980 --> 02:32:30.980
So maybe.

02:32:30.980 --> 02:32:31.980
Me too.

02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:34.060
Maybe that will be the redeeming factor.

02:32:34.060 --> 02:32:36.380
Who knows.

02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:38.380
What do you most want to see in a new Silent Hill game?

02:32:38.380 --> 02:32:40.660
Do you think they ought to just go back to Silent Hill 2?

02:32:40.660 --> 02:32:43.980
I want to see it produced by Konami in Japan.

02:32:43.980 --> 02:32:46.780
That's what I most want to see.

02:32:46.780 --> 02:32:52.580
That's what it needs, is to be back, they need to beg Yamaoka to come back, and they

02:32:52.580 --> 02:32:56.160
need to just get it back done the way they were doing them before.

02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.540
They were doing them well.

02:32:57.540 --> 02:32:59.420
Why did they screw up?

02:32:59.420 --> 02:33:02.060
They shouldn't have ever sent the franchise to the US.

02:33:02.060 --> 02:33:04.060
I mean as far as to be developed in the US.

02:33:04.060 --> 02:33:05.380
That's what I'm saying.

02:33:05.380 --> 02:33:07.660
It doesn't have the same feel anymore.

02:33:07.660 --> 02:33:09.160
Alright.

02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:14.380
We are going to open up the Skype line right now at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:33:14.380 --> 02:33:17.920
It does look like the number is working, but the message I think is broken.

02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:21.160
So if you call, you're not going to get that little, you've reached Orange Lounge Radio

02:33:21.160 --> 02:33:22.160
message line.

02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:24.300
I don't, it's some generic thing right now.

02:33:24.300 --> 02:33:26.500
So we'll look at that after the show, why that's going on.

02:33:26.500 --> 02:33:30.660
But otherwise, you can give us a call right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or of course our username

02:33:30.660 --> 02:33:32.120
on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:35.960
Now there is a bit of delay between live and when the folks can actually start calling,

02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:38.500
so I'll ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories.

02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:43.660
Yes, there's some new stuff developing on the 3D side of the PlayStation Network.

02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:49.500
Apparently they're going to start offering some 3D movies available on their service.

02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:58.780
And one of those 3D movies is, yes, the 3D swimsuit video via, I believe, Sports Illustrated.

02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:03.260
So you will be able to get 3D boobs on the PlayStation 3.

02:34:03.260 --> 02:34:06.140
Not quite porn, but hey, whatever.

02:34:06.140 --> 02:34:08.180
It's Cinemax style porn.

02:34:08.180 --> 02:34:09.540
Yes.

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:11.780
And then, I don't know if you've seen this yet, Rob.

02:34:11.780 --> 02:34:14.340
This is kind of scary.

02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:21.020
Another Kinect hack, some guy has actually programmed the Kinect to allow him to play

02:34:21.020 --> 02:34:28.660
around with the figure of Ivy from Soul Calibur with boob physics.

02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:33.500
Well, lack of boob physics, but, you know, Soul Calibur boob physics.

02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:37.300
So he can move around with her boobs bouncing around.

02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:38.300
Gay boob simulations.

02:34:38.300 --> 02:34:40.660
All right, we got a call coming in, so let's go to that real quick.

02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:41.900
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:42.900
Who's this?

02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:43.900
Hi.

02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:44.900
It's DDR Dollar Bill.

02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:45.900
DDR Dollar Bill.

02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:46.900
How are you doing, my friend?

02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:47.900
Yeah, I'm doing all right, man.

02:34:47.900 --> 02:34:48.900
Doing all right.

02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:49.900
All right.

02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:50.900
What's on your mind?

02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:56.020
Pretty much, I was trying to send an email out to you guys, but I was trying to do it

02:34:56.020 --> 02:34:58.220
with the website, but I kept getting rejected.

02:34:58.220 --> 02:35:00.620
So I figured, let me just call up and explain what's going on.

02:35:00.620 --> 02:35:01.620
Weird.

02:35:01.620 --> 02:35:02.620
I don't know why the website's rejecting.

02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:05.100
But, you know, the website had some major issues last week.

02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:07.580
I guess some people started spamming our photo feed.

02:35:07.580 --> 02:35:08.580
I missed it.

02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:09.580
I totally missed this.

02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:13.220
Like, actdeft and dekeman took care of it when I wasn't listening, or watching, I should

02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:14.220
say.

02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:18.180
But I guess, like, people were putting, like, weird, like, porno things in the picture feed.

02:35:18.180 --> 02:35:22.420
And you know, I threatened to pull the plug before if that shit starts happening.

02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:26.140
However, I realize there's no one that actually listens to this show's fault, but we have

02:35:26.140 --> 02:35:27.220
to keep an eye on that now.

02:35:27.220 --> 02:35:30.100
So some of the things with the website might have got tweaked because of that.

02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:31.700
Anyhow, what's on your mind?

02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:36.660
Um, pretty much, this is probably going to be the year that I'm going to really just

02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:37.660
stop gaming.

02:35:37.660 --> 02:35:38.660
Video gaming.

02:35:38.660 --> 02:35:39.660
What?

02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:40.660
Why is that?

02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:44.740
Well, the other day, a couple days ago, I was going to, I was just listening to some

02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:49.620
old Nintendo games, like some music, you know, the NSF files, the emulators.

02:35:49.620 --> 02:35:53.020
And I was just going back, like, what are some of the best things I remember about games?

02:35:53.020 --> 02:35:58.860
And quite honestly, today's games don't have any excitement to it.

02:35:58.860 --> 02:36:03.780
There's, there's nothing really exciting about playing them anymore.

02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:06.300
There's no games that get you excited anymore?

02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:07.620
What type, okay, let me ask you this.

02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:09.780
What type of old Nintendo games did you like?

02:36:09.780 --> 02:36:12.660
Ah, some memories, let's see.

02:36:12.660 --> 02:36:17.060
I actually loved the original Ninja Gaiden, for example, the trilogy.

02:36:17.060 --> 02:36:18.060
Okay.

02:36:18.060 --> 02:36:22.900
I loved that, um, Blaster Master was another popular one.

02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:26.700
I agree, that new Blaster Master game they made a little while ago wasn't nearly as good

02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:27.700
as the old one.

02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:28.700
Really unfortunate.

02:36:28.700 --> 02:36:31.260
Ooh, I haven't tried that yet.

02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:34.100
But yeah, like, um, and what was another one I tried?

02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:40.260
I mean, I can go to Genesis games, like, Phantasy Star 2, for example, it was just, those, those

02:36:40.260 --> 02:36:43.740
things that have, you know, they gave me great memories, you know, they made me want to play

02:36:43.740 --> 02:36:48.820
it through, no matter how bullshit hard it got, you know, they were just fantastic, like,

02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:49.820
those games.

02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:55.300
And recently, no game really has actually grabbed my attention.

02:36:55.300 --> 02:37:01.260
Maybe just one, but one out of, how many games get released a year, that's a bad number.

02:37:01.260 --> 02:37:04.340
Out of curiosity, what's the one game that grabbed your attention?

02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:05.340
Red Dead Redemption.

02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:07.820
Okay, well that was a pretty solid game.

02:37:07.820 --> 02:37:08.820
Interesting.

02:37:08.820 --> 02:37:12.660
And you know what, you seem to really like exploring in games, because a lot of those

02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:16.260
games you name, they all have to do something like you explore, and you find new things

02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:20.820
as you go through the world, especially something like Red Dead Redemption is, is a lot about,

02:37:20.820 --> 02:37:21.820
like, exploration.

02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:24.740
So it sounds like these kind of, like, open world games might kind of be your thing, I

02:37:24.740 --> 02:37:26.740
don't know, I'm just kind of guessing.

02:37:26.740 --> 02:37:31.980
But what about, like, new games that kind of call back that retro style, and I mean

02:37:31.980 --> 02:37:35.720
things like Bionic Commando Rearmed, we talked about earlier in the show, has a new release

02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:36.720
coming out.

02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:39.940
Super Meat Boy, awesome throwback to retro games.

02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:40.940
No interest there?

02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:45.140
Oh, okay, from, okay, for Bionic Commando Rearmed, I loved that.

02:37:45.140 --> 02:37:49.940
I, it's like, that event, I eventually beat it, and it was like, it was a satisfying experience.

02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:51.660
I really loved it.

02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:56.780
Especially since I loved Bionic Commando since the Arcade Edition, which most people are

02:37:56.780 --> 02:38:00.420
going to be like, there was an arcade?

02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:05.620
I seem to recall one, I do, and not even just the Pay Choice 10 one, I think there was actually

02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:08.340
like a, I seem to recall what you're talking about.

02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:10.340
Yeah, like that one.

02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:15.660
Super Meat Boy is actually very, very interesting case.

02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:22.540
It's, I tried a demo of it, and I liked it, but at the same time, my thoughts were, do

02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:27.580
I really want to go through the harder levels for reward that I'm not going to really enjoy?

02:38:27.580 --> 02:38:32.340
I mean, you know, it's like, am I going to play this difficult game for the sake of it

02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:36.980
being difficult, or am I going to play it because I actually enjoy it?

02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:40.620
You know, I see a comment in our chat room, and I think this is a darn good piece of advice

02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:45.600
for you, and Azam in our chat room says, someone get this man a near lethal dose of indie gaming

02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:46.820
stat.

02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:49.900
Maybe you're just fed up with what's in the mainstream in a lot of those games that, you

02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:52.620
know, cost $60 to find out a game sucks.

02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:55.940
Have you thought about turning to the indie side of things a little bit, maybe exploring

02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:59.460
a little more what Steam or the Xbox Live indie arcades have on it?

02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:02.100
Ah, that's another good point you guys bring up.

02:39:02.100 --> 02:39:05.460
You are, that's another point I was going to bring up because, yes, I've actually turned

02:39:05.460 --> 02:39:09.860
to indie gaming, and I can tell you one other game that actually really caught my interest,

02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:12.580
and I didn't really mention this, and again, I'm remembering.

02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:14.260
Amnesia, have you ever heard of it?

02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:15.260
Yes, I have.

02:39:15.260 --> 02:39:17.260
I have heard of Amnesia.

02:39:17.260 --> 02:39:19.140
Scariest fucking game I ever played in my life.

02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:20.340
Yeah, I hear it's great.

02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:23.500
I haven't played it myself yet, but I hear it's really scary.

02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:26.620
So yeah, I mean, that's a great indie game.

02:39:26.620 --> 02:39:31.100
I've heard, we've heard a lot, we had somebody on the show last week talking about VVVVV

02:39:31.100 --> 02:39:32.660
being their game of the year.

02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:36.820
I mean, Super Meat Boy of sorts is an indie game as well.

02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:39.580
There's a lot of these indie packs that are available on Steam.

02:39:39.580 --> 02:39:43.740
I don't know, you know, it's not as cheap now as they were at Christmas time, but things

02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:47.300
where you can get like, you know, kind of like a sampling of different types of games.

02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:48.300
Pretty cheap.

02:39:48.300 --> 02:39:50.420
The Humble Indie Bundle was out recently.

02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:55.020
You know, maybe there's more to look for in there, where you don't feel like you're getting

02:39:55.020 --> 02:39:58.060
as shafted with the money you're spending.

02:39:58.060 --> 02:40:01.060
Especially when it's like you can't replay much demos these days.

02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:02.060
Absolutely.

02:40:02.060 --> 02:40:03.060
You know.

02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:07.600
Well, DDR Dollar Bill, I hope you find something to kind of change your mind a little bit.

02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:11.660
You know, there's so many types of games out there, but maybe it's just not gonna be a

02:40:11.660 --> 02:40:15.300
AAA game from the developer, but at the same time, you liked Red Dead Redemption.

02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:20.840
So I wouldn't look away completely from what the mainstream's doing, because they'll be

02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:23.260
more like Red Dead soon, trust me.

02:40:23.260 --> 02:40:27.860
Yeah, I guess it's just the start of the year, so I'll give it a chance.

02:40:27.860 --> 02:40:28.860
That's true.

02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:29.860
I think it'll be okay.

02:40:29.860 --> 02:40:31.940
Alright, DDR Dollar Bill, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, but thanks for

02:40:31.940 --> 02:40:32.940
giving us a call.

02:40:32.940 --> 02:40:33.940
Good topic.

02:40:33.940 --> 02:40:34.940
No problem.

02:40:34.940 --> 02:40:35.940
Alright, take care, guys.

02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:36.940
Later, guys.

02:40:36.940 --> 02:40:37.940
Later.

02:40:37.940 --> 02:40:38.940
Alright, good call.

02:40:38.940 --> 02:40:39.940
Let's go to another one.

02:40:39.940 --> 02:40:40.940
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio.

02:40:40.940 --> 02:40:41.940
What's up, guys?

02:40:41.940 --> 02:40:42.940
This is Taijudo.

02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:43.940
Taijudo.

02:40:43.940 --> 02:40:44.940
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:45.940
No, no.

02:40:45.940 --> 02:40:51.660
Just before I go into it, I wanna talk about, I just wanted to recommend a game.

02:40:51.660 --> 02:40:55.260
Well, not actually a game, but what you guys were doing earlier, where you're combining

02:40:55.260 --> 02:40:56.260
toys and games.

02:40:56.260 --> 02:40:57.260
Yeah, yeah.

02:40:57.260 --> 02:40:58.260
What's that?

02:40:58.260 --> 02:41:03.260
How about a chase in the real warriors with the burnout engine?

02:41:03.260 --> 02:41:06.060
Dude, sweet!

02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:07.060
I like that.

02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:12.380
And I'm kinda surprised we didn't get something in that whole racing game theme, because there

02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:14.020
was so much good racing stuff.

02:41:14.020 --> 02:41:18.260
You know, I did consider for a moment a Power Wheels racing game.

02:41:18.260 --> 02:41:19.260
I did.

02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:22.460
That thought did cross my mind, but I like your idea a lot, so.

02:41:22.460 --> 02:41:23.700
Yeah, don't forget about Mask.

02:41:23.700 --> 02:41:24.700
That was also great.

02:41:24.700 --> 02:41:27.980
I don't know about the cartoon, but the toys were great.

02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:32.620
But onto what I was gonna talk about, I don't know if there's still any people out there

02:41:32.620 --> 02:41:37.460
that were interested in the agency MMO that was supposed to come out like eons ago.

02:41:37.460 --> 02:41:38.460
Yeah, whatever happened to that?

02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:39.460
You guys remember this game?

02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:40.460
You've been following this?

02:41:40.460 --> 02:41:43.020
It's supposed to still, supposedly it's still in development.

02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:44.020
I mean, I doubt that.

02:41:44.020 --> 02:41:48.620
I mean, it's been a long time since you've heard anything from it, but according to a

02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:53.260
lot of sources, they're all saying that the game's still coming out on PlayStation 3 and

02:41:53.260 --> 02:41:56.180
the PC, supposedly the PC before the PS3.

02:41:56.180 --> 02:42:01.200
But I don't know, that's kinda shaky, but I do have some good news for people who may

02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:02.780
be still interested in that game.

02:42:02.780 --> 02:42:03.780
What's up?

02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:08.740
There's a Facebook app made by the developers of that game that you can actually play now.

02:42:08.740 --> 02:42:12.860
It's kinda like Mafia Wars, you know, the whole text-based type deal.

02:42:12.860 --> 02:42:13.860
But it's a lot of fun.

02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:17.460
The presentation is really great, and I'm enjoying it.

02:42:17.460 --> 02:42:18.780
Awesome.

02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:24.060
So have they nailed a release window for this yet, or does it need to go through the extensive

02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:26.520
testing first?

02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:27.520
That I don't know.

02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:29.460
I mean, you guys can look that up.

02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:32.700
As far as I know, they're reworking the game.

02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:38.240
They weren't satisfied with what they originally had, the stuff that they were showing at E3,

02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:42.660
and they're supposedly, like, rebuilding a whole other type of game, because for whatever

02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:45.540
their reasons are, they weren't happy with it.

02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:49.460
You know what, that's okay to go back and retool it, because I don't want them to release

02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:50.460
a bunch of crap.

02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:53.100
Because look at what happened with Final Fantasy XIV.

02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:57.740
They didn't really test that thoroughly enough, and when they released it, it ended up being

02:42:57.740 --> 02:43:03.740
kind of hit with a thud, and now they're going to have to rework the game while it's out,

02:43:03.740 --> 02:43:07.460
and now it's kind of done, you know what I mean?

02:43:07.460 --> 02:43:11.500
So I just hope they didn't take out the feature where there was supposed to be some feature

02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:16.580
where you could actually play the game through your cell phone, like you're supposed to take

02:43:16.580 --> 02:43:22.340
on these little, I guess you would call them micro-agents, and they were supposed to build

02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:25.620
cards and gadgets for you, and you were supposed to be able to manage that through your cell

02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:26.620
phone somehow.

02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:27.860
And I thought that was a great idea.

02:43:27.860 --> 02:43:32.020
I like the fact that they were taking MMO in another direction, so hopefully they're

02:43:32.020 --> 02:43:36.540
not coming out with just something like APB where you're just running and gunning, and

02:43:36.540 --> 02:43:38.500
it'll hold a lot of BS.

02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:42.620
I really like that idea of kind of like interacting with the cell phones more and other types

02:43:42.620 --> 02:43:44.140
of things like that.

02:43:44.140 --> 02:43:47.020
I think that's a really kind of good use of...

02:43:47.020 --> 02:43:48.020
Whoa!

02:43:48.020 --> 02:43:49.020
Ah!

02:43:49.020 --> 02:43:50.020
Sorry about that.

02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:51.180
Somebody sent me a YouTube link.

02:43:51.180 --> 02:43:56.740
I brought it up a little soon.

02:43:56.740 --> 02:43:59.620
Sorry.

02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:00.620
That totally threw me.

02:44:00.620 --> 02:44:01.620
Way to go!

02:44:01.620 --> 02:44:02.620
You're dead here.

02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:03.620
I know, gosh.

02:44:03.620 --> 02:44:04.620
All right, sorry about that.

02:44:04.620 --> 02:44:07.020
But that's kind of the way games like Warcraft and so forth are going, where they're fully

02:44:07.020 --> 02:44:11.660
interactive with all these different types of platforms, like the mobile phones and everything.

02:44:11.660 --> 02:44:14.580
Yeah, I think that's the way to go.

02:44:14.580 --> 02:44:17.780
Like I said, I don't know if you remember what I called last week, and I'm all about

02:44:17.780 --> 02:44:23.540
game innovation, and I kind of agree with your previous caller that games need to be

02:44:23.540 --> 02:44:24.540
a little more innovative.

02:44:24.540 --> 02:44:28.420
I mean, I'm not going to quit gaming anytime soon, but they do need to come out with something

02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:32.340
more than just Call of Duty and all the other bullshit that they're coming out with.

02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:33.340
I want something...

02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:36.280
I want them to really take advantage of what we have now.

02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:37.860
We have like motion control crap.

02:44:37.860 --> 02:44:38.860
We have HD crap.

02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:41.500
I mean, there's just so much that they can do with it.

02:44:41.500 --> 02:44:46.620
I mean, I know that it's a whole money management thing, and there's a memory thing, and there's

02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:49.740
a lot of balancing things that you have to do with the games, but I know that they can

02:44:49.740 --> 02:44:52.140
do a lot better than what they're doing now.

02:44:52.140 --> 02:44:53.140
They can at least try.

02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:54.140
It's just BS that's coming up.

02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:55.140
Alright.

02:44:55.140 --> 02:44:58.060
Well, we'll be keeping an eye on this game.

02:44:58.060 --> 02:45:01.780
It does appear that they're still targeting the second half of 2011 for this, but it'll

02:45:01.780 --> 02:45:03.940
be done when it's done, darn it.

02:45:03.940 --> 02:45:10.020
Yeah, and oh, that name of the app is the Agency Covert Ops.

02:45:10.020 --> 02:45:11.020
Look for that on Facebook.

02:45:11.020 --> 02:45:12.020
That's the name of it.

02:45:12.020 --> 02:45:14.620
That is available on Facebook?

02:45:14.620 --> 02:45:18.380
And it looks like it's been up since May of last year, missions, minigames, and sharing

02:45:18.380 --> 02:45:20.980
achievements with Facebook friends.

02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:21.980
Look at that.

02:45:21.980 --> 02:45:22.980
Alright, thanks buddy.

02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:23.980
Thank you so much for the call.

02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:24.980
Alright, goodnight everyone.

02:45:24.980 --> 02:45:25.980
Later.

02:45:25.980 --> 02:45:31.420
Alright, let's go ahead and take one more call here on the Skype line tonight, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:45:31.420 --> 02:45:33.900
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:45:33.900 --> 02:45:37.900
Again, that's 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:45:37.900 --> 02:45:41.860
Loki, do you have any more last minute stories for us while we wait for that call?

02:45:41.860 --> 02:45:42.900
Yeah.

02:45:42.900 --> 02:45:45.220
There's actually some other cool stuff.

02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:47.660
Some stuff coming out of CES.

02:45:47.660 --> 02:45:51.860
They're talking a little bit about Avatar Connect, which is gonna be kind of a new chat

02:45:51.860 --> 02:45:57.420
method that you can use to actually, you know, chat with people, you know, recognize facial

02:45:57.420 --> 02:45:59.300
expressions and stuff like that.

02:45:59.300 --> 02:46:04.000
So kind of mapping your voice to your avatar, which is kind of neat, and that'll be available

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.500
for gold numbers later this spring.

02:46:06.500 --> 02:46:09.780
You'll use it once and then the thrill will be over, but I do like the idea like you can

02:46:09.780 --> 02:46:11.420
like publish it to Facebook and stuff.

02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:14.340
I'll bet you we're gonna start seeing podcasts recorded like this.

02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:17.340
We should do an episode of OLR like this, like a bonus episode of OLR.

02:46:17.340 --> 02:46:18.340
That would be funny.

02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:20.200
That would be kind of funny.

02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:23.580
That's like the one thing we have to do and then that'll be it.

02:46:23.580 --> 02:46:26.580
And the other thing, I don't know if this pissed you off, Rob, they're talking about

02:46:26.580 --> 02:46:32.060
bringing Game Room to the Windows Phone 7.

02:46:32.060 --> 02:46:35.540
That wouldn't piss me off unless they're gonna charge us all over again for everything.

02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:36.540
Probably.

02:46:36.540 --> 02:46:38.240
Now I'm pissed!

02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:44.460
And then also they're gonna be adding on to Windows Phone 7 Fable Queen Golf.

02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:47.540
And I believe they're also bringing in that poker game as well.

02:46:47.540 --> 02:46:48.540
So.

02:46:48.540 --> 02:46:49.540
Alright.

02:46:49.540 --> 02:46:50.540
Interesting.

02:46:50.540 --> 02:46:54.140
Anything else for last minute stories tonight?

02:46:54.140 --> 02:46:58.480
Turbografx Games coming to the PlayStation Network.

02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:02.100
So you can play games that, like Keith Courage, that weren't very good.

02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:04.060
Yeah, these are from Hudson.

02:47:04.060 --> 02:47:05.180
Don't get me started.

02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:08.220
Alien Crush, Bomberman 94, Box Adventure.

02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:09.220
Some of them were good.

02:47:09.220 --> 02:47:10.220
Yeah.

02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:11.220
Some of them were good.

02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:16.580
Dungeon Explorer, New Adventure Islands, Soldier Blades, Super Star Soldier, Victory Run, World

02:47:16.580 --> 02:47:18.820
Sports Competition, and Nootopia.

02:47:18.820 --> 02:47:21.140
Alright, I gotta call waiting, so let's-

02:47:21.140 --> 02:47:23.540
Nootopia is a great game and it's a lot like Zelda.

02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:24.540
Let me go to the phones.

02:47:24.540 --> 02:47:26.060
I think you've done, haven't you done it as a classic game of the week?

02:47:26.060 --> 02:47:27.320
I think I have done Nootopia.

02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:28.860
Let me go to the phones, cause I got somebody waiting.

02:47:28.860 --> 02:47:30.340
Hi, you're on OrangeLawn's Radio, who's this?

02:47:30.340 --> 02:47:31.340
Hey, this is X-Link.

02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:33.340
Hey, X-Link, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:34.340
Hey, nothing much.

02:47:34.340 --> 02:47:39.140
You know, sometimes games and stuff, sometimes, I can understand the other color a while back.

02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:42.700
I mean, there's been times when I step back from playing video games for a while, because

02:47:42.700 --> 02:47:43.700
you know, you get burned out.

02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:47.340
You play stuff, you know, you think a lot of stuff comes out, it's the same thing, it's,

02:47:47.340 --> 02:47:52.940
you know, you know, I take a few days off, maybe read some books, you know, they come

02:47:52.940 --> 02:47:54.300
back and do something else.

02:47:54.300 --> 02:48:00.020
But you know, I'm sure there's something out there for a little bit for everyone, and yeah,

02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:04.220
and as I was telling you earlier, they should make Millie Born into another PC game if they,

02:48:04.220 --> 02:48:08.100
I mean, I know there was one a long time ago, but I think they should make that into another

02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:09.100
one.

02:48:09.100 --> 02:48:10.100
They do need to make another one.

02:48:10.100 --> 02:48:16.740
I have a indie app on my iTouch that I bought from the store that was 99 cents, that was

02:48:16.740 --> 02:48:21.900
kind of the card game, but though it's not the official version, but it plays the same

02:48:21.900 --> 02:48:24.580
way, which is really cool.

02:48:24.580 --> 02:48:30.780
You know, I like playing all kinds of different stuff, role playing, card games, you know,

02:48:30.780 --> 02:48:36.820
games like Super Meat Boy, Nick's Quest was another good one I had played for a bit, you

02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:39.100
know, first-person shooters.

02:48:39.100 --> 02:48:42.900
So when I get bored of one thing, I kind of switch it around to another thing, so that

02:48:42.900 --> 02:48:47.500
way I don't get too burnt out on playing one genre of a certain game.

02:48:47.500 --> 02:48:51.660
That's not bad advice at all, and especially, you know, with thanks to the magic of emulators,

02:48:51.660 --> 02:48:55.860
or I'm sorry, Virtual Console, you know, you can have a variety of different games, you

02:48:55.860 --> 02:48:59.100
know, especially the old school stuff, you know, because that's what our listeners seem

02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:00.880
to enjoy, that you can go back and forth to.

02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:04.580
You know, one odd suggestion maybe I would have for that listener, and maybe this is

02:49:04.580 --> 02:49:08.280
one of those things where I'll get laughed out of the room, but maybe that person should

02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:10.040
try an MMO?

02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:14.180
Maybe if games were a little more social, I don't know, like, for me, like WoW being

02:49:14.180 --> 02:49:19.220
the big social thing it is, kind of keeps me, is what keeps me coming back to that game,

02:49:19.220 --> 02:49:20.220
but at the same time...

02:49:20.220 --> 02:49:26.620
And there's a lot of free ones, too, there's, I mean, I used to play, before I played WoW,

02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:32.140
I played a Persona one that they had that was totally free, so I mean, you know, you

02:49:32.140 --> 02:49:37.340
don't have to really pay to play, so to speak, you know, there's a lot of free stuff out

02:49:37.340 --> 02:49:41.340
there, it's just, you know, it might be another niche, or, you know, something else totally

02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:42.340
different out there.

02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:45.180
You know, I don't think there's anything wrong, though, with the advice of, you know, if you

02:49:45.180 --> 02:49:47.980
think you're bored of video games, take a break, there's nothing wrong with it, you

02:49:47.980 --> 02:49:51.480
don't have to game every single day, I'm not gonna think any less of you, none of us will,

02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:52.480
you know?

02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:53.480
That's not true, but that's alright.

02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:54.480
Stop.

02:49:54.480 --> 02:50:01.180
Go watch some movies, or catch up on TV shows, go read a book, go start another project,

02:50:01.180 --> 02:50:03.900
and then maybe you'll find that game that wants to bring you back.

02:50:03.900 --> 02:50:07.660
And, you know, it's kind of interesting, too, when you're talking about this whole, you

02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:11.580
know, we're, you know, about being lazy and stuff, it's because mostly we get technology,

02:50:11.580 --> 02:50:18.020
our technology has grown so rapidly, so quickly, and it's so easy to access a lot of different

02:50:18.020 --> 02:50:21.660
stuff so quickly, like, why do I need to go to the library to check out a book?

02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:25.220
I can go online and buy the book straight from Amazon and get it right here in my own

02:50:25.220 --> 02:50:31.220
living room, or why do you have to, you know, it's just, unfortunately, with technology

02:50:31.220 --> 02:50:36.540
that, you know, there's always pros and cons to everything, and unfortunately, a pro thing

02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:40.780
is it's quicker and easier, but a con is, too, is that we don't do as much as we used

02:50:40.780 --> 02:50:45.820
to, and it's like, we get to a point in society now, it's like, we want things almost virtually

02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:50.100
handed to us, because we're like, well, we can get this this way, why can't we do this?

02:50:50.100 --> 02:50:54.060
I've got to admit, I've bought a book on my iPhone before, and one of the reasons I kind

02:50:54.060 --> 02:50:59.380
of like that sort of technology is that I have the book with me everywhere I go in case

02:50:59.380 --> 02:51:03.980
I'm ever bored, and that way I'm not carrying around a bulky book, you know?

02:51:03.980 --> 02:51:08.080
That's kind of the one, like, really advantage I like of having it on there.

02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:13.100
But I do also understand, you know, there's really no substitute for an old, dusty book.

02:51:13.100 --> 02:51:14.100
Yeah.

02:51:14.100 --> 02:51:16.300
So, I mean, but, you know, I still read books.

02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:20.180
I have plenty of books on my shelf that I read that's actual, physical books.

02:51:20.180 --> 02:51:23.780
I mean, you know, not everything is an e-book, it's clearly my strategy guides, I mean, I

02:51:23.780 --> 02:51:27.780
have a lot of limited edition strategy guides that I like to have, just for, you know, collector's

02:51:27.780 --> 02:51:31.140
editions, just for, you know, to have on my shelf, because I like looking at them.

02:51:31.140 --> 02:51:36.780
So I mean, you know, so I mean, there's, it's kind of funny when you're saying that, because

02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:41.060
it brought me back to the whole thing back when I was taking technology in class in high

02:51:41.060 --> 02:51:44.140
school, and we're talking about, you know, because of all these pros, there's going to

02:51:44.140 --> 02:51:50.860
be con, you know, like fast food, and movies, and now we got books, and video games, and,

02:51:50.860 --> 02:51:55.340
you know, we don't have to do as much as we used to, to get what we want.

02:51:55.340 --> 02:52:01.540
It's okay, I press a few buttons, or click on a few things, and boom, there it is, so.

02:52:01.540 --> 02:52:02.540
Boom there it is.

02:52:02.540 --> 02:52:04.860
That's, that's definitely the culture we live in now.

02:52:04.860 --> 02:52:09.300
All right, X-Link, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for

02:52:09.300 --> 02:52:10.300
the call, as always.

02:52:10.300 --> 02:52:11.300
As always.

02:52:11.300 --> 02:52:12.300
All right.

02:52:12.300 --> 02:52:14.300
How proud are you of Jamie, and her level 63?

02:52:14.300 --> 02:52:15.300
I'm very proud of her.

02:52:15.300 --> 02:52:20.740
30 levels in one week, Jesus, I can't do anything more, you might get explicit for it.

02:52:20.740 --> 02:52:26.220
Yeah, but, yeah, damn, that's all I'm gonna say, damn, I couldn't believe that, 30 levels

02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:32.020
in almost a week, I, that was just amazing, that, that really, congratulations.

02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:34.620
Thank you, and, and thank you as well for the gift.

02:52:34.620 --> 02:52:36.020
Okay, any time.

02:52:36.020 --> 02:52:38.060
You know, I don't, I don't want to start stuff.

02:52:38.060 --> 02:52:41.140
Please do not read into what I'm about to say the wrong way, because I have nothing

02:52:41.140 --> 02:52:44.680
but respect for other independent podcasters and other indie shows, but there's another

02:52:44.680 --> 02:52:48.020
Warcraft show on this network, and I enjoy the show, it's a great show, I listen to it

02:52:48.020 --> 02:52:52.580
almost every week, but the guy on that show, I think he's been level 51 for, like, four

02:52:52.580 --> 02:52:58.660
years or something like that, and, you know, I, play a game how you want to play a game,

02:52:58.660 --> 02:53:04.600
that's fine, but just, for you to blow through 30 levels in a week just kind of made me laugh

02:53:04.600 --> 02:53:08.900
a little bit, because I'm just kind of like, man, I know other people that are just, like,

02:53:08.900 --> 02:53:12.420
they've been, they, they don't even do a level a month.

02:53:12.420 --> 02:53:16.500
I'm still gonna see if it's possible for me to make 85 before classes start next week.

02:53:16.500 --> 02:53:20.820
Well, what, it took me to get, it almost took me a year to get to 80, but that's only because

02:53:20.820 --> 02:53:25.340
I was only playing a few times a week, and, and I was just doing it a few, few hours a

02:53:25.340 --> 02:53:30.980
day, and, but then again, how was I get to 82, Rob, again, when I got Cata?

02:53:30.980 --> 02:53:31.980
Archaeology whoring.

02:53:31.980 --> 02:53:36.260
That's right, there we go, non-stop, so, yeah, that was a lot of fun.

02:53:36.260 --> 02:53:40.680
You guys are gonna have to show me the ropes, but, the one thing, though, is that, and this

02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:44.980
is, I think, what chased me off before, is the whole feeling like I'm being forced to

02:53:44.980 --> 02:53:46.980
play with people, you know?

02:53:46.980 --> 02:53:50.540
Just do whatever you want to do, like I said before, you had to open the invitation to

02:53:50.540 --> 02:53:54.540
our raids on Wednesday, and if you want to, that's fine, if you don't, you know, there's

02:53:54.540 --> 02:53:55.540
no right or wrong.

02:53:55.540 --> 02:53:59.700
Well, no, I understand that, I've just, I've, I've been getting the, oh, the, the whole

02:53:59.700 --> 02:54:03.980
game experience is when you're playing with, doing, you know, the dungeon thing with a

02:54:03.980 --> 02:54:08.420
lot of people, and I'm like, I've been enjoying playing by myself, I like playing with one

02:54:08.420 --> 02:54:09.420
or two people.

02:54:09.420 --> 02:54:12.180
Really quickly, and I'm not, I'm not gonna say too much on this, because I know people

02:54:12.180 --> 02:54:16.300
are gonna get shut off, but just like, oh, shit, they're talking about WoW, um, Rob invited

02:54:16.300 --> 02:54:20.860
me to WoW a year ago, and when I started playing, I thought for sure that it's gonna be kind

02:54:20.860 --> 02:54:23.860
of like, oh, I'm like, okay, Rob's gonna show me ropes, and I'm gonna do all this stuff,

02:54:23.860 --> 02:54:26.740
and this is gonna be great, and blah, blah, blah, and I know Rob had his own thing, he

02:54:26.740 --> 02:54:31.380
was really busy with work and whatnot, I, I mean, Rob testified, there was times when

02:54:31.380 --> 02:54:35.940
I had to play with him, but for the most part, between me getting to one and 80, was, other

02:54:35.940 --> 02:54:41.100
than the help from another guild leader of ours, um, who will remain nameless, that I

02:54:41.100 --> 02:54:47.660
did 90% of that stuff on my own, I, I, I went through, I, I, I went through all the pug,

02:54:47.660 --> 02:54:53.420
the pugging stuff, through the, the dungeons, and everything else, but for the most part,

02:54:53.420 --> 02:55:01.500
I did non-stop questing from day one, from day one when I started to, when I got to,

02:55:01.500 --> 02:55:07.040
like, 80, um, among a few odds and ends and PVP and whatnot, but, um, but yeah, I had

02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:10.540
a lot of fun playing by myself, and that's one of the few games I can actually say, you

02:55:10.540 --> 02:55:15.940
can play by yourself and have a lot of fun doing it, and you don't really need that,

02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:20.100
that whole, that whole, oh, I need to play with six of my friends in order to get this

02:55:20.100 --> 02:55:21.100
done.

02:55:21.100 --> 02:55:23.580
And you need to play with your friends, too, that's what keeps me in WoW, is raiding.

02:55:23.580 --> 02:55:24.580
Definitely, definitely, by far.

02:55:24.580 --> 02:55:28.580
So, alright, well, anyhow, I gotta let you go before we have Horde House to spin off

02:55:28.580 --> 02:55:31.660
here, but thank you so much for, uh, your call, okay, buddy?

02:55:31.660 --> 02:55:33.460
Any time, any time for me.

02:55:33.460 --> 02:55:34.460
Later.

02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:37.420
I think, uh, pretty soon, I think, especially, like, when you hit, like, about maybe, like,

02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:40.540
level 70 or so, we're gonna have to, well, maybe soon, we'll have to run you into some

02:55:40.540 --> 02:55:43.460
dungeons and, uh, show you the ropes in dungeons.

02:55:43.460 --> 02:55:47.380
I just wanna basically learn how to play with other people so that if I decide that I wanna

02:55:47.380 --> 02:55:49.700
be social, that I'm not gonna kill everybody.

02:55:49.700 --> 02:55:50.700
Yeah.

02:55:50.700 --> 02:55:54.420
I have a problem of accidentally casting my area of effect.

02:55:54.420 --> 02:55:59.860
The dark side of pug groups is that they're not always noob-friendly, and, you know, they

02:55:59.860 --> 02:56:04.460
expect that you know everything, and you may not, and that's very unfortunate, but anyway,

02:56:04.460 --> 02:56:05.460
let's move on.

02:56:05.460 --> 02:56:06.740
I don't wanna get too far into WoW talk.

02:56:06.740 --> 02:56:09.220
Uh, alright, that's gonna do it, though, for the Skypline tonight.

02:56:09.220 --> 02:56:12.100
Thank you guys so much for, uh, your calls, really appreciate it.

02:56:12.100 --> 02:56:16.180
Uh, if you didn't get through, send us an email, mailbag at orangeliontrader.com or

02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:20.300
a tweet at twitter.com slash o-l-r, there's plenty of ways to interact with our program.

02:56:20.300 --> 02:56:22.020
There's also the live chat room every week.

02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:26.140
Alright, uh, that, however, is going to bring us to the end of another episode of Orange

02:56:26.140 --> 02:56:27.140
Lounge Radio.

02:56:27.140 --> 02:56:28.740
We're all done here.

02:56:28.740 --> 02:56:31.420
Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:56:31.420 --> 02:56:34.460
Uh, actually, first I should ask Loki if there's any other last minute stories.

02:56:34.460 --> 02:56:35.460
I don't think-

02:56:35.460 --> 02:56:36.460
I'm done.

02:56:36.460 --> 02:56:37.460
Oh, you're done?

02:56:37.460 --> 02:56:39.020
Alright, well then let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:56:39.020 --> 02:56:41.620
Uh, DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?

02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:44.240
85 by Wednesday.

02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:45.240
Good luck.

02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:46.820
Not 85, I meant 65.

02:56:46.820 --> 02:56:48.820
Oh yeah, you can do it.

02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:49.820
65 by tomorrow?

02:56:49.820 --> 02:56:50.820
Yeah.

02:56:50.820 --> 02:56:51.820
I don't know your schedule.

02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:52.820
Maybe.

02:56:52.820 --> 02:56:53.820
Just made 63.

02:56:53.820 --> 02:56:54.820
Alright.

02:56:54.820 --> 02:56:55.820
Loki, what's your final thought?

02:56:55.820 --> 02:56:59.860
Um, I don't know, Tron.

02:56:59.860 --> 02:57:04.180
My final thought is, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Shermie, Sherie, Sherie, Sherie, Sherie, Sherie,

02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:05.180
Shermie, Sherie, Sherie.

02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:06.180
Yeah, she just came waddling out.

02:57:06.180 --> 02:57:08.500
That's right, now she's just sitting there waiting to poop.

02:57:08.500 --> 02:57:09.500
Hey, babycakes.

02:57:09.500 --> 02:57:10.500
Alright.

02:57:10.500 --> 02:57:12.500
Can I say something to everybody?

02:57:12.500 --> 02:57:13.980
Let's talk about the tester.

02:57:13.980 --> 02:57:19.580
I don't think Shermie is very talkative.

02:57:19.580 --> 02:57:21.900
Shermie's like, what the hell is that?

02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:23.020
Get that out of my face.

02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:24.020
No comment.

02:57:24.020 --> 02:57:25.020
Alright.

02:57:25.020 --> 02:57:27.900
Uh, thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us.

02:57:27.900 --> 02:57:29.260

02:57:32.260 --> 02:57:35.300

02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:41.620
next month.

02:57:41.620 --> 02:57:42.700
I can't believe it.

02:57:42.700 --> 02:57:43.700
Thank you guys again.

02:57:43.700 --> 02:57:44.700
Have a wonderful week.

02:57:44.700 --> 02:57:45.700
We'll see you next week.

02:57:45.700 --> 02:57:50.420
I'm going to be back here to do it all again with a three day weekend, by the way, for

02:57:50.420 --> 02:57:51.420
me next week.

02:57:51.420 --> 02:57:57.020
So, you never know what antics might, if I could get a ride home somehow, uh, we, you

02:57:57.020 --> 02:57:58.020
never know.

02:57:58.020 --> 02:57:59.020
You can sleep on the couch.

02:57:59.020 --> 02:58:00.020
You never know what antics might happen.

02:58:00.020 --> 02:58:01.020
You can sleep in the vault.

02:58:01.020 --> 02:58:02.660
Do you want to do a drunk show next week that bad?

02:58:02.660 --> 02:58:03.660
Will you drink?

02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:04.660
I know he won't.

02:58:04.660 --> 02:58:05.660
He can't.

02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:06.660
He's got to be responsible daddy, but will you?

02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:07.660
Maybe, maybe I will.

02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:08.660
Okay.

02:58:08.660 --> 02:58:13.780
I, because it's been that long, I will get nice and toasty on air for listeners if I

02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:15.740
can figure out a ride home or something.

02:58:15.740 --> 02:58:16.740
Okay.

02:58:16.740 --> 02:58:18.740
So maybe I'll, I'll see if somebody can drive me to the show.

02:58:18.740 --> 02:58:19.740
We'll see.

02:58:19.740 --> 02:58:20.740
Okay.

02:58:20.740 --> 02:58:21.740
All right.

02:58:21.740 --> 02:58:22.740
So lots to look forward to next week.

02:58:22.740 --> 02:58:23.740
We have to warn Dan.

02:58:23.740 --> 02:58:24.740
Yeah.
