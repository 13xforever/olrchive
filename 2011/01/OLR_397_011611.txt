Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends out there on the internet
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
The show where every gamer has a voice
We tape live at All Games Radio
Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you for the next few hours
Along with my co-host, not here tonight sadly
The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
Is absent from the studio tonight
She may be coming about halfway through the show
But she is out at a pinball collecting type of event
It's a private thing so it's not something you would have read about on the internet
But she's having a pretty good time
I know I got a text from her earlier today
That she met some famous pinball maker
So hopefully she makes it back in time during the show
And we can ask her all about her experience there
I know there was beer involved
I don't think there's any beer involved though
With our other co-hosts tonight
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki
How you doing, Loki?
I'm doing fine
Alright, what's new in your world?
How's the baby? How's the wife?
Uh, baby's fine
And wife is doing fine
I don't know if she's over at her mom's house right now
She visits her every day
Or, well, every Sunday
That's awesome that you guys have a Sunday planned
So you can kind of keep doing the show
We'd be screwed without Loki
She doesn't always get over there
I still come here
Let's move on to a special guest joining us tonight
Who's going to be filling in for Dark Sakura
Now, Dark Sakura
Her position could never be filled
But he's going to try
Say hello everybody to Salacious Pop
Hello
How are you Salacious Pop?
I'm great
I'm pinch hitting for Jamie and I get to read stories
It'll be fun
If anyone hears a thud
It's because Rob threw a shoe at me
Because I missed my story cue
And I'm letting there be dead air
So if you hear thud
Stuff happened today
That's what happened there
Just looking forward to it
Again, I don't know how long Dark Sakura's going to be out
She didn't really give a firm time
Because I think she just kind of didn't know
You know, sometimes you get invited to those things
And you're like, I don't know
And I get the sense that it might be a little far away
It might be in the Bay Area
So if they haven't even left the par-tay yet
She might be gone for a while
Yeah, so she might show up and just be like
You get the hell up out my seat
Give me my mic and get out
And that's when I'm going to, you know, bail to the living room
OrangeLoungeRadio.com where we have the live chatters
Every Sunday night while we do tape
I'm noticing
ActDeaf in our chat room says, DarkSakura ain't home
Party!
Actually, it is a little weird
We're in her house right now
And she's very kind
Her and Dan, really, because he lives here too
Letting us kind of come in and do our show anyway
I have the super secret way of getting in the house
When they're not here that I can't say
Because, you know, we don't want the robbers to show up
But yeah, she's very kind
And letting us kind of take over the house
But it's a little weird, I think
To be in someone's house when they're not here
And it's not like a house sitting type of thing
Like, I didn't feed Shermy
Shermy doesn't need to be fed
Shermy's just asleep, Shermy don't give a shit tonight
But anyhow, alright
Enough talk about being in the house when the owners aren't home
And kiddies and so forth
Let's talk about video games
And we'll start off tonight with how is your gaming week
We have to mix it up a little bit tonight because DarkSakura's not here
So we'll start with Loki, how was your gaming week?
It was alright, I didn't play
A ton of things, we have
The new mod games going for Grand Theft Auto
So we've been playing that this week
It's weird though, we've been running into a bunch of
Strange glitches and I'm not really sure
What it's from, I think it might be
Some leftover data that's in the save files
Or something, but
We have it set to all of our
Cop cars are flying around and stuff
But for some reason when we're playing
The single player game, some of the cop cars
Don't fly, so it makes me think
That some of the old data is in there
And then also we've been having issues
With cars disappearing on us
So it'll look like we're flying around
And we're impervious to fire in free mode
For some reason, and it's odd
Because I didn't even touch any of those files
That would affect that, so
It's just a bunch of strange glitches
But I'm working on it
And then other than that
I played a little bit of
What did I play this week actually?
Oh, I tried a bit of
Angry Birds because I've had it
Purchased on my
iPod for the longest time now
And I gotta admit, I don't
I don't understand it, I don't understand what the
Big draw is, it's alright, it's
Kind of fun, but
I got bored of it really quick
So I don't know why everyone's
So gung-ho about it and like
Have this big raging heart on for the game
Because it's not that great
I'm not sure I understand America's
Obsession with Angry Birds either
It's okay, it's
For an iPhone game, it's fine
But it's not something like, oh my god
It's gotta warrant movie rights
And shit like that
And shirts, I went into Hot Topic the other day
There's Angry Birds shirts now
Like really?
I thought Cut the Rope was cuter
Because I like the om nom nom
I just don't get it, I mean
I don't know, like
I've played a lot of addictive games
If anything, I think Plants vs. Zombies
Serves more of
You know, movie rights and that kind of stuff
Versus, you know, stupid
Angry Birds
I'd rather have Angry Birds shirts than
Farmville bottled water
And hot dogs, which is very real
At 7-Eleven, so
Yeah, that's a bit absurd though
For a casual game like that
And then other things I played this week
I just realized it's my move
In Words with Friends
Which is a much more addicting iPhone game
Than Angry Birds
I'll tell you, the only thing that pisses me off
About Words with Friends is people that start random games with me
Because I guess there's no way to like
Take your name out of the random game pool
And I'm like, I don't want to play games with people I don't know
You know?
Especially things like Scrabble
And then there's a chat feature in it
Like, you know, don't talk to me
My friends at work have been consumed by Words with Friends
So I have yet to play that
There was some other stuff that I played that was kind of cool
I've just been downloading a bunch of random things
I actually downloaded today
It was kind of cool
Earth Defense Force
Not the Earth Defense Force that I've
Come to love
But the old Earth Defense Force game
That was on
The Super Nintendo
Which I think came out over here
I want to say UN Squadron
I think was the name of it over here
Oh god, I loved UN Squadron
The old it?
That was a Capcom game years ago
I think that's the one
It looks similar, I could be wrong
I think it's that game
But then there was another one I downloaded
Raptor Call of Shadows
Which is an old shareware game
From way back in the day
From Apogee
So that was pretty sweet
So I downloaded that
What else did I play?
Funny enough I was actually playing some
Technically I guess it's a game
Because it's an app and it's
Questions
But I've been playing the
And I don't know why I'm obsessed with this now
The Mensa
Test quiz
Type stuff on there
Because I guess I scored pretty high on the website thing
So now I'm actually going to try
I'm a Mensa member
I'm really smart you guys
I'm not a member
I have to take the test
I can be a certified
Genius that way, no?
Ray Ayanami in our chat room says
Area 88 slash UN Squadron
NACDEF says UN Squadron does not equal
Earth Defense Force
It just looks similar
I know there's something else I played
I think I may have played a little bit of Swords and Poker
That's pretty fun
I haven't really been doing a whole ton of gaming
Mainly Grand Theft Auto
Mainly Grand Theft Auto
Oh, and actually I did try
There was a video that was out earlier this week
Of people playing Grand Theft Auto
Where they had the cars
Didn't really have any
Friction on them
So they just kind of went wacky
And started flying around
Everywhere and it's very chaotic
So I actually have my PC game set up like that
Right now
It was something I was going to be trying out
Even before I saw that video
There was this guy
Who goes by the name Shadow on the boards
That I'm on that he did that
And there was another mod that he did that was kind of funky
Like that
I'm actually probably going to apply those to the
Ballet of the Gay Tony stuff
We've only been playing Lost in Damned
So it'd be fun to
Add that to it
And then also apparently they're going to be releasing
Script editing tools soon
Which just opens up the realm of possibilities
For Grand Theft Auto modding to
All sorts of crazy lengths
I mean because if we have access to
Edit the scripts we can pretty much
Do whatever we want in the game
Which is pretty awesome so
I'm very excited to see what comes of that
That's about it
Alright
SalaciousPop how was your gaming week?
What kind of games did you play this week?
My gaming week is pretty embarrassing
Not much to talk about
Lots of wow
You want me to talk about that at length
I'll go on your other podcast
So just leveling up my main
And doing Cataclysm stuff
I got a 1600 point
Gift card for XBLA
And I finally used it for Christmas
So I finally used it and I picked up the
Scott Pilgrim game
The River City Ransom clone
So I tinkered with that a bit
And then I also used it to get
The Pac-Man Championship Edition DX
And I also
Have played some
Plants vs. Zombies
Game of the Year edition
Which was left over from the Steam sale
When I picked it up for like 4 bucks
Over Christmas and then
Poker Night at the inventory
And I'm now 60 grand in the hole
Again in my global stat
So I need to win 2 rounds
So that's frustrating
Have you unlocked everything in your Poker Night game yet?
I still have lots of table tops and card decks
To unlock, about 4 left of each
I know Bobby
The man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio
He talked at length tonight about
Back to the Future, the new Telltale
Game that came out. Do you have any interest in
Back to the Future games?
I haven't played any of the Sam & Max
And I loved the original one when it was on the
SCUMM engine, so all of the Telltale
Episodic ones, I haven't
Really messed with those at all
And there's also
The
The episodic game that I'm really looking forward to
Isn't Telltale, sadly, but it's the Penny Arcade one
Precipice of Darkness
On their website
They wrote the third volume
As an actual
Like they wrote it out like a fanfiction
So I guess the third one was just
Scrapped because they wrote it out instead
Like a book
They had the first game and the second game
It was kind of a back and forth thing
Because I remember reading some things about it
Where there was a joke on Twitter
About, you know, if so many people
Will buy this game when it's discounted, then we'll make the third game
And the Penny Arcade guys basically came out and said
Actually, that's not true. There's not going to be a third game
Basically. I don't know if it's a sales thing
I completely missed when that was made official
All this time for the last three years, I was like
When are we getting volume three?
But they just wrote it. Sorry. Oh, alright.
Alright, so that's all
Fans vs. Zombies and
Poker Night. It's kind of like when a show on TV
Gets cancelled and you can like
Maybe the producer will write something on the internet
Or you can watch the rest of the episodes
On CBS.com or whatever
When you desperately hope that they
Were able to squeeze out two or three
Episodes to wrap it up
After they get cancelled, it's like, no
The seventh episode is it. There's no closure at all
What was that freaking show I actually
Watched? I think it was
Harper's Island or something. It was on TV
It was like a murder mystery
Somebody dies every week and I think it got cancelled
By CBS like halfway through and he had to finish
Watching it on CBS.com
And it was actually
Not that good of a show. I don't know why I
Watched it every week and it had
Kind of a crappy, guessable ending but whatever
Probably the same reason we watched the Tester
Probably, probably. Hey
You know what, actually the Tester, the second
Season of the Tester was probably a little better
Than Harper's Island and less predictable
Sadly
There you go
All sorts of embarrassing TV shows
Speaking of embarrassing fandom, I will say the Telltale
Game I'm actually looking forward to is Jurassic Park
Like I'm really curious to see what they
Do with it. It's such a weird license
In some ways for them to have
But I'm kind of excited to see kind of what they do with it
Do you guys remember like the Jurassic Park games
From what they had on Super Nintendo
Remember the Super Nintendo Jurassic Park game?
It was all, yeah it was kind of cool
But at the same time it was a little
Bit junky, I mean
I remember two games that came out
Both platformers that were night
And day between the Super Nintendo
And Genesis versions
And it was completely different
And Aladdin, when people put on Aladdin
For the Genesis it's like, this is amazing
And Jurassic Park was the same way
Way better on the Genesis
Yeah, Jurassic Park, well I believe Jurassic Park you had to play
The dinosaur, it was like, wasn't that kind of
The trick to it? You could play the dinosaur
Or you could play the doctor
And it was kind of a cool thing
Super Nintendo 1 had more of like
A Zelda-esque overworld
And I use that term very loosely
But then when you would go into the caves
The dungeons were DOOM basically
But it was kind of like
You know, at that time we didn't have a lot of
First person shooter type games
And I believe it was one of the earliest games to use surround sound
So you know, if you had a pretty good surround system
That game was really kind of scary
You know, at least for a kid
Who was playing on the Super Nintendo
So, anyhow, we'll stop talking about
Games from 15 years ago
And talk about something a little more current
My Gaming Week, sadly not a lot of
New stuff, you know again mostly
Wow and My World as well
Still playing a little bit of Fallout 3
As well as some other miscellaneous things here and there
Not a lot of new stuff I tried out
I did kind of go to the Indie Store
And I tried a few games on the Xbox Live Indie Game Store
Because you know, there's some gems out there once in a while
You'll find some
And I always feel bad giving games on the Indie Store
Negative reviews because
You know, we do an independent thing here
And I feel like we should support other independent games
But sometimes there's just games
I really have a hard time justifying
And one of them is this game called
Maids with Balloons, have you seen this game?
On the Xbox Live Indie
Marketplace
I don't know how to explain it
It looks like a bad CD-ROM
Game from like when CD-ROM
Would first came out where they
Did these full motion movies
Or whatever and it looks like these
Guys who made the game rented a room
At Motel 6 and got their friends
To dress up in maid outfits
And just act out these scenes
Pay them in drinks
Didn't even pay them in cash
They got their three cute girlfriends to dress in maid outfits
And pay them in drinks
And it was like, Skidamax movies
Have more plot than this thing did
And then you go into the game itself
And it's like you're trying to launch balloons
Up at seagulls
So they don't poop on you
It's a really terrible shooter from
The 80s, Atari 2600 caliber
If someone submitted this game
To Newgrounds it would get blammed
And make it to the Flash Portal
It belongs on Newgrounds
It was funny, just how bad it was
And then they had the whole like pouting thing
At the end, oh they didn't buy the game
Because they don't like us or whatever
And I'm just thinking, wow
This was somebody's fantasy project
I can't even
But there's guys with maid fetishes
That'll have a field day with this
Have fun
I guess this is kind of a
Lights off, pants down kind of game for you guys
Anyhow, other indie games
That are worth much more of your time
For checking out was the
You have to help me remember the name of this game
It was Cthulhu Saves the World
Which is by the same guys that did Breath of Death
7
Which I have yet to play
Obviously they love their old school
RPGs and I mean like Dragon Warrior
On the NES
Style games or you know like
Original Fantasy Star
So it's kind of like throwing back to the 8-bit days
Cthulhu Saves the World is cute because it definitely
Uses some of that tongue in cheek humor
Where as the
Narrator is talking, Cthulhu's like
I can hear you
It's kind of a cute little premise
The game itself
I don't know, like going back to
Really old games like Dragon Quest and
Fantasy Star, they feel a little more
Grind fest to me now
Than they used to
So I don't know, the game itself, they tried to do some
Neat new things with the battle system for like combo
Encounters and things like that but
Oh and the other thing I got to say I like
They had this whole system where the
Most number of random battles
You'll ever get into in a dungeon is 25
But if you want to fight
More random encounters, you can go to the main
Menu and select fight
And it's kind of like you will purposefully go into another
Random encounter fight, that's a really
Neat kind of system, like somebody really kind of thought
That one out, like how to
Make it, you remember like there'd be certain
Dungeons in Final Fantasy games
That every two steps was like walk walk
Like random battle comes in
Right and it would get really annoying
I thought that was kind of a neat way to
Make sure that it's always going to be a little bit
Consistent and not become too cumbersome
And once you hit your cap, you're done
You can just explore the cave all you want and not worry
About any more surprises
So yeah, I thought that was
It has some neat ideas, so I like
That it's trying to take that really old 8-bit
Idea and make it better
It still felt a little bit like a Grind fest
To me, but the humor in the game
Makes it, I think, a little more
Bearable and makes you kind of
Curious what joke they're going to tell next
So, and especially for the price
Because you know, indie games are very reasonably priced
240 Microsoft points, that's what, 3 bucks?
As much as you pay for something in the game room
I'd say, heck yeah, why not?
Go do it. I was really impressed by
The soundtrack in Cthulhu
Saves the World. It did have a good soundtrack. Amazing soundtrack
And yeah, it was pretty funny when he
One of the first things you do is you
Rescue sort of a damsel in distress
On the beach
And you save her and Cthulhu is like
So am I a hero now?
And the narrator's like, you're the Dark Lord of
The Eldritch, like hell no
Saving a girl isn't going to cut it
We need a little bit more from you
And that was kind of funny how it's very sarcastic
And she has a big crush on him
Yeah, she falls in love with him with his big tentacle mouth
She's like, oh you are so fine
Aren't you just waiting for the Uosugdoji scene
To come happen?
That's unpleasant
But I do want to keep playing just to see
If that happens
Although I think games on the marketplace
Can't be too adult
Although somehow this
Borderline innuendo made game
Gets on the marketplace
I mean granted, there's no titty
The game would have been ten times better
If there were boobs
There was one with titty in it
Was that the guy game?
Was that for the PS2?
On the indie games or whatever
And it was some chick or whatever
Like this guy's girlfriend
She wasn't like supermodel
It was just
Some normal chick
That they had her in lingerie
And that game got yanked
Really quick though
Unfortunately
Now that we've had maids with balloons
I'm just waiting for furries
With guns
I can't wait for there to be the furry porn game
On Xbox Live
I'm kind of surprised it hasn't hit yet
And then there could be furries with guns
Versus maids with balloons
Crazy, so there you go
By the way, I just got a text message
From Miss Dark Sakura
She's gonna be here in two hours
I don't know if she's gonna make it
She's just barely gonna hit the end of the show
If she gets here
She can do her cage match
That's not even the podcast part
Trying to think of anything else
I want to say there was one other game I had tried
Oh, the cute little arcade game
The Rascals, was that what it was called?
The skulls?
Yeah, with the skulls that was kind of like Mr. Driller
It was Mr. Driller meets
You know what it was? The Mario Brothers
Game on Game Boy Color
Did you ever play that?
Where you could link the systems
And race Mario and Luigi to beat the level
As fast as possible
Did you ever play that?
Okay, well somebody took that idea
And made like a game out of it
Where basically you race
It's a little platformer where you're trying to get
From start to finish as fast as possible
And then there's this whole Mr. Driller element
With the colored blocks that you dig through
Kind of thrown in as well
So yeah, if you're like a fan of the old school
8-bit platformer games
Especially Mario Brothers type
It's cute
Some weird
Plot devices they use
I didn't get the whole opening
With the ship and the rats
I get that they're supposed to be the antagonists
But I don't know
I think this game just needed to kind of throw me in
And start playing
I didn't need all the exposition in the beginning
It was a little weird
But the game's cute
It's definitely worth checking out the demo if you like
Either old school games or you like platformer games
You can kind of make your decision from there
Because the demo's pretty robust
So you can check that out
That's pretty much it though
For my gaming week otherwise
Not a whole lot else to report on
So I'll just talk housekeeping real quick
We are still here
Moving towards our 400th show
Set for the first week of February
We're tossing around some ideas internally
Nothing yet
I don't think it's going to be too big of a deal
We've had enough self-serving anniversary episodes
Amongst our 9 year run
We plan to do something a little bit special
Actually right now we're talking
Trying to bring back something the listeners
Have been asking for for a very long time
And I'll leave it at that
We're going to hopefully debut that back on episode 400
And I'll let you all speculate what that is
Otherwise other housekeeping things

How about some news
We've got a lot of it tonight
It was surprisingly a busy week
I guess now the holidays have officially
Been out and people are back at work
We're getting back into some gaming news
For what's going to happen through the summer of this year
And we start tonight with Loki
Ah yes
And speaking of people being busy
No one's been busier than Sony
And their legal team
They've been spending the week
Suing hackers
For hacking the Playstation 3
Two groups of course
That they were going after
Fail Overflow
The hacking group that
During a recent conference was talking about
How they've basically
Found all the
Public keys and were able
To fully open up
The system for
Homebrew and whatnot
And then of course
The famous in the iPhone scene
GeoHot
Or George Hot
He was the one that actually pioneered
The jailbreak for the iPhones
And um
You know later on
Went to release the keys
For the Playstation 3 hacking
Um
And yeah they're not too pleased by it
Of course
They're saying
According to the court documents
The hack violates the DMCA
And the already pirated games are being
Packaged and distributed with these
Circumvention devices
Which by the way is not true
And then
Um
Of course George Hot
Made a comment about that
I would expect the company that prides itself on intellectual property
To be well versed in the provisions
Of the law so I'm disappointed
In Sony's current action
I have spoken with legal counsel
And I'm comfortable that Sony's action against me
Doesn't have any basis
Well of course it's going to continue on from there
Um
So here's how it kind of played out this week
GeoHot on his website
Actually put the keys
Out there so people had access
To them as well as
Various signing tools
And samples of possible ways to
Install and run homebrew
Of course you know
None of this actually has anything to do with
Pirating games it's just
Installing homebrew and in fact
There are some limitations to what he's already
Released
To not allow
Pirating games
At least yet
Um
Then it's kind of funny
There's just all sorts of stuff going on
Um
Try to go a little bit more in detail here
So
There's a few funny things that are kind of going on
About this whole court case to begin with
One
Sony decided you know
To I guess
Get evidence that
Hotz was accepting money
Donations
Basically saying that oh he was charging
People for these exploits
They actually sent him a dollar to his
Paypal account Sony did
Which is kind of weird
And of course you know
Hotz's attorney they're saying
Hotz has not produced a manufacturer sold
Nor does he have
Any intent whatsoever to produce manufacturers
Sell any devices that facilitate piracy
And
They're saying that
Basically it
Dismisses Sony's
Use of piracy case
For precedent because the case
Involves hardware use to circumvent
PSC's protection not
Software
That is weird that Sony sent him a dollar
I mean I understand it was probably for the purposes of
Putting together their argument or whatever
Like they had to do it to kind of like
You know
There's a lot of weird stuff going on
In more detail where it doesn't even make any sense
Sure okay
Because the whole court case is going down in San Francisco
And you might think
Well that's you know doesn't sound
Too strange but this guy
Actually resides in New Jersey
Totally out of his jurisdiction
Yeah but Sony's in San Francisco
Aren't they?
I understand that but they're taking the case up against him
They have to do it in his jurisdiction
But their thing is basically
That he communicated on Twitter
He communicated over
You know
Using PayPal or something like that
And those two companies reside in Northern California
So therefore
Is this a copyright or trademark
Issue that they're going for?
No they're going for the fact that he released their public keys
Okay
Because I know anything to do with
With copyright or trademark
Or whatever is federal
So then you can intentionally file the
Claim out of state to make the person
Drag their ass to the court where you filed it to
Well they basically did that
Kind of
One of the comments they're saying is
I think it's quite telling that Sony
Who legally is required to provide
Notice to Mr. Hotz before seeking any special
Relief with the court decided to
Email Mr. Hotz a copy of their motion
At 7pm when a
Hearing was scheduled for the next morning at 9am
In California while Mr. Hotz doesn't
Even live in California
Sony's seeking various unreasonable reliefs
Seizing Mr. Hotz personal property
And computers
Luckily the courts postpone the hearing
And this is just
They have a bunch of comments from different law firms
Well I'm pretty sure it's just you know the big company
Exercising their big company muscle
To try and squelch out this guy
Who has very limited resources I'm sure
Even if they don't have a case they're basically saying
Hey buddy you're gonna spend money on a
Plane ticket to drag your ass out here to defend yourself
Well here's what it is
And you have to understand there's more
This is bigger than just
This a hacker
You know hacking Sony stuff
What this does is sets precedent for
A few things
There is similar cases that went on
When the whole jail breaking
Of the iPhone thing happened
And that actually
Was overturned in courts and now it is
Legal to jail break
Your phone because of that
Court case well this
Interesting comparison I never thought
Of that sorry I just had to get that out there but I didn't
Realize you're right
What this story is is very similar
To the whole jail breaking your iPhone
It's using your device not the way
The company intended but not necessarily
It's even going beyond that
The whole thing is
Remember when you buy these consoles
In their end user license agreement
It's basically making it seem like
You're leasing this property
That is Sony's and they're
Paying a fee to basically lease it
So literally it's their property but it's in your home
This would actually set precedent
That this is your console
You can do whatever the fuck you want with it
If he ends up winning this case
Is what it's going to come down to
I wonder how that would impact the next generation
Of games and the reason why I say that
Is that you know why that's in there is because
Companies take a big loss
On their consoles
Even when the Playstation 3 came out for
What was it $700 when it first came out
Sony was still taking a loss on those consoles
Usually the manufacturers put out
The consoles at a loss
Unless you're the Wii
Was the one console that they weren't taking a loss on
But all these other consoles they take a loss
Because they make the money back from the games
That are sold and all the licensing that comes from that
So if somehow
If suddenly this thing is unlocked
That you don't have to pay for games anymore
Then this company is consistently
Losing money every time a console is sold
So it's going to be interesting that the courts
Come in and say well
Obviously it is just like the jailbroken iPhones
You can use these consoles for whatever you want
Is that going to drive the price
Way up of the next series of consoles
I don't think they can do that
Well I mean they can do that obviously
But I don't think it would be smart for them to do that regardless
Because a lot of people don't have the know-how
To do this
Although
He went on G4
And made a comment about what the whole case was going on
He doesn't feel that he's
In the wrong
Obviously and
It's basically as simple as right now
If your console is not to the latest
Firmware all you have to do is
Download a firmware update that's on his website
And you can immediately download
That firmware, update your console
And boom there it is right there
The ability to install Homebrew
And that's on any console that's out there right now
And it's just, it's ridiculous
A few other things
Real quick
Can I read some comments from chat because obviously
This is a very un-passionate issue
And some folks in the chat room are kind of lighting up about this
Nick Gertz in our chat room
I don't recognize that name so welcome if it's your first time
And our chat room says BS once you buy something it's yours
You should be able to do whatever the fuck you want
With what you own
Read the end user license agreement
You may think that and you may feel that
And I agree it should be the case
But that's not what they're saying
That's why they're able to patch your
PlayStation 3 to remove the other operating system
And all that stuff
I definitely agree with Nick
That's going to be very interesting
And then SSJ100Matt in our chat room says
Can't blame Sony for protecting its properties
I think they sort of have an obligation to
Because of
That agreement that they have with developers
That there's all these other companies
That if this whole thing ends up going
Against Sony
They have an interest in that too
Here's the problem though
This may be Sony's
Big
Weakness in this case
Is that they're saying that this
Enables piracy
It hasn't enabled piracy yet
This is not something that's
Well that's true but we're talking now
We're not talking about in the future
That's stupid
Should Sony have waited and
Tell piracy was a factor?
Here's the other thing too
Geohot has only released
And this is all speculation
He's only released a portion
Of the key
Basically he has a
A key for signing these applications
That you create in homebrew
It's one key though
There's a key generator though
That they have to generate these keys
That can be used to sign these different applications
But he hasn't released a generator
He's only released a single key
So in theory Sony could just ban that key
And all the homebrew stuff wouldn't work anymore
But he's smart you see
Because he's hoping this court case
In favor, if that's the case
Then it'll be legal for him to release that key
And it's over, it's done
There's nothing they can do
Once that's out there, there is no way to block that
Anymore, they're done
It's over
SalaciousPop you want to say something and then I'll go to more chat comments
Yeah this is really just about
Opening up additional functionality
On a console that you own
If it was some type of hack
Where I don't know you could pull games
Down from the Playstation network
Or that was a demo
And unlock it
Completely different thing I'm talking about here
Where you could then play the full version of the game without paying for it
Then yes, that's something that would hurt the developer
But that's completely different
That's not what we're dealing with here
It's just opening up the console for
Homebrew and whatever else
Now granted everyone doesn't necessarily share
That same ideal
There's people out there that's like
Okay how can I use this, the pirate stuff
Oh yeah
This is one hacker they're going after
This is not the whole hacking community
It's one guy
He's not going for piracy
So the fact that they're saying
He's releasing tools to
Enable piracy
Yeah in the long run maybe
But you could say
Well you release the console that enables piracy
Because eventually
There will be piracy on it
And just think if they would have just kept Linux on the damn system
Maybe people wouldn't have gone here
I'm convinced that most of the hardcore people
In the crypto and DRM
Communities that love breaking that stuff
Don't even play games
They're like this is an awesome thing
It's got awesome DRM on it, I want to break it
Because that's fun as hell
It's funny they're asking him
So what's something
Once this whole PS3 thing is done
What's your next thing, what are you going to move on to next
What's your next
Because he stopped doing the iPhone stuff
Because he got bored with it
That's all it was
And this guy he's like 21 years old
21 year old
And so he got bored with
Whatever it was and he's like
Well I hear the PSP2 is coming out
Let me go to the other comments from chatroom
Chat.orangelandrater.com
DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says
Can I put end user license agreements on other things in life
Like the door to my house
Maybe
SpazinatorPC says
If I ever mess with my system
I'd be too afraid of bricking it
Thus losing my video content that I bought
That's kind of where I'm at
A little bit
I really don't have a good reason
To hack my system
Me personally
Because I don't really want to
Pirate everything
I don't know
There's limits and I think that's a bit much
Then we won't have games anymore
If everybody goes batshit crazy about pirating
But you know
I don't know I'd be afraid
Of some of this other stuff
Of just screwing my console
Especially 360
I have lots of XPLA games I've bought
Like over 100
It's pretty disgusting
Of course I've had my console for 4 or 5 years now
Yeah I don't want to lose that
So I'm afraid to do anything that might even
Get my console banned or lose me access
To all that crap you know what I mean
I haven't been into
Chipping or modding systems since the PS1
And the Dreamcast
After that era I stopped
Doesn't mean I'm not still interested in that community
But just as far as
The consoles have just gotten too expensive
For me to open it up
I'm not a whiz with a soldering iron
As I once was so I'd probably brick the hell out of it
But yeah
I find these stories really interesting
But I haven't been into modding or any of that stuff in a while
I would say I would support
Trying to get around region locking
And that kind of made me think about that
Ray Iannami says I could have hacked my US 360
Then I would have had to get a Japanese one
Or then I wouldn't have had to get a Japanese one
And that kind of made me think you know yeah
Getting around region locking I think
I don't understand region locking
I do
I understand why they do it
That doesn't mean I support it
I know it's coming up later in the show
Let's not forget
And I know somebody is going to say it if I don't
PS3 of course is not region locked
That's good though
Here's what comes down to it
I think that when you
Remove functionality like that
It's not even necessarily removing it because a lot of the consoles in the past
Did not have, they weren't region free
But nonetheless
If you remove
Or do not have features like it being
Region free
I think if it wasn't region free
That'd give more people motivation to try to hack it
To make it region free
Just like we're going to get into another system
That's region free
I really
You don't want to give them more
Excuses to try to hack your system
And in the PS3 actually
I think that's why it's taken so long
It's because it had Linux enabled on it
From the beginning
And it was region free
Why do you need to hack the system?
Because most people are trying to install homebrew
Or play stuff from other regions
So it's all there
Well they didn't remove the region locking
They removed Linux
And once they removed Linux
People took interest in trying to get that back
Because people don't like things
That are taken away from them
I just want to throw it out there
If the Wii wasn't region locked
We could have totally made President and Cat sell more than 100 copies
Just saying
If you remember that whole debacle from like 2 years ago
2 years ago?
It's about at least a year and a half
Not 2 years ago
It was a while
I found it interesting that dude was on
Attack of the show and all this stuff
He's become this e-list celebrity now
He's big in the
Iphone community
He came up with the jailbreak stuff
That's pretty big
Alright
Let me go to some other stories here
Kind of getting into other
Legal-ish type of things
Although I don't think this is going to end up being a lawsuit
There was this whole back and forth
Between Capcom Mobile
This week and the folks that made
Explosion Man
Twisted Pixel
And it has to do with the game Maxplosion
Which came out for the Iphone
Which of course was released to iTunes
Very similar to Explosion Man
Both feature Little Red Demons
Kind of running around
They're even similar names
Doing similar things
Yeah
Capcom Mobile took a little bit of heat this week
For doing that
So much that the Twisted Pixel programmer
Mike Henry on his Twitter account said
Quote, Maxplosion gameplay
Video makes me sad
If you're going to outright steal a game
You should at least understand what makes it fun
Another note to this is that Twisted Pixel
Had actually once met with Capcom
About getting them to distribute
Explosion Man
Capcom passed
So for them to do something like this was especially insulting
Well Capcom had to put out some fires of their own
They of course were
Sadened by the whole situation
Let me tell you how sad in this little statement
Quote, while Twisted Pixel did have
Discussions with our console game team
About publishing Explosion Man on game consoles
Capcom Mobile is a different division
Of Capcom with separate offices
And as such had no prior knowledge
Of any meetings between the console game team
And Twisted Pixel
Maxplosion was developed independently by Capcom Mobile
Nonetheless we are saddened by this
Situation and hope to rebuild the trust
Of our fans and friends
In the gaming community
We're sorry
We're sorry
I like how it completely dodges the fact
That the game is a total
You know, I don't want to say rip off
But heavily influenced
By Explosion Man
You know what I mean?
That press release totally dodges
That part of it
Well Capcom Mobile, they have different employees
And they're in a different building
Than Capcom
They wouldn't work with Capcom console people
At all, I mean god
They wouldn't be working with those teams
When they port over their crappy ports of games
Onto the iPhone or whatever
Thank you for Dead Rising with four zombies in it
So you're telling me
That these people have no communication
That's like the whole Coke Zero
Coke thing
I think people are reading
A little too much into what Twisted Pixel said
Believe it or not
I believe Capcom
I think a lot of times these big companies
Especially international companies
Tend to work in little silos
And I don't think
That the Capcom division said one to another
Hey, we got presented this little game
You guys should try it
I don't think that ever happened
Here's what I think did happen
Explosion Man's been out for a good six months now
I think some people in the mobile division played it
And said we want to do a game like this on the iPhone
I honestly don't think
It was ever one of those
Don't make it shadier than it already is shady
You know what I mean?
But let's face it folks
I look at this and I go
This is news, really
Games ripping each other off
That's been happening forever
And especially on the iPhone
Hello Gameloft
I mean, ironically enough
Street Fighter 2
How many times was that game ripped off?
It got a lot of shoddy ports done to it
This show started
Then a game came out called In the Groove
And there was much heated debate
About what a ripoff In the Groove was
Games biting from one another
Happen all the time
It happens in movies too, you guys
A lot of movies are ripoffs of one another
It's not that surprising
It's up to the gamers
To reject the crap
And if you think that this is
A crappy derivative of Explosion Man
Don't buy it
Don't support the ripoff
Don't buy it
It's cute, I guess, in some ways
That Capcom's being called out on this
But I really don't think Capcom's alone
In what they're doing
I think every game company out there is guilty of doing it at some point
Name me a company
I'm sure there's a ripoff game they've done at some point
I can't think of any
Anyway
I'm not taking that literally
I'm not trying to profess to be this encyclopedia
But I'm sure most big companies
At one point or another
Have ripped off another game
Or allowed a game to heavily influence
What they're doing
And yeah, some comments from our chatroom here
Darktitsia says Great Gianna Sisters
Well, you know
That ended up getting pulled from shelves
So I was a little too close
And it's coming out in DS in February
Yeah, but it's all different now
One of the great things about Great Gianna Sisters
Actually, if you want to go way back
Great Gianna Sisters was a game
That came out for
The Commodore 64
And it really looked and felt like Mario
Especially like the first level
Blue sky
Bricks on the ground
Goomba looking monsters
Bricks that turned into coins
I mean, damn
It was really, really just like Mario
Little power-ups that make you get bigger
It really was pretty much a Mario Brothers ripoff
Ironically enough, when you get into later levels
There are some kind of different mechanics
That do set the game apart a little bit
But here's the thing
The reason why people remember that game so fondly
It wasn't necessarily the game itself
But it had a kick-ass soundtrack
If you've ever heard the soundtrack to Great Gianna Sisters
And a lot of the Commodore 64 music
You still hear that influence today
I mean, Chiptune, bit music
All of it is influenced by Commodore 64 stuff
All of it
And so there was such great music
That came out of that Commodore 64 era
Great Gianna Sisters I think is fondly remembered
Because, yeah, it was a ripoff of a game
It had an awesome soundtrack
Dark Tetsuya also brings up Casey Munchkin
Which was an Odyssey game
That was a total ripoff of Pac-Man
Game Guru says
Capcom even sued for Fighter's History
But that time they lost
It's kind of interesting what games are considered too close
And what games aren't
ActDeft, by the way, in our chatroom
Says, Loki, I know a guy that works at Gameloft
He pretty much has told some friends
And me that they pretty much ripoff games
And just make some cosmetic changes
Gameloft had a Castlevania Symphony of the Night ripoff
They were going to release a few years ago
But they cancelled it
But here's the thing, though
But, you know
To Gameloft's credit
Some of their games are actually pretty good
I mean, granted, they're not the most original thing
But damn, you know
For what it's running on
It's pretty good
Problem is, when they go to
Develop on consoles
They don't really learn that, okay
I can't put out a
Well, you can put out a Modern Warfare 2
Clone, but
No one's going to give a shit
Because it's on consoles now
It's not as impressive as making it run on the
You know, iPhone or whatever
But yeah, their boards, I mean, or whatever
Aren't, they aren't terrible
I mean, I haven't played all of them
But
They look, compared to like
Hungry bird clones and stuff like that
It could be a lot worse
Funny enough, if Gameloft had put out
A version of Splosion Man, do you think it would've
Necessitated all these stories on Gamelogs
This week? Nope
It was funny, though, because they did have
A story, they didn't make our show roll
But Gameloft was saying
We don't rip games off
There's just a limited amount of genres
That we can use, so a lot of games
Look similar
No
I'm sorry, that is a bunch of shit
Do you know why this, I think, got
Traction and is all over the news?
Because it's Capcom, and they expect better from Capcom
Exactly, because Capcom, I think
Has always been seen as, they're one of us
They're friends with the community
They're letting the people
Design Mega Man Legends 3, they're the
Good guys. I'd expect better from Capcom
The console
Game manufacturer
Capcom Mobile, their stuff
Is shit. That's true, the Mega Man game
On iPhone, shit. Absolute shit
Dead Rising, terrible
Devil May Cry
I haven't actually played it yet
But I'm sorry, it probably won't be good
So
No, I don't expect much better from
Capcom Mobile
Now Capcom, though, if they actually put out an
Xbox Live Arcade game of Maxplosion
Then I'd be a little sad
Now you're acknowledging that they're separate divisions
This is what I'm saying
Well, it's their words
I don't think they're talking
To each other, to this extent
I don't think it's some mass conspiracy
The steel explosion, man
It's not anything like that
It's just
It's supposed to make crappy
Games in their mobile department
What can I say?
Alright, let's move on
Who's accusing who of ripping
Someone off next? And we'll go to another news
Story from Salacious Pop
Champions Online
Which came out in September
Of 09, some
Brief 15-16 months ago
Is going free to play
I think Lord of the Rings Online
Was the most recent major MMO to do this
Champions Online
Will be going free to play starting
January 25th
You can download the client and
Create your superhero or your villain
And go along your crime fighting way
When it gets relaunched
On the 25th
Getting a new title
Champions Online Free-for-All
Which sounds like it might be an expansion
But that's just what they're rebranding it
For the free-to-play model
This story is kind of
Important to me simply because I
Was a huge
I was hugely cuckoo bananas over City of Heroes
Played that for three years
And the team within Cryptic
Studios that was working on City of Heroes
Was spun off to
Paragon Studios which is now its own thing
Just for City of Heroes
Because Cryptic got the Champions Online license
And it was going to be the first
MMO that had
PC and Xbox
360 support
Where you could have an account
That worked on both
Platforms
And a month or two before release
Microsoft pulled the plug
On the Xbox Live component
Of the MMO
When they launched they already had
Potentially 50% of
Their game base taken away from them
It became PC only
And it floundered, it never really took off
It kind of flopped actually
So this isn't surprising to me at all
I'm surprised that they're actually going free-to-play
For me it would seem
That now they would be able to bring it
To Xbox Live
Because before they had
For some reason the infrastructure with
MMOs and stuff and subscriptions
Couldn't do it
I'm sorry but I call bullshit on Microsoft
Final Fantasy XI came out like
Six months after the Xbox was out
They were able to do this shit for years
Well then why haven't there been any MMOs on the console yet?
That's a damn good question
One I think Microsoft needs to answer
Final Fantasy XI did this shit
It was PC and 360 and
PlayStation 2 for fuck's sake
You know why I don't think there's been any MMOs?
Because there haven't really been any MMOs on consoles yet
But now
Sony releasing like DC Universe
And they're going to have the agency some year
Final Fantasy XIV
Well eventually Final Fantasy XIV
But if that stuff takes off
They're going to have to compete
But right now they had the MMO
Sony didn't have anything
And so now
Final Fantasy XI I don't think did too well
For them on 360
Because it had already been out
It's hard to just
The audience that would have been attracted
To Final Fantasy XI already had it
On the PlayStation 2 or on the PC
There were just very few
You know as Salacious Pop says
Cuckoo Bananas nerds for that game
Like me and like you Loki
That bought it
Because we had the PC version
But sometimes we wanted to play it on our TV
It did look really good on the TV
I'm not going to lie
Like if I was still into playing Final Fantasy XI
I'd probably be playing it on the 360
Home where I just live by myself now
And I could be using my TV as a giant computer
Like that I would totally be playing Final Fantasy XI
On the Xbox 360 if I was still
Playing that game
It, it, it
You know if that game went free to play
Yeah I got to admit if Final Fantasy XI
Went free to play I'd go back
I'd go back and if all my characters were still there
I'd be on like that I would download the client
I'd be on tomorrow I would
Not going to lie
That's scary, that's a scary thought
If you did that, bye bye 14
It doesn't even matter, don't even release it
Just forget it, just don't even worry about it
Just finish, keep adding to XI
When I tried to play
When I tried to play Champions Online last year
For like the free, when they
Because they came out with a free trial
Really relatively soon after the release
Because it was a flop
I was doing the City of Heroes
Thing playing with the controller and mouse
Or not controller, with the keyboard and mouse
Didn't like it, plugged in my
Xbox 360 controller
And all of a sudden all of the buttons
And the configuration for the controller, the integration
Was amazing, so you knew that
When this game came out
It had full, like it was ready to come out
On the Xbox, and even on the PC
Version you plug in an Xbox controller
And you can see how much better the game
Is with an Xbox controller
That's kind of how I feel about DC Universe
Ironically enough these two games somewhat similar
In the whole like super hero in the making thing
I wonder if this happening
Is somewhat of a response to DC Universe
Kind of now entering the market
And you know, it seems like quite a few
People are kind of jumping on board
And having played the beta test of the PC
Version of DC Universe, man
It was so much better when I plugged in the controller
And did it that way
So you know, you download the client
And you create your free account, you can play
It's
It's adopting
Sort of a freemium model
Where if you want to pay for the additional
Costume packs, or the weapons
Or powers
Or whatever, you can
Pay a la carte for that
However, if you're into the game enough
That you're willing to pay a $14.99
Subscription, which is what it is right now
You will automatically get that stuff as soon as
It's available, you'll have everything
So they're still offering
A subscription based
Service for people that
Are into the game enough that they want all the goodies
Or you can just play it
You know, run
Have it run with your WoW account
Do the, if you see one particular
Expansion that you like, pay for it a la carte
And otherwise it's free
So yeah, hopefully
This will help the game out, because I really like the
Superhero genre
And this game, I feel, never really got
A chance to succeed
Because of what Microsoft did too
Speaking of the superhero genre
Do you have any interest in DC Universe Online
That it's out?
This is gonna sound, I don't know if this is
Pretentious or what, but just the fact that it's DC
Like if Marvel came out with an MMO
I'd feel the same way
I just don't like the big names, I like the
Because City of Heroes has a huge
RP community in it, because it's so
Customizable
And it's not attached to any known
License, like DC is
But yeah, I'm gonna check this out now, now that it's free to play
Champions Online, absolutely, I'm gonna get it
Well you'll have to come back
And let us know how it is
Yes
Let's move on
So it's no surprise
That one of the best games
To be released for the Kinect
Has sold 1 million units in the US
That would be Dance Central
And also Kinect Sports
Both those games breaking the
1 million unit mark
Of course the Kinect hardware
Has sold 8 million units
Worldwide
And also
It's kind of neat to mention
And I don't think a lot of people know this yet
But in case you haven't picked up Dance Central
Or you're thinking of picking it up
You may want to wait a little bit
Because they're actually going to be doing a new
Skew that's going to be coming out to the market soon
That will give you, I guess, your first piece of
Download content for free
It's going to include a code for
240 Microsoft points bundled into the box
Ooh!
Like $3 for free
That's nice, one free song or whatever
Yeah, so
But yeah, the game is pretty awesome
I have to actually go back and play it
Now that I've got the living room
I need to play more of this but my apartment
Is too fucking small
It's kind of sad
But yeah, Dance Central is a fun time
And it's so funny because
Last night I was out at the club
And they were playing actually
A couple songs that I recognized from Dance Central
Like Evacuate the Dance Floor
So when Evacuate the Dance Floor started playing
I actually kind of started doing this in my seat
Evacuate the Dance
I was doing the whole little dance from
The game
That's what that was, I just thought you were drunk
I didn't know, I had no idea
No, that was the dance from Dance Central
And like you and Rice Princess and Xtaphir
I went out and got drunk with Xtaphir and Rice Princess
And Salacious Pop last night
And so you know
And Grandpa Warcraft for those who listen to Hoard House
That went out last night
We all went out and you know good times are had
And when that song came
And then what's the other song
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
I hate that song so much
I was doing the whole fist bumping thing
I know you want me
I know I want you
If that song was released by
Triumph the insult comic dog
Then it would be amazing, but it's not
The routine is pretty fun though
The thing about Dance Central
Is that as stinking cheesy as those dances are
You kind of start to remember them
After you play the game enough times
And I'm tempted to do it on the dance floor
That one's really weird
It's like a lot of jumping around
Good times
Something that won't be as easy to dance to
And you really really should not reenact
In real life at all
The kind of
I guess you could say
Very hard R rated
Mortal Kombat
Episodes that are going to be coming out soon
Okay you might remember there was this little
YouTube clip some time ago
That was like a concept video
For a Mortal Kombat movie reboot
And it was like imagine if Mortal Kombat
When all saw Anya
And it was really violent
And some big names were in this
Michael Jai White
Michael Jai White was Jax and TitsOf9
What's her name?
She was Sonya
Jerry Ryan was Sonya in this
And yeah
Sadly they're not going to make it a movie
That's not happening but what is going to happen
There's going to be some webisodes
A 10 part Mortal Kombat webisode series
I guess this is somewhat to promote
The new games that are coming out
So I wonder if that will somehow work together
Michael Jai White is going to come back
As Jax
However the website Bloody Disgusting
That reported on this because that's a website all about
The gore movies basically
They didn't say a whole lot about the storyline
So I imagine this is all just a part to kind of like
Pump up the release of the game
But we don't know a whole lot outside of that
So I guess it's neat
I'm not into the uber violence
You see like I like Mortal Kombat
Because it's cartoony violence
Like cartoony violence is funny to me
But I don't like the Saw movies
Like that just crosses the line
To me
So I don't know how I feel about this whole thing
Am I a hypocrite?
So let's just pop
Am I a hypocrite because I like Mortal Kombat
But I don't like Saw
A little
A little bit I don't know
I haven't really thought about it too much
One of them is cartoony though
I don't know it's different to me
We'll see
Weiland in our chatroom says that Michael Jai White
Has said those webisodes would lead into a movie
Well I'm sure it would be better than the movie
That had come out before it
Spazinator says anyone remember the short lived
Mortal Kombat TV show back in the 90's
Yeah
That was an intru- I remember that show
It was on the network here
That is now the CW
That used to just show all the
You know before there was a CW
Network they would show all the shows
Yeah no even before that
Because this show was on I want to say in the early
No I guess it was UPN
It was UPN at the time that's right
So it's just funny
Anyhow
We'll see what becomes of this Mortal Kombat
As we get closer to the game coming out
But for now we move on with more news
Slice pop
Okay so
Capcom is coming out with a system
For Marvel vs. Capcom 3
Where if you do the versus online mode
And you're playing some stranger
And he dunks on you really bad
And the only reason why he didn't get a perfect
On your ass is because you got in some block damage
And you say screw this
And quit
Well you're going to eventually rally up enough
Rage quit points or whatever
That you're going to be thrown into
Other random battles with other
Rage quitters
To discourage that type of behavior
So yeah
That is
Interesting I believe in
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom for the Wii
They have a similar system
You enter a random battle
In the middle of it because you're losing
Then once you finally get someone
That you can win a round on
Rage quit on you
And you guys can just all rage quit on each other
While the more serious competitors will
Take their random battles more seriously I guess
So yeah
That story
Came out last week
Sounds interesting
I wish they'd do this in WoW
I wish they'd do this in Grand Theft Auto
Does everyone seem to like this idea?
What if the rage quitting is beyond your control though?
What if it's like a legit connection failure?
If you're out in the boonies
And you only have like maybe satellite
As your only broadband option
Then yeah that might suck for you
But then again
You're still a problem for the people you're trying
To play against
You're still dropping out all the time
So maybe you do need to be paired with the rage quitters
They don't know that you dropped out
They just think you're a rage quitter anyway
So it's still your problem
With auto matches and stuff
But I would think that they would know
That I'm not rage quitting because I'm kicking the fucking
Ass out of them
And I'm in first place and then I drop
It's not like, oh dammit I'm doing too good
I'm leaving
Okay well we both see myself
Maybe a little bit
Just a tad
Let's travel around the world and look at release dates
For games that are coming out soon
More games that you can rage quit in
Yes this week is not too busy
But it doesn't fucking matter
Because there's only really one game you should pick up
And that would be LittleBigPlanet 2
Very excited that this game is coming out
And I can dust off my PS3 finally
And play this game
So it's pretty awesome
If you haven't played this game yet too
On Playstation 3 as well
Mass Effect 2 will be making its way out
And it's slightly
Polished
Mass Effect 3 engine
Along with all the download content
So that's kind of cool
That'll be out this week as well
Some other fun stuff coming out this week
Plants vs. Zombies on Nintendo DS
Which is a pretty awesome game
Mindjack is actually
Kind of a neat looking game
This is on Playstation 3 and 360 from Square Enix
Getting some comparisons
To Demon's Souls actually
Except for the, I don't think it's supposed to be
To the point where you want to
Blow your brains out hard
But
Apparently it's one of those games that
Has a persistent online
Portion of it where you can jump into other
People's games and play as the villains
Nice, I love that idea
So yeah
That's something that's coming out this week which is pretty cool
And then
What else
Oh Spellforce 2
Faith and Destiny I guess is a PC title that's coming out
This week as well as Fanatica on PC
That was a little bit of a holdover
But that's it, really a small week
I bet you anything there's going to be a Demon's Souls 2
Announced at E3 this year
Oh there will be a Demon's Souls 2
That game sold incredibly well for them
I remember though, I actually played that at E3
Before it came out and there wasn't a whole lot of buzz around it
But I remember playing that demo early on
Thinking it was a pretty neat little game
But I didn't know about all these other features
Until after the game had come out
It was hard to get that from a demo
Playing it on the show floor
I bet you there's another one coming out this year
It's going to be interesting
I'd say I'd check it out
But unfortunately games cost $60
So if I'm not able to rent it first or try it
I don't know
Give it some time
Especially since it's packed in between
LittleBigPlanet 2 and
Dead Space 2
A lot of people aren't going to realize that this game is out
And they'll probably drop the price rather quick
We'll see
Let's move to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates
We have Kinect Joyride coming out on the 360
As well as Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom
Both come out on the 20th of this month
On 360
So they're getting some of their Kinect localized titles
A little later than we had them here
That also comes out by the way on the Playstation 3
Not Kinect of course, but Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom
Comes out from Namco Bandai
This game
I'm trying to think if I've heard of this here in the US
And I know I've seen a trailer for this
And it actually looks pretty awesome
Loki, what is this game called here?
It's from Namco
And it's like Overworld
There's a giant following you
It's called Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom
Is this called the same game here?
It came out over the end of November
What? I missed this game?
Yes you did
This looks kind of neat
How well received was it?
I don't know
It dropped in price a bunch of times
Right before it came out
I think it was only a $40 game
I might have to check that out
So many games came out at the end of last year
I forgot about it because
Was it
Operation Black
Black Ops
Something like that
Assassin something or other
Creed, Brotherhood
Alright also coming out on Playstation 3
This is a price reduction of a game that's already been out
It comes in the best series now
Ryugago Toku
4 Densetsu
Sugimono
You might know this game as Yakuza 4
Same game there and that's getting a big price reduction
On the Playstation 3 this week
Going to some other systems like the
Nintendo Wii
Sengoku Mosuo 3
Gets a price reduction this week
Momotaro Densetsu
2010 Sengoku Ishin no Hiro
Das Yugo
Gets a price
I think that's a price reduction as well this week
So lots and lots of things getting cheaper
I'm trying to see what this game is
This looks kind of like a train station
These train games are very popular
Over there in Japan so it's another train simulator
Game that is
Getting a price reduction there
Starting to see some stuff for the
3DS forming in Japan
Can't talk about it until February 26
But that's starting to show up on my list so that's kind of exciting
But if you want to go back to the regular DS
Zombie Daisuke comes out this week
As well as yet another price
Reduction for Gaikuten
Kenji comes out
Also Plants vs. Zombies
I guess comes out in the US this week
And that is actually getting some
Import over in Japan believe it or not
Also a huge huge release
On the PSP this week
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep
Final Mix
So it's kind of like the game redone with the extra stuff
Including anything we got here
In the US that they didn't get over there
One other game on the PSP dimension
Venus and Braves
Majo to Megami to Horiobi
no Yugen comes out from Bandai Namco
This week as well
So there you go
Venus Braves by the way is
What that series is known as
That's it for Japanese releases
How about the UK?
Alright for UK releases I'm going to take it back
A couple days just to remind everybody
In the great old Britain
That DC Universe Online
Came out on the 14th
On both PC and
Playstation 3
And also a game called Ghost Trick
For the DS that was January 14th
And Kingdom Hearts
Recoded as well on the DS on the
January 14th
For this upcoming week we have on the
January 17th
Monday Night Combat for the PC
On the 21st
We have LittleBigPlanet 2
For the PS3
Mass Effect 2 for the PS3
And Mind Jack for the
Xbox 360 and
Playstation 3
All of next week
On the 21st
You know what's funny about those releases
Is that I almost pretty much heard the same stuff
When Loki was talking
And you don't see that a lot
Usually the UK will get their stuff late
Yeah so that's pretty cool
That a lot of this stuff is coming out in tandem
So if I were living overseas I'd be pretty happy
Right now to hear that
Alright well let's move on with a couple more stories
And then the classic game of the week
I know Dark Soccer is not here tonight
We're gonna get to the classic game of the week in just a little bit
But first two more news stories for you guys
Yes unfortunately the Wii
Always gets shit on when it comes
To download content
And that seems to be what's going on this time
The Rock Band Network
Which is releasing a bunch of indie tracks
On the Xbox 360
And I believe they were getting a few
You know ported over to
The PS3 and Wii well that's gonna
Stop at least on the Wii
It says with a smaller install
Base, limited demand for releases
So far and the significant amount of work
It takes for our producers and audio team
To convert and process
These additional tracks
We are no longer able to
Continue submitting Rock Band Network content
To the Wii
So to summarize
Or in other words no one's fucking buying
It so we're gonna stop making it
It says regular Wii DLC
And Rock Band Network releases for the 360
And PS3 will continue uninterrupted
Honestly
Truthfully I think the Wii owners are lucky
To be getting any DLC at all
Like with how crappy Nintendo's
Online front end is compared to their competitors
I am I honestly think
Harmonix is graceful
And generous in the amount of content
That they do put out on the Wii
And like I realize that a lot of people own a Wii
And a lot of people have this game on the Wii
But I think they more than support
Their game like better than
Probably any other fucking company
Does on the Wii
Well at least on the Wii though you get some Rock Band stuff
This week on the 18th
You get the main drag
How we look on paper
Wounded Soul RX
Band of Horses
The Great Soul Lake
Firewind Head of High
Seton Clausen
The Soul Side
White Heat
OK Go with White Knuckles
Alright
Moving on
This makes me very happy because I
Loved all these old school PC
Games back in the day
Apparently there's a new web app
That allows you to play Sierra
Online games on your iPad
In related news
I'm gonna go buy an iPad
Like ASAP
I wonder if it will work on the iPhone
But I don't know it might be a little hard to play on the iPhone
Alright here's the deal
The website
Is called Sarian.net
It's made
The Sierra Online adventure games
That they have like Space Quest, Kings Quest
And Leisure Suit Larry
You can play them on the iPad
All you have to do is go to the website
S-A-R-I-E-N.net
And do this before they get that season desist letter loaded on them
You can go on there and you can play
These games on the iPad
And it looks like the way this works
Is a lot of the words kind of show up
On the bottom of the screen so you can kind of touch them
To put the words in and what have you
Uh yeah
That's basically the deal
Man that's great if I had an iPad
I'd be checking that out right now
In fact I might try it on my iPhone
But I'm guessing it doesn't work nearly as well
Because you don't have quite the same real estate
So there you go
I wonder how they're getting away with this
I guess it's just kind of one of those
Intel they get the season desist letter
They're just gonna do it
On the internet everybody has it
I don't know
S-S-A-R-I-E-N.net.net says wait for iPad 2
It comes with electric boogaloo
That's from our chatroom chat.orangelsageradio.com
I am gonna actually wait for uh
iPad 2
I do want to wait for that
Because it'll have the front facing cam
And all the other frills and stuff
Yeah I enjoy whenever we go to the mall
And we pass the Apple store
I was like hey Rob go get your iPad
Just impulse buy it right now
These days I'm gonna do it
And then you're gonna be like I was kidding
I ain't really mean for that to happen
Well you know when the iPad 2 is announced
The prices of those iPad 1's are gonna
Plummet. Like they're gonna go down to
Two, three hundred dollars
I have so many friends that work at the Apple
Mothership down in
Where is that?
I don't even know
Well all your friends work there shouldn't you know?
Cupertino here
And whenever the new generation of
iPods come out
Within their internal employee store
Cause they get mark downs on that
Dirt cheap I've gotten two iPods that way
Nice
Well except you'll want a new one
No I want one of the new fancy pants ones
I don't want that old shit I want the new one
So I can do drunken FaceTime cause that's the only reason you use FaceTime
Is when you're rip-roaring drunk which I didn't do last night
Oddly enough but anyway
FaceTime is best for like drunk
Dialing it's drunk dialing for a new century
Is what it is
There you go
And to answer your question
Yes you can play it on an
iPod but
It's hard
Why is it hard?
It's small because you have to type in text on the bottom here
Oh yuck
But you can do it you can click around
Cause it supports the
Safari
Wow that's kinda cool
Alright question from our chat
Room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com
Live here on this Sunday evening
Dark Tetsuya says Rob you gonna wait for the 3DSI?
No I'm getting the 3DS right
When it comes out and I bet a lot of you
Skeptic folks the first time you see the 3DS
You're gonna be like holy shit it really is 3D
Without glasses and you'll probably buy it too
I'm really not trying to sound
Like a fanboy like don't get me wrong
Nintendo pisses me off more than they usually make me happy
But the 3DS
It's a pretty fantastic piece of technology
Like I'm almost excited to get it for
And I know this is gonna sound weird cause I'm
Not a fan of 3D movies but like
The 3D on the DS doesn't really bother me
I'm excited to see what kind of 3D movies
Come out on the DS
If Tron Legacy comes out in 3D
On the DS on the 3DS
Like I'm there
Hello
Seriously don't you want that?
So
Hell yes I want that
Alright let's get to the classic
Game of the week here at Orange Lounge Radio
We do a segment every week called the classic
Game of the week and it has a little theme
Song
And this is the part of the week where DarkSakura
Dives into her vault and she drags out
A classic video game and she says hey
You ungrateful brats this is a game
That you should be playing this week but guess what?
She ain't here so we've hijacked
The classic game of the week segment this week
And we're allowing her fill in tonight
SalaciousPop to choose a
Classic game of the week that he thinks
You guys should be playing because you know
DarkSakura love her to bits
And she does pick a lot of Sega stuff
So we thought maybe SalaciousPop could pick something
That DarkSakura maybe would not pick
I made sure that I'm not
Stepping on DarkSakura's toes on the whole
Console classic
So I picked a PC classic
Namely King's Quest 4
The Perils of Rosella
How appropriate considering the last story
Off of the Sierra Online story we just finished up
Wonderful choice
Let's see if we can get some music here
A single tear rolling down my face right now
At the title screen music
This is the fourth
In the series obviously
Came out August 16th
1988 for MS-DOS
Amiga
Apple 2GS
And Atari ST
PC platforms
I remember playing this game
With my friend in junior high
Across I think 9
5 and a quarter inch floppies
And you could install it to your hard drive
And hard drives back then were like 40 megabytes
If you were lucky
Or you could move
To the next screen and it'll say
Insert disk 6
Insert disk 7
So it was a game like that
I loved this game
Because it was the last
In the King's Quest series
That used the traditional text based
Input system
Like look under bridge
Search room all that stuff
King's Quest 5
Adopted the new mouse cursor
Engine
So King's Quest 4 the last
Traditional text based King's Quest game
Takes place immediately
After the events of
King's Quest 3
You play Rosella
The daughter of King Graham
Of Daventry
King Graham in the opening sequence has a heart attack
The magic mirror tells you
You need to be ported away to
A magical world
To Tamir
To find this fruit
And if King Graham can eat the fruit he will not die
And this game had an internal timer
You had to get the fruit and make it back
To King Graham within a certain amount of game time
Or else he would die and it would be game over
So you had to figure out the puzzles relatively quickly
At some point
It turned to night
And everything got dark
There were certain puzzles that you could only
Like there was an abandoned mansion
There was nothing to do there
Unless you went there at night when it was haunted
Because the puzzles didn't light up
Until it was dark
So you had to
Do everything else and then
That was the last place you went to
While it was still nightfall
It had multiple endings
It was possible to
Survive the
Dangers of Tamir and escape the
Evil witch Lalote
And make it back
To King Graham without actually getting
The fruit
So you had to be
Able to figure out where it was
What items you needed to
Get the item and then
You know, survive the evil
The antagonist, the evil witch
And then give him the food in the end
So it had multiple endings which was pretty
Innovative at the time
I think EGA graphics
But the pixels were a lot smaller
Than the traditional King's Quest games
So visually even for EGA graphics
16 color
Stunning, and the music of course
With the King's Quest 4 I believe
Was one of the first Sierra games that actually
Used sound cards
Instead of just the beep beep beep beep
Good old ad lib
I had an ad lib back in the day
King's Quests, I want to say 1 through 3
Or maybe 1 and 2
Just use your internal speaker
The loud harsh beeps
Sound card support
So amazing game
Also like most
Of the King's Quest games it was possible
To miss an item that you needed
To not die or to
Kill the big bad at the end
If you missed that puzzle
If you let Cupid fly away from the little pool
Without getting his cupid's bow and arrow
And you saved your game, you were screwed
Couldn't beat it, sorry try again
So yeah
Great game
So many people think so fondly
Of 4 specifically, like you asked
Most people what's your favorite King's Quest game
And most people, including myself, would say
4 was the best, period
Out of a what, 8 game series
Most people would say 4 is the best
I rejected the reality
And where it ate is real
7
Fine, some might argue 9
If you count this fan silver lining at this point
But why is it, regardless of how many
You think there are
Why is it that 4 is the one that's so fond
And meet people's hearts
I mean, again, I'm sure there's people listening to this show going
No, 5 was my favorite, or you know, 1 was the best
Why 4? So many people that I know at least
Um
Visually, at the time, people just
Never saw a game that was that beautiful
On PC gaming
It really took EGA graphics
As far as they literally could go
Without stepping up to VGA 256 colors
Um, so just visually
People just remember how awestruck they were
When they saw it
And they loaded up the game
When you first arrive on that beach
And you can see the wave of the ocean
Up against, you know, the yellow sand
The sound card support
To actually have ad-lib music coming at you through your speakers
Um
And I think the nostalgia of
Text-based RPGs
Cause it was the last one in that series
King's Quest V and VI were all mouse-based
I think for me, a big part of it too was in the story
It seemed like a lot of it was inspired by
Fables, Aesop's Fables, like Hansel's and Gretel's
Type of thing, I think that is very
Fond as well for me, I think that's why
I grabbed it for IV
King's Quest has always had that a little bit, but yes
There were a lot of great
Meta genre references
Particularly in IV
Um, the three hags that represent
The three fates that all share one eye
And you had to catch their eyes
So they were blind, otherwise they were gonna eat you
That was in King's Quest IV
Um, you find a
Gold ball and you throw it into a pond
And you have to kiss the frog, like the
Princess and the frog, that's in King's Quest IV
So a lot of, yeah, classic fairy tale
Um, homages are in
In this particular title
Man, I really wish this series would come back
And yes, I understand there's the fan project
And I mean no disrespect, they're doing a
Wonderful, wonderful thing, and they've
Taken so much shit for what is really
Like, a thing that they love, and you know
So I'm definitely not slamming that at all
But I really wish somebody would just
Give people lots of money
To make a big budget return
Of King's Quest, you know what I mean?
How awesome would that be?
Well, there have been fan service, um
VGA or SVGA remakes of the first three
Sure, sure
That are completely independent and they run great
But I mean, just like now with today's technology
And games and so forth with, you know, like
The DVD and Blu-ray technology and stuff
Like, I would just love to see, like, a really
Well done new King's Quest game
That's just, you know, like
I don't know, I don't even know how to explain it
Like, just that whole kind of world
I want to go back to that, you know
Yeah, yeah
I don't know, and again, I realize Silver Lining
Can kind of take me there, but Silver Lining
Is also very much in that same vein
Of what we remember, but I'd like to see
Someone kind of like take King's Quest, that series
And bring it to today's technology
Big budget type of game
The closest thing I think we got was the longest
Journey and the longest journey 2
Completely different franchise and story
And company, but when that game, cause
There was a point in the
There was, I think, a sort of a
A shift in what people wanted
On PC gaming, I think around
Maybe the early, mid 90's
Where adventure games were boring
People didn't like them anymore
Cause Doom came in
And PC became about first person shooters
And then Half-Life and all that
And the Sierra style of games, Space Quest
King's Quest, were sort of left in the wake
You would think though, with all the nostalgia
Wank that happens out there in the world
Though that there would be room for this
And I realize that's kind of where Telltale
Kind of has their market right now
And they do a very good job at what they do
But I'm just surprised
Especially when that whole silver lining stuff
Was going on, that uh, who owns a license now?
Activision I guess, who got it from Vivendi
Has basically said, you know what
We don't want to revisit that world
And that's not just King's Quest
That's Space Quest, that's uh
Police Quest, Quest for Glory
Quest for Glory, all that stuff
And it's just, I don't know, it's just kind of annoying
Cause I would really like to see some of that come back
This is gonna sound a little elitist
And maybe I'm a bit proud
That this is elitist
These games, probably too hard
For kids these days
They were hard, you could save your game and just
Screw up, you had to start all the way over
That stuff doesn't fly now
And for it to be a true King's Quest
Or Space Quest game, it would need to be hard
As hell, you would need to be able to
You know?
You didn't fail, sorry
You didn't throw the boot at the cat
So now the mouse isn't gonna rescue you
In King's Quest V, so lol, 15 hours of your life
You have to do over
That won't fly anymore
That's true
Everybody wants the easy button now
Alright, well if you want to go
See how we had it when we were young
You ungrateful kids, go check out
King's Quest IV, The Perils of Rosella
Because it was just one of the best
King's Quest games they ever did
I believe this was ported to a variety of consoles
It's not just PC
I mean, clearly the PC is the best one
But if you must, I believe it was on the NES
Wasn't it?
V was, V was ported
I thought IV was on the NES too
Yeah, V was the one
Also, you can get the King's Quest collection
And Space Quest collection on Steam
It comes with DOSBox
Which is that sort of indie MS-DOS
Emulator that's fully inclusive of all that
Stuff that will run on Windows 7
That includes, of course
This game, King's Quest IV
For about 20 bucks on Steam
For whatever reason, it's never
On sale, so I think the licensing
For it is very bare bones
Where Activision is like, here's this
DOSBox emulated
Comp of these old ass games
And we're not letting you put it on sale
Ever
Steam never really
Features it on the RPG page
You have to literally search for it in the Steam client
King's Quest collection
But you can get it, yeah
If anybody's still using GameTap, I think a lot of those games
Are on there too
Good old games, GOG might have some of these too
Yeah, absolutely
Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says, Westwood also put out
The Chirandia series of adventure games
Just reminded me of another great series
That was one Loki really liked too, if I remember right
Yes, I did
Specifically Chirandia, The Hands of Fate
Alright, well that's gonna do it for our
Classic game of the week
Very good pick, Alan, very well done
I'm sure DarkSakura would be proud
We'll ask her when she gets back
But we are gonna take a quick break, but don't worry
There's plenty more OLR to come
We're gonna get to some rapid fire news
Twitter topics of course, if you haven't submitted
Your tweets tonight, you should get those in at
Twitter.com slash OLR
We've got a lot of stuff about the 3DS
We haven't even got to yet
And some other stuff on the PSP too
But not just that, because we'll talk about that
Dreamcast collection, and if
Everything goes bad in Part B, don't worry
Mama will fix it. This is right, another
Cookie Mama story coming up in Part B
So we'll be right back you guys with a little more of
Orange Lounge Radio, don't go anywhere

In front of that. Also if you like World
Of Warcraft, you might wanna check out my show
Horde House, that tapes every Thursday
There might be a live episode
This week, we are working on that
I'm gonna try and hammer out the
Details, I don't know exactly
How that's gonna work cause I gotta make sure if
It's gonna be at all games we have to respect
There are other shows that already have time slots
So we're gonna try to make that happen
This week
One off thing, we're not always live though, and if you like
That, Xtafer is my co-host
There and he's pretty hilarious and
We talk a lot about World of Warcraft and all that good stuff
So check that out, we don't really have
A website for that yet, but you can find us on
iTunes at Horde House, or if you go to
OrangeLaundry.com, the main site for
Our show, there are little buttons that link you to
Our side projects right there, it's great
So check it out
Alright, let's move on to some quick news
And we'll get to Twitter topics
In just a minute, so last call for some Twitter topics
At Twitter.com slash
O-L-R while we do some rapid fire news
As part of that
Whole Mega Man
Legends 3 meta thing that they have going on
Where basically the fans
Decide
You know
Different aspects of Mega Man
Well it came down to voice actresses
Or actors
For the Mega Man role
And it was up to the vote
Of fans and 3000 people voted
And it looks like
That your Mega Man voice
Actress is going to be
Akimi Kondra
And I guess
She was the voice actress
That did work in
Mega Man X command mission
And powered up, and I guess she's also
Done work in Persona 4, Fatal Frame 2
And Clonad
That's pretty cool
And I guess Mega Man Legends 3
Is headed to the 3DS
Another reason to own a 3DS
Fucking Mega Man
Legends
The Dreamcast collection
Something that's been rumored for a while
Is actually coming out on PC
And Xbox 360
This February
I gotta admit though it's not too exciting
It's really just a collection of
The titles that are coming out on Xbox Live
Arcade
Crazy Taxi, Sonic Adventure
Sega Bass Fishing, and Space Channel 5
Part 2
To enhance up res graphics
Apparently it's going to retail for $30
And it'll be out on
February 22nd
Is that something that you'd be interested in
Rob, since you know it does have Space Channel 5
Of course, I hella want
Space Channel 5
I wouldn't buy the collection, I'd just buy
Space Channel 5 when it comes out on
Xbox Live Arcade
That's what made my ears perk up
Because
Sonic Adventure, I heard that port wasn't
Very good, Crazy Taxi's missing a lot of the
License stuff, Sonic Adventure just wasn't very good
So, you can port it all you want
It's Sega Bass Fishing, I just
Don't give a shit about that, so you know
Um
And this is a
Juicy rumor here, apparently
You know, the uh
Well actually
I'm jumping ahead here, you are a little bit
Sorry, must have missed the link
There, no, this is actually a juicy
Rumor, it's actually coming in the form of
Slurpees
They're going to be doing some sort of promotion
Now with LittleBigPlanet 2 and Killzone 3
Where you can go buy Slurpees
And at your local
7-Eleven
And you'll be able to get different
I guess
Prizes
Or codes that you can
Redeem for things, they're going to have
Strategy guides, premium themes
Download content, and more
No word if they're
Going to actually have any sort of special
Flavors to go along with them
I almost wanted to stop at
7-Eleven on the way here, because it's like
Ooh, Slurpee
That's good stuff
Alright, Slurpees are amazing
But lots of calories
So for those of you that are trying to do
Diets for the new year, I'd stay
Away from Slurpees, just saying
But they're really good
I love the Pina Colada ones
Yeah, I was just about to bring that up
So gross
He'll get the large Slurpee of the flavor
I think Coconut is vile
So he will get the Pina Colada to guarantee
That I won't try to, you know, Bogart it from him
I love Coconut, like I love McCroons
Are like my favorite cookie ever
And then Coconut Cream Pie is so amazing
Oh my gosh
Coconut's very high in fat though, just saying
If I cook something awesome, then I just have to put
That'll guarantee that it's mine
And Rob won't try to eat it
I hate mayonnaise
Even today, we were at Panera Bread, Loki's favorite restaurant
We decided to go to Panera Bread for the show
It's not my favorite restaurant
Right here at OLR it is
What have I been eating the last two weeks?
French onion soup
No, I have not been eating French onion soup
I have been having
Was it a ten piece
The Honey Hot BBQ Wings
From KFC
With a giant root beer
Without ice, because I do not want my
Root beer watered down by crappy ice
How dare they
How dare they steal some of my
Precious root beer room with ice
I don't know what it is
But A&W from an A&W
Or even the combination KFC A&W
Like they have out here is so much better
Than the ones at the store, I can't explain it
A&W from the tap is so much better
They sell them in gallon jugs
I swear to god
I can drink a half gallon
I can do it
I've seen them
They are seriously
It's a sight to behold
I tell you man
I took Salacious Pop to Panera for the first time today
He really liked it
I guess they don't have them in his neck of the woods
Kind of a new thing
People on Facebook have said there is a bunch around me
But in the neighborhood I'm in there aren't any
I've never seen one
What's ironic is
It took the place of a Krispy Kreme
It's kind of one extreme to the other
I know and that is crime right there
Really they should have just
They should have tore down another restaurant
Get rid of the Wendy's
Wendy's sucks and everything
Alright let's get back to gaming news
Yet again the food topic
I don't even know what to say
We have a release date for PlayStation Move Heroes
It's March 22nd
Some bonuses that come with the reservations
Depending on where you reserve it
Amazon and Gamestop
You can get a skin pack with Pirate Sly
Freedom League Jack and
Trillium Armor Ratchet
Is all the special stuff you can get there
Apparently quote
There's also a full story surrounding the game
And why they're all together
That is from Christian Cardona
The marketing manager of the game
PlayStation Move Heroes
I have yet to buy a PlayStation Move
Super Street Fighter 4 3D
Is coming out of course on the 3DS
Online multiplayer
That's pretty neat
There was a whole little trailer too that hit the internet this week
That was showing some of the features like that
But there's also going to be worldwide online play
And what's called channel live
You can just watch live matches
And channel live if you want to watch the pros do their thing
There's also figurine collecting
And random street fighting modes
If you want to do that
That's that whole using the aware thing
As you walk by people
I guess your character can fight somebody else
That's going to be a pretty big launch title
Even though most of us have already played Super Street Fighter 4
My question is
And maybe this has already been answered somewhere
I just haven't seen it
How has the character roster been affected by the move to the 3DS
I mean surely they had to cut some characters out right
Or did they not
Wow that's pretty amazing
The videos and the YouTubes that have been out of this game
Have blown my mind on how good it looks
So if for it to look that good
If they cut a few characters
In order for that to happen I do not mind
There's some awesome stuff coming out on that game right now
Yeah I'm trying to see if there's a 3DS thing
Let's see
It's coming out, it has Wi-Fi
It has all 35 console characters plus
Yeah all of them are going to be on the 3DS release
It's been called exactly the same as its HD counterparts by Capcom
That's pretty amazing
You can set up four hotkeys
For moves and combos on the touch screen
That's kind of interesting
Can I go on the tangent train a little bit?
Of course
I really hope that this generation of handhelds
Be it the 3DS or the PSP2
Uses more of the infrastructure central server style of multiplayer
Because the last few generations
Obviously you've got the Game Boy Advance with the link up cable
That was the last generation that used that
With the PSP and the DS
It's all ad hoc
I don't know that many people that have a PSP
Where I can be in the same room with them
And do ad hoc connect
So I really want this generation
Super Street Fighter 4 3DS
To have the central server
And I know with the PS3 and the PSP
You can do the tethering
But that's still just too cumbersome for me
It's too much of a pain in the ass I agree
So I love handhelds
But I'll never play ad hoc support
Because I don't know that many friends with them
So that's all
Let's talk about another fighting game on the 3DS
Dead or Alive Dimensions
It's kind of interesting because they've talked about
This game is going to have 30 frames a second and 60 frames a second
It just depends on if you're playing 3D or 2D
So if you're playing in 3D mode
You only get 30 frames a second per eye
But if you decide to condense it down to 2D
You'll get a 60 frames a second fighter
That's kind of interesting
I mean it makes sense too
Because obviously 3D is rendering one frame
And then another really fast back and forth
In rapid succession
They look pretty good in 3D
But that's pretty cool that if you get sick of 3D
There's kind of like a little perk if you will
To play in 2D
Kind of neat
I'm sure a lot of games are like that by the way
Yeah same with Street Fighter IV on there
Because they have that really funky view that you can do
That gives it more depth
But if you don't want to do that
You don't have to do that
Salacious Pop has a few stories for us
Then we're going to get to the Twitter topics
Real quick though
It seems to be kind of smart in Nintendo's part
At least, well I don't know if it's Nintendo's part
But as far as like
The games that are coming out launched
You know for it and stuff
It seems to be kind of quite a variety
It's not all like, oh it's Mario this
Or you know Zelda this
And all kitty stuff
It's like we've got some hardcore fighters in there
We've got a little bit of
You know the Nintendogs kind of crap
And a little bit of
Something for everybody
I think that's pretty awesome
Indeed, it sounds like it's going to have
A pretty good lineup at the beginning
I hope the price is reasonable
We'll see pretty soon though
Alright Salacious Pop
Okay
For my quick fire stories
Those of you who wanted to play
Pac-Man Battle Royale
The Return to Form
Pac-Man arcade game multiplayer
That is now available to
American arcade distributors
So that means that whatever arcade
If you're fortunate enough to live in an area
That still has one
They can have it
It's a cocktail style cabinet
You know the old pizza parlor
Model to set your drink on it
So it's the flat glass
Coming soon to Dave and Busters everywhere I'm sure
Yeah
According to the source of the article
Arcade Heroes
It's currently being sold
For $4,275
To the arcade businesses
That might want to get it and put it in the store
Or in their arcade
Which apparently is cheaper
Than most of the other stuff
Most arcade games right now that are popular
Are the ticket spitters
And the big time crisis
The huge shoot-em-up
Arcade games
So the Pac-Man
Battle Royale cocktail cabinet
A little over $4,000 I guess
For a new arcade machine
So yeah
Pac-Man fans look for that in your arcade
Starting hopefully as soon as this month
Because it's out there for us to buy it
So
Next
The domain name
FinalFantasy13-2game.com
Has been registered by Squeenix
So everyone's all
Freaking out about what this means
Maybe Lightning is going to become a pop singer
Just like What's-Her-Name
Final Fantasy X
So yeah
That was registered
Along with a bunch of other domains
For their
N-I-E-R
Nier
Nier and Mindjack
So a bunch of domains were registered
For those properties
Square is holding a
First production
Party premiere event in Japan
For two days on the 18th
So people are like what titles
And little side story
Projects are they going to announce
Maybe we'll finally get to see something from
Final Fantasy 13 Versus
Which very well could be just being released here
As Final Fantasy 13-2
Versus 13 for the PS3
And then the Fabula
The PSP
Part of the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy
Those two titles are still
I don't want to call them vaporware
We know that they exist
So there's that
Maybe we'll find out about
Kingdom Hearts 3
Maybe
Maybe we'll find out
That would be a great E3 announcement though
Final Fantasy 7
Remake maybe
I'm just flame baiting at this point
Maybe we'll find out about Final Fantasy 14
Do-Over
The Do-Over expansion
If they said they were doing Final Fantasy 6
The 3DS
Then I would
That would be enough for me
So Square is having some event in two days
And they registered 13-2 game
Final Fantasy 13-2.com
So speculate to your heart's content
Last quick fire story for me
Is that some of the retail
Marketing assets
For Marvel versus Capcom 3
Have Akuma
On them as a playable character
It's just a print
Assets for the game
And I guess apparently Akuma
Hasn't been really made official
On that roster
Well I would kind of think duh Akuma is in it
But I guess this is the first time we've seen
Akuma in print material
For MVC 3
Geez do we have the full roster yet?
Because it seems like every week there's some damn story about
Oh this character is in it
Well in this little
Sample graphic here it's got Akuma
On Bonn which we already knew about
Albert Wesker, I don't know if I knew about him
Yeah he was announced
A while ago. And then Arthur of course
From Ghosts and Goblins
So yeah
So we know that Akuma
Is at least in print material for the game
So maybe he's unlockable
But he's in there
Alright we'll see
For now let's go to the Twitter
We're going to get some tweets
Every week we ask you guys to show us your tweets
At twitter.com slash o-l-r
And we're going to read some messages
Sent to us right now
We'll start off with Spassinator PSN
Send us a couple tweets here
There's been a ton of free stuff put onto the PSN
Video store lately
The usual spot so be sure to check it out
So if you like free videos
You can check that out
Hopefully your console doesn't get borked if you try to hack it
And then you'll lose that rights to all that video content
So be careful
Retertainment, I like this tweet
Which console would compete better on Jeopardy?
The 360
The PS3
Or the Wii
Cause you know if you haven't heard there's that whole computer
That's going on Jeopardy that's supposed to be doing battle
Against what like Ken Jennings
And I don't know somebody else
Whatever
So I don't know, what do you guys think?
Which console would compete best on Jeopardy?
I would guess the Playstation 3
Because of that whole
Uber chip that's inside it
It's kind of got the best
Computer parts
If you will
Well the 360 would call Alex Trebek a fag
And then the panel would go red
The right on screen
It would go red and then it would just sit there
For the rest of the show
And Alex Trebek would be like
So yeah
And then the Wii
The Wii couldn't even connect to the internet
To be able to play the game
I'm gonna say the PS3
Act Def sends us a link to a story
About a video game pirate trades
Sales for Steam
It's a link to a story on Kotaku
About a video game pirate who has reformed
And wrote this whole story
I'm not gonna read the whole damn story
But he you know
Wrote this whole little piece for Kotaku
And talked about how he was a pirate
And a thief and so forth
He said near the end of 2010
He had stopped playing PC games all together
And if he ended up liking a game
He wouldn't even bother to order it
He'd just keep playing it until he beat it and then move on
Then Steam I guess changed his mind
He has been a user on Steam for five years
And then
He would I guess wake up during the holiday sale
And see what games he's going to buy
Having the convenience of Steam
To download games right there
Was enough for him
He bought 22 games over the course of the sale
There you go
I guess the 3DS too is something else that's
Making him reform
You can read the whole piece there on Kotaku
Another link sent to us on Twitter
From SJ100Matt says
It's a link about a group of fans remaking
Sonic 2 in HD
This is yet another one of those things
Where I remember one of these
Not that long ago there was a story about
A Sonic game that was being like remade
Or like a whole new HD Sonic game
That looked better than Sonic 4
I think Jamie had the story
And she was reporting on it
And what Sega's putting out
And now there's this whole little teaser on YouTube
I guess for a remade
Sonic 2 in HD
Now it just looks like old school Sonic
But in widescreen and high def
It looks great
Why the fuck isn't this on Xbox Live?
I can't
I love how all the fans
Try to one-up Sega though
It's like at what point does
Flattery become insult
Like seriously I don't even know
Defective Candy sends us a tweet
The first kinetic app
Has shown up in the Mac App Store
It's called the Connect 3D Viewer
App and you can plug the USB Connect
Into the app
I'm sorry into your Mac and you get a
3D visualization of the depth
Data you can also map
RGB values on the image
You can zoom and rotate the
Visualization so it kind of looks like an
Old school like Max Headroom thing from the 80's
In this little clip you see there
Yeah now that the Mac App Store is open
People are putting all sorts of creative things
Up on there so that's interesting
If I had a Mac I'd probably be checking that out
Unfortunately I only have an iPhone
And I can't hook up my connect to my iPhone
Let's see
Tigerclaw305 on Twitter sends us a few
Tweets, one of them has to do
This whole thing about the
Hacking of the Playstation 3
Apparently there's something going on there that's threatening the
Trophy system
The PS3 Unlocker is this app that's out there
You can only use it on a jailbroken
Console and I guess what happens is that
You can actually unlock trophies for
Buzz, Quiz, TV, Disc
You get 100% of the trophies
But not every game works like Resident Evil 5
Gold Edition and Batman Arkham Asylum
Don't work yet
So wow
That sucks actually
For Sony if that happens
Because there's just going to be so many people
That abuse that and it's too bad
They could easily ban those people
That do that. They do that for Xbox
Live right now because you can do that already
With JTAG consoles
But I mean
You can tell
Usually you can tell
Hey he has a 2 million
Gamer score
That's a little weird
Probably a little high
I enjoy metagaming and the whole
Semi-EP'ing achievement point thing
WoW has it, Xbox has it
I think it's neat but I just
Can't imagine who is taking this seriously
Enough to where they want to hack themselves
Up into the 50,000 score
So they can go hey look at my gamer card
Look at my score
Who is that person because I want to meet them and maybe
Push them down some stairs
Yeah I mean it's like you know
Big fucking deal, like woo
You unlocked everything and you did it by cheating
It's unfortunate
Someone who does it legitimately
Gets some really cool
Achievement but you know
The person who unlocks the most
Maximum achievements in one game
Isn't good at every single game
And that's okay
It's just like in the Olympics the same competitors
Don't do every single sport
Unless you're looking at something like the Decathlon
But that's different
And XBLA will occasionally feature
A gamer on Xbox Live that has a really
High number, sometimes it'll be
An Iraqi vet
That's now disabled and they play Xbox
With a 50,000 XBLA score
And that's interesting to find out about the people
That have numbers that high because they just
Play that much
And a hack like this kind of takes away from
The few people that you know
Have made a name for themselves out of metagaming
So yeah
So stopping a dick basically folks
This is just a dick thing to do is to unlock all the trophies
That you didn't earn
Dick, alright
Moving on to another tweet, the last tweet tonight
Also from Tigerclaw
I guess is going on there
Epic Games has an upcoming first person shooter
Called Bulletstorm
I guess the Xbox Live and Playstation Network
Demo is coming out on January 25th
If you want to check this out and see if this is the game for you
The demo will have
Usage of the echo mode
It's a score based mode in the game
Where you can use skill shots
And so forth
45 of the game skill shots will be in there
As well as a range of weapons
So it sounds like you'll be able to get a pretty good taste for the game there
We'll get into stores
On February 22nd
And there you go
We got one more tweet to us
From DarkSakura on Twitter
Tweets us saying
Why you so hot?
I don't know if she's listening
On the mobile thing
If you have an iPhone or whatever
You can just go to allgames.com
And it's like HTML5 now
You don't need an app anymore
There used to be an app, you don't need it anymore
You can listen to all games while you're on the road
So she might be doing that
So hi Jamie if you're listening
They're really close
She's at the IKEA, that's only 20 minutes away
So she's going to make it
Probably just in time for phone calls
But I think you're doing a fabulous job
So you would make DarkSakura very proud
I want to do this last story before
Well let's hurry up and get there
Because we're through Twitter topics
So we've got a couple more stories here
We'll go to Loki
Ah yes, so we were talking a little bit about
The 3DS and stuff
Of course not all of the news is great
They're going to be first off
Region locking the console
Which is not a huge surprise
Because the DSi, at least the DSiWare part
Was actually region locked
But now they've kind of gone against
What they've been doing with the NDS and stuff
And they're just locking the console
As I said before in our first story
You're just giving the hackers another excuse
To try to crack your system
Because now instead of like
Oh I want to install Linux on it
Now they're like, well I want to play games for other regions
So I'm going to hack this
And this is going to be my justification for doing that
So
I don't know, it sucks
It says
It looks like, for example
If you play a Korean 3DS game
With a Japanese 3DS system
Or vice versa
You won't be able to play it at all
Nintendo hasn't actually
Responded to the comment
About it
But they haven't really said it
It says there's no region codes in DS and DS Lite
But the DSi, DSi Excel
And 3DS have region codes
Region codes are installed in each game
And the 3DS itself
You can't play if the region
Codes are different
That's kind of lame
Boot of that
Region locking sucks
I hate it
It's what drove me to piracy
On the PS1
Was wanting to play import Japanese games
And I couldn't do it
Just being honest
And then of course they're talking about
Being a little bit more consistent
With their first party releases for the 3DS
They were saying that
With the Nintendo DS right now
They're not having
I don't know, I think they're doing pretty good
With the titles that they have coming out
They have about one or two titles
A month from
Actually Nintendo
Or maybe it's like one or two titles every few months
Because I know, let's see
Dragon Quest
Is being published by Nintendo
And then Pokemon Black and White
And then they've got
I guess they have a first party
Wii title for January
But they do have Mario Sports Mix
For February
But they're saying that they're going to be
Working to
Have a more consistent release schedule
For games
So maybe something like once a month
And
That's kind of cool
And they're also targeting other regions
As well
Developing countries additional to its current
Territories to bring the new handheld
The new console to
That's good for people
That haven't had a lot of
Console games, maybe Brazil
Or
South America and there's some places
Down there that could use
Some new consoles
I'm excited to hear
That they might have more of a
Constant stream of games
It seemed like with the DS it was like
Especially right after launch
I seem to remember a lot of games didn't come out
Almost for a year for the DS
Here's my thing though
Are we going to actually get
New games
Or is this going to be like
Oh yeah and we're porting this
We make some N64 and GameCube games
Over and over and over again
Look we got
Super Mario All Stars
There's third party developers though
And I'm sort of counting on them to not do that to us
If that makes sense
The Kingdom Hearts game looks interesting
And there's plenty others
Street Fighter 4 looks like it might be the biggest
Launch game of sorts
And I got to admit, how sad is this you guys
I don't even want to
Admit this
I kind of want the Nintendogs plus cats
And I don't know why
No I do know why, I want the cats
I'm not going to buy all three versions like Logie does, no way
No I'm not doing that either
I learned my lesson the hard way
You're not even going to buy one version this time
I'm not buying one
Well this will make a lot of people even more excited
With the 3DS, like I really wish they would do this
And I don't know why
Let me explain, here it is
Nintendo did an interview with Satoru Iwata
Called the Iwata Asks interview
Iwata-san also
Wants to include 3D video in the future
That's what Miyamoto had said
Iwata said quote
I think it would be fun if we were able to include
Video recording capabilities with future updates
That means it's not going to be there on release
But perhaps in the future
Why?
Why not? Let's do it
I mean I realize that 3D videos you can't watch them
A whole lot of places except maybe oh you're 3DS
But I don't know
I think that would be kind of cool
Like in a way being able to make your own 3D videos
Of course give it five seconds and there will be a porno
Give it five seconds
And there will be a porno on the 3DS
But can you imagine if you could do like video sharing
Through 3DS
Like if Nintendo was smart
They would
Introduce this whole like
Social network file sharing ability
Like a portal
Where you could share videos with your friends
That you make on the 3DS
Like my trip to Disneyland
They could have a 3D
YouTube
They could have it if they wanted it
Do you realize how big that is?
With 3D being all the rage and stuff right now
But they don't want it
Because they are so bullheaded
If Nintendo was smart
They would make 3D YouTube
Before YouTube can but they won't
Actually I think YouTube already has 3D U2
But the thing is
The difference is
Most computers yet aren't set up to do 3D
The 3DS
It's a camera and it's the viewer
All in one
Ugh
But no
They won't do it
Yes I'm mad
Because Nintendo just
They're hard headed
Nintendo's hard headed
By the way there was also talk about
The whole street pass feature
As used in Nintendogs plus cats
And that was from Hideki Kono
Quote, when you're using street pass and exchange data with someone
In walk mode
That person's me is walking whatever puppy he or she has chosen
Then your me's and puppy's talk
And exchange gifts
That's supposed to be like when people actually meet
In the park walking their dogs
And what have you
Although I've never given another dog walker a gift
But anyway that's supposed to be a feature
But I don't know I hear about this shit and I go
Isn't that what the DS was supposed to do?
Like wasn't your DS supposed to have that
Always aware thing like what's so special
About what the 3DS is doing
Do you have to hold the 3DS's in a certain way
So they can sniff each other's butts
Is that a feature?
Maybe I don't know
Here's what it is to answer your question
Remember before you had to
Have a certain game in there and it would
Be in that mode or whatever
If you had to have Nintendogs in your system
And they had to be in the sleep mode or whatever
They had to have Nintendogs
And it would detect them
This will pick up anything regardless of what game it is
So say for example I have Mario Kart and Nintendogs
And someone else has Mario Kart and Nintendogs
But they're playing like
Street Fighter 4 or something like that
It'll still tag my system
With all their other crap
There's some clarifications from our chat room
At chat.orangemanstrader.com
Tigerclaw is clarifying the 3D YouTube videos
Are the red and blue
If you have the red and blue glasses you can watch some 3D videos
On YouTube
Yes they have that but there's also the other ones
They do have multiple versions of 3D
I think there's people making
Self-made 3D stuff right now
But it's just, it's very limited
Azzam in our chat room says
Nintendo Smart? That's like PS3 unhackable
I see what you did there
Alright
SalaciousPop what do you have for us?
I'm not sure why you put
This particular story in the news feed
It's amazing
Because I used to work in
Adult entertainment and I'm sure if
Jamie got this story she would just be flustered
And annoyed
A company named D-Dub Software
Is putting out a
Porno, triple X rated
Indie game called Bonecraft
Based off of Blizzard's World of Warcraft lore
Where it's like inspired by
But obviously it's close enough
To where they can't I guess get sued
But yeah so D-Dub
Software who also put out
Games, I'm trying to find
Bonetown, Bonetown is another
Game of theirs and the Tiger Woods
Sex game I guess
Plot summary
Somewhere in the galaxy there's Orcs and Elves
This isn't a direct quote
I'm just paraphrasing it because otherwise it would be too long
Orcs and Elves running around
Space Marines crash land on the
Planet and I guess there's something about
Secret Elf
Brothels and I'm sure
You move your mouse up and down
To do the sex and I don't even know what this is
What is this I don't even
But yeah, Bonecraft the World of War
Or the Blizzard sort of
Starcraft Warcraft genre
Porno game
I love that it's combining Warcraft
And Starcraft together in its parody
Yeah so for those that
Want to
Google that when they're by themselves
The door closed, that's
And locked, lock it
You lock the door
D-Dub Software
And the game is a Bonecraft
So that's some lol's for you there
An actual video game and not just a porno
It kind of reminds me of
30 Rock
Season 3 when Tracy Jordan was
Gonna quit television to make the most
Amazing porn computer game of all time
I don't know if anyone watches 30 Rock
Maybe this is it
We should get the creators of this on the show
Like let's totally take them seriously
And just be like you know so tell us about
The plot of your game like how do you
Envision your hero
Come on you know you want it
Episode 400 interview with Bonecraft
Yes or no? What do you think?
I think we should
That's gonna be the drunk show
What would you ask the creators of Bonecraft
Logie? I don't know
I'd have to learn more about their
Title I guess
Well the title is Bonecraft
I understand that but what the hell's
The game I mean
Bone town is just some really crappy
Avatar game where people talk dirty to
Each other I mean that's
It doesn't tell me anything
Alright let's get to some
More stories and then the mailbag
And the FUs of the week are all coming right up
I mean seriously
What is Bonecraft?
What is it?
Um
Alright so you know
PSP2
Let's not talk about it because you know
No one's announced it yet but it might
Be announced very soon actually there is
A rumor that the PSP2 will be unveiled
This month in Tokyo at a Sony
Business meeting and it has been confirmed
That such a meeting is being held
In Tokyo on January 27
This was confirmed by
Sony themselves of course they say
They can't comment on anything at this time
Which probably means that yes
They are going to be announcing it at that time
Um
So that's cool so if they announce it this year
I'm assuming it will probably be coming out this year
It'll probably be at E3 so
Um I guess we'll have to wait and see
When that
PSP2 is coming out
That doesn't exist but does exist
Yeah
By the way it
Missed our show roll tonight
But E3 I guess is now open
Taking registrations and all that fun stuff
I know because we've been kind of looking into it trying to make our plan
For E3 this year which sadly we
Already know Loki's not going based on things he said
On the show before but uh
I am doing everything I can in my power to go
This year because you know I think I've said this before
On the show this year is going to be either
The best E3 ever or the worst
E3 ever I honestly
Think because it's going to be all about
You know where they're going to go
With these new fangled things
They've got on consoles
What's next? Where's your killer app?
I really don't think anyone's going to be announcing
A new console this year
I don't think the
Wii HD is happening at a Nintendo at this point
Because I think they're going to really throw everything
They've gotten to the 3DS this year
It's everything you're going to be seeing
Sony and Microsoft
Have no reason to give up what they're doing on their
Consoles right now so
Well I guess the PSP2
Would be the one console that you're probably going to see
More information about
That wasn't announced earlier
As we've heard it might actually come out with Tokyo Game
Developers Conference who knows
Could come out a lot sooner
It's going to be a very interesting year
I hopped on this generation of consoles pretty late
I didn't get a 360
Which is the first out of the two that I got
Until Christmas of 08
So a little over two years
The idea that the 360 is
Six years old or will be this summer
I know
I can't wrap my head around that
When the new consoles should be
They should be announcing a new Xbox this year
But it's not time
I don't think it's time
We've got at least one or two more years out of these things
Isn't it funny that when we were sitting here
Because the show has been on this long
That we have episodes dating back to when these
Consoles were debuting and we were sitting here going
They're saying that PS3 has a 10 year life cycle
Come on you're not
You're full of crap
I'm not ready to see new hardware yet
I'm not either
I'm going to be off if new hardware were out already
Because it would be all 3D and you need 3D
TVs for it and
Everything
I don't know
You already made me buy upgrades to the current consoles
With the Kinect and the Move
Although I didn't buy the Move
Give me reasons to really love these things
If there's a game to necessitate it
There wasn't a game that necessitated me buying it
I would even argue that maybe
I shouldn't have bought the Kinect
But I do really like Dance Central and some of the other stuff
But I really don't have a reason to get a move right now
So I don't know
There's a lot of people out there saying
Dark ToaGak in our chatroom says I still don't have a 360
Are people still calling it next gen consoles?
Because I think we're past that right?
I made that mistake for about two years after it was out
Next gen
Next gen
There is no next gen yet
We'll see
One person that wants to play a little more
In what's going on in the console world
It's GameStop
They want to link you with a GameStop ID
On their console
That's because GameStop is selling more of the digital stuff
In their stores
They had an interview with Ars Technica
Not that long ago
And the Senior Vice President of GameStop, Sean Freeman
Said that while the company is doing a good job
Of selling Microsoft Points cards
They're looking to cut some of the friction
Out of the experience
I'm not sure what that means
But what they say is that instead of buying a card
To go home and input the code
Ultimately they want you to tie your online account
With a GameStop ID
So ultimately we want to reduce
Even more of that friction
So when you buy that map pack in our store
We're going to be able to associate your Xbox profile
With your GameStop profile
And then automatically push it to your download queue
I still never understood
The reason why I would want to even do this
Honestly
I mean
If you're going to
Say for example
Buy download content from them
Just buy a fucking 1600 point card
Or something like that
Why are you going to give them your information for this stuff
Why do you even
Even if you're not interested in purchasing a ton of download content
And you have no games to trade in
Why the fuck would you ever
Leave your home
Go to a store
To buy something that you could just flip your console on
And download straight from the marketplace
And download straight to your console
And I tell you
By the time you drove to the store and back
It would already be downloaded
So I just don't understand
Why you would even like
Waste the time to go give them money
And you're paying tax
On top of that
I'm making stink face at this whole idea
To have a separate layer of
A GameStop ID
That's just yet another account that I have to sync
With my XBLA or whatever
If they want to be the middle man in that
Password that could possibly get exploited
Yeah this is a dumb
Idea and I don't get it
Well I think GameStop to some extent is doing what they feel
They have to do to survive
Because I think we've said this on the show before
That GameStop is going to go the way of Blockbuster Video
Real soon
If something doesn't happen
Here's the thing, they're not going anywhere
Because they're the biggest fish in the sea
So was Blockbuster at one time
No no no no
This is totally different because you see
The publisher or the movie studios
They don't need Blockbuster
Like they need GameStop
Because Blockbuster rents
Movies, they don't sell movies
And unfortunately they make more money
In the sell through business than they do in the rental business
If Blockbuster was a big powerhouse
In selling movies that would be a different
Different thing altogether
But GameStop, they're a big powerhouse
When it comes to sell through and unfortunately
They could dictate
To the publishers what the fuck do they want
Them to do
So they say, you know what, we still want you to put physical copies out
They're going to put physical copies out
They're just trying to get into the DLC
Stuff because they figure, hey, we can get some
More money from that because we can just
Pay Microsoft or whatever
Or a small little kickback for these things
But we get some money out of that transaction
And that's more money for us
Because we don't actually have to sell any physical goods
It's digital stuff now
So that's what that's all about
I mean if they really wanted to
I mean they have cards and stuff
That I guess they have made for them
But that's all it's about
It's not about them trying to survive
It's about them being fucking greedy
That's all it is
They don't need to be in this business at all
Why aren't they selling
Well I guess I should say
Why aren't they selling PC games digitally
But they are
But I mean they're in no way going to be able to
Compete well with Steam or something
It's just
We're looking at our comments from chatroom at chat.orangelandtrady.com
Brad from Pod Culture says
Used to work at Blockbuster back in the day
And yes Blockbuster does sell movies
New and used
I know that they do but they're not like at Walmart
Where Walmart sells hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
And hundreds and hundreds and thousands of movies
Versus Blockbuster's
Oh we're bringing in some extra for sell through
It's way different
Way different
They never looked at Blockbuster as a big old
Source of
Profit for stuff
Unfortunately things change
Way back in the day one
It was all about VHS tapes
And stuff like that
And they were charging the Blockbuster's
Or any video rental place
Up to $100 per tape
That's where they're making the money
But then with the advent of DVD
Unfortunately the cost of goods has come down
It's all about quantity
And so because of quantity
Their business has shifted to sell through
Where a $100 movie was
Way out of the realm of
Some consumer purchasing it for themselves
So that's why they had to rent it out
Before it became sell through pricing
Now everything is released at sell through
Pricing and so there's really
No incentive for somebody to
Well I mean there is an incentive for people to rent
Stuff because it's still cheaper but
It's less of an incentive now because they can just
Go to the store and buy their movie
New
Because before they wouldn't be able to do that
So that's why it's all shifted to
The sell through business and that's why
Blockbuster is
Well it's why Blockbuster is failing
That and they're losing out to
Kiosk vendors and stuff like that
Kind of a funny comment from our chatroom
At chat.orangelandtrader.com
Rama says no GameStop lost their touch when they got rid of the
Funkoland name
I remember when Funkoland advertised
In magazines and stuff and you could get their little
Flyer it was all like a mail order thing
It was the good old days
Alright we're going to get into the mail bag here at
Orangelandtrader.com slash mail bag
But just getting into the studio right now
Dark Sakura has arrived
Back from her event. Welcome back
You've been missed tonight. How are you doing?
I'm pinballed out
I played nothing but Rocky and Bullinkle and I
Played Theater of Magic before we actually got there
Alright and I apologize in advance
I have to do some audio adjusting
On the fly because Dark Sakura and Salacious Pop are not
The same. Salacious Pop was using
Dark Sakura's microphone so
Not the same. Yes you have boobies
Yes and they are magnificent
Well how was the pinball event? You want to tell us real quick
About it? I know it was a private thing so it wasn't
Like a public event but
It was pretty cool. He had a lot of good tables
And there was like 25 people over
There and Steve Ritchie was there
And he was really cool
I mentioned earlier in the show you were texting me this morning
That you were rubbing elbows with some famous
Pinball peeps. That's pretty cool
Did you give us an interview for the show?
No but his wife and I talked for a long time
And she's really sweet. Oh good
Yeah um
Yeah Dan's in there saying we probably could
He's really cool. I mean I've just
Sat and chatted with him before at
Convention so. Sure. What tables did he work on?
Um he did
No Fear and
Black Knight which are both ones that we have
And he did the voices in them. Oh right because you're
Very proud of your autograph on those right?
Dan just come in here and answer the damn questions
Dan just been driving for two hours
You was away. You were like in the Bay Area right?
Um actually somewhere
Near French Camp
Oh that's not down by Stockton. Okay
Yeah just past Stockton. Oh you're going the other way
But we rode with someone in Davis
So that's why
We gave the update from Davis
Sure sure gotcha
But I played a lot of Rocky and Bull Eagle
And there was a whirlwind
And uh
Safe Cracker I think was one of them
And uh they have
Really really pretty Twilight Zone
Like with the topper and everything
And uh
All kinds of good stuff
Rob would you like a chair?
And uh
Yeah sorry for the dead air
I'm getting hammered with chat and chairs
Switcheroo and all that at once. Live radio folks
He hit him with the metal chair!
Boom! No
Um but it was
It was pretty fun and then my
Hips started to hurt and I started to get grumpy
So I sat down and got on my
Laptop for a little bit and you know
I had a lot of beer
Good times. So you've been drinking a little bit
Three New Castles and a Guinness. That's not a lot
That's nothing for you. You should have seen me last night
I mentioned this earlier on the show. I was out with
Rice Princess and X-tifer and Grandpa
Warcraft from the other show and
Salacious Pop here. We were all out and I
Got drunk. Like I made a
Ass of myself in front of Rice Princess and X-tifer
I know I actually will. Oh sorry you were
Muted there Salacious Pop. I'm sorry
I was drunk that he agreed to go to Denny's
For the after bar food
I hate Denny's with a passion
Like I just burned out on Denny's in my
Early 20's right
That was the post club place to go
Well keep in mind for the rest of you guys that aren't in California
We don't really have diners here
Like diners are unheard of here. There is no such thing
As a waffle house. Which is a shame
No mom and pa diners. There's nothing like that
We have Denny's. Denny's, Denny's, Denny's, Denny's
Everywhere. Well we had Lion's and we had Epi's
None of them are 24 hours anymore
And they're gone
It's Denny's and last night when I was drunk
I wanted chicken strips
They sobered him right up
Greasy chicken strips. They're good. Hang over here
Well you remember my last super drunk time
That I was hanging out with you other than the time
At Tia's when they lit up in the apartment
And it made me throw up
Was the waffles
The waffle incident
It's carby stuff Rob
It's the greasy carby stuff
Well I guess I should pull up the chatroom
You'd be very proud of
We've gotten through most of your news tonight already
You'd be very proud of Salacious Pop. He did a fine job
He picked the classic game of the week tonight
What was it?
King's Quest IV
Of course the Rosella game
Which was one of the best in the series
Figured since you tended to give
Sega a lot of love
Because Sega deserves my love
Salacious Pop went to the PC market
We did determine today
On the ride back that Sega makes
Crappy pinball tables
Alright, let's get to the mailbag you guys
At mailbag
At orangeloungeradio.com
And sadly there is not a lot in the
Mailbag tonight
Where's my mailbag music?
Is there Viagra spam? Because you can just read that
Not this week
I'll go ahead and do it since Dark Soccer is still getting
Do you want to be uncomfortably hard?
Well also
A lot of it's my fault with the whole lack
Of podcast feed updating
But again a new show went up today
And will continue throughout the three day weekend
I have tomorrow off so I'm going to work on OLR stuff
Before I forget, 71
Is what?
Since we were keeping track of my levels
Oh god
I already told you last night
Alright, anyhow
Let's get into this email from
RobWithTwoB's
And this is actually somewhat of a serious email
Because obviously we had that tragedy that happened in Arizona
Which is just
Unfortunately some bonehead
Did something really really really
Really really bad
And now it's making a lot of people think
Differently and in response
Let me read the email here
From Rob
In response to Jared Lee Lauder gun attack
It appears the following article replaces video games
With political rhetoric
The article is good even though the study mentioned is weak
And he links us to the story from Boing Boing
The bottom line is that you have to be
A violent person to begin with
Let me kind of go to the story real quick
And try to pick out some of this stuff
Oh yeah
They just kind of go through
This study and they just replace
The words video games with violent rhetoric
And it's kind of like, gee haven't we seen this whole thing before?
IDK
But Rob
Says my point of view and I know I've said this before in a mail bag letter
Is that a person is solely responsible
For what influences him or her
Although from what I've read of the Arizona shooting
The shooter was extremely mentally ill
And without treatment
We may be looking at a situation where the parents
Did not know about paranoid schizophrenia
And therefore didn't get treatment for him
Don't worry though, video games are also being blamed
Of course, aren't they always?
From all with two B's
And it's just unfortunate, you know, in these times of tragedy
Everybody's, you know, kind of pointing the finger
At what there is to blame
And I don't know
All of it's to blame to an extent
But what's most to blame
Is this individual
An individual is responsible for their actions
And it's, I don't know
It's just, it's a
Not an easy situation with not an easy answer to it
But, you know, you have to look to how to
Prevent this type of stuff in the future
And we're all gonna pay for it
Because, you know, it's not gonna be, it's gonna
Make our Congress people less accessible
In the future
It's just unfortunate
And yeah, I kind of agree with Frisbee in our chat room
This guy is a psycho, end of line
Yeah, that's, that's kind of how I
Feel about it
There you go, that's it for the emails this week
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com
I'm expecting this thing to be full next week
Full with stories next week
Loki has another news story
For us, and then we're gonna get to the Skype line
Here in just a minute at Orangelaunchradio on
Skype or our phone number
1-877-GAME-OLR
Yes, last thing I have to talk
About, and this is not a surprise
I mean, I guess this is a surprise for a Wii game
Just Dance 2 has gone
Five times platinum, that's right
It sold five million copies
And that's not bad
For considering the fact it came out
At the end of October
That's way too much Kesha, for me
That's way too much
That's insane though, that it's done that well
I mean, yeah, to put this
In contrast, we just had a story earlier in the show
Where you were saying, hey, Dance Central's doing great
It sold one million copies
We just mentioned now
Just Dance has sold
Just Dance 2, excuse me, has sold five
Million copies
It's not like Just Dance franchise has sold five million copies
This one game has sold five million copies
That is crazy
It is so popular
I'm surprised
That Ubisoft hasn't brought
The Just Dance franchise
To other consoles now
They have the Move and the Kinect stuff
Well, the Michael Jackson game
Isn't that really just a Just Dance Michael Jackson game?
It's coming out on the other systems
I bet you though that we'll see Just Dance 3 come out on all the platforms
Oh, I'm sure
The Move would be
Stupid easy to port
Because it's very similar
Kinect, a little different
And it's going to be hard to separate it now
Like Dance Central kind of beat them to the punch a little bit on Kinect
But if Dance Central
And Dance Masters can kind of coexist
And Dance Paradise
Oh yeah, that one
That's not out here, is it?
Okay, then I guess there'll be room for this too
But you know what?
Then I think I've had enough dancing games
They need to kill each other off in a battle royale
And one will be left standing
Which will probably be Dance Central
Get some Highlander up in this
For real, I want to see the head chopped off of Dance Masters
There can be only one
And make it be really good and I will buy that one
Evacuate the dance floor
Alright, forget it
Moving on to one more song here
One more story here
Maybe it'll have a song and dance with it
Cooking Mama has arrived on Facebook
That's right
Mama will fix Facebook now
The Cooking Mama franchise has arrived on Facebook this week
Friends Cafe
Is the name of the game
So we're going to dub it then Clicky Mama, right?
Yes, Clicky Mama
That's right, Clicky Mama
Don't worry, Mama will click it
You can visit the game at facebook.com slash
Cooking Mama Cafe
It has some of the same food preparation
Gameplay, of course
That you're used to seeing in the series
There's also unlockable upgrades
For your personal kitchen
Of course, you can buy them as well
Cause it's a Facebook game
And if you neglect your cafe, you will see it shut down
Aww
So there you go
If you want to see what's going on in the Cooking Mama world
You can now explore that on Facebook
I wonder how many people will abandon Knights of the Crystals
To go play Friends Cafe
I don't know
Oh god
83, I'm level 83 in that game
And I think Slice is Pop is actually higher than me
Yeah, I've run out of stuff to do, really
In Knights of the Clicky
Knights of the Clicky is not even a good game
I've already given up on it
Why do I keep playing it?
Rob wants help!
Yay, thank you, I appreciate it
They have released new stages
Like I just unlocked the Merman
From doing the underwater stages
So that's about all they do
But for every new map that they open up
They also release one that only requires pay items
Of course
That's how it works
You know what? It's all going to shit when the Civilization game comes out
That's how I feel
I want that damn Civilization game now
That's when you'll dust off your credit card for a Facebook title
For real
Alright, we're going to open up the Skypline
It is open right now
We're going to do the Effies of the Week
We didn't do the Effies of the Week yet
I'm bad
I did a bad thing and we didn't get the angst out
Oh Rob, you're so bad
I was just distracted by you getting back to the studio
My DJ's so bad?
Uh, F you to my hip
Fucker
Done
Slaces pop
Um, F you I guess
To me not really knowing how awesome Panera Bread is
Up until just recently
It's a pretty good month so far
No angst
Um
F you to the fact that I have a very tough decision coming up
And I think I know what I'm going to do
And it's not going to make some people very happy with me
But in the end I know that it's the thing I've got to do
It has nothing to do with me
It has nothing to do with this program or anything you guys know about me
So it's just
I'm being cryptical on purpose
But I don't like these tough decisions
I think I know what it is
Oh you do, I know you do
But sorry listeners, it's private
Loki
Uh, F you to my JTAC constantly being broken
And it was really broken
I actually sent it away to be re-balled
Which is where they pull the chips off
And they put new solder balls on them
They actually have lead in them
How they should have been
And that didn't even fix it
So uh
It's broke
Alright
That's going to do it for the FUs of the week
Let's go to the Skype line but we're going to start the Skype line tonight
With something a little special
We're actually going to place a call right now
And uh
Get him on the line here
So we can get an update on what's going on
With one of our partner shows
Hi Breslil are you there?
What? Huh? Breslil how you doing?
Hi Hi
Hi Hi
Guy? Hi
What? What? Oh shit
Alright Breslil is helping out with a big old
To do thing at Under Sedation Live
They're our pals and buddies and I say that mostly
Because that's the show I started on
And they are live of course Saturday nights here
At All Games Radio and uh
We like to help out with a little thing called
USLOLR Madness
Yeah and it's
I have learned something I am not expanding it
To 96 games next year
There's a lot of shit that gets in there honestly
I voted on the
Current brackets and there's some weird shit in there
Yeah it's because people
People like SSJ-100
Matt say hey Blade's a steal number one
And then it gets a 12 seed
So anyways
Voting for the Breslil region
Actually closes in about half an hour
For the first region it will close
And then I'll announce the
Next line of games when we get into the real meat
And potatoes basically Chrono Trigger comes
To play that's all that happens
But I have some scores here of some games
I thought you all would be interested in
Alrighty
So I'll start with the OLR region because it's your
Region
Secret of Mana
Is beating Katamari
Namashe right now
It's pretty close. Quake is losing
To Half Life
I'm okay with both of those
Sometimes and the weird thing about
USL Madness is that sometimes the pairings
Are really hard early on
And you know that's true of any tournament
Comp style competition but sometimes the pairings
This early on like Quake vs
Half Life those are both games that deserve
To move on but just the way the brackets are set up
It's not gonna happen you know
And um
What else was I gonna say about that you know
It's like Mega Man 2 vs Mega Man 3 last year
That was just probably one of the toughest decisions
I had to make
At that point you know there really only
Needed to be one Mega Man game that represents
Them all you know
Yeah but moving on the last one
And this is a Bemani one so I had to throw it in there
Para Para Paradise is
Narrowly losing to Sinistar right now
That is such a weird
Match up
Yeah I don't know how that works
You know what though as much as I love my
Dancy games I don't think Para Para
Is the dancy game I would choose to represent
Sorry Misty I know you're gonna hate me for that
But Sinistar did bring us the whole
Beware I live
Which is pretty awesome
Moving on to the Harper region
Wow is barely beating Bionic Commando
It's by like a vote
Wow
Yeah exactly
Pong is beating System Shock
And probably the most bizarre first round
Match up and it's beating it pretty soundly
Here's a head scratcher
Kingdom Hearts is beating
Markham Asylum
Interesting
Well I
Knowing the listeners of this show
That mostly prefer the import
Stuff I mean if I were to say you know the majority
Of the listeners not all of them but I know the majority
Of our folks are kind of into the
Squeenix import stuff that doesn't
Surprise me
I can't speak for USL but I know we have
A lot of the same listeners so it wouldn't surprise me
I got sick of Kingdom Hearts
Pretty quickly but that's just me
Over to the Donovan region and the other
Bmoni game in this region
If you're wondering where the hell DDR is
DDR got a 3 seed so it gets a buy
In the first round it doesn't get to play
But Popin' Music
Is playing Perfect Dark and
It's not looking good for Popin' Music
As it
As it doesn't need to be
Looking good for it
And speaking of Blades of Steel it's losing
To Dragon Quest 9 right now pretty badly
Ouch
This is one of the Brestler region I'm also not saying
All of these games because it would be 32
Matchups we'd be here forever and Rob, Jamie
And Loki have things to do tonight
Where can you kind of like
Follow the action on what's going on
At USL Madness
I haven't been posting the
Results but
Time and again I will every day post
Like oh hey this matchup's close
Or this region needs votes like the OLR
Region really needs votes right now so
And then I'm gonna
Finally go to the Brestler region here
Final Fantasy 10
Is just barely beating
Crazy Taxi
Borderlands
Is beating the ever loving snot out of the
Call of Duty series
Good
Yeah that one was like
That could go either way but I wouldn't be
Upset if Borderlands went and then here's
Probably the most interesting one, Techno Super
Bowl is losing to Halo Reach
By about 10%
No that's not
That is not even the Halo game that should be
Representing the Halo franchise I'm sorry
Halo 2 all the way
If it was Halo 2 beating it then I'd be a little more
Sympathetic but Halo Reach no
No
But those are just some of the matchups
If you want to vote I will post the link
Again in chat if you're listening live
The Brestler region closes in
20 minutes
So you better vote now bitches
Yeah Donovan regional closed
Monday night, Harper regional closed Wednesday
Night and since it was late on OLR
OLR region will close Friday night
Alright and you'll be posting all the updates
In our forums at orangeandlongestrader.com correct?
Yes and probably here before
You guys sign off I will have the results of the Brestler
Region so you see what games go on and what
Faces what so Alright sounds good
Thank you for putting this all together it sounds
It's a little fun nerd stuff but fun
Yeah
I gotta ask before I go who do you
Got this year who do you think is gonna win? Who do I think
Is gonna win this year? Duh Super Metroid
It needs to reclaim the throne of course
I wouldn't
Be upset if Final Fantasy 6 won
For a game
Because Final Fantasy 6 has never won before
Right? No it got to the finals for the
First time last year I would be okay with that
What other games have gotten really close but haven't won
Yet
Link to the past
Ocarina of Time
Super Mario Brothers
And Mega Man 2 all have gotten really close
I would be okay with any of those
Winning the whole thing except for
Ocarina of Time
I'm gonna start
Ocarina of Time is just like Chrono Trigger
To me I don't understand everybody's hard on
For it I don't
Link to the past forever
Yeah but anyways guys
That's it I will
I will talk to you guys probably next week here
And y'all have a good night Alright YouTube
Have a good one and good luck with the
And keep Donovan
And Jessica Harper in check for us
I'll try
Alright later
Later
Alright if you want to give us a call the skype line is now open
For everyone yay
187 game OLR
Or our user name on skype is Orange Launch Radio
Let's go right to the phones cause they've been ringing while we were on that last call
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
Hello you're
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
Hey what's up guys
This is Kaijuto Hey Kaijuto there you are
What's up buddy
Not much I just called to recommend
The game to you guys Please do what game?
It's a PC game
It's first person shooter I heard you all
Talking about you were fans of
The original GoldenEye for the N64
The original GoldenEye was pretty badass I liked it
Alright well then
You need to pick up this mod you need
You need Steam of course you need
Either Half Life 2
I'm not gonna get into all of the games but you know what I'm saying
When I say you need a Valve game you need Half Life 2
Or Portal
Or Team Fortress you know one of those
Actually is it Team Fortress I'm not sure
Just get Half Life 2 Deathmatch which is just $4.99
You get that and then you can
Download this GoldenEye source mod
Which is the best freaking game
Period that I've ever played
I think you all need to check it out
Interesting you're a big Half Life fan
I am hugely into Half Life 2
And the source
Half Life 2 engine I've played a ton of
Mods and add-ons
Expansions that are fan made for Half Life 2
And I know exactly what he's talking about
I haven't checked it out
But yeah I will now
I've heard of this it looks pretty awesome
Yeah they just went out of beta
Maybe people have played it before
You know I guess it was version 2
Version 3 and maybe they didn't like it
But this new update
The release version
Oh my god it'll blow you away
The maps are just incredible
The first person shooter maps you'll ever play
And the first person shooter to date
And I mean that
I'll ban myself from all games
If you guys don't like that game
That's how dedicated I am
You don't have to do that
Everybody has different opinions
I'll check it out especially if it's kind of cheap
I think I already have Half Life 2
I can't remember if I have it on PC
I think I've been playing it on Xbox
But I have Portal and Team Fortress
Portal should be enough
Any game that uses the Source SDK
In the Half Life 2 family
Will let you run this add-on
So Portal should do it
I guess I'll have to check that out
And we'll see if this guy gets banned
From all games forever
Me mishearing you for a second
I mean it though
You really need to check that game out
I think these guys need to be supported
I think they spent about 5 years making this mod
And it really shows
I mean the maps
They had the original maps from the N64 game
And then they built their own maps
And you're just like
How the heck can they do all this
It's just really great
Well I'm all for supporting the community
But Dark Soccer, what did you want to say?
I misheard you when you said Team Fortress
And for a moment it sounded like you said Team Fortress
So now I'm thinking about
A big deathmatch game with a bunch of angsty teenagers
Wouldn't that just be Battle Royale?
Team Titans
You're giving me a mod idea now
Seriously there should be a Battle Royale mod
Like you have the jock
And then you have the emo kid
And you have the goth
Well you know the emo kid would just be busy cutting himself
His hair of course
Breakfast club frag edition
Yeah
I mean you've got your different classes
Your clicks
And they're a different class
The cheerleader
Is athletic and can kick people in the face
And has the booby attack
Nice
And then there's the football player
Who's like really big and stupid
Well Kaijuto
I'm definitely going to have to check out this GoldenEye mod
Because I did enjoy the GoldenEye on the 64
I even really enjoyed what I played
The Wii version at E3
I didn't want to plunk down 50 bucks for it
But maybe when it goes to the bargain bin
I'll probably check it out a little more
Just because my Wii is not really my gaming console
Of choice right now
It's still in a box from when I moved a year ago
Sad
I played the Wii version first
And then when I got it on GoldenEye source
It totally dwarfed the Wii's version
The online part of it
I mean they don't have a story version
And I do like the Wii's story version of GoldenEye
But multiplayer
There's nothing like it
You really need to check it out
When I last heard of this GoldenEye mod
Specifically it was still in alpha
This was months and months ago which is why I never checked it out
But the one Half-Life 2 mod
I really need to come out this year
Is Black Mesa
The Half-Life 1 remake
That's been vaporware for six years
Now that this GoldenEye
Is actually in beta and going to have a release
Version soon
This needs to light the fire
Under the butt of those that are working on Black Mesa source
I need it to happen
Well unfortunately we lost the caller there
I don't know if he accidentally hung up on us
Or if there was a connection issue
I swear I didn't click a button to hang up on him
And we will definitely check out that game
In the future
So our Skype line is back open again
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype
1877 Game OLR is our phone number
You can give us a call
I'll just throw over to Loki real quick
If you have any last minute stories you want to throw out there
I don't know
Just real quick, Arcade Infinity is not closing after all
That's right
There's a story about that on our very own website
And yeah they still had a big party this weekend
Just to kind of celebrate
So that's good
Well congratulations to Arcade Infinity
Hopefully it's not like
Only open for three more months and then
Psych we closed again
Well it was some weird thing where like it was actually the city
That didn't want them to stay open
Yeah I heard about that
Something about their business license being really expensive
Well let's go to the phones because we got another call on the line
Hi caller you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
This is Brad from Pod Culture
Hey Brad I haven't heard from you in a long time
How are you doing buddy?
I'm going bald
Sounds like me
Well what's new in your world?
DC Universe Online
Ah of course there's a lot of nerds
Very happy that this is out this week
What do you think?
I'm loving it
It's still got its issues
Like any of those kind of games at launch
But I am really digging it
Because I am a huge kind of nerd
PS3 or PC?
PS3
Actually the way the controls
Feel
It actually feels like it's made for
A console
You're actually right in that regard
I think because even when I was playing it on the PC
I plugged in the Xbox 360 controller
Which is a little weird because the game wasn't made for that
But it works
And what's really interesting too is that when you do
Plug in the joystick all the little button
Symbols change to the Playstation
X's and O's
Which is weird if you're using a 360 controller
You've been gaming long enough
You know where those buttons are by
Feel
So cool, are you playing a hero or a villain?
Right now playing a hero
And how's that going?
What level are you?
I am about back up to where I was with the beta
I think I'm level 12 or 13
Nice
It was a little bit of an ordeal to get my game
Oh no
Amazon screwed up a shipment
Do you notice there's a lot of people
In that right now?
I'm getting knocked off
Every once in a while
Having some connection issues
So I don't know if it's my end here
Or just that everybody
Happens to be on the crisis server
Or not
How much patching
Did you have to do that first day?
Oh the first day I had about an 11 gig
Download
Oh my gosh, 11 gigs?
It seemed like it, it took a long time
That is
Crazy, wow
Well how is it playing an MMO on the PS3?
Do you think MMOs can work on the PS3?
Now that this, you know, big
Cause I think this is kind of the first one
There was APB I guess, but this is really
One of the first big ones I guess that's out
If they can make it
This kind of a controls game
It could probably work
It's pretty nice
Are you able to talk to
Other people okay?
You do not need to do that in your experiences
With DC Universe online
Do you use a keyboard or?
You can, I went out and got the
Keypad for the
PS3 controller
But
Apparently you can do some chat
But it's a little weird to get it set up and working right
You can just use your Bluetooth
Headset
Do you find that the text, you can actually read it
Cause one of the complaints I've heard about the PS3
Version is that the text is very small on
It is a little small but I've got a
Fairly good size
TV so
It's alright, it's a little small maybe
If you've got a little bit of vision
Issues you might have a problem
But I'm not seeing too much of a
Problem with it
What kind of audience would you recommend
This game to? Do you think everybody should be checking
It out or is this only for the hardcore right now
Or what?
I mean if you like
City of Heroes
That kind of stuff, it's definitely worth checking out
Alright
I think I might have to check this out but
Gosh, games are so expensive these days
And I already have one MMO I'm subscribed to
I don't need $30 a month
To play MMOs, boy oh boy
Yeah but you can get a good one now
Nice, I see what you did there
Alright well Brad, we gotta let you go
But do you have any other thoughts for us?
Nope, nope, just keep on doing what you're doing
And we'll keep listening
Alright thank you so much and check out Brad's show
It's available at podculture.net
Podculture.net and
Soon to be podculture.com
Cause we are switching over to a new host
We're gonna be an indie show again
Nice, alright well welcome to the indie
Realm I suppose and
You can of course always look him up on iTunes
Which is kind of the king of podcasts there
Alright, take care everybody
Later guys
It's good to hear from Brad, it's been a very long time
We've heard from Brad, so glad to hear
He's back into gaming with whatever
We can probably do at least
One more call here, 1-877-GAMELR
Our username on Skype is
OrangeLoungeRadio
We'll get to at least one more call here before we wrap it up
Any other last minute stories?
Uh, I'm sure
I do have some
Let's see here
Of course I don't have them pulled up
Oh that's alright
You're saved by the Skype line, but get those up
While we take this last call
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
Oh you seem to always know how to get through
What's on your mind buddy?
Not too much, um
In reference to Funko Land, you got me
Thinking way back
As a little kid
In elementary school
Reading the magazines, hearing about the
Fun Club, going out
Getting boxes, packing up
My Nintendo games, calling
Them, getting the prices
Packing it up, sending it to them
Waiting about a week and a half
Getting some brand new
Nintendo games and playing them for hours upon hours
Oh yeah, that's how
I got my copy of Ultima 3 Exodus
On the NES was through Funko Land
It's not like I remember
Playing Renegade a long time ago
Then I remembered that game sometime later
And I started getting my hands on that
And I believed Dragon Warrior 3
Uh huh
That was my thing
It got to the point where I couldn't
Get all the games I wanted
I figured I had all these stacks of games
Might as well do something with it
And then I find out there's a Funko Land
And then during my
Junior high and high school years
That was my hangout spot
I would go there all the time
I met a lot of friends and stuff like that
And then eventually I stopped
Going because half the managers got sent
To different stores and the newer managers
Are assholes, so I was like
There was no point in going
And then one day I just happened to roll in there
And I go to the front counter
And I'm like, can I get a price sheet?
And they're like, we don't do price sheets anymore
And you have to go to the back of the line
And I turn around
I see this long line of people
And I said, to hell with this, and I walked out
Ha ha ha ha
So is there a GameStop
Where that Funko Land used to sit?
Yeah
Yeah, it really is
And
Where I used to live, one of my best friends
From high school, he finally told me
Like, maybe about six months or so ago
They finally turned the
Software, etc. in our old shopping center
Into Funko Land
Ha ha ha
Wow
Yeah, I didn't think it would take like 15 years
For them to change the logo on the front
Uh
Yeah, you know, there's a store in
Where was it that we were at?
It was in Oregon, and we were in what
Was it Ashland? No, Medford
Is the city right north of Ashland
When we went inside, it was a GameStop
It was just a GameStop
They had the white neon software, etc.
And it was like 1993 again
I know, and I had to buy a game there
Because I'm like, dude, it's a software center, I gotta buy a game here
But even the receipt on it said GameStop
It was sad
Well, slowly everything becomes a part of the machine
What do you think about the GameStop ID, though?
Let me ask you that real quick
Since you brought up that whole thing
Because I'm anti-GameStop in the first place
You're anti the man
Stick it to the man
Yes, I'll say it once, I'll say it again
Fuck GameStop
Alright, well on that note, we're gonna let you go, buddy
Cool
But have a good one
Reminiscing about the good old days with
DJ Rama S
Any other last minute stories?
Loki?
Um, yeah, a couple things
This is actually kind of funny
2, you know, the new one that's coming out on PSP
They're actually selling it in a 2-pack
In, um,
Japan
It's a double enlistment pack
It contains two UMD copies of the game
In their full packaging
Bundled together for
6,279 yen
Versus
Buying two 5,040 yen copies
So you're saving almost
Almost the price of one whole copy
Nice, I like these whole
Buy multiples, get one free
Alright, I lied, we're gonna take one more call
Because it's still ringing
So I guess I don't know why everybody wants to call tonight
Some nights we're sitting here begging for calls
But some nights, we got a busy line
So, hi, you're on Orange on Australia, who's this?
This is the head of the anti-Bimani
In the USL Madness tournament
Hi, Bobby, how are you?
I'm doing good
You guys have a good show tonight
Yeah, I'm having a good time
I hope you've had a good time listening
You always have us on at the end of your show
So I'm always happy when you're able to get in
Amongst the Skype Madness and be on the end of our show
That's right
I want everybody to vote against Poppin
And Para Para
And DDR, which got a buy
How did that even get in there?
Because too many people put it up towards the top of their list
You have to remember, our station started as a museum
So a lot of the people
We have a lot of players, the thick and thin
And some of the tough decisions we've made
But we do have a lot of fans of that
And, obviously, USL has their listenership as well
But I know a lot of it is crossover
This show, in some ways, was a spinoff of USL
So we have many listeners from back in that day
And I'm gonna say
I'm like you, I wouldn't be mad
If Final Fantasy VI won
As long as Super Metroid doesn't win
Oh, hater, why you hating?
Why you hating on Super Metroid?
Because it sucks
It does not suck
It's the most amazing video game ever made
Why are you hating on Super Metroid?
Because Super Metroid mimics a vacuum
Is it sad that I actually had to stop and think about that one for it?
I'm like, you don't play in a vacuum
What are you talking about?
Oh, you Bobby
Curse you, Bobby
Bobby, you just launched a new website for your show, right?
I did, bobbyblackwolf.com
And the podcast is back
The podcast feed is more up to date than ours
But that will all change this week
Here's the thing, my episode from tonight
Already on the podcast feed
Wow, amazing
That hasn't happened in three years
Good gosh
You need to cancel doing second shows more often
Exactly
And I reviewed the Telltale game Back to the Future
On my show
So people can go check that out
I guess we have to go check it out to see what you really think
But I was gonna say
Earlier, I'm really looking forward to the Jurassic Park game
I don't know why, but
I think it's because I like the books when I was younger
And I remember seeing the original movies
Except three, who bothered with three
But I'm kind of excited
To revisit those
Because it's been a long time since those movies were out
And that whole
Stuff was big
They never did make a fourth movie
I don't know if they were ever going to
But it would be kind of fun to revisit that world, I think
Yeah, and one of the things is when Heavy Rain came out
I even said
I would love to play a Telltale game like
Sam & Max using the Heavy Rain style of
Controls
And now that's what they're going to be doing for
Jurassic Park
Doing more Heavy Rain type stuff
Than just point and click adventures
And hopefully if it works for Jurassic Park
They'll do that in Sam & Max
And probably add some of that
Will there be a Jason scene in Jurassic Park?
Jason!
And I want to see a T-Rex holding a red balloon
And it's going
And it's going
And it's going
Jason!
Can't wait
Alright Bobby, anything else on your mind tonight
Before we wrap up our little show here?
No, I mean
Breslow wants to kick me, but once again
Vote against DDR
He'll deal with it
Every gamer has a voice
Even when they're wrong, like you are
All I gotta say is the next
Was it Poker Night
At the inventory or whatever?
It's going to be awesome
Was it Christopher Lloyd
And a T-Rex
And a Velociraptor
I'm the whole Jason
Alright
Bobby, thanks so much for your call
Take care
Thank you
Bobby Blackwolf, the man who does the show before us
You go all in on the next Poker Night
At the inventory at the Velociraptor
He's so pissed, he just eats strong bad
Violently, gruesomely
That's great
Alright, any other last minute stories
Before we wrap up the show tonight
Minecraft has sold a million copies
Which is pretty awesome
They have a new update for that
As well that adds
I still haven't played it, am I a bad gamer?
I haven't really played it either
I'm a bad gamer
Let's see
They added
Some new recipes including
Squids and cake
Yes
So you can get cake in the game
And I guess squids are a new enemy of course
So that's pretty cool
And yeah I guess from the squids
You can harvest black ink
For a new dye mechanic
Let's see what else
Remedy is bringing Death Rally
For the iPhone
Death Rally you may remember
As an old
Apogee game
Back from 1996
Kind of a top down
Combat racing game
Which is kind of cool
And then speaking of
IOS, the iPad has
A bunch of ridiculous peripherals
That were being shown off at
CES and of course
One of these is the
iCade which transforms to your
iPod or your iPad I guess
Into an arcade and you can get that ThinkGeek
For $100 or if you don't want to
Spend $100 but you still want
Some sort of tactile controller
They have a stick on
Joystick actually
For $25 and it just
Sticks onto your
iPad
Maybe Apple should release one
I think they should
Honestly I think they should have something
The iPhone or whatever plugs into
Apple if they want to just do Bluetooth
Support for controllers or something
That would be awesome
It's what the people want
Now that Verizon has their iPhone they're just going to sell even more
Of them and it's just like if they were to release
Just a little controller that plugs into
The bottom of those phones I tell you it's over
Yeah
So
Is that it? That's it
Alright well that's going to do it for another episode

I've never had better yogurt in my life
