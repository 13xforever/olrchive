[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna get to that in a minute because everything, like, changed.

9
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:07,707
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's like a new, is it technically a new decade now that it's 2011?

10
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:08,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

11
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:09,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

12
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:11,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, new decade, everything changed.

13
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, I'm gonna get to that in a minute.

14
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:14,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing's changed.

15
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:17,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought this- Techmaster Loki over there interjecting his opinion.

16
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:18,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

17
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Techmaster Loki?

18
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:21,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I brought soup a few weeks ago.

19
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:24,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, I had two large soups and I'm like, look, I have two soups.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,040
[SPEAKER_03]: But tonight you brought four.

21
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I have four soups.

22
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:27,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it wasn't intentional.

23
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I only wanted to.

24
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:30,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of two large soups, he has four smaller soups.

25
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:33,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think is still more soup than it was before.

26
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:35,750
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's value.

27
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:47,481

[SPEAKER_04]: You haven't been here in a few months.

33
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:08,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to remember the last time you were here, Loki was out.

34
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:11,846
[SPEAKER_04]: So you were kind of a fill-in host-y type deal.

35
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:12,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, something like that.

36
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,750
[SPEAKER_04]: You're back tonight to kick off the New Year with us here at OLR.

[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Sakura loaded her car and went up to Washington.

39
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:24,497
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your Washington trip, by the way?

40
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:26,359
[SPEAKER_04]: That fun, huh?

41
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:28,539
[SPEAKER_09]: It was alright.

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched a lot of the DIY Network and Chiller because they had a Buffy marathon.

43
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:38,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't Chiller also run the Twin Peaks episodes?

44
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:40,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea because I don't have cable.

45
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,252
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you watch on DIY?

46
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,172
[SPEAKER_09]: House Movers, that was pretty cool.

47
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:49,194
[SPEAKER_09]: And I watched a lot of the home repair ones.

48
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:52,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned the quick way to add in drywall.

49
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:55,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Here comes Dan the Man, the husband of DarkSakura, always present here.

50
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:56,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I on here?

51
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:56,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you're on.

52
00:02:57,096 --> 00:03:01,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Before you listen to her bitch about it, she also got to drink ridiculously expensive wine.

53
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:01,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I did.

54
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:05,798
[SPEAKER_10]: And she got completely smashed with my dad, which was hilarious.

55
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:09,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Your dad kept pouring me the wine.

56
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:10,862
[SPEAKER_10]: And you kept drinking it.

57
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:11,983
[SPEAKER_09]: And so did he.

58
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:13,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

59
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:15,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he got an inversion table, so I'm drunk and upside down.

60
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:18,985
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kinkier than it sounds.

61
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:20,506
[SPEAKER_10]: With my dad.

62
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:21,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up!

63
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:22,787
[SPEAKER_10]: You are a bastard.

64
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:23,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Indeed.

65
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:25,468
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a smooth pimp.

66
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:29,269
[SPEAKER_10]: So before you let her go, oh, it sucked and I was bored.

67
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:31,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't say it sucked.

68
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:31,990
[SPEAKER_10]: She had a good time.

69
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:33,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to sleep the whole way there.

70
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw her vlogs.

71
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:35,749
[SPEAKER_04]: They were entertaining.

72
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,730
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is a vlogger now with her little phonesy.

73
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,551
[SPEAKER_10]: And disturbing.

74
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Vlogging in the snow.

75
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:43,013
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Dan's sitting there in the background like, hey, I'm Dan.

76
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:44,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm driving.

77
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:46,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked more on a couple that we didn't upload.

78
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:47,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, bugger.

79
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well, I'm out of here.

80
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:49,717
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, take care, Dan.

81
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:53,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we do occasionally talk about video games here on Orange Lawn Radio.

82
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:54,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Video games, what the fuck?

83
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:58,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Since it is a new year, let me just kind of reset the stage for everybody if we happen to have any new listeners.

84
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:00,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're hitting the reset button real quick.

85
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:00,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Beep!

86
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:03,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it or not, Dance Dance Revolution, we used to be obsessed with that game

87
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, Rob, Rob.

88
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,279
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, it was Parapara.

89
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:37,885
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of that, too, and Beatmania, and a lot of those music-based video games.

90
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:46,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So for a very long time, before there was even podcasting, we had a show on Live365 dedicated to music games and the music from them and so forth.

91
00:04:47,338 --> 00:04:47,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Meek!

153
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:04,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan was in here doing the happy dance while I blithely flipped him off.

154
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:06,239
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny.

155
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:09,612
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

156
00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:30,814
[SPEAKER_09]: And, like, even some of the missions are now, like, broken.

157
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:35,317
[SPEAKER_09]: And as much fun as I was having, it's like, I'm kinda done.

158
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:36,778
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, what more can I do?

159
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:43,162
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, I thought that the changes were really exciting, but really all I ever do is go in there, talk to my friends, and play Dabo.

160
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:44,543
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

161
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:51,868
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I was like, you know, the door of opportunity swung open, so I gave it a try.

162
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:56,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Even after I was damn determined to play this game, because it did not want me to.

163
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:02,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I defied every power that tried to prevent me from playing this game.

164
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:03,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Meaning?

165
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:11,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Meaning that my stupid theloader.exe was reading badly with Windows, so I had to rename it Bob, and then it worked.

166
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,013
[SPEAKER_09]: No seriously, I tried every freaking thing.

167
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:18,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I ran safe mode with networking.

168
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I did all of this crap.

169
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,502
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally I'm like, fuck you, I'm naming you Bob.

170
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:23,242
[SPEAKER_09]: And it worked.

171
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:26,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there a program back in the day called Microsoft Bob?

172
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:27,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea.

173
00:09:27,348 --> 00:09:30,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that like the reason we have Comic Sans in the world now?

174
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:31,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

175
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:33,874
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I've got to go to our chat room.

176
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:35,554
[SPEAKER_04]: You know they are the always present guests here on the show.

177
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:36,795
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not allowed to talk.

178
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:38,355
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf, addict.

179
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:40,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, sellout.

180
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:41,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Bochikawa, addict.

181
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:45,857
[SPEAKER_04]: SalaciousPop in our chat room.

182
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:52,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I was fine with my spouse's sleeping pill and QVC addiction, but I will not abide World of Warcraft in this marriage.

183
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he trying to say that you're addicted to sleeping pills and QVC?

184
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:08,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan admitted to me earlier today that he used to stay up late in his high school years watching the Home Shopping Network.

185
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:20,620
[SPEAKER_10]: What other good shit about... I was in fifth grade, and I stayed up all night watching Home Shopping Network because I was up late, and it made me feel like somebody was up with me so I wouldn't be lonely.

186
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Pathetic, huh?

187
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:23,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Sad.

188
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:25,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hilarious because they're so stupid.

189
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:27,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I love watching them sell a computer.

190
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:31,598
[SPEAKER_09]: You press this button and it does stuff.

191
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:32,919
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes with a free printer.

192
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't know your show was going to be a confessional tonight, did you?

193
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:39,622
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we're cleaning the slate for New Year's.

194
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:42,844
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a confessional tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

195
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:47,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Get everything off your chest so that this new decade can be a relieving one.

196
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:49,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen to that.

197
00:10:50,385 --> 00:11:11,180
[SPEAKER_09]: But, well, I am going to say that I have now made it from one side of the continent to the other On whatever freaking continent that is that you took me to Actually, first of all, you took me to this giant tree And then I jumped off, died, and then respawned at the bottom of the tree So that I wouldn't have to figure out how to get off of it And then just ran across the water

198
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:13,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Star Trek Online

199
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:35,657
[SPEAKER_09]: As I was going through all of the ranks and stuff, you get more of the story, and I was like, well, it's really fitting in well with Star Trek Universe.

200
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:40,322
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I just got to this point, like, why are we fighting the Davidians?

201
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:45,947
[SPEAKER_09]: They were the lamest, brain-sucking, interdimensional creatures ever.

202
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Except that they gave me the cool Silent Hill thing, so that was cool, but...

203
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I accidentally ran into an instance and got killed.

204
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,775
[SPEAKER_09]: That has to happen at least once, I think.

205
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:01,217
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the one that was underwater, like with all the underwater people.

206
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:03,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like Black Fathom Depths.

207
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:04,098
[SPEAKER_09]: That was it.

208
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:04,839
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

209
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's sad I know that.

210
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I'm in some place called the Battle Scar, and I couldn't find the damn flag, and then I just gained a level.

211
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats.

212
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:15,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So what level are you now?

213
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:17,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you're going to do it.

214
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:17,004
37.

215
00:12:17,484 --> 00:12:17,644
In a row?

216
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:17,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

217
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:28,760
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think I've done okay for myself because I've gotten there in technically six days of playing.

218
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:30,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

219
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you've been jamming right along.

220
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Bochy Kawan, our chairman, says everyone jumps off of Teledrasil.

221
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:37,622
[SPEAKER_04]: It's normal.

222
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:40,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it like the Golden Gate?

223
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:41,323
Wow.

224
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:49,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Loomies in our chatroom says, I hope we have another I slept with a forum troll reveal.

225
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:51,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

226
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:54,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary, have you ever slept with a forum troll?

227
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:55,809
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

228
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we had a guest a couple weeks ago that apparently had, so.

229
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,211
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that forum trolls are fit for is machine gun targets.

230
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:06,252
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

231
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:07,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, though.

232
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:08,152
[SPEAKER_09]: But I got a melodica.

233
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:10,078
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

234
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, no, I did other stuff, but I don't remember, so fuck it.

235
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:31,841
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had a bunch of mame going on in the front room all day.

236
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:34,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard they were playing Moonwalker when we got here.

237
00:13:34,382 --> 00:13:35,142
[SPEAKER_04]: And they played too.

238
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:37,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

239
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:40,803
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, wait, I had to go.

240
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:41,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Ouch.

241
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:48,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, they've had the mame fest going on, and Dan has a new steering wheel for Gran Turismo 5.

242
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm never going to call a WoW player an addict again.

243
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:56,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to call Dan an addict.

244
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:59,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Bobby Blackwell joke.

245
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:03,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby is convinced that Gran Turismo 5 is not out because he's not seen it on a store shelf anywhere.

246
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:04,877
[SPEAKER_04]: But your husband somehow has it.

247
00:14:05,238 --> 00:14:05,678
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

248
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:10,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I can verify that it is out because sometimes I hear Dan yelling at it.

249
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:18,610
[SPEAKER_09]: That though, and the biggest thing that I'm going to give it is that it has the Top Gear track and it has the Stig.

250
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:24,036
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's instantly in my cool book forever because I freaking love the Stig.

251
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,902
[SPEAKER_09]: He listens to all kinds of interesting music and he may or may not be an alien.

252
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:32,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's go to Loki.

253
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:34,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your game week?

254
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:35,875
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

255
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:36,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't play a whole lot.

256
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:39,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Just playing the same stuff.

257
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:45,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been working on Grand Theft Auto stuff, just doing construction stuff with the mods.

258
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:51,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Then also, of course, I've been playing some iPod games.

259
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:54,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these aren't exactly new.

260
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, most of these aren't new.

261
00:14:57,069 --> 00:14:59,011
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're very similar types of games.

262
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:04,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Canabalt and I Must Run, both actually pretty much similar to Canabalt.

263
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:12,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Based off the Flash game where you run and have to jump over pits and stuff like that without dying and it keeps getting faster and faster.

264
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:17,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I must run, they try to add kind of a story to it, and it's kind of neat, and I like the presentation of it.

265
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:20,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I also played this game, NOM.

266
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:28,434
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like some time-traveling game that sort of reminds me of the art style of, like, Feel the Magic.

267
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:30,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of cool.

268
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:54,746
[SPEAKER_03]: and then also played more Swords & Poker 2 which unfortunately is not on the app store anymore and same with the first one, Swords & Poker 1 but thankfully though I have a jailbroken iPod so I don't have that problem and I'm glad because those games are very addicting

269
00:15:56,641 --> 00:16:04,827
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, I don't know if you noticed, but there was some new stuff actually coming on the App Store.

270
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:05,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty cool.

271
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:11,811
[SPEAKER_03]: They had one of the Tales games actually is now on the App Store.

272
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:18,115
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a fan of that series, you might want to check that out because it looks just like the Super NES Tales game.

273
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:24,839
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, let's see here, which Tales game was it?

274
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:32,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Tales, I guess, Tales of Weaver, Lucian Cults.

275
00:16:34,903 --> 00:16:38,244
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess it's based on the MMORPG.

276
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:43,387
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks like, you know, a nice 16-bit RPG game.

277
00:16:45,492 --> 00:17:00,695
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I will say, even though you've been kind of slowly going this way over the past six months, maybe the biggest change for 2011 isn't the fact that Loki is not bringing bacon pizza to the show, but the fact that I would have never said two years ago that Loki would be the one here reviewing games that are out on the iTouch.

278
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:07,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, call me crazy, but if you've listened to Loki's diatribes in the past on Apple products... I've already told you, though, it's...

279
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:09,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

280
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:11,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's still a little bizarre.

281
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,661
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Macs, not iThings.

282
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,364
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the iThings, they are expensive, but they're good.

283
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Macs, the Macs are fucking expensive.

284
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:22,927
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not good.

285
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:26,409
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get very good value for what you purchase.

286
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:33,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I mean, I would hope that if I'm spending $2,000 on a laptop that I'm getting something more than just one USB drive.

287
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if it's paper thin.

288
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a fucking computer that can do something.

289
00:17:38,998 --> 00:18:06,979
[SPEAKER_03]: so that's just my opinion but hey you know what teach their own and some people will buy you know Mac stuff forever and honestly I spent no money on this I had a stupid gift card that they gave me and it was either that or buying a bunch of Apple TVs to throw out a window or something I will say that Macs are still great for the graphics but now that Adobe's figured out that there's really a lot of PC users out there I have no need to have a Mac anymore

290
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:10,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I would need new underwear every day.

291
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:21,789
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty nice.

292
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:25,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Our graphics department has some of those and they're nice.

293
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:27,753
[SPEAKER_03]: But once again, it's a monitor.

294
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:31,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure that monitor is way overpriced for what it is.

295
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:38,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I could buy a TV and hook it up and it would cost less than the monitor.

296
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,264
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I have my iPod, which I can browse the web and stuff if I have a Wi-Fi spot.

297
00:18:43,284 --> 00:18:46,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have my phone, which I can browse the web too with that.

298
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:50,188
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, I hate my phone's web browser.

299
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:50,969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's terrible.

300
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:52,890
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's slow.

301
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,890
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of phone do you have?

302
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:00,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an Android phone, but it's a virgin mobile prepaid Android phone.

303
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:02,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's like a super Android.

304
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:05,254
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's like an Android light.

305
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:06,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Android that plays Snake.

306
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:16,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but it is an Android that I was able to root and add a thing to allow me to tether to it.

307
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:20,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just tether this to it and I'm able to browse the web.

308
00:19:20,263 --> 00:19:20,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love it.

309
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:21,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

310
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:30,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And I use this actually a lot now to browse the web and check my mail or whatever instead of having to go to my computer, boot it up, and do all that stuff.

311
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,350
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot quicker.

312
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I just do it on here.

313
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:34,852
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

314
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:03,268
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Loki, what would you say to the description of a Mac as an overpriced fashion accessory?

315
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:04,749
[SPEAKER_03]: True or false?

316
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:05,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something else?

317
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:37,166
[SPEAKER_03]: they buy into the brand and not necessarily it's for people they've kind of marketed them as PCs that are easy to use or laptops that are easy to use people don't want to try to learn stuff and they trust the Apple brand because it's been around forever and unfortunately people are willing to spend a lot of money for that

318
00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:41,691
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the impression I get, and I'm probably going to piss some Mac fans off, but oh well.

319
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:44,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I had an Apple laptop.

320
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:46,356
[SPEAKER_04]: It only lasted me a year, but I had it.

321
00:20:47,658 --> 00:20:54,626
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I kind of get the sense that Apple, a lot of their systems, and I don't know why we've turned into this Mac versus PC war, but...

322
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:55,927
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get past it in a minute.

323
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:56,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really preference.

324
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:58,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you want to buy one, go ahead.

325
00:20:58,469 --> 00:21:17,504
[SPEAKER_04]: But Macs are kind of like PC consoles to me and I think sometimes that's the advantage of them is that a lot of the software is very much customized for the Mac because their library is a little more limited than what you see on the PC and the expandability and customizability, while yes, I understand you can do some of it with Apple, they're not all over the fucking map like PCs are.

326
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,528
[SPEAKER_04]: There's zillions and zillions of different types of PCs, but there's only so many types of Macs.

327
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the software...

328
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,271
[SPEAKER_04]: by nature kind of is a little more optimized and runs a little better on Macs.

329
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:40,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the App Store coming to the Mac is a great idea because, you know, at least then you have a lot of different programs and tools and stuff that people can just fill their computer with, like I have with my iPod.

330
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:43,935
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a good idea and they'll really fit with it.

331
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:49,096
[SPEAKER_03]: But once again, it's basically just like, hey, look, it's just a more expensive iPad or something.

332
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:51,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's a computer iPad, you know.

333
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:52,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

334
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:52,937
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

335
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:54,674
[SPEAKER_05]: But iPads are so cute

336
00:22:13,543 --> 00:22:19,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, well, DarkSakura's husband's been kicking my ass thoroughly on Street Fighter 4 Super Turbo.

337
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:25,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yes, well, that goes without saying, I just started playing it, thank you.

338
00:22:25,395 --> 00:22:28,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I just said that I can't, that he can't help that he's not good at it.

339
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:31,982
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because I haven't played it since I was in junior high, thank you.

340
00:22:33,704 --> 00:22:42,252
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also just started playing Batman Arkham Asylum, finally, which the graphics are wow.

341
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:48,599
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I know I'm trying to come lately to that party, but it's still something... I haven't touched the game.

342
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:49,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

343
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I feel a little bit better, but still.

344
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:54,342
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fun game.

345
00:22:54,402 --> 00:23:00,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm told that you can beat it in about eight hours if you're dedicated, but I'll drag it out and enjoy it as long as I can.

346
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:07,490
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I recently acquired an Xbox 360, and that's been a lot of fun.

347
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:11,152
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm quite impressed.

348
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:19,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I also got a Samsung phone with Windows on it and I noticed it has the Xbox Live application.

349
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:23,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I have yet to go through the catalog and see what games are available to download.

350
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:25,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I saw Tetris as one of them.

351
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,763
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been a big thing they're pushing lately is that the whole achievements from your phone and all that.

352
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:37,868
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's kind of cool, and I'm kind of off subject here real quick, but we were talking about my phone.

353
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:44,712
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I like, and this is something that I wish they would do with Steam and stuff, is the Android Marketplace.

354
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:53,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Say you buy an app or something from them, and it either sucks or it doesn't work, you can get your money back and uninstall it.

355
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:54,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

356
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:54,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

357
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:55,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

358
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:57,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's awesome.

359
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't they have that?

360
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,641
[SPEAKER_03]: They should really have that.

361
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:00,922
[SPEAKER_05]: My iPhone lasts forever.

362
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:27,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the more you're online, the more you do the GPS-enabled stuff, of course, that's all going to be a battery drain.

363
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:29,769
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just want to make sure you're not running anything in the background that is always GPS.

364
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:34,910
[SPEAKER_01]: We were running the MP3 players from here to Washington and didn't use up the whole battery.

365
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprisingly enough, MP3 really doesn't use up much battery.

366
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was recording and Facebooking the entire way, too.

367
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:46,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It only uses up a lot of battery if you continuously skip through songs, I've noticed.

368
00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:48,313
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just let it play, yeah, it'll go forever.

369
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:49,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

370
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:54,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anything else for your gaming week you wish to share with us, Gary?

371
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:57,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just a lot of tabletop D&Ds.

372
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, that's right.

373
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:02,519
[SPEAKER_04]: You're into the old school types of games, not really old school.

374
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:11,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I like me some Final Fantasy too, and I've got a hold of Final Fantasy XIII and haven't had a chance to start it yet because I'm still one thing at a time.

375
00:25:12,205 --> 00:25:18,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the tabletop fans out there, because I know there's always a few, there's always a little bit of crossover between the video gaming circles and tabletop gaming circles.

376
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,611
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your tabletop games of choice right now?

377
00:25:23,495 --> 00:25:28,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing D&D since 2000, so I'm kind of getting burnt out on fantasy.

378
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:44,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at Hero System, I'm looking at Mutants and Masterminds from Green Ronin, which just recently released a DC Heroes role-playing game based on the Mutants and Masterminds system last fall, and they're going to put out the third edition of Mutants and Masterminds very, very shortly.

379
00:25:45,203 --> 00:25:45,904
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

380
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

381
00:25:57,121 --> 00:26:00,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of DC, there's a big new game coming out soon.

382
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:03,024
[SPEAKER_04]: The DC Universe Online is out in about, what, one, two weeks?

383
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:04,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen screencaps from that.

384
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:05,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks awesome.

385
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've played the beta on the PC.

386
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:07,787
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good times.

387
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:09,768
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit like if Ninja Turtles was an MMO.

388
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:12,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it is a lot of beat-em-up.

389
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,811
[SPEAKER_03]: It does come with a month of free play.

390
00:26:15,852 --> 00:26:17,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's customary, of course.

391
00:26:17,433 --> 00:26:18,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

392
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:20,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Might have to look into that one.

393
00:26:20,655 --> 00:26:20,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

394
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:22,550
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop GameStop GameStop

395
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:50,711
[SPEAKER_04]: And I played this at E3 and I was somewhat encouraged by what I saw with the whole Prince of Persia style fighting.

396
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:56,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was seeing the light bike races on another screen, although that ended up really being the Wii version.

397
00:26:57,114 --> 00:27:00,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played the Tron game and it sucks.

398
00:27:00,215 --> 00:27:00,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it.

399
00:27:02,436 --> 00:27:05,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really disappointed because Tron deserves a better game than this.

400
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:09,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry to say it, it was clearly, clearly...

401
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:25,082
[SPEAKER_04]: clearly rushed to make the movie release and this shit always happens with games based on movies and that's why none of them are ever any good I should say rarely are they good and unfortunately it just falls in that same bin where the best part about it was the Daft Punk soundtrack in the beginning

402
00:27:25,282 --> 00:27:30,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to kind of explain what happened between the first movie and the new movie.

403
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:32,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And the new movie does some of that flashback as well.

404
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:57,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there is overlap with the flashback sequences you see in the movie and what you play in the game.

405
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:01,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I think I'm just going to go on YouTube and try to find a compilation of all the cutscenes from the game.

406
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:04,141
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be more Tron games, you know.

407
00:28:04,722 --> 00:28:05,423
[SPEAKER_05]: It's inevitable.

408
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:06,409
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

409
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:30,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, and I'm doing the light bikes and they control like butt.

410
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:34,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And I crashed my light cycle, I shit you not, like seven times.

411
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:39,518
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole like acceleration, deceleration doesn't really flow.

412
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:45,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's this part where you are supposed to do this big jump, but if you haven't accelerated enough, you don't make the jump.

413
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:52,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm literally sitting there going, did anybody play this game to see if it was fun?

414
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:54,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's not fun.

415
00:28:55,228 --> 00:28:58,411
[SPEAKER_04]: and that is so frustrating because it's Tron.

416
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:01,554
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking Tron and it deserves to be so much better.

417
00:29:01,594 --> 00:29:02,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so mad.

418
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:03,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I will tell you this.

419
00:29:03,856 --> 00:29:06,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not, do not spend $60 on this game.

420
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:11,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Do spend 99 cents on the iPhone game that's out there because it's a better experience.

421
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:12,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I have that.

422
00:29:12,604 --> 00:29:13,144
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

423
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:15,967
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the other thing that I was trying to remember when I played.

424
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:16,847
[SPEAKER_09]: That game is fun.

425
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:19,449
[SPEAKER_05]: But you did see the movie, right?

426
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:20,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I fucking love the movie.

427
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know that they're doing it twice.

428
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:30,113
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing like a Clone Wars thing with it where they're going to have an animated series that's going to be between the first and second movies.

429
00:29:30,473 --> 00:29:31,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that sounds interesting.

430
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:34,114
[SPEAKER_09]: You should totally read the comics, by the way.

431
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:35,655
[SPEAKER_09]: The Betrayal.

432
00:29:36,155 --> 00:29:36,715
[SPEAKER_09]: They're really good.

433
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:39,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if there's any overlap with that in the game as well.

434
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:41,837
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me tell you, here's some of my problems with the game, you guys.

435
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:43,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, I'm sitting here going, it stinks.

436
00:29:44,218 --> 00:29:52,581
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is that a lot of the combat feels really repetitive and there's some frame rate issues when you're throwing the disc.

437
00:29:52,621 --> 00:29:56,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kind of seems to bounce all over the screen in random frames.

438
00:29:56,883 --> 00:30:00,985
[SPEAKER_04]: The multiplayer, what would you think multiplayer would be in Tron?

439
00:30:01,185 --> 00:30:04,226
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you think would be the first thing you're going to go into in a multiplayer in Tron?

440
00:30:04,446 --> 00:30:04,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody?

441
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:05,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Light Cycles?

442
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:06,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think?

443
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:06,929
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

444
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the disc thing.

445
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:09,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, it's a battle arena.

446
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:10,215
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the disc thing.

447
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:15,684
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just 20 people in a big clusterfuck arena all derezzing each other.

448
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,974
[SPEAKER_05]: There were no light cycles up front, huh?

449
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:40,957
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

450
00:30:41,197 --> 00:30:41,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not.

451
00:30:42,097 --> 00:30:46,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I went into this ultra-lame, 20-people-just-all-throwing-just-each-other mode.

452
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:48,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the light jets, you know?

453
00:30:48,702 --> 00:30:49,403
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been cool.

454
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:50,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the light jets would be awesome.

455
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:51,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

456
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the little, like, mosquito-looking guys in the movie.

457
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:54,247
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

458
00:30:54,927 --> 00:30:57,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Wyland in our chatroom says, play a real Tron game.

459
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:57,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Play 2.0.

460
00:30:58,169 --> 00:30:58,690
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

461
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot of good things about that game, and I probably should.

462
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:03,774
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably right.

463
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:04,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

464
00:31:05,675 --> 00:31:06,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to ask you about that.

465
00:31:07,376 --> 00:31:12,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Were there any other Tron games that came out before the movie besides 2.0?

466
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Tron 2.0 that I know of, and that's not counting any fan stuff.

467
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:22,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Tron sequel's been in development for quite some time, from what I understand.

468
00:31:22,266 --> 00:31:24,408
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been an absence of Tron things.

469
00:31:24,908 --> 00:31:29,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not counting Xbox Live Marketplace had rehashes of the Tron and Distotron.

470
00:31:29,691 --> 00:31:31,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even think you can get them anymore because of license issues.

471
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:35,975
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, if you don't count that, then... This is where it gets awesome.

472
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:37,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Tron Deadly Discs.

473
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:45,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and Wyland just wants to say, yeah, 2.0 is far, far better than Evolution.

474
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,480
[SPEAKER_04]: And TigerClaw says, Sky, light cycles are in there.

475
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the RB button that puts you in light cycle mode.

476
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:54,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, I know light cycles were like in the game, but is it multiplayer?

477
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:58,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I was like circling around the different arenas, it was all different types of melee.

478
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever.

479
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:07,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, call me an idiot if you want, but the fact that I couldn't find that very easy, I think speaks for itself, right?

480
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:09,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

481
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:10,639
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow.

482
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:18,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, if you must rent Tron for the story, do not, do not spend $50 or $60 on this game.

483
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:19,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go to the Tron Wiki.

484
00:32:21,187 --> 00:32:22,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already read the whole thing on the Tron Wiki.

485
00:32:22,928 --> 00:32:24,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, it's nice to see it.

486
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's fun to see the movie.

487
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:27,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Rent it.

488
00:32:28,032 --> 00:32:30,033
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at most worth a $5 rental.

489
00:32:30,674 --> 00:32:32,155
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could probably play through it in a weekend.

490
00:32:33,115 --> 00:32:36,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, most red boxes nowadays do have game rentals as well.

491
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:39,137
[SPEAKER_03]: You can rent it for one day for like two bucks.

492
00:32:39,177 --> 00:32:40,137
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

493
00:32:40,737 --> 00:32:44,498
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably, that sounds, from what you were saying, that sounds like about all it's worth.

494
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:47,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to move up the scale in games I played this week.

495
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:48,639
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the next game I played.

496
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,260
[SPEAKER_04]: White Knight Chronicles came out in 08.

497
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,261
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a level 5 game for the PlayStation 3.

498
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:54,821
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

499
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:58,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XI, the offline version almost?

500
00:32:58,702 --> 00:32:59,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

501
00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:02,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what the fuck this game is.

502
00:33:02,845 --> 00:33:05,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the weird thing about it.

503
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:16,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of feel like White Knight Chronicles is one of those games where it has a bit of an identity crisis where they try to do so much with it that they have a lot in the game but it doesn't do any of it exceedingly well.

504
00:33:17,753 --> 00:33:19,534
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not that I dislike the game.

505
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:23,637
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been interesting to me enough where I've sank like four hours in it so far.

506
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:26,678
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

507
00:33:26,778 --> 00:33:26,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

508
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:28,660
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

509
00:33:47,944 --> 00:34:12,850
[SPEAKER_04]: so okay whatever so the main character and his little lackey you go off on the adventures and you know you're killing things and the battle system is the closest thing I could compare it to is like Final Fantasy 12 it is an interesting battle system because you can kind of do like live attacks and things and the coolest part was that you can create combos based on your class and you can kind of like string these combos together that you've created and so it's kind of kind of cool like I like that um

510
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

511
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:37,946
[SPEAKER_04]: After you're about a couple hours into the story, it says, by the way, there's this whole geonet thing.

512
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:43,169
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hook up online and play with other people and get quests and do this stuff together.

513
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:49,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm like, oh, maybe that's why your character's been a lackey this whole time, because that's really going to be your online character.

514
00:34:50,092 --> 00:34:55,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though they had nothing to do with the single player mode, this character's going to be like your little online person.

515
00:34:56,255 --> 00:35:15,730
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't know and then the game starts to feel like now I'm playing Phantasy Star Universe there's all these quests that you can kind of do and there's recommended levels and you go out in the field and do your goal like it really kind of felt like Phantasy Star Universe where you play the single player for a little while and then all of a sudden it's like oh hey it's a multiplayer game too

516
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:18,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was really weird.

517
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:20,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how else to explain it.

518
00:35:20,395 --> 00:35:32,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes the camera can kind of bug and sometimes the battle system starts to feel a little bit like, okay, could I gain my little powers a little faster so I could do the cool stuff more often?

519
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Because right now this feels very slow moving.

520
00:35:34,868 --> 00:35:37,930
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, White Knight Chronicles, a bit of an identity crisis.

521
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't hate it.

522
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:46,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't love it, I like it, but I have a really difficult time explaining to anybody what the game is.

523
00:35:47,185 --> 00:35:49,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're rating them in a nutshell as just what, meh?

524
00:35:50,746 --> 00:36:01,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you like Japanese RPG type of games, and you like the more action-y based ones, like you like Phantasy Star Online, it's not press X to swing your sword.

525
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:03,892
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little more active time battle than that.

526
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:08,013
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you kind of like that sort of idea, then I think you'd like it.

527
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:12,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you like a grind fest, I think it would be permissible.

528
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:14,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially now that you can find it most places like $30, $35, that's a fair price to pay.

529
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:30,989
[SPEAKER_04]: considering it has a pretty robust online mode that you're not paying a monthly fee for so I'll give it that and I guess there's a sequel that came out in Japan but I don't think it's coming out here because unfortunately I do not believe the game did too well so there you go

530
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:35,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that was the weird thing.

531
00:36:37,097 --> 00:36:38,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I played Fallout 3.

532
00:36:39,418 --> 00:36:40,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I was partying like it was 2008.

533
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,839
[SPEAKER_04]: But I finally got a hold of this game on the used game sale.

534
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:49,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think the people describing it as oblivion with guns, really good.

535
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Great story though.

536
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I was totally into it in the beginning.

537
00:36:52,701 --> 00:36:58,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they do a great job kind of setting the stage as you're doing that whole like baby to child to adult and...

538
00:36:59,402 --> 00:37:26,844
[SPEAKER_04]: and all that and I don't want to spoil anything even though the game is like years old now but you know it's kind of like how you get to where you are in the story and why you're in a nuclear wasteland and all this stuff and yeah the only unfortunate thing about it is that if you don't save often like an NPC you might have wanted to do a quest for will end up dead and now you can't do that quest so save now save often that's really the only terrible thing I can think about it otherwise I gotta say the

539
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:51,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Another reason why I really like this game is that it's not just that it's, like, first-person shooter, but you can use some of, like, your little power by hitting the right bumper to go into, like, this, like, focus attack mode where if I suck at first-person shooters, at least if I'm, like, kind of, like, stealthy enough and save up those action points, I can still shoot someone in the head with a very accurate shot because it basically stops the game and you can focus on a part of the body and it tells you the percentage.

540
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's sort of bullet time.

541
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little bit because it tells you, like, the percentage of success.

542
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:55,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.

543
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:56,662
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was kind of neat.

544
00:37:57,202 --> 00:38:12,759
[SPEAKER_04]: so yeah I like Fallout and it's a beautiful game and there's so much to it and if you have the game of the year edition you just have quest upon quest upon quest so yeah I've already sank quite a few hours into that game so I liked my Fallout 3

545
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:15,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

546
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:17,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Something else I want to talk about.

547
00:38:17,623 --> 00:38:23,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had 11 days in a row off of work because at my work we take the entire time between Christmas and New Year's off.

548
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:25,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a PTO thing.

549
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:26,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't get into details.

550
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:26,571
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we do.

551
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:30,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've had 11 days to kind of play some games and so forth.

552
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:33,375
[SPEAKER_04]: One day I decided, you know what?

553
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:35,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to watch The Tester, season two.

554
00:38:35,595 --> 00:38:37,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to just download every single episode.

555
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:38,616
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to watch the whole damn thing.

556
00:38:39,576 --> 00:38:40,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Shermie, don't listen.

557
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:40,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Shermie.

558
00:38:41,637 --> 00:38:43,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Has Shermie's bowels been voided?

559
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Shermie's asleep, so hopefully she won't hear me talking about this.

560
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:48,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to admit something, you guys.

561
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:51,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually a pretty good show.

562
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,040
[SPEAKER_04]: It was better than the first season, what I watched of it.

563
00:38:55,821 --> 00:39:20,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the show now here's the show if you haven't heard of it it's like a you can only download the show it's only available on PlayStation Network and it's a show about people that are imagine it's The Apprentice but like the Donald Trump show you're fired but it's with video games and the ultimate job is to become the PlayStation tester which is why this show is getting a lot of shit because what a glamorous job game testing is right but what I like about the show

564
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:32,112
[SPEAKER_04]: What I ended up ultimately liking about it was that it didn't really hide the fact that none of these people really had the goal of being a PlayStation tester.

565
00:39:33,193 --> 00:39:42,020
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them said, fully self-aware, I want this job to get my foot in the door so I can work with these people to work my way up.

566
00:39:42,661 --> 00:39:46,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And like this one girl, she even says in one episode, you know what, I don't even own a PlayStation 3.

567
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:49,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make games for children.

568
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:51,769
[SPEAKER_04]: and you might kind of look at that and go, what?

569
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:52,690
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even know PlayStation 3?

570
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:53,751
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell are you doing on this show?

571
00:39:53,771 --> 00:40:05,022
[SPEAKER_04]: But I kind of looked at that going, that's really kind of honest of Sony to have in there because if you think everybody that's working in the video game industry right now grew up on video games, you've got a wake-up call coming.

572
00:40:05,763 --> 00:40:10,147
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I thought it was a very kind of like honest response and another guy had said, you know what?

573
00:40:10,227 --> 00:40:11,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do this so I can get into PR.

574
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:27,687
[SPEAKER_04]: and uh yeah so it seemed like everybody that was kind of on the show like actually really wanted to be there and i have to admit i can't remember the last time i saw a reality show where by the time it was down to the last episode the final three people like i would have been happy with any any single one of them winning

575
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:36,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, ultimately the person that won, I thought was, uh, uh, a person that was really going to use, uh, you know, their, their potential and so forth.

576
00:40:36,592 --> 00:40:39,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would have been happy if Sony had really ended up hiring any of them.

577
00:40:39,433 --> 00:40:41,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, they, they, I thought they'd kind of told a good story.

578
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:46,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so when I say like, oh my gosh, you should drop everything you're doing and watch this show.

579
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:51,460
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean like really, I should have been like trying to catch up on True Blood or some other show.

580
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I was watching this.

581
00:40:52,981 --> 00:40:53,862
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

582
00:41:14,426 --> 00:41:16,327
[SPEAKER_04]: What does this have to do with game testing?

583
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:17,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have anything to do with game testing?

584
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:19,087
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's TV.

585
00:41:19,468 --> 00:41:20,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at The Apprentice.

586
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:25,569
[SPEAKER_04]: What does a lot of the crap they do on that show have to do with actually running a company?

587
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:31,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot, but usually there's that one little tip in it that is kind of the focus of the episode.

588
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:32,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the same thing.

589
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this show is a complete ripoff of The Apprentice in many ways.

590
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:39,394
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I really didn't hate it.

591
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:41,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

592
00:41:55,405 --> 00:42:08,111
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that didn't even want to be there or were just cast, the very first person that was off that show, I was like, if this person lasts in the show, I'm going to just swallow my own tongue or something.

593
00:42:08,171 --> 00:42:09,532
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just terrible.

594
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,693
[SPEAKER_04]: But the very first person they kicked off was the right person.

595
00:42:11,773 --> 00:42:13,094
[SPEAKER_04]: It was somebody who didn't even need to be there.

596
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:14,415
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

597
00:42:33,581 --> 00:42:40,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Bochikawa in our chatroom says, Oh, Tester, I thought that it was interesting this run.

598
00:42:40,703 --> 00:42:42,324
[SPEAKER_04]: That jerk must have been a plant.

599
00:42:42,684 --> 00:42:46,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't think anyone would go that far to be an asshole and would get anywhere near thinking he wants a job.

600
00:42:47,586 --> 00:42:48,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're right.

601
00:42:48,406 --> 00:42:50,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he was one of those people that was cast for drama.

602
00:42:50,547 --> 00:42:59,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe he did want the job, but not as bad as the people that ultimately make it to the final episode and that do end up ultimately getting the job.

603
00:42:59,650 --> 00:42:59,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

604
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there you go.

605
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:02,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as terrible as I would have thought.

606
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I was surprised.

607
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:05,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you would be too.

608
00:43:05,226 --> 00:43:05,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

609
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:06,897
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it.

610
00:43:06,977 --> 00:43:07,978
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for my gaming week.

611
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:10,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's quickly do some housekeeping.

612
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:14,904
[SPEAKER_04]: You can join us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

613
00:43:15,224 --> 00:43:17,305
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be taking some tweets later on in the show, of course.

614
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:22,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will be, of course, looking at our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

615
00:43:22,749 --> 00:43:28,394
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't already have us on Facebook, please consider adding us, facebook.com slash orangeloungeradio.

616
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:31,056
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, we'll get into some gaming news tonight.

617
00:43:31,136 --> 00:43:32,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And Loki, as always, will start us off.

618
00:43:33,164 --> 00:43:35,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and this is kind of interesting.

619
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:41,732
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the PlayStation 3 hacking news, it's kind of been going back and forth as far.

620
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:46,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we found a crack, and oh hey, we patched a crack, and so on and so forth.

621
00:43:47,077 --> 00:43:49,479
[SPEAKER_03]: But this, I don't know if they can be able to recover from.

622
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:56,125
[SPEAKER_03]: During the kind of hacker conference going on right now, the Chaos Communications Conference 27C3,

623
00:43:58,547 --> 00:44:13,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, apparently the hackers responsible for the Wii's homebrew channel, um, who I guess is the group called, uh, Fail Overflow, gave a presentation, um, which they've said they figured out the private key, uh, Sony uses to authorize code to run on retail PS3 systems.

624
00:44:14,336 --> 00:44:22,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what that means is that hackers would have almost full control of the PS3 system without the use of a USB device.

625
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:27,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, basically it means they'd be able to sign their own code and you'd be able to, uh,

626
00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:37,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a lot of things on there, including their whole big thing is to run Linux on PS3s, whatever the firmware version is.

627
00:44:38,058 --> 00:44:40,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they're not really interested in piracy with this.

628
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:48,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, people could adapt it to do that, but they're really kind of concerned with just the applications of it and...

629
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:59,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the things that was kind of neat about it is that they literally have almost access to all the cores and everything using this.

630
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:00,940
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of neat.

631
00:45:01,821 --> 00:45:06,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Who saw this punchline coming a mile away when the PlayStation 3 first did away with Linux?

632
00:45:06,485 --> 00:45:10,049
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually hard-coded into each console.

633
00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:11,350
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way to patch this.

634
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:13,939
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't.

635
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:15,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

636
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, what they can do is they create keys or whatever.

637
00:45:20,062 --> 00:45:23,424
[SPEAKER_03]: These USB devices have keys on them assigned to them.

638
00:45:23,564 --> 00:45:31,189
[SPEAKER_03]: What they've done to prevent those jailbreak devices from working is they add blacklists for different keys.

639
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:35,151
[SPEAKER_03]: The master key, you can create your own keys from it.

640
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,372
[SPEAKER_03]: They block one, you can just create another one.

641
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:40,794
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just impossible to stop it.

642
00:45:42,196 --> 00:45:43,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happens now?

643
00:45:43,097 --> 00:45:44,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Piracy runs rampant?

644
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:45,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily.

645
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Their whole big thing is they're not aiming towards piracy.

646
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:53,007
[SPEAKER_03]: They just want to bring homebrew to the PS3.

647
00:45:53,768 --> 00:45:56,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Linux is really what they're looking to do.

648
00:45:56,611 --> 00:45:58,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's bring Linux back, I guess.

649
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:04,050
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't you think this would have also been a conclusion anyway, even if Sony hadn't done away with Linux?

650
00:46:04,551 --> 00:46:06,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that maybe they were working on this anyway?

651
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:10,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I mean, I guess, you know, what do we know?

652
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:14,197
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not in this little organization or whatever, but it's just interesting to me.

653
00:46:14,237 --> 00:46:22,462
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting that, you know, Sony kind of pulls the plug on the whole Linux thing because they were worried about people exploiting it for piracy, really, at the end of the day.

654
00:46:22,943 --> 00:46:27,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's like, well, we're just going to shove Linux in this thing whether you like it or not.

655
00:46:28,206 --> 00:46:33,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they can install Linux on a frickin' toaster, they can install Linux on a hacker-proof PSP.

656
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:39,614
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably worse than the whole exploit through Linux to begin with.

657
00:46:39,654 --> 00:46:44,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of people may not have had Linux on their system, or weren't even interested in that.

658
00:46:44,717 --> 00:46:54,044
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact that they took it away, and people don't like when things are taken away, especially when they've paid for them, whether it's an advertised feature or not, I don't care.

659
00:46:55,285 --> 00:46:56,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, to be fair, just devil's advocate...

660
00:46:57,586 --> 00:47:00,487
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to patch your PlayStation 3 to remove the Linux.

661
00:47:00,847 --> 00:47:03,007
[SPEAKER_04]: You just won't be able to play any games in the past year or two.

662
00:47:03,027 --> 00:47:05,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Functionality is removed from your system.

663
00:47:06,228 --> 00:47:07,208
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically it.

664
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:10,949
[SPEAKER_03]: We can either say, oh, well, you could lose Linux.

665
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:15,411
[SPEAKER_04]: You get column A, games made in 2010, or you get column B, Linux.

666
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:16,751
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have both.

667
00:47:17,552 --> 00:47:19,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's kind of lame.

668
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:25,756
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to be interesting to see where this goes from here because that's bad.

669
00:47:26,616 --> 00:47:31,118
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt in our chatroom says, I don't know, I still think people are going to use it to pirate games.

670
00:47:31,218 --> 00:47:32,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yes, of course.

671
00:47:32,799 --> 00:47:34,740
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people out there that are going to do that.

672
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,542
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't doubt that they're going to find ways to do that.

673
00:47:39,582 --> 00:47:44,184
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just that the aim of this group wasn't to just...

674
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:46,286
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

675
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:06,726
[SPEAKER_04]: while I'm sure there's some people working for Sony 365 days a year, there's probably a lot of people coming back tomorrow.

676
00:48:06,746 --> 00:48:09,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be interesting to see what their kind of response is.

677
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,107
[SPEAKER_04]: If they do try to patch it.

678
00:48:11,147 --> 00:48:12,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you say it's unpatchable.

679
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:13,768
[SPEAKER_04]: They try to do something.

680
00:48:13,788 --> 00:48:14,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they've got to.

681
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:16,408
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of owe it to their third party.

682
00:48:16,428 --> 00:48:18,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they've got a lot of things.

683
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:22,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Even just after this conference, they have things being released.

684
00:48:22,689 --> 00:48:25,390
[SPEAKER_03]: That group has already released the development tools for...

685
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:27,251
[SPEAKER_03]: The stuff that they have.

686
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:44,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So now they have different, you know, like early code and stuff to code to pack and unpack PUP and package files to make and read selfs and other developer related stuff.

687
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:49,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, look forward to possibly, you know, custom firmware and whatnot.

688
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:51,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've already released the root key.

689
00:48:51,704 --> 00:48:53,405
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean...

690
00:48:55,103 --> 00:48:56,204
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

691
00:49:18,297 --> 00:49:18,737
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

692
00:49:37,086 --> 00:49:38,587
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

693
00:50:04,964 --> 00:50:05,244
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

694
00:50:21,463 --> 00:50:27,067
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want gamers to be asking, what's the difference between a PlayStation phone or a phone and a PSP?

695
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:30,210
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to come up with a message that users will understand.

696
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:34,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have to be a product that keeps the PlayStation's strengths intact.

697
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:42,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, sort of, you know, kind of not outright saying there's a PlayStation phone, but saying, you know, we're trying to kind of...

698
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:45,662
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do it right.

699
00:50:45,762 --> 00:50:46,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, we're doing it right.

700
00:50:46,723 --> 00:50:47,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise for once.

701
00:50:47,924 --> 00:50:49,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

702
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:51,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

703
00:50:51,406 --> 00:50:54,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Consumer Electronics Show is this weekend, if I'm not mistaken, or this week.

704
00:50:54,548 --> 00:50:55,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so.

705
00:50:55,628 --> 00:51:00,972
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might see it there, but I mean, if it's... I would say this.

706
00:51:01,132 --> 00:51:06,615
[SPEAKER_04]: If the phone and the PSP2 are separate, I would say you'll see the phone at CES.

707
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:09,557
[SPEAKER_04]: You might see it as soon as CES, possibly Game Developers Conference.

708
00:51:10,177 --> 00:51:12,318
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP2, however, E3.

709
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Developers Conference Game Developers Conference

710
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:29,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcade Infinity

711
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

712
00:51:59,501 --> 00:51:59,961
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gone.

713
00:52:01,722 --> 00:52:02,823
[SPEAKER_04]: The inevitable has happened, huh?

714
00:52:02,843 --> 00:52:07,646
[SPEAKER_09]: It's closing on January 15th, so we need to go take a trip to LA, like now.

715
00:52:07,787 --> 00:52:08,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Like tomorrow, yeah.

716
00:52:08,707 --> 00:52:09,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

717
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:11,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck, right?

718
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:17,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, Arcade Infinity was the big place that got a lot of RB money in the US.

719
00:52:18,894 --> 00:52:21,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just that, but a lot of just import games in general.

720
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:26,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I played an Oom Jam Alami arcade machine at Arcade Infinity.

721
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:28,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And the tambourine version of Samba de Amigo.

722
00:52:28,621 --> 00:52:31,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, by the way, is the gayest video game I've ever played in my life.

723
00:52:32,063 --> 00:52:35,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tambourined or whatever.

724
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:37,967
[SPEAKER_04]: You shake around a tambourine like you're Stevie Nicks.

725
00:52:38,047 --> 00:52:38,527
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

726
00:52:40,629 --> 00:52:42,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Except without the big hobo.

727
00:52:44,841 --> 00:52:45,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I meant Boho stuff.

728
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:20,676
[SPEAKER_04]: that was the first place I ever played Typing of the Dead yeah I know and we're like oh my god it's in Japanese we could get as far as the boss that would ask you questions and you'd have to answer them and then it'd be like shit I don't know Japanese I can't do it

729
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,683
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, man, I just have so many good memories of that place.

730
00:53:26,783 --> 00:53:31,046
[SPEAKER_09]: But now, you know, it's going to be closing.

731
00:53:31,446 --> 00:53:32,187
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going away.

732
00:53:32,827 --> 00:53:34,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I gotta be honest.

733
00:53:34,368 --> 00:53:40,292
[SPEAKER_04]: The last time I was there, it didn't have quite the wonder that it had, you know, when I was there back in its heyday.

734
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:43,617
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's sadly arcades in general.

735
00:53:43,697 --> 00:53:50,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hate to say it, but man, the online stuff is really taking its toll.

736
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's kind of obvious.

737
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:58,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, the other thing that they were doing there was selling import skylines.

738
00:53:59,624 --> 00:54:01,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Like bringing in cars from Japan.

739
00:54:01,025 --> 00:54:01,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, I remember that.

740
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,746
[SPEAKER_09]: And trying to make them street legal for sale in the U.S.

741
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:05,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

742
00:54:06,688 --> 00:54:11,894
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, apparently Bimani-style folks are having a gathering there for the last day.

743
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:20,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Our buddy DJ Tyrant, who once in a while does some stories for OrangeLaundry.com, he's going to go and give us a little report.

744
00:54:20,685 --> 00:54:23,249
[SPEAKER_04]: So since I can't be there, it'll be nice to have somebody there.

745
00:54:23,529 --> 00:54:24,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring me back a token.

746
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,052
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably have a bunch still somewhere.

747
00:54:27,092 --> 00:54:30,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I've got some somewhere, but that's just really sad.

748
00:54:30,995 --> 00:54:42,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, I mean, whenever we would go to LA, we would always make it a point that we were going to go to Arcade Infinity and then we'd go have dinner at that place that you had to walk all the way freaking across a football field-sized parking lot to go eat at.

749
00:54:43,727 --> 00:54:45,369
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'd go back and play more games.

750
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:48,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, it's just sad.

751
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:49,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very sad.

752
00:54:50,697 --> 00:55:12,482
[SPEAKER_04]: what's just sad in general that here's another great arcade closing its doors and this is a trend we saw starting years ago with what Southern Hills Golf Land Folsom Game Room you know all these arcades just started closing and closing and even the arcades that are still there which would be like Roseville Golf Land and some of the other golf lands that are out there are nothing but ticket redemption machines now you know what I mean

753
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Shermie's trying to get out so she can go poop on the tester.

754
00:55:15,903 --> 00:55:17,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, I figured as much.

755
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:18,385
[SPEAKER_04]: She's probably trying to get out.

756
00:55:19,005 --> 00:55:19,466
[SPEAKER_09]: No, she's fine.

757
00:55:19,766 --> 00:55:19,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

758
00:55:19,866 --> 00:55:20,927
[SPEAKER_04]: She's sitting underneath your butt.

759
00:55:20,947 --> 00:55:22,128
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as she doesn't poop in the corner.

760
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:23,409
[SPEAKER_09]: She's sitting underneath you.

761
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:23,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

762
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:28,934
[SPEAKER_09]: But Shermie is equally sad about the closure of Arcade Infinity.

763
00:55:29,115 --> 00:55:29,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It is sad.

764
00:55:29,615 --> 00:55:33,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, certainly back in the heyday, that was the only place I could play Keyboard Mania.

765
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:33,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

766
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:34,860
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

767
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:39,335
[SPEAKER_09]: and I just remember playing the crap out of that Gundam game.

768
00:55:39,695 --> 00:55:43,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, somebody needs to take a 40 and pour it out in the parking lot.

769
00:55:43,197 --> 00:55:46,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what they're doing with the rest of their candy cabs because they were selling them.

770
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, I only have good beer so I'm not going to do that.

771
00:55:49,842 --> 00:55:52,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to BevMo and get one crappy beer so you can.

772
00:55:52,944 --> 00:55:54,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Ice cold, Colt 45.

773
00:55:55,206 --> 00:55:58,488
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Tyrant, Colt 45, dump it in the lot.

774
00:55:58,768 --> 00:55:59,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

775
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:00,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, and take pictures of it.

776
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:01,490
[SPEAKER_04]: On behalf of OLR.

777
00:56:01,851 --> 00:56:02,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Take pictures of it.

778
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:05,133
[SPEAKER_04]: One for me and one for my homies.

779
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Rest in peace, Arcade Infinity.

780
00:56:08,381 --> 00:56:09,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to see you go.

781
00:56:09,362 --> 00:56:10,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what they're doing with their cabinets.

782
00:56:12,425 --> 00:56:13,226
[SPEAKER_04]: You opportunist.

783
00:56:13,446 --> 00:56:15,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the same thing that Tilt at the Metron is doing.

784
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:17,610
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to get a Beat Mania machine for 300 bucks?

785
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:26,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I should check... Speaking of other arcades that have gone away, you get a Marvel vs. Capcom for 300 bucks.

786
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:29,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan saw that and he said, Christmas, Rob, Christmas!

787
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:29,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Christmas!

788
00:56:32,063 --> 00:56:33,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor, Alan, poor!

789
00:56:34,229 --> 00:56:35,970
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

790
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:37,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

791
00:56:37,332 --> 00:56:44,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Nintendo is warning that you shouldn't have children under the age of six playing the 3DS in 3D mode.

792
00:56:44,517 --> 00:56:46,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, it'll make them go cross-eyed.

793
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:50,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not the reason, but it may hurt their vision.

794
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's bad.

795
00:56:53,865 --> 00:56:57,488
[SPEAKER_03]: So, don't play it in 3D mode unless you want cross-eyed kids.

796
00:56:58,269 --> 00:56:59,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, come on.

797
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:06,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely it can't be that you play this for five minutes and you're going to go cross-eyed.

798
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:10,578
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about prolonged exposure is what this is.

799
00:57:11,738 --> 00:57:14,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's probably overreacting so there isn't a lawsuit.

800
00:57:14,881 --> 00:57:21,385
[SPEAKER_04]: When at the end of the day, this really comes down to parents, you really should watch how much games your six-year-old is playing.

801
00:57:21,545 --> 00:57:30,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and that brings up a wonderful point, is that you can use the included parental controls that allow parents to lock the device in 2D mode.

802
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:34,150
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the 3DS, 2DS.

803
00:57:36,175 --> 00:57:36,935
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

804
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:24,559
[SPEAKER_04]: but uh you know they were showing a trailer for Tangled you know the Rapunzel movie that's out in theaters by the way it was actually really good I saw it yesterday um they were showing a trailer for that at E3 on 3DS so they're gonna market 3D movies for kids on these things so you know I mean granted you could say that well Tangled would also work for a 10 to 15 to an adult really you're old come on

805
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:26,960
[SPEAKER_04]: To an adult year old?

806
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,020
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean.

807
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:33,443
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what parent isn't going to want to sit their six year old in the back of the car and have them watch Tangled to shut them up on a road trip?

808
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:34,523
[SPEAKER_04]: In 3D!

809
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:36,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what's great?

810
00:58:36,144 --> 00:58:42,507
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be like buying an expensive 3D HD television and going, you know what?

811
00:58:43,127 --> 00:58:43,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm watching all 2D.

812
00:58:45,925 --> 00:58:47,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need this 3D.

813
00:58:47,668 --> 00:58:52,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pay your high premium price for your TV with fancy technology.

814
00:58:52,775 --> 00:58:53,817
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, you know what?

815
00:58:54,017 --> 00:58:55,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even hooking up HDMI to it.

816
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going straight composite, bitch.

817
00:58:58,844 --> 00:59:00,967
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Nintendo is paranoid.

818
00:59:01,508 --> 00:59:15,312
[SPEAKER_04]: that some kid somewhere is going to go cross-eyed because they spent 12 hours a day looking at the 3DS and so they're putting this disclaimer on it to kind of save their own butt because some parents can't be bothered to watch how much their kids are playing games.

819
00:59:15,492 --> 00:59:16,873
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the story should really say, right?

820
00:59:18,813 --> 00:59:19,634
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what I think.

821
00:59:19,694 --> 00:59:20,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Enablers.

822
00:59:21,594 --> 00:59:24,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this chat room chatter here.

823
00:59:25,117 --> 00:59:26,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Big wang eater.

824
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:31,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'd be cool if 3DS had a deer hunter in 3D.

825
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:32,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

826
00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:33,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Cabela's comes out each year.

827
00:59:33,505 --> 00:59:35,707
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been doing a lot of games on the DS.

828
00:59:36,107 --> 00:59:39,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not be surprised if you see a 3DS Cabela's game.

829
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:43,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And somewhere, somehow, some idiot parent will let their kid play that.

830
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Their six-year-old kid play that in 3D.

831
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:45,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Big wang eater.

832
00:59:46,456 --> 00:59:47,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, big wang eater.

833
00:59:48,499 --> 00:59:49,360
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

834
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,080
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D porn.

835
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the big wing eater goes on to say 3D porn.

836
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:55,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, you will be able to take your own 3D pictures with this.

837
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:58,605
[SPEAKER_04]: You can show the big wing being eaten.

838
00:59:58,885 --> 01:00:00,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you share the pictures you take on the internet or whatever?

839
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:01,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can.

840
01:00:01,446 --> 01:00:01,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

841
01:00:02,287 --> 01:00:02,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot.

842
01:00:02,647 --> 01:00:03,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Time to penis.

843
01:00:03,807 --> 01:00:04,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Five seconds.

844
01:00:04,888 --> 01:00:05,789
[SPEAKER_09]: He said coming at you.

845
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:09,310
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

846
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:17,773
[SPEAKER_09]: See, some of us actually have people that we can do this in real life with and don't need to watch it in 3D.

847
01:00:18,233 --> 01:00:20,014
[SPEAKER_09]: We have what's called real life.

848
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:30,758
[SPEAKER_04]: They've also already been marketing, like when I did see that whole Tangled movie, which by the way, I saw lots of six-year-olds in that theater wearing 3D glasses and watching the movie, but anyway.

849
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:35,221
[SPEAKER_04]: They were showing a commercial for a 3D camera.

850
01:00:35,641 --> 01:00:39,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could watch the pictures on your 3D TV that you take with the new camera.

851
01:00:40,364 --> 01:00:41,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And this isn't DS related.

852
01:00:41,665 --> 01:00:44,327
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a new Sony camera or whatever that does 3D pictures.

853
01:00:44,527 --> 01:00:47,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everybody has a boner for 3D right now.

854
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:49,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I like what Azim said.

855
01:00:49,931 --> 01:00:51,092
[SPEAKER_09]: 4D porn sex across time.

856
01:00:51,112 --> 01:00:52,393
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

857
01:00:53,774 --> 01:00:54,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I approve of that.

858
01:00:55,795 --> 01:00:56,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

859
01:00:56,636 --> 01:00:57,897
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you need a TARDIS for.

860
01:00:59,011 --> 01:01:03,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, moving on to other things Nintendo that aren't necessarily 3D, but I bet a lot of people wish this was.

861
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,633
[SPEAKER_04]: The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.

862
01:01:05,673 --> 01:01:06,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, remember?

863
01:01:06,554 --> 01:01:07,994
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a new Zelda game coming, you guys.

864
01:01:08,034 --> 01:01:08,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember?

865
01:01:09,135 --> 01:01:11,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he have the upward thrust?

866
01:01:11,316 --> 01:01:14,337
[SPEAKER_04]: They were talking about it at E3 and it was delayed from Christmas.

867
01:01:14,697 --> 01:01:15,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob ignored it.

868
01:01:15,597 --> 01:01:15,797
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

869
01:01:16,077 --> 01:01:17,398
[SPEAKER_01]: As if he has the upward thrust.

870
01:01:19,419 --> 01:01:20,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Only in 2D, I'm sorry.

871
01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:22,300
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the deal, guys.

872
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:29,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only has it been delayed past Christmas, but now Nintendo is kind of saying, yeah, that whole early 2011 thing.

873
01:01:30,102 --> 01:01:30,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Liars!

874
01:01:31,043 --> 01:01:32,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's going to happen.

875
01:01:32,603 --> 01:01:35,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, of course, there is very dense gameplay.

876
01:01:36,165 --> 01:01:38,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to want to replay this game once you've finished it.

877
01:01:39,086 --> 01:01:39,726
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a...

878
01:01:40,306 --> 01:01:42,667
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a description for gameplay.

879
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:47,029
[SPEAKER_04]: They have quietly moved this game to a 2011 release.

880
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:49,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Could be any time next year.

881
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:54,072
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to save it for our VHD.

882
01:01:54,312 --> 01:01:56,333
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a game that's slightly uprest.

883
01:01:57,639 --> 01:02:00,501
[SPEAKER_04]: That sound you heard in the background, that was crickets chirping.

884
01:02:00,521 --> 01:02:01,502
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a soundboard for that.

885
01:02:01,642 --> 01:02:02,243
[SPEAKER_04]: That was me blinking.

886
01:02:30,717 --> 01:02:35,960
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw in our chatroom talking about 3D, by the way, says 3D TVs are way behind in the 3D technology.

887
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:40,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Theaters now are using polarized lenses, which doesn't need to use the shutter glasses technology.

888
01:02:41,322 --> 01:02:44,044
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, you don't have to recharge the glasses to watch 3D.

889
01:02:44,144 --> 01:02:51,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and that's what I'm saying they need to fucking do with those damn TVs, because those glasses are like $5 or free if you steal them from the movie theaters.

890
01:02:53,174 --> 01:02:53,975
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not stealing them.

891
01:02:53,995 --> 01:02:55,455
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying the premium for them anyway.

892
01:02:55,475 --> 01:02:57,116
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just asking you to recycle them.

893
01:02:57,497 --> 01:02:58,497
[SPEAKER_03]: They can go fuck themselves.

894
01:02:58,537 --> 01:02:59,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm paying for those damn glasses.

895
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:00,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually.

896
01:03:00,779 --> 01:03:06,042
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're still going to charge you the full theater price when you bring in, whether or not you bring in your own pair of 3D glasses, it seems like.

897
01:03:06,262 --> 01:03:08,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I thought it was a great suggestion.

898
01:03:08,423 --> 01:03:19,050
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my friends has suggested, after seeing Tron, you know, we should keep these glasses and we should, like, bling them out and, like, you know, bedazzle them and you'll put, like, pipe cleaner designs on them and all this.

899
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:22,131
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way, you know, next time they try to hand you 3D glasses, oh, no, thanks.

900
01:03:22,412 --> 01:03:22,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought my own.

901
01:03:24,053 --> 01:03:28,979
[SPEAKER_03]: They have designer polarized glasses you can pay hundreds of dollars for.

902
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:29,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

903
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:30,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

904
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:31,002
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

905
01:03:31,082 --> 01:03:37,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually hold onto those to wear over my glasses for when I go outside in the sun.

906
01:03:38,832 --> 01:03:39,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

907
01:03:39,052 --> 01:03:40,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, do those things work?

908
01:03:41,534 --> 01:03:44,577
[SPEAKER_05]: The 3D glasses for the theater, they don't work with the TVs, do they?

909
01:03:44,657 --> 01:03:45,037
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

910
01:03:45,057 --> 01:03:46,839
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what we were saying.

911
01:03:47,279 --> 01:03:48,600
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.

912
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:57,609
[SPEAKER_03]: The only 3D technology they think that's worthwhile is the Disney one, just because it uses the polarized glasses, and...

913
01:03:58,249 --> 01:04:22,846
[SPEAKER_03]: or Nintendo's new technology which uses nothing at all exactly and they're actually they're looking to do TVs that way too which I think would you know really hurt your eyes but I think that the polarized glasses are it's a good alternative because in that way instead of saying yeah you gotta buy this 3D TV oh by the way if you want more than two people to watch that you're gonna need to buy another set of $100 glasses no thank you

914
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:32,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, so Zelda Skyward Sword, 2D, 3D, whatever D it's in, it's probably not coming out until December.

915
01:04:33,381 --> 01:04:33,601
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

916
01:04:33,981 --> 01:04:34,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Upward thrust.

917
01:04:35,563 --> 01:04:36,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

918
01:04:37,205 --> 01:04:42,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, Final Fantasy XIII came out for the Xbox 360 in Japan, and guess what?

919
01:04:44,707 --> 01:04:45,507
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how well it did.

920
01:04:46,568 --> 01:04:53,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It showed up at 39th in the software charts for Japan, which is really low.

921
01:04:55,333 --> 01:04:59,615
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, they only sold... Well, I'll put it this way.

922
01:04:59,655 --> 01:05:02,337
[SPEAKER_09]: The game that made number 20 sold 22,579 units.

923
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:03,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

924
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:10,401
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of... So it probably sold about 10,000 or whatever.

925
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:10,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

926
01:05:10,942 --> 01:05:12,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that how many A360 owners there are in Japan?

927
01:05:14,797 --> 01:05:19,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's under 1.5 million users in Japan.

928
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And keep in mind, the PS3 is close to 6 million.

929
01:05:25,582 --> 01:05:33,947
[SPEAKER_09]: So, basically, there were a lot of... Also because of how early Final Fantasy XIII came out in Japan.

930
01:05:34,427 --> 01:05:36,988
[SPEAKER_09]: And they thought it was only going to be for PlayStation 3.

931
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,350
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of people bought a PlayStation 3 just to play Final Fantasy.

932
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:50,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, when I first kind of heard about this story earlier in the week, I had gotten into Double Take and said, I thought they specifically said they are not doing 360 Final Fantasy XIII in Japan.

933
01:05:50,675 --> 01:05:51,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So where the hell did this come from?

934
01:05:52,512 --> 01:05:53,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

935
01:06:22,627 --> 01:06:46,024
[SPEAKER_09]: and yeah I'm trying to watch this comparison to to see you know what the deal is and the Xbox 360 one actually kind of looks like poop in comparison oh no it doesn't they look the same I I think people look way too I think in order to see that level of detail you have to be a sitting as close to your TV as you're sitting next to your monitor right now you

936
01:06:46,424 --> 01:06:55,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, but I'm saying, you know, but also for people who have, you know, a really good HDTV, it's going to make a difference.

937
01:06:55,293 --> 01:06:59,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Like right now, the biggest thing is, now keep in mind, I also have an eye for it.

938
01:07:00,418 --> 01:07:01,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm seeing difference in color quality.

939
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm seeing difference in line quality and draw, you know.

940
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but how much of that can be blamed on the fact you're watching a streaming internet video?

941
01:07:07,584 --> 01:07:09,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why Final Fantasy XIII sucked.

942
01:07:10,245 --> 01:07:11,845
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Final Fantasy XIII's great.

943
01:07:13,086 --> 01:07:13,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

944
01:07:13,566 --> 01:07:16,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great game, and it's... I don't understand all this hatred.

945
01:07:17,227 --> 01:07:22,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I do understand why people are hating on it, but trust me, I've played way worse games this past year.

946
01:07:22,168 --> 01:07:23,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIII doesn't even come close.

947
01:07:23,229 --> 01:07:24,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I'm not saying it's at all bad.

948
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,089
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be Final Fantasy XIV.

949
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:27,950
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, I... Yeah, yeah, seriously.

950
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:28,710
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know you're not.

951
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're not.

952
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:33,692
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but keep in mind, Dan and I did the same thing with the Saturn and the PlayStation versions of Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

953
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:34,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

954
01:07:35,479 --> 01:07:39,901
[SPEAKER_09]: We had the Saturn one and we listened to the two.

955
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:41,221
[SPEAKER_09]: We watched both of them.

956
01:07:41,562 --> 01:07:43,302
[SPEAKER_09]: The Saturn version had better 2D.

957
01:07:43,863 --> 01:07:44,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Shitty 3D.

958
01:07:45,003 --> 01:07:47,564
[SPEAKER_09]: The Saturn version had better sound quality.

959
01:07:48,184 --> 01:07:51,446
[SPEAKER_09]: The PlayStation version had better load times.

960
01:07:53,326 --> 01:07:55,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the kind that does this type of comparison.

961
01:07:55,447 --> 01:08:02,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to the story at hand, because I kind of feel like the 360 PS3 debate on Final Fantasy XIII is like nine months old now since the game came out.

962
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:03,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to the story at hand...

963
01:08:05,011 --> 01:08:31,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the sense people in Japan didn't buy this game because A. they didn't know for the longest time that it was coming out and most people bought it on Playstation 3 thinking it was never coming out on the 360 and B. you don't have close to that same adoption ratio you have here in the US in Japan you're talking 6 Playstation 3's for every 1 Xbox 360 that's not even close to the ratio here which is not the reverse but it's a lot closer to 1 to 1 than that

964
01:08:32,737 --> 01:08:40,684
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, though, I have to look at it this way, too, is that we're dealing with Sony, a Japan-based company, and we're dealing with Microsoft, a US-based company.

965
01:08:41,605 --> 01:08:46,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're going to know their markets a little bit better in their native area.

966
01:08:46,389 --> 01:08:47,530
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really my point.

967
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:49,953
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

968
01:09:06,574 --> 01:09:22,405
[SPEAKER_09]: and maybe they didn't want the same type of features that we do here so you start off with a less interested base and then you bring out a game however long after there's been another version out that's available to people who have the system so it's...

969
01:09:23,966 --> 01:09:26,849
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically, I don't know why they expected it to do well.

970
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:30,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, I was hoping Final Fantasy XIII doesn't suck.

971
01:09:30,732 --> 01:09:32,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I just bought it, but I haven't started it yet.

972
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:33,554
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't suck, by the way.

973
01:09:33,574 --> 01:09:33,935
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't suck.

974
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:34,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

975
01:09:34,715 --> 01:09:36,096
[SPEAKER_05]: For the Xbox 360?

976
01:09:36,176 --> 01:09:36,917
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't suck.

977
01:09:37,057 --> 01:09:38,158
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just better on PS3.

978
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:39,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take your word for it.

979
01:09:39,639 --> 01:09:42,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't even think it's negligible.

980
01:09:43,022 --> 01:09:44,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you would notice a difference.

981
01:09:44,623 --> 01:09:44,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

982
01:09:44,844 --> 01:09:46,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, what's the difference, honestly?

983
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:49,628
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to disk swap on the 360 version.

984
01:09:51,624 --> 01:09:52,064
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

985
01:09:52,084 --> 01:09:53,926
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to do that on the PlayStation 2.

986
01:09:54,467 --> 01:09:55,147
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of TV?

987
01:09:55,187 --> 01:09:56,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have an HDTV that you play on?

988
01:09:56,849 --> 01:09:57,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

989
01:09:57,289 --> 01:09:59,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Samsung.

990
01:09:59,351 --> 01:10:00,432
[SPEAKER_04]: You might notice a little bit.

991
01:10:00,712 --> 01:10:01,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it 1080?

992
01:10:01,293 --> 01:10:01,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Full 1080?

993
01:10:01,933 --> 01:10:02,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it only 720?

994
01:10:02,774 --> 01:10:03,134
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 1080.

995
01:10:04,135 --> 01:10:07,118
[SPEAKER_04]: You might notice the hair is a little different.

996
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,460
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an LED.

997
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, the big things you're going to notice is difference in color.

998
01:10:13,103 --> 01:10:16,286
[SPEAKER_09]: You won't notice any difference if you never see the PS3 version.

999
01:10:16,447 --> 01:10:17,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put it that way.

1000
01:10:17,888 --> 01:10:26,756
[SPEAKER_09]: But the big difference is that you're dealing with more jaggedies on more aliasing on the Xbox 360 version because the graphics processor is different.

1001
01:10:26,776 --> 01:10:27,877
[SPEAKER_09]: The game was made for the PS3.

1002
01:10:28,618 --> 01:10:29,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1003
01:10:47,608 --> 01:10:49,310
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1004
01:11:08,022 --> 01:11:10,603
[SPEAKER_03]: January, I mean, come on, it's not a big old release month.

1005
01:11:11,864 --> 01:11:15,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Some cool stuff, though, coming out maybe a couple weeks, but not so much this week.

1006
01:11:16,086 --> 01:11:24,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Lost in Shadow, though, on the Wii is making its way out, so that puzzle game from Hudson Soft kind of has a little bit of a Shadow of the Colossus vibe to it.

1007
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:25,731
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be on the Wii.

1008
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:33,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the Osborne House, that's on Nintendo DS.

1009
01:11:34,075 --> 01:11:35,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, you get to go to the Osborne's house?

1010
01:11:35,776 --> 01:11:36,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1011
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:37,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1012
01:11:37,357 --> 01:11:38,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharon!

1013
01:11:39,939 --> 01:11:41,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that Osborn house, I'm afraid.

1014
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:42,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boring.

1015
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:44,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Emergency 2012.

1016
01:11:48,045 --> 01:11:52,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming that you play some sort of emergency crew when the world is ending.

1017
01:11:52,868 --> 01:11:55,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, that looks about right, actually, so that's kind of cool.

1018
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:58,572
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, warning, the world as we know it is out of control.

1019
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:05,798
[SPEAKER_03]: As the head of all rescue operations, you must ensure to get the job done with fire and rescue services.

1020
01:12:06,518 --> 01:12:10,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think fire and rescue services are going to stop a tidal wave from wiping out a city.

1021
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:12,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that really works.

1022
01:12:13,065 --> 01:12:13,645
[SPEAKER_03]: But they'll try.

1023
01:12:13,985 --> 01:12:14,966
[SPEAKER_03]: They will try.

1024
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:18,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold back that wave with your axe there.

1025
01:12:20,231 --> 01:12:24,976
[SPEAKER_03]: And then apparently Ghost Trick Phantom Detective is supposed to be out as well on Nintendo DS.

1026
01:12:25,516 --> 01:12:26,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is it.

1027
01:12:26,894 --> 01:12:28,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Traveling over to Japan this week.

1028
01:12:30,177 --> 01:12:36,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Not this week, but next week is when you start to see some stuff on the 360 like Arcana Heart 3, but I guess I'll reiterate that next week.

1029
01:12:37,184 --> 01:12:38,365
[SPEAKER_04]: So really nothing this week on the 360.

1030
01:12:39,065 --> 01:12:41,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Going over to the PlayStation 3, kind of the same story.

1031
01:12:41,808 --> 01:12:43,269
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not really a lot out there either.

1032
01:12:43,329 --> 01:12:46,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting the sense it's going to be a very slow week.

1033
01:12:47,794 --> 01:12:49,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Wii, you don't even see anything until the end of the month.

1034
01:12:50,056 --> 01:12:50,977
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the crazy stuff.

1035
01:12:51,497 --> 01:12:54,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Saga 3, Jiku no Hasa, Shadow or Light Saga 3, Jiku no Hasa, Shadow or Light

1036
01:13:10,576 --> 01:13:11,477
[SPEAKER_04]: A slot machine game you said?

1037
01:13:11,497 --> 01:13:11,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1038
01:13:11,617 --> 01:13:11,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1039
01:13:37,571 --> 01:13:41,272
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that would actually do really well over here to get into with the elderly market.

1040
01:13:42,632 --> 01:13:43,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I talk about Europe now?

1041
01:13:44,033 --> 01:13:44,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you can.

1042
01:13:45,273 --> 01:13:49,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, on the first, there was UFC Trainer.

1043
01:13:49,194 --> 01:13:51,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, no one really gives a crap about that.

1044
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:53,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the fourth, Lost in Shadow.

1045
01:13:53,116 --> 01:13:53,696
[SPEAKER_09]: And guess what?

1046
01:13:53,956 --> 01:13:54,456
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1047
01:13:55,656 --> 01:13:56,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Very slow week.

1048
01:13:56,516 --> 01:14:00,118
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the holiday shopping fever is gone, so it kind of makes sense.

1049
01:14:00,138 --> 01:14:00,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez, people.

1050
01:14:01,358 --> 01:14:03,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides, in two weeks, we got two great games on the PS3.

1051
01:14:04,259 --> 01:14:05,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that ironic?

1052
01:14:06,795 --> 01:14:10,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, we've got a couple more stories for you guys in the Classic Game of the Week.

1053
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,781
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll close out Part A in just a moment.

1054
01:14:13,038 --> 01:14:22,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, one of the bitches that we had last year with Ubisoft was their really odd use of DRM.

1055
01:14:22,986 --> 01:14:41,042
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a... Basically, you had to be connected to their servers the entire time while you're playing different games, and if for whatever reason you had some sort of connection problem, whether it be just a quick disconnect, your game would actually stop.

1056
01:14:41,862 --> 01:14:44,084
[SPEAKER_03]: and you would have no opportunity to save or whatever.

1057
01:14:44,824 --> 01:14:46,165
[SPEAKER_03]: It would just totally fuck you up.

1058
01:14:46,185 --> 01:14:50,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was on even single player games like Assassin's Creed 2 or Splinter Cell Conviction.

1059
01:14:51,848 --> 01:15:01,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently though, there has been an update, I guess, that those DRM checks are a little bit easier now.

1060
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:07,397
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, on games like Assassin's Creed 2 and Splinter Cell Conviction, for example...

1061
01:15:07,857 --> 01:15:08,638
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1062
01:15:26,801 --> 01:15:28,562
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't want to deal with it, they won't.

1063
01:15:28,742 --> 01:15:29,922
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the reality.

1064
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:35,004
[SPEAKER_03]: They got around it anyways, and all it really hurt was the people that bought the game originally.

1065
01:15:37,986 --> 01:15:40,847
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least it's not as terrible.

1066
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:43,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1067
01:15:44,764 --> 01:15:45,945
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1068
01:16:04,386 --> 01:16:07,749
[SPEAKER_04]: ViaCom and MTV Networks have been an amazing home for the past four years.

1069
01:16:07,769 --> 01:16:09,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, blah, blah, fluff, fluff, fluff, right?

1070
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:13,113
[SPEAKER_04]: It's where we launched Rock Band and Dance Central, Beatles, Green Day, blah, blah, blah.

1071
01:16:13,473 --> 01:16:18,357
[SPEAKER_04]: We're excited to be returning to our roots as an independent and privately owned studio.

1072
01:16:18,878 --> 01:16:22,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And what this means, the DLC schedule marches on for Rock Band.

1073
01:16:22,741 --> 01:16:28,926
[SPEAKER_04]: We will continue our support of previously released titles, and we're hard at work at some unannounced projects that we think you're going to be pumped about.

1074
01:16:29,546 --> 01:16:53,179
[SPEAKER_04]: and the other half of this it wasn't in the press release but it was confirmed they are keeping the licenses for Dance Central and Rock Band they will get to if they decide to make Rock Band 4 or Dance Central 2 I think at least one of those is a sure thing I would honestly say I don't think Rock Band 4 is a sure thing at this point I think Harmonix might do something new with the whole plastic instrument thing but they may not call it Rock Band

1075
01:16:54,423 --> 01:17:21,415
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think that's okay I think sometimes your series needs a swift kick in the pants so I would be quite okay with that I'd be okay with Dance Central 2 I would be totally okay with Dance Central 2 and I think that's a sure thing of course there's going to be a Dance Central 2 absolutely it was clearly the biggest game on Kinect I'm so happy we took down the tree today the Christmas tree so that we were able to move the coffee table out from the middle of the room again so now I have Kinect space again hooray congratulations there you go

1076
01:17:21,895 --> 01:17:24,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is, Harmonix going independent.

1077
01:17:24,498 --> 01:17:30,343
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of an obvious resolution that none of us had guessed previously.

1078
01:17:30,904 --> 01:17:42,374
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of think, oh, when people are talking about selling a company, it's like you never really think that, hey, they could just buy themselves because they probably have a lot of money, right?

1079
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good luck to Harmonix.

1080
01:17:44,496 --> 01:17:46,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping it'll pay off for them.

1081
01:17:46,618 --> 01:17:46,919
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1082
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:57,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's take a minute not to talk about the future or this year, the coming year, but to reflect on the past and gaming's history and how we all got here to 2011 in gaming.

1083
01:17:57,490 --> 01:17:59,432
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

1084
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:01,204
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1085
01:18:17,819 --> 01:18:18,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Hard Drivin'.

1086
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,180
[SPEAKER_09]: As in the nap machine.

1087
01:18:22,181 --> 01:18:23,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I will go into why it's the nap machine later.

1088
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:27,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So forget all this need for speed stuff.

1089
01:18:28,183 --> 01:18:30,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to those really great sound effects.

1090
01:18:30,764 --> 01:18:31,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Bong, bong.

1091
01:18:31,584 --> 01:18:32,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen for a minute.

1092
01:18:34,005 --> 01:18:36,226
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about as much music as the game has as a drum roll.

1093
01:18:39,327 --> 01:18:40,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Serious.

1094
01:18:40,027 --> 01:18:44,069
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll listen to some squeaking brakes as we listen to DarkSakura tell us about this game.

1095
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:52,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Hard Drivin' was basically, it was toted, according to this poster, as the world's first authentic driving simulation game.

1096
01:18:53,207 --> 01:18:57,191
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the first 3D polygon driving environment.

1097
01:18:57,271 --> 01:18:58,712
[SPEAKER_09]: It used a simulated cabinet.

1098
01:18:59,092 --> 01:19:02,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Virtual reality, oh my god, Lawnmower Man, it's real.

1099
01:19:02,815 --> 01:19:05,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was all on custom hardware.

1100
01:19:07,516 --> 01:19:17,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Force Feedback, Car Physics Simulator, and most of the design was done by some dude named Max Behensky, so that's pretty cool.

1101
01:19:19,026 --> 01:19:24,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, also keep in mind that other games that came out around this time, like Pole Position and Outrun, were sprite-based scaling.

1102
01:19:28,747 --> 01:19:29,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, you found the best part.

1103
01:19:30,328 --> 01:19:32,490
[SPEAKER_04]: The instant replay, trying to call up that loop.

1104
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:45,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, instead of having the sort of artificial graphics where the car wouldn't land the right, you know, right side up, or, you know, it actually used very realistic physics in the game.

1105
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:51,665
[SPEAKER_09]: When you went too far off track, you would crash, your skin, your skin, your windshield would crack.

1106
01:19:52,926 --> 01:19:57,570
[SPEAKER_09]: You could keep driving, and then it also gave you the replay where you would die.

1107
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:00,369
[SPEAKER_04]: and a hideous car fire.

1108
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:02,451
[SPEAKER_04]: But you gotta admit, some of it's a little janky.

1109
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:05,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the car explodes and then suddenly in the next frame it's back together.

1110
01:20:06,836 --> 01:20:07,797
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very jank.

1111
01:20:07,897 --> 01:20:10,600
[SPEAKER_04]: We are very spoiled by today's graphics.

1112
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind, this was 1988 and this was a Polygon game.

1113
01:20:14,104 --> 01:20:14,364
[SPEAKER_09]: In 1988.

1114
01:20:17,007 --> 01:20:19,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, car explosions do not work that way.

1115
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:20,306
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1116
01:20:40,918 --> 01:20:43,519
[SPEAKER_09]: It has, um, also you can play it in automatic.

1117
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:47,940
[SPEAKER_09]: You also have a realistic manual transmission with a clutch and everything.

1118
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,841
[SPEAKER_09]: You can stall the car when you miss shift.

1119
01:20:51,702 --> 01:20:54,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, like I said, force feedback and everything.

1120
01:20:54,162 --> 01:20:56,683
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's meant to be a driving simulator.

1121
01:20:57,423 --> 01:21:02,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, this game was pretty crazy for its time.

1122
01:21:02,945 --> 01:21:03,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1123
01:21:19,187 --> 01:21:47,287
[SPEAKER_09]: so as far as sequels that came out there was Race Driving in 1990, Hard Drivin' 2 Drive Harder that came out on the yeah, on the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga an unreleased one called Hard Drivin' Airborne in 1993 and then Street Drivin' that came out in 2001 on the GameCube, Playstation 2 and Xbox different versions came out Hard Drivin' 3, now it's hard

1124
01:21:50,069 --> 01:21:51,710
[SPEAKER_04]: HardDrivin4 in my pants.

1125
01:21:52,070 --> 01:22:03,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this that I'm going to quote on here is that the engine, transmission, control, suspension, and tire physics were modeled in conjunction with Doug Milliken, who was listed as a test driver in the game credits.

1126
01:22:04,459 --> 01:22:06,680
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's actually pretty cool.

1127
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:19,609
[SPEAKER_09]: It says that his father, William Milliken of Milliken Research, led a team at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in Buffalo, New York that converted aircraft equations of motion into equations of motion for the automobile.

1128
01:22:20,429 --> 01:22:25,153
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was a, you know, they actually used real science in it, which I thought was pretty cool.

1129
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:26,614
[SPEAKER_09]: It was meant to be a real simulator.

1130
01:22:28,771 --> 01:22:37,978
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as Easter eggs in the game, one of the buildings along the speed course has a sign above the door that says The Hut.

1131
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:49,247
[SPEAKER_09]: If you made a hard left turn at the start of the game, you have a secret track, which is a long straight road that leads to a very short circular track around a tower.

1132
01:22:49,987 --> 01:22:53,630
[SPEAKER_09]: If you slow down and stop in front of one of the buildings, a keyhole appears in the building door.

1133
01:22:53,950 --> 01:22:54,170
[SPEAKER_01]: What?! !

1134
01:22:55,431 --> 01:23:01,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Running into a cow will cause a moo sound to be played, at least in the Sega Genesis port there's exactly one cow.

1135
01:23:03,857 --> 01:23:04,518
[SPEAKER_09]: And carefully.

1136
01:23:05,358 --> 01:23:11,683
[SPEAKER_09]: After getting a sufficiently high score, then you get a full course race against the Phantom Photon on the stunt track.

1137
01:23:13,157 --> 01:23:13,777
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

1138
01:23:14,678 --> 01:23:22,641
[SPEAKER_09]: But now I have to tell you about... Now I'm going to put a picture of the cabinet in the chat room for a reason.

1139
01:23:23,141 --> 01:23:24,121
[SPEAKER_09]: For a specific reason.

1140
01:23:24,681 --> 01:23:27,843
[SPEAKER_09]: This thing had a chair that would swivel out.

1141
01:23:29,363 --> 01:23:31,584
[SPEAKER_09]: And inside it was very dark.

1142
01:23:32,144 --> 01:23:40,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So one day when I was working at Cyber Station at Bel Air Mall in Mobile, Alabama, there was nobody in the damn mall.

1143
01:23:41,107 --> 01:23:42,248
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Tuesday morning.

1144
01:23:42,941 --> 01:23:44,842
[SPEAKER_09]: I had been up all night, so guess what I did?

1145
01:23:46,163 --> 01:23:52,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I sat my happy butt inside the chair at hard driving, wheeled myself in, and I took a three-hour nap.

1146
01:23:54,928 --> 01:23:57,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, not like a full-on nap.

1147
01:23:57,629 --> 01:23:58,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I could still hear people.

1148
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:00,811
[SPEAKER_09]: No one came in.

1149
01:24:02,222 --> 01:24:03,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I got all my other stuff done.

1150
01:24:04,064 --> 01:24:06,487
[SPEAKER_09]: And I sat in the hard driving machine and took a three hour nap.

1151
01:24:07,569 --> 01:24:08,330
[SPEAKER_09]: It was dark.

1152
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,331
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair was comfortable.

1153
01:24:09,351 --> 01:24:11,513
[SPEAKER_04]: How colossally irresponsible of you, but funny.

1154
01:24:11,594 --> 01:24:12,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, please.

1155
01:24:13,196 --> 01:24:13,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I was 19.

1156
01:24:15,158 --> 01:24:20,224
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but at any rate, that's my story about the hard driving cabinet.

1157
01:24:20,464 --> 01:24:21,506
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the great nap machine.

1158
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:26,193
[SPEAKER_09]: The game actually, I'll be honest, I don't like playing Hard Drivin'.

1159
01:24:26,313 --> 01:24:27,013
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard.

1160
01:24:27,273 --> 01:24:29,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And time has not treated it well.

1161
01:24:29,674 --> 01:24:30,314
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it hasn't.

1162
01:24:31,135 --> 01:24:34,396
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's notable for what it is.

1163
01:24:34,716 --> 01:24:37,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta click on this link because there's a YouTube suggestion here.

1164
01:24:38,178 --> 01:24:41,199
[SPEAKER_04]: The worst Genesis game ever made, Hard Drivin'.

1165
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:44,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to remind myself how fucking terrible this is.

1166
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:46,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I don't want to hear some asshole talking about it.

1167
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:48,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to see it here.

1168
01:24:48,462 --> 01:24:52,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, with the crazy-ass drawing on the thing.

1169
01:24:52,844 --> 01:24:55,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, the frame rate on here is so awful.

1170
01:24:55,384 --> 01:24:56,665
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hideous, it's hideous.

1171
01:24:58,225 --> 01:25:03,727
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean... God, can you imagine that somebody somewhere actually dropped like $50 on this game?

1172
01:25:03,767 --> 01:25:04,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1173
01:25:04,368 --> 01:25:06,568
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one freaking track, right?

1174
01:25:06,748 --> 01:25:08,129
[SPEAKER_07]: You missed the cow, Rob!

1175
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:08,869
[SPEAKER_07]: You missed the cow!

1176
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:14,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm going to burn in hell for all eternity for missing the damn cow.

1177
01:25:14,565 --> 01:25:20,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Test Drive 3, and it came out around the same time, looked very similar to this.

1178
01:25:20,089 --> 01:25:22,830
[SPEAKER_03]: They came out after this.

1179
01:25:23,131 --> 01:25:23,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1180
01:25:23,711 --> 01:25:28,074
[SPEAKER_03]: You also have the race other cars, and I used to try to take a shortcut by driving off-road.

1181
01:25:29,055 --> 01:25:34,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Not something a performance high-speed vehicle is meant to do, but I did encounter lots of deer.

1182
01:25:35,259 --> 01:25:35,439
Deer.

1183
01:25:35,459 --> 01:25:35,559
Deer.

1184
01:25:36,195 --> 01:25:37,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob's looking at the Commodore 64 right now.

1185
01:25:37,876 --> 01:25:40,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Commodore 64 hard driving.

1186
01:25:40,358 --> 01:25:41,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to see this.

1187
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:42,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1188
01:25:42,979 --> 01:25:45,781
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like two colors.

1189
01:25:46,321 --> 01:25:48,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And this frame rate is awful.

1190
01:25:49,023 --> 01:25:49,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

1191
01:25:49,863 --> 01:25:53,465
[SPEAKER_04]: You could go old playing this game.

1192
01:25:53,566 --> 01:25:55,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I know this is terrible radio.

1193
01:25:55,086 --> 01:25:55,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Just link it in the chat room.

1194
01:25:56,007 --> 01:25:56,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine you're playing.

1195
01:25:57,008 --> 01:25:57,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll link it in the chat.

1196
01:25:57,708 --> 01:25:58,669
[SPEAKER_04]: But for those listening on the podcast.

1197
01:25:58,689 --> 01:25:59,529
[SPEAKER_04]: At least the screen breaks.

1198
01:25:59,769 --> 01:26:02,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine you're playing hard driving on the Game Boy.

1199
01:26:02,711 --> 01:26:04,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I worked in a video store when this game came out.

1200
01:26:04,212 --> 01:26:05,713
[SPEAKER_04]: It did pretty well in sales.

1201
01:26:29,907 --> 01:26:32,428
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's virtual reality, man.

1202
01:26:33,068 --> 01:26:33,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

1203
01:26:33,948 --> 01:26:35,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Wave of the future.

1204
01:26:37,629 --> 01:26:38,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something.

1205
01:26:38,389 --> 01:26:38,989
[SPEAKER_09]: At any rate.

1206
01:26:39,329 --> 01:26:39,889
[SPEAKER_09]: At any rate.

1207
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:44,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, I'm not a fan of the game itself.

1208
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:47,471
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I will give it... You're a big fan of naps.

1209
01:26:48,091 --> 01:26:48,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I love naps.

1210
01:26:50,711 --> 01:26:54,252
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will give it props for what it is and what it did at the time.

1211
01:26:55,592 --> 01:26:58,913
[SPEAKER_09]: If not for hard driving, we may not have Ridge Racer.

1212
01:27:00,312 --> 01:27:01,173
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1213
01:27:01,513 --> 01:27:05,435
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the beginning of our 3D racing games right here.

1214
01:27:06,616 --> 01:27:13,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though this game really hasn't been treated well with time and it's kind of shit now, without it, we wouldn't have some of the stuff we have today.

1215
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:17,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people like to do loopy loops and jumpy jumps.

1216
01:27:18,162 --> 01:27:21,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I just figured I took so many damn naps in the machine, I may as well play it a couple of times.

1217
01:27:22,945 --> 01:27:24,426
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you something else that's funny.

1218
01:27:25,106 --> 01:27:27,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk to other people who have worked in an arcade.

1219
01:27:28,408 --> 01:27:30,569
[SPEAKER_09]: We got an allotment of 25 tokens a week.

1220
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:35,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me, once you started working at the arcade, did you just stop using your damn tokens?

1221
01:27:35,171 --> 01:27:36,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you not play anything for a while?

1222
01:27:37,112 --> 01:27:38,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you were tired of being there.

1223
01:27:38,673 --> 01:27:42,695
[SPEAKER_09]: When I quit, Rob, seriously, I had 600 and something tokens.

1224
01:27:43,535 --> 01:27:44,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I played a lot of skeeball.

1225
01:27:45,436 --> 01:27:46,437
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of Street Fighter Alpha 2.

1226
01:27:47,737 --> 01:27:51,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Fifth dream in our chatroom says, VR without glasses.

1227
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:53,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Without glasses sound like anything recent?

1228
01:27:56,243 --> 01:27:56,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what you did there.

1229
01:27:57,804 --> 01:28:02,509
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that may be a very topical and appropriate game of the week, all things considered.

1230
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:05,191
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a lot crazier than you think.

1231
01:28:05,271 --> 01:28:07,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, there it is, a classic game of the week.

1232
01:28:07,613 --> 01:28:14,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard driving on various systems, but we're going to give it to the arcade because the arcade one can happen.

1233
01:28:14,199 --> 01:28:15,060
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I brought up.

1234
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:15,700
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1235
01:28:16,741 --> 01:28:18,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And definitely not the Commodore 64 version.

1236
01:28:18,803 --> 01:28:19,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely not that one.

1237
01:28:19,966 --> 01:28:22,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

1238
01:28:22,347 --> 01:28:23,007
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't go anywhere.

1239
01:28:23,027 --> 01:28:23,667
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not done.

1240
01:28:23,727 --> 01:28:25,148
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got plenty more show to go.

1241
01:28:25,228 --> 01:28:31,130
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about Chrono Trigger, Super Meat Boy, Valve, Indie Games, the 3DS.

1242
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:33,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, more, but we have some actual big news about it.

1243
01:28:33,371 --> 01:28:37,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to talk about all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1244
01:28:37,593 --> 01:28:38,153
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't go anywhere.

1245
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:44,131
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1246
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,488
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1247
01:29:26,249 --> 01:29:26,750
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1248
01:29:46,489 --> 01:30:05,275
[SPEAKER_04]: so check that out at our link in iTunes we don't really have a website yet working on it so search us in iTunes Horde House H-O-R-D-E space H-O-U-S-E or we are linked right there at OrangeLawnRadio.com we have a blog spot technically but that's just what we use to like link our feeds so we don't like don't take that too seriously

1249
01:30:06,215 --> 01:30:07,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's that.

1250
01:30:07,776 --> 01:30:10,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some quick news, some rapid news.

1251
01:30:10,897 --> 01:30:14,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it or not, there was still some stuff that happened in the gaming world this week.

1252
01:30:15,178 --> 01:30:15,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1253
01:30:15,738 --> 01:30:16,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, believe it or not.

1254
01:30:16,799 --> 01:30:17,339
[SPEAKER_03]: A few things.

1255
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:18,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Christmas doesn't stop everything.

1256
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:19,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not everything.

1257
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:27,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was announced this week that Pokemon Black and White will be headed over to North America on March 6th.

1258
01:30:28,383 --> 01:30:31,644
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to play with your Pokemans on that date.

1259
01:30:32,324 --> 01:30:34,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the two versions will

1260
01:30:34,565 --> 01:30:40,106
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have slightly different themes to them I guess this time.

1261
01:30:40,906 --> 01:30:58,750
[SPEAKER_03]: The black version will offer Pokemon looks like a Reshirium and a setting called Black City while white will contain a lush green area called White Forest and will let you capture a Pokemon named Zekrom.

1262
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:02,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, they're having to get creative with the alphabet soup on these Pokemon names, aren't they?

1263
01:31:02,731 --> 01:31:03,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemans!

1264
01:31:05,981 --> 01:31:13,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are actually going to be coming March 6th on the Nintendo DS.

1265
01:31:15,094 --> 01:31:20,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, not really coinciding with that, but next month...

1266
01:31:21,022 --> 01:31:27,627
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be some Pokemon downloads available at GameStop and Toys R Us.

1267
01:31:28,147 --> 01:31:34,051
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually happening between January 30th and February 5th at Toys R Us.

1268
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:44,077
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be able to pick up, I guess, Ash's Pikachu version of that character with a special set of abilities at Toys R Us.

1269
01:31:46,297 --> 01:31:48,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess he starts off at a level 50.

1270
01:31:50,198 --> 01:31:50,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, I guess.

1271
01:31:52,059 --> 01:31:59,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other stuff you can check out, of course, at GameStop during different weeks.

1272
01:31:59,961 --> 01:32:02,122
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have different Pokemon you can download.

1273
01:32:03,482 --> 01:32:06,083
[SPEAKER_03]: January 3rd through the 9th, they have Raikou.

1274
01:32:07,763 --> 01:32:36,029
[SPEAKER_03]: 17-23 Entei 31-6 Suicin That means nothing to me, by the way, because I don't play Pokemon, nor do I understand what any of these really flamboyant, slightly mythological creatures that almost looks like a dog

1275
01:32:37,372 --> 01:32:42,894
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to be the very best, like no one ever was, you gotta catch them all.

1276
01:32:45,095 --> 01:32:46,095
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like STDs.

1277
01:32:46,575 --> 01:32:47,916
[SPEAKER_03]: To train them is your cause.

1278
01:32:48,776 --> 01:32:49,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta catch them all.

1279
01:32:53,078 --> 01:32:59,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that I'm not sure a lot of people may be wanting to catch, but... Do you think antibiotics could clear up a bad case of the Pokemans?

1280
01:33:01,249 --> 01:33:07,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on a strong dose of antibiotics right now and I have no urge to play Pokemon.

1281
01:33:08,237 --> 01:33:09,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So, maybe.

1282
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:21,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Dynasty Warriors 7 is coming to North America March 22nd and it will be, I guess, the first version that will include 3D and move support, of course, on the PlayStation 3.

1283
01:33:23,633 --> 01:33:26,454
[SPEAKER_03]: and I guess the game will also be on Xbox 360 as well.

1284
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:29,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Some new stuff that's going to be in the game.

1285
01:33:29,615 --> 01:33:33,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently they have a free roam mode dubbed Chronicle Mode.

1286
01:33:34,056 --> 01:33:40,258
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be 60 playable characters and I believe online co-op is the other brand new thing.

1287
01:33:42,179 --> 01:34:05,509
[SPEAKER_03]: so yay and then last but not least as a lot of games seem to kind of go this route Devil Summoner Soul Hackers is a game that I guess came out in the Saturn back in Japan in 1997 it has not been released over here in North America or has gotten an English release anywhere in the world I remember that game

1288
01:34:06,337 --> 01:34:18,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So now, a group of hackers calling themselves Devil Hackers They're actually working on a fan-made translation of the title for the PSP

1289
01:34:20,777 --> 01:34:26,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, they have a teaser trailer for it, but it's like 13 minutes long.

1290
01:34:26,442 --> 01:34:27,804
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a big tease.

1291
01:34:27,824 --> 01:34:29,185
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a long trailer, geez.

1292
01:34:29,305 --> 01:34:30,206
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a long trailer.

1293
01:34:30,926 --> 01:34:31,567
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that game.

1294
01:34:32,007 --> 01:34:35,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do we really need to watch a trailer of like, hey, look, the game's in English now.

1295
01:34:35,931 --> 01:34:37,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

1296
01:34:38,433 --> 01:34:38,914
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1297
01:34:38,994 --> 01:34:43,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't heard about this game until tonight, so maybe some people just need to know about its epic epicness.

1298
01:34:45,371 --> 01:35:05,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, speaking of epic, Rock Band is a very epic music game and there's an epic musician coming to the game this week and it doesn't get any better than Johnny Cash, ladies and gentlemen, coming this week to Rock Band and it's a big pack of eight songs that you can get for about, what is that, 1080 Microsoft points?

1299
01:35:06,331 --> 01:35:08,232
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 14 bucks and all said and done.

1300
01:35:08,612 --> 01:35:09,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Cry, cry, cry.

1301
01:35:09,733 --> 01:35:11,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't take your guns to town.

1302
01:35:11,394 --> 01:35:12,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Five feet high and rising.

[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1310
01:35:21,619 --> 01:35:22,700
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a boy named Sue.

1311
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:25,121
[SPEAKER_01]: That has the best line in it.

1312
01:35:25,361 --> 01:35:27,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if that wasn't good enough, DarkSakura, get this.

1321
01:35:46,052 --> 01:35:47,332
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, you know what?

1322

[SPEAKER_04]: Free is free.

1323
01:35:48,252 --> 01:35:49,392

01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:50,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1325
01:35:51,253 --> 01:35:56,134

01:35:56,914 --> 01:35:58,855

01:35:58,975 --> 01:36:03,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Our friend has brought over the guitar, the pro guitar.

1329
01:36:03,156 --> 01:36:03,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah?

1330
01:36:03,416 --> 01:36:03,816
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you think?

01:36:04,336 --> 01:36:05,477
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1332
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:30,207
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like Rock Band 3 and you like Fallout 3, then this song is for you.

1333
01:36:30,347 --> 01:36:32,028
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the Rock Band Network.

1334
01:36:32,048 --> 01:36:33,549
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to dig for this one a little bit.

1335
01:36:34,229 --> 01:36:39,151
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Kirby Crackle doing the Fallout tribute song, Vault 101.

1336
01:36:39,451 --> 01:36:44,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a little play on where you start in the game Fallout 3.

1337
01:36:44,894 --> 01:36:48,675
[SPEAKER_04]: That's available on the Rock Band Network store, so if you like that song.

1338
01:36:49,256 --> 01:36:51,877
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a clip of it available on YouTube if you want to check it out.

1339
01:36:53,177 --> 01:36:56,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band isn't the only game getting some download stuff coming.

1340
01:36:56,819 --> 01:36:58,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Central is still kicking.

1341
01:36:58,899 --> 01:36:59,720
[SPEAKER_04]: It is still going.

1342
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,361
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, actually, it came out a couple weeks ago, but we were off for the holidays.

1343
01:37:04,562 --> 01:37:05,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1344
01:37:06,142 --> 01:37:08,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Rihanna came out with Disturbia.

1345
01:37:09,563 --> 01:37:11,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls and Boys by Blur.

1346
01:37:11,604 --> 01:37:12,285
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

1347
01:37:13,145 --> 01:37:14,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And Janet Jackson with Control.

1348
01:37:15,526 --> 01:37:15,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1349
01:37:17,286 --> 01:37:19,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you dance to Girls and Boys and Dance Central, Dark Sakura?

1350
01:37:19,987 --> 01:37:20,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you like your Blur.

1351
01:37:22,945 --> 01:37:23,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Meat Boy

1352
01:37:46,584 --> 01:37:47,304
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1353
01:38:11,018 --> 01:38:14,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, A, I think it was that Nintendo was really the first to announce it.

1354
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:17,561
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that they were designing specifically for the Wii to begin with.

1355
01:38:17,861 --> 01:38:19,922
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just making a game and Nintendo kind of wanted it.

1356
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:23,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And B, you know what?

1357
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:23,743
[SPEAKER_04]: The game grew bigger.

1358
01:38:25,084 --> 01:38:25,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a great game.

1359
01:38:26,604 --> 01:38:30,266
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you own a Wii, you probably have a PC somewhere in your house.

1360
01:38:30,846 --> 01:38:33,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you don't have a 360, at least you can get this game somewhere.

1361
01:38:33,587 --> 01:38:38,849
[SPEAKER_04]: The game will not be coming out on the PlayStation 3 due to an arrangement with Microsoft.

1362
01:38:39,009 --> 01:38:39,310
Hmm.

1363
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:42,531
[SPEAKER_04]: You can kind of read between the lines there.

1364
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:44,813
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1365
01:39:04,486 --> 01:39:14,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we have new characters for Tekken Tag Tournament 2 There's a Luchadora And they don't know her name But she's pink!

1366
01:39:15,293 --> 01:39:24,459
[SPEAKER_09]: She's wearing a wrestling mask She makes me think of Rainbow Mika And it's a she Yeah So maybe they're taking a page from Capcom's book

1367
01:39:26,073 --> 01:39:42,105
[SPEAKER_09]: and then in other news there's actually a few more things that are sort of cementing in that the previously rumored Taskmaster Akuma and Sienko are going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and that's in the way of Xbox 360 achievements

1368
01:39:44,006 --> 01:39:53,216
[SPEAKER_09]: There is one called For Those Who Dwell in Darkness, and so that's going to be a team composed of all Darkstalkers characters, so that means three characters.

1369
01:39:54,117 --> 01:39:56,759
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's going to be another Darkstalker.

1370
01:39:56,939 --> 01:40:01,584
[SPEAKER_09]: So far we just have Felicia and Morrigan, so all the rumors are going to Sienko.

1371
01:40:02,025 --> 01:40:06,489
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's one called Fate of the Satsui no Hado, which is going to be...

1372
01:40:09,173 --> 01:40:12,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, the only other person that Ryu could fight would be Akuma.

1373
01:40:12,654 --> 01:40:16,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's the only person in game canon that would have that going on.

1374
01:40:17,055 --> 01:40:18,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you count Marvel superheroes.

1375
01:40:18,976 --> 01:40:22,656
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the guy that's from Super Street Fighter 4?

1376
01:40:22,716 --> 01:40:27,418
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that was... What was it?

1377
01:40:28,578 --> 01:40:29,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Shenlong or whatever.

1378
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:31,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Gokent.

1379
01:40:33,411 --> 01:40:34,513
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Goken.

1380
01:40:34,553 --> 01:40:36,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it was another character.

1381
01:40:36,716 --> 01:40:38,438
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't Akuma or whatever.

1382
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:40,581
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to be their... Yeah, Goken.

1383
01:40:40,842 --> 01:40:41,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1384
01:40:41,503 --> 01:40:42,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Their sensei, that's Goken.

1385
01:40:42,905 --> 01:40:45,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and he doesn't follow that.

1386
01:40:46,450 --> 01:40:46,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1387
01:40:47,742 --> 01:40:49,563
[SPEAKER_09]: because he's hardcore badass and has cool music.

1388
01:40:50,324 --> 01:40:55,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other one, of course, the rumor is Taskmaster, who I'm like, dude, he's not even relevant.

1389
01:40:55,707 --> 01:40:56,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Why put him in it?

1390
01:40:56,488 --> 01:41:03,993
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess, but there's supposed to be more going on with that one.

1391
01:41:04,773 --> 01:41:08,056
[SPEAKER_09]: They also said there's another list of achievements.

1392
01:41:08,156 --> 01:41:09,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Among those are who will answer the call.

1393
01:41:10,637 --> 01:41:15,481
[SPEAKER_09]: And this achievement is participate in eight player lobby on Xbox Live.

1394
01:41:15,561 --> 01:41:17,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's going to be lobbies.

1395
01:41:19,522 --> 01:41:24,423
[SPEAKER_09]: So we also get the Sentinel and Hagar are also rumored to be in it.

1396
01:41:25,083 --> 01:41:27,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just happy that X-23 is in it.

1397
01:41:29,444 --> 01:41:30,424
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1398
01:41:30,444 --> 01:41:32,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a definite purchase for you then, DarkSakura.

1399
01:41:33,405 --> 01:41:34,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah!

1400
01:41:34,445 --> 01:41:35,425
[SPEAKER_04]: The minute it was announced.

1401
01:41:35,565 --> 01:41:39,186
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't even matter what characters are in it.

1402
01:41:39,246 --> 01:41:42,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I am sick of Deadpool in the comics, but I love everything else that has Deadpool in it.

1403
01:41:42,667 --> 01:41:43,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that make sense?

1404
01:41:44,247 --> 01:41:44,347
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1405
01:41:44,795 --> 01:41:45,176
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

1406
01:41:45,537 --> 01:41:47,221
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get to the Twitters.

1407
01:41:48,043 --> 01:41:49,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1408
01:41:49,386 --> 01:41:54,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we ask you to show us your tweets, and we will respond to them here on the program.

1409
01:41:55,762 --> 01:42:00,243
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start tonight with a tweet from Nathan Jackson on Twitter.

1410
01:42:00,383 --> 01:42:01,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Question for OLR.

1411
01:42:01,924 --> 01:42:07,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the Kinect going to fundamentally change gaming to the point of abandoning controllers completely?

1412
01:42:08,306 --> 01:42:10,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give that a big fat no.

1413
01:42:11,207 --> 01:42:13,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Because some people like to touch things.

1414
01:42:13,968 --> 01:42:14,628
[SPEAKER_04]: They like that.

1415
01:42:15,008 --> 01:42:21,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And funny enough, I think that's all kind of part of Sony's marketing campaign is that sometimes people want tangible things.

1416
01:42:22,571 --> 01:42:22,751
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

1417
01:42:24,031 --> 01:42:25,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's case in point.

1418
01:42:26,253 --> 01:42:33,918
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only so much of the iPhone gaming I can take because I don't have those tangible buttons and the responsiveness isn't always there for me.

1419
01:42:33,938 --> 01:42:39,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they seriously need to... Aren't they supposed to be unveiling new stuff soon or something?

1420
01:42:39,943 --> 01:42:42,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Macworld's coming up this month.

1421
01:42:42,685 --> 01:42:48,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, they seriously need some sort of controller thing or something because it would really help.

1422
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:52,101
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, will it change gaming?

1423
01:42:52,362 --> 01:42:52,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1424
01:42:52,982 --> 01:42:56,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this type of technology has been slowly coming at us ever since the Wii.

1425
01:42:56,884 --> 01:43:01,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what you're seeing with the Kinect is really just an evolution of something we've kind of seen before.

1426
01:43:02,327 --> 01:43:03,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will evolve again.

1427
01:43:04,008 --> 01:43:08,170
[SPEAKER_04]: So is the Kinect here to stay in gaming culture?

1428
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:08,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1429
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:12,312
[SPEAKER_04]: But is it going to eliminate what you know of games today?

1430
01:43:12,712 --> 01:43:12,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah.

1431
01:43:13,453 --> 01:43:14,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Not until we have the holodeck.

1432
01:43:14,793 --> 01:43:15,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Once the holodeck's here...

1433
01:43:16,516 --> 01:43:17,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it's all over.

1434
01:43:17,276 --> 01:43:25,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Because remember, and I've said this on the show a lot, everything we do with every generation is bringing us one step closer to the holodeck for reals.

1435
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:30,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Once gaming reaches the holodeck, we're on the last generation of gaming.

1436
01:43:32,462 --> 01:43:33,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Even then, there might be a holodeck 2.0, huh?

1437
01:43:33,923 --> 01:43:35,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1438
01:43:35,764 --> 01:43:36,984
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see.

1439
01:43:37,004 --> 01:43:38,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on with some other tweets.

1440
01:43:39,705 --> 01:43:40,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to...

1441
01:43:42,816 --> 01:43:44,678
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S sends us a tweet.

1442
01:43:45,578 --> 01:43:46,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1443
01:43:46,039 --> 01:43:53,245
[SPEAKER_04]: EA is being sued by gamers because of the football license exclusivity that they have.

1444
01:43:53,285 --> 01:43:55,867
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the story that he's linking us to.

1445
01:43:56,487 --> 01:43:58,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I heard about this before.

1446
01:43:59,790 --> 01:44:26,832
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe something has progressed with this I could have sworn I heard something about this before but it was like years ago but anyway whatever let's see they're saying we believe EA forced consumers to pay an artificial premium on Madden NFL video games we intend to prove that EA could inflate prices on their sports titles because these exclusive licenses restrain trade and competition for interactive sports software because you know when NFL 2K5 came out it was only 20 bucks

1447
01:44:28,053 --> 01:44:54,283
[SPEAKER_04]: and EA had to sell Madden 2005 at $30 and then once the exclusive deal hit, well shit, those games have just cost like $60 since then they want anybody who's purchased an EA football game since August 2005 to get damages in this settlement, which if it ends up being this whole class action thing means every person will probably get $0.50 hope you retained all your proof of purchases for these 5 year old games good luck

1448
01:44:55,902 --> 01:44:57,863
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, yeah, I knew this was old.

1449
01:44:57,923 --> 01:44:59,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It was originally filed in mid-2008.

1450
01:45:00,964 --> 01:45:05,985
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's new about it, a judge has recently allowed this lawsuit to proceed.

1451
01:45:06,826 --> 01:45:08,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I'd heard about this before.

1452
01:45:08,326 --> 01:45:09,527
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just that long ago.

1453
01:45:10,207 --> 01:45:11,187
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's moving forward.

1454
01:45:11,207 --> 01:45:13,748
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't laughed out of court, so that could be interesting.

1455
01:45:16,109 --> 01:45:22,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Story for us from TigerClaw305 about the Galaga world record attempt.

1456
01:45:24,505 --> 01:45:34,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Andrew Laidlaw of Washington State has claimed the Galaga record and he did it on New Year's Day.

1457
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:42,657
[SPEAKER_04]: 4,525,150 points as certified by Twin Galaxies because you know, they carry the spirit stick and what they say goes.

1458
01:45:42,797 --> 01:45:44,959
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are the authority on video game high scores.

1459
01:45:45,559 --> 01:45:52,746
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a record taken from Phil Day, who set a 3.2 million record in November of 2009.

1460
01:45:54,067 --> 01:45:58,511
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, quote, the first time was magical in a way, this time it's a huge relief.

1461
01:45:59,292 --> 01:46:00,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, congratulations.

1462
01:46:00,613 --> 01:46:03,136
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot can be said about sex that way.

1463
01:46:04,696 --> 01:46:08,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I was gonna say, you know, ability to perform under stress.

1464
01:46:08,801 --> 01:46:10,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1465
01:46:10,603 --> 01:46:11,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you crazy kids.

1466
01:46:11,965 --> 01:46:13,307
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gonna do it for the tweeters tonight.

1467
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:16,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Tyra Claw linked us another story, but it's coming up a little later in the show.

1468
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:22,158
[SPEAKER_04]: And also Spazinator is not enjoying the changes to the feed because he's not able to tune in.

1469
01:46:22,558 --> 01:46:26,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember guys, allgames.com is really the best place for you to tune in.

1470
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:27,741
[SPEAKER_04]: It is HTML5 compliant.

1471
01:46:27,781 --> 01:46:30,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the only people that are getting screwed are the PSP people.

1472
01:46:30,522 --> 01:46:33,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm not sure the PSP browser supports the HTML5.

1473
01:46:33,644 --> 01:46:36,665
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully there will be a solution for you guys soon.

1474
01:46:37,005 --> 01:46:40,087
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there's a lot of change-a-roonies going around at All Games Radio.

1475
01:46:40,747 --> 01:47:02,878
[SPEAKER_04]: from what I understand not bad stuff just you know kind of new year new stuff out with the old in with the new so some of the shows that are no longer around they're going to be replaced with some new live shows so you know nice to have some new stuff going on so with that comes streaming changes etc etc so hopefully they get all that worked out in the next couple weeks and then we can update all our fun little PSP stuffs and get everybody back on board

1476
01:47:03,618 --> 01:47:05,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news.

1477
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:07,182
[SPEAKER_04]: The mailbag is coming up in a little bit.

1478
01:47:07,222 --> 01:47:10,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, FUs of the Week, and of course the Skype line.

1479
01:47:11,025 --> 01:47:11,926
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, some more news.

1480
01:47:13,167 --> 01:47:13,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

1481
01:47:14,246 --> 01:47:15,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff.

1482
01:47:16,508 --> 01:47:19,190
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of neat.

1483
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:23,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Valve is pretty kind of on the cutting edge with different things.

1484
01:47:24,253 --> 01:47:25,974
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely put out a lot of popular games.

1485
01:47:26,335 --> 01:47:35,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, one of the things that they actually have interest in doing is providing better experiences for those who may be disabled.

1486
01:47:36,081 --> 01:47:40,525
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, one of the things that they're looking to do is with eye tracking.

1487
01:47:41,105 --> 01:47:42,006
[SPEAKER_03]: This would provide...

1488
01:47:42,566 --> 01:47:56,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Ways for people that, for example, don't have full body movement to be able to play without having to use their hands or their entire body as an input device.

1489
01:47:57,054 --> 01:48:05,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says, it may be possible in the future to let the eyes act as the proxy for the mouse cursor, letting gamers transmit navigation data.

1490
01:48:05,659 --> 01:48:07,800
[SPEAKER_03]: and targeting inputs via eye movements.

1491
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:19,126
[SPEAKER_03]: If you couple this with the use of blinks and other proxies for button presses, you may remove the need for a mouse and keyboard or gamepad altogether.

1492
01:48:20,386 --> 01:48:21,287
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

1493
01:48:24,085 --> 01:48:25,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So, break this down for me.

1494
01:48:25,586 --> 01:48:27,227
[SPEAKER_04]: How exactly is that going to work?

1495
01:48:28,388 --> 01:48:32,271
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have some sort of way to track where your eyes are looking.

1496
01:48:33,052 --> 01:48:43,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, they're going to have some sort of system in place where, for example, like say, if I blink my eyes a certain way or something, like a double blink or something like that, that it will...

1497
01:48:43,820 --> 01:48:44,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Steven Hawking Games

1498
01:49:00,687 --> 01:49:05,229
[SPEAKER_09]: But wasn't it... I want to say it's Atari, but I'm not 100% certain.

1499
01:49:05,249 --> 01:49:07,049
[SPEAKER_09]: It had this thing called a psychic controller.

1500
01:49:07,509 --> 01:49:10,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, all it did was control... The mind... Thingy.

1501
01:49:11,391 --> 01:49:12,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the name of it.

1502
01:49:12,451 --> 01:49:13,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody in chat will yell it out.

1503
01:49:13,731 --> 01:49:19,493
[SPEAKER_09]: But it really just used the movement of the forehead and blinking of the eyes to do the control.

1504
01:49:20,173 --> 01:49:24,855
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same concept, but now that the technology has caught up that it could actually be...

1505
01:49:25,775 --> 01:49:29,378
[SPEAKER_04]: or track your retinas like, you know, an ultra fine connect.

1506
01:49:29,658 --> 01:49:30,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, certainly.

1507
01:49:30,959 --> 01:49:34,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think that the technology has come up well enough to make it something viable now.

1508
01:49:36,723 --> 01:49:39,025
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'd hate to have that with somebody with epilepsy.

1509
01:49:40,466 --> 01:49:41,227
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that wouldn't work.

1510
01:49:42,167 --> 01:49:43,428
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a neat concept.

1511
01:49:44,009 --> 01:49:52,755
[SPEAKER_09]: And especially though, with, well, I was thinking, you know, there's other uses for head tracking out there, but that's really, I think, innovative.

1512
01:49:52,975 --> 01:49:53,956
[SPEAKER_09]: A good, a good thought.

1513
01:49:55,866 --> 01:49:57,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all about making games more accessible.

1514
01:49:58,309 --> 01:50:03,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this stuff could ever replace, but if it helps enable and bring more people to the table, then hooray.

1515
01:50:04,274 --> 01:50:05,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Then maybe people won't sue.

1516
01:50:07,137 --> 01:50:07,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know.

1517
01:50:08,378 --> 01:50:09,899
[SPEAKER_09]: People will sue about what they can sue.

1518
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:10,880
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1519
01:50:11,621 --> 01:50:19,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, oh, Ranma says in our chatroom at chat.orangelandre.com, I'm reminded of those special custom controllers Nintendo put out for disabled people to play their games.

1520
01:50:21,410 --> 01:50:21,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1521
01:50:24,045 --> 01:50:24,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Chrono Trigger

1522
01:50:40,225 --> 01:50:40,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.

1523
01:50:40,846 --> 01:50:46,309
[SPEAKER_04]: The old school Super Nintendo game is apparently coming back all over again.

1524
01:50:46,389 --> 01:50:46,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Sit down.

1525
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:51,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a sequel, but it's the inevitable mobile version of the game.

1526
01:50:52,073 --> 01:50:56,696
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a teaser site up now on Squeenix's Japanese website.

1527
01:50:57,216 --> 01:50:58,457
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1528
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:27,702
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably will inevitably come out for the iPhone.

1529
01:51:29,143 --> 01:51:30,464
[SPEAKER_04]: That was wordy, wasn't it?

1530
01:51:30,524 --> 01:51:31,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably will inevitably, whatever.

1531
01:51:32,646 --> 01:51:34,407
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably going to come out for the iPhone at some point.

1532
01:51:34,427 --> 01:51:35,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't want to guarantee it because I don't know anything.

1533
01:51:36,409 --> 01:51:38,531
[SPEAKER_04]: But, hey, Secret of Mana just came out on the iPhone.

1534
01:51:38,571 --> 01:51:38,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know that?

1535
01:51:38,971 --> 01:51:39,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And the iPad?

1536
01:51:40,012 --> 01:51:41,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like the way it controls, but that's just me.

1537
01:51:41,853 --> 01:51:45,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course, because the controls on the iPhone suck.

1538
01:51:45,897 --> 01:51:46,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1539
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:46,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1540
01:51:46,317 --> 01:51:46,898
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1541
01:52:08,817 --> 01:52:10,179
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1542
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:51,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Amiga777 in our chatroom says hope they don't abandon like they did for Agito oh that's right the Final Fantasy 13 remember that well keep in mind Amiga we haven't heard anything about Versus either so it could still be happening just later this year I have a feeling Final Fantasy 13 Versus is going to be the big thing we hear about at E3 this year from Squeenix at least in the JRPG camp because certainly they have the Tomb Raider reboot now isn't that weird that the Tomb Raider reboot is a Squeenix game now can we talk about this but

1543
01:52:52,515 --> 01:52:53,656
[SPEAKER_04]: All the different camps there.

1544
01:52:54,237 --> 01:52:59,142
[SPEAKER_04]: SalaciousPop in our chatroom says, they'll charge $9 for the ROM just like Secret of Mana for iOS.

1545
01:53:00,163 --> 01:53:01,364
[SPEAKER_04]: $9 for an iOS ROM hack.

1546
01:53:02,045 --> 01:53:04,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hold on.

1547
01:53:04,087 --> 01:53:06,710
[SPEAKER_04]: You could kind of read into that a couple ways.

1548
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:10,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't think it's really a ROM hack, but...

1549
01:53:10,874 --> 01:53:16,462
[SPEAKER_04]: because they do have to adapt it for a different screen resolution, and they are putting those controls in it.

1550
01:53:16,482 --> 01:53:18,805
[SPEAKER_04]: $9 is still a lot, though.

1551
01:53:18,885 --> 01:53:20,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I hear you there.

1552
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:24,233
[SPEAKER_04]: But those games will inevitably come down in price.

1553
01:53:24,453 --> 01:53:25,795
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be $9 this month, $7 next month.

1554
01:53:28,137 --> 01:53:55,951
[SPEAKER_04]: 99 cents when there's a big sale and that's when I will finally get it at some point and I urge you to do the same thing Savalas in our chatroom says Angry Birds is amazing on iPhone, iPad, iTouch you know I still haven't played that game I've heard very mixed things on Angry Birds Angry Birds is frustrating and fun I've had it downloaded forever and I still have not played it and then like they taunt you with their little snort noises stupid green pigs

1555
01:53:57,355 --> 01:53:58,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I played some iPhone games.

1556
01:53:58,996 --> 01:54:00,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I played that Smurf Village game, finally.

1557
01:54:01,378 --> 01:54:05,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And I played that dungeon crawler game that Loki gifted me a couple weeks ago.

1558
01:54:05,641 --> 01:54:08,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really pretty, but it was kind of hard to control.

1559
01:54:11,525 --> 01:54:12,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, it's still really pretty.

1560
01:54:13,647 --> 01:54:15,048
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably better on the iPad.

1561
01:54:15,148 --> 01:54:15,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1562
01:54:15,448 --> 01:54:17,830
[SPEAKER_04]: For some reason, you're so cramped on the phone.

1563
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:20,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think on the iPad, you might have a little bit better...

1564
01:54:20,876 --> 01:54:26,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I forgot to mention, they have Raptor Call of the Shadows on iOS now.

1565
01:54:27,062 --> 01:54:27,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

1566
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:28,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that old shareware game?

1567
01:54:29,224 --> 01:54:29,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

1568
01:54:30,745 --> 01:54:31,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1569
01:54:31,946 --> 01:54:32,767
[SPEAKER_04]: How much do they want for that?

1570
01:54:34,268 --> 01:54:34,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't know.

1571
01:54:36,751 --> 01:54:37,031
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1572
01:54:38,072 --> 01:54:39,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on, DarkSakura.

1573
01:54:40,134 --> 01:54:40,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Meat!

1574
01:54:42,136 --> 01:54:43,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaty meat meat.

1575
01:54:44,978 --> 01:54:45,719
[SPEAKER_04]: You're making me hungry.

1576
01:54:47,656 --> 01:54:50,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Super Meat Boy is going to have some goodies coming out.

1577
01:54:50,437 --> 01:54:51,437
[SPEAKER_09]: More beefy goodness.

1578
01:54:52,757 --> 01:54:53,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Mmm, meat.

1579
01:54:55,898 --> 01:55:10,741
[SPEAKER_09]: With the next update, and it's supposed to be a free PC update, there is going to be a level editor, an online level portal called Super Meat World, and something called Enter the Unknown.

1580
01:55:11,301 --> 01:55:15,102
[SPEAKER_09]: But with the editor, you can basically go...

1581
01:55:16,142 --> 01:55:16,623
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1582
01:55:39,844 --> 01:55:55,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Meat World is a big hub and it's what's gonna bring you new chapters to the game and it unlocks with 30 bandages and pops up on the map before the first chapter actually begins and

1583
01:55:56,062 --> 01:56:21,800
[SPEAKER_09]: and then enter the unknown which is exclusive for the PC picks a random user made level and filters it based by whatever difficulty that you picked so basically it just is giving you a random player created level based on the difficulty that you've selected so pretty cool that's pretty cool that's interesting that whole like random esque ability

1584
01:56:22,839 --> 01:56:23,740
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Mystery Meat.

1585
01:56:23,780 --> 01:56:25,401
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they should have called it was Mystery Meat.

1586
01:56:25,461 --> 01:56:26,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Mystery Meat.

1587
01:56:26,221 --> 01:56:26,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1588
01:56:26,822 --> 01:56:28,503
[SPEAKER_04]: We should trademark that today.

1589
01:56:30,104 --> 01:56:31,244
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds so wrong.

1590
01:56:31,925 --> 01:56:32,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Meat Boy.

1591
01:56:33,326 --> 01:56:36,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst title ever and worst.

1592
01:56:36,548 --> 01:56:38,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've said this a million times on the show.

1593
01:56:38,109 --> 01:56:41,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst little logo ever, but awesome game.

1594
01:56:41,831 --> 01:56:42,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Bandage Girl.

1595
01:56:42,672 --> 01:56:43,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Bandage Girl?

1596
01:56:43,512 --> 01:56:44,592
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to be kidding me.

1597
01:56:44,712 --> 01:56:48,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we never did an appropriate top games of the year.

1598
01:56:48,334 --> 01:56:49,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Fetus?

1599
01:56:49,274 --> 01:56:50,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1600
01:56:50,415 --> 01:56:53,656
[SPEAKER_04]: But Super Meat Boy definitely would have been near my top of the list.

1601
01:56:55,737 --> 01:56:57,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm showing Gary the beginning of the game.

1602
01:56:59,018 --> 01:57:00,839
[SPEAKER_05]: This is real?

1603
01:57:00,919 --> 01:57:01,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1604
01:57:02,099 --> 01:57:06,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, dare I ask if you had to pick one game for your game of the year last year?

1605
01:57:07,921 --> 01:57:08,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it possible?

1606
01:57:09,283 --> 01:57:09,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Dead?

1607
01:57:09,823 --> 01:57:10,885
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what everybody else picked.

1608
01:57:12,566 --> 01:57:13,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Dead was alright.

1609
01:57:13,788 --> 01:57:15,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1610
01:57:15,730 --> 01:57:17,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I still play Grand Theft Auto though.

1611
01:57:18,373 --> 01:57:19,474
[SPEAKER_03]: But Red Dead was kind of cool.

1612
01:57:19,835 --> 01:57:22,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I would say it's my game of the year though.

1613
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:24,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1614
01:57:26,162 --> 01:57:26,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't pick one.

1615
01:57:28,174 --> 01:57:30,395
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we didn't even try to do that episode.

1616
01:57:30,676 --> 01:57:31,916
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of great games last year.

1617
01:57:32,657 --> 01:57:33,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just took last week off.

1618
01:57:33,938 --> 01:57:34,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.

1619
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:40,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a top contender for Game of the Year this year is going to be... Well, what do you think?

1620
01:57:40,942 --> 01:57:43,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Earth Defense Force, Insect Overgeddon.

1621
01:57:44,224 --> 01:57:45,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1622
01:57:45,505 --> 01:57:52,430
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, last year, I'm pretty sure I would have said on the end of the year episode, Oh, man, Final Fantasy XIV is going to be the best game of the year next year.

1623
01:57:53,564 --> 01:57:54,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, was I wrong!

1624
01:57:55,685 --> 01:57:58,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still going to say Star Trek Online was my game of the year.

1625
01:58:00,349 --> 01:58:02,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, it was the game that only lasted me a year.

1626
01:58:04,051 --> 01:58:11,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine was probably Civ V. You would say that.

1627
01:58:11,436 --> 01:58:12,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course I would.

1628
01:58:13,858 --> 01:58:17,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on with some more news, Loki.

1629
01:58:17,741 --> 01:58:19,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we've got the mailbag coming up in just a minute.

1630
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:24,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Live Indie Games Winter Uprising Indie Games Winter Uprising

1631
01:58:39,562 --> 01:58:40,923
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1632
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:06,842
[SPEAKER_03]: and I believe now all the games have been released that are a part of that.

1633
01:59:08,322 --> 01:59:20,747
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the few last ones here, Cthulhu Saves the World, apparently came out earlier last week and then also they had Breath of Death 7, which was the last one.

1634
01:59:20,907 --> 01:59:23,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Cthulhu Saves the World, it looks like it was made with RPG Maker.

1635
01:59:26,423 --> 01:59:32,486
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you can check those out and check out the little link on Indie Games Winter Uprising.

1636
01:59:32,626 --> 01:59:36,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus there's plenty of games out there that really need to be checked out.

1637
01:59:36,407 --> 01:59:39,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of them, actually all of them, have free demos.

1638
01:59:41,169 --> 01:59:41,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're cheap.

1639
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:43,710
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them are really cheap out there.

1640
01:59:43,931 --> 01:59:45,811
[SPEAKER_03]: So check out the demos.

1641
01:59:46,272 --> 01:59:47,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy the full game.

1642
01:59:50,598 --> 01:59:53,299
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the huge indie games that I should be playing?

1643
01:59:53,339 --> 01:59:54,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know of any?

1644
01:59:54,380 --> 02:00:00,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I tried a couple, and I've got to admit, nothing that really made me want to come on the show and talk about it.

1645
02:00:00,042 --> 02:00:01,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you played Carnieville?

1646
02:00:02,283 --> 02:00:02,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't.

1647
02:00:03,244 --> 02:00:04,104
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to play Carnieville.

1648
02:00:04,124 --> 02:00:06,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at that Breath of Death whatever, though.

1649
02:00:06,485 --> 02:00:07,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to download that.

1650
02:00:07,606 --> 02:00:08,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't get around to it.

1651
02:00:08,706 --> 02:00:14,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Carnivale Showtime is one of the first indie games I picked up and it's awesome.

1652
02:00:15,291 --> 02:00:16,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.

1653
02:00:18,214 --> 02:00:25,699
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a game where you launch this clown ragdoll thing into the air and you collect balloons and stuff.

1654
02:00:27,601 --> 02:00:28,782
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really...

1655
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:31,540
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1656
02:00:48,626 --> 02:00:54,509
[SPEAKER_03]: It was some sort of like Obama fighting game or something like that.

1657
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:57,031
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, what the hell was it?

1658
02:00:57,171 --> 02:00:59,532
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something ridiculous.

1659
02:00:59,612 --> 02:01:10,378
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like some dude that was running around and like there'd be people and they're trying to attack you and you can like pick up a bus and smash them with the bus and

1660
02:01:11,453 --> 02:01:12,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you showed me videos of that.

1661
02:01:12,634 --> 02:01:13,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

1662
02:01:13,175 --> 02:01:14,797
[SPEAKER_04]: They looked like bad dudes or something.

1663
02:01:14,877 --> 02:01:16,078
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty funny.

1664
02:01:16,699 --> 02:01:18,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a bad enough dude to be the president?

1665
02:01:20,204 --> 02:01:20,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1666
02:01:22,266 --> 02:01:23,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, what do you think of some others?

1667
02:01:24,269 --> 02:01:24,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1668
02:01:24,589 --> 02:01:26,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really been on indie games in a while, so...

1669
02:01:27,773 --> 02:01:28,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_04]: But, yep.

1685
02:02:55,336 --> 02:02:58,203

1686
02:02:58,263 --> 02:02:59,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people are predicting it'll be $2.99.

1687
02:03:01,167 --> 02:03:13,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna say I agree with that $2.99 and the Zelda Ocarina of Time is the pack-in because it's a huge game without being a lot of money spent by Nintendo you know what I mean?

1688
02:03:14,174 --> 02:03:25,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'll be the pack-in game will be the camera, the Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D maybe some samplers with some of these other trailers and so stuff other stuff but it won't be Kid Icarus tell you that that will not be the pack-in game

1689
02:03:28,439 --> 02:03:32,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and that's just, I have nothing to go off of, just what I think.

1690
02:03:33,821 --> 02:03:35,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to what you think in the mailbag.

1691
02:03:35,441 --> 02:03:39,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a place to send your emails every week.

1692
02:03:39,863 --> 02:03:44,864
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag and pick some of her favorite emails and read them for us here on the air.

1693
02:03:45,184 --> 02:03:45,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I will.

1694
02:03:45,704 --> 02:03:47,405
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the holidays slowed people down, didn't it?

1695
02:03:47,992 --> 02:03:48,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1696
02:03:49,413 --> 02:03:50,033
[SPEAKER_09]: This one.

1697
02:03:50,473 --> 02:03:54,475
[SPEAKER_09]: The OLR 2010 Predictions Forum thread died early this year.

1698
02:03:54,775 --> 02:03:55,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Dull.

1699
02:03:55,256 --> 02:03:58,577
[SPEAKER_09]: We got next to nothing, and mine were all wrong, but thankfully so.

1700
02:03:59,017 --> 02:04:00,118
[SPEAKER_09]: This is, by the way, from Rababa.

1701
02:04:01,299 --> 02:04:03,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't be posting a 2011 thread this year.

1702
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:07,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to mention a heavily self-biased list of some notable things that happened.

1703
02:04:07,602 --> 02:04:09,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't include the stuff that was part of your year-end wrap-ups.

1704
02:04:10,483 --> 02:04:11,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to do it anyway.

1705
02:04:11,404 --> 02:04:13,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we didn't even end up doing your year-end wrap-ups, so there you go.

1706
02:04:13,925 --> 02:04:14,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1707
02:04:15,406 --> 02:04:20,950
[SPEAKER_09]: 2010 Slimeball Award, Activision Dismantling of Infinity Ward was so as not to pay bonuses.

1708
02:04:21,010 --> 02:04:25,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone looking for another job while being gamefully employed is not a reason to fire them.

1709
02:04:26,114 --> 02:04:31,718
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, the games industry will be best served if you encourage career development across companies.

1710
02:04:32,299 --> 02:04:34,681
[SPEAKER_09]: The decision was very profit-oriented and slimy.

1711
02:04:35,341 --> 02:04:43,588
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing I hope the developer studios should have learned is to put in their contracts that bonuses are paid based on project, not employment.

1712
02:04:44,828 --> 02:04:45,849
[SPEAKER_09]: 2010 Last to the Party Award.

1713
02:04:46,009 --> 02:04:46,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Me!

1714
02:04:46,349 --> 02:04:49,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I joined Facebook in August.

1715
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:51,451
[SPEAKER_09]: 2010 Developer of the Year, PopCap.

1716
02:04:51,932 --> 02:04:54,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Their games are not hard-hitting, but they sure are fun.

1717
02:04:54,253 --> 02:04:56,794
[SPEAKER_09]: PopCap is really good at breathing new life into old games.

1718
02:04:56,854 --> 02:04:59,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Plant vs. Zombies on new systems with new features.

1719
02:04:59,455 --> 02:05:01,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Bejeweled 3, Zuma's Revenge, and Zuma Blitz.

1720
02:05:02,836 --> 02:05:04,817
[SPEAKER_09]: 2010 Welcome to the 21st Century Award, Steam.

1721
02:05:05,537 --> 02:05:09,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Steam made no-box direct sales of software worth it with their great prices.

1722
02:05:09,919 --> 02:05:13,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Think you shouldn't pay as much for a game because the cost of packaging and media isn't an issue?

1723
02:05:13,541 --> 02:05:14,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Steam understands that.

1724
02:05:15,082 --> 02:05:19,644
[SPEAKER_09]: The newest games are pricey, but their sales, like the year-end one right now, make it affordable.

1725
02:05:21,586 --> 02:05:23,149
[SPEAKER_09]: 2010 best use of meat in a game's title?

1726
02:05:23,249 --> 02:05:23,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Meat Boy.

1727
02:05:24,391 --> 02:05:27,437
[SPEAKER_09]: They managed to use the initials SMB to hilarious effects.

1728
02:05:28,198 --> 02:05:30,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking forward to what you guys come up with.

1729
02:05:34,707 --> 02:05:35,407
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cute.

1730
02:05:36,248 --> 02:05:36,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Last one.

1731
02:05:37,568 --> 02:05:42,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear peoples of the intertubes, you put out the call on Twitter for gaming-related New Year's resolutions.

1732
02:05:43,191 --> 02:05:45,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, most of my resolutions have to do with writing.

1733
02:05:45,892 --> 02:05:52,415
[SPEAKER_09]: My only vaguely gaming-related one is to pay off my credit card, which I've only used to buy my two-year-old laptop.

1734
02:05:53,055 --> 02:05:55,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Besides, I don't make resolutions as much as I make goals.

1735
02:05:55,677 --> 02:05:58,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Goals tend not to have an expiration date that leads to disappointment in yourself.

1736
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:00,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay black, Redertainment.

1737
02:06:00,961 --> 02:06:05,984
[SPEAKER_09]: This message was brought to you by Windows 7, which totally fucked up my two-year-old laptop sent for my iPad.

1738
02:06:08,386 --> 02:06:10,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you gotta have the money to buy the games, so...

1739
02:06:12,428 --> 02:06:18,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Good old reliable iPad If you pay off your credit card, you can always run it all up again Just kidding You know what I have noticed?

1740
02:06:18,972 --> 02:06:19,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go too crazy What?

1741
02:06:20,273 --> 02:06:23,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I have better luck sending emails from my iPhone than I do my PC sometimes Really?

1742
02:06:24,055 --> 02:06:36,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Because my iPhone has never crashed on me Alright, well let's get to the FUs of the week I've had iPhone apps crash on me, just so you know I've had apps crash, but there's no such thing as a BSOD on an iPhone

1743
02:06:37,734 --> 02:06:37,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet.

1744
02:06:38,755 --> 02:06:42,197
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a such thing as the alarms suddenly not working on the iPhone.

1745
02:06:42,217 --> 02:06:43,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've heard about that.

1746
02:06:43,458 --> 02:06:44,979
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not a perfect world.

1747
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:46,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the FUs of the week.

1748
02:07:02,481 --> 02:07:12,389
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to my back and now my butt because I was playing with my friend's son and he's heavy.

1749
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:17,853
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've wrenched my lower back and it's settled in my right side.

1750
02:07:18,414 --> 02:07:19,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a bad hip for the record.

1751
02:07:19,655 --> 02:07:22,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been in two car accidents and injured my hip both times.

1752
02:07:23,818 --> 02:07:26,200
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm in a lot of pain.

1753
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:28,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I've taken significant Vicodin today.

1754
02:07:29,222 --> 02:07:29,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Significant.

1755
02:07:30,263 --> 02:07:30,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't say how much.

1756
02:07:32,044 --> 02:07:33,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, I still hurt.

1757
02:07:34,485 --> 02:07:36,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm walking around like I'm, you know, 90.

1758
02:07:37,687 --> 02:07:38,467
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't like it.

1759
02:07:38,767 --> 02:07:42,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I F you to the tail end of this cold that refuses to go away.

1760
02:07:42,669 --> 02:07:45,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Which makes me very, uh, antisocial and bitchy.

1761
02:07:50,012 --> 02:07:50,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that all?

1762
02:07:52,153 --> 02:07:52,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Loki.

1763
02:07:53,674 --> 02:07:54,794
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your F you to the week, Loki?

1764
02:07:54,814 --> 02:07:58,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my F you to the week would be to, um...

1765
02:08:00,623 --> 02:08:02,008
[SPEAKER_03]: The weather sucks.

1766
02:08:03,935 --> 02:08:04,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have anything.

1767
02:08:05,562 --> 02:08:06,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary, any FUs of the week?

1768
02:08:06,883 --> 02:08:08,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Things that are making you mad?

1769
02:08:09,785 --> 02:08:13,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have to agree with Loki on that one.

1770
02:08:13,908 --> 02:08:18,451
[SPEAKER_05]: The weather around here has blown goats all days yesterday and today.

1771
02:08:19,011 --> 02:08:20,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate rain, but I've said that before.

1772
02:08:22,614 --> 02:08:28,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, other people remind me that yes, we need it, but still, it makes everything, especially with driving, more difficult.

1773
02:08:28,978 --> 02:08:33,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, that's the only one I want to say right now.

1774
02:08:33,621 --> 02:08:34,222
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1775
02:08:49,938 --> 02:08:54,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say F you to Comcast, my internet provider.

1776
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:55,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1777
02:08:55,940 --> 02:08:57,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Comcast is evil.

1778
02:08:57,041 --> 02:08:59,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Because my internet is still dropping out.

1779
02:08:59,462 --> 02:09:02,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had a guy come out to my house last week to try to fix it.

1780
02:09:02,183 --> 02:09:04,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun.

1781
02:09:04,503 --> 02:09:08,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm still getting randomly dropped from the internet, which is affecting my Warcraft playing.

1782
02:09:09,105 --> 02:09:09,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Addict.

1783
02:09:09,625 --> 02:09:10,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Rawr.

1784
02:09:10,505 --> 02:09:11,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1785
02:09:11,386 --> 02:09:17,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie and I have a mutual friend who has Comcast, and she's always complaining about issues with it, so I can feel your pain on that one.

1786
02:09:17,788 --> 02:09:28,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, at least the tech who came to my house was really nice, but I kind of got the sense in just what he was saying that, yeah, this seems to be a problem in Comcast's office, and I'm just really here to validate that there's a problem.

1787
02:09:28,313 --> 02:09:30,894
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, so frustrating.

1788
02:09:30,954 --> 02:09:34,836
[SPEAKER_09]: At least nobody came into your neighborhood and snapped the main fiber optic cable.

1789
02:09:35,716 --> 02:09:36,677
[SPEAKER_09]: You remember when that happened to me?

1790
02:09:36,857 --> 02:09:38,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not Comcast, though.

1791
02:09:38,158 --> 02:09:39,059
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just some jackass.

1792
02:09:39,079 --> 02:09:39,800
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some asshole.

1793
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:40,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1794
02:09:41,621 --> 02:09:43,643
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, that's it for my FUs of the week.

1795
02:09:43,803 --> 02:09:47,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Just FU to the fact I can't run instances in WoW because I always get disconnected.

1796
02:09:48,427 --> 02:09:49,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Rude and ignorant.

1797
02:09:49,926 --> 02:09:53,909
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple more news stories for you guys in the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR.

1798
02:09:53,929 --> 02:09:54,529
[SPEAKER_04]: But not just yet.

1799
02:09:54,569 --> 02:09:55,810
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got two more stories for you.

1800
02:09:55,890 --> 02:09:56,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1801
02:09:56,951 --> 02:09:57,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1802
02:09:58,372 --> 02:10:03,035
[SPEAKER_03]: So to kind of wrap things up, and this is surprising.

1803
02:10:03,116 --> 02:10:05,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God I haven't run across it probably because it's in a different region.

1804
02:10:06,338 --> 02:10:18,747
[SPEAKER_03]: But Android, the marketplace, is getting a few games that are actually Trojan horses that are letting, I guess, malicious hackers possibly use your phone as part of a botnet.

1805
02:10:19,608 --> 02:10:26,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, apparently in China, um, on their app store, there's, I guess, um, a few apps that are affected by this.

1806
02:10:26,838 --> 02:10:32,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Monkey Jump 2, Sex Positions, President vs. Aliens, and, um...

1807
02:10:35,049 --> 02:10:37,071
[SPEAKER_03]: City Defense and Baseball Superstars 2010

1808
02:10:51,339 --> 02:11:02,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Though the intent of this Trojan isn't entirely clear, the possibilities range from setting up a malicious mobile ad network to creating an Android botnet.

1809
02:11:04,889 --> 02:11:10,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly affected apps could be posted to the app stores targeting US users in the future.

1810
02:11:12,478 --> 02:11:14,521
[SPEAKER_03]: So just be on the lookout.

1811
02:11:17,545 --> 02:11:20,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I worry about the day something like this happens to the iPhone.

1812
02:11:20,228 --> 02:11:21,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Android's bad enough.

1813
02:11:21,290 --> 02:11:22,351
[SPEAKER_04]: There's enough people who use that.

1814
02:11:22,391 --> 02:11:24,654
[SPEAKER_04]: But boy, oh boy, when something like this happens on iPhone.

1815
02:11:24,674 --> 02:11:26,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I think their app store is more open than...

1816
02:11:27,498 --> 02:11:28,119
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1817
02:11:28,199 --> 02:11:31,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everything does have to go through that rigid approval process with Apple.

1818
02:11:31,682 --> 02:11:34,344
[SPEAKER_04]: But you just wonder when something's going to slip through the cracks, you know?

1819
02:11:34,445 --> 02:11:35,305
[SPEAKER_05]: It will eventually.

1820
02:11:35,325 --> 02:11:35,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1821
02:11:36,106 --> 02:11:38,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they can always pull it like that.

1822
02:11:38,088 --> 02:11:38,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the cocaine app?

1823
02:11:38,809 --> 02:11:39,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it gets out there.

1824
02:11:40,530 --> 02:11:41,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the cocaine app?

1825
02:11:41,231 --> 02:11:41,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard about that.

1826
02:11:41,971 --> 02:11:42,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

1827
02:11:42,972 --> 02:11:44,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the... What was the one?

1828
02:11:44,053 --> 02:11:47,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about like baby... Oh, it was really bad.

1829
02:11:47,276 --> 02:11:50,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something like punching babies or something and somehow it got approved.

1830
02:11:50,179 --> 02:11:51,000
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really terrible.

1831
02:11:51,660 --> 02:11:51,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1832
02:11:52,341 --> 02:11:53,523
[SPEAKER_04]: The Legend of Zelda The Legend of Zelda

1833
02:12:09,963 --> 02:12:11,864
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1834
02:12:25,194 --> 02:12:25,715
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1835
02:12:46,476 --> 02:12:47,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, what's that?

1836
02:12:47,076 --> 02:12:47,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm downloading it.

1837
02:13:14,089 --> 02:13:14,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course you are.

1838
02:13:15,090 --> 02:13:41,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It is available on this website called, let's see, it was originally put on this forums at lostlevels.org which I think gets into a lot of these types of prototype issues and I guess there's more information available as well on a website called thecuttingroomfloortcrf.net which is a whole little like Wikipedia type thing that will detail all of the changes if you really want to know what rooms led different rooms and

1839
02:13:41,633 --> 02:13:43,134
[SPEAKER_04]: How the item drops were different.

1840
02:13:43,174 --> 02:13:46,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they get into the real nitty gritty about this.

1841
02:13:46,836 --> 02:13:49,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people will just kind of go, eh, neat, a couple things are different.

1842
02:13:50,478 --> 02:14:04,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, again, if you're going to download stuff like this, though, you should consider, you know, at least owning a legitimate copy of this, be it through Virtual Console or one of the 50,000 times Nintendo has released these games, be it in compilations or what have you.

1843
02:14:06,547 --> 02:14:07,588
[SPEAKER_04]: But I say, you know what?

1844
02:14:09,111 --> 02:14:14,693
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you have one of those other games or you've had at some point in your life, I think you're entitled to take a peek at this game.

1845
02:14:16,693 --> 02:14:19,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that is it for the news tonight.

1846
02:14:19,394 --> 02:14:20,734
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to open up the Skype line.

1847
02:14:21,294 --> 02:14:22,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get some calls.

1848
02:14:22,115 --> 02:14:25,776
[SPEAKER_04]: 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1849
02:14:25,816 --> 02:14:26,436
[SPEAKER_04]: First calls of 2011.

1850
02:14:26,496 --> 02:14:31,197
[SPEAKER_04]: The delay is bigger tonight, so it's about a minute.

1851
02:14:31,617 --> 02:14:34,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any last minute stories while we wait for some calls to come in?

1852
02:14:34,676 --> 02:14:35,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Try Not To Fart

1853
02:14:56,531 --> 02:14:58,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the box art for that.

1854
02:14:59,613 --> 02:15:01,475
[SPEAKER_03]: How exactly do you not fart?

1855
02:15:01,635 --> 02:15:02,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's button presses.

1856
02:15:03,016 --> 02:15:04,517
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to mimic the button presses.

1857
02:15:04,877 --> 02:15:12,322
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have different situations, eating dinner with your girlfriend's parents or wedding.

1858
02:15:12,562 --> 02:15:16,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I remembered one of the indie games that I played that was really, really bad.

1859
02:15:16,305 --> 02:15:17,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called Maids with Balloons.

1860
02:15:18,346 --> 02:15:19,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh I saw that!

1861
02:15:40,172 --> 02:15:42,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, it was kind of poop.

1862
02:15:43,494 --> 02:15:50,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're supposed to support indie games and all that stuff, but it's very clear what this game is all about, and it's not the game.

1863
02:15:50,656 --> 02:15:51,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like an epic fail.

1864
02:15:52,397 --> 02:15:56,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Inside Lacrosse's College Lacrosse 2010.

1865
02:15:57,139 --> 02:15:58,179
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good one.

1866
02:15:58,199 --> 02:16:00,600
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get to the call.

1867
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:02,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1868
02:16:02,061 --> 02:16:02,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1869
02:16:03,749 --> 02:16:07,010
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ranma, and yes, SSJ100, Matt, is correct.

1870
02:16:07,070 --> 02:16:08,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the first one of the year.

1871
02:16:09,571 --> 02:16:11,712
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the first one of every goddamn show, but you know what?

1872
02:16:11,952 --> 02:16:12,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what I say.

1873
02:16:12,652 --> 02:16:16,773
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't like Ranma getting through first every time, they have Skype on the iPhone.

1874
02:16:17,653 --> 02:16:19,034
[SPEAKER_04]: You can call us at Orange Lounge Radio.

1875
02:16:19,054 --> 02:16:20,714
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a toll-free number, for heaven's sakes.

1876
02:16:20,774 --> 02:16:22,755
[SPEAKER_04]: There's plenty of ways to get through to the show.

1877
02:16:22,855 --> 02:16:26,616
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're the only one that wants to have your voice be heard, then so be it.

1878
02:16:26,676 --> 02:16:27,476
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind tonight?

1879
02:16:28,137 --> 02:16:30,758
[SPEAKER_02]: There are weeks where I let people jump the line.

1880
02:16:30,818 --> 02:16:31,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even bother, but...

1881
02:16:34,011 --> 02:16:35,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be on my merry little way

1882
02:16:48,390 --> 02:16:48,950
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be nice.

1883
02:16:49,310 --> 02:16:51,731
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think competition is sometimes a little bit healthy.

1884
02:16:52,011 --> 02:16:59,012
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what really frustrates me to no end about this whole Comcast stuff is that there's no real competition in this area.

1885
02:16:59,112 --> 02:17:05,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess we're starting to see more and more AT&T U-verse, and some people would tell me, oh, well, there's DSL.

1886
02:17:05,834 --> 02:17:10,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm actually getting to the point where I don't care if DSL is like a fourth as fast as cable.

1887
02:17:10,715 --> 02:17:13,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to fucking switch if they can't figure this problem out.

1888
02:17:14,336 --> 02:17:14,836
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1889
02:17:15,476 --> 02:17:15,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you.

1890
02:17:16,417 --> 02:17:19,379
[SPEAKER_02]: DSL isn't as fast, but it's just more dependable and more reliable.

1891
02:17:19,539 --> 02:17:22,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's part of the reason why I switched to fiber optic.

1892
02:17:22,121 --> 02:17:24,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I had cable, but you know what?

1893
02:17:25,283 --> 02:17:35,829
[SPEAKER_02]: When the cable modem goes out at 12 midnight during off-peak hours for 5-10 minutes at a time, I'm switching to something else that's a lot better and besides.

1894
02:17:36,770 --> 02:17:38,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Fios TV.

1895
02:17:38,271 --> 02:17:41,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Pictures a lot sharper and a lot cleaner than what Cablevision was offering.

1896
02:17:41,752 --> 02:17:43,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even really watch TV.

1897
02:17:43,152 --> 02:17:44,632
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about Netflix and all that now.

1898
02:17:44,672 --> 02:17:48,614
[SPEAKER_04]: But you live in New York City, too, where you probably have more options.

1899
02:17:49,094 --> 02:17:53,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Being here in Sacramento, it's not that Sacramento doesn't have... It's not like we're a podunk town.

1900
02:17:53,395 --> 02:17:56,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're number 20 in the nation or something like that.

1901
02:17:56,956 --> 02:18:01,998
[SPEAKER_04]: But I live a little bit on the outskirts of Sacramento, so I don't think I have as many options where I live.

1902
02:18:03,238 --> 02:18:08,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear where you're coming from because where I am, my options are either Cablevision or Verizon.

1903
02:18:08,099 --> 02:18:14,360
[SPEAKER_02]: You go in certain parts of New York City, it's either Time Warner or Verizon and sometimes it's RCN or AT&T.

1904
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:15,300
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on where you go.

1905
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:18,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Big Wang Eater in our chat room is saying, fucking switch.

1906
02:18:19,021 --> 02:18:19,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Switch, bitch.

1907
02:18:20,301 --> 02:18:22,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I will switch to eating Big Wang.

1908
02:18:22,722 --> 02:18:23,762
[SPEAKER_04]: That's who I will switch to.

1909
02:18:24,702 --> 02:18:26,022
[SPEAKER_02]: How long ago did you switch to that?

1910
02:18:27,903 --> 02:18:28,923
[SPEAKER_02]: You opened the door.

1911
02:18:28,963 --> 02:18:29,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1912
02:18:29,703 --> 02:18:30,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I plead the fifth.

1913
02:18:32,739 --> 02:18:33,159
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back.

1914
02:18:53,755 --> 02:19:20,146
[SPEAKER_04]: that's all I want oh yes and even with DSL speeds coming up you have to pay more for it let's get back to gaming talk yeah sorry well hey it directly affects my games it's not just wow it's PlayStation Network and this whole White Knight Chronicles being online enabled I can't keep a connection it's getting bad so anyhow I feel you so what else is on your mind my friend anything else

1915
02:19:21,423 --> 02:19:22,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcade Infinity.

1916
02:19:22,403 --> 02:19:29,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, before we get into that, just so you know, Colt 45 is a malt liquor, not a beer.

1917
02:19:30,467 --> 02:19:34,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to pour a 40, you're pouring a 40 of malt liquor.

1918
02:19:34,649 --> 02:19:35,629
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't pour beer.

1919
02:19:35,769 --> 02:19:36,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Beer is tasty.

1920
02:19:36,750 --> 02:19:38,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Malt liquor, not so much.

1921
02:19:38,831 --> 02:19:39,051
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1922
02:19:40,111 --> 02:19:43,093
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I said an ice cold Colt 45.

1923
02:19:43,273 --> 02:19:46,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything in a can is the same to me unless it's Guinness.

1924
02:19:46,314 --> 02:19:47,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But Guinness is better out of a bottle.

1925
02:19:47,675 --> 02:19:47,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Truth.

1926
02:19:49,741 --> 02:19:50,982
[SPEAKER_02]: True dat, true dat.

1927
02:19:51,142 --> 02:19:52,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Even better on tap.

1928
02:19:52,583 --> 02:19:53,043
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1929
02:19:53,404 --> 02:19:53,864
[SPEAKER_04]: More truth.

1930
02:19:55,305 --> 02:19:58,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty, Ranma, I'm going to go ahead and let you go.

1931
02:19:58,447 --> 02:20:01,409
[SPEAKER_04]: But wait, actually, one more question because I'm going to ask this of all our callers tonight.

1932
02:20:01,870 --> 02:20:05,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Your favorite game of last year using any criteria you want.

1933
02:20:05,132 --> 02:20:06,313
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no right or wrong answer.

1934
02:20:07,494 --> 02:20:09,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, the game.

1935
02:20:10,236 --> 02:20:10,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Because...

1936
02:20:12,352 --> 02:20:16,713
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the, again, it's the only game I played more than any other game of all of last year.

1937
02:20:17,073 --> 02:20:20,494
[SPEAKER_02]: It just brought me back to my favorite beat-em-ups.

1938
02:20:20,514 --> 02:20:23,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a game where people would just come over.

1939
02:20:23,675 --> 02:20:25,976
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the number two game in my house next to Rock Band.

1940
02:20:26,016 --> 02:20:27,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we could get people together and have fun.

1941
02:20:28,016 --> 02:20:32,998
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like, I felt like I was like 10, 11, 12 years old playing this game, you know?

1942
02:20:33,438 --> 02:20:34,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing's wrong with that.

1943
02:20:34,298 --> 02:20:35,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun is where it's at.

1944
02:20:35,479 --> 02:20:36,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Got that right.

1945
02:20:36,199 --> 02:20:37,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Rama, you have a good one.

1946
02:20:37,499 --> 02:20:38,279
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time.

1947
02:20:38,900 --> 02:20:39,360
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it.

1948
02:20:39,460 --> 02:20:39,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1949
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:40,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1950
02:20:41,137 --> 02:21:00,924
[SPEAKER_04]: 877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Give us a call, we'll talk SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says Guinness is a meal, really Well, yeah, I mean Well, it's liquid bread I suppose you could look at it that way And there's no other last minute stories in-house We've got nothing but calls to go on

1951
02:21:02,024 --> 02:21:03,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to make more recommendations.

1952
02:21:03,986 --> 02:21:06,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, give us a couple more while we wait for some calls.

1953
02:21:07,189 --> 02:21:09,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot One Up was supposed to be a really good one.

1954
02:21:10,371 --> 02:21:12,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty cheap.

1955
02:21:13,074 --> 02:21:14,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Explosion Aid was another good one.

1956
02:21:14,975 --> 02:21:16,917
[SPEAKER_03]: That was by the guys that did Weapon of Choice.

1957
02:21:17,457 --> 02:21:19,239
[SPEAKER_03]: And really cool looking shooter game.

1958
02:21:19,379 --> 02:21:19,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Here comes a call.

1959
02:21:20,460 --> 02:21:21,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1960
02:21:21,521 --> 02:21:21,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1961
02:21:22,561 --> 02:21:23,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zaku here.

1962
02:21:23,602 --> 02:21:24,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my friend.

1963
02:21:24,203 --> 02:21:25,944
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

1964
02:21:26,024 --> 02:21:26,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Doing pretty good.

1965
02:21:27,245 --> 02:21:27,846
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1966
02:21:28,962 --> 02:21:31,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Nah, I know Adam mentioned Arcade Infinity.

1967
02:21:31,504 --> 02:21:33,105
[SPEAKER_14]: You probably already covered this to death.

1968
02:21:33,865 --> 02:21:38,488
[SPEAKER_14]: But the way I see it is that I'm surprised it managed to go this long.

1969
02:21:39,909 --> 02:21:47,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Given the fact that, you know, round one pretty much was a death blow to them.

1970
02:21:48,314 --> 02:21:50,735
[SPEAKER_14]: And don't get me wrong with round one.

1971
02:21:50,796 --> 02:21:54,458
[SPEAKER_14]: At least they're like an authentic Japanese entertainment center to an extent.

1972
02:21:55,578 --> 02:21:58,000
[SPEAKER_14]: And they do a lot better than D&B, but

1973
02:21:58,499 --> 02:21:59,179
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1974
02:21:59,499 --> 02:22:01,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Arcades are pretty much dead at this point.

1975
02:22:01,460 --> 02:22:02,541
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to say it.

1976
02:22:02,881 --> 02:22:03,381
[SPEAKER_14]: They're dead.

1977
02:22:03,581 --> 02:22:04,521
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just not dying.

1978
02:22:04,902 --> 02:22:05,862
[SPEAKER_14]: They're pretty much dead.

1979
02:22:06,462 --> 02:22:11,144
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny you bring up D&B because I was at Dave & Buster's this week and it's still kicking.

1980
02:22:11,424 --> 02:22:12,344
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still quite a few people there.

1981
02:22:12,364 --> 02:22:13,785
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but that's corporate owned.

1982
02:22:13,845 --> 02:22:18,187
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm talking about mom and pop operations like Arcade Infinity.

1983
02:22:18,267 --> 02:22:18,747
[SPEAKER_14]: I gotcha.

1984
02:22:20,147 --> 02:22:21,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are on their way out.

1985
02:22:21,608 --> 02:22:23,989
[SPEAKER_14]: The rest of them are pretty much on death row.

1986
02:22:24,690 --> 02:22:30,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless, of course, you have foot traffic, but yeah, it's a disaster state of affairs now.

1987
02:22:31,724 --> 02:22:35,832
[SPEAKER_14]: It just, you know, it doesn't make sense when, you know,

1988
02:22:37,509 --> 02:22:40,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I get... No, I get what you're saying.

1989
02:22:40,691 --> 02:22:48,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, it's one of those things where, yeah, we covered the story here, and it was kind of one of those, oh, that's kind of sad, but it's also not surprising.

1990
02:22:48,396 --> 02:22:49,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's just... You're right.

1991
02:22:49,917 --> 02:22:59,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcades have been kind of going this way, and there's not been a lot that's really made us have to go, oh, we've got to go to the arcade and have that experience, because now we have the internet, you know?

1992
02:22:59,483 --> 02:22:59,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1993
02:23:01,343 --> 02:23:05,345
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so weird because OLR started because of arcade culture.

1994
02:23:05,945 --> 02:23:08,225
[SPEAKER_04]: And that couldn't happen today.

1995
02:23:08,425 --> 02:23:10,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of sad in a way.

1996
02:23:10,946 --> 02:23:15,187
[SPEAKER_04]: But even our little arcade culture has moved to the internet in its own little way.

1997
02:23:15,728 --> 02:23:18,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not like the internet didn't exist then because we used to have our own little forums.

1998
02:23:19,269 --> 02:23:23,350
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sacramentals were our little DDR team and so forth, which wasn't really a team.

1999
02:23:23,390 --> 02:23:24,990
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just kids that played DDR.

2000
02:23:25,430 --> 02:23:26,931
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know...

2001
02:23:27,751 --> 02:23:28,512
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX Live and MMOs

2002
02:23:45,158 --> 02:24:13,629
[SPEAKER_04]: it's pretty much on it's days are pretty much numbered somebody has to innovate somebody has to innovate somewhere and of course I don't know what that answer is or I'd be a freaking millionaire but surely there is something where people would want to do it in person you know what I mean there's got to be something that will get people I always want to do it in person you know what I mean the folks who run the classic arcades they're probably going to be around for a while because all of that generation of

2003
02:24:14,431 --> 02:24:14,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

2004
02:24:28,422 --> 02:24:31,243
[SPEAKER_14]: and just, you know, pick up the torch where they left off.

2005
02:24:31,764 --> 02:24:36,486
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, as long as they're right, as long as they're like running a tight ship.

2006
02:24:36,766 --> 02:24:37,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I gotta say this.

2007
02:24:37,907 --> 02:24:38,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say this though too.

2008
02:24:39,067 --> 02:24:40,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's be real.

2009
02:24:40,908 --> 02:24:43,629
[SPEAKER_04]: AI also, it was in kind of a shitty location.

2010
02:24:44,230 --> 02:24:45,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, round one.

2011
02:24:45,790 --> 02:24:57,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't really have a lot of advertising and I realized it was an independent thing but unless you were kind of on the internet, I had no idea about this place until I was like online and posting on DDR boards.

2012
02:24:57,876 --> 02:24:58,756
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not even that.

2013
02:24:59,216 --> 02:25:01,917
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard they were getting flack from the city.

2014
02:25:02,137 --> 02:25:04,998
[SPEAKER_14]: They were really hesitant about renewing their licenses.

2015
02:25:05,038 --> 02:25:05,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

2016
02:25:05,838 --> 02:25:06,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Sad.

2017
02:25:06,218 --> 02:25:06,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

2018
02:25:06,998 --> 02:25:18,260
[SPEAKER_14]: And coupled with the fact that their landlord raised their rent constantly, raised their rent to the point where they had no choice but to be driven out.

2019
02:25:18,620 --> 02:25:20,741
[SPEAKER_14]: And then round one showed up.

2020
02:25:21,181 --> 02:25:25,602
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was like so many forces and they pretty much were

2021
02:25:26,621 --> 02:25:31,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me ask you, I've been asking everybody else to wrap up and get more calls.

2022
02:25:31,883 --> 02:25:33,623
[SPEAKER_14]: What was your favorite game of all last year?

2023
02:25:33,643 --> 02:25:34,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Any criteria you want?

2024
02:25:34,744 --> 02:25:35,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see.

2025
02:25:56,525 --> 02:25:57,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Any criteria?

2026
02:25:57,445 --> 02:26:01,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Would that be... I'm thinking Bad Company, too.

2027
02:26:02,068 --> 02:26:03,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is that?

2028
02:26:03,908 --> 02:26:05,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Just because of its crack-like addictions.

2029
02:26:05,989 --> 02:26:14,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially the multiplayer, where even though it's team-based, it's just like on the PC, there's no ass-hattery.

2030
02:26:14,914 --> 02:26:15,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone helps.

2031
02:26:15,754 --> 02:26:16,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone fights.

2032
02:26:16,794 --> 02:26:17,435
[SPEAKER_14]: No one quits.

2033
02:26:18,829 --> 02:26:45,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish there could be less asshattery in online games that is one thing I would say Red Dead Redemption but I just started that game a few days ago that is one thing I will say that arcades always kind of have over the online stuff is that online you can hide behind your monitor but in arcades if you're going to be an asshole you have to be an asshole to people's faces that's one thing I do miss about arcades alright Zaku I gotta let you go because we can get more calls have a good one buddy later

2034
02:26:48,046 --> 02:26:49,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll get to some more calls.

2035
02:26:49,147 --> 02:26:50,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2036
02:26:50,188 --> 02:26:50,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2037
02:26:51,649 --> 02:26:52,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up guys?

2038
02:26:52,329 --> 02:26:53,030
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Kaijudo.

2039
02:26:53,450 --> 02:26:54,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaijudo, what's on your mind, buddy?

2040
02:26:55,872 --> 02:26:56,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Not much.

2041
02:26:56,172 --> 02:26:57,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on, my phone is crapping out on me.

2042
02:26:58,134 --> 02:27:00,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, my game of the year was Mag, for sure.

2043
02:27:01,196 --> 02:27:02,157
[SPEAKER_12]: I really enjoyed that game.

2044
02:27:02,457 --> 02:27:02,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Mag?

2045
02:27:02,917 --> 02:27:03,698
[SPEAKER_12]: My game of the decade.

2046
02:27:04,218 --> 02:27:04,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Mag.

2047
02:27:04,739 --> 02:27:06,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Game of the decade?

2048
02:27:07,421 --> 02:27:08,141
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know Mag.

2049
02:27:08,421 --> 02:27:10,743
[SPEAKER_04]: They've even announced a sequel to Mag already, right?

2050
02:27:12,044 --> 02:27:13,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah, I've heard some news about it.

2051
02:27:13,265 --> 02:27:16,908
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that Zipper has a podcast where they discuss the game, but I haven't

2052
02:27:17,327 --> 02:27:18,008
[SPEAKER_12]: and DarkSakura.com

2053
02:27:32,901 --> 02:27:35,102
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Loki would be right there with you, buddy.

2054
02:27:35,303 --> 02:27:38,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, Grand Theft Auto 4, Game of the Decade, possibly?

2055
02:27:39,186 --> 02:27:39,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe?

2056
02:27:40,927 --> 02:27:41,568
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty good.

2057
02:27:42,148 --> 02:27:46,091
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if I... Yeah, you had people complaining about the water.

2058
02:27:46,612 --> 02:27:52,316
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was some of the best computer-generated water I've ever slammed in a game, and I can't believe people even hated that.

2059
02:27:52,737 --> 02:27:53,017
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2060
02:27:53,450 --> 02:27:54,650
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a weird hate for that game.

2061
02:27:54,790 --> 02:27:59,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when that's, like, if you're complaining about the water above everything else, like, really?

2062
02:28:00,111 --> 02:28:01,451
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of a stretch, you know?

2063
02:28:02,031 --> 02:28:04,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I can think of games that have many more problems than the water.

2064
02:28:05,472 --> 02:28:14,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they complained about the water and the driving just because you couldn't just, you couldn't speed down the street at, like, 200 miles a minute, you know?

2065
02:28:14,114 --> 02:28:17,214
[SPEAKER_12]: They claimed that that was also a problem with the game.

2066
02:28:17,234 --> 02:28:17,494
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2067
02:28:17,534 --> 02:28:17,974
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the game.

2068
02:28:17,994 --> 02:28:20,815
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, what else I want to get to is arcades.

2069
02:28:20,955 --> 02:28:22,155
[SPEAKER_12]: You asked about innovation.

2070
02:28:22,809 --> 02:28:28,233
[SPEAKER_12]: and I think that the way they'll probably be able to save it is virtual reality.

2071
02:28:28,654 --> 02:28:36,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Like some type of apparatus that I know they already have something like that but they need something where you'll have a group of people that'll stand in it and there'll be some type of multiplayer aspect.

2072
02:28:36,940 --> 02:28:41,824
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that multiplayer to the arcade will actually be something that might be able to save it.

2073
02:28:42,144 --> 02:28:42,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So the holodeck?

2074
02:28:44,065 --> 02:28:47,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, pretty much yeah, the holodeck.

2075
02:28:47,528 --> 02:28:48,729
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll save the arcades I think.

2076
02:28:49,205 --> 02:28:51,067
[SPEAKER_12]: or maybe even Motion Control.

2077
02:28:52,147 --> 02:29:08,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it kind of fascinating in a way that you're calling in to talk about saving arcades and you also kind of in the same sentence say MAG is the best game that you played last year because MAG is very interesting because it's not an MMO but you can't really call it just some multiplayer online game either.

2078
02:29:08,739 --> 02:29:11,662
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a, it's just, it's a brawl.

2079
02:29:12,162 --> 02:29:12,882
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

2080
02:29:14,564 --> 02:29:15,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's really great.

2081
02:29:15,845 --> 02:29:16,265
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think

2082
02:29:17,257 --> 02:29:23,340
[SPEAKER_12]: As far as first-person shooters go, that's the main reason why I like MAG was just because it's very innovative.

2083
02:29:23,380 --> 02:29:34,606
[SPEAKER_12]: They were doing something that you're not seeing in Call of Duty, that you're not even seeing in Halo, and I just can't believe how people just knock any type of new innovation that comes out of it.

2084
02:29:34,626 --> 02:29:46,592
[SPEAKER_12]: If the first-person shooter is not Call of Duty, they knock it down, and if the game isn't... What's the other big game that they have out there that people seem to

2085
02:29:47,862 --> 02:29:48,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Halo.

2086
02:29:49,023 --> 02:29:49,743
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm drawing a blank.

2087
02:29:50,584 --> 02:29:51,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, WoW, there you go.

2088
02:29:51,465 --> 02:29:53,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, if it's not WoW, it also gets shot down.

2089
02:29:53,406 --> 02:29:54,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Black Ops.

2090
02:29:54,307 --> 02:29:57,229
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like you could only... Yeah, it's like you could only make those two games.

2091
02:29:57,269 --> 02:30:03,333
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like you can only make Call of Duty for shooters and you can only make WoW for MMOs, you know?

2092
02:30:03,453 --> 02:30:05,775
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like the only two games in existence in people's minds.

2093
02:30:07,356 --> 02:30:08,977
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, don't get me wrong, I like WoW.

2094
02:30:09,157 --> 02:30:14,801
[SPEAKER_12]: I think WoW's great, but I've also played other MMOs and I think, you know, they should also get a chance, you know?

2095
02:30:14,941 --> 02:30:15,342
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're...

2096
02:30:16,502 --> 02:30:17,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Great games.

2097
02:30:17,783 --> 02:30:19,263
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just a gamer, period.

2098
02:30:19,583 --> 02:30:25,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there's a way to bring the magic of MAG and what makes that game exciting for you to an arcade?

2099
02:30:25,446 --> 02:30:31,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think that 64-player brawl experience is something you can really only do online and only ever do online?

2100
02:30:32,929 --> 02:30:33,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no.

2101
02:30:33,189 --> 02:30:35,890
[SPEAKER_12]: You can bring something like MAG to an arcade.

2102
02:30:36,130 --> 02:30:39,432
[SPEAKER_12]: You couldn't have 128 people versus 128 people.

2103
02:30:39,912 --> 02:30:43,053
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, you could probably have a little skirmish of maybe 400

2104
02:30:44,961 --> 02:30:45,361
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I agree.

2105
02:30:45,381 --> 02:30:45,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I agree with that.

2106
02:31:12,728 --> 02:31:14,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, my multiplayer is where it's at, man.

2107
02:31:14,469 --> 02:31:17,090
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to save the arcades if they want to save it.

2108
02:31:17,310 --> 02:31:21,071
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I gave up on arcades after Street Fighter 2 came out on PlayStation.

2109
02:31:21,431 --> 02:31:23,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, on Super Nintendo.

2110
02:31:23,912 --> 02:31:25,793
[SPEAKER_04]: As the old saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them.

2111
02:31:27,034 --> 02:31:27,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2112
02:31:27,734 --> 02:31:27,974
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2113
02:31:28,214 --> 02:31:29,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much for the call, buddy.

2114
02:31:29,575 --> 02:31:30,015
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good.

2115
02:31:30,235 --> 02:31:31,155
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

2116
02:31:31,535 --> 02:31:34,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask you your game of the year, but you already said you opened it up with Mag.

2117
02:31:34,556 --> 02:31:38,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So have fun fragging in Mag, and I hope Mag 2 is just as good, if not better.

2118
02:31:39,485 --> 02:31:40,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thanks a lot, man.

2119
02:31:40,166 --> 02:31:40,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2120
02:31:40,766 --> 02:31:41,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Try it.

2121
02:31:41,226 --> 02:31:42,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone who's listening, try Mag.

2122
02:31:42,747 --> 02:31:43,348

[SPEAKER_12]: Just try it.

2124
02:31:44,269 --> 02:31:44,989
[SPEAKER_12]: It's free?

2125
02:31:45,590 --> 02:31:46,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I like free.

2126
02:31:46,290 --> 02:31:47,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's something like that.

2127
02:31:47,471 --> 02:31:48,492
[SPEAKER_12]: You need PlayStation Plus.

2128
02:31:48,512 --> 02:31:52,955
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of crazy shit you have to do, but you can get the game for free if you don't want to buy it.

2129
02:31:53,351 --> 02:31:54,272
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll have to look into that.

2130
02:31:54,372 --> 02:31:55,073
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, take care, buddy.

2131
02:31:55,633 --> 02:31:55,853
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2132
02:31:57,014 --> 02:31:58,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like he works for the developer.

2133
02:31:58,976 --> 02:31:59,397
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

2134
02:31:59,697 --> 02:31:59,977
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2144
02:32:41,218 --> 02:32:44,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is ActDeft Hey ActDeft, haven't heard from you in a long time, what's up?

2145
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:50,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing much Just want to talk about some games Sure, what's up?

2146
02:32:52,075 --> 02:33:08,177
[SPEAKER_11]: have you tried or have any of you tried the Mexican wrestling game AAA Heroes del Dream I have not tried it and I'm going to assume the other folks in the studio probably haven't either but why don't you tell us all about it I think if we knew more about it I think Dan would play it

2147
02:33:11,104 --> 02:33:13,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's a pretty interesting game.

2148
02:33:15,245 --> 02:33:25,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, it's wrestling, but you have many professional Mexican wrestlers, and it's actually a pretty fun game to play on multiplayer.

2149
02:33:26,349 --> 02:33:26,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

2150
02:33:28,510 --> 02:33:31,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it like full on with all the theatrics and masks and everything?

2151
02:33:32,073 --> 02:33:32,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2152
02:33:32,493 --> 02:33:33,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's awesome.

2153
02:33:34,975 --> 02:33:39,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it actually captures all the Mexican wrestling thing.

2154
02:33:39,399 --> 02:33:45,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the action and all the things that happen on Mexican wrestling.

2155
02:33:45,384 --> 02:33:45,824
[SPEAKER_11]: The drama.

2156
02:33:46,625 --> 02:33:47,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the drama.

2157
02:33:48,966 --> 02:34:01,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, basically, even the audience plays a factor, well, plays in the game, not actually playing, but it plays a factor in the game.

2158
02:34:03,373 --> 02:34:06,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Was this the game you were telling us about previously that was actually developed in Mexico?

2159
02:34:07,901 --> 02:34:12,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it was developed by Mexicans and Colombians, I think.

2160
02:34:13,623 --> 02:34:19,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Though it was, I think, published by Konami in the United States.

2161
02:34:19,945 --> 02:34:20,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2162
02:34:20,966 --> 02:34:26,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of interesting things published by Konami, I know this is completely random, but I have to get that out at some point.

2163
02:34:26,568 --> 02:34:29,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at Dave & Buster's over the weekend, I think I mentioned.

2164
02:34:30,429 --> 02:34:35,955
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I played while I was there, it was a Wheel of Fortune ticket spitting machine where you guess the puzzle and everything.

2165
02:34:35,995 --> 02:34:36,856
[SPEAKER_04]: It was made by Konami.

2166
02:34:37,697 --> 02:34:38,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't believe it.

2167
02:34:38,458 --> 02:34:45,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize they had the license to do that type of thing, but they do a lot of arcade stuff, or redemption type of things, like slot machines and so forth.

2168
02:34:45,786 --> 02:34:47,247
[SPEAKER_09]: You said this was AAA?

2169
02:34:49,169 --> 02:34:52,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, she's looking at a video here in the studio right now of this game.

2170
02:34:55,467 --> 02:34:56,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this looks sick.

2171
02:34:58,550 --> 02:35:04,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Triple A, it's called, or Triple A. Okay, I think this is immediately awesome.

2172
02:35:04,995 --> 02:35:08,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just watching the intro of it.

2173
02:35:08,958 --> 02:35:09,478
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks really cool.

2174
02:35:09,498 --> 02:35:10,179
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely dramatic.

2175
02:35:10,219 --> 02:35:11,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the gameplay?

2176
02:35:11,220 --> 02:35:13,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I see that they have some over-the-top wrestlers.

2177
02:35:14,202 --> 02:35:15,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's the guy in the skeleton suit.

2178
02:35:15,803 --> 02:35:16,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.

2179
02:35:16,544 --> 02:35:17,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Little creepy.

2180
02:35:17,185 --> 02:35:18,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he's called La Parca.

2181
02:35:19,126 --> 02:35:20,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is sweet.

2182
02:35:22,418 --> 02:35:25,901
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is going to be getting her wrestling on pretty soon.

2183
02:35:26,001 --> 02:35:29,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually like wrestling games, believe it or not, because I like customizing a wrestler.

2184
02:35:30,905 --> 02:35:32,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that it's fun.

2185
02:35:32,727 --> 02:35:35,169
[SPEAKER_11]: If you like wrestling games, you're going to love this.

2186
02:35:35,629 --> 02:35:49,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we used to get all of the WWE ones, because the big thing about it is that because some of the publishing went overseas is that they actually have some of the big moves from some of the Japanese wrestlers.

2187
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:59,187
[SPEAKER_09]: and we would, you could actually unlock, like take all these different parts and recreate official, you know, Japanese wrestlers in it and it was really awesome.

2188
02:35:59,928 --> 02:36:02,069
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember, okay, do you remember WrestleMania 2000?

2189
02:36:03,831 --> 02:36:04,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Kinda.

2190
02:36:04,231 --> 02:36:04,732
[SPEAKER_09]: For the Nintendo 64?

2191
02:36:04,772 --> 02:36:04,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2192
02:36:07,412 --> 02:36:17,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I made this one wrestler who was a Degeneration X guy and we had him fight everybody just on the watch mode and he beat everybody including getting the women's belt.

2193
02:36:20,355 --> 02:36:26,176
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's what I like to do with those games is just make somebody and then just have them go in watch mode on all of the things.

2194
02:36:26,216 --> 02:36:27,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be fun.

2195
02:36:29,097 --> 02:36:34,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Actdeft, I got one more question for you and that would be what was the best game you played all last year using any criteria you want?

2196
02:36:36,099 --> 02:36:54,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't play that many games this year, well, last year, but I think one game that I really found interesting, it is BBBBBB, or 6B Ah yes, I heard you mention this in chat, what was so great about it?

2197
02:36:55,512 --> 02:36:57,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's actually a pretty simple game.

2198
02:36:58,034 --> 02:37:01,336
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a simple platformer.

2199
02:37:02,056 --> 02:37:09,742
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't jump, you don't do any spectacular things like in Mario or any platform like that.

2200
02:37:10,402 --> 02:37:11,403
[SPEAKER_11]: You control the gravity.

2201
02:37:11,863 --> 02:37:20,008
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go up or down, but you can't jump or can't move according to what you want to do.

2202
02:37:20,649 --> 02:37:23,631
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to calculate what you're going to do.

2203
02:37:23,671 --> 02:37:25,172
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're going to fall, you have to

2204
02:37:26,952 --> 02:37:37,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, be very lucky or somewhat skilled so you don't die because many of the rooms are filled with spikes.

2205
02:37:38,175 --> 02:37:41,435
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why it's called... Ah, got it.

2206
02:37:42,195 --> 02:37:42,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2207
02:37:43,376 --> 02:37:44,556
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also very cheap.

2208
02:37:44,616 --> 02:37:46,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's $5, I think.

2209
02:37:47,676 --> 02:37:50,097
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a pretty complete game.

2210
02:37:50,197 --> 02:37:53,358
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's the best game I played last year.

2211
02:37:54,338 --> 02:37:55,218
[SPEAKER_11]: SimpleJet Innovative.

2212
02:37:55,999 --> 02:37:57,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, great.

2213
02:37:57,921 --> 02:38:03,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I like hearing about some new games and things that, you know, maybe some of the rest of us missed, so I think that's a great pick.

2214
02:38:03,787 --> 02:38:06,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, buddy, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call.

2215
02:38:07,631 --> 02:38:08,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2216
02:38:08,171 --> 02:38:08,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care.

2217
02:38:10,151 --> 02:38:12,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2218
02:38:12,333 --> 02:38:14,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for calling.

2219
02:38:14,614 --> 02:38:15,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to those that didn't get through.

2220
02:38:16,135 --> 02:38:16,996
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always inevitable.

2221
02:38:17,216 --> 02:38:20,138
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't ring for like five minutes and then suddenly it's ringing off the hook at the end.

2222
02:38:21,318 --> 02:38:22,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Please feel free to email us your thoughts.

2223
02:38:22,739 --> 02:38:26,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Make DarkSakura do some work for next week.

2224
02:38:28,543 --> 02:38:31,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, all joking aside, we've got to wrap up the show and get out of here for the night.

2225
02:38:32,225 --> 02:38:34,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of us have to get back to work tomorrow bright and early.

2226
02:38:35,874 --> 02:38:40,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts since I believe we are done with the last minute stories tonight.

2227
02:38:40,720 --> 02:38:41,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Gary, thanks for being here.

2228
02:38:41,941 --> 02:38:52,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I know sadly you didn't get a whole lot of chance to shout at us with the news and everything with what's going on, but hey, have a great week and hope you get some more games and good luck with the tabletop adventures too.

2229
02:38:53,226 --> 02:38:53,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks.

2230
02:38:53,706 --> 02:38:54,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.

2231
02:38:54,406 --> 02:38:57,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wish I had more time to play video games.

2232
02:38:57,808 --> 02:38:58,908
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot going on right now.

2233
02:38:59,028 --> 02:39:03,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully I'll be able to get a hold of some more time and some more games in the future.

2234
02:39:03,890 --> 02:39:08,132
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I want to finish Batman Arkham Asylum before Arkham City comes out later this year.

2235
02:39:08,792 --> 02:39:11,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also wanted to try Transformers War for Cybertron.

2236
02:39:11,533 --> 02:39:12,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Still haven't gotten to that one yet either.

2237
02:39:13,073 --> 02:39:16,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you an assignment for the next time you come on the show at some point.

2238
02:39:16,595 --> 02:39:22,517
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to find us that tabletop game that you think is the most accessible to somebody who's been playing the types of games we play here.

2239
02:39:22,910 --> 02:39:26,212
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be a challenge, to say the least.

2240
02:39:26,252 --> 02:39:26,773
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2241
02:39:26,813 --> 02:39:27,453
[SPEAKER_04]: There's your homework.

2242
02:39:27,833 --> 02:39:28,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, accepted.

2243
02:39:29,374 --> 02:39:29,674
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2244
02:39:30,635 --> 02:39:31,556
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to DarkSakura.

2245
02:39:31,596 --> 02:39:33,957
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how you doing?

2246
02:39:34,197 --> 02:39:35,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a good first show of the year?

2247
02:39:35,638 --> 02:39:36,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so.

2248
02:39:36,339 --> 02:39:39,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I feel slightly more better.

2249
02:39:39,661 --> 02:39:41,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Her spirits have been elevated.

2250
02:39:41,142 --> 02:39:43,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

2251
02:39:43,864 --> 02:39:44,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Grr, arg.

2252
02:39:46,185 --> 02:39:49,628
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, I don't want to get up at 6 a.m.

2253
02:39:51,028 --> 02:39:51,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

2254
02:39:52,284 --> 02:39:53,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get up at 5 a.m.

2255
02:39:54,626 --> 02:39:55,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have to!

2256
02:39:55,427 --> 02:39:56,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow!

2257
02:39:56,208 --> 02:39:58,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Neither do I, but I do sympathize.

2258
02:39:59,191 --> 02:40:00,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually kind of wish I had your problem.

2259
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:03,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well that's it guys.

2260
02:40:03,209 --> 02:40:05,289
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

2261

[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much for downloading our show and checking us out.

2262
02:40:08,051 --> 02:40:13,013
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like what you hear, remember we do this completely for free and we don't ask anything but help us spread the word.

2263
02:40:13,553 --> 02:40:16,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Word of mouth is the only advertising we have here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2264
02:40:16,254 --> 02:40:21,777
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the way we've been doing it for nine years and we will continue to do it throughout the year and on into our tenth year in 2012.

2265
02:40:22,977 --> 02:40:24,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell two people about the show.

2266
02:40:24,538 --> 02:40:25,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us spread the word.

2267
02:40:25,699 --> 02:40:27,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave a nice review for us on iTunes.

2268
02:40:27,540 --> 02:40:28,560
[SPEAKER_04]: It all goes a long way.

2269
02:40:28,840 --> 02:40:30,021
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate it, guys.

2270

2273
02:40:37,065 --> 02:40:39,046

2274
02:40:39,426 --> 02:40:41,427
[SPEAKER_04]: 3DS coming up and so on.

2275
02:40:41,487 --> 02:40:42,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a busy year in games.

2276
02:40:43,128 --> 02:40:46,850
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be here to talk about them with you guys because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2277
02:40:46,870 --> 02:40:48,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Until then, bye.
