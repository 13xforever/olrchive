Tonight, January 2nd, 2011

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A popular SoCal arcade prepares to shut its doors

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A hype Japanese release underperforms

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And a classic Super Nintendo RPG makes its way to mobile phones

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are that show where every gamer has a voice

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Over the next few hours, we'll be talking to you about video games

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And gaming culture, gaming lifestyle, all that fun stuff

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A new year here at Orange Lounge Radio

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Our ninth year, if you can believe it, of broadcasting

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
From 2002 to 2011

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Rob Roberts

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And with me, as always, as she has been for nine damn years

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I hate that damn dragon

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're gonna get to that in a minute because everything, like, changed

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's like, it's like a new, is it technically a new decade now that it's 2011?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, so like, new decade, everything changed

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Seriously, I'm gonna get to that in a minute

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Nothing's changed, I brought this

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Tech master Loki over there, interjecting his opinion, yes

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, Tech Master Loki?

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, I brought soup a few weeks ago

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Remember, I had two large soups, I'm like, look, I have two soups

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But tonight you brought four soups

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, it wasn't intentional, I only wanted two

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Instead of two large soups, he has four smaller soups

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Which I think is still more soup than the, you know, it was before

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Alright, and that's value

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now, I do have to introduce, always with us, the fourth guest on the show

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Officially is our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Or we are on the IRC network on Game Surge

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you find that, gamesurge.net

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And we are in channel Orange Lounge

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If you want to do that, the real easy way, just go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But we do sometimes have guests in studio with us

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Just to hang out and have some fun with us

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Say hello to Gary is back tonight

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Happy New Year

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
How are you doing, Gary?

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm doing alright

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You haven't been here in a few months

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I seem to remember the last time you were here

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Loki was out, so you were kind of a fill-in hosty type deal

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, something like that

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're back tonight to kick off the new year with us here at OLR

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We were off for the holiday break and all the December events that were going on

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
DarkSakura loaded her car and went up to Washington

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How was your Washington trip, by the way?

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That fun, huh?

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It was alright, it was very...

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I watched a lot of the DIY network

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And Chiller, because they had a Buffy marathon

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Doesn't Chiller also run the Twin Peaks episodes?

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I have no idea, because I don't have cable

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
When did you watch on DIY?

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
House Movers, that was pretty cool

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I watched a lot of the home repair ones

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I learned the quick way to add in drywall

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Here comes Dan the man, the husband of DarkSakura, always present here

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Am I on here?

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes, you're on

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Before you listen to her bitch about it, she also got to drink ridiculously expensive wine

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I did

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And she got completely smashed with my dad, which was hilarious

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Your dad kept pouring me the wine

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And you kept drinking it

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And so did he

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Anyway

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And then he got an inversion table, so I'm drunk and upside down

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It was kinkier than it sounds, with my dad

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Shut up!

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You are a bastard

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Indeed

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He was a smooth pimp

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So before you let her go, oh, it sucked and I was bored

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I didn't say it sucked

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She had a good time

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She got to sleep the whole way there in the back

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I saw her vlogs, they were entertaining

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
DarkSakura is a vlogger now, with her little phones-y

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And disturbing

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And then Dan sitting there in the background like, hey, I'm Dan

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I talked more on a couple that we didn't upload

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, bummer

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, well, I'm out of here

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Alright, take care, Dan

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So yeah, we do occasionally talk about video games here on Orange Laundry Radio

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Video games, what the fuck?

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Since it is a new year, let me just kind of reset the stage for everybody

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If we happen to have any new listeners

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So we're hitting the reset button real quick

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Tell you a little bit about Orange Laundry Radio

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Orange Laundry Radio started in 2002

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have a college radio background and DarkSakura and I used to do stuff with another show called

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Undersedation Live, which is still up and running on the All Games Network on Saturday nights

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But we decided to start a show that was kind of talking smack about video games

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And what I mean by that is that DarkSakura, myself, and Loki

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We actually all met at a arcade locally here

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Playing, believe it or not, Dance Dance Revolution

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We used to be obsessed with that game

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I was never skinnier

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, no, no, no, Rob, Rob

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
For us, it was Parapara

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
A little bit of that, too, and Beatmania

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And a lot of those music-based video games

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So for a very long time, before there was even podcasting

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We had a show on Live 365 dedicated to music games

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And the music from them and so forth

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So things have evolved, podcasting happened

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And, you know, music games kind of faded out

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Then they came back in a different way

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And now they're kind of going, you know, things go up and down

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And kamami said no one would like them

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, so anyway, we're here

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Silly, silly people

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We're talking about kind of the rest of the video games

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Of course, we still have a fondness for music video games

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But we talk about role-playing games

127
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Meat

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Even first-person shooters

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And meat

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We might get to tonight

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And of course

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Meat

133
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Food games

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Iron Chef, for we

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to make a sandwich in a moment

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I'm going to make a turkey and cranberry sandwich

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And it's going to be amazing

138
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The secret ingredient, Iron Chef, the game is suck

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
All right, anyhow

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So that's our little show

141
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So welcome, thanks for joining us

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And of course, we do plug ourselves as the show

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Where every gamer has a voice

144
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And we do mean that, you know, this show was started with a bunch of us

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Kind of sitting around after a night at the arcade

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We used to go to this little restaurant called Brookfield's

147
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That was in the parking lot of the arcade where we all played at

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And we would have

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Old people food

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, but awesome mozzarella sticks

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So we'd always kind of dine on mozzarella sticks

152
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And talk smack about the games we just played

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So that's kind of what we try to emulate here

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Via our chat room, via the Skype line, via Twitter, via email

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Via Carrier Pigeon, if you can figure out how to get one here

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Rick's Glass of Merlot

157
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All right, anyhow

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's talk about games and your gaming week

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We were off last week because of Decemberween or whatever

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, Decemberween

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Whatever it is you celebrate

162
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Festivus, Christmas, Kwanzaa, all of it

163
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
All of it was an excuse to have last week off

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, I played a lot

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Actually, I played a lot of Mushihime Sama Bug Panic

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Thank you so much, Loki

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That game is so freaking fun

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And seriously, it's like mix of cave shooter and an adventure game

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And it's bullet hell on feet

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's fun, it's super fun

172
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And so I played a ton of that

173
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And I feel dirty

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I feel dirty, Rob

175
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Why? Why do you feel dirty?

176
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Wow

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
DarkSakura started playing World of Warcraft

178
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh my god, you guys

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's like a total turnaround from her stance two weeks ago

180
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And I gained 30 levels in four days

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay, so before everybody starts yelling at you

182
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Scab defector, you suck

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What is it, what's the magic that's there now that wasn't there for you last time?

184
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
More to do

185
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Shut up

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You get the hell out

187
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You get the hell out

188
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You are not on, no, no

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'd like to give an F you to Rob

190
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
For the whole fucking Warcraft thing

191
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm not having it in my house

192
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
She can play for a while

193
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then she's gonna get all addicted

194
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And I'm gonna get a fucking divorce

195
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's your fault, Rob

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's not my fault

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm gonna kill you

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Tiara plays too, blame her

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't like Tiara, oh I like her

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can get the hell out

201
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Should we call the police right now?

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There's about to be a domestic disturbance

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
At least it's all captured

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Here on the radio

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Dan was in here doing the happy dance

206
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
While I blithely flipped him off

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Alright

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It was funny

209
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It has more to do now, I guess

210
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Keep in mind, I love Star Trek Online

211
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I freaking love it

212
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But I was running out of stuff to do

213
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I was seriously getting bored

214
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And they'd put in episodes

215
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I would just wait and do

216
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
All of the portions of the episode

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
At once, and then I would be done with it

218
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And I'm like, okay, what do I do now?

219
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And even some of the missions are now broken

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And as much fun as I was having

221
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I was like, I'm kinda done

222
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What more can I do?

223
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So I thought that the changes were really exciting

224
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But really all I ever do is go in there

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Talk to my friends and play Dabo

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's it

227
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So I was like, you know

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The door of opportunity swung open

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I gave it a try

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Even after I was damn determined to play this game

231
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Because it did not want me to

232
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I defied

233
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Every power

234
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That tried to prevent me from playing this game

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Meaning?

236
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Meaning that my stupid

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The loader.exe was reading

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Badly with Windows

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So I had to rename it Bob

240
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And then it worked

241
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No seriously, I tried every freaking thing

242
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I ran safe mode with networking

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I did all of this crap

244
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And finally I'm like, fuck you, I'm naming you Bob

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And it worked

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wasn't there a program back in the day called Microsoft Bob?

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I have no idea

248
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Isn't that like the reason we have Comic Sans in the world now?

249
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Ooh, yeah

250
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
By the way, I've gotta go to our chat room

251
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You know they are the always present guests here on the show

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
They're not allowed to talk

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Black Wolf, addict

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Act Deft, sell out

255
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Bojigawa, addict

256
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Jesus, let's just pop in our chat room

257
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I was fine with my spouse's

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Sleeping pill and QVC addiction

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I will not abide World of Warcraft in this marriage

260
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Wow

261
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Well I think, is he trying to say that you're addicted

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Alan Hart

263
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Is he trying to say that you're addicted to sleeping pills and QVC?

264
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I am not

265
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Dan admitted to me earlier today

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That he used to stay up late

267
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
In his high school years

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Watching the Home Shopping Network

269
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What other good shit about

270
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I was in fifth grade

271
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And I stayed up all night watching Home Shopping Network

272
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Because I was up late

273
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And it made me feel like somebody was up with me

274
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So I wouldn't be lonely

275
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Pathetic, huh?

276
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And it's hilarious because they're so stupid

277
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I love watching them sell a computer

278
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You press this button

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And it does stuff

280
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It comes with a free printer

281
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Didn't know your show was going to be a confessional tonight

282
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I know, it's like

283
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We're cleaning the slate for New Years

284
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's a confessional tonight on Orange Lounge Radio

285
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Get everything off your chest

286
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So that this new decade

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Can be a relieving one

288
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Amen to that

289
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But, well I am going to say

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That I have now made it from

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
One side of the continent

292
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
To the other

293
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
On whatever freaking continent that is that you took me to

294
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Actually, first of all

295
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You took me to this giant tree

296
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And then I jumped off, died

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And then respawned at the bottom of the tree

298
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So that I wouldn't have to figure out how to get off of it

299
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And then just ran across the water

300
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And then I've been

301
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Running all over the continent

302
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And it's been kind of fun because I've actually kind of

303
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Been getting into the story

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And getting into the lore of the game

305
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's been, now that I'm actually

306
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Getting to see more of the story

307
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Because that was one of the big things that I liked about Star Trek Online

308
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
As I was going through

309
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
All of the ranks and stuff

310
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You get more of the story and I was like

311
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Well it's really fitting in well with Star Trek Universe

312
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And then I just got to this point like

313
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What? Why are we fighting the Davidians?

314
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They were the lamest

315
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Brain sucking

316
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Interdimensional creatures ever

317
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It really

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Except that they gave me the cool Silent Hill thing

319
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So that was cool but

320
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I accidentally ran into an instance and got killed

321
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That has to happen at least once I think

322
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It was the one that was underwater

323
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Like with all the underwater people

324
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Sounds like Black Fathom depths

325
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That was it

326
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That was it

327
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh it's sad I know that

328
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And now I'm in some place called the Battle Scar

329
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And I couldn't find the damn flag

330
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And then I just gained a level

331
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Congrats, so what level are you now?

332
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I know you're gonna do it

333
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
37

334
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
In a row?

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But I think I've done okay

336
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
For myself because I've gotten there

337
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
In technically

338
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Six days of playing

339
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Right?

340
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You've been jamming right along

341
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Bochi Kawa in our chatroom says

342
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Everyone jumps off of Teladrasil, it's normal

343
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Is it like the Golden Gate?

344
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Lumi's in our chatroom says

345
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I hope we have another

346
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I Slept with a Forum Troll reveal

347
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't know

348
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Gary, have you ever slept with a forum troll?

349
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No

350
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well we had a guest a couple weeks ago that

351
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Apparently had so

352
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The only thing that forum trolls

353
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Are fit for is machine gun targets

354
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Alright

355
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Seriously though

356
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But I got a melodica

357
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Which has nothing to do with games but I love Marisa forever

358
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Would you learn how to play Still Alive on the melodica

359
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And play it for us one night?

360
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Wow that was random

361
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I could probably figure it out over the course of the show

362
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's okay we don't need to hear you rehearsing

363
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Throughout the next three hours

364
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If you have nothing else gaming to report

365
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No I did other stuff

366
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I remember so fucking

367
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We've had a bunch of maim going on in the front room all day

368
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I heard they were playing Moonwalker when we got here

369
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Because all I could hear was

370
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

371
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No no wait I had to go

372
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Ouch

373
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And yeah

374
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
They've had the maim fest going on

375
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And Dan has a new steering wheel

376
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
For Gran Turismo 5

377
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm never gonna call

378
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Wow Player an addict again

379
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm gonna call Dan an addict

380
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's a Bobby Blackpool

381
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Joke

382
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Bobby is convinced that Gran Turismo 5 is not out

383
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Because he's not seen it on a store shelf anywhere

384
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But your husband somehow has it

385
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You know what I can verify that it is out

386
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Because sometimes I hear Dan yelling at it

387
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That though

388
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And the biggest thing that I'm gonna give it

389
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Is that it has the top gear track

390
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And it has the Stig

391
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So it's instantly

392
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
In my cool book forever

393
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Because I freaking love the Stig

394
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He listens to all kinds of interesting music

395
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And he may or may not be an alien

396
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Okay

397
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Let's go to Loki

398
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Loki how was your gaming week?

399
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It was okay

400
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I didn't play a whole lot

401
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Just playing the same stuff

402
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I've been working on Grand Theft Auto stuff

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Just doing construction stuff

404
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
With the mods

405
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Then also of course

406
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I've been playing some

407
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
iPod games

408
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Including

409
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Some of these aren't exactly new

410
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Actually most of these aren't new

411
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But they're very similar types of games

412
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Cannibalt and I Must Run

413
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Both actually pretty much similar to Cannibalt

414
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Based off the Flash game

415
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Where you run and have to jump over pits

416
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And stuff like that without dying

417
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And keeps getting faster and faster

418
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I Must Run they try to add kind of a story to it

419
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And it's kind of neat

420
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And I like the presentation of it

421
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's like some time traveling game

422
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That sort of reminds me of the art style

423
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Of like Feel the Magic

424
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So that's kind of cool

425
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And then

426
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Also played

427
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
More Swords and Poker 2

428
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Which unfortunately is not on

429
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The app store anymore

430
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The first one, Swords and Poker 1

431
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But thankfully though

432
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I have a jailbroken iPod

433
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So I don't have that problem

434
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I'm glad

435
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Because those games are very addicting

436
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And then also

437
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't know if you noticed

438
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But there was

439
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Some new stuff actually coming on

440
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The app store

441
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It was pretty cool

442
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They had one of the

443
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Tails games actually

444
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Is now on the app store

445
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So if you're a fan of that series

446
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You might want to check that out

447
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It was a Super NES Tails game

448
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It was

449
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Let's see here

450
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Which Tails game was it?

451
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Tails

452
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I guess

453
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Tails of Weaver

454
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Lucian Cult

455
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But I guess it's based on the MMORPG

456
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But it looks like

457
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
A nice 16-bit RPG

458
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You know

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I will say even though you've been kind of slowly

460
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Going this way over the past six months

461
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Maybe the biggest change for 2011 isn't the fact

462
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That Loki is not bringing bacon

463
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Pizza to the show but the fact that

464
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I would have never said two years ago

465
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That Loki would be the one here reviewing games that are out on the

466
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
iTouch

467
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Call me crazy but if you've listened to Loki's

468
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Diatribes in the past on Apple

469
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I've already told you though

470
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I understand

471
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's still a little bizarre

472
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's max not the i things

473
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
See the i things

474
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
They are expensive but they're good

475
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And the max

476
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The max are fucking expensive

477
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
They're not good

478
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You don't get very good value for what you

479
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Purchase

480
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I would hope that if I'm spending $2,000

481
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
On a laptop that I'm getting something

482
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
More than just one USB drive

483
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't care if it's paper thin

484
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I want a fucking computer that can do something

485
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's just my opinion

486
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But hey you know what

487
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Teach their own and some people will buy

488
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Max stuff forever and honestly

489
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I spent no money on this

490
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I had a stupid gift card that they gave me

491
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It was either that or

492
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Buying a bunch of Apple TV's

493
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That throw out a window or something

494
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I will say that max are still

495
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Great for the graphics but now

496
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That Adobe's figured out that

497
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
There's really a lot of PC users out there

498
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I have no need

499
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
To have a Mac anymore

500
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
They have pretty monitors

501
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But those monitors have their old

502
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
God I want one of those gorgeous

503
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Gigantor monitors

504
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh my god that would be so amazing

505
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I would need new underwear every day

506
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
They're pretty nice

507
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Our graphics department has

508
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Some of those and they're nice

509
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But once again it's a monitor

510
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And I'm sure that monitor is way overpriced

511
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
For what it is

512
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So I just

513
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I could buy a TV and hook it up

514
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And it would cost less than the monitor

515
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
See like I have my

516
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
iPod which I can browse the web

517
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And stuff if I have a wifi spot

518
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And I have my phone which you know I can

519
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Browse the web too with that but honestly

520
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I hate my phone's web browser

521
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's terrible and it's

522
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Slow

523
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I have an Android phone

524
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But it's

525
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's a virgin mobile prepaid

526
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Android phone

527
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't think it's like a super android

528
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Android that plays snake

529
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes

530
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But it is an

531
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Android that I was able to root and

532
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Add a thing to

533
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Allow me to tether

534
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
To it so I just tether this

535
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
To it and I'm able to browse the web

536
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And I love it and it's great

537
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And I use this actually a lot now

538
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
To you know browse the web and check

539
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
My mail or whatever instead of

540
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Having to go to my computer boot it up and do

541
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
All that stuff and then just it's a lot

542
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Quicker I just do it on here

543
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But see that's the only thing I have I like going for

544
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It cause I mean this is

545
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Arguably the top

546
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
There's no I mean Zune's

547
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
They're alright but there's no

548
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes but there's no like

549
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You know there's not really

550
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Any iPod

551
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Competitors out there that are kind of close to it right now

552
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Can't say the same though for Max

553
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Max I'm sorry it's just there's

554
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
There's competitors everywhere and they're just beating the

555
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Crap out of them

556
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Other computers are you know they've

557
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Gotten the form factor really small but

558
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm sorry it's just

559
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's not important to me

560
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So Loki would you say

561
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The description of a Mac is an overpriced fashion

562
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Accessory true or false

563
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Or something else

564
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
They buy into the brand and not

565
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Necessarily it's for people

566
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
They've

567
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Kind of marketed them as PCs

568
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
They're easy to use or laptops

569
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They're easy to use and it's they're kind of

570
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
People don't want to try to

571
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Learn stuff and they trust the

572
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Apple brand because it's been around forever

573
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And unfortunately people are willing

574
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
To spend a lot of money for that

575
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This is the impression I get and I'm probably going to piss some

576
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Mac fans off but you know oh well

577
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I had an Apple

578
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Laptop it only lasted me a year but

579
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I had it but anyway

580
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I kind of get the sense that

581
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Apple a lot of their systems

582
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Why I don't know why we've turned into this Mac versus PC

583
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
War but

584
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Really preference I mean if you want to buy one

585
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Go ahead but Macs are kind of like PC

586
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Consoles to me and I think sometimes that's the

587
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Advantage of them is that a lot of the software is

588
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Very much customized for the Mac

589
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Because their library is

590
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
A little more limited than what you see on the PC

591
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And the expandability and

592
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Customizability well yes I understand you can do some

593
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Of it with Apple they're not all over the

594
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Fucking map like PCs are like

595
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
There's zillions and zillions of

596
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Different types of PCs but there's only so many types

597
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Of Macs and I think the software

598
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
By nature kind of is

599
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
A little more optimized and runs a little better

600
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
On Macs the app store coming to the Mac

601
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Is a great idea because

602
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You know at least then you have a lot of

603
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Different programs and tools and stuff that people

604
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Can just fill

605
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Their computer with like I have with my

606
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
iPod so

607
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I think that's a good idea and they'll really fit with it

608
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But once again it's basically just

609
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Like hey look it's just a more expensive

610
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
iPad or something now it's a computer

611
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
iPad you know

612
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I don't know it's just but iPads

613
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Are so cute last time I used

614
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Anything from Apple it crashed on me

615
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I don't know

616
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Alright well let's get let's get off the Apple

617
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
PC stuff and continue with our gaming

618
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Weeks I don't know if Loki has anything else

619
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But if no just grant them though but I don't we

620
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Don't need well what else is new let's go over to

621
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Gary what types of video games you've been

622
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Playing lately

623
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Well Dark Sakura's husband's been

624
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Kicking my ass thoroughly on Street Fighter

625
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
For Super Turbo

626
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes well

627
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That goes without saying I just started

628
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Playing it thank you I just said that

629
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I can't that he can't help that he's

630
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Not good at it that's because I haven't played it

631
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Since I was in junior high thank you

632
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And I've

633
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Also yeah yeah yeah

634
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I also just started playing Batman Arkham

635
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Asylum finally

636
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Which the graphics are wow

637
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And yeah

638
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I know I'm trying to come lately to that party but

639
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's still something I haven't

640
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Attached the game oh okay

641
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Well I feel a little bit better but still

642
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's a fun

643
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Game I'm told that you can beat it in about

644
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Eight hours if you if you're dedicated but

645
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll drag it out and enjoy it

646
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
As long as I can so

647
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But yeah I

648
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Recently acquired an Xbox 360

649
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So and that's been

650
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That's been a lot of fun

651
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And I'm quite impressed I also got a

652
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
A Samsung

653
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Phone with windows on

654
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It and I noticed it has the Xbox Live

655
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Application

656
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I have yet to go through the catalog

657
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And see what games are available to download

658
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I think I saw Tetris as one of them

659
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That's been a big thing they're pushing lately is that the

660
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Whole achievements from your phone and all that

661
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Pretty good

662
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You know what's kind of cool and I kind of

663
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Off subject here real quick but we were talking about

664
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh I was talking about my phone

665
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
One thing I like and this is something

666
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That I wish that they would do with like

667
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Steam and stuff is the Android

668
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Marketplace say you buy an

669
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
App or something like from them and it either

670
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Sucks or it doesn't work

671
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You can get your money back

672
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And uninstall

673
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Nice yes I mean

674
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's awesome

675
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
They should really have that

676
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I haven't paid for any apps on this

677
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
On the windows phone yet the only ones I've got

678
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I've downloaded were free so

679
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But you know we'll see what happens

680
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
With that I like it so far

681
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But

682
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Time will tell the battery doesn't last

683
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
For anything but I'm told that's normal

684
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah with a lot of smart phones

685
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
They don't always last very long

686
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
My iPhone lasts forever

687
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Well the more you're online the more you do

688
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The GPS enabled stuff

689
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Of course that's all going to be a battery drain

690
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So you just want to make sure you're not running anything in the background

691
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
We were running the MP3 players

692
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
From here to Washington and didn't lose

693
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And didn't use up the whole battery

694
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Surprisingly enough MP3 really doesn't use that much battery

695
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And I was

696
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Using and Facebooking the entire way too

697
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It only uses up a lot of battery

698
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
If you continuously skip through songs

699
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I've noticed if you just let it play

700
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yeah it'll go forever

701
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So

702
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Well anything else for your gaming week you wish to share with us Gary?

703
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh just

704
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
A lot of tabletop D&D

705
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Ah that's right

706
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You're into the old school types of games

707
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Not really old school

708
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But I like me some Final Fantasy 2

709
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And I've got a hold of Final Fantasy 13

710
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And haven't had a chance to start it yet

711
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Because I'm still one thing at a time

712
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And for the tabletop fans out there

713
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Because I know there's always a few

714
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
There's always a little bit of crossover between the video gaming circles and tabletop gaming circles

715
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What are your tabletop games of choice right now?

716
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Um

717
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I was playing

718
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I've been playing D&D since 2000

719
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So I'm kind of getting burnt out on fantasy

720
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm looking at Hero System

721
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm looking at Mutants and Masterminds

722
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
From Green Ronin

723
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Which just recently released

724
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
A DC Heroes

725
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Roleplaying game based on the Mutants and Masterminds system

726
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Last fall

727
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And they're going to put out the third edition of Mutants and Masterminds

728
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Very very shortly

729
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I haven't only gotten to play it once or twice

730
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But I'm told by people who have played it

731
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's an awesome system

732
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I have a little bit more experience with Hero

733
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Which is a lot more complicated

734
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Alright

735
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Speaking of DC there's a big new game coming out soon

736
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The DC Universe Online is out in about

737
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
One, two weeks

738
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
From that it looks awesome

739
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah I've played the beta on the PC

740
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's good times

741
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's a little bit like if Ninja Turtles was an MMO

742
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Because it is a lot of beat-em-up

743
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It does come with a month of free play

744
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Well that's customary, of course

745
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So we'll see

746
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'll have to look into that one

747
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Alright

748
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Well anyway, my gaming week

749
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I want to talk about a few things with my gaming week

750
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm kind of like Gary

751
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I was kicking it old school a little bit

752
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I wanted to buy two used games and get one free

753
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
One of them isn't old

754
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I bought Tron Evolution

755
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Which is the game that came out

756
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
To support the new Tron movie, Tron Legacy

757
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I bought that on the Playstation 3

758
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And I played this at E3 and I was somewhat

759
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Encouraged by what I saw

760
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
With the whole Prince of Persia style fighting

761
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And you know

762
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I was seeing the light bike races

763
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
On another screen, although that ended up really being

764
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The Wii version

765
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So I played the Tron game

766
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And it sucks, I hate it

767
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm really disappointed because

768
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Tron deserves a better game than this

769
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And I'm sorry to say it

770
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It was clearly

771
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Clearly rushed to make

772
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The movie release

773
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And this shit always happens with games based on movies

774
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And that's why none of them are ever any good

775
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I should say, rarely are they good

776
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And unfortunately it just falls in that same bin

777
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Where the best part about it was the

778
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Daft Punk soundtrack in the beginning

779
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's hard to hear that

780
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Because it deserves better

781
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And there's so much more they could do with the Tron mythos

782
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I will say this, the story

783
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Is kind of the coolest part

784
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And what I liked is that some of it

785
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Would parallel scenes in the movie

786
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And without giving it all away

787
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Because I don't want to tell you about the whole plot

788
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But I will say it's supposed to

789
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Explain what happened between the first movie

790
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And the new movie

791
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And the new movie does some of that flashback as well

792
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So there is overlap

793
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
With the flashback scene which you see in the movie

794
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And what you play in the game

795
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Honestly, I think I'm just going to go on YouTube

796
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And try to find a compilation of all the cut scenes from the game

797
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
There will be more Tron games

798
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's inevitable

799
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I wish they'd be better

800
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
This is what ruined the game for me

801
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
What absolutely ruined the game for me

802
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Was in one sequence

803
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I finally got through the first level

804
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And I got to the sequence where you're on light bikes

805
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And I was like, fuck yes!

806
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I get to do the light bike races

807
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Because that was one of the coolest fucking things in the movie

808
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm doing spirals and up the hills

809
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah, you know

810
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And I'm doing the light bikes and they control

811
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Like, butt

812
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And I crashed my light cycle

813
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I shit you not, like seven times

814
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And the whole acceleration, deceleration

815
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Doesn't really flow

816
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And there's this part where you are supposed to do this big jump

817
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But if you haven't accelerated enough

818
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You don't make the jump

819
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm literally sitting there going

820
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Did anybody play this game

821
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
To see if it was fun

822
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Because it's not fun

823
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And that is so frustrating

824
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Because it's Tron

825
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's fucking Tron

826
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And it deserves to be so much better

827
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I was so mad

828
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I will tell you this

829
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Do not, do not spend $60 on this game

830
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Do spend 99 cents on the iPhone game

831
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That's out there because it's a better experience

832
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Dude, I have that, it's great

833
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That was the other thing that I was trying to remember when I played

834
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That game is fun

835
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But you did see the movie, right?

836
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I fucking love the movie

837
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Well you know that they're doing it twice

838
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
They're doing like a Clone Wars thing with it

839
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Where they're going to have an animated series

840
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That's going to be between the first and second movies

841
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah, that sounds interesting

842
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You should totally read the comics by the way

843
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The Tron, the betrayal

844
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
They're really good

845
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I wonder if there's any overlap with that in the game as well

846
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But let me tell you, here's some of my problems with the game you guys

847
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because you know, I'm sitting here when it stinks

848
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The thing is that

849
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
A lot of the combat feels like really repetitive

850
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And there's some frame rate issues

851
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
When like, you know, you're throwing the disc

852
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It just kind of seems to like

853
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Bounce all over the screen in random frames

854
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The multiplayer

855
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Like, what would you think multiplayer would be in Tron?

856
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What would you think would be the first thing

857
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You're going to go into in a multiplayer in Tron?

858
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Anybody?

859
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Don't you think? No

860
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Nope, it's a battle arena

861
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's not the disc thing, it's just 20 people

862
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
In a big clusterfuck arena

863
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
All de-rezzing each other

864
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
There were no light cycles up front

865
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Not that I could find easily

866
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I could have sworn I read it's like in there

867
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But I was like cycling, I don't know if it's something you have to buy

868
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Later on or what

869
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But I was cycling through the stuff

870
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I didn't find that mode to play

871
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So either I'm a complete moron or the game was not well designed

872
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Because I could not find it

873
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Because I'm thinking, if you're trying to sell a game to Tron fans

874
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You would put that light cycle, the tanks

875
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
All that shit would be front and center

876
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You know what I mean? And it's not

877
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I went into this ultra lame

878
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
20 people all throwing discs at each other

879
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Or the light jets

880
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That would have been cool

881
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Or the little mosquito looking guys in the movie

882
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It was awesome

883
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Wyland in our chatroom says

884
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Play a real Tron game, play 2.0

885
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You know what? I've heard a lot of good things

886
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
About that game and I probably should

887
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You're probably right

888
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I was going to ask you about that

889
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Were there any other Tron games that came out before the movie?

890
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Besides 2.0?

891
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Just Tron 2.0

892
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That I know of

893
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And that's not counting any fan stuff

894
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Because the Tron sequel has been in development

895
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
For quite some time

896
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
From what I understand

897
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So there's been an absence of Tron things

898
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I mean not counting

899
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Xbox Live Marketplace

900
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Had rehashes of the Tron

901
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I don't think you can get them anymore

902
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Because of license issues

903
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
If you don't count that

904
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
This is where it gets awesome

905
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Tron deadly discs

906
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And Wyland just wants to say

907
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah 2.0 is far far better

908
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Than evolution

909
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And Tigerclaw says Sky light cycles are in there

910
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I think it's the RB button that puts you in light cycle mode

911
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Well I mean I know light cycles

912
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Were like in the game but is it multiplayer?

913
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Because when I was like circling around the different arenas

914
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It was all different types of

915
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Melee

916
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So whatever I mean

917
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Call me an idiot if you want

918
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But the fact that I couldn't find that very easy

919
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I think speaks for itself

920
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah

921
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Anyhow

922
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Unfortunately if you must

923
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Rent Tron for the story

924
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Do not do not spend 50 or 60 dollars

925
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Just go to the Tron wiki

926
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I've already read the whole thing on the Tron wiki

927
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Well I mean it's nice to see it

928
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Like it's fun to see the movie

929
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Rent it

930
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's at most worth a $5 rental

931
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And you could probably play through it a weekend

932
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Or

933
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Most red boxes nowadays do have game rentals

934
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
As well you can rent it for one day

935
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
For like two bucks

936
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
There you go

937
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
From what you were saying that sounds like about all it's worth

938
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So I'm gonna move up the scale

939
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
In games I played this week

940
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So here's the next game I played

941
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
White Knight Chronicles came out in 08

942
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's like a level 5 game for the Playstation 3

943
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
What was it? Final Fantasy 11

944
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The offline version almost

945
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Well here's the thing

946
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm not sure what the fuck this game is

947
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Like and that's

948
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
The weird thing about it

949
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Like I kind of feel like White Knight Chronicles

950
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Is one of those games where

951
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It has a bit of an identity crisis

952
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Where they try to do so much with it

953
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That they have a lot in the game

954
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But it doesn't do any of it exceedingly well

955
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And it's not that I dislike the game

956
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's been interesting to me enough

957
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Where I've sank like 4 hours in it so far

958
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But

959
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I don't know

960
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Let me kind of set the stage for you

961
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's kind of your typical like

962
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You've been kidnapped and you gotta go find her

963
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Type of thing

964
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You create this character in the beginning of the game

965
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And your character does nothing in the story

966
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Your character literally stands there

967
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Next to the main character

968
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
While everything is playing out

969
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Which is really weird right?

970
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So ok whatever

971
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The main character and his little lackey

972
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You go off on the adventures

973
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And you know you're killing things

974
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And the battle system is the closest thing I could compare it to

975
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Is like Final Fantasy 12

976
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Because you can kind of do like live attacks

977
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And things and the coolest part was that you can create

978
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Combos based on your class

979
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And you can kind of like string these

980
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Combos together that you've created

981
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And so it's kind of cool

982
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Like I like that

983
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And you go out in the fields and you know

984
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Fight some monsters just go from one place to the other

985
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And all the monsters you see on the map

986
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You start to get some frame rate issues

987
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
In some areas which are on the Playstation 3

988
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Which is supposed to be this uber piece of technology

989
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Is a little bit

990
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But whatever you know you kind of look past that

991
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And go forward

992
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And then

993
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
After about a couple hours into the story it says

994
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
By the way there's this whole GeoNet thing

995
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You can hook up online

996
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And play with other people and get quests

997
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And do this stuff together

998
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And so I'm like oh maybe that's why your character

999
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Has been a lackey this whole time

1000
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Because that's like really going to be your online character

1001
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Even though they had nothing to do with the single player mode

1002
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
This character is going to be like

1003
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Your little online person

1004
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And I don't know

1005
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And then the game starts to feel like

1006
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Now I'm playing Phantasy Star Universe

1007
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
There's all these quests

1008
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That you can kind of do and there's recommended levels

1009
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And you go out in the field

1010
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And do your goal like it really kind of felt like

1011
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Phantasy Star Universe

1012
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Where you play the single player for a little while

1013
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And then all of a sudden it's like oh hey it's a multiplayer game too

1014
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So it's really weird

1015
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I don't know how else to explain it

1016
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And sometimes the camera

1017
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Can kind of bug and sometimes

1018
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You know the battle system

1019
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Starts to feel a little bit like okay

1020
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Like could I gain my little powers

1021
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
A little faster so I could do the cool stuff

1022
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
More often because right now this feels very slow moving

1023
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So yeah White Knight Chronicles

1024
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
A bit of an identity crisis

1025
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I didn't hate it

1026
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't love it

1027
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I like it but I have a really difficult time

1028
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Explaining to anybody

1029
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
What the game is

1030
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So your rating in a nutshell is just what meh?

1031
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think if you like

1032
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Japanese RPG type of games

1033
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And you like the more actiony

1034
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Based ones like you like Phantasy Star

1035
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Online

1036
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's not press X to swing your sword

1037
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It's a little more active time battle than that

1038
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But if you kind of like

1039
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That sort of idea then I think you'd like it

1040
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And if you like your grind fest

1041
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I think it would be permissible

1042
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And especially now that you can find it most places

1043
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Like 30, 35 bucks

1044
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
That's a fair price to pay

1045
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Considering it has a pretty robust online mode

1046
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's a fee for

1047
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So I'll give it that

1048
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And I guess there's a sequel that came out in Japan

1049
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But I don't think it's coming out here

1050
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Because unfortunately I do not believe the game did too well

1051
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So there you go

1052
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah so that was the

1053
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That was the weird thing

1054
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Then I played

1055
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Fallout 3

1056
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I was partying like it was 2008

1057
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
But I finally got a hold of this game

1058
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
On the used game sale

1059
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And yeah I think the people describing it

1060
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
With guns, really good

1061
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Great story though

1062
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I was totally into it in the beginning

1063
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I think they do a great job kind of setting the stage

1064
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
As you're doing that whole like baby

1065
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
To child to adult

1066
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And all that

1067
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't want to spoil anything even though the game is like years old now

1068
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But you know it's kind of like

1069
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
How you get to where you are in the story

1070
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And why you're in a nuclear wasteland

1071
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And all this stuff

1072
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And yeah the only unfortunate thing about it

1073
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Is that if you don't save often

1074
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
The NPC you might have wanted to do a quest for

1075
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Will end up dead and now you can't do that quest

1076
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So uh

1077
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Save now, save often

1078
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That's really the only terrible thing I can think about it

1079
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Otherwise I gotta say

1080
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Another reason why I really like this game

1081
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Is that it's not just that it's like first person shooter

1082
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But you can use some of like your little power

1083
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
By hitting the right bumper

1084
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
To go into like this like

1085
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Focus attack mode

1086
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Where if I suck at first person shooters

1087
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
At least if I'm like kind of like stealthy enough

1088
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
At second person points

1089
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I can still shoot someone in the head with a very accurate shot

1090
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Because it basically stops the game

1091
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And you can focus on a part of the body

1092
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And it tells you the percentage

1093
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Yeah a little bit

1094
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Because it tells you like the percentage of success

1095
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So I thought that was kind of neat

1096
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So uh yeah

1097
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I like Fallout and it's a beautiful game

1098
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And there's so much to it

1099
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And if you have the game of the year edition

1100
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You just have quests upon quests upon quests

1101
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So uh yeah

1102
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
My Fallout 3

1103
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Um let's see

1104
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Something else I want to talk about

1105
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I've had 11 days in a row off of work

1106
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Because at my work we take the entire time

1107
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Between Christmas and New Years off

1108
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It's like a PTO thing I won't get into details

1109
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
That's what we do

1110
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So I've had 11 days to kind of you know play some games

1111
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And so forth

1112
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
One day I decided you know what

1113
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm gonna watch The Tester season 2

1114
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm gonna just download every single episode

1115
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm gonna watch the whole damn thing

1116
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Yeah sure me

1117
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Has sure me's bowels been voided

1118
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Okay sure me's asleep so hopefully she won't hear me

1119
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Talking about this

1120
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I gotta admit something you guys

1121
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It was actually a pretty good show

1122
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Like it was better than the first season

1123
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
What I watched of it

1124
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I think the show

1125
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Now here's the show if you haven't heard of it

1126
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You can only download the show

1127
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
It's only available on PlayStation Network

1128
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And it's a show about people that are

1129
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Imagine it's The Apprentice

1130
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The Donald Trump Show you're fired

1131
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But it's with video games and the ultimate job is to become

1132
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
The PlayStation Tester

1133
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Which is why this show is getting a lot of shit

1134
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Because what a glamorous job game testing is

1135
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Right?

1136
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But what I like about the show

1137
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
What I ended up ultimately liking about it

1138
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Was that you know

1139
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It didn't really hide the fact

1140
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That none of these people

1141
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Really had the goal of being a PlayStation Tester

1142
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
A lot of them said

1143
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Fully self aware

1144
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I want this job to get my foot in the door

1145
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So I can work with these people

1146
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
To work my way up

1147
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And like this one girl

1148
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
She even says in one episode

1149
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You know what? I don't even own a PlayStation 3

1150
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I want to make games for children

1151
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And you might kind of look at that and go

1152
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
What? You don't even own a PlayStation 3? What the hell are you doing on this show?

1153
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But I kind of looked at that going

1154
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That's really kind of honest of Sony to have in there

1155
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Because if you think everybody that's working

1156
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
In the video game industry right now

1157
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Grew up on video games

1158
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And I had a pickup call coming

1159
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And so I thought it was a very kind of like honest response

1160
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And another guy had said

1161
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You know what? I want to do this so I can get into PR

1162
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And yeah

1163
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So it seemed like everybody that was kind of on the show

1164
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Like actually really wanted to be there

1165
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And I have to admit

1166
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I can't remember the last time I saw a reality show

1167
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Where by the time it was down to the last episode

1168
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
The final three people

1169
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Like I would have been happy with any single one of them winning

1170
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Ultimately the person that won

1171
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I thought was a

1172
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Person that was really going to use

1173
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Their potential and so forth

1174
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
But I would have been happy if Sony really

1175
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Ended up hiring any of them

1176
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Because I thought they kind of told a good story

1177
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So when I say like

1178
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Oh my gosh you should drop everything you're doing and watch this show

1179
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
No

1180
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I mean like really I should have been trying to catch up on

1181
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
True Blood or some other show

1182
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't know why I was watching this

1183
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But if you're surfing around the channels

1184
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And you're watching reruns of Cops on G4

1185
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Or you're watching some of this other garbage that's on TV

1186
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Like honestly the tester

1187
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's not that bad

1188
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You know it's not like

1189
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
They are

1190
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's interesting because

1191
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You're going to look at some of the like types of challenges

1192
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
They do and so forth and like you're like

1193
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
What does this have to do with game testing

1194
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Does it have anything to do with game testing

1195
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But it's TV

1196
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Look at The Apprentice

1197
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
What does a lot of the crap they do on that show have to do with

1198
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Actually running a company

1199
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Not a lot but usually there's that one little

1200
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Tip in it

1201
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
That is kind of the focus of the episode

1202
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And that's the same thing I mean this show is a complete rip off

1203
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Of The Apprentice in many ways

1204
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So yeah I

1205
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Really didn't hate it

1206
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
In fact I kind of liked it

1207
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And I think I'll watch next season

1208
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Isn't that weird

1209
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Like we're supposed to hate this show right

1210
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm not smelling any gas from Shermy

1211
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And to me the second season

1212
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
What the second season did better than the first season

1213
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Is I really felt like the people

1214
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
That were just like

1215
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Didn't even want to be there or were just cast

1216
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Were like the very first person

1217
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
That was off that show

1218
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I was like if this person laughs in the show

1219
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm gonna just swallow my own tongue

1220
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Or something it's just terrible

1221
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But the very first person they kicked off was the right person

1222
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It was somebody who didn't even need to be there

1223
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
They did have someone that was on

1224
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
That was kind of more of a drama causer than anything else

1225
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And not to really like spoil

1226
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
What happens or anything

1227
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But ultimately like when his

1228
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Desserts comes up you kind of go

1229
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Oh yeah like if you're like ah

1230
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So I don't know if that was like a TV thing or what

1231
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But there you go

1232
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So looking at our chat

1233
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Room chat at chat.orangelaunge

1234
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Radio.com Bochi Kawa in our chat room

1235
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Says oh tester I thought that it was interesting

1236
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
This run that jerk must have been a plant

1237
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I really don't think anyone would go that far

1238
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
To be an asshole and would get anywhere near

1239
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Thinking he wants a job I think you're

1240
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Right I think he was one of those people that was cast

1241
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
For drama I mean maybe he did want the job

1242
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
But not as bad as

1243
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
The people that ultimately make it to the

1244
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Final episode and that do end up

1245
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Ultimately getting the job so

1246
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah there you go

1247
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Not as terrible as I would have thought I know I was

1248
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Surprised maybe you would be too who knows

1249
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So that's it that's it for my gaming week

1250
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000

Will start us off

1263
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Ah yes and this is kind of interesting

1264
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You know the Playstation

1265
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
3 hacking news

1266
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It's kind of been going back and forth as far

1267
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Okay we found a crack and oh hey

1268
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
We patched a crack and

1269
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So on and so forth but this

1270
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I don't know if they can be able to recover from

1271
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
During the

1272
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Kind of hacker conference

1273
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Going on right now the chaos communications

1274
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Conference 27C3

1275
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Apparently the

1276
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Hackers responsible for the Wii's homebrew channel

1277
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Who I guess is the group called

1278
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Failoverflow gave a presentation

1279
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Which they've said they

1280
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Figured out the private key

1281
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Sony uses to authorize code

1282
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
To run on retail PS3 systems

1283
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
What that means is that

1284
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Hackers would have almost full control

1285
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Of the PS3 system without

1286
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The use of a USB device

1287
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Basically

1288
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It means they'd be able to sign their own code

1289
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
And you'd be able to

1290
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Do a lot

1291
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Of things on there including you know

1292
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Their whole big thing is to run

1293
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Linux on PS3's whatever the

1294
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Firmware version is

1295
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Of course they're not really interested in

1296
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Piracy with this obviously people

1297
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Could adapt it to do that

1298
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But they're really kind of concerned

1299
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
With just the applications of it and

1300
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Um

1301
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Some of the things that was kind of neat

1302
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
About it is that they

1303
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Literally have almost access to all

1304
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
The like cores and everything using this

1305
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Um

1306
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It's just kind of neat

1307
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Who saw this punchline coming a mile away

1308
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
When the PlayStation 3 first did away with Linux

1309
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And see this is actually hard coded into

1310
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Each console

1311
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
There's no way to patch this

1312
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
They can't

1313
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Wow

1314
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I mean basically what they can do is

1315
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
They create keys or whatever

1316
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
These USB devices have keys on them

1317
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Assigned to them and what they've done

1318
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Like to prevent those

1319
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Jailbreak devices from working

1320
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Is they add blacklists for different keys

1321
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Well

1322
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
The master key you can create your own keys

1323
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
From it so

1324
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
They block one you can just create another one

1325
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
You know it's just impossible to

1326
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Stop it

1327
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So what happens now? Piracy runs rampant

1328
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Or what? Not necessarily I mean

1329
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Their whole big thing is they don't want to

1330
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
They're not aiming towards piracy they just want to

1331
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Bring like homebrew

1332
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
To the PS3

1333
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Linux is really what they're looking to

1334
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Do

1335
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Let's bring Linux back I guess

1336
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
But don't you think this would have also been a conclusion

1337
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Anyway even if Sony hadn't done away with Linux

1338
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Do you think that maybe they were working on this

1339
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Anyway

1340
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I mean I guess

1341
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
What do we know we're not in this little organization

1342
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Or whatever but

1343
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's just interesting to me it's really interesting that

1344
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Sony kind of pulls the plug on the whole

1345
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Linux thing because they were worried about

1346
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
People exploiting it for piracy really

1347
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
At the end of the day and now it's like

1348
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Well we're just going to shove Linux

1349
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
In this thing whether you like it or not

1350
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And if they can install Linux on a freaking toaster

1351
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
They can install Linux on a

1352
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Hacker proof PS3

1353
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
This is probably worse than the whole

1354
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Exploit through

1355
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Linux to begin with

1356
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Because a lot of people may not have had Linux

1357
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
On their system or weren't even interested

1358
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
In that but the fact that they

1359
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Took it away and people don't like

1360
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
When things are taken away especially when they

1361
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Paid for them whether it's an advertised

1362
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Feature or not I don't care

1363
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Now to be fair

1364
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Just devil's advocate you don't have

1365
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
To patch your PS3 to remove

1366
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
The Linux you just won't be able to play

1367
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Any games in the past

1368
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
That's removed from your system

1369
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That's basically it we can either

1370
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Say oh well you know

1371
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You could lose Linux and you get column A

1372
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Games made in 2010

1373
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Or you get column B Linux

1374
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You can't have both

1375
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So that's kind of lame

1376
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
But it's going to be interesting

1377
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
To see where this goes from here because

1378
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That's bad

1379
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
SSJ100Matt in our chat room says

1380
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I don't know I still think people are going to

1381
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Use it to pirate games well of course they are

1382
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Of course there are people out there

1383
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
That are going to do that and

1384
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I don't doubt that they're

1385
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Going to find ways to do that but

1386
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's just that the

1387
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Aim of this group wasn't to

1388
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Just you know

1389
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Create some sort of way to pirate games

1390
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
They're not interested in that

1391
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
But other people are

1392
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Interested in that I'm really curious

1393
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
To see what Sony's kind of

1394
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Response ends up being to this because you know

1395
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
A lot of them are probably coming back from holiday

1396
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Tomorrow you know while I'm sure there's some

1397
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
People working for Sony 365

1398
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Days a year there's probably a lot of people

1399
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Coming back tomorrow and it's going to be interesting to see what

1400
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Their kind of response is if they do try to

1401
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Patch it I know you say it's unpatchable

1402
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
They try to do something I mean

1403
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
They've got it they kind of owe it to their

1404
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Basically I mean they've got a lot

1405
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Of things even just after

1406
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
This conference you know they have things being released

1407
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
That group has already released

1408
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
The development tools for

1409
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
The stuff that they have so now they have

1410
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Different you know

1411
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Like

1412
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Early code and stuff to

1413
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Code to pack and unpack

1414
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Pup and package files to

1415
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Make and read

1416
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Selfs and

1417
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Other developer related stuff

1418
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So you know

1419
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Look forward to possibly

1420
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Custom firmwares what not

1421
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And they've already released the root key so

1422
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I mean

1423
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I don't know there's not much

1424
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
More you can really do there it's just

1425
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah

1426
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It's going to be tough there's

1427
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Not really any way that they're going to be able to get around this

1428
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Wow

1429
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Because if you think about it you can't change

1430
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
The master key if you do

1431
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
That then like

1432
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
You know some of the consoles aren't going to

1433
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Work you just can't it's part of

1434
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
The hardware

1435
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Alright well something else to look forward to

1436
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Hardware wise

1437
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Hardware wise in 2011

1438
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Is the psp2

1439
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Of course we've heard rumors and rumors about

1440
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It but more and more

1441
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Seems to come out every week and this has to do with a

1442
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
New York Times interview that

1443
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Khaz Harai he's the of course Sony computer

1444
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Entertainment head talking

1445
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
A little bit about the psp2 but not

1446
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Directly a lot of people are kind of inferring

1447
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Things about the psp2 because

1448
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Keep in mind Sony has not confirmed a psp2

1449
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It's just one of those duh

1450
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Of course they're working on a new hand held system

1451
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And we don't know if it's a phone

1452
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
We don't know if it's a psp2

1453
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
We don't know if it's both or one of each

1454
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
We don't know that stuff yet but we do know

1455
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
What Khaz Harai said to the New York Times and that was

1456
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Quote depending on the game there are ones

1457
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Which you can play perfectly well with a

1458
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Touch panel but you can definitely play

1459
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Immersive games better without physical buttons

1460
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And pads I think there could be games

1461
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Where you're able to use both in combination

1462
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Oh so suddenly he's kind of

1463
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Endorsing a little bit about touch things right

1464
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Hmm this must mean

1465
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
That some of those rumors about the touch panels are true

1466
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Quote we don't want gamers to be asking

1467
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
What's the difference between

1468
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
A Playstation phone or a phone

1469
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And a psp we have to come up

1470
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
With a message that users will understand

1471
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It would have to be a product that keeps

1472
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
The Playstation's strengths intact

1473
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Again sort of

1474
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
You know kind of

1475
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Not outright saying there's a Playstation

1476
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Phone but saying you know we're trying

1477
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
To kind of you know

1478
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
You have to do it right and of course

1479
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
We're doing it right

1480
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Come on

1481
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Please

1482
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Well Consumer Electronics Show is this weekend if I'm not mistaken

1483
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Or this week

1484
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So you might see it there but

1485
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I mean if it's

1486
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I would say this if the phone

1487
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And the psp2 are

1488
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Separate I would say you'll see the phone

1489
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
As CES you might see it as soon as CES

1490
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Possibly Game Developers Conference

1491
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Psp2 however

1492
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
E3 I mean

1493
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Maybe Game Developers Conference but again

1494
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Game Developers Conference is not supposed to be the media event

1495
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
That's E3

1496
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
But Sony kind of seems

1497
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
To use Game Developers Conference

1498
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Anyway to make big announcements

1499
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
They talked about the move

1500
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
They unveiled Playstation Home

1501
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
It wouldn't be unheard of for them to drop

1502
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
A little bombshell

1503
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Although I think the psp2 would just be so big of a bombshell

1504
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I think Game Developers

1505
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Conference is too early for it

1506
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Unless they just want to come out and say

1507
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Okay fine you figured it out

1508
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So here developers get to work

1509
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
We'll see

1510
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Anyhow moving on with some other news

1511
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Sadness

1512
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Very very much sadness

1513
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
About the psp2 I know

1514
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Arcade Infinity

1515
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Uh oh

1516
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It's gone

1517
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
The inevitable has happened

1518
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's closing on January 15th so we need to go

1519
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Take a trip to LA like now

1520
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Like tomorrow? Yeah

1521
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Good luck right

1522
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Basically Arcade Infinity

1523
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Was the big place that

1524
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Got a lot of RB money in the US

1525
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Not just that

1526
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
But a lot of just import games in general

1527
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I played an Umjamilami

1528
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Arcade machine at Arcade Infinity

1529
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And the tambourine version of

1530
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Samba de Amigo

1531
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Which by the way is the gayest video game I've ever played in my life

1532
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Was that tambourine

1533
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
To whatever

1534
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
You shake around a tambourine like you're Stevie Nicks

1535
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's crazy

1536
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Except without the big hobo

1537
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Stuff

1538
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Anyway I'm sorry I meant boho stuff

1539
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But yeah these are the places

1540
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
That brought us Blaze Blue

1541
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And DJ Max Technica

1542
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And the Gundam game

1543
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Remember that awesome Gundam game?

1544
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And remember one day

1545
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
That we were there

1546
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
We sat and played like what 10 games of

1547
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Shock Troopers

1548
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Just because it was on free play

1549
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
That was pretty fun

1550
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I've never played Typing of the Dead

1551
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And we're like

1552
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Oh my god it's in Japanese

1553
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
We could get as far as the boss

1554
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
That would ask you questions and you'd have to answer them

1555
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And then it would be like shit I don't know Japanese

1556
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I can't do it

1557
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
But I mean man

1558
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I just have so many good memories

1559
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Of that place but now

1560
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
It's gonna be

1561
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Closing

1562
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It's going away

1563
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I gotta be honest the last time I was there

1564
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I didn't have quite the wonder

1565
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
That it had when I was there back in its

1566
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Hay day but I think that's

1567
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Sadly arcades in general

1568
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I really hate to say it but

1569
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Man the online stuff is really

1570
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's really

1571
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Taking its toll I mean it's kind of obvious

1572
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Well you know the other thing that they were doing

1573
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
There was

1574
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Selling import skylines

1575
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Like bringing

1576
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
In cars from Japan

1577
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And trying to make them street legal

1578
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
For sale in the U.S.

1579
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
But yeah apparently Bimani

1580
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Style folks are having a

1581
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Gathering there for the last day

1582
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
So

1583
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Our buddy DJ Tyrant

1584
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Who once in a while does some stories

1585
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Foragelongstreet.com he's gonna go and give us

1586
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
A little report so since I can't be there

1587
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
It'll be nice to have somebody there

1588
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Bring me back a token

1589
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I probably have a bunch still somewhere

1590
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I know I've got some somewhere but

1591
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
That's just really sad cause I mean

1592
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Whenever we would go to LA we would always make it a point

1593
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
That we were gonna go to Arcade Infinity

1594
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And then we'd go have dinner at that place

1595
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
That you had to walk all the way freaking across

1596
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
A you know football field sized parking lot

1597
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
To go eat at

1598
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And then we'd go back and play more games and then

1599
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
You know it's just it's sad

1600
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Yeah Very very sad

1601
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Well it's just sad in general that

1602
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Here's another great arcade closing its doors

1603
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And this is a trend we saw starting

1604
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Years ago with what Southern Hills Golf

1605
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Land Folsom Game Room

1606
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You know all these

1607
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Arcades just started closing and closing

1608
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And even the arcades that are still there

1609
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Which would be like Roseville Golf Land and some of the other

1610
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Golf lands that are out there

1611
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Are nothing but ticket redemption machines now

1612
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
You know what I mean?

1613
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Shermie's trying to get out so she can go poop on the tester

1614
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yep I figured as much

1615
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
She's probably trying to get out No she's fine

1616
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
She's sitting underneath your butt She doesn't poop in the corner

1617
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
She's sitting underneath you

1618
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Shermie is equally sad

1619
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
About the closure of Arcade Infinity

1620
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
It is sad

1621
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Certainly back in the heyday that was the only place

1622
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I could play Keyboard Mania

1623
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Yeah

1624
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
And I just remember playing the crap

1625
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Out of that Gundam game

1626
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Well somebody needs to take a 40

1627
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And pour it out in the parking lot

1628
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
What are they doing to the rest of their candy cabs?

1629
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Unfortunately I only have good beer

1630
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
So I'm not going to do that

1631
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Just go to BevMo and get one crappy beer

1632
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So you can

1633
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Ice cold, cold 45

1634
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Cold 45, dump it in the lot

1635
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Thank you

1636
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Please and take pictures of it

1637
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Take pictures of it

1638
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
One for me and one for my homies

1639
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Rest in peace Arcade Infinity

1640
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Sorry to see you go

1641
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I wonder what they're doing with their cabinets

1642
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
You opportunist

1643
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Probably the same thing that Tilt at the Metron is doing

1644
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
You want to get a BeatMania machine for 300 bucks

1645
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I should check uh

1646
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Well I don't have a

1647
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Speaking of other arcades that have

1648
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Gone away

1649
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You get a Marvel vs Capcom for 300 bucks

1650
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Allen saw that and he said Christmas Rob! Christmas!

1651
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Christmas!

1652
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Poor Allen, poor

1653
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Alright anyway

1654
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Uh yeah

1655
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Well Nintendo was warning that you shouldn't have children

1656
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Under the age of 6

1657
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Playing the 3DS in 3D mode

1658
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Apparently it will make them go cross-eyed

1659
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Well that's not the reason

1660
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
But it may hurt their vision

1661
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
So

1662
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It's bad

1663
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
So don't play it in 3D mode

1664
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Unless you want cross-eyed kids

1665
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Oh come on

1666
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Surely it can't be

1667
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
That you play

1668
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
This for 5 minutes and you're gonna go cross-eyed

1669
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You're talking about prolonged

1670
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Exposure

1671
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Is what this is

1672
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Nintendo's probably over-reacting

1673
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So there isn't a lawsuit

1674
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
When at the end of the day this really comes down to

1675
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Parents, you really should watch how much

1676
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Of the games your 6 year old is playing

1677
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Exactly and that brings up a wonderful point

1678
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Is that you can use the included

1679
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Parental controls

1680
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
That allow parents to lock the device

1681
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
In 2D mode

1682
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So it's the 3DS 2DS

1683
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
That's okay though

1684
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
As much as I think the 3D thing is kinda cool

1685
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Like there's gonna be times where I don't want

1686
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
The 3D, like I just wanna play

1687
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
A 2D little game and have it at that

1688
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
But what's interesting to me

1689
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Is that they are releasing movies

1690
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
On the 3DS

1691
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
At least if E3 is any indication

1692
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I guess we won't really know till the official

1693
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Press reveal or what have you

1694
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
But they were showing a

1695
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Trailer for Tangled

1696
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
The Rapunzel movie that's out in theaters

1697
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
By the way it was actually really good

1698
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
They were showing a trailer

1699
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
For that at E3 on the 3DS

1700
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So they're gonna market

1701
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
3D movies for kids on these things

1702
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
So

1703
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You know

1704
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Granted you could say that well Tangled

1705
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Would also work for a 10-15

1706
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
To an adult really year old

1707
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Come on

1708
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
To an adult year old?

1709
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
You know what parent isn't gonna want to sit

1710
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Their 6 year old in the back of the car and have them watch

1711
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Tangled to shut them up on a road trip

1712
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
In 3D!

1713
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It'd be like buying an

1714
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Expensive 3D

1715
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
HD television and going

1716
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
You know what? I'm watching all

1717
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
3D

1718
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I don't need this 3D

1719
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I'll pay your high premium price

1720
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
For your TV with fancy technology

1721
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
But I'm not, in fact you know what

1722
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I'm not even hooking up HDMI to it

1723
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I'm going straight composite bitch

1724
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So Nintendo

1725
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Is paranoid that

1726
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Some kid somewhere is gonna

1727
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Go cross eyed because they spent

1728
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
12 hours a day looking at the

1729
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
3DS and so they're putting this disclaimer

1730
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
On it to kind of save their own butt because

1731
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Parents can't be bothered to watch how much

1732
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Their kids are playing games. That's what the story

1733
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Should really say, right?

1734
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
At least that's what I think

1735
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Enablers!

1736
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I love this chat room

1737
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Chatter here, big wang eater

1738
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Um

1739
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So that'd be cool if 3DS had a deer hunter

1740
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
In 3D, well you know what?

1741
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Cabela's comes out each year

1742
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
They've been doing a lot of games on the DS

1743
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I would not be surprised if you see a 3DS

1744
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Cabela's game

1745
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Somewhere somehow some idiot parent

1746
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Will let their kid play that, their six year old

1747
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Kid play that in 3D. Big wang eater

1748
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Thank you big wang eater

1749
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Alright, 3D porn

1750
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Well the big wang eater goes on to say

1751
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
3D porn, well you know

1752
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
You will be able to take your own 3D pictures with this

1753
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
You can show the big wang being eaten

1754
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Can you share the pictures you take

1755
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Like on the internet or whatever? I think you can

1756
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Awesome, time to penis

1757
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
5 seconds, 5 seconds

1758
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Before we have a 3D penis

1759
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
You know what?

1760
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
See, some of us actually

1761
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Have people that we can

1762
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Do this in real life with

1763
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And don't need to watch it in 3D

1764
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
We have what's called real life

1765
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Ah

1766
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
They've also already been marketing like

1767
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
When I did see that whole Tangled movie

1768
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Which by the way, I saw lots of

1769
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Six year olds in that theater wearing 3D glasses

1770
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
And watching the movie, but anyway

1771
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
They were showing a commercial

1772
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
For a 3D camera

1773
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So you'd like watch the pictures on your 3D TV

1774
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
That you take with the new camera

1775
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So, and this isn't DS related

1776
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
It's like a new Sony camera or whatever

1777
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
That does 3D pictures

1778
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Cause everybody has a boner for 3D right now

1779
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I like what Isam said

1780
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
4D porn sex across time

1781
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I approve of that

1782
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Alright

1783
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
That's what you need a TARDIS for

1784
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Well, moving on to other things

1785
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Nintendo that aren't necessarily 3D

1786
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But I bet a lot of people wish this was

1787
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword

1788
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Hey remember, there's a new Zelda game coming you guys

1789
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Remember?

1790
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
They were talking about it

1791
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
They were talking about it at E3 and it was delayed from Christmas

1792
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Rob ignored it

1793
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
As if he has the upward thrust

1794
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Only in 2D

1795
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I'm sorry

1796
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
But here's the deal guys, not only has it been delayed past Christmas

1797
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
But now Nintendo is kinda saying

1798
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Yeah that whole early

1799
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
2011 thing

1800
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Liars

1801
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
That's not really gonna happen

1802
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Because of course there is very dense gameplay

1803
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
And you're gonna want to replay this game

1804
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Dense?

1805
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
That's not a description for gameplay

1806
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
They have quietly

1807
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Moved this game to a

1808
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
2011 release

1809
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Could be any time next year

1810
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
We need to save it for

1811
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
The holidays

1812
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
For our Wii HD

1813
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
It's gonna be a game that's slightly uprest

1814
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Well there you go

1815
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
There's not a lot of

1816
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Like huge games I can think of that really have me

1817
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Excited that are coming out on the Wii anytime soon

1818
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Like it's all about the 3DS at Nintendo right now

1819
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
So unfortunately this news is a little bit sad

1820
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Well

1821
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Hey they have innovative games for the Wii

1822
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Like Mario's Sports Mix

1823
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
It's a sports game compilation

1824
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
There's none of those on the Wii right?

1825
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
That sound you heard in the background

1826
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
That was crickets chirping

1827
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
We have a soundboard for that

1828
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
That was me blinking

1829
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Tired call on our chatroom talking about 3D by the way

1830
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
It says 3D TVs are way behind in the 3D technology

1831
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Theaters now are using polarized lenses

1832
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Which doesn't need to use the shutter glasses technology

1833
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
In other words you don't have to recharge the glasses to watch 3D

1834
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Exactly and that's what I'm saying they need to fucking do with those damn TVs

1835
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Cause those glasses are like $5 or free if you steal them from the movie theaters

1836
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
You're not stealing them

1837
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
You're paying the premium for them anyway

1838
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
You're paying the recycler

1839
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
They can go fuck themselves I'm paying for those damn glasses

1840
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Actually

1841
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But they're still gonna charge you the full theater price when you bring in

1842
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Whether or not you bring in your own pair of 3D glasses it seems like

1843
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Actually I thought it was a great suggestion

1844
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
One of my friends suggested after seeing Tron

1845
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You know we should keep these glasses

1846
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And we should like bling them out

1847
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And like you know bedazzle them

1848
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And you'll put like pipe cleaner designs on them

1849
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And all this

1850
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So that way you know next time they try to hand you your 3D glasses

1851
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Oh no thanks I brought my own

1852
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
They have designer polarized glasses you can get like pay like hundreds of dollars for

1853
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Awesome

1854
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Why?

1855
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
You know what I should actually hold onto those to wear over my glasses

1856
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
For when I go outside in the sun

1857
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Nice

1858
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Do those things work

1859
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
The 3D glasses for the theater

1860
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
They don't work with the TVs do they?

1861
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
No

1862
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That was what we were saying

1863
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
The only 3D technology that I think that's worthwhile is the Disney one

1864
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Just because it uses the polarized glasses

1865
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Or Nintendo's new technology which uses nothing at all

1866
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Exactly

1867
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
They're actually looking to do TVs that way too

1868
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Which I think would really hurt your eyes

1869
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
But I think that the polarized glasses are a good alternative

1870
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Because in that way instead of saying

1871
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Yeah you gotta buy this 3D TV

1872
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Oh by the way if you want more than two people to watch that

1873
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
You're gonna need to buy another set of $100 glasses

1874
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Yeah

1875
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
No thank you

1876
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Alright well

1877
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So Zelda Skyward Sword

1878
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
2D, 3D, whatever D it's in

1879
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
It's probably not coming out until December

1880
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
What?

1881
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Upward thrust

1882
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Moving on

1883
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Well you know Final Fantasy 13 came out for the Xbox 360 in Japan

1884
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And guess what?

1885
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
That's how well it did

1886
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,000
It showed up at 39th in the software charts for Japan

1887
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Which is really low

1888
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
So yeah they only sold

1889
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Well I'll put it this way the game that made number 20 sold 22,579 units

1890
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah

1891
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
That's kind of

1892
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So it probably sold about 10,000 or whatever

1893
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Something like that

1894
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Wasn't that how many 360 owners there are in Japan?

1895
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Well the number of

1896
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It's under 1.5 million

1897
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Users in Japan

1898
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And keep in mind the PS3

1899
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Is close to 6 million

1900
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
So

1901
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Basically

1902
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
There were a lot of

1903
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Also because of how early Final Fantasy 13 came out in Japan

1904
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
And they thought it was only gonna be for

1905
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
PlayStation 3 so a lot of people bought

1906
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
A PlayStation 3 just to play Final Fantasy 13

1907
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I was gonna say when I first kind of heard about this story earlier in the week

1908
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I had gotten into Double Take and said

1909
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I thought they specifically said they are not doing 360 Final Fantasy 13 in Japan

1910
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
So where the hell did this come from?

1911
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Well even with this one it had you know

1912
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
A few extra goodies and you know

1913
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
They brought other stuff out and did a price reduction on it

1914
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And it still wasn't enough

1915
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So kind of like the typical international editions they usually do in Final Fantasy games right?

1916
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
But see now though

1917
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Well the whole thing is that typically these international editions have come out on the same console

1918
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And have had the English content

1919
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Like for example I've got

1920
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Final Fantasy X-2 International

1921
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
And the game I can pick

1922
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Japanese or English language

1923
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I can choose my subtitles

1924
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
And yeah I'm trying to

1925
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Watch this comparison to

1926
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
To see you know

1927
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
What the deal is and

1928
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
The Xbox 360

1929
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
One actually kind of looks like

1930
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Poop in comparison

1931
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Oh no it doesn't they look the same

1932
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I think people look way too

1933
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I think in order to see that level of detail

1934
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
You have to be sitting as close to your TV

1935
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
As you're sitting next to your monitor right now

1936
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Well yeah but I'm saying

1937
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
You know but also for people who have

1938
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
You know a really good HDTV

1939
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It's

1940
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Gonna make a difference like right now

1941
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
The biggest things now keep in mind I also

1942
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Have an eye for it

1943
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I'm seeing difference in color quality

1944
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I'm seeing difference in line quality

1945
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
You know

1946
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Yeah but how much of that can be blamed on the fact you're watching a streaming

1947
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And that's why Final Fantasy 13 sucked

1948
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
No Final Fantasy 13 is great

1949
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It is I think it's a great

1950
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Game and it's

1951
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I don't understand all this hatred

1952
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Well I do understand why people are hating on it

1953
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
But trust me I've played way worse games this past year

1954
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Final Fantasy 13 isn't even close

1955
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Well no I'm not saying it's at all bad

1956
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
That would be Final Fantasy 14

1957
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Yeah seriously no I know you're not

1958
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I did the same thing with the Saturn and the Playstation

1959
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Versions of Castlevania Symphony of the Night

1960
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Because we had the Saturn

1961
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
One and the uh

1962
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And we listened to the two

1963
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
We watched both of them

1964
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
The Saturn version had better 2D

1965
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Shitty 3D

1966
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
The Saturn version had better sound quality

1967
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
The Playstation version had better

1968
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Load times

1969
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
So I'm the kind that does

1970
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
This type of comparison so

1971
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Going back to the story at hand because I kind of feel like

1972
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
The 360 PS3 debate on Final Fantasy 13

1973
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Was like 9 months old when the game came out

1974
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
But going back to the story at hand

1975
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I get the sense people in Japan

1976
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Didn't buy this game because A

1977
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
They didn't know for the longest time that it was coming out

1978
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
And most people bought it on Playstation 3

1979
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Thinking it was never coming out on the 360

1980
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And B, you don't have

1981
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Close to that same

1982
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Adoption ratio you have here in the US

1983
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
In Japan you're talking six

1984
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Playstation 3's for every one Xbox 360

1985
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
That's not even

1986
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Close to the ratio here

1987
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Which is not the reverse but it's

1988
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
A lot closer to one to one than that

1989
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And also though I have to look at it

1990
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
This way too is that we're dealing with

1991
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Sony, a Japan based company

1992
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And we're dealing with Microsoft

1993
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
A US based company

1994
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I think they're gonna know their markets a little bit

1995
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Better in their native area

1996
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
That's really my point

1997
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
You know

1998
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
For example, the Saturn did

1999
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
So much better in Japan than it did here

2000
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And a lot of it had to do with marketing

2001
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
A lot of it had to do with audience

2002
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
You know I think that

2003
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Going with the same thing I think that

2004
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Microsoft knew how to market to an American audience

2005
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
They didn't know how to market to a Japanese audience

2006
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And maybe they didn't want the same type of

2007
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Features that we do here so you start off

2008
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
With a less interested

2009
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Base and then you bring out a game

2010
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
However long after

2011
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
There's been another version

2012
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Out that's available to people who

2013
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Have the system

2014
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
So it's

2015
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
It's basically

2016
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I don't know why they expected it to do well

2017
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I was gonna say I was hoping Final Fantasy 13

2018
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Doesn't suck I just bought it but I haven't started it yet

2019
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
It doesn't suck by the way

2020
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
For the Xbox 360

2021
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It doesn't suck it's just better on PS3

2022
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I'll take your word for it then

2023
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And I don't even think it's

2024
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Negligible honestly

2025
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I don't think you would notice a difference

2026
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I was gonna say what's the difference honestly

2027
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
You have to disc swap on the 360 version

2028
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
You know what

2029
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
We had to do that on the PlayStation 2

2030
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
What kind of TV do you have an HD TV

2031
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
That you play on or do you use the standard?

2032
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I have a Samsung

2033
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Is it full 1080

2034
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Or is it only 720

2035
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
You might notice

2036
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Like the hair is a little different

2037
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
It's an LED

2038
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Basically the big things you're gonna notice

2039
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Is difference in color

2040
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
You won't notice any difference if you never see the

2041
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
PS3 version I'll put it that way

2042
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
But the big difference is that you're dealing with

2043
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
More jaggedies

2044
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
More aliasing on the

2045
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Xbox 360 version because the graphics processor

2046
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Is different the game was made for the PS3

2047
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
So you're basically dealing with

2048
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
The whole

2049
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Port issues

2050
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
You're also dealing with the fact that there is

2051
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Rampant hardcore pornography in the Xbox

2052
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
360 version

2053
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
While there wasn't in the PS3 version

2054
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And that may offend some people but for me

2055
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
That was a plus

2056
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I mean

2057
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
It was much

2058
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I'd expect that kind of stuff in Mexico but

2059
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I'm not sure whether that makes me want to play it more or not

2060
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I don't need to know that about you

2061
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Anyhow

2062
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Why don't we travel the world and talk about some release dates

2063
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Some other games that might do a little bit better

2064
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Or

2065
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Not

2066
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
This week is still a little bit light

2067
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
January I mean come on

2068
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
It's not a big ol' release month

2069
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Some cool stuff though coming out

2070
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
But not so much this week

2071
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Lost in Shadow though on the Wii is making

2072
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It's way out so that puzzle game

2073
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
From Hudson Soft it kind of has a little bit of a

2074
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Shadow Colossus vibe to it

2075
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
That'll be on the Wii

2076
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And

2077
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Sherlock Holmes Mystery of the

2078
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Osborne house

2079
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
That's on Nintendo DS

2080
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Cool you get to go to the Osborne's house?

2081
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Uh

2082
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Yeah

2083
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Not that Osborne house I'm afraid

2084
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Uh Emergency

2085
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
2012

2086
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Um

2087
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I'm assuming that you play some sort of

2088
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Emergency crew when the world

2089
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Is ending and yes it looks about right

2090
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Actually so that's kind of cool

2091
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
It says warning the world as we know it is out of

2092
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Control as the head of

2093
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
All rescue operations you

2094
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Must ensure that you get the job

2095
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Done with fire and rescue services

2096
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Yeah I don't think fire and rescue services

2097
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Are going to stop a tidal wave from

2098
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Wiping out a city

2099
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I don't think that really works

2100
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
But they'll try

2101
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
They will try

2102
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Hold back that wave with your axe there

2103
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Um and then apparently Ghost Trick

2104
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Phantom Detective is supposed to be out

2105
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
As well on Nintendo DS

2106
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And that is it

2107
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Traveling over to Japan this week

2108
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Uh not this week

2109
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
But next week is when you start to see some stuff

2110
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
On the 360 like Arcana Heart 3

2111
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
But I guess I'll reiterate that next week

2112
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
On the 360 going over to the Playstation 3

2113
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Kind of the same story

2114
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
There's not really a lot out there either

2115
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I'm getting the sense it's going to be a very

2116
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Slow week

2117
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Nintendo Wii you don't even see anything until the end of the month

2118
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
That's the crazy stuff

2119
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
But the DS

2120
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
The DS probably has your one highlight and big game this week

2121
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Saga 3

2122
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Jiko no Hasa

2123
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Shadow or Light comes out this week

2124
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
That of course is in the Saga series

2125
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Right by Squeenix

2126
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
On the DS and that's probably the big one

2127
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
That people are going to be looking at and importing

2128
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
When I look at the screenshots of this game

2129
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I really kind of go oh it's like a Saga game

2130
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
That kind of looks like those Final Fantasy remakes they did on the DS

2131
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
That's pretty much what you got there

2132
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
So if you like the Saga series you'll probably be into that

2133
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And that is really it

2134
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
That's like seriously the only thing

2135
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
You have to look forward to this week

2136
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Um the PSP does have a slot machine

2137
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Game coming out but do you really care?

2138
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I don't think you do

2139
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
So

2140
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
A slot machine game you said?

2141
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Yes

2142
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
You know that would actually do really well over here to get into

2143
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
With the elderly market

2144
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Can I talk about Europe now?

2145
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I guess you can

2146
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Well um on the first there was

2147
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
UFC trainer like no one really

2148
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Gives a crap about that

2149
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
And on the fourth Lost in Shadow and guess what

2150
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
That's it

2151
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Very slow week but you know the holiday

2152
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Shopping fever is gone so

2153
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Geez people

2154
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
In two weeks we got two great games on the PS3

2155
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Isn't that ironic

2156
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Alright

2157
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Well we got a couple more stories for you guys

2158
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And then the classic game of the week

2159
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
We'll close out part A in just a moment

2160
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Yes one of the bitches that we had last year

2161
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
With Ubisoft with their

2162
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Really odd

2163
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Use of

2164
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
DRM

2165
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
They had a

2166
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Basically you had to be connected

2167
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
To their servers the entire time

2168
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
While you're playing different games

2169
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
And if for whatever reason you

2170
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Feature or had some sort of

2171
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Connection problem whether it be just

2172
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
A quick you know disconnect

2173
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Your game would actually stop

2174
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
And you would have no opportunity to save or whatever

2175
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It would just totally fuck you up

2176
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
And that was on even like single player games

2177
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Like Assassin's Creed 2

2178
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Or Splinter Cell Conviction

2179
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Well apparently though

2180
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
There has been an update I guess

2181
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
That

2182
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Those DRM checks are a little bit

2183
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Easier now

2184
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
In fact on games

2185
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I guess like Assassin's Creed 2

2186
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And Splinter Cell Conviction for example

2187
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
They have now

2188
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Made it where it just has to check

2189
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
With the servers when you boot the game

2190
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
But if you lose your internet connection

2191
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
While playing the game it will not

2192
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Actually interfere with your game at all

2193
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So that's kind of cool

2194
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
But also makes me think that it doesn't matter

2195
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Because people got around the stupid hacks

2196
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
People don't want to deal with it

2197
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
They won't that's the reality

2198
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
They got around it anyways and all it

2199
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Really hurt was the people that bought

2200
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
The game legitimately so

2201
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I don't know

2202
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
But at least it's not

2203
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
As terrible

2204
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Alright

2205
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Well kind of

2206
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
One of the big stories from the end of last year was

2207
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
The fact that Harmonix was being unloaded

2208
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
By Viacom and it looks like we might have

2209
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Some resolution finally to this

2210
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
A press release that came out over the holiday

2211
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
From John Drake saying

2212
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
That who is that Harmonix obviously

2213
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
We are happy to confirm that the news today

2214
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
That the sale of the company is complete

2215
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Viacom and MTV networks have been an

2216
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Amazing home for the past four years

2217
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Blah blah blah fluff fluff right

2218
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
It's where we launched Rock Band and Dance Central

2219
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Beatles, Green Day, blah blah blah

2220
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
We're excited to be returning to our roots as an

2221
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Independent and privately owned studio

2222
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And what this means the

2223
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
DLC schedule marches on for

2224
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Rock Band, we will continue our support of

2225
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Previously released titles, and we're hard at

2226
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Work at some unannounced projects that we think

2227
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
You're going to be pumped about

2228
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
And the other half of this, it wasn't in the press release

2229
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
But it was confirmed they are keeping the licenses

2230
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
For Dance Central and Rock Band, they will get to

2231
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
If they decide to make Rock Band 4

2232
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Or Dance Central 2

2233
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I think at least one of those is a sure thing

2234
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I would honestly say

2235
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I don't think Rock Band 4 is a sure thing at this point

2236
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I think Harmonix might do

2237
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Something new

2238
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
The whole plastic instrument thing

2239
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
But they may not call it Rock Band

2240
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And I think that's okay

2241
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I think sometimes your series needs a swift kick in the pants

2242
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
So I would be

2243
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Quite okay with that if they decide

2244
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I'd be okay with Dance Central 2

2245
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I would be totally okay with Dance Central 2

2246
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And I think that's a sure thing

2247
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Of course there's going to be a Dance Central 2

2248
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Absolutely, it was clearly the biggest game on Connect

2249
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I'm so happy, we took down the tree today

2250
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
The Christmas tree, so that we were able to move the

2251
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Coffee table out from the middle of the room again

2252
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And connect space again

2253
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Congratulations, there you go

2254
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So there it is, Harmonix going independent

2255
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
That's a very

2256
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Kind of an obvious resolution

2257
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That none of us had guessed previously

2258
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
So good luck

2259
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
You kind of think

2260
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
When people are talking about selling a company

2261
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
It's like

2262
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
You never really think, hey they could just buy themselves

2263
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Because they probably have a lot of money

2264
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Right?

2265
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Well, good luck to Harmonix

2266
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Pay off for them, we'll see

2267
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Anyway, let's take a minute not to talk about the future

2268
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Or this year, the coming year

2269
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
But to reflect on the past

2270
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
And gaming's history and how we all got here

2271
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
To 2011 and gaming

2272
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
It's a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week

2273
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
In this segment, DarkSakura

2274
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Is going to go through the archives

2275
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
In her cavernous vault

2276
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
That she has here in the house

2277
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
And find a game that she says, hey

2278
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It's not that big

2279
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Listen kids, you should be playing this game

2280
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Respect your elderly games

2281
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And what game did you pick this week?

2282
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Hard Drivin'

2283
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
As in the nap machine

2284
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I will go into why it's the nap machine later

2285
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So forget all this

2286
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Need for speed stuff

2287
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Listen to those really great sound effects

2288
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Bong bong

2289
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Listen for a minute

2290
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
That's about as much music as the game has

2291
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
As a drum roll

2292
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Serious

2293
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Well then listen to some squeaking breaks

2294
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Listen to DarkSakura, tell us about this game

2295
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Hard Drivin' was basically

2296
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
It was touted

2297
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
According to this poster

2298
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
As the world's first authentic driving simulation

2299
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Game

2300
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It was the first 3D polygon

2301
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Driving environment

2302
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
It used a simulated cabinet

2303
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Virtual reality, oh my god, lawnmower man

2304
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
It's real

2305
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And it was all on custom hardware

2306
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
It had force feedback

2307
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
A car physics simulator

2308
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And most of the

2309
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Design was done by

2310
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Some dude named Max Behensky

2311
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
So that's pretty cool

2312
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Now also keep in mind that

2313
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Other games that came out around this time like

2314
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Pole Position and Outrun were sprite based

2315
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Scaling

2316
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Ah, you found the best part

2317
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
The instant replay, trying to go up that loop

2318
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Basically, instead of

2319
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Having the sort of artificial graphics

2320
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Where the car wouldn't land

2321
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
The right, you know, right side up

2322
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Or, you know

2323
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
It actually used very realistic

2324
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Physics in the game

2325
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
When you went too far off track

2326
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
You would crash your skin

2327
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Your windshield would crack

2328
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
You could keep driving

2329
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And then it also gave you the replay

2330
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Where you would die

2331
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And a hideous car fire

2332
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
But you gotta admit, some of it's a little janky

2333
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Like the car explodes and then suddenly

2334
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
In the next frame it's back together

2335
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
It's very jank

2336
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
We are very spoiled by today's graphics

2337
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Keep in mind, this was 1988

2338
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And this was a polygon game

2339
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
In 1988

2340
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Wow, car explosions

2341
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Do not work that way

2342
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
The car that you're supposed to be in

2343
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Is sort of like a Ferrari Testarossa

2344
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So I mean, that's pretty cool

2345
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You basically

2346
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Race

2347
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Against

2348
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
This car called the Phantom Photon

2349
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And you can race the wrong way

2350
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
You can do all this other stuff

2351
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
It's actually, you know

2352
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
It has, um, also

2353
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
You can play it in automatic

2354
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
You also have a realistic manual

2355
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Transmission with a clutch and everything

2356
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
You can stall the car

2357
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
When you miss shift

2358
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And, you know, like I said, force feedback and everything

2359
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
So it's meant to be a driving simulator

2360
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
And, you know

2361
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
This game was

2362
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Pretty crazy for its time

2363
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
It was put out by Atari

2364
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
And

2365
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
You know, they

2366
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
This was really one of the coolest ones

2367
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
For the record, the

2368
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Genesis version of this game is shit

2369
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Utter, utter shit

2370
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Oh, the Super Nintendo one was shit too

2371
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Yeah, um, so

2372
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
As far as sequels that came out

2373
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
There was Race Driving

2374
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
In 1990, Hard Drivin' 2

2375
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Drive Harder that came out, um

2376
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
On the

2377
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Yeah, on the Atari ST

2378
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And Commodore Amiga

2379
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
An unreleased one called Hard Drivin'

2380
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Airborne in 1993

2381
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And then Street Drivin' that came out in 2001

2382
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
On the GameCube, Playstation 2 and

2383
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Xbox, um, different versions

2384
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Came out, there

2385
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Hard Drivin' 3, now it's hard

2386
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Hard Drivin' 4 in my pants

2387
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Now, um

2388
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
This that I'm gonna quote on here is that

2389
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
The engine, transmission, control, suspension and

2390
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Physics were modeled in conjunction with

2391
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Doug Milliken who was listed

2392
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
As a test driver in the game credits

2393
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
So, um, that's actually

2394
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Pretty cool, um, this says that his father

2395
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
William Milliken of Milliken

2396
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Research led a team at Cornell

2397
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Aeronautical Laboratory

2398
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
In Buffalo, New York that converted

2399
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Aircraft equations of motion

2400
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
To equations of motion for the automobile

2401
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
So it was a

2402
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
You know, they actually used real science

2403
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
In it, which I thought was pretty cool, it was meant to be a real

2404
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Stimulator

2405
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Um, as far as Easter Eggs

2406
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
In the game, one of the buildings along

2407
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
The speed course, um

2408
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Has a sign that says, uh, sorry

2409
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
A sign above the door that says, The Hut

2410
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Um, if

2411
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
If you made a hard left turn at the start

2412
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Of the game, you have a secret track

2413
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Which is a long straight road that leads to

2414
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
A very short circular track

2415
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Around a tower

2416
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
If you slow down and stop in front of one of the buildings

2417
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
A keyhole appears in the building door

2418
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
What?

2419
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Running into a cow will cause a moo sound to be played

2420
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
At least in the Sega Genesis port

2421
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
There's exactly one cow

2422
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Um, and

2423
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Ate carefully

2424
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
After getting a sufficiently high score

2425
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Then, um, you get a full course race against the

2426
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Phantom Photon on the stunt track

2427
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
So it's pretty cool

2428
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Um, but, now I have to tell you

2429
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
About, now I'm gonna

2430
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Put a picture of the cabinet in the chatroom

2431
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Um, for a reason

2432
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
For a specific reason

2433
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
This thing had

2434
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
A chair that would swivel out

2435
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
And

2436
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Inside it was very dark

2437
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
So one day when I was working at

2438
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Cyber station at Bel Air Mall

2439
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
In Mobile, Alabama

2440
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
There was nobody

2441
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
In the damn mall

2442
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
It was Tuesday morning

2443
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I had been up all night, so guess what I did?

2444
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I sat my happy butt

2445
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Inside the chair at hard driving

2446
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I filled myself in, and I took a three hour nap

2447
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Well, you know, not like a

2448
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
A full on nap

2449
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I could still hear people

2450
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
No one came in

2451
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I got all my other stuff done

2452
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And I sat in the hard driving machine

2453
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
And took a three hour nap

2454
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
It was dark, the chair was comfortable

2455
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
How colossally irresponsible of you, but funny

2456
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Oh please

2457
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I was 19

2458
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
So

2459
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
But at any rate

2460
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
That's my story about the hard driving cabinet

2461
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
It's the great nap machine

2462
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
The game actually, I'll be honest

2463
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I don't like playing hard driving

2464
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
It's hard

2465
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And time has not treated it well

2466
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
No it hasn't

2467
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
But it's notable for what it is

2468
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I gotta click on this link

2469
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Cause there's a YouTube suggestion here

2470
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
The worst Genesis game ever made

2471
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Hard driving

2472
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I just wanna remind myself how fucking terrible this is

2473
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Okay, I don't wanna hear some asshole

2474
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Talking about it, I just wanna see it here

2475
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Oh yeah, with the

2476
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
And I say that with love

2477
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Crazy ass draw in on the thing

2478
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Oh my god, the framery on here is so awful

2479
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
It's hideous, it's hideous

2480
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
But I mean

2481
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
God, can you imagine that people

2482
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Somebody somewhere actually dropped like $50 on this game

2483
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I know

2484
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
It's one freaking track, right?

2485
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
You missed the cow, Rob, you missed the cow

2486
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Well I'm gonna burn in hell for all eternity

2487
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
For missing the damn cow

2488
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I like Test Drive 3

2489
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
And it came out around the same time

2490
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Looked very similar to this

2491
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And they, um

2492
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
They came out after this

2493
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
You also have to race other cars

2494
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And I used to try to take a shortcut by driving off-road

2495
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Not something a performance

2496
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
High speed vehicle is meant to do

2497
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
But I did encounter lots of deer

2498
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Deer

2499
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Rob's looking at the Commodore 64

2500
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Yes, Commodore 64 hard driving

2501
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I have to see this

2502
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Wow

2503
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
It's like $10

2504
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
And this framery is awful

2505
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Oh wow

2506
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
You could grow old playing this game

2507
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Imagine

2508
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I know this is terrible radio

2509
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Imagine you're playing, I'll link it in the chat

2510
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
But for those listening on the podcast

2511
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Imagine you're playing hard driving on the Game Boy

2512
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
The old Game Boy

2513
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Like the old Game Boy

2514
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Monochrome

2515
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
There's the link in chat

2516
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Somebody spent $50 on this game

2517
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Just so you know

2518
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Is there a loop even?

2519
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Oh no, here's the bridge

2520
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Crash

2521
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Actually, you might get better

2522
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
You might get a faster framerate on the Game Boy

2523
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
And then that was, wow

2524
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Rama in our chat room says

2525
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I worked in a video store when this game came out

2526
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
It did pretty well in sales

2527
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Because it's virtual reality, man

2528
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
It's crazy, wave of the future

2529
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Or something

2530
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
At any rate

2531
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Like I said

2532
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'm not a fan of the game itself

2533
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
However, I will

2534
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
You're a big fan of naps

2535
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I love naps

2536
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
But I will give it props

2537
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
For what it is and what it did at the time

2538
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
If not for hard driving

2539
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
We may not have Ridge Racer

2540
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
That's true

2541
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
This is

2542
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
The beginning of our 3D racing games

2543
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Right here

2544
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Even though this game really

2545
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Hasn't been treated well with time

2546
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And it's kind of shit now

2547
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Without it, we wouldn't have some of the stuff we have today

2548
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Because people

2549
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Like to do loopy loops and jumpy jumps

2550
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I just figured I took so many damn naps in the machine

2551
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I may as well play it a couple of times

2552
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I'll tell you something else that's funny

2553
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I want to tell it to other people

2554
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Who have worked in an arcade

2555
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
We got an allotment of 25 tokens a week

2556
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Tell me

2557
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Once you started working at the arcade

2558
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Stop using your damn tokens

2559
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Did you not play anything for a while?

2560
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Because you were tired of being there

2561
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
When I quit Rob, seriously

2562
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I had 600 and something tokens

2563
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I played a lot of Skee-Ball

2564
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And a lot of Street Fighter Alpha 2

2565
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
5th Dream in our chat room says

2566
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
VR without glasses

2567
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Without glasses, sound like anything recent?

2568
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I see what you did there

2569
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Alright

2570
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
That may be a very topical

2571
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And appropriate game of the week

2572
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
It might be a lot

2573
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Crazier than you think

2574
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
There it is, a classic game of the week

2575
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Hard driving

2576
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
On various systems

2577
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
But we're going to give it to the arcade

2578
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Because the arcade one can nap in

2579
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
And definitely not the Commodore 64

2580
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Definitely not that one

2581
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Alright, that's going to do it for Part A of Orange

2582
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere, we're not done

2583
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
We've got plenty more show to go

2584
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
We're going to talk about Chrono Trigger

2585
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Super Meat Boy, Valve, Indie Games

2586
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
The 3DS, yes more

2587
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
But we have some actual big news about it

2588
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
So we're going to talk about all that when we come back with more

2589
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio, so don't go anywhere

2590
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2591
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
The show where every gamer has a voice

2592
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
We're taping episode number 395

2593
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Tonight, January the 2nd of

2594
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
2011, it's our first show of 2011

2595
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Rob Roberts here with you

2596
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Over the next few hours, of course DarkSakura, Loki

2597
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And our special guest tonight, Gary here in studio

2598
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Talking about video games and so forth

2599
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
We're going to get into the rapid fire news

2600
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
In just a minute, but first

2601
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Some quick plugs for some other shows that we here

2602
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
At OLR are branching out into

2603
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
By the way, special thanks to the

2604
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Forces that be at our website for putting the little

2605
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Links now right there on OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2606
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
So if you're curious about some of the other shows

2607
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
We do, they are all right there

2608
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
So DarkSakura does a show, it's called

2609
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Comic Insanity

2610
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Talks a lot about comic books

2611
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Yep, and we are dark until

2612
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Next week, so we will be recording

2613
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Again this next weekend

2614
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
All right, the best

2615
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Little Horde House in Azeroth

2616
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
My little show about Warcraft, which by the way

2617
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Had some Comic Insanity crossover this week

2618
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Tiara was our special guest, or Maron Marvel

2619
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
From that show, so it's a good one to listen to

2620
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
It was actually a really good show this week I had to say

2621
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
So check that out at

2622
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Our link in iTunes

2623
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
We don't really have a website yet, working on it

2624
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
So search us in iTunes

2625
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Horde House, H-O-R-D-E space

2626
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
H-O-U-S-E, or we are linked

2627
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Right there at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2628
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
We have a blog spot technically, but that's just what

2629
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
We use to link our feeds, so we don't

2630
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Don't take that too seriously

2631
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Anyhow, that's that

2632
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Let's get into some quick news

2633
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Some rapid news, believe it or not

2634
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
There was still some stuff that happened in the gaming world

2635
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
This week, so

2636
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Believe it or not, few things

2637
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Christmas doesn't stop everything

2638
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
So it was announced

2639
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
This week at Pokemon Black and White

2640
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
We'll be headed over to

2641
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
North America on March 6

2642
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
You'll be able to play with your

2643
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Pokemans on that date

2644
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
And of course the two versions

2645
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Will have slightly different

2646
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Themes to them I guess this time

2647
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
The black version will offer

2648
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Pokemon

2649
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Looks like a Reshirium

2650
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
And a setting called

2651
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Black City, while white will contain

2652
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
A lush green area called

2653
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
White Forest

2654
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And will let you capture a Pokemon

2655
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Named Zekrom

2656
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Boy, they're having to get

2657
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Creative with the alphabet soup on these

2658
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Pokemon names, aren't they?

2659
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
So

2660
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Those are actually going to be

2661
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Coming March 6

2662
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
On the

2663
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Nintendo DS

2664
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Also

2665
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Not really coinciding

2666
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
With that, but next month

2667
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
There's going to be some

2668
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Pokemon downloads available

2669
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
At GameStop and Toys R Us

2670
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
This is actually happening between

2671
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
January 30th and February 5th

2672
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
At Toys R Us

2673
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
You're going to be able to pick up

2674
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Ash's

2675
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Pikachu

2676
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
A version of that character

2677
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
With a special set of abilities at Toys R Us

2678
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
I guess

2679
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
He starts off at

2680
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Level 50

2681
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Cool, I guess

2682
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Some other stuff you can check out

2683
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Of course at GameStop

2684
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
During

2685
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I guess during different weeks

2686
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
They're going to have different Pokemon you can download

2687
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
January 3rd through the 9th

2688
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
They have

2689
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Raikou

2690
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Looks like 17th through 23rd

2691
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
And Tai

2692
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
And

2693
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Looks like

2694
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Entei, I guess

2695
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
31st through February 6th

2696
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Suisin

2697
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
And

2698
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
That means nothing to me, by the way

2699
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Because I don't play Pokemon

2700
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Nor do I understand what any of these

2701
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Really flamboyant

2702
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Slightly mythological creatures

2703
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
That almost looks like a dog

2704
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
But if you want to be

2705
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
The very best

2706
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
No one ever was

2707
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
You gotta catch them all

2708
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
It's like STDs

2709
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
To train them is your cause

2710
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Gotta catch them all

2711
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Uh

2712
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Something that

2713
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I'm not sure a lot of people may be wanting to catch

2714
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Do you think antibiotics could

2715
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Clear up a bad case of the Pokemans?

2716
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I'm on a strong

2717
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Dose of antibiotics right now

2718
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
And I have no

2719
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Urge to play Pokemans

2720
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
So maybe

2721
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Dynasty Warriors 7

2722
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Is coming to North America

2723
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
March 22nd

2724
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
And it will be, I guess, the first version

2725
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
That will include 3D

2726
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
And move support, of course on the Playstation 3

2727
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And I guess

2728
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
The game will also be on Xbox 360

2729
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
As well

2730
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Some new stuff that's gonna be in the game

2731
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Apparently they have a

2732
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Free roam mode dubbed Chronicle mode

2733
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
There's gonna be 60 playable characters

2734
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
And I believe online co-op

2735
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Is the other brand new thing

2736
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
So yay

2737
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And then last but not least

2738
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
As

2739
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
A lot of games seem to

2740
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Kind of go this route

2741
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Devil Summoner Soul Hackers

2742
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Is a game that I guess came out on the Saturn

2743
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Back in Japan in 1997

2744
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
It has not been released

2745
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Over here in North America

2746
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Or has gotten an English release anywhere in the world

2747
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I remember that game

2748
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
So now

2749
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
A group of hackers calling themselves

2750
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Devil Hackers

2751
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
What a friendly name

2752
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
They're working on a fan made

2753
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Translation of the title for

2754
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
The PSP

2755
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And of course

2756
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
They have a teaser trailer

2757
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
For it, but it's like 13 minutes long

2758
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
So that's a big tease

2759
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
That's a long trailer, geez

2760
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
That is a long trailer

2761
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I mean, do we really need to watch a trailer of

2762
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Like, hey look, the game's in English now

2763
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I mean, this, I don't know

2764
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
You know what, I hadn't heard about this game

2765
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Until tonight, so maybe some people just need to

2766
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Know about its epic epicness

2767
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Maybe

2768
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Hey, speaking of epic, Rock Band

2769
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Is a very epic music game

2770
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And there's an epic musician coming to the game

2771
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
This week, and it doesn't get any better

2772
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Than Johnny Cash, ladies and gentlemen

2773
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Coming this week to Rock Band

2774
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
And it's a big pack of

2775
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
8 songs that you can get for

2776
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
About, what is that

2777
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
1080 Microsoft points

2778
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It's about 14 bucks and all said and done

2779
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Cry Cry Cry

2780
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Don't Take Your Guns to Town

2781
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Five Feet High and Rising

2782
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Folsom Prison Blues

2783
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I Got Stripes

2784
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I Walk the Line

2785
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Tennessee Flat Top Box

2786
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
And the Ballad of Ira Hayes

2787
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Awesome

2788
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Also, if that wasn't good enough, Dark Soccer

2789
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Free songs coming out this week

2790
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Free shit

2791
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
It is 9 songs for free

2792
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
It's the Rock Band pack

2793
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
It's just merry freaking January

2794
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
There it is, 9 songs for free

2795
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
They are all, of course, indie bands that

2796
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Kind of have ties to harmonics like Bang Camaro

2797
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
And you know, things like that

2798
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
But hey, you know what, free is free

2799
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
You might find some music you like

2800
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
So there you go

2801
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
By the way, also, some pro guitar and bass

2802
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Stuff on some of those Johnny Cash songs

2803
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Rob!

2804
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
But only like I Walk the Line and Tennessee Flat

2805
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Our friend has brought over the guitar

2806
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
The pro guitar

2807
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Well, I didn't get to see it used

2808
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
But it was really nice

2809
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
So many buttons on it

2810
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Better be nice for the price that it is

2811
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Right?

2812
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
He seemed to like it

2813
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I watched him playing stuff with it

2814
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
It was pretty cool

2815
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I mean, not last night, but New Years

2816
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
If you

2817
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Like Rock Band 3

2818
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
And you like Fallout 3

2819
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Then this song is for you

2820
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
And it's on the Rock Band Network

2821
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
You're going to have to dig for this one a little bit

2822
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
It's Kirby Crackle

2823
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Doing the Fallout tribute song

2824
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Vault 101

2825
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And that's a little play on

2826
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Where you start in the game

2827
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Fallout 3

2828
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
That's available on the Rock Band Network store

2829
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
So if you like that song

2830
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
There's a clip of it available on YouTube

2831
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Rock Band isn't the only game

2832
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Getting some download stuff coming

2833
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Dance Central is still kicking

2834
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
It is still going

2835
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
In fact, actually it came out a couple weeks ago

2836
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
But we were off for the holidays

2837
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Let's see

2838
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Rihanna came out with Disturbia

2839
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Girls and Boys

2840
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
By Blur

2841
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
That's kind of cool

2842
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
And Janet Jackson with Control

2843
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Awesome

2844
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Would you dance to Girls and Boys in Dance Central?

2845
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I know you like your Blur

2846
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Super Meat Boy

2847
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
If you were waiting for this game on the Nintendo Wii

2848
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
You are going to be waiting forever

2849
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
That is because the Wii version of Super Meat Boy

2850
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Is gone

2851
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
What it boils down to

2852
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You can read a very interesting

2853
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Press release or statement from the folks behind

2854
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Super Meat Boy

2855
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
But basically, the 40 megabyte limit

2856
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Imposed on WiiWare games by Nintendo

2857
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Means the Super Meat Boy version would have been

2858
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Shit

2859
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
There would have been tons of songs

2860
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
The Dark World levels wouldn't have even been there

2861
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Basically, you would have gotten a

2862
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
And they called it this, a shitty version of Super Meat Boy

2863
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
So it would fit right in with everything else

2864
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Really

2865
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
But what's kind of sad about this is that

2866
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Originally, this was announced as a WiiWare game

2867
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
And so they've had to do a little bit of backtracking

2868
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Saying, hey, we know Wii originally announced this

2869
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
As a WiiWare thing

2870
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
But guess what?

2871
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I think it was that Nintendo was really the first

2872
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
To announce it

2873
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Specifically for the Wii to begin with

2874
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
They were just making a game and Nintendo kind of wanted it

2875
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
And B

2876
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
You know what? The game grew bigger

2877
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
And it's a great game

2878
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
And if you own a Wii

2879
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
You probably have a PC somewhere in your house

2880
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Even if you don't have a 360

2881
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
At least you can get this game somewhere

2882
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
The game will not be coming out on the PlayStation 3

2883
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Due to an arrangement

2884
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
With Microsoft

2885
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
You can kind of read between the lines there

2886
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Dark Sakura

2887
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Well, Squeenix has decided

2888
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
That they are going to

2889
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Have another Final Fantasy game

2890
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Duh!

2891
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
They actually filed for a European trademark

2892
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
For Final Fantasy Type 0

2893
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
And has it under everything

2894
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
From computer game software to toy swords

2895
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
So

2896
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Maybe it'll be cool

2897
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Then we have new characters

2898
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
For Tekken Tag Tournament 2

2899
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
There's a Lutadora

2900
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
And

2901
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
They don't know her name

2902
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
But she's pink!

2903
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
She's wearing a rasslin' mask

2904
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
She makes me think of Rainbow Mika

2905
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
And it's a she

2906
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
So maybe they're taking a page from Capcom's book

2907
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
And then

2908
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
In other news

2909
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
There's actually a few more things

2910
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
That are sort of cementing in

2911
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
That the

2912
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Previously rumored taskmaster

2913
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Akuma and Sienkou

2914
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Are going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom 3

2915
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And that's in the way of

2916
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Xbox 360 achievements

2917
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
There is one called

2918
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
For those who dwell in darkness

2919
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
And so that's going to be a team

2920
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Composed of all Darkstalkers characters

2921
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
So that means three characters

2922
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
So there's going to be another Darkstalker

2923
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
So far we just have Felicia

2924
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
And Morrigan

2925
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
So all the rumors are going to Sienkou

2926
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
And then there's one called Fate of the Satsui no Haro

2927
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Which is

2928
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Which is going to be

2929
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Basically the only other person

2930
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
That Ryu could fight would be

2931
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Akuma

2932
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Because that's the only person in game canon

2933
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Would have that going on

2934
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Unless you count Marvel superheroes

2935
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
What about the guy that's from

2936
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Super Street Fighter 4

2937
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
The one that was

2938
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
What was it

2939
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Not Shenlong

2940
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Or whatever

2941
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Oh, Gokun

2942
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Like, it was another character

2943
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
It wasn't Akuma

2944
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Or whatever, it was supposed to be there

2945
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Yeah, Gokun

2946
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
There's Sensei, that's Gokun

2947
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
And he doesn't follow that

2948
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Oh

2949
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Because he's hardcore badass and has cool music

2950
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
And then the other one

2951
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Of course the rumor was Taskmaster

2952
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Who, I'm like, dude, he's not even relevant

2953
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Why put him in it, but

2954
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I guess, but there's

2955
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
There's supposed to be

2956
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
More going on with that one

2957
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
They also said there's

2958
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Another list of achievements

2959
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Among others are who will answer the call

2960
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
And this achievement is

2961
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Participate in 8 player lobby

2962
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
On Xbox Live, so

2963
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
There's going to be lobbies

2964
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
So we also

2965
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Get the Sentinel and

2966
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Hagar are also rumored to be

2967
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
In it, I'm just happy

2968
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
That X-23 is in it, so

2969
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
That's it

2970
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Sounds like a definite purchase for you

2971
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Than Dark Sakura

2972
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Hell yeah

2973
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
It doesn't even matter what character

2974
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Deadpool

2975
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I am sick of Deadpool in the comics

2976
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
But I love everything else that has Deadpool in it

2977
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Does that make sense?

2978
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
No, but that's okay

2979
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Twitter.com slash OLR

2980
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Every week we ask you to show us your tweets

2981
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And we will respond to them here on

2982
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
The program

2983
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
We're going to start tonight with a tweet

2984
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Nathan Jackson on Twitter

2985
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Question for OLR

2986
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Is the Kinect going to fundamentally change

2987
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Gaming to the point of abandoning

2988
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Controllers completely?

2989
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I'm going to give that a big fat

2990
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
No, because some people

2991
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Like to touch things

2992
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
They like that, and funny enough

2993
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I think that's all kind of part of Sony's

2994
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Marketing campaign is that

2995
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Sometimes people want tangible things

2996
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
But

2997
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Here's case in point

2998
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
There's only so much of the iPhone

2999
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Gaming I can take because I don't have those

3000
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Tangible buttons and the responsiveness

3001
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Isn't always there for me

3002
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I think they seriously need to

3003
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Aren't they supposed to be unveiling

3004
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
New stuff soon or something?

3005
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I think MacWorld is coming up this week

3006
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
This month

3007
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
They seriously need some sort of controller thing

3008
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Or something

3009
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
It would really help

3010
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Will it change gaming?

3011
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Sure, this type of technology

3012
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Has been slowly coming at us ever since

3013
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
The Wii, I mean what you're seeing with

3014
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
The Kinect is really just an evolution of something

3015
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
We've kind of seen before

3016
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
And it will evolve again

3017
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
So is the Kinect

3018
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Here to stay in gaming culture?

3019
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Sure, but is it going to

3020
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Eliminate what you know of games today?

3021
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Nah, not until we have

3022
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
The holodeck, once the holodeck's here

3023
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Then it's all over, because remember

3024
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
And I've said this on the show a lot

3025
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Everything we do

3026
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
And with every generation

3027
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Is bringing us one step closer to the holodeck

3028
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
For reals

3029
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Once gaming reaches the holodeck

3030
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
We're on the last generation of gaming

3031
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Even then there might be a holodeck 2.0

3032
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Huh, I don't know

3033
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Alright, let's see, moving on with some other tweets

3034
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I'm going to

3035
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
DJ Rama S sends us a tweet

3036
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Interesting

3037
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
EA is being sued

3038
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
By gamers

3039
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Because of the football license

3040
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Exclusivity

3041
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
That they have

3042
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
That's the story that he's linking us to

3043
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I thought I heard about this before

3044
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Maybe something has progressed with this

3045
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
I could have sworn I heard something about this before

3046
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
But it was like years ago

3047
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
But anyway, whatever

3048
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Let's see

3049
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
They're saying

3050
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
We believe EA forced consumers to pay an artificial premium

3051
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
On Madden NFL video games

3052
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
We intend to prove that EA could inflate prices

3053
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
On their sports titles

3054
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Because these exclusive licenses

3055
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Restrain trade and competition

3056
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
For interactive sports software

3057
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Because, you know, when NFL 2K5 came out

3058
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
It was only 20 bucks

3059
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And EA had to sell Madden 2005

3060
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
At 30 bucks

3061
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
And then once the exclusive deal hit

3062
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Well shit, those games just cost like 60 bucks

3063
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Since then

3064
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
They want anybody who's purchased

3065
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
An EA football game since August 2005

3066
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
To get damages in this settlement

3067
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Which if it ends up being this whole class action thing

3068
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Means every person will probably get 50 cents

3069
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Hope you retained all your proof of purchases

3070
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
For these 5 year old games

3071
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Good luck

3072
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
By the way, yeah, I knew this was old

3073
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
It was originally filed in mid 2008

3074
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
But, what's new about it

3075
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
A judge has recently allowed

3076
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
This lawsuit to proceed

3077
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I thought I'd heard about this before

3078
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
It was just that long ago

3079
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
But it's moving forward, it wasn't laughed out of court

3080
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
So that could be interesting

3081
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
A story for us

3082
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
From TigerClaw305

3083
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
About the

3084
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Galaga World Record attempt

3085
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Let's see

3086
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Andrew Laidlaw

3087
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Of Washington State

3088
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Has claimed the Galaga

3089
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Record, and he did it on

3090
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
New Year's Day

3091
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
4,525,150 points

3092
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
As certified by

3093
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Twin Galaxies, because you know

3094
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
They carry the spirit stick

3095
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
They say it goes, so they are the authority

3096
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
On video game high scores

3097
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
That was a record taken from

3098
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Phil Day, who set a

3099
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
3.2 million record in November

3100
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Of 2009

3101
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
He said, quote, the first time was magical

3102
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
In a way, this time it's a huge

3103
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Relief. Well, congratulations

3104
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
A lot could be said about

3105
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Sex, that way

3106
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I was gonna say, you know

3107
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Ability to perform

3108
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Under stress

3109
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Oh, you crazy kids

3110
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
That's gonna do it for the tweeters tonight

3111
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
TigerClaw linked us another story, but it's coming up a little later in the show

3112
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Also Spaznator is

3113
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Not enjoying the changes

3114
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
To the feed, because he's not able to tune in

3115
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Remember guys, allgames.com

3116
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Is really the best place for you to tune in

3117
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
It is HTML5 compliant

3118
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I think the only people that are getting screwed are the PSP people

3119
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Because I'm not sure the PSP browser

3120
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Supports the HTML5

3121
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Hopefully there will be a solution for you guys

3122
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Soon, but yeah

3123
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
A lot of change-a-roonies going around at all games

3124
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Radio, from what I understand

3125
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Not bad stuff, just, you know

3126
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
New year, new stuff

3127
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Out with the old, in with the new

3128
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
So some of the shows that are no longer around

3129
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
They're gonna be replaced with some new live shows

3130
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
So, you know, it'll be nice to have some new stuff going on

3131
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
So with that comes streaming changes, et cetera, et cetera

3132
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
So hopefully they get all that worked out

3133
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
In the next couple weeks, and then we can update

3134
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
All our fun little PSP stuffs

3135
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And get everybody back on board

3136
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news

3137
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Mailbag is coming up in a little bit

3138
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Mailbag at orangeontrader.com and Fuse of the Week

3139
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
And of course the Skype line

3140
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
But first, some more news

3141
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Oh yeah, good stuff

3142
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
So this is kinda neat

3143
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
You know, Valve is pretty

3144
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Kind of on the cutting edge with different things

3145
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
They definitely put out a lot of popular games

3146
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
And of course

3147
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
One of the things that they actually have interest in doing

3148
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Is providing

3149
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Better experiences for those

3150
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Who may be disabled

3151
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
For example

3152
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
One of the things that they're looking on to do

3153
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Is with eye tracking

3154
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
This would provide

3155
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Ways for people that, you know, for example

3156
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Don't have full body movement

3157
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
To be able to play

3158
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Without having to

3159
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Use their hands

3160
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Or their entire body

3161
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
As an input device

3162
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
And it says

3163
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
It may be possible in the future

3164
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Let the eyes act as the proxy

3165
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
For the mouse cursor letting gamers

3166
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Transmit navigation

3167
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
And targeting inputs via eye movements

3168
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
If you couple this

3169
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
With the use of blinks

3170
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
And other proxies for button

3171
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Predices, you may remove

3172
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
The need for a mouse and keyboard

3173
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Or gamepad altogether

3174
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
So that's pretty cool

3175
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
So, break this down for me

3176
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
How exactly is that gonna work?

3177
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
They're gonna have some sort of way

3178
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
To track where your eyes are looking

3179
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
And basically

3180
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
They're gonna have some sort of system in place

3181
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Where, for example, say

3182
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
If I blink my eyes

3183
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
A certain way or something

3184
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Like a double blink or something like that

3185
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
That it will act as a key press

3186
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Or maybe if I tilt my head a little bit

3187
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
It's meant for gamers

3188
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
That have very

3189
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Limited movement

3190
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Who's that genius guy in the wheelchair?

3191
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Stephen Hawking

3192
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Stephen Hawking games

3193
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Wasn't it

3194
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I wanna say it's Atari

3195
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
But I'm not 100% certain

3196
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
It had this thing called a psychic controller

3197
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
All it did was control

3198
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
The mind thingy

3199
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I can't remember the name of it

3200
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
But it really just used

3201
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
The movement of the forehead

3202
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And blinking of the eyes to do the control

3203
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
It's the same concept

3204
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
But now that the technology has caught up

3205
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
That it could actually be

3206
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
To track your retinas

3207
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
An ultra-fine Kinect

3208
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Oh certainly

3209
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I think the technology has come up

3210
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Well enough to make it something viable now

3211
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I'd hate to have that

3212
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
With somebody with epilepsy

3213
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
That wouldn't work

3214
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
But it's a neat concept

3215
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Especially though

3216
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
With

3217
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I was thinking

3218
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
There's other uses for head tracking out there

3219
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
But that's really, I think, innovative

3220
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I'm all about

3221
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Making games more accessible

3222
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I don't know if this stuff could ever replace

3223
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
But if it helps enable

3224
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
And bring more people to the table, then hooray

3225
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Then maybe people won't sue

3226
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Well, you know

3227
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
People will sue about what they can sue

3228
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Alright

3229
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Anyhow, Rama says in our chatroom

3230
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
At chat.orangelandreary.com

3231
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I'm reminded of those special custom controllers

3232
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Nintendo put out for disabled people to play their games

3233
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Hmm

3234
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
I don't even remember seeing those

3235
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
But of course

3236
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I never bought one

3237
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
But I think I remember seeing it on a TV show

3238
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Or something

3239
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Anyway, moving on

3240
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
This is something very exciting

3241
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
What is old is new again

3242
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Chrono Trigger

3243
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Yeah, that's right, the old school

3244
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Super Nintendo game

3245
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Is apparently coming back all over again

3246
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Sit down, it's not a sequel

3247
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
But it's the inevitable

3248
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Mobile version of the game

3249
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
There's a teaser site up now

3250
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
On Squeenix's Japanese

3251
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Website

3252
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
That apparently a mobile phone version of Chrono Trigger

3253
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Is on the way

3254
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Spring 2011 is the release

3255
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Very interesting

3256
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Now here's the thing to consider

3257
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
If it's coming out of mobile phones in Japan

3258
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Especially the way this thing looks

3259
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
With the whole PSP style upgrade graphics

3260
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
I'm really reading really far into this

3261
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
But the font they use on

3262
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
The 2011 Spring

3263
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Looks like some of the fonts I see in the Final Fantasy remakes

3264
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Yeah, I'm jumping way ahead with this guys

3265
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
But the point is

3266
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
It probably will inevitably come out for the iPhone

3267
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
That was wordy

3268
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Wasn't it? Probably will inevitably, whatever

3269
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
It's probably going to come out for the iPhone

3270
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
At some point, I just don't want to guarantee it

3271
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Because I don't know anything

3272
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
But hey, Secret of Mana just came out on the iPhone

3273
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Did you know that on the iPad?

3274
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I didn't like the way it controls, but that's just me

3275
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Of course, because the controls on the iPhone suck

3276
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Like, trying to emulate that whole control pad

3277
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Just doesn't work

3278
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
I have yet to see a game that it works in

3279
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
The best iPhone games are the ones that

3280
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Evolve either just tapping

3281
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
And not like having to emulate a control

3282
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Or tilting, like everything else

3283
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Kind of blows

3284
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I will disagree

3285
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
There are two games that it works on

3286
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
And they're both cave games

3287
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
One is for

3288
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Espaluda

3289
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Espaluda 2

3290
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Having the drag

3291
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Across there actually works very well

3292
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
And the little controller thing from Ushihime Sama

3293
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Super Bug Panic

3294
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Actually works really well too

3295
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Amiga777 in our chatroom says

3296
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Hope they don't abandon like they did for Agito

3297
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Oh, that's right, the Final Fantasy 13

3298
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Remember that? Well, keep in mind Amigo

3299
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
We haven't heard anything about Versus either

3300
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
So it could still be happening

3301
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Later this year

3302
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I have a feeling Final Fantasy 13 Versus

3303
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Is going to be the big thing we hear about at E3 this year

3304
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
From Squeenix

3305
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
At least in the JRPG camp

3306
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Because certainly they have the Tomb Raider reboot now

3307
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Isn't that weird that the Tomb Raider reboot is a Squeenix game now?

3308
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Kind of talk about this

3309
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
All the different camps there

3310
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
SalaciousPop in our chatroom says

3311
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
They'll charge $9 for the ROM

3312
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Just like Secret of Mana for iOS

3313
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
$9 for an iOS ROM hack

3314
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Well, hold on

3315
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
You could kind of read into that

3316
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
A couple ways

3317
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Because I don't think it's really a ROM hack

3318
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Because they do have to adapt it

3319
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
For a different screen resolution

3320
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
And they are putting those controls in it

3321
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
$9 is still a lot though

3322
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I mean, I hear you there

3323
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
But those games will inevitably come down in price

3324
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
It'll be $9 this month

3325
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
$7 next month

3326
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
$0.99 when there's a big sale

3327
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
And that's when I will finally get it

3328
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
At some point

3329
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
And I urge you to do the same thing

3330
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Savalas in our chatroom says

3331
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Angry Birds is amazing on iPhone

3332
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
iPad, iTouch

3333
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
You know I still haven't played that game

3334
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
I've heard very mixed things on Angry Birds

3335
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Angry Birds is

3336
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Frustrating and fun

3337
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
I've had it downloaded forever

3338
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
And I still have not played it

3339
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
And then they taunt you with their little snort noises

3340
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Stupid green pigs

3341
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I've played some iPhone games

3342
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I've played that Smurf village game

3343
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Finally

3344
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And I played that dungeon crawler game

3345
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
That Loki gifted me a couple weeks ago

3346
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
It was really pretty

3347
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
But it was kind of hard to control

3348
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Well I mean

3349
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
It's still really pretty

3350
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
It's probably better on the iPad

3351
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I don't know, for some reason

3352
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
You're so cramped on the phone

3353
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
I would think on the iPad you might have a little bit better

3354
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Oh I forgot to mention

3355
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
They have Raptor Call of the Shadows

3356
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
On iOS now

3357
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Oh really? Remember that old shareware game?

3358
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Oh wow

3359
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
How much do they want for that?

3360
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
I wouldn't know

3361
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Alright

3362
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Let's move on, Dark Sakura

3363
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Meat

3364
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Meaty meat meat

3365
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Meat

3366
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Actually

3367
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Super Meat Boy is going to have some goodies coming out

3368
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
More beefy goodness

3369
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Meat

3370
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
With the

3371
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Next update

3372
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
It's supposed to be a free PC update

3373
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
There is

3374
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
There is going to be

3375
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
A level editor

3376
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
An online level portal called Super Meat World

3377
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
And something called

3378
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Enter the Unknown

3379
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
But with the editor you can basically

3380
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Go

3381
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Recreate anything in the game

3382
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Except the bosses

3383
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
You can actually determine

3384
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Which characters will play the level

3385
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
You have all kinds of different stuff going on

3386
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
But you have to hit all the validation

3387
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
To make sure that you can upload it

3388
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
The online level portal

3389
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Basically

3390
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Is just lets you go check out all the levels

3391
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
That people have made

3392
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Super Meat World

3393
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Is a big hub

3394
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
And is

3395
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
What's going to bring you new chapters

3396
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
To the game

3397
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
And it unlocks with

3398
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
30 bandages

3399
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
And pops up on the map before the first

3400
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Chapter actually begins

3401
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
And then Enter the Unknown which is exclusive

3402
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
For the PC

3403
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Picks a random user made level

3404
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
And filters it based on whatever difficulty

3405
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
That you picked

3406
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
So

3407
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Basically it just is giving you a random

3408
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Player created level

3409
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Based on the difficulty that you've selected

3410
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
So pretty cool

3411
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
That's pretty cool

3412
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
That's interesting that whole random

3413
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
S ability

3414
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
It's Mystery Meat

3415
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
That's what they should have called it was Mystery Meat

3416
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I like that

3417
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Trademark that today

3418
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
That sounds so wrong

3419
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Super Meat Boy

3420
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Worst title ever

3421
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
And worst, yeah I've said this a million times on the show

3422
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Worst little logo ever

3423
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
But awesome game

3424
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Bandage Girl

3425
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
You've got to be kidding me

3426
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I know we never did an appropriate top games

3427
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Of the year

3428
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
But Super Meat Boy

3429
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Definitely would have been near my top of the list

3430
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I'm showing

3431
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I'm showing Gary the beginning of the game

3432
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
This is

3433
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
This is real? Wow

3434
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Loki dare I ask if you had

3435
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
To pick one game for your game of the year

3436
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Last year

3437
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Is it possible? Red Dead?

3438
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
That's what everybody else picked

3439
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Red Dead was alright

3440
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
I don't know

3441
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I still play Grand Theft Auto though

3442
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
But Red Dead was kind of cool

3443
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
I don't know if I would say it's my game of the year

3444
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Though

3445
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Maybe

3446
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
I can't pick one

3447
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
That's why we didn't even try to do that

3448
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
There was a lot of great games last year

3449
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
So we just took last week off

3450
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Think about it

3451
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I know a top contender for game of the year

3452
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
This year is going to be

3453
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Well what do you think?

3454
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Earth Defense Force

3455
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Insect Overgeddon

3456
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
But see last year

3457
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I'm pretty sure I would have said on the end of the year

3458
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Classy 14 is going to be the best game of the year

3459
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Next year

3460
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Boy was I wrong

3461
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I'm still going to say Star Trek Online

3462
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Was my game of the year

3463
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Unfortunately it was the game that only lasted

3464
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Me a year

3465
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Mine was probably

3466
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Civ 5

3467
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
He would say that

3468
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Of course I would

3469
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Anyhow

3470
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Let's move on with some more news

3471
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
We've got the mailbag coming up in just a minute

3472
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
We've talked a little bit about the Xbox Live

3473
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Indie Games Winter Uprising

3474
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
It's a group of developers

3475
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
That are putting out games on the Indie Games Store

3476
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
That are kind of getting pissed

3477
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
That there's a lot of crappy games out there

3478
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
And a lot of clones

3479
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
And ripoffs of other things

3480
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Although

3481
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
If we're going to really get into

3482
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Nitpicking on the stuff

3483
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Their games aren't exactly original either

3484
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
But whatever

3485
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
What's cool though is Microsoft has actually

3486
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Put up a banner

3487
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Or I should say a little

3488
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Highlight spot

3489
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
That you can actually check those out

3490
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
From the

3491
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Xbox Live Marketplace

3492
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
They actually added to their spotlight

3493
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
And

3494
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I believe now all the games have been released

3495
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
That are a part of that

3496
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
One of the few last ones here

3497
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Cthulhu Saves the World

3498
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Apparently came out

3499
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Earlier last week

3500
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
And then also they had

3501
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Breath of Death 7

3502
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Which was the last one

3503
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Cthulhu Saves the World looks like it was made with RPG Maker

3504
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
But yeah

3505
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
You can check those out

3506
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
And check out the

3507
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Little link on Indie Games Winter Uprising

3508
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Plus there's plenty of games out there

3509
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
That really need to be checked out

3510
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
And a lot of them

3511
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Actually all of them have free demos

3512
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
And they're cheap

3513
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
A lot of them are really cheap out there

3514
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
So check out the demos

3515
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Buy the full game

3516
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
What are the huge Indie Games

3517
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
That I should be playing? Do we know of any?

3518
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Cause I tried a couple and

3519
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I gotta admit, nothing that really

3520
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Nothing that really made me want to come on the show and talk about it

3521
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Haven't you played Carnivale?

3522
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
I haven't

3523
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I was looking at that Breath of Death

3524
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Whatever though, I was gonna download that

3525
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I just didn't get around to it

3526
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
I think that's what it was called

3527
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
It was one of the first Indie Games I picked up

3528
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
And it's awesome

3529
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
So good

3530
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
It's kind of a game where you launch

3531
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
This clown rag doll

3532
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Thing into the area

3533
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
And you collect balloons and stuff

3534
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
But it's

3535
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Really

3536
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Kinda cool

3537
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I just like the art style in it and everything

3538
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
But yeah, Carnivale

3539
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
I'm trying to think of some other ones

3540
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
That are actually pretty cool

3541
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
There

3542
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
There was one, oh god, what the hell was that?

3543
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
There was one

3544
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
It was

3545
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
It was some sort of

3546
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Obama

3547
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Fighting game or something like that

3548
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Oh dear

3549
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
What the hell was it?

3550
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
It was something ridiculous

3551
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
It was some dude that

3552
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Was

3553
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Running around and there would be people

3554
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Trying to attack you and you can

3555
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Pick up a bus and smash them with the bus

3556
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Oh, you showed me

3557
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Videos of that, I remember

3558
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
It looked like bad dudes or something

3559
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
It was pretty funny

3560
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Are you a bad enough dude to be the president?

3561
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Nice

3562
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Alright, well you think of some others

3563
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I don't know, I haven't really been on Indie Games

3564
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
In a while, so

3565
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
You'll have to remedy that soon, alright

3566
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Well anyway, let's talk about

3567
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
This is definitely not about Indie Games

3568
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
It's about games that people are looking forward to

3569
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Next year, the Nintendo 3DS

3570
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Is a huge, huge thing of course

3571
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
It's going to be about 2011

3572
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Because everything has to be in 3D in this day and age

3573
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
So the 3DS is getting a big

3574
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Public showing in February

3575
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
In Japan

3576
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
3DS will also be at the World Hobby Fair

3577
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
It's going to be at some Japanese shopping centers

3578
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Crazy, crazy

3579
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Excuse me, crazy stuff

3580
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
But here's some of the games

3581
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
That are going to be playable

3582
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
At this exhibition

3583
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Nintendo World 2011

3584
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000

3585
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Pro Evolution 3D Soccer

3586
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Street Fighter IV 3D

3587
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Resident Evil Revelations

3588
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Dynasty Warriors Chronicle

3589
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Dead or Alive Dimensions

3590
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Oh man, Dead or Alive Dimensions

3591
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Imagine those titties bouncing in full 3D

3592
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
It's going to be amazing

3593
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Ridge Racer 3D

3594
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle

3595
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Nintendogs plus Cats

3596
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D

3597
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Steel Diver Pilotwings Resort

3598
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
AR Games and the Nintendo 3DS

3599
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Camera

3600
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Now there's some other stuff that is not playable that's going to be shown

3601
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Kingdom Hearts 3D

3602
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Super Monkey Ball 3D

3603
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Puzzle Bobble 3D

3604
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Star Fox 64

3605
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Animal Crossing Mario Kart

3606
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
So on and so on

3607
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Probably the same shit we saw at E3

3608
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
But maybe with a new coat of paint

3609
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
I don't know

3610
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
By the way, most people are predicting it will be $2.99

3611
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
I'm going to say

3612
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
I agree with that, $2.99

3613
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
and the Zelda Ocarina of Time is the pack-in

3614
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Because it's a huge

3615
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
game without being

3616
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
a lot of money

3617
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
spent by Nintendo, you know what I mean?

3618
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
I think that will be the pack-in game

3619
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
The camera, the Zelda Ocarina of Time

3620
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
3D, maybe some samplers

3621
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
with some of these other trailers and so stuff

3622
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Other stuff, but it won't be Kid Icarus

3623
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I'll tell you that, that will not be the pack-in game

3624
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Alright

3625
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
And that's just

3626
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
I have nothing to go off of

3627
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Just what I think

3628
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Let's get to what you think in the mailbag

3629
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3630
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
is a place to send your emails every week

3631
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Dark Soccer will dive in the mailbag

3632
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
and pick some of her favorite emails

3633
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
and read them for us here on the air

3634
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I will

3635
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
But I think the holidays slowed people down, didn't it?

3636
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Yep

3637
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
This one, the OLR 2010 Predictions Forum thread

3638
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
We got next to nothing

3639
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
and mine were all wrong

3640
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
but thankfully so

3641
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I won't be posting

3642
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
a 2011 thread this year

3643
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I would like to mention a heavily self-biased list

3644
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
of some notable things that happened

3645
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Don't include the stuff if it was part of your year-end wrap-ups

3646
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
I'm gonna do it anyway

3647
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Well, we didn't even end up doing your year-end wrap-ups, so there you go

3648
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
2010 Slimeball Award

3649
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Activision

3650
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Dismantling of Infinity Ward was

3651
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
so as not to pay bonuses

3652
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
for a job while being gamefully employed

3653
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
is not a reason to fire them

3654
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
In fact, the games industry

3655
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
will be best served

3656
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
if you encourage career development across companies

3657
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
The decision was very profit-oriented

3658
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
and slimy

3659
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
One thing I hope the developer studios should have learned

3660
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
is to put in their contracts

3661
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
that bonuses are paid

3662
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
based on project, not employment

3663
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
2010 Last to the Party Award

3664
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Me! I joined Facebook in August

3665
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
2010

3666
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Developer of the Year, PopCap

3667
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Their games are not hard-hitting, but they sure are fun

3668
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
PopCap is really good at breathing new life

3669
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
into old games, plant versus zombies on new systems

3670
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
with new features, Bejeweled 3,

3671
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Zuma's Revenge, and Zuma Blitz

3672
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
2010 Welcome to the 21st Century Award

3673
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Steam

3674
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Steam made no-box direct sales of software

3675
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
worth it with their great prices

3676
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Think you shouldn't pay as much for a game

3677
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
because the cost of packaging and media isn't an issue?

3678
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Steam understands that

3679
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
The newest games are pricey, but their sales

3680
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
on right now make it affordable

3681
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
2010 Best Use of Meat

3682
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
in a Game's Title, Super Meat Boy

3683
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
They managed to use the initials SMB

3684
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
to hilarious effects

3685
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I'm looking forward to what you guys come up with

3686
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Ra-ba-buh

3687
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Ba-bom

3688
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
That's cute

3689
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Last one

3690
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Dear Peoples of the Intertubes

3691
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
You put out the call on Twitter for gaming-related

3692
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
New Year's resolutions. Well, most of my resolutions

3693
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
have to do with writing

3694
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
My only vaguely gaming-related one

3695
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
is to pay off my credit card, which I've

3696
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
only used to buy my two-year-old

3697
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
laptop. Besides, I don't make

3698
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
resolutions as much as I make goals. Goals

3699
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
tend not to have an expiration date that leads to

3700
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
disappointment in yourself. Stay black, redertainment

3701
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
This message was brought to you by

3702
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Windows 7, which totally fucked up my

3703
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
two-year-old laptop, sent for my iPad

3704
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Well, you gotta have the money to buy the games, so

3705
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Ah, good ol' reliable iPad

3706
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
And if you pay off your credit card, you can always

3707
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
run it all up again. Just kidding

3708
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
You know what I have noticed? Don't look too crazy. What?

3709
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
I have better luck sending emails from my iPhone

3710
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
than I do my PC sometimes. Really?

3711
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Because my iPhone has never crashed on me

3712
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Alright, well let's get to the FUs of the week

3713
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
I've had iPhone apps crash on me

3714
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
just so you know. I've had apps crash

3715
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
but there's no such thing as a BSOD

3716
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
on an iPhone. Yet

3717
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
But there is a such thing as the

3718
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
alarms suddenly not working on the iPhone

3719
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I don't know if you heard about that

3720
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
It's not a perfect world

3721
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Let's get to the FUs of the week

3722
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,000
FU to my back and now my butt

3723
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Because I was playing with my friend's son

3724
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
and he's heavy

3725
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
and I've wrenched my lower back

3726
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
and it's since settled in my right side

3727
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
I have a bad hip for the record

3728
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I've been in two car accidents

3729
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
and injured my hip both times

3730
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
and I'm in a lot of pain

3731
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I've taken significant Vicodin today

3732
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:30,000
significant, I won't say how much

3733
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
and um, I still hurt

3734
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
I'm walking around like I'm, you know, 90

3735
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
and I don't like it

3736
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Also, I FU'd to the tail end of this cold that refused to go away

3737
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,000
which makes me very antisocial and bitchy

3738
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Is that all?

3739
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Okay, Loki

3740
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
What's your FUs of the week, Loki?

3741
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
My FU of the week would be to

3742
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I don't know, the weather

3743
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
sucks

3744
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I don't really have anything

3745
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Uh, Gary

3746
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Do you have any FUs of the week?

3747
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Things that are making you mad?

3748
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I would have to

3749
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
agree with Loki on that one

3750
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
the weather around here has blown goats

3751
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
all days yesterday and today

3752
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I hate rain

3753
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
but I've said that before

3754
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I mean, other people will remind me

3755
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
that yes, we need it

3756
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
but still, it makes everything

3757
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
especially driving more difficult

3758
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
and

3759
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
yeah, that's the only one I want to say right now

3760
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
It can rain up in the hills

3761
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
and trickle down here

3762
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Well, it can rain, yeah, it can rain at night

3763
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
when I actually don't have to drive

3764
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
but, oh well, whatever, that's life

3765
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I don't think the environment cares if you're driving or not

3766
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I'm pretty sure it doesn't

3767
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
but I'm still frustrated all the same

3768
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Um, I would say

3769
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
FU to

3770
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Comcast!

3771
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
My internet provider

3772
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Comcast is evil

3773
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
My internet is still dropping out

3774
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I came out to my house last week

3775
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
to try to fix it

3776
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
and I'm still getting

3777
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
randomly dropped from the internet

3778
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
which is affecting my Warcraft playing

3779
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Sorry, you know

3780
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Jamie and I have a mutual friend who has Comcast

3781
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
and she's always complaining about issues with it

3782
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
so I can feel your pain on that one

3783
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Hey, at least the tech who came to my house

3784
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
was really nice, but I kind of got the sense

3785
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
in just what he was saying that

3786
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
yeah, this seems to be a problem in Comcast's office

3787
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
and I'm just really here to validate that there's a problem

3788
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
You know, like

3789
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
so frustrating

3790
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
At least nobody came into your neighborhood and snapped the main

3791
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
fiber optic cable

3792
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
You remember when that happened to me?

3793
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Well that's not Comcast though, that's just some jackass

3794
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
That's some asshole

3795
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
But anyhow, that's it for my FUs of the Week

3796
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Just FU to the fact I can't run instances

3797
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
and wow, because I always get disconnected

3798
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Rude and ignorant

3799
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Couple more news stories for you guys

3800
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
and then the Skype line 877-GAME-OLR

3801
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
but not just yet, we got two more stories for you

3802
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Mikey?

3803
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Yes, so

3804
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
to kind of wrap things up

3805
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
and this is surprising, thank God

3806
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
I haven't run across it probably because it's in a different region

3807
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
but Android

3808
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
the marketplace is getting a few games

3809
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
that are actually Trojan horses

3810
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
that are letting

3811
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I guess malicious hackers

3812
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
possibly use your phone as part of

3813
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
a botnet

3814
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Apparently in China

3815
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
on their app store, there's

3816
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I guess a few apps that are affected

3817
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
by this. Monkey Jump 2

3818
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Sex Positions

3819
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
President vs. Aliens

3820
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
and

3821
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
City Defense and

3822
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Baseball Superstars 2010

3823
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
It says they found

3824
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
these only right now on the Chinese app store

3825
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
but they're saying that

3826
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
it's possible that these may be coming

3827
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
to the other regions

3828
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
to just be on the lookout for them

3829
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
It says

3830
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Although the intent of this Trojan isn't entirely clear

3831
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
the possibilities range from setting up

3832
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
a malicious mobile ad network

3833
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
to creating an Android botnet

3834
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
They said that

3835
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
they're just kind of

3836
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
watching out. It says possibly affected apps

3837
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
could be posted to the app stores

3838
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
targeting US users

3839
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
in the future

3840
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
so just

3841
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
be on the lookout

3842
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
I worry about

3843
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
the day something like this happens to the iPhone

3844
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I mean Android's bad enough, there's enough people to use that

3845
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
but boy oh boy when something like this

3846
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
happens on iTunes

3847
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
That's true

3848
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
I mean everything does have to go through that rigid

3849
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
approval process with Apple

3850
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
but you just wonder when something's gonna slip through the cracks

3851
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
It will eventually

3852
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Of course they can always pull it

3853
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
once it gets out there

3854
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
I heard about that

3855
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
What was the one

3856
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
something about baby

3857
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
oh it was really bad, it was something like

3858
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
punching babies or something and somehow it got approved

3859
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
it was really terrible

3860
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Well some of you might feel a little terrible

3861
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
about this and it's always interesting

3862
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
to report on these type of like ROM

3863
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
types of stories but there's a part of me that sits here

3864
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
and goes okay seriously y'all this game

3865
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
is like 20 plus years old

3866
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
so let's talk about The Legend of Zelda

3867
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
on the Famicom

3868
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
or the Nintendo if you will

3869
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
You know when it came out on the Famicom

3870
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
it was actually a disc game

3871
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
and we didn't have it here in the US but some of the games

3872
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
for the original Japanese version

3873
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
of the Nintendo ran on the

3874
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Famicom disc system

3875
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
so they were like these little floppies

3876
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Well this week or I should say

3877
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
over the holiday at least it did come to light that there was

3878
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
a prototype of The Legend of Zelda

3879
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
on one of these discs

3880
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
so it was found and promptly uploaded

3881
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
to the internet and you can check this out for yourself

3882
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
it's a prototype of The Legend of Zelda

3883
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Here's the thing though guys

3884
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
honestly when I kind of heard about this I was like oh that's neat

3885
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
that there's a prototype out there for such a big game

3886
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
but not that much changed

3887
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
they changed some sprites

3888
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
slightly

3889
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
it's almost unnoticeable

3890
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
how they changed some of these sprites

3891
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
like some of the guys that bounce around

3892
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
didn't have whiskers before and they do now

3893
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
I mean there's really little stuff

3894
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
very very minor floor plans

3895
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
some reconfigurations

3896
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
but of course if you're a hardcore Legend of Zelda fan

3897
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
and if you grew up with this game

3898
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
it's kind of neat to see what once was

3899
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
so

3900
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
what's that? I'm downloading it

3901
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
of course you are

3902
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
it is available on this website

3903
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
called let's see

3904
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
it was originally put on this forums

3905
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
at lostlevels.org

3906
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
which I think gets into a lot of these types of

3907
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
prototype issues

3908
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
and I guess there's more information available as well

3909
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
on a website called the Cutting Room Floor

3910
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
TCRF.net

3911
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
which is a whole little like Wikipedia

3912
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
type thing that will detail all of the changes

3913
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
if you really want to know what rooms

3914
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
led different rooms and how the item

3915
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
drops were different. I mean they get into

3916
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
the real nitty gritty about

3917
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
this. Most people will just kind of go

3918
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
eh, neat, couple things are different

3919
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
so

3920
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
you know again if you're going to download stuff like this

3921
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
though you should consider you know at least owning

3922
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
a legitimate copy of this be it through

3923
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Virtual Console or one of the

3924
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
50,000 times Nintendo has released this

3925
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
games be it in compilations or what

3926
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
have you

3927
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
but I say you know what

3928
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
if as long as you have one of those

3929
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
other games or you've had at some point in your life

3930
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I think you're entitled to take a peek at this

3931
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
game.

3932
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Alright that is it for the

3933
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
news tonight. We're going to open up the

3934
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Skype line. Woohoo! Let's get some calls

3935
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
877-GAME-OLR or

3936
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

3937
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
first calls of 2011 before

3938
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
the delay is bigger tonight

3939
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
so it's about a minute so do we have any

3940
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
last minute stories while we wait for some calls to come in?

3941
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
No but I was going to talk you were

3942
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
asking about games that are good on the

3943
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
marketplace and I was just pulling up some

3944
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
that I thought might have been pretty good

3945
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
one that I was really addicted

3946
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
to Minor Dig Deep

3947
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
was a really good one on the indie marketplace

3948
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
and it's only a buck

3949
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
this one looked kind of funny

3950
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Try Not To Fart

3951
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
It looked awful. I saw the box art

3952
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
for that like how exactly

3953
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
do you not fart? I don't I think

3954
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
it's button presses you have to mimic the button

3955
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
presses but they have like you know

3956
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
like different situations eating dinner

3957
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
with like your girlfriend's parents

3958
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
or you know wedding

3959
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
I remembered one of the indie games

3960
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
that I played that was really really bad

3961
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
it was called Maids With Balloons

3962
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Oh I saw that! And it's

3963
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
it actually has like live motion

3964
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
video in it that they actually shot

3965
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
like in some guy's spare bedroom and it starts

3966
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
to look like a really really

3967
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
bad homemade porno with

3968
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
these three chicks and in

3969
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
made costumes that really need to be dry cleaned

3970
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
like just you know

3971
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
like trying to be all like sexy and

3972
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
so forth and

3973
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
wow it was

3974
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
it was kind of poop. Like I hate to

3975
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
you know I know we're supposed to support indie

3976
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
games and all that stuff but it's very

3977
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
clear what this game is all about and it's

3978
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
not the game. Sounds like epic fail

3979
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Yeah Insiders

3980
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Incite Lacrosse's college

3981
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
was it College Lacrosse 2010?

3982
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
That's a good one. Alright

3996
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
then so be it. What's on your mind tonight?

3997
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
That and there are weeks when I let people

3998
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
jump the line I don't even bother but

3999
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
a couple of things

4000
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I'll be on my merry little way

4001
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
now this whole court case

4002
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
with the whole NFL thing I'm hoping

4003
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
that the judge nullifies the contract

4004
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
because damn it I want my tech mobile

4005
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
NFL teams

4006
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Ah that would be nice you know I think

4007
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
competition is sometimes a little bit healthy

4008
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
you know what really frustrates me to no end about this

4009
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
whole Comcast stuff is that

4010
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
there's no real competition

4011
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
in this area I mean I guess

4012
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
we're starting to see more and more AT&T

4013
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
U-verse and some people would tell

4014
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
me oh well there's DSL and I'm

4015
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
actually getting to the point where I don't care if

4016
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
DSL is like a fourth as fast as

4017
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
cable I'm gonna fucking switch

4018
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
if they can't figure this problem out

4019
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
you know what I mean? I hear you

4020
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
DSL isn't as fast but it's just more

4021
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
dependable more reliable I mean

4022
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
that's part of the reason why I switched to fiber optic

4023
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
I mean yeah I got I had

4024
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
cable but you know what when the cable

4025
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
modem goes out at 12

4026
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
midnight during off peak hours

4027
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
for 5-10 minutes at a time

4028
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I'm switching to something else

4029
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
that's a lot better and besides

4030
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
FiOS TV

4031
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
pictures a lot sharper and a lot

4032
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
cleaner than what cable vision was offering

4033
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I don't even really watch TV it's all about Netflix

4034
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
and all that now but you know you live in New York

4035
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
City too where you probably have more options

4036
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
see being here in Sacramento

4037
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
it's not that Sacramento doesn't have like you know

4038
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
it's not like we're a potent town or one of the

4039
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I think what we're number 20 in the nation

4040
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
or something like that but I live a little bit

4041
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
on the outskirts of Sacramento so

4042
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I don't think I have as many options where I live

4043
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
I hear where you're coming from

4044
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
because where I am my options are either cable

4045
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
vision or Verizon

4046
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
you go in certain parts of New York City it's

4047
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
either Time Warner or Verizon

4048
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
and sometimes it's RCN or AT&T

4049
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
it depends on where you go

4050
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
big wang eater in our chat room is saying

4051
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
fucking switch, switch bitch

4052
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
I will switch to eating

4053
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
big wang that's why I will switch to

4054
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
how long ago did you switch to that?

4055
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
you opened the door

4056
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I plead the fifth

4057
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I plead the fifth

4058
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
well going back to the DSL

4059
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
part of the reason the DSL is better than

4060
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
cable is because with cable you're sharing bandwidth

4061
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
with everyone on your block whereas

4062
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
DSL just everyone in your house

4063
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
it's a slightly more manageable situation

4064
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
but yeah plus DSL

4065
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
speeds are getting up to where they can compete

4066
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
with cable's fastest speeds

4067
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
first question I'm going to ask the DSL people is

4068
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
can I play WoW on it?

4069
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
that's all I want

4070
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
and even with DSL speeds coming up

4071
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
you have to pay more for it

4072
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
but let's get back to gaming talk

4073
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
yeah sorry

4074
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
well hey it directly affects my games

4075
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
it's not just WoW

4076
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
it's Playstation Network and this whole

4077
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
White Knight Chronicles being online enabled

4078
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I can't keep a connection

4079
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
it's getting bad

4080
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
anyhow

4081
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
so what else is on your mind my friend anything else?

4082
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Arcade Infinity

4083
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
now before we get into that

4084
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
just so you know

4085
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Colt 45

4086
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
is a malt liquor not a beer

4087
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
so if you're going to pour a 40

4088
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
you're pouring a 40 of malt liquor

4089
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
you don't pour beer

4090
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
beer is tasty malt liquor

4091
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
not so much

4092
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
that's why I said

4093
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
an ice cold Colt

4094
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
can is the same to me unless it's Guinness

4095
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
but Guinness is better out of a bottle truth

4096
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
true that true that

4097
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
even better on tap

4098
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
that's true more truth

4099
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
so alrighty

4100
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Rama I'm going to go ahead and let you go

4101
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
but wait actually one more question

4102
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
because I'm going to ask this of all our callers tonight

4103
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
your favorite game of last year using any

4104
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
criteria you want there is no right or wrong answer

4105
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World the game

4106
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
because

4107
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
it was the only game

4108
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I played more than any other game

4109
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
of all of last year it just

4110
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
brought me back to my favorite

4111
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
beat em ups I mean this is a game

4112
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
where people would just come over

4113
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
it was like the number 2 game in my house next to rock band

4114
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I want you to get people together and have fun

4115
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
this is like I felt like I was like 10

4116
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
11 12 years old playing

4117
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
playing this game you know

4118
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
nothing's wrong with that fun is where it's at

4119
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
got that right alright Rama you have a good one

4120
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000

SSG100 Matt

4125
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
in our chatroom says Guinness is a meal really

4126
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
well yeah I mean well it's liquid bread

4127
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I suppose you could look

4128
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
at it that way there's no other last minute

4129
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
stories in house we've got nothing but calls

4130
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
to go on

4131
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
well I was going to make more recommendations

4132
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
sure give us a couple more while we wait for some calls

4133
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
shoot one up

4134
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
that's supposed to be a really good one

4135
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
and that's pretty

4136
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
cheap explosion aid

4137
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
was another good one that was by the guys that did

4138
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
weapon of choice and really

4139
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
cool looking shooter game here comes a call

4140
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this

4141
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
legend nazaku here hello my friend

4142
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
how are you doing

4143
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
doing pretty good what's on your mind buddy

4144
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
nah I know

4145
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
adam mentioned arcade infinity you probably already

4146
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
covered this to death but

4147
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
the way I see it is that

4148
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I'm surprised it managed to go this

4149
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
long given

4150
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
the fact that you know round

4151
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
one pretty much was there

4152
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
pretty much was the

4153
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
was a death blow to them

4154
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
and don't get me don't get me wrong with

4155
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
round one at least they're like an authentic

4156
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
japanese entertainment center to an

4157
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
extent and they're

4158
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
they do a lot better than d&b but

4159
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
I don't know it's like the arcades are

4160
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
pretty much dead at this point I hate

4161
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
to say it they're dead they're just not

4162
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
dying they're they're pretty much dead

4163
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
it's funny you bring up d&b

4164
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
because I was at dave and busters this week

4165
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
and it's still it's still kicking there's still quite a

4166
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
lot of corporate owned I'm

4167
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
talking about like mom and pop

4168
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
operations like arcade infinity

4169
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I gotcha

4170
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
like those on their way out

4171
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
the rest of them are pretty much on death row

4172
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
unless of course you're in

4173
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
you know you have foot traffic but

4174
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
yeah it's a disaster state of affairs now

4175
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
it just

4176
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
you know it doesn't make sense when

4177
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
you know

4178
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
I get

4179
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
the way no I get what you're

4180
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
saying you know sadly it's one of those things where you know

4181
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
yeah we covered the story here and it was kind of one

4182
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
of those oh that's kind of

4183
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
sad but it's also not surprising

4184
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I mean that's just you're right arcades

4185
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
have been kind of going this way and there's

4186
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
there's not been a lot that's really made us

4187
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
have to go oh we've got to go to the arcade and have

4188
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
that experience because now we have

4189
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
the internet you know and

4190
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
even it's it's so weird

4191
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
because OLR started because

4192
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
of arcade culture and

4193
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
that couldn't happen today

4194
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
and it's kind of sad

4195
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
in a way but even our little

4196
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
arcade culture has moved to the internet

4197
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
in its own little way and it's not

4198
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
like the internet didn't exist then because we used to have

4199
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
our own little forums the sacramentals

4200
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
were our little DDR team and so

4201
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
forth which wasn't really a team it was just you know

4202
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
kids that played DDR but

4203
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
you know it wasn't

4204
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
like what we have now with

4205
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Xbox Live I would

4206
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
go so far as to say things like Xbox Live and

4207
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
MMOs that's what really killed the arcade

4208
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
right but then

4209
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
again I've been hearing it

4210
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
from other arcade owners that I know

4211
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
that you know it's a dying industry

4212
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
it's pretty much

4213
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
on its days are pretty much numbered

4214
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
and I know that I mean

4215
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
somebody has to innovate somewhere

4216
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
and of course I don't know what that answer is

4217
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
or I'd be a freaking millionaire but

4218
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
surely there is something where people

4219
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
would want to do it in person you know what I mean

4220
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
there's got to be something that will

4221
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
get people I always want to do it in person

4222
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
it's just you know

4223
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
what I mean the folks who run

4224
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
the classic arcades they're probably going to be

4225
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
around for a while as long as that

4226
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
as long as that generation of

4227
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
folks who used to play those types

4228
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
of older games even the newer ones

4229
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
they'll still

4230
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
be a place for those types of arcades

4231
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
even ours even a place like

4232
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
AI someone will

4233
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
someone will step up eventually

4234
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
and just you know pick up the torch

4235
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
where they left off as well you know

4236
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
as long as they're right as long as

4237
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
they're like running a tight

4238
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
ship I gotta say this

4239
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I gotta say this though too I mean let's be

4240
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
real AI also

4241
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
it was in kind of a shitty location

4242
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
right round one it didn't

4243
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
really have a lot of advertising

4244
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
and I realized it was an independent thing but

4245
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
unless you were kind of on the internet

4246
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
I had no idea about this place

4247
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
until I was like online and

4248
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
posting on DDR boards

4249
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
it's not even that I heard they were getting

4250
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
flack from the city like they were

4251
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
they were like really hesitant about

4252
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
renewing their licenses wow

4253
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
sad right and not a couple with

4254
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
the fact that their landlord

4255
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
you know raised their rent

4256
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
constantly you know

4257
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
raised their rent to the point where they were

4258
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
gonna they had no choice but to be driven

4259
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
out that you know and then round one

4260
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
showed up so it was like so

4261
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
many forces and the

4262
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
they pretty much were

4263
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
there were so many

4264
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
aspects responsible for their demise

4265
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
and it's like I don't

4266
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
want to like clog up this precious Skype

4267
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
time just debating it if you look on

4268
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
those forums the fighting game forums

4269
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
even your Bobani forums

4270
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
you'll find the answers from people

4271
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
who actually who have

4272
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
more deeper knowledge than I do

4273
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
that's what I hear let me ask you I've been asking

4274
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
everybody else tends to wrap up and get more calls

4275
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
what was your favorite game of all last

4276
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
year any criteria you want uh

4277
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
let me see

4278
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
any criteria would that

4279
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
be I'm thinking

4280
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
I'm thinking bad company too

4281
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
why is that because I think

4282
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
just because of its crack like addictions like

4283
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
especially the multiplayer

4284
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
where it's all even though it's

4285
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
team based it's just like on the PC

4286
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
there's no ass hattery there's

4287
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
like everyone helps everyone

4288
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
fights no one quits

4289
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
I wish there could be less ass

4290
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
hattery in online games that is

4291
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
one thing I would say Red Dead Redemption

4292
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
but I just started that game a few days ago

4293
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
that is one thing I will say that arcades

4294
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
always kind of have over

4295
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
uh the uh

4296
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
online stuff is that online

4297
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
you can hide behind your monitor but in

4298
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
arcades if you're gonna be an asshole you have to be an

4299
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
asshole to people's faces

4300
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
that's one thing I do this at arcades

4301
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
alright Zaku I gotta let you go so we can get more calls

4302
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
have a good one buddy

4303
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
I have a podcast where they discuss

4304
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
the game but I haven't heard any of their shows

4305
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
yet because I don't want to download iTunes

4306
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
but um yeah I think yeah I've heard something like

4307
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
that and uh my game of the decade is

4308
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Grand Theft Auto IV I think

4309
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
that's just one of the best games ever made

4310
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
in my opinion I don't

4311
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
understand where all the hate for it came

4312
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
from you know

4313
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
no Loki would be right there with you buddy

4314
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Loki Grand Theft Auto IV game of the decade

4315
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
possibly maybe

4316
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
um it's pretty good

4317
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
I don't know if I

4318
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
yeah you had people complaining about the water

4319
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
I think that was some of the best

4320
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
computer generated water I've ever

4321
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
slammed into the game and I can't believe people even

4322
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
hated that I don't know it's just a weird

4323
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
hate for that game I think when that's

4324
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
like if you're complaining about the water

4325
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
above everything else like really

4326
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
that's kind of a stretch you know

4327
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
I can think of games that have many more problems

4328
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
than the water yeah they complain

4329
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
about the water and the driving just because you couldn't

4330
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
just you couldn't speed down uh

4331
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
down the street at like 200

4332
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
miles a minute you know

4333
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
without uh you know they claim that

4334
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
that was also a problem with the game I don't know I love the game

4335
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
but anyway uh what else I want to get

4336
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
to is arcades you asked about innovation

4337
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
yeah and I think that uh

4338
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
the way they'll probably be able

4339
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
to save it is uh virtual reality

4340
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
like some type of

4341
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
apparatus that I know they already have something like that

4342
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
but they need something where you'll have a

4343
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
group of people that'll stand in it and there'll be some type of

4344
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
multiplayer aspect I think that multiplayer

4345
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
to the arcade will actually

4346
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
be something that might be able to save it

4347
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
so the holodeck

4348
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
yeah yeah pretty much yeah the holodeck

4349
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
that'll save

4350
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
the arcades I think or maybe even

4351
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
motion control I don't know

4352
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
I find it kind of fascinating in a way that you're

4353
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
calling in to talk about saving arcades and you

4354
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
also kind of in the same sentence say

4355
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
mag is the best game that you played last year

4356
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
mag is very interesting

4357
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
because it's it's

4358
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
not an MMO

4359
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
you can't really call it just some multiplayer online

4360
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
game either it's like a

4361
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
it's just it's a brawl

4362
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
you know what I mean

4363
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
yeah it's really great I mean

4364
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
I think as far as

4365
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
first person shooters go

4366
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
that's the main reason why I like mag was just because

4367
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
it was very innovative they were doing something

4368
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
that you're not seeing in call of duty

4369
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
that you're not even seeing in halo

4370
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
and you know I just can't believe

4371
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
how people just

4372
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
knock any type of new innovation that comes out of

4373
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
you know if the first person shooter is not call of

4374
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
duty they knock it down

4375
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
and you know

4376
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
you know if the game is in

4377
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
well what's the other big game that they

4378
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
have out there that

4379
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
people seen the

4380
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
halo I'm drawing a blank

4381
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
oh wow there you go yeah

4382
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
if it's not wow it also gets shot down black ops

4383
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
it's like you could only

4384
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
yeah it's like you could only make those two games it's like you can only

4385
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
make call of duty for shooters and you

4386
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
could only make wow for

4387
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
MMOs you know it's like the only

4388
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
two games in existence in people's minds

4389
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
I mean don't

4390
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
get me wrong I like wow I think wow is great

4391
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
but I've also played other MMOs

4392
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
and I think you know they should also get

4393
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
a chance you know I think they're

4394
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
great games do you think there's a way

4395
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
I'm just a gamer period do you think

4396
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
there's a way to bring the magic of

4397
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
mag and what makes that game exciting for you

4398
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
to an arcade or do you think that

4399
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
that 64 player brawl

4400
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
experience is something you can really only do

4401
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
online and only ever do online

4402
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
I don't know you can bring something like

4403
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
mag to an arcade

4404
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
you couldn't have 128 people

4405
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
versus 128 people but

4406
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
you know you could probably have like a little

4407
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
skirmish of like maybe

4408
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
four people versus another four

4409
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
people almost like a laser tag

4410
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
you know what it could be

4411
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
you could still use the internet in it

4412
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
but it could be like city versus city

4413
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
or something like that like you know

4414
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Sacramento local

4415
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
arcade could take on the New York

4416
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
City you know

4417
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
58th street arcade

4418
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
I don't even know what's on 58th street I just pulled the number out of my ass

4419
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
arcade you know what I mean like wouldn't that be

4420
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
kind of cool like you could go like

4421
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
yeah I agree yeah I agree with that

4422
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
like I said my multiplayer is where it's at

4423
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
man that's gonna save the

4424
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
arcades if they want to save it I mean I gave

4425
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
up on arcades after Street Fighter 2

4426
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000

4466
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
hi this is Akdeft

4467
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
hey Akdeft haven't heard from you in a long time

4468
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
what's up?

4469
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
nothing much you guys want to talk about

4470
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
some games sure

4471
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
what's up?

4472
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
have you tried or have any of you tried

4473
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
the

4474
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
mexican wrestling game

4475
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
AAA

4476
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I have not tried it

4477
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
and I'm going to assume the other folks in the studio

4478
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
probably haven't either but why don't you tell us all about it

4479
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
I think if we knew more about it I think Dan would play it

4480
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
well it's a

4481
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
pretty interesting game

4482
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
well basically

4483
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
it's wrestling but

4484
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
you have many

4485
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
professional mexican wrestlers

4486
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
and it's actually a pretty fun

4487
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
game to play on multiplayer

4488
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
is it like full on with all the theatrics

4489
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
and masks and everything?

4490
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
yeah oh that's awesome

4491
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
yeah it actually

4492
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
captures all the mexican

4493
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
wrestling thing well

4494
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
the action and all the

4495
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
things that happen

4496
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
on mexican wrestling the drama

4497
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
yeah the drama

4498
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
well basically

4499
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
even the audience

4500
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
plays a factor

4501
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
well

4502
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
plays in the game

4503
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
not actually playing but

4504
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
it plays a factor in the game

4505
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
was this the game you were

4506
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
telling us about previously that was actually developed in

4507
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
mexico?

4508
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
yes it was developed by

4509
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
mexicans and columbians

4510
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I think

4511
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
it was I think

4512
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
published by konami

4513
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
on the united states

4514
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
awesome speaking of interesting

4515
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
things published by konami I know this is

4516
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
completely random but I have to get that out

4517
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
at some point is that I was

4518
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
at dave and busters over the weekend I think I mentioned

4519
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
one of the things I played while I was there

4520
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
it was a wheel of fortune ticket spitting

4521
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
machine where you like guess the puzzle and everything

4522
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
it was made by konami

4523
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
couldn't believe it I didn't realize they had the license to do that

4524
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
type of thing but they do a lot of arcade

4525
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
stuff or uh redemption type of

4526
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
things like slot machines and so forth

4527
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
you said this was triple A

4528
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
oh yeah

4529
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
she's looking at a video here in the studio right now

4530
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
of this game

4531
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
yeah this

4532
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
looks sick

4533
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
triple A

4534
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
or triple A

4535
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
okay I think this

4536
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
is immediately awesome

4537
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
hmm

4538
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
I'm just watching the intro of it that looks really cool

4539
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
where's the gameplay okay I see that they

4540
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
have some over the top wrestlers

4541
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
oh it's the guy in the skeleton suit I love

4542
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
that little creepy yeah he's called

4543
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
la parka oh this is sweet

4544
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
dark soccer is gonna be uh

4545
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
getting her wrestling on okay

4546
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
I actually like wrestling games believe it or not

4547
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
cause I like customizing a wrestler

4548
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
I think oh yeah

4549
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
if you like wrestling games

4550
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
you're gonna love this well we

4551
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
used to get um all of

4552
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
the uh the WWF or WWE

4553
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
ones but cause the the big

4554
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
thing about it is that because um

4555
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
some of the publishing went overseas

4556
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
is that they'd actually have some of the big moves from

4557
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
some of the Japanese wrestlers

4558
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
and we would you could

4559
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
actually unlock like take all

4560
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
these different parts and recreate

4561
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
official you know Japanese wrestlers

4562
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
in it and it was really awesome and

4563
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
I remember okay do you remember WrestleMania

4564
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
2000?

4565
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
kinda for the Nintendo 64

4566
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
yes I made this one

4567
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
wrestler who was a

4568
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
degeneration X guy and we had

4569
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
him fight everybody and you know just

4570
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
on like the watch mode and he beat everybody

4571
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
including getting the women's belt

4572
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
but

4573
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
I also I like to do with those

4574
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
games is just like make somebody and then just have

4575
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
them go in watch mode on all of the

4576
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
things I think that would be fun

4577
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
alright Act F I got

4578
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
one more question for you and that would be what was the

4579
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
best game you played all last year using any criteria

4580
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
you want?

4581
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I didn't play that many games this year

4582
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
well last year

4583
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
but I think what game that

4584
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
I really found

4585
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
interesting it was

4586
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
it is

4587
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
BB BB BB

4588
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
or 6B

4589
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
ah yes I heard you mention this in chat what was so great about it?

4590
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
well it's actually

4591
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
a pretty simple game

4592
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
it's a simple platformer

4593
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
though you control

4594
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
you don't jump you don't

4595
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
do any

4596
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
spectacular thing like in Mario

4597
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
or any platform like that

4598
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
you control the gravity

4599
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
you can go up or down

4600
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
but you can't jump

4601
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
or can't move

4602
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
according to what you want to do

4603
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
so you have to calculate

4604
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
what you're going to do

4605
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
if you're going to fall you have to

4606
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
well

4607
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
be very lucky or

4608
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
some kind of

4609
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
somewhat skilled

4610
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
so you don't die because

4611
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
many of the rooms are filled with spikes

4612
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
that's why it's called

4613
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
ah got it

4614
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
interesting

4615
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
it's also very cheap I think it's

4616
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
$5 I think

4617
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
and it's a pretty complete game

4618
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
I think it's the best game

4619
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
I played last year

4620
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
simple jet innovative

4621
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
alright great

4622
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
I like hearing about some new games

4623
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
and things that you know maybe some of the rest of us

4624
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
missed so I think that's a great pick

4625
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
alright buddy we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show

4626
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000

4627
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000

alright that's going to do it for the skype line tonight

4629
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
thank you guys so much for calling

4630
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
sorry to those that didn't get through

4631
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
it's always inevitable like it doesn't ring

4632
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
for like 5 minutes and then suddenly it's ringing off the hook at the end

4633
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
please feel free to email us

4634
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000

4636
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
for next week

4637
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
anyhow all joking aside

4638
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
we got to wrap up the show and get out of here for the night

4639
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
some of us have to get back to work tomorrow

4640
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
bright and early

4641
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts

4642
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
since I believe we are done with the last minute stories tonight

4643
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
hey Gary thanks for being here

4644
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
I know sadly you didn't get a whole lot of chance

4645
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
to shout at us with the news

4646
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
and everything with what's going on but

4647
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000

tabletop adventures too

4650
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
I appreciate it yeah I wish I had more time

4651
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
to play video games

4652
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
there's a lot going on right now

4653
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
hopefully I'll be able to get a hold of some

4654
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
more time and some more games in the future

4655
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
but yeah I want to finish Batman Arkham Asylum

4656
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
before Arkham City comes out later this year

4657
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
and I also wanted to try Transformers

4658
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
War for Cybertron so I haven't gotten to that one yet either

4659
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
I'll give you an assignment

4660
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
for the next time you come on the show

4661
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
at some point you got to find us that tabletop

4662
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
game that you think is the most accessible to somebody

4663
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
who's been playing the types of games

4664
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
we play here that's going to be

4665
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
a challenge to say the least

4666
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
there you go there's your homework

4667
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
okay accepted

4668
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000

4672
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
