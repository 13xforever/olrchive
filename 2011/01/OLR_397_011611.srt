Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Who's your hosts?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, January 16th, 2011

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Another MMO is set to go free to play this month

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
An upcoming fighting game plans to punish rage quitters

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And will the 3DS be region locked after all?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The show where every gamer has a voice

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We tape live at All Games Radio

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you for the next few hours

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Along with my co-host, not here tonight sadly

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is absent from the studio tonight

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
She may be coming about halfway through the show

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But she is out at a pinball collecting type of event

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a private thing so it's not something you would have read about on the internet

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But she's having a pretty good time

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know I got a text from her earlier today

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That she met some famous pinball maker

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So hopefully she makes it back in time during the show

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And we can ask her all about her experience there

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I know there was beer involved

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't think there's any beer involved though

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
With our other co-hosts tonight

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How you doing, Loki?

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm doing fine

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Alright, what's new in your world?

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How's the baby? How's the wife?

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Uh, baby's fine

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And wife is doing fine

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't know if she's over at her mom's house right now

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She visits her every day

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Or, well, every Sunday

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's awesome that you guys have a Sunday planned

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So you can kind of keep doing the show

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We'd be screwed without Loki

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
She doesn't always get over there

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I still come here

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's move on to a special guest joining us tonight

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Who's going to be filling in for Dark Sakura

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now, Dark Sakura

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Her position could never be filled

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But he's going to try

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Say hello everybody to Salacious Pop

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hello

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
How are you Salacious Pop?

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm great

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm pinch hitting for Jamie and I get to read stories

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It'll be fun

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If anyone hears a thud

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's because Rob threw a shoe at me

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Because I missed my story cue

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I'm letting there be dead air

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So if you hear thud

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Stuff happened today

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's what happened there

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Just looking forward to it

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Again, I don't know how long Dark Sakura's going to be out

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She didn't really give a firm time

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Because I think she just kind of didn't know

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You know, sometimes you get invited to those things

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And you're like, I don't know

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And I get the sense that it might be a little far away

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It might be in the Bay Area

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So if they haven't even left the par-tay yet

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She might be gone for a while

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, so she might show up and just be like

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You get the hell up out my seat

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Give me my mic and get out

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And that's when I'm going to, you know, bail to the living room

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com where we have the live chatters

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Every Sunday night while we do tape

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm noticing

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
ActDeaf in our chat room says, DarkSakura ain't home

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Party!

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Actually, it is a little weird

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We're in her house right now

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And she's very kind

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Her and Dan, really, because he lives here too

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Letting us kind of come in and do our show anyway

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I have the super secret way of getting in the house

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
When they're not here that I can't say

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Because, you know, we don't want the robbers to show up

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But yeah, she's very kind

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And letting us kind of take over the house

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But it's a little weird, I think

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
To be in someone's house when they're not here

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And it's not like a house sitting type of thing

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Like, I didn't feed Shermy

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Shermy doesn't need to be fed

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Shermy's just asleep, Shermy don't give a shit tonight

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But anyhow, alright

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Enough talk about being in the house when the owners aren't home

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And kiddies and so forth

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's talk about video games

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And we'll start off tonight with how is your gaming week

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We have to mix it up a little bit tonight because DarkSakura's not here

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So we'll start with Loki, how was your gaming week?

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It was alright, I didn't play

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
A ton of things, we have

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The new mod games going for Grand Theft Auto

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So we've been playing that this week

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's weird though, we've been running into a bunch of

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Strange glitches and I'm not really sure

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What it's from, I think it might be

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Some leftover data that's in the save files

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Or something, but

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We have it set to all of our

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Cop cars are flying around and stuff

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But for some reason when we're playing

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The single player game, some of the cop cars

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't fly, so it makes me think

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That some of the old data is in there

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And then also we've been having issues

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
With cars disappearing on us

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So it'll look like we're flying around

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And we're impervious to fire in free mode

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
For some reason, and it's odd

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Because I didn't even touch any of those files

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That would affect that, so

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's just a bunch of strange glitches

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But I'm working on it

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And then other than that

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I played a little bit of

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What did I play this week actually?

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, I tried a bit of

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Angry Birds because I've had it

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Purchased on my

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
iPod for the longest time now

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And I gotta admit, I don't

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't understand it, I don't understand what the

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Big draw is, it's alright, it's

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Kind of fun, but

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I got bored of it really quick

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So I don't know why everyone's

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So gung-ho about it and like

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Have this big raging heart on for the game

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Because it's not that great

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm not sure I understand America's

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Obsession with Angry Birds either

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's okay, it's

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
For an iPhone game, it's fine

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But it's not something like, oh my god

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's gotta warrant movie rights

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And shit like that

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And shirts, I went into Hot Topic the other day

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There's Angry Birds shirts now

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Like really?

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I thought Cut the Rope was cuter

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Because I like the om nom nom

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I just don't get it, I mean

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't know, like

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I've played a lot of addictive games

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If anything, I think Plants vs. Zombies

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Serves more of

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You know, movie rights and that kind of stuff

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Versus, you know, stupid

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Angry Birds

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'd rather have Angry Birds shirts than

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Farmville bottled water

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And hot dogs, which is very real

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
At 7-Eleven, so

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, that's a bit absurd though

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
For a casual game like that

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And then other things I played this week

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I just realized it's my move

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
In Words with Friends

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Which is a much more addicting iPhone game

175
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Than Angry Birds

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll tell you, the only thing that pisses me off

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
About Words with Friends is people that start random games with me

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Because I guess there's no way to like

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Take your name out of the random game pool

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I'm like, I don't want to play games with people I don't know

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You know?

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Especially things like Scrabble

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And then there's a chat feature in it

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Like, you know, don't talk to me

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
My friends at work have been consumed by Words with Friends

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So I have yet to play that

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There was some other stuff that I played that was kind of cool

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've just been downloading a bunch of random things

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I actually downloaded today

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It was kind of cool

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Earth Defense Force

192
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Not the Earth Defense Force that I've

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Come to love

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But the old Earth Defense Force game

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That was on

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The Super Nintendo

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Which I think came out over here

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I want to say UN Squadron

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I think was the name of it over here

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh god, I loved UN Squadron

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The old it?

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That was a Capcom game years ago

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think that's the one

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It looks similar, I could be wrong

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I think it's that game

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But then there was another one I downloaded

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Raptor Call of Shadows

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Which is an old shareware game

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
From way back in the day

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
From Apogee

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So that was pretty sweet

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So I downloaded that

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What else did I play?

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Funny enough I was actually playing some

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Technically I guess it's a game

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Because it's an app and it's

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Questions

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But I've been playing the

219
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I don't know why I'm obsessed with this now

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The Mensa

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Test quiz

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Type stuff on there

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because I guess I scored pretty high on the website thing

224
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So now I'm actually going to try

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm a Mensa member

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm really smart you guys

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm not a member

228
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I have to take the test

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I can be a certified

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Genius that way, no?

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Ray Ayanami in our chat room says

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Area 88 slash UN Squadron

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
NACDEF says UN Squadron does not equal

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Earth Defense Force

235
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It just looks similar

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I know there's something else I played

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think I may have played a little bit of Swords and Poker

238
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's pretty fun

239
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I haven't really been doing a whole ton of gaming

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mainly Grand Theft Auto

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mainly Grand Theft Auto

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, and actually I did try

243
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There was a video that was out earlier this week

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Of people playing Grand Theft Auto

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Where they had the cars

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Didn't really have any

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Friction on them

248
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So they just kind of went wacky

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And started flying around

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Everywhere and it's very chaotic

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So I actually have my PC game set up like that

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Right now

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It was something I was going to be trying out

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Even before I saw that video

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There was this guy

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Who goes by the name Shadow on the boards

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That I'm on that he did that

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And there was another mod that he did that was kind of funky

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Like that

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm actually probably going to apply those to the

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Ballet of the Gay Tony stuff

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We've only been playing Lost in Damned

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So it'd be fun to

264
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Add that to it

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And then also apparently they're going to be releasing

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Script editing tools soon

267
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Which just opens up the realm of possibilities

268
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
For Grand Theft Auto modding to

269
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
All sorts of crazy lengths

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I mean because if we have access to

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Edit the scripts we can pretty much

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Do whatever we want in the game

273
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Which is pretty awesome so

274
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm very excited to see what comes of that

275
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's about it

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Alright

277
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
SalaciousPop how was your gaming week?

278
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What kind of games did you play this week?

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
My gaming week is pretty embarrassing

280
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Not much to talk about

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Lots of wow

282
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You want me to talk about that at length

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll go on your other podcast

284
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So just leveling up my main

285
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And doing Cataclysm stuff

286
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I got a 1600 point

287
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Gift card for XBLA

288
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I finally used it for Christmas

289
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So I finally used it and I picked up the

290
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Scott Pilgrim game

291
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The River City Ransom clone

292
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So I tinkered with that a bit

293
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And then I also used it to get

294
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The Pac-Man Championship Edition DX

295
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And I also

296
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Have played some

297
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Plants vs. Zombies

298
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Game of the Year edition

299
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Which was left over from the Steam sale

300
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
When I picked it up for like 4 bucks

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Over Christmas and then

302
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Poker Night at the inventory

303
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And I'm now 60 grand in the hole

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Again in my global stat

305
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So I need to win 2 rounds

306
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So that's frustrating

307
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Have you unlocked everything in your Poker Night game yet?

308
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I still have lots of table tops and card decks

309
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
To unlock, about 4 left of each

310
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I know Bobby

311
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio

312
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He talked at length tonight about

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Back to the Future, the new Telltale

314
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Game that came out. Do you have any interest in

315
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Back to the Future games?

316
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I haven't played any of the Sam & Max

317
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And I loved the original one when it was on the

318
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
SCUMM engine, so all of the Telltale

319
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Episodic ones, I haven't

320
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Really messed with those at all

321
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And there's also

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The

323
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The episodic game that I'm really looking forward to

324
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Isn't Telltale, sadly, but it's the Penny Arcade one

325
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Precipice of Darkness

326
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
On their website

327
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They wrote the third volume

328
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
As an actual

329
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Like they wrote it out like a fanfiction

330
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So I guess the third one was just

331
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Scrapped because they wrote it out instead

332
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Like a book

333
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
They had the first game and the second game

334
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It was kind of a back and forth thing

335
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Because I remember reading some things about it

336
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Where there was a joke on Twitter

337
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
About, you know, if so many people

338
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Will buy this game when it's discounted, then we'll make the third game

339
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And the Penny Arcade guys basically came out and said

340
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Actually, that's not true. There's not going to be a third game

341
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Basically. I don't know if it's a sales thing

342
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I completely missed when that was made official

343
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
All this time for the last three years, I was like

344
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
When are we getting volume three?

345
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But they just wrote it. Sorry. Oh, alright.

346
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Alright, so that's all

347
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Fans vs. Zombies and

348
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Poker Night. It's kind of like when a show on TV

349
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Gets cancelled and you can like

350
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Maybe the producer will write something on the internet

351
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Or you can watch the rest of the episodes

352
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
On CBS.com or whatever

353
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
When you desperately hope that they

354
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Were able to squeeze out two or three

355
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Episodes to wrap it up

356
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
After they get cancelled, it's like, no

357
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The seventh episode is it. There's no closure at all

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What was that freaking show I actually

359
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Watched? I think it was

360
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Harper's Island or something. It was on TV

361
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It was like a murder mystery

362
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Somebody dies every week and I think it got cancelled

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
By CBS like halfway through and he had to finish

364
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Watching it on CBS.com

365
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And it was actually

366
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Not that good of a show. I don't know why I

367
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Watched it every week and it had

368
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Kind of a crappy, guessable ending but whatever

369
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Probably the same reason we watched the Tester

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Probably, probably. Hey

371
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You know what, actually the Tester, the second

372
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Season of the Tester was probably a little better

373
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Than Harper's Island and less predictable

374
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Sadly

375
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There you go

376
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
All sorts of embarrassing TV shows

377
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Speaking of embarrassing fandom, I will say the Telltale

378
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Game I'm actually looking forward to is Jurassic Park

379
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Like I'm really curious to see what they

380
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Do with it. It's such a weird license

381
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
In some ways for them to have

382
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But I'm kind of excited to see kind of what they do with it

383
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Do you guys remember like the Jurassic Park games

384
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
From what they had on Super Nintendo

385
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Remember the Super Nintendo Jurassic Park game?

386
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It was all, yeah it was kind of cool

387
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But at the same time it was a little

388
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Bit junky, I mean

389
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I remember two games that came out

390
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Both platformers that were night

391
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And day between the Super Nintendo

392
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And Genesis versions

393
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And it was completely different

394
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And Aladdin, when people put on Aladdin

395
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
For the Genesis it's like, this is amazing

396
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And Jurassic Park was the same way

397
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Way better on the Genesis

398
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, Jurassic Park, well I believe Jurassic Park you had to play

399
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The dinosaur, it was like, wasn't that kind of

400
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The trick to it? You could play the dinosaur

401
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Or you could play the doctor

402
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And it was kind of a cool thing

403
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Super Nintendo 1 had more of like

404
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
A Zelda-esque overworld

405
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And I use that term very loosely

406
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But then when you would go into the caves

407
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The dungeons were DOOM basically

408
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But it was kind of like

409
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You know, at that time we didn't have a lot of

410
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
First person shooter type games

411
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And I believe it was one of the earliest games to use surround sound

412
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So you know, if you had a pretty good surround system

413
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That game was really kind of scary

414
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You know, at least for a kid

415
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Who was playing on the Super Nintendo

416
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So, anyhow, we'll stop talking about

417
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Games from 15 years ago

418
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And talk about something a little more current

419
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
My Gaming Week, sadly not a lot of

420
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
New stuff, you know again mostly

421
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Wow and My World as well

422
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Still playing a little bit of Fallout 3

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
As well as some other miscellaneous things here and there

424
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Not a lot of new stuff I tried out

425
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I did kind of go to the Indie Store

426
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And I tried a few games on the Xbox Live Indie Game Store

427
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because you know, there's some gems out there once in a while

428
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You'll find some

429
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And I always feel bad giving games on the Indie Store

430
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Negative reviews because

431
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You know, we do an independent thing here

432
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And I feel like we should support other independent games

433
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But sometimes there's just games

434
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I really have a hard time justifying

435
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And one of them is this game called

436
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Maids with Balloons, have you seen this game?

437
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
On the Xbox Live Indie

438
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Marketplace

439
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know how to explain it

440
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It looks like a bad CD-ROM

441
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Game from like when CD-ROM

442
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Would first came out where they

443
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Did these full motion movies

444
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Or whatever and it looks like these

445
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Guys who made the game rented a room

446
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
At Motel 6 and got their friends

447
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
To dress up in maid outfits

448
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And just act out these scenes

449
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Pay them in drinks

450
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Didn't even pay them in cash

451
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
They got their three cute girlfriends to dress in maid outfits

452
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And pay them in drinks

453
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And it was like, Skidamax movies

454
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Have more plot than this thing did

455
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And then you go into the game itself

456
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And it's like you're trying to launch balloons

457
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Up at seagulls

458
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So they don't poop on you

459
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's a really terrible shooter from

460
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The 80s, Atari 2600 caliber

461
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If someone submitted this game

462
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
To Newgrounds it would get blammed

463
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And make it to the Flash Portal

464
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It belongs on Newgrounds

465
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It was funny, just how bad it was

466
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And then they had the whole like pouting thing

467
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
At the end, oh they didn't buy the game

468
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Because they don't like us or whatever

469
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And I'm just thinking, wow

470
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
This was somebody's fantasy project

471
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I can't even

472
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But there's guys with maid fetishes

473
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That'll have a field day with this

474
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Have fun

475
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I guess this is kind of a

476
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Lights off, pants down kind of game for you guys

477
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Anyhow, other indie games

478
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That are worth much more of your time

479
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
For checking out was the

480
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You have to help me remember the name of this game

481
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It was Cthulhu Saves the World

482
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Which is by the same guys that did Breath of Death

483
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
7

484
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Which I have yet to play

485
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Obviously they love their old school

486
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
RPGs and I mean like Dragon Warrior

487
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
On the NES

488
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Style games or you know like

489
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Original Fantasy Star

490
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So it's kind of like throwing back to the 8-bit days

491
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Cthulhu Saves the World is cute because it definitely

492
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Uses some of that tongue in cheek humor

493
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Where as the

494
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Narrator is talking, Cthulhu's like

495
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I can hear you

496
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's kind of a cute little premise

497
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The game itself

498
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't know, like going back to

499
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Really old games like Dragon Quest and

500
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Fantasy Star, they feel a little more

501
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Grind fest to me now

502
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Than they used to

503
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So I don't know, the game itself, they tried to do some

504
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Neat new things with the battle system for like combo

505
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Encounters and things like that but

506
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh and the other thing I got to say I like

507
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
They had this whole system where the

508
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Most number of random battles

509
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You'll ever get into in a dungeon is 25

510
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But if you want to fight

511
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
More random encounters, you can go to the main

512
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Menu and select fight

513
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And it's kind of like you will purposefully go into another

514
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Random encounter fight, that's a really

515
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Neat kind of system, like somebody really kind of thought

516
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That one out, like how to

517
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Make it, you remember like there'd be certain

518
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Dungeons in Final Fantasy games

519
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That every two steps was like walk walk

520
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Like random battle comes in

521
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Right and it would get really annoying

522
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I thought that was kind of a neat way to

523
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Make sure that it's always going to be a little bit

524
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Consistent and not become too cumbersome

525
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And once you hit your cap, you're done

526
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You can just explore the cave all you want and not worry

527
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
About any more surprises

528
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So yeah, I thought that was

529
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It has some neat ideas, so I like

530
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That it's trying to take that really old 8-bit

531
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Idea and make it better

532
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It still felt a little bit like a Grind fest

533
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
To me, but the humor in the game

534
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Makes it, I think, a little more

535
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Bearable and makes you kind of

536
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Curious what joke they're going to tell next

537
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So, and especially for the price

538
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Because you know, indie games are very reasonably priced

539
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
240 Microsoft points, that's what, 3 bucks?

540
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
As much as you pay for something in the game room

541
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'd say, heck yeah, why not?

542
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Go do it. I was really impressed by

543
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The soundtrack in Cthulhu

544
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Saves the World. It did have a good soundtrack. Amazing soundtrack

545
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And yeah, it was pretty funny when he

546
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
One of the first things you do is you

547
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Rescue sort of a damsel in distress

548
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
On the beach

549
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And you save her and Cthulhu is like

550
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So am I a hero now?

551
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And the narrator's like, you're the Dark Lord of

552
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The Eldritch, like hell no

553
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Saving a girl isn't going to cut it

554
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We need a little bit more from you

555
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And that was kind of funny how it's very sarcastic

556
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And she has a big crush on him

557
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, she falls in love with him with his big tentacle mouth

558
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
She's like, oh you are so fine

559
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Aren't you just waiting for the Uosugdoji scene

560
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
To come happen?

561
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's unpleasant

562
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But I do want to keep playing just to see

563
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
If that happens

564
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Although I think games on the marketplace

565
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Can't be too adult

566
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Although somehow this

567
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Borderline innuendo made game

568
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Gets on the marketplace

569
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I mean granted, there's no titty

570
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The game would have been ten times better

571
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
If there were boobs

572
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
There was one with titty in it

573
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Was that the guy game?

574
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Was that for the PS2?

575
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
On the indie games or whatever

576
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And it was some chick or whatever

577
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Like this guy's girlfriend

578
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
She wasn't like supermodel

579
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It was just

580
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Some normal chick

581
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That they had her in lingerie

582
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And that game got yanked

583
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Really quick though

584
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Unfortunately

585
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Now that we've had maids with balloons

586
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm just waiting for furries

587
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
With guns

588
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I can't wait for there to be the furry porn game

589
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
On Xbox Live

590
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm kind of surprised it hasn't hit yet

591
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And then there could be furries with guns

592
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Versus maids with balloons

593
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Crazy, so there you go

594
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
By the way, I just got a text message

595
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
From Miss Dark Sakura

596
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
She's gonna be here in two hours

597
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't know if she's gonna make it

598
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
She's just barely gonna hit the end of the show

599
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If she gets here

600
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
She can do her cage match

601
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's not even the podcast part

602
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Trying to think of anything else

603
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I want to say there was one other game I had tried

604
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, the cute little arcade game

605
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The Rascals, was that what it was called?

606
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The skulls?

607
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, with the skulls that was kind of like Mr. Driller

608
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It was Mr. Driller meets

609
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You know what it was? The Mario Brothers

610
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Game on Game Boy Color

611
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Did you ever play that?

612
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Where you could link the systems

613
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And race Mario and Luigi to beat the level

614
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
As fast as possible

615
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Did you ever play that?

616
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Okay, well somebody took that idea

617
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And made like a game out of it

618
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Where basically you race

619
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's a little platformer where you're trying to get

620
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
From start to finish as fast as possible

621
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And then there's this whole Mr. Driller element

622
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
With the colored blocks that you dig through

623
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Kind of thrown in as well

624
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So yeah, if you're like a fan of the old school

625
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
8-bit platformer games

626
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Especially Mario Brothers type

627
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's cute

628
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Some weird

629
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Plot devices they use

630
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I didn't get the whole opening

631
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
With the ship and the rats

632
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I get that they're supposed to be the antagonists

633
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But I don't know

634
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I think this game just needed to kind of throw me in

635
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And start playing

636
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I didn't need all the exposition in the beginning

637
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It was a little weird

638
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But the game's cute

639
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's definitely worth checking out the demo if you like

640
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Either old school games or you like platformer games

641
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You can kind of make your decision from there

642
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Because the demo's pretty robust

643
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So you can check that out

644
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's pretty much it though

645
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
For my gaming week otherwise

646
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Not a whole lot else to report on

647
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So I'll just talk housekeeping real quick

648
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
We are still here

649
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Moving towards our 400th show

650
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Set for the first week of February

651
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We're tossing around some ideas internally

652
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Nothing yet

653
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't think it's going to be too big of a deal

654
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
We've had enough self-serving anniversary episodes

655
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Amongst our 9 year run

656
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We plan to do something a little bit special

657
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Actually right now we're talking

658
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Trying to bring back something the listeners

659
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Have been asking for for a very long time

660
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And I'll leave it at that

661
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
We're going to hopefully debut that back on episode 400

662
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And I'll let you all speculate what that is

663
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Otherwise other housekeeping things

664
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Join us on Twitter

665

667

At Orange Lounge Radio

668
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
How about some news

669
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We've got a lot of it tonight

670
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It was surprisingly a busy week

671
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I guess now the holidays have officially

672
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Been out and people are back at work

673
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
We're getting back into some gaming news

674
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
For what's going to happen through the summer of this year

675
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And we start tonight with Loki

676
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Ah yes

677
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And speaking of people being busy

678
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No one's been busier than Sony

679
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And their legal team

680
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
They've been spending the week

681
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Suing hackers

682
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
For hacking the Playstation 3

683
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Two groups of course

684
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That they were going after

685
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Fail Overflow

686
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The hacking group that

687
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
During a recent conference was talking about

688
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
How they've basically

689
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Found all the

690
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Public keys and were able

691
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
To fully open up

692
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The system for

693
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Homebrew and whatnot

694
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And then of course

695
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The famous in the iPhone scene

696
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
GeoHot

697
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Or George Hot

698
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
He was the one that actually pioneered

699
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The jailbreak for the iPhones

700
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And um

701
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You know later on

702
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Went to release the keys

703
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
For the Playstation 3 hacking

704
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Um

705
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And yeah they're not too pleased by it

706
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Of course

707
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
They're saying

708
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
According to the court documents

709
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The hack violates the DMCA

710
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And the already pirated games are being

711
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Packaged and distributed with these

712
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Circumvention devices

713
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Which by the way is not true

714
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And then

715
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Um

716
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Of course George Hot

717
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Made a comment about that

718
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I would expect the company that prides itself on intellectual property

719
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
To be well versed in the provisions

720
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Of the law so I'm disappointed

721
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
In Sony's current action

722
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I have spoken with legal counsel

723
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And I'm comfortable that Sony's action against me

724
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Doesn't have any basis

725
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Well of course it's going to continue on from there

726
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Um

727
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So here's how it kind of played out this week

728
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
GeoHot on his website

729
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Actually put the keys

730
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Out there so people had access

731
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
To them as well as

732
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Various signing tools

733
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And samples of possible ways to

734
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Install and run homebrew

735
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Of course you know

736
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
None of this actually has anything to do with

737
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Pirating games it's just

738
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Installing homebrew and in fact

739
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
There are some limitations to what he's already

740
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Released

741
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
To not allow

742
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Pirating games

743
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
At least yet

744
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Um

745
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Then it's kind of funny

746
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
There's just all sorts of stuff going on

747
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Um

748
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Try to go a little bit more in detail here

749
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So

750
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
There's a few funny things that are kind of going on

751
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
About this whole court case to begin with

752
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
One

753
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Sony decided you know

754
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
To I guess

755
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Get evidence that

756
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Hotz was accepting money

757
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Donations

758
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Basically saying that oh he was charging

759
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
People for these exploits

760
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
They actually sent him a dollar to his

761
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Paypal account Sony did

762
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Which is kind of weird

763
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And of course you know

764
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Hotz's attorney they're saying

765
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Hotz has not produced a manufacturer sold

766
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Nor does he have

767
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Any intent whatsoever to produce manufacturers

768
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Sell any devices that facilitate piracy

769
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And

770
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
They're saying that

771
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Basically it

772
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Dismisses Sony's

773
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Use of piracy case

774
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
For precedent because the case

775
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Involves hardware use to circumvent

776
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
PSC's protection not

777
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Software

778
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That is weird that Sony sent him a dollar

779
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I mean I understand it was probably for the purposes of

780
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Putting together their argument or whatever

781
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Like they had to do it to kind of like

782
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You know

783
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
There's a lot of weird stuff going on

784
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
In more detail where it doesn't even make any sense

785
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Sure okay

786
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Because the whole court case is going down in San Francisco

787
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And you might think

788
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Well that's you know doesn't sound

789
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Too strange but this guy

790
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Actually resides in New Jersey

791
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Totally out of his jurisdiction

792
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Yeah but Sony's in San Francisco

793
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Aren't they?

794
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I understand that but they're taking the case up against him

795
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
They have to do it in his jurisdiction

796
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But their thing is basically

797
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
That he communicated on Twitter

798
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
He communicated over

799
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You know

800
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Using PayPal or something like that

801
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And those two companies reside in Northern California

802
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So therefore

803
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Is this a copyright or trademark

804
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Issue that they're going for?

805
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
No they're going for the fact that he released their public keys

806
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Okay

807
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Because I know anything to do with

808
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
With copyright or trademark

809
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Or whatever is federal

810
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So then you can intentionally file the

811
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Claim out of state to make the person

812
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Drag their ass to the court where you filed it to

813
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Well they basically did that

814
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Kind of

815
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
One of the comments they're saying is

816
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I think it's quite telling that Sony

817
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Who legally is required to provide

818
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Notice to Mr. Hotz before seeking any special

819
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Relief with the court decided to

820
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Email Mr. Hotz a copy of their motion

821
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
At 7pm when a

822
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Hearing was scheduled for the next morning at 9am

823
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
In California while Mr. Hotz doesn't

824
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Even live in California

825
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Sony's seeking various unreasonable reliefs

826
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Seizing Mr. Hotz personal property

827
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And computers

828
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Luckily the courts postpone the hearing

829
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And this is just

830
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They have a bunch of comments from different law firms

831
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Well I'm pretty sure it's just you know the big company

832
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Exercising their big company muscle

833
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
To try and squelch out this guy

834
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Who has very limited resources I'm sure

835
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Even if they don't have a case they're basically saying

836
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Hey buddy you're gonna spend money on a

837
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Plane ticket to drag your ass out here to defend yourself

838
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Well here's what it is

839
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And you have to understand there's more

840
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This is bigger than just

841
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
This a hacker

842
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You know hacking Sony stuff

843
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What this does is sets precedent for

844
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
A few things

845
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
There is similar cases that went on

846
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
When the whole jail breaking

847
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Of the iPhone thing happened

848
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And that actually

849
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Was overturned in courts and now it is

850
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Legal to jail break

851
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Your phone because of that

852
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Court case well this

853
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Interesting comparison I never thought

854
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Of that sorry I just had to get that out there but I didn't

855
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Realize you're right

856
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
What this story is is very similar

857
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
To the whole jail breaking your iPhone

858
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's using your device not the way

859
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
The company intended but not necessarily

860
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's even going beyond that

861
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The whole thing is

862
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Remember when you buy these consoles

863
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
In their end user license agreement

864
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's basically making it seem like

865
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You're leasing this property

866
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That is Sony's and they're

867
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Paying a fee to basically lease it

868
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So literally it's their property but it's in your home

869
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
This would actually set precedent

870
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That this is your console

871
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You can do whatever the fuck you want with it

872
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
If he ends up winning this case

873
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Is what it's going to come down to

874
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I wonder how that would impact the next generation

875
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Of games and the reason why I say that

876
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Is that you know why that's in there is because

877
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Companies take a big loss

878
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
On their consoles

879
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Even when the Playstation 3 came out for

880
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
What was it $700 when it first came out

881
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Sony was still taking a loss on those consoles

882
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Usually the manufacturers put out

883
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The consoles at a loss

884
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Unless you're the Wii

885
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Was the one console that they weren't taking a loss on

886
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But all these other consoles they take a loss

887
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Because they make the money back from the games

888
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
That are sold and all the licensing that comes from that

889
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So if somehow

890
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
If suddenly this thing is unlocked

891
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That you don't have to pay for games anymore

892
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Then this company is consistently

893
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Losing money every time a console is sold

894
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So it's going to be interesting that the courts

895
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Come in and say well

896
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Obviously it is just like the jailbroken iPhones

897
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You can use these consoles for whatever you want

898
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Is that going to drive the price

899
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Way up of the next series of consoles

900
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I don't think they can do that

901
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Well I mean they can do that obviously

902
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But I don't think it would be smart for them to do that regardless

903
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Because a lot of people don't have the know-how

904
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
To do this

905
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Although

906
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
He went on G4

907
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And made a comment about what the whole case was going on

908
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
He doesn't feel that he's

909
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
In the wrong

910
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Obviously and

911
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's basically as simple as right now

912
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
If your console is not to the latest

913
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Firmware all you have to do is

914
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Download a firmware update that's on his website

915
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And you can immediately download

916
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That firmware, update your console

917
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And boom there it is right there

918
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The ability to install Homebrew

919
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And that's on any console that's out there right now

920
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And it's just, it's ridiculous

921
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
A few other things

922
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Real quick

923
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Can I read some comments from chat because obviously

924
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
This is a very un-passionate issue

925
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And some folks in the chat room are kind of lighting up about this

926
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Nick Gertz in our chat room

927
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't recognize that name so welcome if it's your first time

928
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And our chat room says BS once you buy something it's yours

929
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You should be able to do whatever the fuck you want

930
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
With what you own

931
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Read the end user license agreement

932
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You may think that and you may feel that

933
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And I agree it should be the case

934
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But that's not what they're saying

935
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
That's why they're able to patch your

936
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
PlayStation 3 to remove the other operating system

937
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And all that stuff

938
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I definitely agree with Nick

939
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
That's going to be very interesting

940
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And then SSJ100Matt in our chat room says

941
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Can't blame Sony for protecting its properties

942
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I think they sort of have an obligation to

943
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Because of

944
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That agreement that they have with developers

945
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
That there's all these other companies

946
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That if this whole thing ends up going

947
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Against Sony

948
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
They have an interest in that too

949
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Here's the problem though

950
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
This may be Sony's

951
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Big

952
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Weakness in this case

953
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Is that they're saying that this

954
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Enables piracy

955
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It hasn't enabled piracy yet

956
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
This is not something that's

957
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Well that's true but we're talking now

958
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
We're not talking about in the future

959
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
That's stupid

960
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Should Sony have waited and

961
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Tell piracy was a factor?

962
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Here's the other thing too

963
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Geohot has only released

964
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And this is all speculation

965
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
He's only released a portion

966
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Of the key

967
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Basically he has a

968
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
A key for signing these applications

969
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
That you create in homebrew

970
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It's one key though

971
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
There's a key generator though

972
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That they have to generate these keys

973
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That can be used to sign these different applications

974
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But he hasn't released a generator

975
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
He's only released a single key

976
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So in theory Sony could just ban that key

977
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And all the homebrew stuff wouldn't work anymore

978
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But he's smart you see

979
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Because he's hoping this court case

980
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
In favor, if that's the case

981
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Then it'll be legal for him to release that key

982
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And it's over, it's done

983
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
There's nothing they can do

984
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Once that's out there, there is no way to block that

985
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Anymore, they're done

986
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's over

987
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
SalaciousPop you want to say something and then I'll go to more chat comments

988
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Yeah this is really just about

989
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Opening up additional functionality

990
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
On a console that you own

991
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
If it was some type of hack

992
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Where I don't know you could pull games

993
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Down from the Playstation network

994
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Or that was a demo

995
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And unlock it

996
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Completely different thing I'm talking about here

997
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Where you could then play the full version of the game without paying for it

998
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Then yes, that's something that would hurt the developer

999
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But that's completely different

1000
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That's not what we're dealing with here

1001
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It's just opening up the console for

1002
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Homebrew and whatever else

1003
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Now granted everyone doesn't necessarily share

1004
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That same ideal

1005
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
There's people out there that's like

1006
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Okay how can I use this, the pirate stuff

1007
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh yeah

1008
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
This is one hacker they're going after

1009
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
This is not the whole hacking community

1010
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It's one guy

1011
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
He's not going for piracy

1012
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So the fact that they're saying

1013
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
He's releasing tools to

1014
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Enable piracy

1015
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah in the long run maybe

1016
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But you could say

1017
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Well you release the console that enables piracy

1018
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Because eventually

1019
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
There will be piracy on it

1020
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And just think if they would have just kept Linux on the damn system

1021
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Maybe people wouldn't have gone here

1022
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm convinced that most of the hardcore people

1023
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
In the crypto and DRM

1024
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Communities that love breaking that stuff

1025
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Don't even play games

1026
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
They're like this is an awesome thing

1027
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's got awesome DRM on it, I want to break it

1028
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Because that's fun as hell

1029
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's funny they're asking him

1030
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So what's something

1031
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Once this whole PS3 thing is done

1032
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
What's your next thing, what are you going to move on to next

1033
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
What's your next

1034
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Because he stopped doing the iPhone stuff

1035
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Because he got bored with it

1036
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
That's all it was

1037
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And this guy he's like 21 years old

1038
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
21 year old

1039
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And so he got bored with

1040
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Whatever it was and he's like

1041
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Well I hear the PSP2 is coming out

1042
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Let me go to the other comments from chatroom

1043
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Chat.orangelandrater.com

1044
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
DefectiveCandy in our chatroom says

1045
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Can I put end user license agreements on other things in life

1046
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Like the door to my house

1047
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Maybe

1048
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
SpazinatorPC says

1049
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
If I ever mess with my system

1050
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'd be too afraid of bricking it

1051
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Thus losing my video content that I bought

1052
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
That's kind of where I'm at

1053
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
A little bit

1054
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I really don't have a good reason

1055
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
To hack my system

1056
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Me personally

1057
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Because I don't really want to

1058
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Pirate everything

1059
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I don't know

1060
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
There's limits and I think that's a bit much

1061
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Then we won't have games anymore

1062
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
If everybody goes batshit crazy about pirating

1063
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
But you know

1064
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I don't know I'd be afraid

1065
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Of some of this other stuff

1066
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Of just screwing my console

1067
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Especially 360

1068
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I have lots of XPLA games I've bought

1069
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Like over 100

1070
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's pretty disgusting

1071
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Of course I've had my console for 4 or 5 years now

1072
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah I don't want to lose that

1073
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So I'm afraid to do anything that might even

1074
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Get my console banned or lose me access

1075
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
To all that crap you know what I mean

1076
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I haven't been into

1077
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Chipping or modding systems since the PS1

1078
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And the Dreamcast

1079
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
After that era I stopped

1080
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Doesn't mean I'm not still interested in that community

1081
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
But just as far as

1082
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
The consoles have just gotten too expensive

1083
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
For me to open it up

1084
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm not a whiz with a soldering iron

1085
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
As I once was so I'd probably brick the hell out of it

1086
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But yeah

1087
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I find these stories really interesting

1088
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But I haven't been into modding or any of that stuff in a while

1089
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I would say I would support

1090
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Trying to get around region locking

1091
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And that kind of made me think about that

1092
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Ray Iannami says I could have hacked my US 360

1093
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Then I would have had to get a Japanese one

1094
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Or then I wouldn't have had to get a Japanese one

1095
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And that kind of made me think you know yeah

1096
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Getting around region locking I think

1097
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't understand region locking

1098
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I do

1099
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I understand why they do it

1100
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That doesn't mean I support it

1101
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I know it's coming up later in the show

1102
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Let's not forget

1103
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And I know somebody is going to say it if I don't

1104
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
PS3 of course is not region locked

1105
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
That's good though

1106
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Here's what comes down to it

1107
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I think that when you

1108
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Remove functionality like that

1109
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It's not even necessarily removing it because a lot of the consoles in the past

1110
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Did not have, they weren't region free

1111
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But nonetheless

1112
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
If you remove

1113
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Or do not have features like it being

1114
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Region free

1115
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I think if it wasn't region free

1116
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
That'd give more people motivation to try to hack it

1117
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
To make it region free

1118
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Just like we're going to get into another system

1119
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
That's region free

1120
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I really

1121
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You don't want to give them more

1122
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Excuses to try to hack your system

1123
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And in the PS3 actually

1124
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I think that's why it's taken so long

1125
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It's because it had Linux enabled on it

1126
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
From the beginning

1127
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And it was region free

1128
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Why do you need to hack the system?

1129
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Because most people are trying to install homebrew

1130
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Or play stuff from other regions

1131
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So it's all there

1132
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Well they didn't remove the region locking

1133
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
They removed Linux

1134
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And once they removed Linux

1135
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
People took interest in trying to get that back

1136
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Because people don't like things

1137
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That are taken away from them

1138
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I just want to throw it out there

1139
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
If the Wii wasn't region locked

1140
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
We could have totally made President and Cat sell more than 100 copies

1141
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Just saying

1142
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
If you remember that whole debacle from like 2 years ago

1143
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
2 years ago?

1144
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It's about at least a year and a half

1145
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Not 2 years ago

1146
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It was a while

1147
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I found it interesting that dude was on

1148
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Attack of the show and all this stuff

1149
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
He's become this e-list celebrity now

1150
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
He's big in the

1151
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Iphone community

1152
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
He came up with the jailbreak stuff

1153
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That's pretty big

1154
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Alright

1155
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Let me go to some other stories here

1156
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Kind of getting into other

1157
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Legal-ish type of things

1158
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Although I don't think this is going to end up being a lawsuit

1159
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
There was this whole back and forth

1160
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Between Capcom Mobile

1161
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
This week and the folks that made

1162
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Explosion Man

1163
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Twisted Pixel

1164
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And it has to do with the game Maxplosion

1165
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Which came out for the Iphone

1166
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Which of course was released to iTunes

1167
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Very similar to Explosion Man

1168
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Both feature Little Red Demons

1169
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Kind of running around

1170
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
They're even similar names

1171
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Doing similar things

1172
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah

1173
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Capcom Mobile took a little bit of heat this week

1174
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
For doing that

1175
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So much that the Twisted Pixel programmer

1176
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Mike Henry on his Twitter account said

1177
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Quote, Maxplosion gameplay

1178
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Video makes me sad

1179
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If you're going to outright steal a game

1180
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You should at least understand what makes it fun

1181
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Another note to this is that Twisted Pixel

1182
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Had actually once met with Capcom

1183
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
About getting them to distribute

1184
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Explosion Man

1185
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Capcom passed

1186
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So for them to do something like this was especially insulting

1187
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Well Capcom had to put out some fires of their own

1188
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
They of course were

1189
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Sadened by the whole situation

1190
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Let me tell you how sad in this little statement

1191
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Quote, while Twisted Pixel did have

1192
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Discussions with our console game team

1193
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
About publishing Explosion Man on game consoles

1194
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Capcom Mobile is a different division

1195
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Of Capcom with separate offices

1196
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And as such had no prior knowledge

1197
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Of any meetings between the console game team

1198
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And Twisted Pixel

1199
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Maxplosion was developed independently by Capcom Mobile

1200
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Nonetheless we are saddened by this

1201
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Situation and hope to rebuild the trust

1202
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Of our fans and friends

1203
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
In the gaming community

1204
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
We're sorry

1205
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
We're sorry

1206
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I like how it completely dodges the fact

1207
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
That the game is a total

1208
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You know, I don't want to say rip off

1209
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But heavily influenced

1210
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
By Explosion Man

1211
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You know what I mean?

1212
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
That press release totally dodges

1213
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
That part of it

1214
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Well Capcom Mobile, they have different employees

1215
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And they're in a different building

1216
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Than Capcom

1217
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
They wouldn't work with Capcom console people

1218
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
At all, I mean god

1219
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
They wouldn't be working with those teams

1220
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
When they port over their crappy ports of games

1221
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Onto the iPhone or whatever

1222
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Thank you for Dead Rising with four zombies in it

1223
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So you're telling me

1224
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
That these people have no communication

1225
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
That's like the whole Coke Zero

1226
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Coke thing

1227
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I think people are reading

1228
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
A little too much into what Twisted Pixel said

1229
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Believe it or not

1230
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I believe Capcom

1231
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I think a lot of times these big companies

1232
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Especially international companies

1233
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Tend to work in little silos

1234
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And I don't think

1235
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
That the Capcom division said one to another

1236
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Hey, we got presented this little game

1237
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You guys should try it

1238
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I don't think that ever happened

1239
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Here's what I think did happen

1240
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Explosion Man's been out for a good six months now

1241
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I think some people in the mobile division played it

1242
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And said we want to do a game like this on the iPhone

1243
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I honestly don't think

1244
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It was ever one of those

1245
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Don't make it shadier than it already is shady

1246
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You know what I mean?

1247
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But let's face it folks

1248
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I look at this and I go

1249
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
This is news, really

1250
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Games ripping each other off

1251
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
That's been happening forever

1252
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And especially on the iPhone

1253
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Hello Gameloft

1254
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I mean, ironically enough

1255
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Street Fighter 2

1256
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
How many times was that game ripped off?

1257
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It got a lot of shoddy ports done to it

1258
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
This show started

1259
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Then a game came out called In the Groove

1260
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And there was much heated debate

1261
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
About what a ripoff In the Groove was

1262
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Games biting from one another

1263
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Happen all the time

1264
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It happens in movies too, you guys

1265
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
A lot of movies are ripoffs of one another

1266
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It's not that surprising

1267
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's up to the gamers

1268
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
To reject the crap

1269
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And if you think that this is

1270
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
A crappy derivative of Explosion Man

1271
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Don't buy it

1272
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Don't support the ripoff

1273
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Don't buy it

1274
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It's cute, I guess, in some ways

1275
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That Capcom's being called out on this

1276
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But I really don't think Capcom's alone

1277
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
In what they're doing

1278
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I think every game company out there is guilty of doing it at some point

1279
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Name me a company

1280
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm sure there's a ripoff game they've done at some point

1281
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I can't think of any

1282
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Anyway

1283
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm not taking that literally

1284
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm not trying to profess to be this encyclopedia

1285
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But I'm sure most big companies

1286
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
At one point or another

1287
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Have ripped off another game

1288
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Or allowed a game to heavily influence

1289
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
What they're doing

1290
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And yeah, some comments from our chatroom here

1291
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Darktitsia says Great Gianna Sisters

1292
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Well, you know

1293
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That ended up getting pulled from shelves

1294
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So I was a little too close

1295
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And it's coming out in DS in February

1296
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yeah, but it's all different now

1297
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
One of the great things about Great Gianna Sisters

1298
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Actually, if you want to go way back

1299
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Great Gianna Sisters was a game

1300
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
That came out for

1301
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
The Commodore 64

1302
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And it really looked and felt like Mario

1303
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Especially like the first level

1304
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Blue sky

1305
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Bricks on the ground

1306
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Goomba looking monsters

1307
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Bricks that turned into coins

1308
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I mean, damn

1309
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It was really, really just like Mario

1310
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Little power-ups that make you get bigger

1311
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It really was pretty much a Mario Brothers ripoff

1312
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Ironically enough, when you get into later levels

1313
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
There are some kind of different mechanics

1314
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
That do set the game apart a little bit

1315
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
But here's the thing

1316
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
The reason why people remember that game so fondly

1317
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It wasn't necessarily the game itself

1318
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But it had a kick-ass soundtrack

1319
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
If you've ever heard the soundtrack to Great Gianna Sisters

1320
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And a lot of the Commodore 64 music

1321
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
You still hear that influence today

1322
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I mean, Chiptune, bit music

1323
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
All of it is influenced by Commodore 64 stuff

1324
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
All of it

1325
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And so there was such great music

1326
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That came out of that Commodore 64 era

1327
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Great Gianna Sisters I think is fondly remembered

1328
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Because, yeah, it was a ripoff of a game

1329
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It had an awesome soundtrack

1330
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Dark Tetsuya also brings up Casey Munchkin

1331
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Which was an Odyssey game

1332
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
That was a total ripoff of Pac-Man

1333
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Game Guru says

1334
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Capcom even sued for Fighter's History

1335
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But that time they lost

1336
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
It's kind of interesting what games are considered too close

1337
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And what games aren't

1338
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
ActDeft, by the way, in our chatroom

1339
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Says, Loki, I know a guy that works at Gameloft

1340
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
He pretty much has told some friends

1341
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And me that they pretty much ripoff games

1342
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And just make some cosmetic changes

1343
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Gameloft had a Castlevania Symphony of the Night ripoff

1344
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
They were going to release a few years ago

1345
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But they cancelled it

1346
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
But here's the thing, though

1347
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
But, you know

1348
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
To Gameloft's credit

1349
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Some of their games are actually pretty good

1350
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I mean, granted, they're not the most original thing

1351
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
But damn, you know

1352
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
For what it's running on

1353
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It's pretty good

1354
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Problem is, when they go to

1355
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Develop on consoles

1356
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
They don't really learn that, okay

1357
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I can't put out a

1358
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Well, you can put out a Modern Warfare 2

1359
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Clone, but

1360
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
No one's going to give a shit

1361
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Because it's on consoles now

1362
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's not as impressive as making it run on the

1363
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You know, iPhone or whatever

1364
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
But yeah, their boards, I mean, or whatever

1365
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Aren't, they aren't terrible

1366
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I mean, I haven't played all of them

1367
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But

1368
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
They look, compared to like

1369
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Hungry bird clones and stuff like that

1370
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It could be a lot worse

1371
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Funny enough, if Gameloft had put out

1372
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
A version of Splosion Man, do you think it would've

1373
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Necessitated all these stories on Gamelogs

1374
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
This week? Nope

1375
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It was funny, though, because they did have

1376
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
A story, they didn't make our show roll

1377
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
But Gameloft was saying

1378
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
We don't rip games off

1379
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
There's just a limited amount of genres

1380
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
That we can use, so a lot of games

1381
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Look similar

1382
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
No

1383
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm sorry, that is a bunch of shit

1384
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Do you know why this, I think, got

1385
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Traction and is all over the news?

1386
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Because it's Capcom, and they expect better from Capcom

1387
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Exactly, because Capcom, I think

1388
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Has always been seen as, they're one of us

1389
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
They're friends with the community

1390
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
They're letting the people

1391
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Design Mega Man Legends 3, they're the

1392
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Good guys. I'd expect better from Capcom

1393
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
The console

1394
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Game manufacturer

1395
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Capcom Mobile, their stuff

1396
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Is shit. That's true, the Mega Man game

1397
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
On iPhone, shit. Absolute shit

1398
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Dead Rising, terrible

1399
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Devil May Cry

1400
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I haven't actually played it yet

1401
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
But I'm sorry, it probably won't be good

1402
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So

1403
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
No, I don't expect much better from

1404
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Capcom Mobile

1405
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Now Capcom, though, if they actually put out an

1406
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Xbox Live Arcade game of Maxplosion

1407
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Then I'd be a little sad

1408
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Now you're acknowledging that they're separate divisions

1409
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
This is what I'm saying

1410
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Well, it's their words

1411
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I don't think they're talking

1412
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
To each other, to this extent

1413
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I don't think it's some mass conspiracy

1414
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
The steel explosion, man

1415
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It's not anything like that

1416
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It's just

1417
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's supposed to make crappy

1418
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Games in their mobile department

1419
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
What can I say?

1420
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Alright, let's move on

1421
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Who's accusing who of ripping

1422
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Someone off next? And we'll go to another news

1423
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Story from Salacious Pop

1424
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Champions Online

1425
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Which came out in September

1426
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Of 09, some

1427
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Brief 15-16 months ago

1428
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Is going free to play

1429
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I think Lord of the Rings Online

1430
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Was the most recent major MMO to do this

1431
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Champions Online

1432
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Will be going free to play starting

1433
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
January 25th

1434
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
You can download the client and

1435
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Create your superhero or your villain

1436
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And go along your crime fighting way

1437
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
When it gets relaunched

1438
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
On the 25th

1439
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Getting a new title

1440
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Champions Online Free-for-All

1441
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Which sounds like it might be an expansion

1442
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
But that's just what they're rebranding it

1443
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
For the free-to-play model

1444
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
This story is kind of

1445
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Important to me simply because I

1446
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Was a huge

1447
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I was hugely cuckoo bananas over City of Heroes

1448
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Played that for three years

1449
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And the team within Cryptic

1450
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Studios that was working on City of Heroes

1451
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Was spun off to

1452
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Paragon Studios which is now its own thing

1453
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Just for City of Heroes

1454
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Because Cryptic got the Champions Online license

1455
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And it was going to be the first

1456
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
MMO that had

1457
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
PC and Xbox

1458
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
360 support

1459
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Where you could have an account

1460
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That worked on both

1461
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Platforms

1462
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And a month or two before release

1463
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Microsoft pulled the plug

1464
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
On the Xbox Live component

1465
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Of the MMO

1466
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
When they launched they already had

1467
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Potentially 50% of

1468
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Their game base taken away from them

1469
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
It became PC only

1470
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And it floundered, it never really took off

1471
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It kind of flopped actually

1472
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So this isn't surprising to me at all

1473
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I'm surprised that they're actually going free-to-play

1474
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
For me it would seem

1475
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
That now they would be able to bring it

1476
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
To Xbox Live

1477
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Because before they had

1478
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
For some reason the infrastructure with

1479
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
MMOs and stuff and subscriptions

1480
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Couldn't do it

1481
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I'm sorry but I call bullshit on Microsoft

1482
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Final Fantasy XI came out like

1483
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Six months after the Xbox was out

1484
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
They were able to do this shit for years

1485
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Well then why haven't there been any MMOs on the console yet?

1486
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
That's a damn good question

1487
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
One I think Microsoft needs to answer

1488
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Final Fantasy XI did this shit

1489
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It was PC and 360 and

1490
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
PlayStation 2 for fuck's sake

1491
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You know why I don't think there's been any MMOs?

1492
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Because there haven't really been any MMOs on consoles yet

1493
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
But now

1494
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Sony releasing like DC Universe

1495
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And they're going to have the agency some year

1496
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Final Fantasy XIV

1497
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Well eventually Final Fantasy XIV

1498
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But if that stuff takes off

1499
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
They're going to have to compete

1500
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But right now they had the MMO

1501
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Sony didn't have anything

1502
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And so now

1503
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Final Fantasy XI I don't think did too well

1504
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
For them on 360

1505
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Because it had already been out

1506
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
It's hard to just

1507
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
The audience that would have been attracted

1508
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
To Final Fantasy XI already had it

1509
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
On the PlayStation 2 or on the PC

1510
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
There were just very few

1511
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
You know as Salacious Pop says

1512
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Cuckoo Bananas nerds for that game

1513
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Like me and like you Loki

1514
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
That bought it

1515
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Because we had the PC version

1516
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
But sometimes we wanted to play it on our TV

1517
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It did look really good on the TV

1518
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I'm not going to lie

1519
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Like if I was still into playing Final Fantasy XI

1520
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I'd probably be playing it on the 360

1521
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Home where I just live by myself now

1522
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And I could be using my TV as a giant computer

1523
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Like that I would totally be playing Final Fantasy XI

1524
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
On the Xbox 360 if I was still

1525
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Playing that game

1526
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It, it, it

1527
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
You know if that game went free to play

1528
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah I got to admit if Final Fantasy XI

1529
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Went free to play I'd go back

1530
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I'd go back and if all my characters were still there

1531
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I'd be on like that I would download the client

1532
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I'd be on tomorrow I would

1533
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Not going to lie

1534
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
That's scary, that's a scary thought

1535
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
If you did that, bye bye 14

1536
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It doesn't even matter, don't even release it

1537
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Just forget it, just don't even worry about it

1538
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Just finish, keep adding to XI

1539
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
When I tried to play

1540
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
When I tried to play Champions Online last year

1541
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
For like the free, when they

1542
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Because they came out with a free trial

1543
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Really relatively soon after the release

1544
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Because it was a flop

1545
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I was doing the City of Heroes

1546
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Thing playing with the controller and mouse

1547
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Or not controller, with the keyboard and mouse

1548
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Didn't like it, plugged in my

1549
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Xbox 360 controller

1550
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And all of a sudden all of the buttons

1551
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And the configuration for the controller, the integration

1552
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Was amazing, so you knew that

1553
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
When this game came out

1554
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It had full, like it was ready to come out

1555
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
On the Xbox, and even on the PC

1556
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Version you plug in an Xbox controller

1557
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And you can see how much better the game

1558
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Is with an Xbox controller

1559
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
That's kind of how I feel about DC Universe

1560
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Ironically enough these two games somewhat similar

1561
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
In the whole like super hero in the making thing

1562
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I wonder if this happening

1563
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Is somewhat of a response to DC Universe

1564
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Kind of now entering the market

1565
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And you know, it seems like quite a few

1566
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
People are kind of jumping on board

1567
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And having played the beta test of the PC

1568
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Version of DC Universe, man

1569
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It was so much better when I plugged in the controller

1570
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And did it that way

1571
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So you know, you download the client

1572
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And you create your free account, you can play

1573
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It's

1574
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
It's adopting

1575
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Sort of a freemium model

1576
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Where if you want to pay for the additional

1577
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Costume packs, or the weapons

1578
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Or powers

1579
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Or whatever, you can

1580
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Pay a la carte for that

1581
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
However, if you're into the game enough

1582
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
That you're willing to pay a $14.99

1583
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Subscription, which is what it is right now

1584
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
You will automatically get that stuff as soon as

1585
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It's available, you'll have everything

1586
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So they're still offering

1587
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
A subscription based

1588
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Service for people that

1589
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Are into the game enough that they want all the goodies

1590
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Or you can just play it

1591
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
You know, run

1592
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Have it run with your WoW account

1593
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Do the, if you see one particular

1594
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Expansion that you like, pay for it a la carte

1595
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And otherwise it's free

1596
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
So yeah, hopefully

1597
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
This will help the game out, because I really like the

1598
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Superhero genre

1599
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And this game, I feel, never really got

1600
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
A chance to succeed

1601
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Because of what Microsoft did too

1602
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Speaking of the superhero genre

1603
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Do you have any interest in DC Universe Online

1604
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
That it's out?

1605
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
This is gonna sound, I don't know if this is

1606
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Pretentious or what, but just the fact that it's DC

1607
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Like if Marvel came out with an MMO

1608
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I'd feel the same way

1609
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I just don't like the big names, I like the

1610
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Because City of Heroes has a huge

1611
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
RP community in it, because it's so

1612
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Customizable

1613
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And it's not attached to any known

1614
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
License, like DC is

1615
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
But yeah, I'm gonna check this out now, now that it's free to play

1616
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Champions Online, absolutely, I'm gonna get it

1617
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Well you'll have to come back

1618
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And let us know how it is

1619
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yes

1620
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Let's move on

1621
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So it's no surprise

1622
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
That one of the best games

1623
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
To be released for the Kinect

1624
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Has sold 1 million units in the US

1625
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
That would be Dance Central

1626
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And also Kinect Sports

1627
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Both those games breaking the

1628
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
1 million unit mark

1629
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Of course the Kinect hardware

1630
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Has sold 8 million units

1631
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Worldwide

1632
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And also

1633
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It's kind of neat to mention

1634
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And I don't think a lot of people know this yet

1635
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But in case you haven't picked up Dance Central

1636
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Or you're thinking of picking it up

1637
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
You may want to wait a little bit

1638
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Because they're actually going to be doing a new

1639
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Skew that's going to be coming out to the market soon

1640
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
That will give you, I guess, your first piece of

1641
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Download content for free

1642
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
It's going to include a code for

1643
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
240 Microsoft points bundled into the box

1644
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Ooh!

1645
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Like $3 for free

1646
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
That's nice, one free song or whatever

1647
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah, so

1648
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
But yeah, the game is pretty awesome

1649
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I have to actually go back and play it

1650
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Now that I've got the living room

1651
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I need to play more of this but my apartment

1652
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Is too fucking small

1653
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
It's kind of sad

1654
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
But yeah, Dance Central is a fun time

1655
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And it's so funny because

1656
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Last night I was out at the club

1657
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And they were playing actually

1658
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
A couple songs that I recognized from Dance Central

1659
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Like Evacuate the Dance Floor

1660
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So when Evacuate the Dance Floor started playing

1661
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I actually kind of started doing this in my seat

1662
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Evacuate the Dance

1663
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I was doing the whole little dance from

1664
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
The game

1665
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
That's what that was, I just thought you were drunk

1666
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I didn't know, I had no idea

1667
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
No, that was the dance from Dance Central

1668
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And like you and Rice Princess and Xtaphir

1669
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I went out and got drunk with Xtaphir and Rice Princess

1670
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And Salacious Pop last night

1671
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And so you know

1672
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And Grandpa Warcraft for those who listen to Hoard House

1673
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
That went out last night

1674
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
We all went out and you know good times are had

1675
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And when that song came

1676
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And then what's the other song

1677
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

1678
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I hate that song so much

1679
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I was doing the whole fist bumping thing

1680
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I know you want me

1681
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I know I want you

1682
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
If that song was released by

1683
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Triumph the insult comic dog

1684
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Then it would be amazing, but it's not

1685
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
The routine is pretty fun though

1686
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
The thing about Dance Central

1687
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Is that as stinking cheesy as those dances are

1688
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
You kind of start to remember them

1689
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
After you play the game enough times

1690
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And I'm tempted to do it on the dance floor

1691
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
That one's really weird

1692
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's like a lot of jumping around

1693
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Good times

1694
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Something that won't be as easy to dance to

1695
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
And you really really should not reenact

1696
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
In real life at all

1697
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
The kind of

1698
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I guess you could say

1699
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Very hard R rated

1700
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Mortal Kombat

1701
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Episodes that are going to be coming out soon

1702
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Okay you might remember there was this little

1703
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
YouTube clip some time ago

1704
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
That was like a concept video

1705
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
For a Mortal Kombat movie reboot

1706
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And it was like imagine if Mortal Kombat

1707
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
When all saw Anya

1708
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And it was really violent

1709
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And some big names were in this

1710
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Michael Jai White

1711
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Michael Jai White was Jax and TitsOf9

1712
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
What's her name?

1713
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
She was Sonya

1714
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Jerry Ryan was Sonya in this

1715
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And yeah

1716
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Sadly they're not going to make it a movie

1717
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That's not happening but what is going to happen

1718
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
There's going to be some webisodes

1719
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
A 10 part Mortal Kombat webisode series

1720
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I guess this is somewhat to promote

1721
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
The new games that are coming out

1722
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
So I wonder if that will somehow work together

1723
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Michael Jai White is going to come back

1724
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
As Jax

1725
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
However the website Bloody Disgusting

1726
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
That reported on this because that's a website all about

1727
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The gore movies basically

1728
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
They didn't say a whole lot about the storyline

1729
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
So I imagine this is all just a part to kind of like

1730
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Pump up the release of the game

1731
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
But we don't know a whole lot outside of that

1732
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So I guess it's neat

1733
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm not into the uber violence

1734
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
You see like I like Mortal Kombat

1735
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Because it's cartoony violence

1736
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Like cartoony violence is funny to me

1737
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
But I don't like the Saw movies

1738
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Like that just crosses the line

1739
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
To me

1740
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So I don't know how I feel about this whole thing

1741
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Am I a hypocrite?

1742
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So let's just pop

1743
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Am I a hypocrite because I like Mortal Kombat

1744
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
But I don't like Saw

1745
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
A little

1746
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
A little bit I don't know

1747
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I haven't really thought about it too much

1748
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
One of them is cartoony though

1749
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I don't know it's different to me

1750
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
We'll see

1751
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Weiland in our chatroom says that Michael Jai White

1752
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Has said those webisodes would lead into a movie

1753
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Well I'm sure it would be better than the movie

1754
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
That had come out before it

1755
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Spazinator says anyone remember the short lived

1756
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Mortal Kombat TV show back in the 90's

1757
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Yeah

1758
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
That was an intru- I remember that show

1759
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It was on the network here

1760
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
That is now the CW

1761
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
That used to just show all the

1762
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
You know before there was a CW

1763
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Network they would show all the shows

1764
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Yeah no even before that

1765
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Because this show was on I want to say in the early

1766
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
No I guess it was UPN

1767
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It was UPN at the time that's right

1768
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So it's just funny

1769
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Anyhow

1770
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
We'll see what becomes of this Mortal Kombat

1771
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
As we get closer to the game coming out

1772
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
But for now we move on with more news

1773
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Slice pop

1774
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Okay so

1775
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Capcom is coming out with a system

1776
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
For Marvel vs. Capcom 3

1777
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Where if you do the versus online mode

1778
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And you're playing some stranger

1779
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And he dunks on you really bad

1780
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And the only reason why he didn't get a perfect

1781
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
On your ass is because you got in some block damage

1782
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And you say screw this

1783
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And quit

1784
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Well you're going to eventually rally up enough

1785
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Rage quit points or whatever

1786
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
That you're going to be thrown into

1787
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Other random battles with other

1788
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Rage quitters

1789
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
To discourage that type of behavior

1790
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So yeah

1791
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
That is

1792
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Interesting I believe in

1793
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom for the Wii

1794
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
They have a similar system

1795
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
You enter a random battle

1796
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
In the middle of it because you're losing

1797
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Then once you finally get someone

1798
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
That you can win a round on

1799
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Rage quit on you

1800
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And you guys can just all rage quit on each other

1801
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
While the more serious competitors will

1802
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Take their random battles more seriously I guess

1803
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So yeah

1804
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
That story

1805
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Came out last week

1806
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Sounds interesting

1807
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I wish they'd do this in WoW

1808
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I wish they'd do this in Grand Theft Auto

1809
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Does everyone seem to like this idea?

1810
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
What if the rage quitting is beyond your control though?

1811
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
What if it's like a legit connection failure?

1812
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
If you're out in the boonies

1813
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And you only have like maybe satellite

1814
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
As your only broadband option

1815
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Then yeah that might suck for you

1816
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But then again

1817
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
You're still a problem for the people you're trying

1818
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
To play against

1819
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
You're still dropping out all the time

1820
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So maybe you do need to be paired with the rage quitters

1821
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
They don't know that you dropped out

1822
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
They just think you're a rage quitter anyway

1823
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
So it's still your problem

1824
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
With auto matches and stuff

1825
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
But I would think that they would know

1826
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
That I'm not rage quitting because I'm kicking the fucking

1827
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Ass out of them

1828
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And I'm in first place and then I drop

1829
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It's not like, oh dammit I'm doing too good

1830
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I'm leaving

1831
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Okay well we both see myself

1832
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Maybe a little bit

1833
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Just a tad

1834
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Let's travel around the world and look at release dates

1835
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
For games that are coming out soon

1836
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
More games that you can rage quit in

1837
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Yes this week is not too busy

1838
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
But it doesn't fucking matter

1839
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Because there's only really one game you should pick up

1840
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And that would be LittleBigPlanet 2

1841
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Very excited that this game is coming out

1842
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And I can dust off my PS3 finally

1843
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And play this game

1844
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So it's pretty awesome

1845
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
If you haven't played this game yet too

1846
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
On Playstation 3 as well

1847
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Mass Effect 2 will be making its way out

1848
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And it's slightly

1849
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Polished

1850
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Mass Effect 3 engine

1851
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Along with all the download content

1852
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So that's kind of cool

1853
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
That'll be out this week as well

1854
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Some other fun stuff coming out this week

1855
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Plants vs. Zombies on Nintendo DS

1856
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Which is a pretty awesome game

1857
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Mindjack is actually

1858
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Kind of a neat looking game

1859
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
This is on Playstation 3 and 360 from Square Enix

1860
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Getting some comparisons

1861
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
To Demon's Souls actually

1862
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Except for the, I don't think it's supposed to be

1863
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
To the point where you want to

1864
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Blow your brains out hard

1865
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
But

1866
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Apparently it's one of those games that

1867
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Has a persistent online

1868
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Portion of it where you can jump into other

1869
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
People's games and play as the villains

1870
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Nice, I love that idea

1871
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
So yeah

1872
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
That's something that's coming out this week which is pretty cool

1873
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And then

1874
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
What else

1875
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Oh Spellforce 2

1876
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Faith and Destiny I guess is a PC title that's coming out

1877
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
This week as well as Fanatica on PC

1878
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
That was a little bit of a holdover

1879
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
But that's it, really a small week

1880
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I bet you anything there's going to be a Demon's Souls 2

1881
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Announced at E3 this year

1882
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Oh there will be a Demon's Souls 2

1883
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
That game sold incredibly well for them

1884
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I remember though, I actually played that at E3

1885
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Before it came out and there wasn't a whole lot of buzz around it

1886
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
But I remember playing that demo early on

1887
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Thinking it was a pretty neat little game

1888
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
But I didn't know about all these other features

1889
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Until after the game had come out

1890
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It was hard to get that from a demo

1891
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Playing it on the show floor

1892
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I bet you there's another one coming out this year

1893
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It's going to be interesting

1894
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I'd say I'd check it out

1895
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
But unfortunately games cost $60

1896
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
So if I'm not able to rent it first or try it

1897
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I don't know

1898
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Give it some time

1899
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Especially since it's packed in between

1900
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
LittleBigPlanet 2 and

1901
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Dead Space 2

1902
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
A lot of people aren't going to realize that this game is out

1903
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And they'll probably drop the price rather quick

1904
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
We'll see

1905
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Let's move to Japan and look at the Japanese release dates

1906
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
We have Kinect Joyride coming out on the 360

1907
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
As well as Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom

1908
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Both come out on the 20th of this month

1909
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
On 360

1910
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So they're getting some of their Kinect localized titles

1911
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
A little later than we had them here

1912
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
That also comes out by the way on the Playstation 3

1913
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Not Kinect of course, but Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom

1914
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Comes out from Namco Bandai

1915
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
This game

1916
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I'm trying to think if I've heard of this here in the US

1917
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
And I know I've seen a trailer for this

1918
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And it actually looks pretty awesome

1919
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Loki, what is this game called here?

1920
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's from Namco

1921
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And it's like Overworld

1922
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
There's a giant following you

1923
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
It's called Magen and the Forsaken Kingdom

1924
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Is this called the same game here?

1925
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
It came out over the end of November

1926
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
What? I missed this game?

1927
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Yes you did

1928
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
This looks kind of neat

1929
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
How well received was it?

1930
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I don't know

1931
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It dropped in price a bunch of times

1932
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Right before it came out

1933
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I think it was only a $40 game

1934
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I might have to check that out

1935
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
So many games came out at the end of last year

1936
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I forgot about it because

1937
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Was it

1938
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Operation Black

1939
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Black Ops

1940
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Something like that

1941
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Assassin something or other

1942
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Creed, Brotherhood

1943
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Alright also coming out on Playstation 3

1944
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
This is a price reduction of a game that's already been out

1945
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It comes in the best series now

1946
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Ryugago Toku

1947
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
4 Densetsu

1948
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Sugimono

1949
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
You might know this game as Yakuza 4

1950
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Same game there and that's getting a big price reduction

1951
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
On the Playstation 3 this week

1952
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Going to some other systems like the

1953
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Nintendo Wii

1954
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Sengoku Mosuo 3

1955
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Gets a price reduction this week

1956
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Momotaro Densetsu

1957
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
2010 Sengoku Ishin no Hiro

1958
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Das Yugo

1959
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Gets a price

1960
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I think that's a price reduction as well this week

1961
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
So lots and lots of things getting cheaper

1962
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I'm trying to see what this game is

1963
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
This looks kind of like a train station

1964
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
These train games are very popular

1965
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Over there in Japan so it's another train simulator

1966
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Game that is

1967
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Getting a price reduction there

1968
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Starting to see some stuff for the

1969
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
3DS forming in Japan

1970
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Can't talk about it until February 26

1971
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
But that's starting to show up on my list so that's kind of exciting

1972
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
But if you want to go back to the regular DS

1973
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Zombie Daisuke comes out this week

1974
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
As well as yet another price

1975
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Reduction for Gaikuten

1976
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Kenji comes out

1977
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Also Plants vs. Zombies

1978
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I guess comes out in the US this week

1979
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And that is actually getting some

1980
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Import over in Japan believe it or not

1981
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Also a huge huge release

1982
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
On the PSP this week

1983
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep

1984
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Final Mix

1985
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
So it's kind of like the game redone with the extra stuff

1986
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Including anything we got here

1987
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
In the US that they didn't get over there

1988
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
One other game on the PSP dimension

1989
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Venus and Braves

1990
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Majo to Megami to Horiobi

1991
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
no Yugen comes out from Bandai Namco

1992
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
This week as well

1993
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
So there you go

1994
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Venus Braves by the way is

1995
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
What that series is known as

1996
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
That's it for Japanese releases

1997
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
How about the UK?

1998
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Alright for UK releases I'm going to take it back

1999
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
A couple days just to remind everybody

2000
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
In the great old Britain

2001
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
That DC Universe Online

2002
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000

Recoded as well on the DS on the

01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
January 14th

2010
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000

Playstation 3

2020
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
All of next week

2021
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
On the 21st

2022
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
You know what's funny about those releases

2023
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Is that I almost pretty much heard the same stuff

2024
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
When Loki was talking

2025
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And you don't see that a lot

2026
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Usually the UK will get their stuff late

2027
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yeah so that's pretty cool

2028
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
That a lot of this stuff is coming out in tandem

2029
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So if I were living overseas I'd be pretty happy

2030
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Right now to hear that

2031
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Alright well let's move on with a couple more stories

2032
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
And then the classic game of the week

2033
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I know Dark Soccer is not here tonight

2034
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
We're gonna get to the classic game of the week in just a little bit

2035
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But first two more news stories for you guys

2036
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yes unfortunately the Wii

2037
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Always gets shit on when it comes

2038
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
To download content

2039
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And that seems to be what's going on this time

2040
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
The Rock Band Network

2041
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Which is releasing a bunch of indie tracks

2042
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
On the Xbox 360

2043
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
And I believe they were getting a few

2044
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
You know ported over to

2045
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
The PS3 and Wii well that's gonna

2046
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Stop at least on the Wii

2047
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
It says with a smaller install

2048
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Base, limited demand for releases

2049
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
So far and the significant amount of work

2050
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
It takes for our producers and audio team

2051
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
To convert and process

2052
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
These additional tracks

2053
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
We are no longer able to

2054
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Continue submitting Rock Band Network content

2055
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
To the Wii

2056
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
So to summarize

2057
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Or in other words no one's fucking buying

2058
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It so we're gonna stop making it

2059
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
It says regular Wii DLC

2060
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And Rock Band Network releases for the 360

2061
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
And PS3 will continue uninterrupted

2062
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Honestly

2063
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Truthfully I think the Wii owners are lucky

2064
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
To be getting any DLC at all

2065
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Like with how crappy Nintendo's

2066
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Online front end is compared to their competitors

2067
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I am I honestly think

2068
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Harmonix is graceful

2069
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
And generous in the amount of content

2070
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
That they do put out on the Wii

2071
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And like I realize that a lot of people own a Wii

2072
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And a lot of people have this game on the Wii

2073
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
But I think they more than support

2074
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Their game like better than

2075
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Probably any other fucking company

2076
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Does on the Wii

2077
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Well at least on the Wii though you get some Rock Band stuff

2078
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
This week on the 18th

2079
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
You get the main drag

2080
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
How we look on paper

2081
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Wounded Soul RX

2082
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Band of Horses

2083
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
The Great Soul Lake

2084
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Firewind Head of High

2085
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Seton Clausen

2086
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
The Soul Side

2087
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
White Heat

2088
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
OK Go with White Knuckles

2089
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Alright

2090
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Moving on

2091
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
This makes me very happy because I

2092
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Loved all these old school PC

2093
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Games back in the day

2094
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Apparently there's a new web app

2095
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
That allows you to play Sierra

2096
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Online games on your iPad

2097
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
In related news

2098
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I'm gonna go buy an iPad

2099
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Like ASAP

2100
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I wonder if it will work on the iPhone

2101
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
But I don't know it might be a little hard to play on the iPhone

2102
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Alright here's the deal

2103
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
The website

2104
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Is called Sarian.net

2105
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
It's made

2106
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
The Sierra Online adventure games

2107
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
That they have like Space Quest, Kings Quest

2108
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And Leisure Suit Larry

2109
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
You can play them on the iPad

2110
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
All you have to do is go to the website

2111
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
S-A-R-I-E-N.net

2112
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
And do this before they get that season desist letter loaded on them

2113
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
You can go on there and you can play

2114
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
These games on the iPad

2115
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And it looks like the way this works

2116
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Is a lot of the words kind of show up

2117
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
On the bottom of the screen so you can kind of touch them

2118
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
To put the words in and what have you

2119
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Uh yeah

2120
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
That's basically the deal

2121
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Man that's great if I had an iPad

2122
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I'd be checking that out right now

2123
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
In fact I might try it on my iPhone

2124
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
But I'm guessing it doesn't work nearly as well

2125
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Because you don't have quite the same real estate

2126
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So there you go

2127
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I wonder how they're getting away with this

2128
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I guess it's just kind of one of those

2129
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Intel they get the season desist letter

2130
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
They're just gonna do it

2131
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
On the internet everybody has it

2132
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I don't know

2133
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
S-S-A-R-I-E-N.net.net says wait for iPad 2

2134
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
It comes with electric boogaloo

2135
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
That's from our chatroom chat.orangelsageradio.com

2136
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I am gonna actually wait for uh

2137
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
iPad 2

2138
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I do want to wait for that

2139
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Because it'll have the front facing cam

2140
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
And all the other frills and stuff

2141
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Yeah I enjoy whenever we go to the mall

2142
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And we pass the Apple store

2143
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I was like hey Rob go get your iPad

2144
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Just impulse buy it right now

2145
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
These days I'm gonna do it

2146
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
And then you're gonna be like I was kidding

2147
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I ain't really mean for that to happen

2148
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Well you know when the iPad 2 is announced

2149
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
The prices of those iPad 1's are gonna

2150
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Plummet. Like they're gonna go down to

2151
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Two, three hundred dollars

2152
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I have so many friends that work at the Apple

2153
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Mothership down in

2154
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Where is that?

2155
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I don't even know

2156
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Well all your friends work there shouldn't you know?

2157
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Cupertino here

2158
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And whenever the new generation of

2159
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
iPods come out

2160
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Within their internal employee store

2161
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Cause they get mark downs on that

2162
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Dirt cheap I've gotten two iPods that way

2163
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Nice

2164
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Well except you'll want a new one

2165
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
No I want one of the new fancy pants ones

2166
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I don't want that old shit I want the new one

2167
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
So I can do drunken FaceTime cause that's the only reason you use FaceTime

2168
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Is when you're rip-roaring drunk which I didn't do last night

2169
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Oddly enough but anyway

2170
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
FaceTime is best for like drunk

2171
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Dialing it's drunk dialing for a new century

2172
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Is what it is

2173
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
There you go

2174
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And to answer your question

2175
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Yes you can play it on an

2176
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
iPod but

2177
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
It's hard

2178
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Why is it hard?

2179
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
It's small because you have to type in text on the bottom here

2180
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Oh yuck

2181
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
But you can do it you can click around

2182
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Cause it supports the

2183
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000

2184
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Wow that's kinda cool

2185
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Alright question from our chat

2186
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com

2187
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Live here on this Sunday evening

2188
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Dark Tetsuya says Rob you gonna wait for the 3DSI?

2189
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
No I'm getting the 3DS right

2190
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
When it comes out and I bet a lot of you

2191
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Skeptic folks the first time you see the 3DS

2192
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
You're gonna be like holy shit it really is 3D

2193
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Without glasses and you'll probably buy it too

2194
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I'm really not trying to sound

2195
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Like a fanboy like don't get me wrong

2196
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Nintendo pisses me off more than they usually make me happy

2197
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
But the 3DS

2198
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It's a pretty fantastic piece of technology

2199
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Like I'm almost excited to get it for

2200
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
And I know this is gonna sound weird cause I'm

2201
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Not a fan of 3D movies but like

2202
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
The 3D on the DS doesn't really bother me

2203
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I'm excited to see what kind of 3D movies

2204
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Come out on the DS

2205
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
If Tron Legacy comes out in 3D

2206
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
On the DS on the 3DS

2207
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Like I'm there

2208
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Hello

2209
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Seriously don't you want that?

2210
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
So

2211
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Hell yes I want that

2212
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Alright let's get to the classic

2213
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Game of the week here at Orange Lounge Radio

2214
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
We do a segment every week called the classic

2215
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Game of the week and it has a little theme

2216
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Song

2217
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
And this is the part of the week where DarkSakura

2218
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Dives into her vault and she drags out

2219
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
A classic video game and she says hey

2220
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
You ungrateful brats this is a game

2221
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
That you should be playing this week but guess what?

2222
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
She ain't here so we've hijacked

2223
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
The classic game of the week segment this week

2224
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And we're allowing her fill in tonight

2225
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
SalaciousPop to choose a

2226
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Classic game of the week that he thinks

2227
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
You guys should be playing because you know

2228
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
DarkSakura love her to bits

2229
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And she does pick a lot of Sega stuff

2230
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So we thought maybe SalaciousPop could pick something

2231
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
That DarkSakura maybe would not pick

2232
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I made sure that I'm not

2233
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Stepping on DarkSakura's toes on the whole

2234
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Console classic

2235
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
So I picked a PC classic

2236
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Namely King's Quest 4

2237
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
The Perils of Rosella

2238
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
How appropriate considering the last story

2239
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Off of the Sierra Online story we just finished up

2240
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Wonderful choice

2241
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Let's see if we can get some music here

2242
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
A single tear rolling down my face right now

2243
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
At the title screen music

2244
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
This is the fourth

2245
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
In the series obviously

2246
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Came out August 16th

2247
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
1988 for MS-DOS

2248
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Amiga

2249
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Apple 2GS

2250
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
And Atari ST

2251
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
PC platforms

2252
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I remember playing this game

2253
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
With my friend in junior high

2254
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Across I think 9

2255
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
5 and a quarter inch floppies

2256
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And you could install it to your hard drive

2257
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And hard drives back then were like 40 megabytes

2258
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
If you were lucky

2259
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Or you could move

2260
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
To the next screen and it'll say

2261
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Insert disk 6

2262
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Insert disk 7

2263
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
So it was a game like that

2264
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I loved this game

2265
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Because it was the last

2266
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
In the King's Quest series

2267
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
That used the traditional text based

2268
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Input system

2269
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Like look under bridge

2270
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Search room all that stuff

2271
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
King's Quest 5

2272
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Adopted the new mouse cursor

2273
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Engine

2274
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
So King's Quest 4 the last

2275
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Traditional text based King's Quest game

2276
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Takes place immediately

2277
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
After the events of

2278
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
King's Quest 3

2279
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
You play Rosella

2280
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
The daughter of King Graham

2281
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Of Daventry

2282
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
King Graham in the opening sequence has a heart attack

2283
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
The magic mirror tells you

2284
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
You need to be ported away to

2285
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
A magical world

2286
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
To Tamir

2287
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
To find this fruit

2288
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
And if King Graham can eat the fruit he will not die

2289
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And this game had an internal timer

2290
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
You had to get the fruit and make it back

2291
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
To King Graham within a certain amount of game time

2292
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Or else he would die and it would be game over

2293
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
So you had to figure out the puzzles relatively quickly

2294
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
At some point

2295
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
It turned to night

2296
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And everything got dark

2297
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
There were certain puzzles that you could only

2298
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Like there was an abandoned mansion

2299
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
There was nothing to do there

2300
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Unless you went there at night when it was haunted

2301
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Because the puzzles didn't light up

2302
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Until it was dark

2303
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
So you had to

2304
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Do everything else and then

2305
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
That was the last place you went to

2306
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
While it was still nightfall

2307
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
It had multiple endings

2308
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
It was possible to

2309
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Survive the

2310
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Dangers of Tamir and escape the

2311
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Evil witch Lalote

2312
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
And make it back

2313
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
To King Graham without actually getting

2314
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
The fruit

2315
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
So you had to be

2316
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Able to figure out where it was

2317
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
What items you needed to

2318
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Get the item and then

2319
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
You know, survive the evil

2320
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
The antagonist, the evil witch

2321
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
And then give him the food in the end

2322
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
So it had multiple endings which was pretty

2323
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Innovative at the time

2324
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I think EGA graphics

2325
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
But the pixels were a lot smaller

2326
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Than the traditional King's Quest games

2327
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
So visually even for EGA graphics

2328
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
16 color

2329
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Stunning, and the music of course

2330
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
With the King's Quest 4 I believe

2331
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Was one of the first Sierra games that actually

2332
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Used sound cards

2333
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Instead of just the beep beep beep beep

2334
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Good old ad lib

2335
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I had an ad lib back in the day

2336
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
King's Quests, I want to say 1 through 3

2337
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Or maybe 1 and 2

2338
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Just use your internal speaker

2339
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
The loud harsh beeps

2340
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Sound card support

2341
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
So amazing game

2342
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Also like most

2343
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Of the King's Quest games it was possible

2344
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
To miss an item that you needed

2345
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
To not die or to

2346
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Kill the big bad at the end

2347
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
If you missed that puzzle

2348
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
If you let Cupid fly away from the little pool

2349
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Without getting his cupid's bow and arrow

2350
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
And you saved your game, you were screwed

2351
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Couldn't beat it, sorry try again

2352
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
So yeah

2353
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Great game

2354
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
So many people think so fondly

2355
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Of 4 specifically, like you asked

2356
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Most people what's your favorite King's Quest game

2357
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And most people, including myself, would say

2358
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
4 was the best, period

2359
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Out of a what, 8 game series

2360
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Most people would say 4 is the best

2361
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I rejected the reality

2362
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And where it ate is real

2363
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
7

2364
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Fine, some might argue 9

2365
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
If you count this fan silver lining at this point

2366
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
But why is it, regardless of how many

2367
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
You think there are

2368
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Why is it that 4 is the one that's so fond

2369
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And meet people's hearts

2370
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I mean, again, I'm sure there's people listening to this show going

2371
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
No, 5 was my favorite, or you know, 1 was the best

2372
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Why 4? So many people that I know at least

2373
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Um

2374
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Visually, at the time, people just

2375
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Never saw a game that was that beautiful

2376
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
On PC gaming

2377
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
It really took EGA graphics

2378
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
As far as they literally could go

2379
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Without stepping up to VGA 256 colors

2380
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Um, so just visually

2381
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
People just remember how awestruck they were

2382
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
When they saw it

2383
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And they loaded up the game

2384
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
When you first arrive on that beach

2385
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And you can see the wave of the ocean

2386
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Up against, you know, the yellow sand

2387
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
The sound card support

2388
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
To actually have ad-lib music coming at you through your speakers

2389
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Um

2390
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
And I think the nostalgia of

2391
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Text-based RPGs

2392
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Cause it was the last one in that series

2393
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
King's Quest V and VI were all mouse-based

2394
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I think for me, a big part of it too was in the story

2395
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It seemed like a lot of it was inspired by

2396
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Fables, Aesop's Fables, like Hansel's and Gretel's

2397
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Type of thing, I think that is very

2398
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Fond as well for me, I think that's why

2399
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I grabbed it for IV

2400
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
King's Quest has always had that a little bit, but yes

2401
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
There were a lot of great

2402
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Meta genre references

2403
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Particularly in IV

2404
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Um, the three hags that represent

2405
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
The three fates that all share one eye

2406
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
And you had to catch their eyes

2407
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
So they were blind, otherwise they were gonna eat you

2408
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
That was in King's Quest IV

2409
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Um, you find a

2410
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Gold ball and you throw it into a pond

2411
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And you have to kiss the frog, like the

2412
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Princess and the frog, that's in King's Quest IV

2413
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
So a lot of, yeah, classic fairy tale

2414
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Um, homages are in

2415
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
In this particular title

2416
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Man, I really wish this series would come back

2417
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
And yes, I understand there's the fan project

2418
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And I mean no disrespect, they're doing a

2419
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Wonderful, wonderful thing, and they've

2420
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Taken so much shit for what is really

2421
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Like, a thing that they love, and you know

2422
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
So I'm definitely not slamming that at all

2423
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
But I really wish somebody would just

2424
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Give people lots of money

2425
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
To make a big budget return

2426
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Of King's Quest, you know what I mean?

2427
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
How awesome would that be?

2428
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Well, there have been fan service, um

2429
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
VGA or SVGA remakes of the first three

2430
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Sure, sure

2431
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
That are completely independent and they run great

2432
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
But I mean, just like now with today's technology

2433
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
And games and so forth with, you know, like

2434
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
The DVD and Blu-ray technology and stuff

2435
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Like, I would just love to see, like, a really

2436
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Well done new King's Quest game

2437
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
That's just, you know, like

2438
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I don't know, I don't even know how to explain it

2439
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Like, just that whole kind of world

2440
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I want to go back to that, you know

2441
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Yeah, yeah

2442
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I don't know, and again, I realize Silver Lining

2443
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Can kind of take me there, but Silver Lining

2444
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Is also very much in that same vein

2445
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Of what we remember, but I'd like to see

2446
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Someone kind of like take King's Quest, that series

2447
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And bring it to today's technology

2448
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Big budget type of game

2449
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
The closest thing I think we got was the longest

2450
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Journey and the longest journey 2

2451
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Completely different franchise and story

2452
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And company, but when that game, cause

2453
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
There was a point in the

2454
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
There was, I think, a sort of a

2455
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
A shift in what people wanted

2456
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
On PC gaming, I think around

2457
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Maybe the early, mid 90's

2458
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Where adventure games were boring

2459
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
People didn't like them anymore

2460
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Cause Doom came in

2461
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And PC became about first person shooters

2462
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And then Half-Life and all that

2463
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
And the Sierra style of games, Space Quest

2464
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
King's Quest, were sort of left in the wake

2465
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
You would think though, with all the nostalgia

2466
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Wank that happens out there in the world

2467
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Though that there would be room for this

2468
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And I realize that's kind of where Telltale

2469
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Kind of has their market right now

2470
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And they do a very good job at what they do

2471
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
But I'm just surprised

2472
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Especially when that whole silver lining stuff

2473
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Was going on, that uh, who owns a license now?

2474
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Activision I guess, who got it from Vivendi

2475
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Has basically said, you know what

2476
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
We don't want to revisit that world

2477
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
And that's not just King's Quest

2478
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
That's Space Quest, that's uh

2479
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Police Quest, Quest for Glory

2480
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Quest for Glory, all that stuff

2481
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
And it's just, I don't know, it's just kind of annoying

2482
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Cause I would really like to see some of that come back

2483
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
This is gonna sound a little elitist

2484
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
And maybe I'm a bit proud

2485
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
That this is elitist

2486
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
These games, probably too hard

2487
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
For kids these days

2488
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
They were hard, you could save your game and just

2489
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Screw up, you had to start all the way over

2490
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
That stuff doesn't fly now

2491
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And for it to be a true King's Quest

2492
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Or Space Quest game, it would need to be hard

2493
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
As hell, you would need to be able to

2494
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
You know?

2495
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
You didn't fail, sorry

2496
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
You didn't throw the boot at the cat

2497
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
So now the mouse isn't gonna rescue you

2498
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
In King's Quest V, so lol, 15 hours of your life

2499
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
You have to do over

2500
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
That won't fly anymore

2501
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
That's true

2502
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Everybody wants the easy button now

2503
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Alright, well if you want to go

2504
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
See how we had it when we were young

2505
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
You ungrateful kids, go check out

2506
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
King's Quest IV, The Perils of Rosella

2507
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Because it was just one of the best

2508
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
King's Quest games they ever did

2509
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I believe this was ported to a variety of consoles

2510
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
It's not just PC

2511
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I mean, clearly the PC is the best one

2512
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
But if you must, I believe it was on the NES

2513
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Wasn't it?

2514
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
V was, V was ported

2515
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I thought IV was on the NES too

2516
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Yeah, V was the one

2517
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Also, you can get the King's Quest collection

2518
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And Space Quest collection on Steam

2519
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
It comes with DOSBox

2520
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Which is that sort of indie MS-DOS

2521
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Emulator that's fully inclusive of all that

2522
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Stuff that will run on Windows 7

2523
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
That includes, of course

2524
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
This game, King's Quest IV

2525
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
For about 20 bucks on Steam

2526
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
For whatever reason, it's never

2527
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
On sale, so I think the licensing

2528
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
For it is very bare bones

2529
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Where Activision is like, here's this

2530
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
DOSBox emulated

2531
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Comp of these old ass games

2532
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And we're not letting you put it on sale

2533
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Ever

2534
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Steam never really

2535
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Features it on the RPG page

2536
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
You have to literally search for it in the Steam client

2537
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
King's Quest collection

2538
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
But you can get it, yeah

2539
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
If anybody's still using GameTap, I think a lot of those games

2540
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Are on there too

2541
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Good old games, GOG might have some of these too

2542
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Yeah, absolutely

2543
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says, Westwood also put out

2544
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
The Chirandia series of adventure games

2545
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Just reminded me of another great series

2546
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
That was one Loki really liked too, if I remember right

2547
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Yes, I did

2548
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Specifically Chirandia, The Hands of Fate

2549
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Alright, well that's gonna do it for our

2550
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Classic game of the week

2551
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Very good pick, Alan, very well done

2552
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I'm sure DarkSakura would be proud

2553
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
We'll ask her when she gets back

2554
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
But we are gonna take a quick break, but don't worry

2555
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
There's plenty more OLR to come

2556
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
We're gonna get to some rapid fire news

2557
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Twitter topics of course, if you haven't submitted

2558
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Your tweets tonight, you should get those in at

2559
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Twitter.com slash OLR

2560
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
We've got a lot of stuff about the 3DS

2561
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
We haven't even got to yet

2562
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
And some other stuff on the PSP too

2563
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
But not just that, because we'll talk about that

2564
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Dreamcast collection, and if

2565
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Everything goes bad in Part B, don't worry

2566
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Mama will fix it. This is right, another

2567
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Cookie Mama story coming up in Part B

2568
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
So we'll be right back you guys with a little more of

2569
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Orange Lounge Radio, don't go anywhere

2570
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge

2571
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Radio, we are live with the

2572
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
397th episode of our

2573
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Show on this January the 16th

2574
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
of 2011

2575
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Dark Sakura, she is out right now

2576
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
She's on her way back, she's been at some

2577
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Type of pinball event all day, I'm hoping

2578
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
She makes it back before the end of the show

2579
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
So we can ask her about that a little bit, but joining

2580
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Us here in studio tonight filling in is Salacious Pop

2581
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Who's been on a few episodes of OLR

2582
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
So he's doing a great job co-hosting

2583
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Tonight. Pat on the back for you and Cookie

2584
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Thank you. You're welcome. And of course

2585
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Loki here with us as always as we

2586
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Tackle some of the news, and we're gonna let Loki tackle

2587
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Some of the quick news here in just a minute

2588
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
But first, I wanna make sure that I do

2589
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Give some plugs

2590
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Towards the spinoff shows

2591
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
If you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, we're

2592
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Starting this whole little mini

2593
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Family of shows I guess you could

2594
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Say, do listen to Comic

2595
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Insanity, it's Dark Sakura's side

2596
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Podcast, she has all about comics and the latest

2597
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
And greatest going on there

2598
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
She does that at

2599
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
The infamous.net

2600
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Is where you can find that or you can search for it on

2601
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
iTunes, Comic Insanity

2602
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
It's the letter N, there's no I

2603
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
In front of that. Also if you like World

2604
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Of Warcraft, you might wanna check out my show

2605
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Horde House, that tapes every Thursday

2606
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
There might be a live episode

2607
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
This week, we are working on that

2608
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I'm gonna try and hammer out the

2609
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Details, I don't know exactly

2610
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
How that's gonna work cause I gotta make sure if

2611
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
It's gonna be at all games we have to respect

2612
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
There are other shows that already have time slots

2613
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
So we're gonna try to make that happen

2614
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
This week

2615
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
One off thing, we're not always live though, and if you like

2616
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
That, Xtafer is my co-host

2617
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
There and he's pretty hilarious and

2618
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
We talk a lot about World of Warcraft and all that good stuff

2619
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
So check that out, we don't really have

2620
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
A website for that yet, but you can find us on

2621
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
iTunes at Horde House, or if you go to

2622
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
OrangeLaundry.com, the main site for

2623
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Our show, there are little buttons that link you to

2624
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Our side projects right there, it's great

2625
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
So check it out

2626
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Alright, let's move on to some quick news

2627
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
And we'll get to Twitter topics

2628
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
In just a minute, so last call for some Twitter topics

2629
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
At Twitter.com slash

2630
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
O-L-R while we do some rapid fire news

2631
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
As part of that

2632
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Whole Mega Man

2633
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Legends 3 meta thing that they have going on

2634
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Where basically the fans

2635
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Decide

2636
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
You know

2637
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Different aspects of Mega Man

2638
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Well it came down to voice actresses

2639
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Or actors

2640
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
For the Mega Man role

2641
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And it was up to the vote

2642
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Of fans and 3000 people voted

2643
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
And it looks like

2644
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
That your Mega Man voice

2645
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Actress is going to be

2646
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Akimi Kondra

2647
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And I guess

2648
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
She was the voice actress

2649
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
That did work in

2650
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Mega Man X command mission

2651
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And powered up, and I guess she's also

2652
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Done work in Persona 4, Fatal Frame 2

2653
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
And Clonad

2654
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
That's pretty cool

2655
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
And I guess Mega Man Legends 3

2656
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Is headed to the 3DS

2657
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Another reason to own a 3DS

2658
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Fucking Mega Man

2659
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Legends

2660
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
The Dreamcast collection

2661
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Something that's been rumored for a while

2662
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Is actually coming out on PC

2663
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
And Xbox 360

2664
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
This February

2665
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
I gotta admit though it's not too exciting

2666
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
It's really just a collection of

2667
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
The titles that are coming out on Xbox Live

2668
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Arcade

2669
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Crazy Taxi, Sonic Adventure

2670
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Sega Bass Fishing, and Space Channel 5

2671
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Part 2

2672
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
To enhance up res graphics

2673
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Apparently it's going to retail for $30

2674
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And it'll be out on

2675
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
February 22nd

2676
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Is that something that you'd be interested in

2677
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Rob, since you know it does have Space Channel 5

2678
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Of course, I hella want

2679
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Space Channel 5

2680
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I wouldn't buy the collection, I'd just buy

2681
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Space Channel 5 when it comes out on

2682
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Xbox Live Arcade

2683
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
That's what made my ears perk up

2684
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Because

2685
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Sonic Adventure, I heard that port wasn't

2686
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Very good, Crazy Taxi's missing a lot of the

2687
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
License stuff, Sonic Adventure just wasn't very good

2688
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
So, you can port it all you want

2689
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
It's Sega Bass Fishing, I just

2690
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Don't give a shit about that, so you know

2691
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Um

2692
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And this is a

2693
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Juicy rumor here, apparently

2694
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
You know, the uh

2695
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Well actually

2696
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I'm jumping ahead here, you are a little bit

2697
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Sorry, must have missed the link

2698
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
There, no, this is actually a juicy

2699
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Rumor, it's actually coming in the form of

2700
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Slurpees

2701
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
They're going to be doing some sort of promotion

2702
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Now with LittleBigPlanet 2 and Killzone 3

2703
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Where you can go buy Slurpees

2704
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And at your local

2705
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
7-Eleven

2706
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And you'll be able to get different

2707
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I guess

2708
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Prizes

2709
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Or codes that you can

2710
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Redeem for things, they're going to have

2711
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Strategy guides, premium themes

2712
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Download content, and more

2713
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
No word if they're

2714
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Going to actually have any sort of special

2715
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Flavors to go along with them

2716
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
I almost wanted to stop at

2717
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
7-Eleven on the way here, because it's like

2718
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Ooh, Slurpee

2719
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
That's good stuff

2720
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Alright, Slurpees are amazing

2721
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
But lots of calories

2722
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
So for those of you that are trying to do

2723
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Diets for the new year, I'd stay

2724
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Away from Slurpees, just saying

2725
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
But they're really good

2726
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I love the Pina Colada ones

2727
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Yeah, I was just about to bring that up

2728
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
So gross

2729
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
He'll get the large Slurpee of the flavor

2730
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I think Coconut is vile

2731
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
So he will get the Pina Colada to guarantee

2732
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
That I won't try to, you know, Bogart it from him

2733
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I love Coconut, like I love McCroons

2734
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Are like my favorite cookie ever

2735
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And then Coconut Cream Pie is so amazing

2736
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Oh my gosh

2737
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Coconut's very high in fat though, just saying

2738
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
If I cook something awesome, then I just have to put

2739
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
That'll guarantee that it's mine

2740
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
And Rob won't try to eat it

2741
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I hate mayonnaise

2742
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Even today, we were at Panera Bread, Loki's favorite restaurant

2743
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
We decided to go to Panera Bread for the show

2744
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
It's not my favorite restaurant

2745
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Right here at OLR it is

2746
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
What have I been eating the last two weeks?

2747
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
French onion soup

2748
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
No, I have not been eating French onion soup

2749
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I have been having

2750
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Was it a ten piece

2751
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
The Honey Hot BBQ Wings

2752
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
From KFC

2753
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
With a giant root beer

2754
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Without ice, because I do not want my

2755
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Root beer watered down by crappy ice

2756
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
How dare they

2757
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
How dare they steal some of my

2758
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Precious root beer room with ice

2759
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I don't know what it is

2760
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
But A&W from an A&W

2761
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Or even the combination KFC A&W

2762
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Like they have out here is so much better

2763
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Than the ones at the store, I can't explain it

2764
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
A&W from the tap is so much better

2765
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
They sell them in gallon jugs

2766
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I swear to god

2767
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I can drink a half gallon

2768
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I can do it

2769
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I've seen them

2770
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
They are seriously

2771
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
It's a sight to behold

2772
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I tell you man

2773
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I took Salacious Pop to Panera for the first time today

2774
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
He really liked it

2775
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I guess they don't have them in his neck of the woods

2776
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Kind of a new thing

2777
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
People on Facebook have said there is a bunch around me

2778
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
But in the neighborhood I'm in there aren't any

2779
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I've never seen one

2780
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
What's ironic is

2781
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
It took the place of a Krispy Kreme

2782
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
It's kind of one extreme to the other

2783
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I know and that is crime right there

2784
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Really they should have just

2785
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
They should have tore down another restaurant

2786
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Get rid of the Wendy's

2787
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Wendy's sucks and everything

2788
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Alright let's get back to gaming news

2789
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Yet again the food topic

2790
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I don't even know what to say

2791
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
We have a release date for PlayStation Move Heroes

2792
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
It's March 22nd

2793
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Some bonuses that come with the reservations

2794
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Depending on where you reserve it

2795
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Amazon and Gamestop

2796
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
You can get a skin pack with Pirate Sly

2797
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Freedom League Jack and

2798
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Trillium Armor Ratchet

2799
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Is all the special stuff you can get there

2800
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Apparently quote

2801
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
There's also a full story surrounding the game

2802
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
And why they're all together

2803
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
That is from Christian Cardona

2804
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
The marketing manager of the game

2805
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
PlayStation Move Heroes

2806
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I have yet to buy a PlayStation Move

2807
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Super Street Fighter 4 3D

2808
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Is coming out of course on the 3DS

2809
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Online multiplayer

2810
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
That's pretty neat

2811
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
There was a whole little trailer too that hit the internet this week

2812
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
That was showing some of the features like that

2813
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
But there's also going to be worldwide online play

2814
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
And what's called channel live

2815
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
You can just watch live matches

2816
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And channel live if you want to watch the pros do their thing

2817
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
There's also figurine collecting

2818
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
And random street fighting modes

2819
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
If you want to do that

2820
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
That's that whole using the aware thing

2821
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
As you walk by people

2822
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
I guess your character can fight somebody else

2823
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
That's going to be a pretty big launch title

2824
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Even though most of us have already played Super Street Fighter 4

2825
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
My question is

2826
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
And maybe this has already been answered somewhere

2827
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
I just haven't seen it

2828
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
How has the character roster been affected by the move to the 3DS

2829
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I mean surely they had to cut some characters out right

2830
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Or did they not

2831
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Wow that's pretty amazing

2832
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
The videos and the YouTubes that have been out of this game

2833
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Have blown my mind on how good it looks

2834
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
So if for it to look that good

2835
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
If they cut a few characters

2836
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
In order for that to happen I do not mind

2837
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
There's some awesome stuff coming out on that game right now

2838
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Yeah I'm trying to see if there's a 3DS thing

2839
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Let's see

2840
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
It's coming out, it has Wi-Fi

2841
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
It has all 35 console characters plus

2842
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Yeah all of them are going to be on the 3DS release

2843
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
It's been called exactly the same as its HD counterparts by Capcom

2844
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
That's pretty amazing

2845
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
You can set up four hotkeys

2846
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
For moves and combos on the touch screen

2847
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
That's kind of interesting

2848
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Can I go on the tangent train a little bit?

2849
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Of course

2850
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I really hope that this generation of handhelds

2851
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Be it the 3DS or the PSP2

2852
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Uses more of the infrastructure central server style of multiplayer

2853
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Because the last few generations

2854
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Obviously you've got the Game Boy Advance with the link up cable

2855
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
That was the last generation that used that

2856
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
With the PSP and the DS

2857
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
It's all ad hoc

2858
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I don't know that many people that have a PSP

2859
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Where I can be in the same room with them

2860
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
And do ad hoc connect

2861
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
So I really want this generation

2862
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Super Street Fighter 4 3DS

2863
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
To have the central server

2864
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And I know with the PS3 and the PSP

2865
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
You can do the tethering

2866
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
But that's still just too cumbersome for me

2867
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It's too much of a pain in the ass I agree

2868
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
So I love handhelds

2869
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
But I'll never play ad hoc support

2870
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Because I don't know that many friends with them

2871
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
So that's all

2872
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Let's talk about another fighting game on the 3DS

2873
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Dead or Alive Dimensions

2874
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
It's kind of interesting because they've talked about

2875
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
This game is going to have 30 frames a second and 60 frames a second

2876
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
It just depends on if you're playing 3D or 2D

2877
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
So if you're playing in 3D mode

2878
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
You only get 30 frames a second per eye

2879
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
But if you decide to condense it down to 2D

2880
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
You'll get a 60 frames a second fighter

2881
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
That's kind of interesting

2882
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I mean it makes sense too

2883
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Because obviously 3D is rendering one frame

2884
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
And then another really fast back and forth

2885
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
In rapid succession

2886
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
They look pretty good in 3D

2887
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
But that's pretty cool that if you get sick of 3D

2888
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
There's kind of like a little perk if you will

2889
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
To play in 2D

2890
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Kind of neat

2891
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I'm sure a lot of games are like that by the way

2892
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Yeah same with Street Fighter IV on there

2893
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Because they have that really funky view that you can do

2894
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
That gives it more depth

2895
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
But if you don't want to do that

2896
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
You don't have to do that

2897
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Salacious Pop has a few stories for us

2898
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Then we're going to get to the Twitter topics

2899
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Real quick though

2900
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
It seems to be kind of smart in Nintendo's part

2901
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
At least, well I don't know if it's Nintendo's part

2902
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
But as far as like

2903
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
The games that are coming out launched

2904
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
You know for it and stuff

2905
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
It seems to be kind of quite a variety

2906
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
It's not all like, oh it's Mario this

2907
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Or you know Zelda this

2908
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
And all kitty stuff

2909
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
It's like we've got some hardcore fighters in there

2910
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
We've got a little bit of

2911
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
You know the Nintendogs kind of crap

2912
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
And a little bit of

2913
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Something for everybody

2914
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I think that's pretty awesome

2915
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Indeed, it sounds like it's going to have

2916
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
A pretty good lineup at the beginning

2917
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I hope the price is reasonable

2918
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
We'll see pretty soon though

2919
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Alright Salacious Pop

2920
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Okay

2921
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
For my quick fire stories

2922
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Those of you who wanted to play

2923
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Pac-Man Battle Royale

2924
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
The Return to Form

2925
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Pac-Man arcade game multiplayer

2926
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
That is now available to

2927
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
American arcade distributors

2928
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
So that means that whatever arcade

2929
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
If you're fortunate enough to live in an area

2930
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
That still has one

2931
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
They can have it

2932
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
It's a cocktail style cabinet

2933
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
You know the old pizza parlor

2934
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Model to set your drink on it

2935
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
So it's the flat glass

2936
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Coming soon to Dave and Busters everywhere I'm sure

2937
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Yeah

2938
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
According to the source of the article

2939
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Arcade Heroes

2940
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
It's currently being sold

2941
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
For $4,275

2942
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
To the arcade businesses

2943
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
That might want to get it and put it in the store

2944
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Or in their arcade

2945
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Which apparently is cheaper

2946
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Than most of the other stuff

2947
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Most arcade games right now that are popular

2948
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Are the ticket spitters

2949
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
And the big time crisis

2950
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
The huge shoot-em-up

2951
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Arcade games

2952
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
So the Pac-Man

2953
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Battle Royale cocktail cabinet

2954
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
A little over $4,000 I guess

2955
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
For a new arcade machine

2956
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
So yeah

2957
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Pac-Man fans look for that in your arcade

2958
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Starting hopefully as soon as this month

2959
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Because it's out there for us to buy it

2960
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
So

2961
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Next

2962
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
The domain name

2963
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
FinalFantasy13-2game.com

2964
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Has been registered by Squeenix

2965
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
So everyone's all

2966
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Freaking out about what this means

2967
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Maybe Lightning is going to become a pop singer

2968
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Just like What's-Her-Name

2969
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Final Fantasy X

2970
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
So yeah

2971
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
That was registered

2972
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Along with a bunch of other domains

2973
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
For their

2974
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
N-I-E-R

2975
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Nier

2976
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Nier and Mindjack

2977
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
So a bunch of domains were registered

2978
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
For those properties

2979
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Square is holding a

2980
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
First production

2981
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Party premiere event in Japan

2982
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
For two days on the 18th

2983
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
So people are like what titles

2984
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
And little side story

2985
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Projects are they going to announce

2986
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Maybe we'll finally get to see something from

2987
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Final Fantasy 13 Versus

2988
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Which very well could be just being released here

2989
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
As Final Fantasy 13-2

2990
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Versus 13 for the PS3

2991
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And then the Fabula

2992
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
The PSP

2993
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Part of the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy

2994
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Those two titles are still

2995
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I don't want to call them vaporware

2996
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
We know that they exist

2997
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
So there's that

2998
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Maybe we'll find out about

2999
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Kingdom Hearts 3

3000
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Maybe

3001
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Maybe we'll find out

3002
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
That would be a great E3 announcement though

3003
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Final Fantasy 7

3004
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Remake maybe

3005
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I'm just flame baiting at this point

3006
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Maybe we'll find out about Final Fantasy 14

3007
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Do-Over

3008
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
The Do-Over expansion

3009
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
If they said they were doing Final Fantasy 6

3010
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
The 3DS

3011
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Then I would

3012
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
That would be enough for me

3013
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
So Square is having some event in two days

3014
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
And they registered 13-2 game

3015
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Final Fantasy 13-2.com

3016
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
So speculate to your heart's content

3017
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Last quick fire story for me

3018
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Is that some of the retail

3019
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Marketing assets

3020
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
For Marvel versus Capcom 3

3021
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Have Akuma

3022
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
On them as a playable character

3023
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
It's just a print

3024
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Assets for the game

3025
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
And I guess apparently Akuma

3026
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Hasn't been really made official

3027
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
On that roster

3028
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Well I would kind of think duh Akuma is in it

3029
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
But I guess this is the first time we've seen

3030
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Akuma in print material

3031
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
For MVC 3

3032
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Geez do we have the full roster yet?

3033
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Because it seems like every week there's some damn story about

3034
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Oh this character is in it

3035
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Well in this little

3036
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Sample graphic here it's got Akuma

3037
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
On Bonn which we already knew about

3038
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Albert Wesker, I don't know if I knew about him

3039
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Yeah he was announced

3040
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
A while ago. And then Arthur of course

3041
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
From Ghosts and Goblins

3042
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
So yeah

3043
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
So we know that Akuma

3044
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Is at least in print material for the game

3045
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
So maybe he's unlockable

3046
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
But he's in there

3047
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Alright we'll see

3048
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
For now let's go to the Twitter

3049
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
We're going to get some tweets

3050
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Every week we ask you guys to show us your tweets

3051
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
At twitter.com slash o-l-r

3052
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
And we're going to read some messages

3053
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Sent to us right now

3054
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
We'll start off with Spassinator PSN

3055
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Send us a couple tweets here

3056
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
There's been a ton of free stuff put onto the PSN

3057
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Video store lately

3058
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
The usual spot so be sure to check it out

3059
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
So if you like free videos

3060
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
You can check that out

3061
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Hopefully your console doesn't get borked if you try to hack it

3062
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
And then you'll lose that rights to all that video content

3063
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
So be careful

3064
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Retertainment, I like this tweet

3065
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Which console would compete better on Jeopardy?

3066
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
The 360

3067
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
The PS3

3068
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Or the Wii

3069
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Cause you know if you haven't heard there's that whole computer

3070
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
That's going on Jeopardy that's supposed to be doing battle

3071
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Against what like Ken Jennings

3072
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
And I don't know somebody else

3073
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Whatever

3074
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
So I don't know, what do you guys think?

3075
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Which console would compete best on Jeopardy?

3076
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I would guess the Playstation 3

3077
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Because of that whole

3078
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Uber chip that's inside it

3079
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
It's kind of got the best

3080
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Computer parts

3081
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
If you will

3082
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Well the 360 would call Alex Trebek a fag

3083
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
And then the panel would go red

3084
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
The right on screen

3085
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
It would go red and then it would just sit there

3086
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
For the rest of the show

3087
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
And Alex Trebek would be like

3088
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
So yeah

3089
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
And then the Wii

3090
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
The Wii couldn't even connect to the internet

3091
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
To be able to play the game

3092
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
I'm gonna say the PS3

3093
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Act Def sends us a link to a story

3094
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
About a video game pirate trades

3095
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Sales for Steam

3096
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
It's a link to a story on Kotaku

3097
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
About a video game pirate who has reformed

3098
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
And wrote this whole story

3099
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I'm not gonna read the whole damn story

3100
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
But he you know

3101
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Wrote this whole little piece for Kotaku

3102
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And talked about how he was a pirate

3103
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
And a thief and so forth

3104
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
He said near the end of 2010

3105
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
He had stopped playing PC games all together

3106
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
And if he ended up liking a game

3107
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
He wouldn't even bother to order it

3108
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
He'd just keep playing it until he beat it and then move on

3109
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Then Steam I guess changed his mind

3110
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
He has been a user on Steam for five years

3111
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
And then

3112
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
He would I guess wake up during the holiday sale

3113
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
And see what games he's going to buy

3114
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Having the convenience of Steam

3115
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
To download games right there

3116
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Was enough for him

3117
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
He bought 22 games over the course of the sale

3118
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
There you go

3119
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
I guess the 3DS too is something else that's

3120
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Making him reform

3121
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
You can read the whole piece there on Kotaku

3122
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Another link sent to us on Twitter

3123
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
From SJ100Matt says

3124
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
It's a link about a group of fans remaking

3125
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Sonic 2 in HD

3126
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
This is yet another one of those things

3127
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Where I remember one of these

3128
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Not that long ago there was a story about

3129
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
A Sonic game that was being like remade

3130
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Or like a whole new HD Sonic game

3131
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
That looked better than Sonic 4

3132
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I think Jamie had the story

3133
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
And she was reporting on it

3134
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
And what Sega's putting out

3135
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
And now there's this whole little teaser on YouTube

3136
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I guess for a remade

3137
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Sonic 2 in HD

3138
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Now it just looks like old school Sonic

3139
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
But in widescreen and high def

3140
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
It looks great

3141
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Why the fuck isn't this on Xbox Live?

3142
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I can't

3143
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I love how all the fans

3144
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Try to one-up Sega though

3145
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
It's like at what point does

3146
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Flattery become insult

3147
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Like seriously I don't even know

3148
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Defective Candy sends us a tweet

3149
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
The first kinetic app

3150
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Has shown up in the Mac App Store

3151
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
It's called the Connect 3D Viewer

3152
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
App and you can plug the USB Connect

3153
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Into the app

3154
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
I'm sorry into your Mac and you get a

3155
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
3D visualization of the depth

3156
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Data you can also map

3157
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
RGB values on the image

3158
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
You can zoom and rotate the

3159
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Visualization so it kind of looks like an

3160
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Old school like Max Headroom thing from the 80's

3161
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
In this little clip you see there

3162
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Yeah now that the Mac App Store is open

3163
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
People are putting all sorts of creative things

3164
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Up on there so that's interesting

3165
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
If I had a Mac I'd probably be checking that out

3166
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Unfortunately I only have an iPhone

3167
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
And I can't hook up my connect to my iPhone

3168
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Let's see

3169
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Tigerclaw305 on Twitter sends us a few

3170
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Tweets, one of them has to do

3171
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
This whole thing about the

3172
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Hacking of the Playstation 3

3173
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Apparently there's something going on there that's threatening the

3174
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Trophy system

3175
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
The PS3 Unlocker is this app that's out there

3176
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
You can only use it on a jailbroken

3177
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Console and I guess what happens is that

3178
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
You can actually unlock trophies for

3179
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Buzz, Quiz, TV, Disc

3180
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
You get 100% of the trophies

3181
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
But not every game works like Resident Evil 5

3182
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Gold Edition and Batman Arkham Asylum

3183
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Don't work yet

3184
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
So wow

3185
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
That sucks actually

3186
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
For Sony if that happens

3187
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Because there's just going to be so many people

3188
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
That abuse that and it's too bad

3189
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
They could easily ban those people

3190
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
That do that. They do that for Xbox

3191
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Live right now because you can do that already

3192
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
With JTAG consoles

3193
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
But I mean

3194
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
You can tell

3195
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Usually you can tell

3196
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Hey he has a 2 million

3197
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Gamer score

3198
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
That's a little weird

3199
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Probably a little high

3200
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I enjoy metagaming and the whole

3201
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Semi-EP'ing achievement point thing

3202
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
WoW has it, Xbox has it

3203
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I think it's neat but I just

3204
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Can't imagine who is taking this seriously

3205
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Enough to where they want to hack themselves

3206
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Up into the 50,000 score

3207
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
So they can go hey look at my gamer card

3208
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Look at my score

3209
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Who is that person because I want to meet them and maybe

3210
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Push them down some stairs

3211
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Yeah I mean it's like you know

3212
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Big fucking deal, like woo

3213
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
You unlocked everything and you did it by cheating

3214
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
It's unfortunate

3215
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Someone who does it legitimately

3216
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Gets some really cool

3217
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Achievement but you know

3218
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
The person who unlocks the most

3219
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Maximum achievements in one game

3220
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Isn't good at every single game

3221
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
And that's okay

3222
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
It's just like in the Olympics the same competitors

3223
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Don't do every single sport

3224
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Unless you're looking at something like the Decathlon

3225
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
But that's different

3226
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
And XBLA will occasionally feature

3227
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
A gamer on Xbox Live that has a really

3228
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
High number, sometimes it'll be

3229
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
An Iraqi vet

3230
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
That's now disabled and they play Xbox

3231
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
With a 50,000 XBLA score

3232
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
And that's interesting to find out about the people

3233
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
That have numbers that high because they just

3234
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Play that much

3235
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
And a hack like this kind of takes away from

3236
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
The few people that you know

3237
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Have made a name for themselves out of metagaming

3238
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
So yeah

3239
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
So stopping a dick basically folks

3240
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
This is just a dick thing to do is to unlock all the trophies

3241
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
That you didn't earn

3242
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Dick, alright

3243
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Moving on to another tweet, the last tweet tonight

3244
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Also from Tigerclaw

3245
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I guess is going on there

3246
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Epic Games has an upcoming first person shooter

3247
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Called Bulletstorm

3248
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I guess the Xbox Live and Playstation Network

3249
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Demo is coming out on January 25th

3250
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
If you want to check this out and see if this is the game for you

3251
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
The demo will have

3252
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Usage of the echo mode

3253
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
It's a score based mode in the game

3254
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Where you can use skill shots

3255
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
And so forth

3256
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
45 of the game skill shots will be in there

3257
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
As well as a range of weapons

3258
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
So it sounds like you'll be able to get a pretty good taste for the game there

3259
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
We'll get into stores

3260
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
On February 22nd

3261
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
And there you go

3262
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
We got one more tweet to us

3263
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
From DarkSakura on Twitter

3264
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Tweets us saying

3265
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Why you so hot?

3266
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I don't know if she's listening

3267
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
On the mobile thing

3268
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
If you have an iPhone or whatever

3269
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
You can just go to allgames.com

3270
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
And it's like HTML5 now

3271
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
You don't need an app anymore

3272
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
There used to be an app, you don't need it anymore

3273
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
You can listen to all games while you're on the road

3274
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
So she might be doing that

3275
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
So hi Jamie if you're listening

3276
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
They're really close

3277
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
She's at the IKEA, that's only 20 minutes away

3278
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
So she's going to make it

3279
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Probably just in time for phone calls

3280
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
But I think you're doing a fabulous job

3281
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
So you would make DarkSakura very proud

3282
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I want to do this last story before

3283
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Well let's hurry up and get there

3284
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Because we're through Twitter topics

3285
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
So we've got a couple more stories here

3286
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
We'll go to Loki

3287
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Ah yes, so we were talking a little bit about

3288
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
The 3DS and stuff

3289
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Of course not all of the news is great

3290
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
They're going to be first off

3291
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Region locking the console

3292
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Which is not a huge surprise

3293
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Because the DSi, at least the DSiWare part

3294
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Was actually region locked

3295
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
But now they've kind of gone against

3296
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
What they've been doing with the NDS and stuff

3297
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
And they're just locking the console

3298
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
As I said before in our first story

3299
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,000
You're just giving the hackers another excuse

3300
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
To try to crack your system

3301
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Because now instead of like

3302
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Oh I want to install Linux on it

3303
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Now they're like, well I want to play games for other regions

3304
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
So I'm going to hack this

3305
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
And this is going to be my justification for doing that

3306
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
So

3307
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I don't know, it sucks

3308
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
It says

3309
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
It looks like, for example

3310
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
If you play a Korean 3DS game

3311
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
With a Japanese 3DS system

3312
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Or vice versa

3313
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
You won't be able to play it at all

3314
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Nintendo hasn't actually

3315
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Responded to the comment

3316
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
About it

3317
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
But they haven't really said it

3318
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
It says there's no region codes in DS and DS Lite

3319
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
But the DSi, DSi Excel

3320
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
And 3DS have region codes

3321
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Region codes are installed in each game

3322
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
And the 3DS itself

3323
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
You can't play if the region

3324
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Codes are different

3325
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
That's kind of lame

3326
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Boot of that

3327
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Region locking sucks

3328
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I hate it

3329
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
It's what drove me to piracy

3330
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
On the PS1

3331
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Was wanting to play import Japanese games

3332
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
And I couldn't do it

3333
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Just being honest

3334
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
And then of course they're talking about

3335
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Being a little bit more consistent

3336
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
With their first party releases for the 3DS

3337
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
They were saying that

3338
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
With the Nintendo DS right now

3339
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
They're not having

3340
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I don't know, I think they're doing pretty good

3341
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
With the titles that they have coming out

3342
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
They have about one or two titles

3343
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
A month from

3344
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Actually Nintendo

3345
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Or maybe it's like one or two titles every few months

3346
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Because I know, let's see

3347
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Dragon Quest

3348
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Is being published by Nintendo

3349
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
And then Pokemon Black and White

3350
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
And then they've got

3351
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I guess they have a first party

3352
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Wii title for January

3353
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
But they do have Mario Sports Mix

3354
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
For February

3355
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
But they're saying that they're going to be

3356
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Working to

3357
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Have a more consistent release schedule

3358
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
For games

3359
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
So maybe something like once a month

3360
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
And

3361
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
That's kind of cool

3362
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
And they're also targeting other regions

3363
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
As well

3364
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Developing countries additional to its current

3365
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Territories to bring the new handheld

3366
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
The new console to

3367
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
That's good for people

3368
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
That haven't had a lot of

3369
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Console games, maybe Brazil

3370
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Or

3371
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
South America and there's some places

3372
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Down there that could use

3373
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Some new consoles

3374
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I'm excited to hear

3375
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
That they might have more of a

3376
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Constant stream of games

3377
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
It seemed like with the DS it was like

3378
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Especially right after launch

3379
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I seem to remember a lot of games didn't come out

3380
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Almost for a year for the DS

3381
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Here's my thing though

3382
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Are we going to actually get

3383
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
New games

3384
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Or is this going to be like

3385
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Oh yeah and we're porting this

3386
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
We make some N64 and GameCube games

3387
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Over and over and over again

3388
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Look we got

3389
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Super Mario All Stars

3390
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
There's third party developers though

3391
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
And I'm sort of counting on them to not do that to us

3392
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
If that makes sense

3393
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
The Kingdom Hearts game looks interesting

3394
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
And there's plenty others

3395
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Street Fighter 4 looks like it might be the biggest

3396
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Launch game of sorts

3397
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
And I got to admit, how sad is this you guys

3398
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I don't even want to

3399
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Admit this

3400
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
I kind of want the Nintendogs plus cats

3401
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
And I don't know why

3402
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
No I do know why, I want the cats

3403
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I'm not going to buy all three versions like Logie does, no way

3404
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
No I'm not doing that either

3405
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I learned my lesson the hard way

3406
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
You're not even going to buy one version this time

3407
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I'm not buying one

3408
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Well this will make a lot of people even more excited

3409
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
With the 3DS, like I really wish they would do this

3410
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
And I don't know why

3411
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Let me explain, here it is

3412
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Nintendo did an interview with Satoru Iwata

3413
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Called the Iwata Asks interview

3414
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Iwata-san also

3415
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Wants to include 3D video in the future

3416
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
That's what Miyamoto had said

3417
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Iwata said quote

3418
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
I think it would be fun if we were able to include

3419
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Video recording capabilities with future updates

3420
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
That means it's not going to be there on release

3421
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
But perhaps in the future

3422
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Why?

3423
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Why not? Let's do it

3424
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
I mean I realize that 3D videos you can't watch them

3425
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
A whole lot of places except maybe oh you're 3DS

3426
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
But I don't know

3427
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
I think that would be kind of cool

3428
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Like in a way being able to make your own 3D videos

3429
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Of course give it five seconds and there will be a porno

3430
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Give it five seconds

3431
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
And there will be a porno on the 3DS

3432
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
But can you imagine if you could do like video sharing

3433
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Through 3DS

3434
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Like if Nintendo was smart

3435
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
They would

3436
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Introduce this whole like

3437
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Social network file sharing ability

3438
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Like a portal

3439
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Where you could share videos with your friends

3440
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
That you make on the 3DS

3441
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Like my trip to Disneyland

3442
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
They could have a 3D

3443
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
YouTube

3444
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
They could have it if they wanted it

3445
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Do you realize how big that is?

3446
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
With 3D being all the rage and stuff right now

3447
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
But they don't want it

3448
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Because they are so bullheaded

3449
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
If Nintendo was smart

3450
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
They would make 3D YouTube

3451
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Before YouTube can but they won't

3452
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Actually I think YouTube already has 3D U2

3453
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
But the thing is

3454
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
The difference is

3455
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Most computers yet aren't set up to do 3D

3456
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
The 3DS

3457
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
It's a camera and it's the viewer

3458
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
All in one

3459
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Ugh

3460
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
But no

3461
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
They won't do it

3462
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Yes I'm mad

3463
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Because Nintendo just

3464
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
They're hard headed

3465
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Nintendo's hard headed

3466
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
By the way there was also talk about

3467
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
The whole street pass feature

3468
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
As used in Nintendogs plus cats

3469
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
And that was from Hideki Kono

3470
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Quote, when you're using street pass and exchange data with someone

3471
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
In walk mode

3472
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
That person's me is walking whatever puppy he or she has chosen

3473
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Then your me's and puppy's talk

3474
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
And exchange gifts

3475
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
That's supposed to be like when people actually meet

3476
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
In the park walking their dogs

3477
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
And what have you

3478
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Although I've never given another dog walker a gift

3479
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
But anyway that's supposed to be a feature

3480
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
But I don't know I hear about this shit and I go

3481
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Isn't that what the DS was supposed to do?

3482
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Like wasn't your DS supposed to have that

3483
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Always aware thing like what's so special

3484
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
About what the 3DS is doing

3485
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Do you have to hold the 3DS's in a certain way

3486
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
So they can sniff each other's butts

3487
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Is that a feature?

3488
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Maybe I don't know

3489
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Here's what it is to answer your question

3490
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Remember before you had to

3491
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Have a certain game in there and it would

3492
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Be in that mode or whatever

3493
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
If you had to have Nintendogs in your system

3494
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
And they had to be in the sleep mode or whatever

3495
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
They had to have Nintendogs

3496
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
And it would detect them

3497
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
This will pick up anything regardless of what game it is

3498
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
So say for example I have Mario Kart and Nintendogs

3499
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
And someone else has Mario Kart and Nintendogs

3500
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
But they're playing like

3501
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Street Fighter 4 or something like that

3502
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
It'll still tag my system

3503
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
With all their other crap

3504
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
There's some clarifications from our chat room

3505
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
At chat.orangemanstrader.com

3506
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Tigerclaw is clarifying the 3D YouTube videos

3507
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Are the red and blue

3508
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
If you have the red and blue glasses you can watch some 3D videos

3509
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
On YouTube

3510
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Yes they have that but there's also the other ones

3511
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
They do have multiple versions of 3D

3512
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I think there's people making

3513
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Self-made 3D stuff right now

3514
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
But it's just, it's very limited

3515
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Azzam in our chat room says

3516
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Nintendo Smart? That's like PS3 unhackable

3517
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
I see what you did there

3518
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Alright

3519
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
SalaciousPop what do you have for us?

3520
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I'm not sure why you put

3521
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
This particular story in the news feed

3522
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
It's amazing

3523
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Because I used to work in

3524
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Adult entertainment and I'm sure if

3525
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Jamie got this story she would just be flustered

3526
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
And annoyed

3527
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
A company named D-Dub Software

3528
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Is putting out a

3529
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Porno, triple X rated

3530
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Indie game called Bonecraft

3531
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Based off of Blizzard's World of Warcraft lore

3532
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Where it's like inspired by

3533
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
But obviously it's close enough

3534
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
To where they can't I guess get sued

3535
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
But yeah so D-Dub

3536
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Software who also put out

3537
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Games, I'm trying to find

3538
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Bonetown, Bonetown is another

3539
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Game of theirs and the Tiger Woods

3540
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Sex game I guess

3541
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Plot summary

3542
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Somewhere in the galaxy there's Orcs and Elves

3543
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
This isn't a direct quote

3544
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I'm just paraphrasing it because otherwise it would be too long

3545
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Orcs and Elves running around

3546
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Space Marines crash land on the

3547
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Planet and I guess there's something about

3548
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Secret Elf

3549
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Brothels and I'm sure

3550
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
You move your mouse up and down

3551
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
To do the sex and I don't even know what this is

3552
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
What is this I don't even

3553
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
But yeah, Bonecraft the World of War

3554
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Or the Blizzard sort of

3555
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Starcraft Warcraft genre

3556
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Porno game

3557
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I love that it's combining Warcraft

3558
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
And Starcraft together in its parody

3559
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Yeah so for those that

3560
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Want to

3561
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Google that when they're by themselves

3562
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
The door closed, that's

3563
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
And locked, lock it

3564
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
You lock the door

3565
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
D-Dub Software

3566
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
And the game is a Bonecraft

3567
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
So that's some lol's for you there

3568
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
An actual video game and not just a porno

3569
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
It kind of reminds me of

3570
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
30 Rock

3571
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Season 3 when Tracy Jordan was

3572
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Gonna quit television to make the most

3573
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Amazing porn computer game of all time

3574
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I don't know if anyone watches 30 Rock

3575
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Maybe this is it

3576
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
We should get the creators of this on the show

3577
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Like let's totally take them seriously

3578
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
And just be like you know so tell us about

3579
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
The plot of your game like how do you

3580
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Envision your hero

3581
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Come on you know you want it

3582
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Episode 400 interview with Bonecraft

3583
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Yes or no? What do you think?

3584
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I think we should

3585
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
That's gonna be the drunk show

3586
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
What would you ask the creators of Bonecraft

3587
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Logie? I don't know

3588
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I'd have to learn more about their

3589
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Title I guess

3590
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Well the title is Bonecraft

3591
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I understand that but what the hell's

3592
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
The game I mean

3593
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Bone town is just some really crappy

3594
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Avatar game where people talk dirty to

3595
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Each other I mean that's

3596
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
It doesn't tell me anything

3597
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Alright let's get to some

3598
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
More stories and then the mailbag

3599
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
And the FUs of the week are all coming right up

3600
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I mean seriously

3601
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
What is Bonecraft?

3602
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
What is it?

3603
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Um

3604
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Alright so you know

3605
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
PSP2

3606
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Let's not talk about it because you know

3607
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
No one's announced it yet but it might

3608
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Be announced very soon actually there is

3609
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
A rumor that the PSP2 will be unveiled

3610
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
This month in Tokyo at a Sony

3611
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Business meeting and it has been confirmed

3612
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
That such a meeting is being held

3613
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
In Tokyo on January 27

3614
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
This was confirmed by

3615
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Sony themselves of course they say

3616
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
They can't comment on anything at this time

3617
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Which probably means that yes

3618
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
They are going to be announcing it at that time

3619
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Um

3620
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
So that's cool so if they announce it this year

3621
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I'm assuming it will probably be coming out this year

3622
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
It'll probably be at E3 so

3623
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Um I guess we'll have to wait and see

3624
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
When that

3625
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
PSP2 is coming out

3626
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
That doesn't exist but does exist

3627
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Yeah

3628
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
By the way it

3629
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Missed our show roll tonight

3630
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
But E3 I guess is now open

3631
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Taking registrations and all that fun stuff

3632
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I know because we've been kind of looking into it trying to make our plan

3633
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
For E3 this year which sadly we

3634
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Already know Loki's not going based on things he said

3635
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
On the show before but uh

3636
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
I am doing everything I can in my power to go

3637
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
This year because you know I think I've said this before

3638
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
On the show this year is going to be either

3639
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
The best E3 ever or the worst

3640
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
E3 ever I honestly

3641
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Think because it's going to be all about

3642
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
You know where they're going to go

3643
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
With these new fangled things

3644
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
They've got on consoles

3645
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
What's next? Where's your killer app?

3646
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I really don't think anyone's going to be announcing

3647
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
A new console this year

3648
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
I don't think the

3649
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Wii HD is happening at a Nintendo at this point

3650
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Because I think they're going to really throw everything

3651
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
They've gotten to the 3DS this year

3652
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
It's everything you're going to be seeing

3653
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Sony and Microsoft

3654
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Have no reason to give up what they're doing on their

3655
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Consoles right now so

3656
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Well I guess the PSP2

3657
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Would be the one console that you're probably going to see

3658
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
More information about

3659
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
That wasn't announced earlier

3660
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
As we've heard it might actually come out with Tokyo Game

3661
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Developers Conference who knows

3662
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Could come out a lot sooner

3663
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
It's going to be a very interesting year

3664
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I hopped on this generation of consoles pretty late

3665
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
I didn't get a 360

3666
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Which is the first out of the two that I got

3667
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Until Christmas of 08

3668
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
So a little over two years

3669
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
The idea that the 360 is

3670
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Six years old or will be this summer

3671
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
I know

3672
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I can't wrap my head around that

3673
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
When the new consoles should be

3674
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
They should be announcing a new Xbox this year

3675
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
But it's not time

3676
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
I don't think it's time

3677
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
We've got at least one or two more years out of these things

3678
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Isn't it funny that when we were sitting here

3679
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Because the show has been on this long

3680
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
That we have episodes dating back to when these

3681
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Consoles were debuting and we were sitting here going

3682
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
They're saying that PS3 has a 10 year life cycle

3683
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Come on you're not

3684
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
You're full of crap

3685
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I'm not ready to see new hardware yet

3686
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
I'm not either

3687
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
I'm going to be off if new hardware were out already

3688
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Because it would be all 3D and you need 3D

3689
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
TVs for it and

3690
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Everything

3691
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I don't know

3692
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
You already made me buy upgrades to the current consoles

3693
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
With the Kinect and the Move

3694
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Although I didn't buy the Move

3695
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Give me reasons to really love these things

3696
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
If there's a game to necessitate it

3697
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
There wasn't a game that necessitated me buying it

3698
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I would even argue that maybe

3699
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I shouldn't have bought the Kinect

3700
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
But I do really like Dance Central and some of the other stuff

3701
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
But I really don't have a reason to get a move right now

3702
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
So I don't know

3703
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
There's a lot of people out there saying

3704
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Dark ToaGak in our chatroom says I still don't have a 360

3705
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Are people still calling it next gen consoles?

3706
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Because I think we're past that right?

3707
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
I made that mistake for about two years after it was out

3708
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Next gen

3709
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Next gen

3710
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
There is no next gen yet

3711
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
We'll see

3712
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
One person that wants to play a little more

3713
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
In what's going on in the console world

3714
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
It's GameStop

3715
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
They want to link you with a GameStop ID

3716
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
On their console

3717
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
That's because GameStop is selling more of the digital stuff

3718
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
In their stores

3719
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
They had an interview with Ars Technica

3720
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Not that long ago

3721
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
And the Senior Vice President of GameStop, Sean Freeman

3722
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Said that while the company is doing a good job

3723
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Of selling Microsoft Points cards

3724
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
They're looking to cut some of the friction

3725
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Out of the experience

3726
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
I'm not sure what that means

3727
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
But what they say is that instead of buying a card

3728
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
To go home and input the code

3729
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Ultimately they want you to tie your online account

3730
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
With a GameStop ID

3731
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
So ultimately we want to reduce

3732
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Even more of that friction

3733
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
So when you buy that map pack in our store

3734
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
We're going to be able to associate your Xbox profile

3735
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
With your GameStop profile

3736
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
And then automatically push it to your download queue

3737
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I still never understood

3738
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
The reason why I would want to even do this

3739
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Honestly

3740
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I mean

3741
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
If you're going to

3742
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Say for example

3743
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Buy download content from them

3744
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Just buy a fucking 1600 point card

3745
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Or something like that

3746
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Why are you going to give them your information for this stuff

3747
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Why do you even

3748
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Even if you're not interested in purchasing a ton of download content

3749
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
And you have no games to trade in

3750
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Why the fuck would you ever

3751
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Leave your home

3752
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Go to a store

3753
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
To buy something that you could just flip your console on

3754
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
And download straight from the marketplace

3755
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
And download straight to your console

3756
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
And I tell you

3757
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
By the time you drove to the store and back

3758
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
It would already be downloaded

3759
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
So I just don't understand

3760
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Why you would even like

3761
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Waste the time to go give them money

3762
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
And you're paying tax

3763
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
On top of that

3764
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I'm making stink face at this whole idea

3765
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
To have a separate layer of

3766
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
A GameStop ID

3767
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
That's just yet another account that I have to sync

3768
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
With my XBLA or whatever

3769
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
If they want to be the middle man in that

3770
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Password that could possibly get exploited

3771
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Yeah this is a dumb

3772
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Idea and I don't get it

3773
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Well I think GameStop to some extent is doing what they feel

3774
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
They have to do to survive

3775
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Because I think we've said this on the show before

3776
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
That GameStop is going to go the way of Blockbuster Video

3777
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Real soon

3778
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
If something doesn't happen

3779
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Here's the thing, they're not going anywhere

3780
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Because they're the biggest fish in the sea

3781
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
So was Blockbuster at one time

3782
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
No no no no

3783
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
This is totally different because you see

3784
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
The publisher or the movie studios

3785
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
They don't need Blockbuster

3786
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Like they need GameStop

3787
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Because Blockbuster rents

3788
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Movies, they don't sell movies

3789
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
And unfortunately they make more money

3790
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
In the sell through business than they do in the rental business

3791
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
If Blockbuster was a big powerhouse

3792
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
In selling movies that would be a different

3793
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Different thing altogether

3794
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
But GameStop, they're a big powerhouse

3795
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
When it comes to sell through and unfortunately

3796
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
They could dictate

3797
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
To the publishers what the fuck do they want

3798
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Them to do

3799
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
So they say, you know what, we still want you to put physical copies out

3800
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
They're going to put physical copies out

3801
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
They're just trying to get into the DLC

3802
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Stuff because they figure, hey, we can get some

3803
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
More money from that because we can just

3804
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Pay Microsoft or whatever

3805
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Or a small little kickback for these things

3806
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
But we get some money out of that transaction

3807
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
And that's more money for us

3808
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Because we don't actually have to sell any physical goods

3809
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
It's digital stuff now

3810
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
So that's what that's all about

3811
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I mean if they really wanted to

3812
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
I mean they have cards and stuff

3813
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
That I guess they have made for them

3814
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
But that's all it's about

3815
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
It's not about them trying to survive

3816
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
It's about them being fucking greedy

3817
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
That's all it is

3818
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
They don't need to be in this business at all

3819
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Why aren't they selling

3820
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Well I guess I should say

3821
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Why aren't they selling PC games digitally

3822
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
But they are

3823
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
But I mean they're in no way going to be able to

3824
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Compete well with Steam or something

3825
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
It's just

3826
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
We're looking at our comments from chatroom at chat.orangelandtrady.com

3827
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Brad from Pod Culture says

3828
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Used to work at Blockbuster back in the day

3829
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
And yes Blockbuster does sell movies

3830
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
New and used

3831
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I know that they do but they're not like at Walmart

3832
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Where Walmart sells hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

3833
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
And hundreds and hundreds and thousands of movies

3834
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Versus Blockbuster's

3835
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Oh we're bringing in some extra for sell through

3836
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
It's way different

3837
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Way different

3838
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
They never looked at Blockbuster as a big old

3839
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Source of

3840
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Profit for stuff

3841
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Unfortunately things change

3842
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Way back in the day one

3843
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
It was all about VHS tapes

3844
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
And stuff like that

3845
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
And they were charging the Blockbuster's

3846
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Or any video rental place

3847
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Up to $100 per tape

3848
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
That's where they're making the money

3849
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
But then with the advent of DVD

3850
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Unfortunately the cost of goods has come down

3851
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
It's all about quantity

3852
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
And so because of quantity

3853
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Their business has shifted to sell through

3854
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Where a $100 movie was

3855
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Way out of the realm of

3856
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Some consumer purchasing it for themselves

3857
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
So that's why they had to rent it out

3858
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Before it became sell through pricing

3859
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Now everything is released at sell through

3860
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Pricing and so there's really

3861
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
No incentive for somebody to

3862
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Well I mean there is an incentive for people to rent

3863
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Stuff because it's still cheaper but

3864
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
It's less of an incentive now because they can just

3865
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Go to the store and buy their movie

3866
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
New

3867
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Because before they wouldn't be able to do that

3868
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
So that's why it's all shifted to

3869
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
The sell through business and that's why

3870
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Blockbuster is

3871
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Well it's why Blockbuster is failing

3872
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
That and they're losing out to

3873
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Kiosk vendors and stuff like that

3874
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Kind of a funny comment from our chatroom

3875
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
At chat.orangelandtrader.com

3876
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Rama says no GameStop lost their touch when they got rid of the

3877
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Funkoland name

3878
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I remember when Funkoland advertised

3879
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
In magazines and stuff and you could get their little

3880
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Flyer it was all like a mail order thing

3881
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
It was the good old days

3882
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Alright we're going to get into the mail bag here at

3883
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Orangelandtrader.com slash mail bag

3884
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
But just getting into the studio right now

3885
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Dark Sakura has arrived

3886
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Back from her event. Welcome back

3887
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
You've been missed tonight. How are you doing?

3888
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I'm pinballed out

3889
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
I played nothing but Rocky and Bullinkle and I

3890
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Played Theater of Magic before we actually got there

3891
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Alright and I apologize in advance

3892
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I have to do some audio adjusting

3893
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
On the fly because Dark Sakura and Salacious Pop are not

3894
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
The same. Salacious Pop was using

3895
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Dark Sakura's microphone so

3896
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Not the same. Yes you have boobies

3897
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Yes and they are magnificent

3898
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Well how was the pinball event? You want to tell us real quick

3899
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
About it? I know it was a private thing so it wasn't

3900
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Like a public event but

3901
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
It was pretty cool. He had a lot of good tables

3902
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
And there was like 25 people over

3903
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
There and Steve Ritchie was there

3904
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
And he was really cool

3905
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I mentioned earlier in the show you were texting me this morning

3906
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
That you were rubbing elbows with some famous

3907
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Pinball peeps. That's pretty cool

3908
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Did you give us an interview for the show?

3909
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
No but his wife and I talked for a long time

3910
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
And she's really sweet. Oh good

3911
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Yeah um

3912
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Yeah Dan's in there saying we probably could

3913
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
He's really cool. I mean I've just

3914
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Sat and chatted with him before at

3915
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Convention so. Sure. What tables did he work on?

3916
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Um he did

3917
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
No Fear and

3918
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Black Knight which are both ones that we have

3919
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
And he did the voices in them. Oh right because you're

3920
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Very proud of your autograph on those right?

3921
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Dan just come in here and answer the damn questions

3922
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Dan just been driving for two hours

3923
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
You was away. You were like in the Bay Area right?

3924
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Um actually somewhere

3925
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Near French Camp

3926
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Oh that's not down by Stockton. Okay

3927
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Yeah just past Stockton. Oh you're going the other way

3928
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
But we rode with someone in Davis

3929
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
So that's why

3930
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
We gave the update from Davis

3931
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Sure sure gotcha

3932
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
But I played a lot of Rocky and Bull Eagle

3933
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
And there was a whirlwind

3934
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
And uh

3935
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Safe Cracker I think was one of them

3936
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
And uh they have

3937
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Really really pretty Twilight Zone

3938
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Like with the topper and everything

3939
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
And uh

3940
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
All kinds of good stuff

3941
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Rob would you like a chair?

3942
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
And uh

3943
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Yeah sorry for the dead air

3944
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I'm getting hammered with chat and chairs

3945
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Switcheroo and all that at once. Live radio folks

3946
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
He hit him with the metal chair!

3947
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Boom! No

3948
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Um but it was

3949
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
It was pretty fun and then my

3950
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Hips started to hurt and I started to get grumpy

3951
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
So I sat down and got on my

3952
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Laptop for a little bit and you know

3953
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I had a lot of beer

3954
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Good times. So you've been drinking a little bit

3955
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Three New Castles and a Guinness. That's not a lot

3956
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
That's nothing for you. You should have seen me last night

3957
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I mentioned this earlier on the show. I was out with

3958
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Rice Princess and X-tifer and Grandpa

3959
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Warcraft from the other show and

3960
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Salacious Pop here. We were all out and I

3961
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Got drunk. Like I made a

3962
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Ass of myself in front of Rice Princess and X-tifer

3963
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
I know I actually will. Oh sorry you were

3964
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Muted there Salacious Pop. I'm sorry

3965
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
I was drunk that he agreed to go to Denny's

3966
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
For the after bar food

3967
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I hate Denny's with a passion

3968
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Like I just burned out on Denny's in my

3969
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Early 20's right

3970
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
That was the post club place to go

3971
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Well keep in mind for the rest of you guys that aren't in California

3972
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
We don't really have diners here

3973
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Like diners are unheard of here. There is no such thing

3974
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
As a waffle house. Which is a shame

3975
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
No mom and pa diners. There's nothing like that

3976
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
We have Denny's. Denny's, Denny's, Denny's, Denny's

3977
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Everywhere. Well we had Lion's and we had Epi's

3978
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
None of them are 24 hours anymore

3979
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
And they're gone

3980
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
It's Denny's and last night when I was drunk

3981
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I wanted chicken strips

3982
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
They sobered him right up

3983
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Greasy chicken strips. They're good. Hang over here

3984
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Well you remember my last super drunk time

3985
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
That I was hanging out with you other than the time

3986
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
At Tia's when they lit up in the apartment

3987
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
And it made me throw up

3988
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Was the waffles

3989
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
The waffle incident

3990
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
It's carby stuff Rob

3991
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
It's the greasy carby stuff

3992
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Well I guess I should pull up the chatroom

3993
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
You'd be very proud of

3994
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
We've gotten through most of your news tonight already

3995
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
You'd be very proud of Salacious Pop. He did a fine job

3996
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
He picked the classic game of the week tonight

3997
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
What was it?

3998
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
King's Quest IV

3999
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Of course the Rosella game

4000
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Which was one of the best in the series

4001
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Figured since you tended to give

4002
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Sega a lot of love

4003
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Because Sega deserves my love

4004
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Salacious Pop went to the PC market

4005
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
We did determine today

4006
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
On the ride back that Sega makes

4007
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Crappy pinball tables

4008
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag you guys

4009
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
At mailbag

4010
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
At orangeloungeradio.com

4011
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
And sadly there is not a lot in the

4012
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Mailbag tonight

4013
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Where's my mailbag music?

4014
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Is there Viagra spam? Because you can just read that

4015
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Not this week

4016
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I'll go ahead and do it since Dark Soccer is still getting

4017
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Do you want to be uncomfortably hard?

4018
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Well also

4019
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
A lot of it's my fault with the whole lack

4020
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Of podcast feed updating

4021
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
But again a new show went up today

4022
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
And will continue throughout the three day weekend

4023
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I have tomorrow off so I'm going to work on OLR stuff

4024
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Before I forget, 71

4025
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Is what?

4026
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Since we were keeping track of my levels

4027
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Oh god

4028
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
I already told you last night

4029
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Alright, anyhow

4030
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Let's get into this email from

4031
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
RobWithTwoB's

4032
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
And this is actually somewhat of a serious email

4033
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Because obviously we had that tragedy that happened in Arizona

4034
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Which is just

4035
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Unfortunately some bonehead

4036
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Did something really really really

4037
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Really really bad

4038
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
And now it's making a lot of people think

4039
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Differently and in response

4040
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Let me read the email here

4041
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
From Rob

4042
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
In response to Jared Lee Lauder gun attack

4043
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
It appears the following article replaces video games

4044
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
With political rhetoric

4045
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
The article is good even though the study mentioned is weak

4046
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
And he links us to the story from Boing Boing

4047
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
The bottom line is that you have to be

4048
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
A violent person to begin with

4049
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Let me kind of go to the story real quick

4050
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
And try to pick out some of this stuff

4051
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Oh yeah

4052
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
They just kind of go through

4053
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
This study and they just replace

4054
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
The words video games with violent rhetoric

4055
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
And it's kind of like, gee haven't we seen this whole thing before?

4056
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
IDK

4057
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
But Rob

4058
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Says my point of view and I know I've said this before in a mail bag letter

4059
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Is that a person is solely responsible

4060
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
For what influences him or her

4061
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Although from what I've read of the Arizona shooting

4062
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
The shooter was extremely mentally ill

4063
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
And without treatment

4064
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
We may be looking at a situation where the parents

4065
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Did not know about paranoid schizophrenia

4066
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
And therefore didn't get treatment for him

4067
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Don't worry though, video games are also being blamed

4068
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Of course, aren't they always?

4069
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
From all with two B's

4070
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
And it's just unfortunate, you know, in these times of tragedy

4071
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Everybody's, you know, kind of pointing the finger

4072
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
At what there is to blame

4073
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
And I don't know

4074
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
All of it's to blame to an extent

4075
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
But what's most to blame

4076
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Is this individual

4077
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
An individual is responsible for their actions

4078
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
And it's, I don't know

4079
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
It's just, it's a

4080
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Not an easy situation with not an easy answer to it

4081
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
But, you know, you have to look to how to

4082
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Prevent this type of stuff in the future

4083
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
And we're all gonna pay for it

4084
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Because, you know, it's not gonna be, it's gonna

4085
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Make our Congress people less accessible

4086
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
In the future

4087
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
It's just unfortunate

4088
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
And yeah, I kind of agree with Frisbee in our chat room

4089
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
This guy is a psycho, end of line

4090
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Yeah, that's, that's kind of how I

4091
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Feel about it

4092
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
There you go, that's it for the emails this week

4093
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com

4094
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
I'm expecting this thing to be full next week

4095
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Full with stories next week

4096
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Loki has another news story

4097
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
For us, and then we're gonna get to the Skype line

4098
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Here in just a minute at Orangelaunchradio on

4099
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Skype or our phone number

4100
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
1-877-GAME-OLR

4101
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Yes, last thing I have to talk

4102
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
About, and this is not a surprise

4103
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
I mean, I guess this is a surprise for a Wii game

4104
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Just Dance 2 has gone

4105
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Five times platinum, that's right

4106
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
It sold five million copies

4107
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
And that's not bad

4108
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
For considering the fact it came out

4109
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
At the end of October

4110
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
That's way too much Kesha, for me

4111
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
That's way too much

4112
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
That's insane though, that it's done that well

4113
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I mean, yeah, to put this

4114
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
In contrast, we just had a story earlier in the show

4115
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Where you were saying, hey, Dance Central's doing great

4116
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
It sold one million copies

4117
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
We just mentioned now

4118
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Just Dance has sold

4119
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Just Dance 2, excuse me, has sold five

4120
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Million copies

4121
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
It's not like Just Dance franchise has sold five million copies

4122
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
This one game has sold five million copies

4123
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
That is crazy

4124
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
It is so popular

4125
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I'm surprised

4126
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
That Ubisoft hasn't brought

4127
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
The Just Dance franchise

4128
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
To other consoles now

4129
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
They have the Move and the Kinect stuff

4130
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Well, the Michael Jackson game

4131
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Isn't that really just a Just Dance Michael Jackson game?

4132
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
It's coming out on the other systems

4133
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
I bet you though that we'll see Just Dance 3 come out on all the platforms

4134
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Oh, I'm sure

4135
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
The Move would be

4136
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Stupid easy to port

4137
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Because it's very similar

4138
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Kinect, a little different

4139
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
And it's going to be hard to separate it now

4140
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Like Dance Central kind of beat them to the punch a little bit on Kinect

4141
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
But if Dance Central

4142
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
And Dance Masters can kind of coexist

4143
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
And Dance Paradise

4144
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Oh yeah, that one

4145
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
That's not out here, is it?

4146
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Okay, then I guess there'll be room for this too

4147
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
But you know what?

4148
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Then I think I've had enough dancing games

4149
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
They need to kill each other off in a battle royale

4150
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
And one will be left standing

4151
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Which will probably be Dance Central

4152
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Get some Highlander up in this

4153
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
For real, I want to see the head chopped off of Dance Masters

4154
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:12,000
There can be only one

4155
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
And make it be really good and I will buy that one

4156
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Evacuate the dance floor

4157
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Alright, forget it

4158
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Moving on to one more song here

4159
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
One more story here

4160
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Maybe it'll have a song and dance with it

4161
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Cooking Mama has arrived on Facebook

4162
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
That's right

4163
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Mama will fix Facebook now

4164
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
The Cooking Mama franchise has arrived on Facebook this week

4165
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Friends Cafe

4166
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Is the name of the game

4167
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
So we're going to dub it then Clicky Mama, right?

4168
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Yes, Clicky Mama

4169
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
That's right, Clicky Mama

4170
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Don't worry, Mama will click it

4171
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
You can visit the game at facebook.com slash

4172
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Cooking Mama Cafe

4173
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
It has some of the same food preparation

4174
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Gameplay, of course

4175
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
That you're used to seeing in the series

4176
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
There's also unlockable upgrades

4177
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
For your personal kitchen

4178
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Of course, you can buy them as well

4179
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Cause it's a Facebook game

4180
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
And if you neglect your cafe, you will see it shut down

4181
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Aww

4182
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
So there you go

4183
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
If you want to see what's going on in the Cooking Mama world

4184
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
You can now explore that on Facebook

4185
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I wonder how many people will abandon Knights of the Crystals

4186
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
To go play Friends Cafe

4187
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
I don't know

4188
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Oh god

4189
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
83, I'm level 83 in that game

4190
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
And I think Slice is Pop is actually higher than me

4191
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Yeah, I've run out of stuff to do, really

4192
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
In Knights of the Clicky

4193
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Knights of the Clicky is not even a good game

4194
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
I've already given up on it

4195
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Why do I keep playing it?

4196
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Rob wants help!

4197
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Yay, thank you, I appreciate it

4198
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
They have released new stages

4199
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Like I just unlocked the Merman

4200
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
From doing the underwater stages

4201
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
So that's about all they do

4202
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
But for every new map that they open up

4203
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
They also release one that only requires pay items

4204
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Of course

4205
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
That's how it works

4206
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
You know what? It's all going to shit when the Civilization game comes out

4207
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
That's how I feel

4208
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
I want that damn Civilization game now

4209
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
That's when you'll dust off your credit card for a Facebook title

4210
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
For real

4211
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Alright, we're going to open up the Skypline

4212
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
It is open right now

4213
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
We're going to do the Effies of the Week

4214
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
We didn't do the Effies of the Week yet

4215
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
I'm bad

4216
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I did a bad thing and we didn't get the angst out

4217
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Oh Rob, you're so bad

4218
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I was just distracted by you getting back to the studio

4219
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
My DJ's so bad?

4220
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Uh, F you to my hip

4221
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Fucker

4222
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Done

4223
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Slaces pop

4224
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Um, F you I guess

4225
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
To me not really knowing how awesome Panera Bread is

4226
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Up until just recently

4227
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
It's a pretty good month so far

4228
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
No angst

4229
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Um

4230
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
F you to the fact that I have a very tough decision coming up

4231
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
And I think I know what I'm going to do

4232
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
And it's not going to make some people very happy with me

4233
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
But in the end I know that it's the thing I've got to do

4234
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
It has nothing to do with me

4235
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
It has nothing to do with this program or anything you guys know about me

4236
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
So it's just

4237
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
I'm being cryptical on purpose

4238
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
But I don't like these tough decisions

4239
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
I think I know what it is

4240
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Oh you do, I know you do

4241
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
But sorry listeners, it's private

4242
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Loki

4243
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Uh, F you to my JTAC constantly being broken

4244
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
And it was really broken

4245
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
I actually sent it away to be re-balled

4246
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Which is where they pull the chips off

4247
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
And they put new solder balls on them

4248
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
They actually have lead in them

4249
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
How they should have been

4250
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
And that didn't even fix it

4251
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
So uh

4252
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
It's broke

4253
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Alright

4254
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
That's going to do it for the FUs of the week

4255
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Let's go to the Skype line but we're going to start the Skype line tonight

4256
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
With something a little special

4257
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
We're actually going to place a call right now

4258
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
And uh

4259
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Get him on the line here

4260
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
So we can get an update on what's going on

4261
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
With one of our partner shows

4262
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Hi Breslil are you there?

4263
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
What? Huh? Breslil how you doing?

4264
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Hi Hi

4265
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Hi Hi

4266
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Guy? Hi

4267
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
What? What? Oh shit

4268
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Alright Breslil is helping out with a big old

4269
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
To do thing at Under Sedation Live

4270
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
They're our pals and buddies and I say that mostly

4271
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Because that's the show I started on

4272
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
And they are live of course Saturday nights here

4273
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
At All Games Radio and uh

4274
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
We like to help out with a little thing called

4275
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
USLOLR Madness

4276
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Yeah and it's

4277
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
I have learned something I am not expanding it

4278
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
To 96 games next year

4279
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
There's a lot of shit that gets in there honestly

4280
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I voted on the

4281
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Current brackets and there's some weird shit in there

4282
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Yeah it's because people

4283
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
People like SSJ-100

4284
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Matt say hey Blade's a steal number one

4285
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
And then it gets a 12 seed

4286
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
So anyways

4287
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Voting for the Breslil region

4288
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Actually closes in about half an hour

4289
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
For the first region it will close

4290
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
And then I'll announce the

4291
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Next line of games when we get into the real meat

4292
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
And potatoes basically Chrono Trigger comes

4293
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
To play that's all that happens

4294
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
But I have some scores here of some games

4295
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
I thought you all would be interested in

4296
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Alrighty

4297
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
So I'll start with the OLR region because it's your

4298
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Region

4299
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Secret of Mana

4300
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Is beating Katamari

4301
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Namashe right now

4302
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
It's pretty close. Quake is losing

4303
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
To Half Life

4304
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I'm okay with both of those

4305
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Sometimes and the weird thing about

4306
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
USL Madness is that sometimes the pairings

4307
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Are really hard early on

4308
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
And you know that's true of any tournament

4309
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Comp style competition but sometimes the pairings

4310
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
This early on like Quake vs

4311
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Half Life those are both games that deserve

4312
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
To move on but just the way the brackets are set up

4313
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
It's not gonna happen you know

4314
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
And um

4315
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
What else was I gonna say about that you know

4316
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
It's like Mega Man 2 vs Mega Man 3 last year

4317
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
That was just probably one of the toughest decisions

4318
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
I had to make

4319
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
At that point you know there really only

4320
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Needed to be one Mega Man game that represents

4321
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Them all you know

4322
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Yeah but moving on the last one

4323
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
And this is a Bemani one so I had to throw it in there

4324
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Para Para Paradise is

4325
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Narrowly losing to Sinistar right now

4326
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
That is such a weird

4327
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Match up

4328
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Yeah I don't know how that works

4329
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
You know what though as much as I love my

4330
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Dancy games I don't think Para Para

4331
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Is the dancy game I would choose to represent

4332
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Sorry Misty I know you're gonna hate me for that

4333
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
But Sinistar did bring us the whole

4334
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Beware I live

4335
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Which is pretty awesome

4336
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Moving on to the Harper region

4337
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Wow is barely beating Bionic Commando

4338
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
It's by like a vote

4339
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Wow

4340
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Yeah exactly

4341
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Pong is beating System Shock

4342
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
And probably the most bizarre first round

4343
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Match up and it's beating it pretty soundly

4344
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Here's a head scratcher

4345
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Kingdom Hearts is beating

4346
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Markham Asylum

4347
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Interesting

4348
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Well I

4349
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Knowing the listeners of this show

4350
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
That mostly prefer the import

4351
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Stuff I mean if I were to say you know the majority

4352
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Of the listeners not all of them but I know the majority

4353
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Of our folks are kind of into the

4354
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Squeenix import stuff that doesn't

4355
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Surprise me

4356
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
I can't speak for USL but I know we have

4357
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
A lot of the same listeners so it wouldn't surprise me

4358
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
I got sick of Kingdom Hearts

4359
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Pretty quickly but that's just me

4360
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Over to the Donovan region and the other

4361
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Bmoni game in this region

4362
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
If you're wondering where the hell DDR is

4363
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
DDR got a 3 seed so it gets a buy

4364
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
In the first round it doesn't get to play

4365
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
But Popin' Music

4366
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Is playing Perfect Dark and

4367
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
It's not looking good for Popin' Music

4368
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
As it

4369
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
As it doesn't need to be

4370
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Looking good for it

4371
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
And speaking of Blades of Steel it's losing

4372
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
To Dragon Quest 9 right now pretty badly

4373
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Ouch

4374
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
This is one of the Brestler region I'm also not saying

4375
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
All of these games because it would be 32

4376
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Matchups we'd be here forever and Rob, Jamie

4377
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
And Loki have things to do tonight

4378
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Where can you kind of like

4379
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Follow the action on what's going on

4380
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
At USL Madness

4381
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
I haven't been posting the

4382
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Results but

4383
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Time and again I will every day post

4384
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Like oh hey this matchup's close

4385
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Or this region needs votes like the OLR

4386
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Region really needs votes right now so

4387
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
And then I'm gonna

4388
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Finally go to the Brestler region here

4389
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Final Fantasy 10

4390
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Is just barely beating

4391
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Crazy Taxi

4392
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Borderlands

4393
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Is beating the ever loving snot out of the

4394
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Call of Duty series

4395
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Good

4396
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Yeah that one was like

4397
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
That could go either way but I wouldn't be

4398
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Upset if Borderlands went and then here's

4399
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Probably the most interesting one, Techno Super

4400
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Bowl is losing to Halo Reach

4401
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
By about 10%

4402
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
No that's not

4403
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
That is not even the Halo game that should be

4404
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Representing the Halo franchise I'm sorry

4405
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Halo 2 all the way

4406
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
If it was Halo 2 beating it then I'd be a little more

4407
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Sympathetic but Halo Reach no

4408
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
No

4409
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
But those are just some of the matchups

4410
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
If you want to vote I will post the link

4411
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Again in chat if you're listening live

4412
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
The Brestler region closes in

4413
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
20 minutes

4414
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
So you better vote now bitches

4415
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Yeah Donovan regional closed

4416
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Monday night, Harper regional closed Wednesday

4417
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Night and since it was late on OLR

4418
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
OLR region will close Friday night

4419
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Alright and you'll be posting all the updates

4420
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
In our forums at orangeandlongestrader.com correct?

4421
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Yes and probably here before

4422
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
You guys sign off I will have the results of the Brestler

4423
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Region so you see what games go on and what

4424
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Faces what so Alright sounds good

4425
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Thank you for putting this all together it sounds

4426
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
It's a little fun nerd stuff but fun

4427
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Yeah

4428
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
I gotta ask before I go who do you

4429
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Got this year who do you think is gonna win? Who do I think

4430
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Is gonna win this year? Duh Super Metroid

4431
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
It needs to reclaim the throne of course

4432
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I wouldn't

4433
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Be upset if Final Fantasy 6 won

4434
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
For a game

4435
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Because Final Fantasy 6 has never won before

4436
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Right? No it got to the finals for the

4437
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
First time last year I would be okay with that

4438
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
What other games have gotten really close but haven't won

4439
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Yet

4440
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Link to the past

4441
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Ocarina of Time

4442
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Super Mario Brothers

4443
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
And Mega Man 2 all have gotten really close

4444
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
I would be okay with any of those

4445
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Winning the whole thing except for

4446
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Ocarina of Time

4447
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
I'm gonna start

4448
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Ocarina of Time is just like Chrono Trigger

4449
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
To me I don't understand everybody's hard on

4450
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
For it I don't

4451
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Link to the past forever

4452
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Yeah but anyways guys

4453
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
That's it I will

4454
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000

And keep Donovan

02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
And Jessica Harper in check for us

4459
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
I'll try

4460
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Alright later

4461
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000

Let's go right to the phones cause they've been ringing while we were on that last call

4467
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000

Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

4470
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Hey what's up guys

4471

This is Kaijuto Hey Kaijuto there you are

4472
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
What's up buddy

4473
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Not much I just called to recommend

4474
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
The game to you guys Please do what game?

4475
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
It's a PC game

4476
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
It's first person shooter I heard you all

4477
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Talking about you were fans of

4478
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
The original GoldenEye for the N64

4479
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
The original GoldenEye was pretty badass I liked it

4480
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Alright well then

4481
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
You need to pick up this mod you need

4482
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
You need Steam of course you need

4483
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Either Half Life 2

4484
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
I'm not gonna get into all of the games but you know what I'm saying

4485
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
When I say you need a Valve game you need Half Life 2

4486
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Or Portal

4487
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Or Team Fortress you know one of those

4488
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Actually is it Team Fortress I'm not sure

4489
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Just get Half Life 2 Deathmatch which is just $4.99

4490
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
You get that and then you can

4491
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Download this GoldenEye source mod

4492
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Which is the best freaking game

4493
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Period that I've ever played

4494
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I think you all need to check it out

4495
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Interesting you're a big Half Life fan

4496
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
I am hugely into Half Life 2

4497
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
And the source

4498
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Half Life 2 engine I've played a ton of

4499
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Mods and add-ons

4500
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Expansions that are fan made for Half Life 2

4501
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
And I know exactly what he's talking about

4502
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I haven't checked it out

4503
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
But yeah I will now

4504
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I've heard of this it looks pretty awesome

4505
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Yeah they just went out of beta

4506
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Maybe people have played it before

4507
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
You know I guess it was version 2

4508
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Version 3 and maybe they didn't like it

4509
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
But this new update

4510
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
The release version

4511
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Oh my god it'll blow you away

4512
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
The maps are just incredible

4513
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
The first person shooter maps you'll ever play

4514
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
And the first person shooter to date

4515
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
And I mean that

4516
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I'll ban myself from all games

4517
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
If you guys don't like that game

4518
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
That's how dedicated I am

4519
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
You don't have to do that

4520
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Everybody has different opinions

4521
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
I'll check it out especially if it's kind of cheap

4522
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I think I already have Half Life 2

4523
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I can't remember if I have it on PC

4524
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
I think I've been playing it on Xbox

4525
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
But I have Portal and Team Fortress

4526
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Portal should be enough

4527
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Any game that uses the Source SDK

4528
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
In the Half Life 2 family

4529
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Will let you run this add-on

4530
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
So Portal should do it

4531
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
I guess I'll have to check that out

4532
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
And we'll see if this guy gets banned

4533
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
From all games forever

4534
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Me mishearing you for a second

4535
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
I mean it though

4536
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
You really need to check that game out

4537
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
I think these guys need to be supported

4538
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
I think they spent about 5 years making this mod

4539
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
And it really shows

4540
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I mean the maps

4541
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
They had the original maps from the N64 game

4542
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
And then they built their own maps

4543
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
And you're just like

4544
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
How the heck can they do all this

4545
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
It's just really great

4546
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Well I'm all for supporting the community

4547
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
But Dark Soccer, what did you want to say?

4548
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
I misheard you when you said Team Fortress

4549
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
And for a moment it sounded like you said Team Fortress

4550
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
So now I'm thinking about

4551
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
A big deathmatch game with a bunch of angsty teenagers

4552
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Wouldn't that just be Battle Royale?

4553
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Team Titans

4554
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
You're giving me a mod idea now

4555
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Seriously there should be a Battle Royale mod

4556
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Like you have the jock

4557
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
And then you have the emo kid

4558
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
And you have the goth

4559
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Well you know the emo kid would just be busy cutting himself

4560
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
His hair of course

4561
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Breakfast club frag edition

4562
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Yeah

4563
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
I mean you've got your different classes

4564
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Your clicks

4565
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
And they're a different class

4566
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
The cheerleader

4567
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Is athletic and can kick people in the face

4568
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
And has the booby attack

4569
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Nice

4570
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
And then there's the football player

4571
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Who's like really big and stupid

4572
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Well Kaijuto

4573
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I'm definitely going to have to check out this GoldenEye mod

4574
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Because I did enjoy the GoldenEye on the 64

4575
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
I even really enjoyed what I played

4576
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
The Wii version at E3

4577
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
I didn't want to plunk down 50 bucks for it

4578
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
But maybe when it goes to the bargain bin

4579
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
I'll probably check it out a little more

4580
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Just because my Wii is not really my gaming console

4581
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Of choice right now

4582
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
It's still in a box from when I moved a year ago

4583
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Sad

4584
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
I played the Wii version first

4585
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
And then when I got it on GoldenEye source

4586
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
It totally dwarfed the Wii's version

4587
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
The online part of it

4588
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
I mean they don't have a story version

4589
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
And I do like the Wii's story version of GoldenEye

4590
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
But multiplayer

4591
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
There's nothing like it

4592
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
You really need to check it out

4593
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
When I last heard of this GoldenEye mod

4594
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Specifically it was still in alpha

4595
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
This was months and months ago which is why I never checked it out

4596
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
But the one Half-Life 2 mod

4597
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
I really need to come out this year

4598
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Is Black Mesa

4599
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
The Half-Life 1 remake

4600
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
That's been vaporware for six years

4601
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Now that this GoldenEye

4602
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Is actually in beta and going to have a release

4603
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Version soon

4604
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
This needs to light the fire

4605
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Under the butt of those that are working on Black Mesa source

4606
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
I need it to happen

4607
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Well unfortunately we lost the caller there

4608
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
I don't know if he accidentally hung up on us

4609
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Or if there was a connection issue

4610
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
I swear I didn't click a button to hang up on him

4611
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
And we will definitely check out that game

4612
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
In the future

4613
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
So our Skype line is back open again

4614
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

4615
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
1877 Game OLR is our phone number

4616
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
You can give us a call

4617
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
I'll just throw over to Loki real quick

4618
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
If you have any last minute stories you want to throw out there

4619
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
I don't know

4620
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Just real quick, Arcade Infinity is not closing after all

4621
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
That's right

4622
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
There's a story about that on our very own website

4623
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
And yeah they still had a big party this weekend

4624
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Just to kind of celebrate

4625
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
So that's good

4626
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Well congratulations to Arcade Infinity

4627
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Hopefully it's not like

4628
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Only open for three more months and then

4629
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Psych we closed again

4630
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Well it was some weird thing where like it was actually the city

4631
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
That didn't want them to stay open

4632
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Yeah I heard about that

4633
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Something about their business license being really expensive

4634
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Well let's go to the phones because we got another call on the line

4635
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Hi caller you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

4636
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
This is Brad from Pod Culture

4637
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Hey Brad I haven't heard from you in a long time

4638
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
How are you doing buddy?

4639
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I'm going bald

4640
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Sounds like me

4641
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Well what's new in your world?

4642
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
DC Universe Online

4643
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Ah of course there's a lot of nerds

4644
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Very happy that this is out this week

4645
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
What do you think?

4646
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
I'm loving it

4647
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
It's still got its issues

4648
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Like any of those kind of games at launch

4649
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
But I am really digging it

4650
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Because I am a huge kind of nerd

4651
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
PS3 or PC?

4652
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
PS3

4653
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Actually the way the controls

4654
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Feel

4655
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
It actually feels like it's made for

4656
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
A console

4657
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
You're actually right in that regard

4658
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
I think because even when I was playing it on the PC

4659
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
I plugged in the Xbox 360 controller

4660
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Which is a little weird because the game wasn't made for that

4661
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
But it works

4662
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
And what's really interesting too is that when you do

4663
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Plug in the joystick all the little button

4664
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Symbols change to the Playstation

4665
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
X's and O's

4666
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Which is weird if you're using a 360 controller

4667
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
You've been gaming long enough

4668
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
You know where those buttons are by

4669
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Feel

4670
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
So cool, are you playing a hero or a villain?

4671
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Right now playing a hero

4672
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
And how's that going?

4673
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
What level are you?

4674
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
I am about back up to where I was with the beta

4675
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
I think I'm level 12 or 13

4676
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Nice

4677
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
It was a little bit of an ordeal to get my game

4678
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Oh no

4679
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Amazon screwed up a shipment

4680
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Do you notice there's a lot of people

4681
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
In that right now?

4682
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
I'm getting knocked off

4683
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Every once in a while

4684
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Having some connection issues

4685
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
So I don't know if it's my end here

4686
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Or just that everybody

4687
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Happens to be on the crisis server

4688
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Or not

4689
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
How much patching

4690
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Did you have to do that first day?

4691
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Oh the first day I had about an 11 gig

4692
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Download

4693
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Oh my gosh, 11 gigs?

4694
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
It seemed like it, it took a long time

4695
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
That is

4696
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Crazy, wow

4697
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Well how is it playing an MMO on the PS3?

4698
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Do you think MMOs can work on the PS3?

4699
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Now that this, you know, big

4700
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
Cause I think this is kind of the first one

4701
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
There was APB I guess, but this is really

4702
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
One of the first big ones I guess that's out

4703
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
If they can make it

4704
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
This kind of a controls game

4705
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
It could probably work

4706
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
It's pretty nice

4707
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
Are you able to talk to

4708
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Other people okay?

4709
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
You do not need to do that in your experiences

4710
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
With DC Universe online

4711
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Do you use a keyboard or?

4712
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
You can, I went out and got the

4713
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Keypad for the

4714
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
PS3 controller

4715
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
But

4716
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Apparently you can do some chat

4717
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
But it's a little weird to get it set up and working right

4718
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
You can just use your Bluetooth

4719
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Headset

4720
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Do you find that the text, you can actually read it

4721
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Cause one of the complaints I've heard about the PS3

4722
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Version is that the text is very small on

4723
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
It is a little small but I've got a

4724
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Fairly good size

4725
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
TV so

4726
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
It's alright, it's a little small maybe

4727
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
If you've got a little bit of vision

4728
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Issues you might have a problem

4729
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
But I'm not seeing too much of a

4730
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Problem with it

4731
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
What kind of audience would you recommend

4732
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
This game to? Do you think everybody should be checking

4733
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
It out or is this only for the hardcore right now

4734
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Or what?

4735
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
I mean if you like

4736
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
City of Heroes

4737
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
That kind of stuff, it's definitely worth checking out

4738
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Alright

4739
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
I think I might have to check this out but

4740
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Gosh, games are so expensive these days

4741
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
And I already have one MMO I'm subscribed to

4742
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
I don't need $30 a month

4743
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
To play MMOs, boy oh boy

4744
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Yeah but you can get a good one now

4745
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Nice, I see what you did there

4746
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Alright well Brad, we gotta let you go

4747
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
But do you have any other thoughts for us?

4748
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Nope, nope, just keep on doing what you're doing

4749
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
And we'll keep listening

4750
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Alright thank you so much and check out Brad's show

4751
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
It's available at podculture.net

4752
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Podculture.net and

4753
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Soon to be podculture.com

4754
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Cause we are switching over to a new host

4755
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
We're gonna be an indie show again

4756
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Nice, alright well welcome to the indie

4757
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Realm I suppose and

4758
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
You can of course always look him up on iTunes

4759
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Which is kind of the king of podcasts there

4760
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Alright, take care everybody

4761
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Later guys

4762
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
It's good to hear from Brad, it's been a very long time

4763
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
We've heard from Brad, so glad to hear

4764
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
He's back into gaming with whatever

4765
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
We can probably do at least

4766
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
One more call here, 1-877-GAMELR

4767
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Our username on Skype is

4768
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
OrangeLoungeRadio

4769
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
We'll get to at least one more call here before we wrap it up

4770
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Any other last minute stories?

4771
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Uh, I'm sure

4772
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
I do have some

4773
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Let's see here

4774
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Of course I don't have them pulled up

4775
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Oh that's alright

4776
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
You're saved by the Skype line, but get those up

4777
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
While we take this last call

4778
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

4779
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Oh you seem to always know how to get through

4780
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
What's on your mind buddy?

4781
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Not too much, um

4782
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
In reference to Funko Land, you got me

4783
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Thinking way back

4784
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
As a little kid

4785
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
In elementary school

4786
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Reading the magazines, hearing about the

4787
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Fun Club, going out

4788
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Getting boxes, packing up

4789
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
My Nintendo games, calling

4790
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Them, getting the prices

4791
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Packing it up, sending it to them

4792
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Waiting about a week and a half

4793
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Getting some brand new

4794
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Nintendo games and playing them for hours upon hours

4795
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Oh yeah, that's how

4796
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
I got my copy of Ultima 3 Exodus

4797
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
On the NES was through Funko Land

4798
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
It's not like I remember

4799
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Playing Renegade a long time ago

4800
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Then I remembered that game sometime later

4801
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
And I started getting my hands on that

4802
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
And I believed Dragon Warrior 3

4803
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Uh huh

4804
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
That was my thing

4805
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
It got to the point where I couldn't

4806
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Get all the games I wanted

4807
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
I figured I had all these stacks of games

4808
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Might as well do something with it

4809
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And then I find out there's a Funko Land

4810
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
And then during my

4811
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Junior high and high school years

4812
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
That was my hangout spot

4813
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
I would go there all the time

4814
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
I met a lot of friends and stuff like that

4815
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
And then eventually I stopped

4816
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Going because half the managers got sent

4817
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
To different stores and the newer managers

4818
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Are assholes, so I was like

4819
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
There was no point in going

4820
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
And then one day I just happened to roll in there

4821
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
And I go to the front counter

4822
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
And I'm like, can I get a price sheet?

4823
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
And they're like, we don't do price sheets anymore

4824
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
And you have to go to the back of the line

4825
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
And I turn around

4826
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
I see this long line of people

4827
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
And I said, to hell with this, and I walked out

4828
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Ha ha ha ha

4829
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
So is there a GameStop

4830
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
Where that Funko Land used to sit?

4831
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
Yeah

4832
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Yeah, it really is

4833
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
And

4834
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Where I used to live, one of my best friends

4835
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
From high school, he finally told me

4836
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Like, maybe about six months or so ago

4837
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
They finally turned the

4838
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
Software, etc. in our old shopping center

4839
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Into Funko Land

4840
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Ha ha ha

4841
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Wow

4842
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Yeah, I didn't think it would take like 15 years

4843
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
For them to change the logo on the front

4844
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Uh

4845
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Yeah, you know, there's a store in

4846
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Where was it that we were at?

4847
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
It was in Oregon, and we were in what

4848
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Was it Ashland? No, Medford

4849
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Is the city right north of Ashland

4850
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
When we went inside, it was a GameStop

4851
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
It was just a GameStop

4852
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
They had the white neon software, etc.

4853
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
And it was like 1993 again

4854
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
I know, and I had to buy a game there

4855
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Because I'm like, dude, it's a software center, I gotta buy a game here

4856
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
But even the receipt on it said GameStop

4857
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
It was sad

4858
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Well, slowly everything becomes a part of the machine

4859
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
What do you think about the GameStop ID, though?

4860
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Let me ask you that real quick

4861
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Since you brought up that whole thing

4862
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Because I'm anti-GameStop in the first place

4863
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
You're anti the man

4864
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Stick it to the man

4865
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Yes, I'll say it once, I'll say it again

4866
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Fuck GameStop

4867
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Alright, well on that note, we're gonna let you go, buddy

4868
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Cool

4869
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
But have a good one

4870
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Reminiscing about the good old days with

4871
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
DJ Rama S

4872
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Any other last minute stories?

4873
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
Loki?

4874
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Um, yeah, a couple things

4875
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
This is actually kind of funny

4876
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
2, you know, the new one that's coming out on PSP

4877
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
They're actually selling it in a 2-pack

4878
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
In, um,

4879
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Japan

4880
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
It's a double enlistment pack

4881
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
It contains two UMD copies of the game

4882
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
In their full packaging

4883
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Bundled together for

4884
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:54,000
6,279 yen

4885
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Versus

4886
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Buying two 5,040 yen copies

4887
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
So you're saving almost

4888
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Almost the price of one whole copy

4889
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Nice, I like these whole

4890
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Buy multiples, get one free

4891
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Alright, I lied, we're gonna take one more call

4892
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Because it's still ringing

4893
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
So I guess I don't know why everybody wants to call tonight

4894
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Some nights we're sitting here begging for calls

4895
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
But some nights, we got a busy line

4896
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
So, hi, you're on Orange on Australia, who's this?

4897
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
This is the head of the anti-Bimani

4898
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
In the USL Madness tournament

4899
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Hi, Bobby, how are you?

4900
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
I'm doing good

4901
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
You guys have a good show tonight

4902
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Yeah, I'm having a good time

4903
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
I hope you've had a good time listening

4904
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
You always have us on at the end of your show

4905
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
So I'm always happy when you're able to get in

4906
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Amongst the Skype Madness and be on the end of our show

4907
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
That's right

4908
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
I want everybody to vote against Poppin

4909
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
And Para Para

4910
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
And DDR, which got a buy

4911
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
How did that even get in there?

4912
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Because too many people put it up towards the top of their list

4913
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
You have to remember, our station started as a museum

4914
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
So a lot of the people

4915
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
We have a lot of players, the thick and thin

4916
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
And some of the tough decisions we've made

4917
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
But we do have a lot of fans of that

4918
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
And, obviously, USL has their listenership as well

4919
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
But I know a lot of it is crossover

4920
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
This show, in some ways, was a spinoff of USL

4921
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
So we have many listeners from back in that day

4922
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
And I'm gonna say

4923
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
I'm like you, I wouldn't be mad

4924
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
If Final Fantasy VI won

4925
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
As long as Super Metroid doesn't win

4926
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Oh, hater, why you hating?

4927
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Why you hating on Super Metroid?

4928
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Because it sucks

4929
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
It does not suck

4930
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
It's the most amazing video game ever made

4931
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Why are you hating on Super Metroid?

4932
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Because Super Metroid mimics a vacuum

4933
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
Is it sad that I actually had to stop and think about that one for it?

4934
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
I'm like, you don't play in a vacuum

4935
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
What are you talking about?

4936
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Oh, you Bobby

4937
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Curse you, Bobby

4938
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Bobby, you just launched a new website for your show, right?

4939
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
I did, bobbyblackwolf.com

4940
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
And the podcast is back

4941
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
The podcast feed is more up to date than ours

4942
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
But that will all change this week

4943
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Here's the thing, my episode from tonight

4944
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Already on the podcast feed

4945
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Wow, amazing

4946
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
That hasn't happened in three years

4947
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Good gosh

4948
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
You need to cancel doing second shows more often

4949
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Exactly

4950
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
And I reviewed the Telltale game Back to the Future

4951
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
On my show

4952
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
So people can go check that out

4953
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
I guess we have to go check it out to see what you really think

4954
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
But I was gonna say

4955
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
Earlier, I'm really looking forward to the Jurassic Park game

4956
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
I don't know why, but

4957
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
I think it's because I like the books when I was younger

4958
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
And I remember seeing the original movies

4959
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Except three, who bothered with three

4960
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
But I'm kind of excited

4961
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
To revisit those

4962
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
Because it's been a long time since those movies were out

4963
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
And that whole

4964
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Stuff was big

4965
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
They never did make a fourth movie

4966
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
I don't know if they were ever going to

4967
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
But it would be kind of fun to revisit that world, I think

4968
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Yeah, and one of the things is when Heavy Rain came out

4969
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
I even said

4970
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
I would love to play a Telltale game like

4971
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Sam & Max using the Heavy Rain style of

4972
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Controls

4973
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
And now that's what they're going to be doing for

4974
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Jurassic Park

4975
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Doing more Heavy Rain type stuff

4976
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Than just point and click adventures

4977
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
And hopefully if it works for Jurassic Park

4978
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
They'll do that in Sam & Max

4979
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
And probably add some of that

4980
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
Will there be a Jason scene in Jurassic Park?

4981
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Jason!

4982
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
And I want to see a T-Rex holding a red balloon

4983
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
And it's going

4984
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
And it's going

4985
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
And it's going

4986
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Jason!

4987
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Can't wait

4988
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Alright Bobby, anything else on your mind tonight

4989
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Before we wrap up our little show here?

4990
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
No, I mean

4991
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Breslow wants to kick me, but once again

4992
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Vote against DDR

4993
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
He'll deal with it

4994
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
Every gamer has a voice

4995
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Even when they're wrong, like you are

4996
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
All I gotta say is the next

4997
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Was it Poker Night

4998
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
At the inventory or whatever?

4999
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
It's going to be awesome

5000
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
Was it Christopher Lloyd

5001
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
And a T-Rex

5002
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
And a Velociraptor

5003
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
I'm the whole Jason

5004
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Alright

5005
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Bobby, thanks so much for your call

5006
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Take care

5007
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Thank you

5008
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Bobby Blackwolf, the man who does the show before us

5009
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
You go all in on the next Poker Night

5010
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
At the inventory at the Velociraptor

5011
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
He's so pissed, he just eats strong bad

5012
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Violently, gruesomely

5013
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
That's great

5014
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Alright, any other last minute stories

5015
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Before we wrap up the show tonight

5016
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Minecraft has sold a million copies

5017
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Which is pretty awesome

5018
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
They have a new update for that

5019
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
As well that adds

5020
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
I still haven't played it, am I a bad gamer?

5021
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
I haven't really played it either

5022
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
I'm a bad gamer

5023
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Let's see

5024
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
They added

5025
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Some new recipes including

5026
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Squids and cake

5027
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Yes

5028
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
So you can get cake in the game

5029
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
And I guess squids are a new enemy of course

5030
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
So that's pretty cool

5031
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
And yeah I guess from the squids

5032
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
You can harvest black ink

5033
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
For a new dye mechanic

5034
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Let's see what else

5035
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Remedy is bringing Death Rally

5036
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
For the iPhone

5037
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
Death Rally you may remember

5038
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
As an old

5039
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Apogee game

5040
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Back from 1996

5041
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Kind of a top down

5042
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Combat racing game

5043
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Which is kind of cool

5044
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
And then speaking of

5045
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
IOS, the iPad has

5046
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
A bunch of ridiculous peripherals

5047
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
That were being shown off at

5048
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
CES and of course

5049
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
One of these is the

5050
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
iCade which transforms to your

5051
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
iPod or your iPad I guess

5052
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Into an arcade and you can get that ThinkGeek

5053
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
For $100 or if you don't want to

5054
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Spend $100 but you still want

5055
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Some sort of tactile controller

5056
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
They have a stick on

5057
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Joystick actually

5058
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
For $25 and it just

5059
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Sticks onto your

5060
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
iPad

5061
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Maybe Apple should release one

5062
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
I think they should

5063
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Honestly I think they should have something

5064
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
The iPhone or whatever plugs into

5065
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Apple if they want to just do Bluetooth

5066
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Support for controllers or something

5067
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
That would be awesome

5068
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
It's what the people want

5069
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Now that Verizon has their iPhone they're just going to sell even more

5070
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Of them and it's just like if they were to release

5071
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Just a little controller that plugs into

5072
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
The bottom of those phones I tell you it's over

5073
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Yeah

5074
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
So

5075
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Is that it? That's it

5076
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Alright well that's going to do it for another episode

5077
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000

We want to get everybody's final thought

5094
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
So let's just pop I'll start with you

5095
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Thank you for filling in tonight stepping up to the plate

5096
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
I know you didn't get a lot of notice on that

5097
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
So I appreciate you doing that for us

5098
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
My pleasure

5099
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
And do you have a final thought for us tonight?

5100
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Um no I'm good

5101
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Vietnamese noodles after this yay

5102
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
And we had blood orange pinkberry

5103
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Blood orange pinkberry is the best thing ever

5104
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
So good

5105
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
That is my final thought blood orange pinkberry

5106
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
If you have a pinkberry anywhere near you

5107
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
I've never had better yogurt in my life

5108
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
It is great they need to keep that as a permanent flavor

5109
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
If they get rid of that I'm going to be pissed

5110
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Yeah I'm excited about food again

5111
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
Uber noms

5112
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Darsakra your final thought tonight?

5113
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
I had a lot of beer today

5114
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Congratulations and Loki your final thought tonight

5115
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
My final thought is

5116
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
This umm

5117
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Aliens game looks weird

5118
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Oh that whole square

5119
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
one that was designed back in the day

5120
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
It looks like

5121
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
I don't know like a side scrolling

5122
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Metal gear or something

5123
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Alright that's going to do it
